    "the trajectory of a particle embedded in a complex or even some seemingly simple structures may exhibit simultaneous modes of motion @xcite . an example is deterministic transport of a tracer particle in an infinite horizon ordered lorentz billiard , a set of fixed circular hard scatterers arranged in a square lattice @xcite .",
    "a tracer moving freely among a set of scatterers and bouncing elastically once encountering one of them , exhibits intermittent behavior with long flights where the particle moves ballistically , separated by collision events which induce a diffusive like motion .",
    "a similar behavior of the tracing particle can be induced by the flow acting in the phase space of chaotic hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "the key to our discussion are power law distributed waiting times between collision events , induced by the geometry of the scatterers @xcite .",
    "a condition for such non - drude like dynamics is that the radii of scatterers is smaller than half the lattice spacing and that the tracer is a point like particle , hence the tracer has an infinite horizon @xcite . also consider the very different type of motion of polymeric particles in living cells , where sub - diffusive motion is separated by long power law distributed flights which induce super - diffusion @xcite .",
    "such systems are difficult to characterize since they exhibit at least two modes of motion .",
    "a common tool in the analysis of such data is the spectrum of exponents @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one measures the @xmath1-th moment of the motion , for particles starting on a common origin @xmath7 with @xmath8 . here ,",
    "for sake of simplicity we consider the one dimensional case and avoid other possible time dependencies like a logarithmic increase of moments with time .",
    "scale invariant transport implies that @xmath9 is a constant independent of @xmath1 , for example , for brownian motion @xmath10 . in many fields of science one",
    "finds that @xmath9 is a non - linear function of @xmath1 , the term strong anomalous diffusion is often used in this context @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , in many cases the continuous spectrum @xmath6 exhibits a bi - linear scaling ( see details below ) .",
    "examples for this piecewise linear behavior of @xmath6 include nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite , stochastic models with quenched and annealed disorder , in particular , the lvy walk @xcite and sand pile models @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on the active transport of polymers in the cell @xcite , theoretical investigation of the momentum @xcite and the spatial @xcite spreading of cold atoms in optical lattices and flows in porous media @xcite further confirmed the generality of strong anomalous diffusion of the bi - linear type .",
    "an example is a diffusive scaling @xmath11 below a certain value of @xmath12 and a ballistic scaling @xmath13 otherwise .",
    "this is an example of a motion which is neither purely diffusive nor ballistic .    while the mechanisms leading to strong anomalous diffusion could be vast ,",
    "even the stochastic treatment of such systems is not well understood .",
    "for example , diffusion equations , either normal or fractional @xcite , stochastic frameworks like fractional brownian motion or generalized langevin equations @xcite and the gauss - lvy central limit theorem @xcite fail to describe this phenomena .",
    "we recently investigated the lvy walk process @xcite , a well known stochastic model of many natural behaviors which exhibits bi - linear strong anomalous diffusion .",
    "examining four special cases we found that a non - normalizable density , with a diverging area underneath it , describes these processes @xcite .",
    "this unusual infinite density , describes the ballistic aspects of strong anomalous diffusion .",
    "here we find a general formula for the infinite density which , as we show below , is complementary to the gauss and lvy distributions .",
    "the latter are the mathematical basis of many diffusive phenomena , and here we promote the idea that the infinite density concept is a rather general tool statistically characterizing the ballistic trait of the motion .",
    "we show how these unnormalized distributions emerge from a basic model with wide applications , thus , possibly this overlooked measure may become an important tool .    in mathematics the concept of a non - normalized infinite density",
    "was thoroughly investigated @xcite while in physics this idea has gained interest only recently ( see below ) .",
    "conservation of matter implies that the number of particles in the system is fixed , thus naturally one may normalize the probability density describing a packet of non - interacting diffusing particles @xmath14 to unity @xmath15 .",
    "hence dynamical and equilibrium properties of most physical systems are described by densities which are normalized , for example , a boltzmann - gibbs state in thermal equilibrium , or solutions of boltzmann or fokker - planck equations with normalization conserving boundary conditions ( no absorbing boundaries ) . however , in some cases a closer distinction must be made , namely a distinction based on the observable of interest . probably the most common averaged observables are the moments @xmath16 of a process @xmath17 , so in this example the observable is @xmath18 and we will distinguish between high order moments @xmath3 and low order ones . in our case",
    "we treat a system with mixed dynamics , and show that the low order moments are described by the standard machinery of non - equilibrium statistical physics ( fractional diffusion equations and lvy central limit theorem ) but the high order moments , which represent the ballistic elements of the process , are described by an infinite density . in this sense",
    "the infinite density is complementary to the central limit theorem @xcite .",
    "we find a general formula for this infinite density relating it to the velocity distribution of the particles , the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath4 and the diffusion constant @xmath5 .",
    "our work shows how the unnormalized state emerges from the norm conserving dynamics of the lvy walk .",
    "previous work @xcite on applications of the infinite density in physics , dealt with bounded systems which attain an equilibrium .",
    "for example the momentum distribution of cold atoms where the gibbs - measure is finite the infinite density describes the large rare fluctuations of the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "or intermittent maps with unstable fixed points , e.g. , the pomeau - manneville transformation on the unit interval @xcite . here",
    "we consider systems that are not in equilibrium , and the dynamics is unbounded , showing that the potential applications of infinite densities are vast .",
    "in the lvy walk process the trajectory of the particle @xmath17 consists of epochs of ballistic travel separated by a set of collisions which alter its velocity @xcite . at time",
    "@xmath19 the particle is on the origin .",
    "its initial velocity @xmath20 is random and drawn from a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath21 , whose moments are all non - diverging @xcite .",

    "the second displacement is @xmath28 .",
    "this process is renewed .",
    "the waiting times @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and the velocities @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are mutually independent identically distributed random variables .",
    "the points on the time axis @xmath33 are the collision times , when the particle switches its velocity .",
    "the position of the particle at time @xmath34 is @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the random number of collisions or renewals in the time interval @xmath37 .",

    "( [ eqmodel00 ] ) describes the motion between the last collision event and the measurement time @xmath34 @xmath39 a model where @xmath36 is fixed and @xmath34 is random , namely , a process stopped after @xmath36 collisions ( so @xmath40 ) is the classical problem of summation of independent identically distributed random variables for which the lvy - gauss central limit theorem applies @xcite .    as already mentioned , we assume that @xmath41 hence from symmetry the density of particles @xmath14 is also symmetric since all particles start on the origin .",
    "we also assume that the even moments of @xmath21 are finite , hence the tail of @xmath21 decays faster than any power law .",
    "the pdf of waiting times is given in the long time limit by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 as discussed briefly in the summary , our main finding , that a non - normalized infinite density describes the density of particles @xmath14 , is found also for @xmath45 , but for simplicity of presentation we consider only a limited interval for @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath46 corresponds to enhanced diffusion @xmath47 which is faster than normal diffusion but slower than ballistic @xcite .",
    "the regime @xmath48 , is called the ballistic phase of the motion since then @xmath49 . for that case and for a general class of the velocity pdf , @xmath21 , the pdf @xmath14 is given by a formula in @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath50 corresponds to normal diffusion in the mean square displacement sense @xmath51 .",
    "a convenient tool is the laplace transform of the waiting times pdf denoted @xmath52 for a power law distributed waiting time under investigation , i.e. , @xmath46 , and for small @xmath53 the following expansion holds @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the averaged waiting time .",
    "the position of the particle is rewritten as @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the flight lengths and @xmath58 . since the velocity distribution is narrow and symmetric , the pdf of flight lengths @xmath59 is also symmetric @xmath60 .",
    "since the durations of the flights are power law distributed we have @xmath61 for large @xmath62 . in the regime",
    "@xmath63 the variance of jump length is infinite hence the gaussian central limit theorem does not apply . in the regime",
    "@xmath46 the average waiting time @xmath64 is finite . neglecting fluctuations , the number of flights is @xmath65 when @xmath34 is long .",
    "hence in this over - simplified picture we are dealing with a problem of a sum of @xmath36 independent identically distributed random variables with a common pdf @xmath59 with a diverging variance . in this picture",
    "the last jump @xmath66 is negligible .",
    "thus , one may argue that @xmath67 is described by lvy s generalized central limit theorem .",
    "this means that the pdf of @xmath67 is expected to be a symmetric lvy stable law @xcite ( see details below ) .",
    "however , such a treatment ignores the correlations between flight durations and flight lengths and the fluctuations of @xmath36 .",
    "in fact the finite speed of the particles implies that jumps much larger than the typical velocity times the measurement time @xmath34 are impossible .",
    "thus , the mean square displacement and higher order moments always increase slower than ballistic , for example @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast , a sum of independent identically distributed random variables with an infinite variance , often called a lvy flight , yields a diverging mean square displacement @xmath69 .",
    "for that reason lvy walks , which take into consideration the finite velocity , are considered more physical if compared with lvy flights @xcite .",
    "since both the gauss and the lvy central limit theorems break down in the description of moments of lvy walks , more specifically in the tails of the pdf of @xmath67 , it is natural to ask if there exists a mathematical replacement for these widely applied theorems .",
    "a more serious treatment of the lvy walk is given in terms of the montroll - weiss equation .",
    "let @xmath14 be the pdf of the position of particles at time @xmath34 for particles starting at the origin . from the mentioned symmetry of the process @xmath70",
    ", @xmath71 so clearly all odd moments of @xmath14 are zero .",
    "we define the fourier - laplace transform @xmath72 the montroll - weiss equation gives the relation between the distributions of the model parameters namely velocities and waiting times with @xmath73 @xcite @xmath74 here the averages are with respect to the velocity distribution @xmath75 . the derivation of this classical result is provided in an appendix .",
    "note that in the original work of montroll and weiss a decoupled random walk was considered and the origin of eq .",

    "we naively expect that one can reconstruct the normalized density of particles in the long time limit from the exact expressions for the moments of the process .",
    "specifically , we obtain the exact expression for the long time limit of the integer moments of the lvy walk process @xmath76 with @xmath77 , where the case @xmath78 is trivial since @xmath79 , and then we use the moments to consruct a series equivalent to the fourier transform of the density @xmath80 luckily , we can evaluate analytically the sum for the model under consideration .",

    "<S> motion of particles in many systems exhibits a mixture between periods of random diffusive like events and ballistic like motion . in many cases , such systems exhibit strong anomalous diffusion , where low order moments @xmath0 with @xmath1 below a critical value @xmath2 exhibit diffusive scaling while for @xmath3 a ballistic scaling emerges . </S>",
    "<S> the mixed dynamics constitutes a theoretical challenge since it does not fall into a unique category of motion , e.g. , the known diffusion equations and central limit theorems fail to describe both aspects . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we resolve this problem by resorting to the concept of infinite density . using the widely applicable lvy walk model , we find a general expression for the corresponding non - normalized density which is fully determined by the particles velocity distribution , the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath4 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we explain how infinite densities play a central role in the description of dynamics of a large class of physical processes and discuss how they can be evaluated from experimental or numerical data . </S>"
