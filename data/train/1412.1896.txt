    "roughly speaking a regular subspace of a dirichlet form is a subspace which is also a regular dirichlet form on the same state space .",
    "the characterization of regular subspaces of dirichlet forms is a basic problem in the theory of dirichlet forms . up to now",
    ", the only result was stated in @xcite in which a complete characterization for regular subspaces of one - dimensional brownian motion is given .",
    "in fact such a regular subspace may be characterized by a measure - dense set @xmath0 , by which we mean that @xmath3 has positive measure for any non - empty interval @xmath4 and the markov process associated with the regular subspace is the one - dimensional diffusion with scale function @xmath5 and speed measure being lebesgue measure .",
    "it is seen from the scale function that the process corresponding to the regular subspace moves like brownian motion on @xmath0 more or less but spends almost no time on @xmath6 though it runs all over @xmath6 which has positive measure .",
    "it is always interesting for us to explore the precise structure of regular subspaces of one - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "we are curious about how the process moves precisely on @xmath6 or what we can say about the structure of it on @xmath6 .",
    "the approach we use to explore the structure is the method of trace .",
    "generally a dirichlet form may be decomposed into a minimal process on an open subset @xmath0 and its orthogonal complement , which is called the trace of dirichlet form on @xmath6 .",
    "usually the trace is the dirichlet form corresponding to the process obtained by the original process through a time change induced by a positive continuous additive functional . how to describe the trace of a form dates back to j. douglas who gave a complete characterization of the trace of the form associated to brownian motion living on closed unit disc on its boundary in @xcite .",
    "the similar characterization has been done for general symmetric dirichlet form by the second author and his co - authors in @xcite and @xcite . in the current article",
    ", we shall prove that when the measure - dense @xmath0 is open and @xmath1 has positive measure , the trace @xmath7 of 1-dim brownian motion @xmath8 on @xmath1 is non - trivial and ( its beurling - deny decomposition ) has both diffusion part and jump part as expected , the trace @xmath9 of the regular subspace @xmath10 of @xmath8 is a regular subspace of the trace brownian motion @xmath11 which has only the jump part , and finally the remaining part is the orthogonal complement of the regular subspace whose beurling - deny decomposition has only the diffusion part . in addition , we show that the regular representation of the orthogonal complement is the darning transform of brownian motion . from this result",
    "we can see that though the process @xmath10 corresponding to the regular subspace moves continuously on @xmath2 but it looks like jumping due to the special structure of @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , it ` flies like the wind and leaves no shadow ' .",
    "let @xmath12 be a locally compact separable metric space and @xmath13 a radon measure on @xmath12 .",
    "we refer the terminologies of dirichlet forms on the hilbert space @xmath14 to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "assume that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two regular dirichlet forms on @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath15 is called a _ regular subspace _ of @xmath16 , denoted by @xmath17 or @xmath18 , if @xmath19 if in addition @xmath20 is a proper subset of @xmath21 , then we say @xmath15 is a _ proper regular subspace _ of @xmath16 .",
    "we denote the lebesgue measure on @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "it is well known that the 1-dimensional brownian motion is symmetric with respect to @xmath23 and its associated dirichlet form on @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the 1-sobolev space and for any @xmath27 , @xmath28 as outlined in @xcite and @xcite , fix a strictly increasing and absolutely continuous function @xmath29 on @xmath22 satisfying @xmath30 and define a symmetric bilinear form @xmath31 on @xmath24 by @xmath32 where @xmath33 means @xmath34 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath29 . then @xmath31 is a regular subspace of @xmath35 and @xmath29 is called the scaling function of @xmath31 .",
    "the associated diffusion of @xmath31 is denoted by @xmath10 . moreover @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the extended dirichlet spaces of @xmath35 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath38 on the contrary if @xmath39 is a regular subspace of @xmath35 , there always exists a strictly increasing and absolutely continuous function @xmath29 on @xmath22 such that @xmath40 . to see this we refer the recurrent case to theorem  2.1 of @xcite .",
    "generally since @xmath35 is strongly local and irreducible , it follows from theorem  4.6.4 of @xcite and theorem  1 of @xcite that @xmath39 is also strongly local and irreducible .",
    "the irreducibility of @xmath39 implies that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the class of probability measures of associated diffusion @xmath43 of @xmath39 and @xmath44 is the hitting time of @xmath45 relative to @xmath43 , see theorem  4.7.1 of @xcite .",
    "then from @xcite we can deduce that @xmath43 can be characterized by a scaling function @xmath29 and symmetric measure @xmath23 .",
    "in particular it corresponds to dirichlet form .",
    "fix a regular subspace @xmath31 of @xmath35 and its scaling function @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath46 then @xmath0 is defined in the sense of almost everywhere and for any finite open interval @xmath47 it holds that @xmath48 note that the condition of @xmath0 is equivalent to that @xmath29 is strictly increasing . in particular @xmath31 is a proper regular subspace of @xmath49 if and only if the lebesgue measure of @xmath50 is positive , i.e. @xmath51 . on the other side if we have a subset @xmath0 of @xmath22 such that holds for any open interval @xmath52 , then @xmath53 defines a class of scaling functions satisfying , whereas they only differ up to a constant . in other words ,",
    "the subset @xmath0 satisfying is one - to - one corresponding to the scaling function @xmath29 with condition up to a constant .",
    "thus @xmath0 is an essential characteristic of @xmath31 .    in this paper",
    "we shall always make the following assumption on @xmath0 :    ( * h * ) : :    @xmath0 is open and @xmath51 .",
    "in fact the typical example of @xmath2 is a generalized cantor set which is actually closed .",
    "hence this assumption is very natural .",
    "but we still want to point out that this assumption is not trivial .",
    "an example of a set @xmath0 satisfying but having no open version can be constructed as follows .",
    "take a set @xmath54 such that for any finite open interval @xmath55 , it holds that @xmath56 we refer the existence of @xmath57 to  1.5 of @xcite . but @xmath57 has no open a.e . version . to this end , assume that @xmath0 is an open a.e .",

    "version of @xmath0 and the complement of it has no isolated points . in the sequel",
    ", we shall impose this assumption .    since @xmath0 is open ,",

    "denote all finite endpoints of @xmath66 by @xmath67 and let @xmath68 for any @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath70 and any point in @xmath71 is a limitation of a subsequence of @xmath72 . clearly any two different intervals @xmath73 and @xmath74 can not share a common endpoint due to our assumption that @xmath2 has no isolated points .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ tbm ] we shall first prove that before leaving @xmath0 , the diffusion @xmath10 is equivalent to one - dimensional brownian motion , see lemma  [ thm1 ] . then as outlined in theorem  [ thm4 ] we find that the trace dirichlet form of @xmath31 on @xmath2 is a regular subspace of trace dirichlet form of @xmath35 on @xmath2 .",
    "moreover the former dirichlet form is a non - local dirichlet form whereas the latter one is a mix - type dirichlet form .",
    "their common jumping measure @xmath75 is supported on countable points in @xmath76 : @xmath77 where @xmath78 are endpoints of @xmath73 in .",
    "in particular , @xmath79 thus we write the precise expressions of these two trace dirichlet forms in theorem  [ thm5 ] .",
    "since the smaller trace dirichlet form only inherits the non - local part of bigger one , our concern in  [ oco ] is whether and how we can describe the remaining information , i.e. the strongly local part , of trace dirichlet form of one - dimensional brownian motion on @xmath2 . in order to do",

    "@xmath81 can actually be realized as a regular strongly local dirichlet form and this regular dirichlet form is a regular representation of @xmath81 in the context of @xcite , see theorem  [ prop5 ] .",

    "this orthogonal complement exactly inherits the strongly local part of trace brownian motion on @xmath2 outlined in theorem  [ thm5 ] .",
