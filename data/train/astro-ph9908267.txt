    "a new generation of astronomical instrumentations is now making it possible to image the thermal emission from the disks of dust that surround some stars .",
    "the disks that have been imaged around main sequence stars ( i.e. , the vega - type , or debris , disks ) have aroused considerable interest because it is hoped that interpretation of their structure will provide valuable information about the evolution of planetary systems , possibly even leading to the indirect detection of planets hiding in the disks .",
    "one such disk is that around the a0v star hr 4796a .",
    "mid - ir ( 10 - 20 @xmath1 m ) images of the hr 4796 disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) show that its emission is concentrated in two lobes , one on either side of the star , indicating that the disk is being observed nearly edge - on , and that its inner region is almost completely devoid of dust . the same double - lobed feature is seen in nicmos ( 1.1 @xmath1 m ) images of the disk s scattered light ( @xcite ) .",
    "the size of the disk s central cavity , which was previously inferred from the star s spectral energy distribution ( @xcite ) , is approximately 40 au in radius from the star , about the same size as the solar planetary system . since the age of the hr 4796 system , @xmath2 myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) places it at a stage in its evolution when the formation of any planets is expected to be almost complete ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "many authors have speculated that the central cavity could be indicative of planetary formation in this inner region ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a similar double - lobed feature has been observed in the disk around the star fomalhaut , with a similar explanation proposed for its origin ( @xcite ) .",
    "some authors , however , remain skeptical about the existence of planets in these systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the hr 4796 disk show a further interesting feature : the disk s lobes appear to be of unequal brightness , although this observed asymmetry is of low statistical significance ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "mid - ir observations of the disk are described in a companion paper by telesco et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter t99 ) , and their ihw18 ( 18.2 @xmath1 m ) waveband observation ( their fig .",
    "4b ) is reproduced in this paper in fig .",
    "their observation suggests that the ne lobe ( on the left of the image in fig .",
    "[ fig8]a ) is @xmath0% brighter than the sw lobe .",
    "this lobe asymmetry may also be apparent in the nicmos ( 1.1 @xmath1 m ) images of the disk ( @xcite ) , and in the @xmath4 @xmath1 m images of koerner et al .",
    "the brightnesses of the fomalhaut disk s lobes also appear to be asymmetric ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are many possible explanations for the hr 4796 disk s lobe asymmetry .",
    "this paper describes a model of the t99 observation that provides one possible dynamical explanation for the asymmetry : that it is the long - term consequence of the gravitational perturbations of one or more massive bodies on the disk ( i.e. , the consequence of the system s `` secular perturbations '' ) .    quite apart from any speculation about a nascent planetary system in the inner region of the hr 4796 disk , we know that the disk must have been gravitationally perturbed , since hr",
    "4796 is a visual binary system .",
    "the m dwarf star hr 4796b , located at a projected distance of @xmath5 au ( @xcite ) , is the common proper motion companion of hr 4796a ( @xcite ) .",
    "an understanding of how asymmetries in the observed structure of the zodiacal cloud , the tenuous disk of dust in the solar system , are linked to the solar system s planets ( @xcite ) , shows that if there is at least one massive perturber in the hr 4796 system that is on an eccentric orbit , then the system s secular perturbations would have caused the disk s center of symmetry to be offset from the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "this offset would mean that the material in one of the disk s observed lobes is closer to the star than that in the other lobe ; consequently this lobe would be hotter and brighter .",
    "the aim of this paper is to ascertain how large the perturbations would have to be to cause the observed 5% asymmetry , and to discuss whether perturbations of this magnitude are physically realistic , or even to be expected , in this system .",
    "since this paper is based on the interpretation of a circumstellar disk observation , it starts in  [ sec - ocd ] with a consideration of how information about a disk is stored in an observation . ",
    "[ sec - ddc ] gives a comprehensive discussion of the physical processes that govern the dynamical evolution of a disk s particles , and sets up a broad theoretical framework ( the `` dynamic disk '' ) with which to investigate a disk s structure .",
    " [ sec - spd ] then shows how secular perturbations cause a disk s structure to have offset and warp asymmetries , and provides evidence that these asymmetries have been observed in the structure of the zodiacal cloud . ",
    "[ sec - hr4796 ] uses the theoretical discussions of   [ sec - ocd]-[sec - spd ] to create an offset model for the hr 4796 disk that matches the 18.2 @xmath1 m brightness distribution observed by t99 .",
    "the interpretation of this model is discussed in ",
    "[ sec - disc ] .",
    "the observed brightness of a circumstellar disk comes from two sources : starlight that has been absorbed by the disk particles and re - emitted as thermal radiation ( primarily at mid - ir , far - ir , and submillimeter wavelengths at @xmath6 @xmath1 m ) , and starlight that has been scattered by the disk particles ( primarily at optical and near - ir wavelengths at @xmath7 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "this paper only discusses a disk s thermal emission .",
    "a particle of diameter @xmath8 , that is at a distance @xmath9 from a star , is heated by the stellar radiation to a temperature @xmath10 that can be calculated from the equilibrium between the energy that the particle absorbs and that which it re - emits as thermal radiation .",
    "this temperature depends on the particle s optical properties ( @xcite ) : @xmath11^{1/4}*t_{bb } , \\label{eq : tdr}\\ ] ] where this equation must be solved iteratively , since the particle s temperature appears on both sides of the equation , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the particle s absorption efficiency averaged over the stellar spectrum ( which can be approximated as that of a black body radiating at the star s effective temperature @xmath14 ) and the spectrum of a black body radiating at a temperature @xmath10 , and @xmath15 is the equilibrium temperature of the particle if it were a black body : @xmath16 where @xmath15 is given in k , @xmath17 is the ratio of the particle s cross - sectional area to its surface area ( e.g. , spherical particles have @xmath18 and @xmath19 , giving @xmath20 ) , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the luminosities of the star and the sun .",
    "if this particle is at a distance @xmath23 from the earth , the contribution of its thermal emission to the flux density at a wavelength , @xmath24 , received at the earth is given by : @xmath25\\omega(d ) ,    \\label{eq : flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the planck function , and @xmath27 is the solid angle subtended at the earth by the cross - sectional area of the particle .",
    "a circumstellar disk consists of particles with a range of sizes , compositions and morphologies . throughout this paper , however , disk particles are assumed to have the same composition and morphology , and a particle s size is characterized by its diameter , @xmath8 .",
    "disk particles span a range of sizes from @xmath28 , the smallest ( probably submicron - sized ) particles sustainable for a given disk , up to @xmath29 , the largest ( probably kilometer - sized ) members of the disk that were formed from the proto - planetary disk .",
    "the spatial distribution of these particles can be defined by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the volume density ( number per unit volume ) of particles in the size range @xmath32 at a location in the disk defined by @xmath9 , the radial distance from the star , @xmath33 , the longitude relative to an arbitrary direction , and @xmath34 , the latitude relative to an arbitrary reference plane . however , since it is a particle s cross - sectional area that is apparent in an observation ( eq .  [ [ eq : flux ] ] ) , a disk s observable structure is better defined in terms of @xmath35 , the cross - sectional area per unit volume per unit diameter .",
    "the definition of a disk s structure can be simplified by assuming the size distribution of its particles to be independent of @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the proportion of the total cross - sectional area of the disk at @xmath9 that is in particles in the size range @xmath32 , and @xmath38 is the spatial distribution of cross - sectional area of particles of all sizes in the disk .      to determine the observed brightness of a circumstellar disk in , for example , one pixel of an image of the disk , two components of the observation",
    "must be defined : the vector , @xmath39 , which extends from the observer to the disk , and which describes how the line of sight intersects the disk in terms of @xmath9 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ; and the solid angle of the observation , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 for pixels of width @xmath42 radians .",
    "consider a volume element along this line of sight that is at a location in the disk defined by @xmath43 , and that has a length @xmath44 ; the element volume is @xmath45 .",
    "the contribution of the thermal emission of the particles in this element to the disk s brightness in the observation is given by : @xmath46      \\sigma(d , r,\\theta,\\phi)dd \\mathbf{dr } ,       \\label{eq : brightness } \\\\      & = & p(\\lambda , r)\\sigma(r,\\theta,\\phi)\\mathbf{dr } , \\label{eq : fnu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where equation ( [ eq : fnu ] ) uses the simplification for the disk structure given by equation ( [ eq : sig2 ] ) , and @xmath47\\bar{\\sigma}(d , r)dd .",
    "\\label{eq : p}\\ ] ] thus , the brightness of this element is not affected by the solid angle of the observation , neither is it affected by the distance of the element from the earth .    equation ( [ eq : p ] ) can also be written as : @xmath48      \\rangle_{\\sigma(d , r ) } ; \\label{eq : p2}\\ ] ] i.e. , @xmath49 is the combination of the particles optical properties given by @xmath50 $ ] averaged over the disk s cross - sectional area distribution , @xmath51 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 can also be given by : @xmath52 ,      \\label{eq : pdtyp}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the size of disk particle that characterizes ( and hence dominates ) the disk s emission .",
    "this characteristic particle size could be different in different wavebands , as well as at different distances from the star , but always lies in the range @xmath54 ; its value can be found by considering the relative contribution of particles of different sizes to @xmath49 . however , unless the optical properties of the particles prevent it , the particles that dominate a disk s emission are also those that contribute most to its cross - sectional area , i.e. , they are those that dominate the disk s structure , @xmath55 .",
    "this is usually the case for mid - ir ( @xmath56 @xmath1 m ) observations , such as those of t99 ( see e.g. ,  [ ssec - mpp ] ) .",
    "the total brightness of the disk in this observation is the integral of equation ( [ eq : brightness ] ) over @xmath39 .",
    "thus , a disk observation is composed of three parts : the disk s structure , the optical properties of the disk particles , and the orientation of the disk to the line of sight .",
    "an image of the disk is made up of many pixels , each of which has a different line of sight vector , @xmath39 , and corresponding brightness .",
    "the image at the detector has been convolved with the observational point spread function ( psf ) , a combination of the seeing conditions and the telescope and instrumental optics , which , in the diffraction - limited case , for an ideal instrument , can be approximated as gaussian smoothing with @xmath57 , where this @xmath8 is the diameter of the telescope .",
    "the observed image also contains photospheric emission from the point - like star , as well as random noise fluctuations .",
    "a useful image of the disk can be recovered by subtracting the image of the star , but the accuracy of this subtraction depends on how well both the psf and the stellar flux density are known .",
    "further smoothing of the image to increase the signal - to - noise may also prove useful .",
    "this section outlines the theoretical framework upon which later discussion of circumstellar disk structure ( such as how secular perturbations affect this structure ) is based .",
    "a disk is a dynamic entity , the constituent particles of which are undergoing constant dynamical and physical evolution ;  [ ssec - pp ] gives an extensive discussion of the physical processes acting on disk particles . ",
    "[ ssec - ddpc ] then summarizes our understanding of the dynamic disk by showing how disk particles can be categorized according to the dominant physical processes affecting their evolution .",
    "if we are to make generalizations about the physical processes relevant to circumstellar disk evolution , then the zodiacal cloud is the best example of a circumstellar disk on which to base this understanding , since its properties have been determined with a certain degree of confidence .",
    "this confidence stems from the wealth of observational , theoretical , and physical evidence describing its present state , its evolutionary history , and the physical environment of the system it is in .",
    "the physical processes that are described in this section are those thought to have dominated the evolution of the zodiacal cloud , supposedly since the sun reached the main sequence ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these processes should serve as an adequate basis for an understanding of the evolution of the circumstellar disks around other main sequence stars .",
    "there is , however , one obvious distinction between the zodiacal cloud and exosolar dust disks .",
    "the emission observed from the zodiacal cloud is dominated by that from dust in the inner solar system ( within 5 au of the sun ) , which has its origins in the asteroid belt ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the short period comets ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the emission observed from exosolar dust disks is dominated by that originating from dust in regions analogous to the kuiper belt in the solar system , i.e. , @xmath58 au from the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) . relatively little",
    "is known about the kuiper belt , but , like the inner solar system , it appears to be populated with many asteroid- or comet - like objects that are probably the remnants of the solar system s planetary formation phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dominant force acting on all but the smallest disk particles is the gravitational attraction of the star : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the gravitational constant , @xmath61 is the mass of the star , @xmath62 is the mass of the particle , and @xmath9 is the distance of the particle from the star .",
    "all material is assumed to orbit the star on keplerian ( elliptical ) orbits , with other forces acting as perturbations to these orbits .",
    "the orbit of a particle is defined by the following orbital elements : the semimajor axis , @xmath63 , and eccentricity , @xmath64 , that define the radial extent and shape of the orbit ; the inclination , @xmath65 , and longitude of ascending node , @xmath66 , that define the plane of the orbit ( relative to an arbitrary reference plane ) ; and the longitude of pericenter , @xmath67 , that defines the orientation of the orbit within the orbital plane ( relative to an arbitrary reference direction ) .",
    "the orbital period of the particle is given by : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given in years , @xmath70 au is the semimajor axis of the earth s orbit , and @xmath71 is the mass of the sun . at any instant ,",
    "the location of the particle in its orbit is defined by the true anomaly , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 at the pericenter and apocenter , respectively , and its distance from the star , @xmath9 , and its velocity , @xmath75 , are defined by : @xmath76    since at any given time a particle could be at any point along its orbit , its contribution to the distribution of material in a disk can be described by the elliptical ring that contains the mass of the particle spread out along its orbit , the line density of which varies inversely with the particle s velocity ( eq .  [ [ eq : vgrav ] ] ) .",
    "each disk particle has an orbit defined by a different set of orbital elements , with a contribution to the spatial distribution of material in the disk that can be described by a corresponding elliptical ring .",
    "thus , a disk s structure can be defined by the distribution of orbital elements of its constituent particles , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the number of disk particles with sizes in the range @xmath32 , and orbital elements in the range @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "a disk s orbital element distribution can be quantified in terms of the evolutionary history of the system and the physical processes acting on the disk s particles . using techniques such as those described in ",
    "[ sssec - simul ] , the resulting structure can then be compared with the disk s observable structure , @xmath81 , to link a disk observation with the physics of the particles in that disk .",
    "it is often convenient to discuss the dependence of the orbital element distribution on the different parameters separately ; e.g. , the distribution of semimajor axes , @xmath82 , is defined such that @xmath83 is the total number of particles with orbital semimajor axes in the range @xmath84 .",
    "a typical disk particle is created by the break - up of a larger `` parent '' body , either as the result of a collision with another body , or simply by its disintegration .",
    "this parent body could have been created by the break - up of an even larger body , and the particle itself will most likely end up as a parent body for particles smaller than itself .",
    "this `` collisional cascade '' spans the complete size range of disk material , and the particles that share a common ancestor are said to constitute a `` family '' of particles .",
    "the size distribution that results from this collisional cascade can be found from theoretical arguments ( @xcite ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 ; this distribution is expected to hold for disk particles that are large enough not to be affected by radiation forces (  [ sssec - rf ] ) .",
    "a disk with this distribution has its mass , @xmath87 , concentrated in its largest particles , while its cross - sectional area , @xmath88 , is concentrated in its smallest particles .",
    "collisions in such a disk are mostly non - catastrophic ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : dimp]]-[[eq : fcc ] ] ) , and a particle in this disk is most likely to be broken up by a particle that has just enough mass ( and hence energy ) to do so .",
    "this in turn means that collisional fragments have velocities , and hence orbital elements , that are almost identical to those of the original particle ; i.e. , in the absence of other forces , all members of the same family have identical orbits .",
    "due to the interaction of the competing physical processes , the size distribution of disk particles that are affected by radiation forces is only really understood qualitatively (   [ sssec - rf ] and [ sssec - pcsig ] ) ; their distribution is particularly important , since , in general , a disk s cross - sectional area ( and hence its observable structure ) is concentrated in these smaller particles .    the importance of collisions in determining a particle s evolution depends on its collisional lifetime , which is discussed in appendix [ app - tcoll ] .",
    "the collisional lifetime of the particles that constitute most of a disk s cross - sectional area ( i.e. , those that are expected to characterize the disk s mid - ir emission ,  [ ssec - los ] ) , can be approximated by ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : tcol5 ] ] and [ [ eq : fccdtyp ] ] ) : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the average orbital period of particles at @xmath9 ( eq .  [ [ eq : tper ] ] with @xmath63 replaced by @xmath9 ) , and @xmath91 is the disk s effective face - on optical depth ( eq .  [ [ eq : taueffdefn ] ] ) , which would be equal to the disk s true optical depth if its particles had unity extinction efficiency . the collisional lifetime of particles with @xmath92 can be considerably longer than that of equation ( [ eq : tcol6 ] ) ( see e.g. , eq .",
    "[ [ eq : tcol7 ] ] ) , and a disk s largest particles , those for which @xmath93 , may not have suffered any catastrophic collisions since they were first created ; such particles are primordial particles .",
    "the cascades of very young disks may still contain a significant proportion of primordial particles ; i.e. , their cascades may not be fully evolved .",
    "the collisional cascade theory is well - supported by evidence from the zodiacal cloud .",
    "the size distribution of the largest ( @xmath94 km ) members of the zodiacal cloud s collisional cascade , the observable asteroids , is well - approximated by equation ( [ eq : nd ] ) ( @xcite ; durda , greenberg , & jedicke 1998 ) ; the distribution of the very largest ( @xmath95 km ) asteroids deviates from this distribution , however , because of the transition from strength - scaling to gravity - scaling for asteroids larger than @xmath96 m ( @xcite ) .",
    "the size distribution of the zodiacal cloud s medium - sized ( 1 mm @xmath97 km ) members is also expected to follow equation ( [ eq : nd ] ) ( @xcite ) , but there is no observational proof of this , since these members are too faint to be seen individually , and too few to be studied collectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is , however , proof that the zodiacal cloud s collisional cascade extends from its largest members down to its smallest dust particles : the shapes of the `` dust band '' thermal emission features ( @xcite ) correspond to those expected from the small ( @xmath98 @xmath1 m ) particles resulting from the break - up , some time ago , of a few very large asteroids , the largest fragments of which are still observable as the asteroids in the themis , koronis , and , possibly , eos families ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the size distribution of the zodiacal cloud s smallest ( @xmath99 mm ) dust particles ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) can be explained qualitatively ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also  [ sssec - rf ] ) .",
    "analysis of the collision rates of objects in the kuiper belt ( @xcite ) shows that a collisional cascade should exist here too ; there is also evidence to suggest that the kuiper belt was once more massive than it is today ( @xcite ) , meaning that in the past collisions would have played a much larger role in determining its structure than they do today , maybe even causing the supposed mass loss ( @xcite ) .",
    "the size distribution of the observed kuiper belt objects appears to be slightly steeper than that in the inner solar system ( @xmath100 , @xcite ) , while observations have been unable , as yet , to determine its dust distribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ,      for most of the collisional cascade , gravity can be considered to be the only significant force acting on disk particles .",

    "an offset would be more observable in a disk such as hr 4796 due to its central cavity , since this causes a brightness asymmetry in the emission from the inner edge of the disk .",

    "while the modeling techniques used here are new to the study of circumstellar disks , they have already been widely used to study the observed structure of the zodiacal cloud ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and so can be used with a certain degree of confidence .",

    "the implications of this assumption are discussed in the interpretation of the model (  [ sec - disc ] ) .",
    "the quintessentially secular part of the distribution of the orbital elements of the large particles in a secularly perturbed disk is the distributions of their complex eccentricities , @xmath243 , and complex inclinations , @xmath244 . for a particle with an orbit of a given semimajor axis , @xmath63 , its complex eccentricity ,",

    "since it takes of the order of one precession timescale to distribute the complex eccentricities of collisional fragments around the circle centered on the forced eccentricity , the constraint on the planet s mass can be approximated as that for which is that the age of the system , @xmath437 , is greater than the secular timescale , @xmath438 ( eq .

    "the forced eccentricity imposed on the disk by the binary star is insignificant ( eq .",

    "we produced a model of the hr 4796 disk that accurately maps the 18.2 @xmath1 m brightness distribution observed by t99 ; this model is based on a consideration of the dynamics of the particles in the disk . the model shows how the brightness of a disk that has an inner clear region , that also has an offset center of symmetry caused by a forced eccentricity imposed on the disk particles orbits , would be asymmetric , since the inner edge of one side of the disk is closer to the star , and so is hotter and brighter , than the other side .",
    "we showed that a forced eccentricity as small as 0.02 is all that is necessary to cause a 5% lobe brightness asymmetry in the hr 4796 disk .",
    "if the eccentricity of orbit of the companion star , hr 4796b , is larger than 0.13 , then a forced eccentricity of 0.02 is to be expected .",
    "however , if there is a planet of mass @xmath462 located close to the inner edge of the disk , then the forced eccentricity , and hence the asymmetry , imposed on material in the disk s lobes is controlled by the planet rather than the binary companion ; this could also cause the disk to be warped .",
    "if a forced eccentricity is indeed the cause of the observed lobe asymmetry then observations that constrain the orbit of hr 4796b would help to clarify whether such a planet exists .",
    "if the hr 4796 system had no binary companion , a forced eccentricity of 0.02 could have been imposed on the disk by a lone planet with a mass of @xmath463 , and an eccentricity of @xmath464 .",
    "the statistical significance of the hr 4796 disk s lobe asymmetry in the observations of t99 is only at the @xmath465 level , however , it is also apparent in the observations of other authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it would take one good night on a 10 meter telescope to get a clear observation of the hr 4796 asymmetry .",
    "thus , the indirect detection of planets , even small planets , hiding in circumstellar disks is clearly within reach using these dynamic modeling techniques .",
    "this is particularly important , since the direct detection of planets around even nearby stars is well beyond current capabilities ( @xcite ) , and indirect detection techniques such as radial velocity ( @xcite ) or astrometric ( @xcite ) techniques , permit detection only of very massive planets that are close to the star .",
    "5 .   if there is a planet close to the inner edge of the disk , many of the disk s particles could be trapped in resonance with that planet , thus forming a resonant ring .",
    "such a ring would give the inner edge of the disk structure that rotates on the timescale of the orbital period of the planet , @xmath457 years . this structure",
    "could be contributing to the observed lobe asymmetry , and may also be present in the residuals of the observation .",
    "this possibility could be explored with further observations .",
    "resonant rings may be the predominantly observable structures of some exosolar systems , such as that recently observed around @xmath461 eridani ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hr 4796 disk modeling also revealed important information about the large - scale symmetrical structure of the disk , as well as about the dynamic properties of its emitting particles :    1 .",
    "the spatial distribution of material in the disk inferred from our modeling matches that inferred by other authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the surface density of cross - sectional area in the disk peaks at @xmath376 au from hr 4796a , falling off @xmath466 outside this radius , dropping by a factor of @xmath467 between 70 and 60 au , and falling to zero by 45 au .",
    "this soft inner edge to the disk is to be expected if the disk particles orbits are eccentric .",
    "2 .   assuming the particles to be astronomical silicate mie spheres , the diameter of the emitting particles was estimated to be @xmath336 @xmath1 m .",
    "particles this small have radiation forces that are characterized by @xmath468 , and so are blown out of the system on hyperbolic orbits on timescales of @xmath378 years .",
    "the hr 4796 disk is very dense ; the collisional lifetime of its emitting particles is @xmath469 years .",
    "thus , the emitting particles can not be primordial particles , rather they must be continuously created from a reservoir of larger particles .",
    "the collisional lifetimes of all of the disk s particles are shorter than their p - r drag lifetimes ; i.e. , none of the disk s particles are affected by p - r drag .",
    "further investigation of the particles properties needs to be done before any firm conclusions can be reached about whether the disk is dense enough to support a population of particles on hyperbolic orbits that is large enough to dominate the disk s emission . if the emitting particles are on hyperbolic orbits , the modeling implies a mass loss rate for the disk @xmath379year , and further modeling would have to be done to ascertain the spatial distribution of the dynamically stable population of large particles from which these emitting particles originated .",
    "consider a collision between two disk particles , the larger of which is denoted by the subscript 1 , and the smaller by the subscript 2 .",
    "for this collision to be `` catastrophic '' , that is , for it to result in the break - up of the larger particle , the impact energy of the collision must be large enough both to overcome the tensile strength of the larger particle , and to impart enough energy to the collisional fragments to overcome its gravitational binding energy . in the asteroid belt",
    "this limit means that a collision is only catastrophic if @xmath470 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the impact energy of a collision is @xmath471 , assuming that exosolar disk particles have similar tensile strengths to the solar system s asteroids , this limit can be scaled to exosolar disks by the square of the ratio of the mean relative velocity of collisions in the asteroid belt ( at @xmath164 au ) , @xmath472 km / s ( @xcite ) , to that of collisions in the exosolar disk .",
    "the mean relative velocity of collisions in exosolar disks can be described by : @xmath473 where @xmath474 is some function of the disk particles eccentricities and inclinations , and @xmath475 km / s is the average velocity of particles at @xmath9 ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : vgrav ] ] with @xmath63 replaced by @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath476 as for collisions in the asteroid belt , an exosolar disk particle of diameter @xmath477 , would only suffer a catastrophic collision if the other particle in the collision had a diameter @xmath478 , where @xmath479^{1/3}d .",

[ [ eq : dimp ] ] ) .    however , unless @xmath488 , the particle s orbit takes it through a range of @xmath33 and @xmath34 before a collision occurs ( there is also a variation of @xmath9 along the particle s orbit due to the eccentricity of its orbit ) .",
    "thus , it is more appropriate to calculate the particle s collisional lifetime using the mean catastrophic collision rate of the particles in the size range @xmath32 that are in the spherical shell of radius , @xmath9 , and width @xmath156 .",
    "consider an element of this shell that has a volume , @xmath489 .",

[ [ eq : tper ] ] with @xmath63 replaced by @xmath9 ) .",
    "a disk s effective optical depth , @xmath386 , can be estimated observationally from equation ( [ eq : brightness ] ) : @xmath506 where @xmath507 is the disk s face - on unsmoothed brightness .",
    "the disk s face - on unsmoothed brightness can be calculated either from the observed brightness , making corrections to account for both the disk s orientation , as well as for the psf smoothing , or from the disk s total flux density , @xmath508 , and assuming the disk material to be evenly distributed between @xmath509 : @xmath510 where @xmath511 au@xmath104/pc@xmath104/sr , and @xmath512 is the distance of the star from the observer .",
    "consider the particles in a disk that make up most of the disk s cross - sectional area , i.e. , those with diameters close to @xmath53 . by definition , these particles are most likely to collide with each other ( a collision that would definitely be catastrophic ) , and so their collisional lifetime can be found from equation ( [ eq : tcol3 ] ) using the approximation : @xmath513 applying this approximation to equation ( [ eq : tcol5 ] ) gives equation ( [ eq : tcol6 ] ) , which is also the collisional lifetime determined by artymowicz ( 1997 ) for particles in @xmath101 pictoris .",
    "the collisional lifetime of particles of different sizes in a disk differ only by the factor @xmath514 .",
    "this factor can be ascertained by making assumptions about the disk particles size distribution .",
    "assuming that the size distribution of equation ( [ eq : nd ] ) holds for disk particles between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the normalized cross - sectional area distribution is given by : @xmath515 substituting into equation ( [ eq : fcc ] ) gives : @xmath516 ,    \\label{eq : fcc2}\\ ] ] where @xmath517 for @xmath518 , and @xmath519 for @xmath520 ; the collisional lifetime of particles in a disk with this distribution is a minimum for particles for which @xmath521 .",
    "the size distribution of particles in a real disk is more complicated than equation ( [ eq : sigd ] ) , however , equation ( [ eq : fcc2 ] ) can be used to give a crude approximation for the collisional lifetime of a disk s large particles : @xmath522      if the p - r drag lifetime , @xmath145 ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : tpr ] ] ) , is comparable to , or shorter than @xmath173 , then the effect of p - r drag on the collisional lifetime must be accounted for ; e.g. , on average , particles from a parent at @xmath523 , survive until they reach @xmath524 where @xmath525 .",
    "also , if there is a significant change in @xmath9 along a particle s orbit due to the eccentricity of its orbit , a similar analysis can be done to take this into account when calculating its collisional lifetime . by considering the washer - like disk of particles on orbits with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and random @xmath67 ( @xcite ) :",
    "@xmath526dr]^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath527 is this disk s inner edge , and @xmath528 is its outer edge .",

    "[ [ eq : adot ] ] ) . while the solution given by equations ( [ eq : z ] ) and ( [ eq : y ] ) is no longer applicable , the decomposition of the particle s complex eccentricity and complex inclination into forced and proper elements , and the physical meaning of these elements , is still valid ; however , each of these elements now depends on the particle s dynamical history .",
    "consider the p - r drag affected particles created by the break - up of the asteroid family group described in ",
    "[ sssec - opsfam ] . immediately after they are created ,",
    "the orbital elements of these particles are the same as those of the rest of the family ; i.e. , they have semimajor axes @xmath63 , and complex eccentricities and complex inclinations that are uniformly distributed in these planes around circles of radii equal to the proper elements of the family , @xmath218 and @xmath220 . the dynamical evolution of a wave of these particles , i.e. , those that were created at the same time , can be followed by numerical integration to ascertain how the orbital elements of the particles in the wave vary as their semimajor axes decrease due to p - r drag ; this is the `` particles in a circle '' method ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was found that the complex eccentricities and complex inclinations of a wave of particles originating in the asteroid belt remain on circles , and that as the wave s semimajor axis , @xmath531 , decreases : its effective proper eccentricity ( the radius of the wave s circle in the complex eccentricity plane ) decreases @xmath532 ; its effective proper inclination ( the radius of the wave s circle in the complex inclination plane ) remains constant at @xmath220 ; the distributions of the particles @xmath251 and @xmath265 remain random ; while its effective forced elements ( the centers of the circles in the complex eccentricity and complex inclination planes ) have a more complicated variation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the orbital element distributions , @xmath243 and @xmath244 , of p - r drag affected particles are like that of the large particles , in that they are the addition of @xmath222 and @xmath223 to symmetrical proper element distributions ; however , their forced and proper elements are different for particles from different families , as well as being different for particles of different sizes and with different orbital semimajor axes .",
    "this means that their spatial distribution is subject to offset and warp secular perturbation asymmetries .      for disks in which p - r drag",
    "is a significant physical process , the existence of an inner hole implies not only that there must be no large particles in the inner region , but also that there must be some mechanism that prevents the particles that are in the outer disk from evolving into the inner disk by p - r drag . in hr 4796 , and other disks in which p - r drag",
    "is insignificant , this mechanism is collisions ; i.e. , particles created in the outer disk are broken up by collisions before they reach the inner region .",
    "this section presents dynamical explanations of how a planet located at the inner edge of the disk would help to prevent the emitting particles from reaching the inner disk .",
    "this is not just important for disks in which its individual particles are not affected significantly by p - r drag in their lifetime , since while the inner edge of a disk s largest particles may be at @xmath288 , the cumulative effect of p - r drag on all of the stages of the collisional cascade that a primordial particle goes through before the fragments are small enough to be blown out of the system by radiation pressure could mean that the inner edge of these blow - out particles is further in than @xmath288 . to assess whether the cumulative effect of p - r drag has an impact on the inner edge of the emitting particles in the hr 4796 disk ,",
    "consider its size distribution to follow that assumed in equation ( [ eq : sigd ] ) , where @xmath533 @xmath1 m , and @xmath161 .",

    "one consequence of a planet at the inner edge of the disk is that it accretes some of the particles that pass it on their way into the inner region .",
    "a simple estimate for the proportion of particles lost in such a way can be obtained by considering the p - r drag evolution of a torus of particles with orbital elements @xmath63 ,",

    "thus , the proportion of dust accreted onto the planet , @xmath543 , is given by : @xmath544 where @xmath545 kg / m@xmath113 is the mean density of jupiter , @xmath546^{-1}$ ] , and @xmath75 is the velocity of the particle ; e.g. , if @xmath547 , then a jupiter - like planet at the inner edge of the disk would need @xmath548 to accrete all of the particles passing it ( i.e. , @xmath549 for @xmath134 ) .",
    "another consequence of a planet at the inner edge of the disk is that it traps some of the disk particles into its exterior mean motion resonances .",
    "the resulting resonant ring has three consequences that may aid with the formation of a clear inner region .",
    "firstly , the calculation of the probability of accretion onto the planet given in equation ( [ eq : paccrn ] ) does not apply to the particles that are trapped in the ring .",
    "it is thought that resonance trapping helps the accretion process , since trapped particles may leave the resonance upon a close encounter with the planet ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the constraint on the mass of the planet derived in the last paragraph is an upper limit for the accretion process to be the sole removal mechanism .",
    "secondly , the ring increases the number of particles that are lost by collisional break - up , since it both decreases the collisional lifetime of disk particles ( by increasing the number density of particles in the ring region ) and increases the amount of time it takes for particles that are trapped in the ring to reach the inner region .",
    "finally , if the trapping timescales , @xmath550 , are longer than the age of the system , @xmath437 , then the trapped particles can not have reached the inner disk yet ; i.e. , the ring causes a bottle - neck in the flow of particles to the inner disk .",

    "<S> recent images of the disks of dust around the young stars hr 4796a ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and fomalhaut ( @xcite ) show , in each case , a double - lobed feature that may be asymmetric ( one lobe may be brighter than the other ) . </S>",
    "<S> a symmetric double - lobed structure is that expected from a disk of dust with a central hole that is observed nearly edge - on ( i.e. , close to the plane of the disk ) . </S>",
    "<S> this paper shows how the gravitational influence of a second body in the system with an eccentric orbit would cause a brightness asymmetry in such a disk by imposing a `` forced eccentricity '' on the orbits of the constituent dust particles , thus shifting the center of symmetry of the disk away from the star and causing the dust near the forced pericenter of the perturbed disk to glow . </S>",
    "<S> dynamic modeling of the hr 4796 disk shows that its @xmath0% brightness asymmetry could be the result of a forced eccentricity as small as 0.02 imposed on the disk by either the binary companion hr 4796b , or by an unseen planet close to the inner edge of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> since it is likely that a forced eccentricity of 0.01 or higher would be imposed on a disk in a system in which there are planets , but no binary companion , the corresponding asymmetry in the disk s structure could serve as a sensitive indicator of these planets that might otherwise remain undetected . </S>"
