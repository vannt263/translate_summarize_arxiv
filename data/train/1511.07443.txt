    "core - collapse supernovae mark the end stage of stellar evolution for massive stars .",
    "these explosions are initiated in the cores of stars with zero - age main sequence masses above 8 - 10@xmath1 , where hydrostatic burning of progressively heavier and heavier elements culminates in the formation of a degenerate and inert iron core with a mass of at least @xmath01.2@xmath1 .",
    "the stability of this iron core against gravitational collapse is due to electron degeneracy pressure .",
    "however , once the iron core grows beyond the effective chandrasekhar mass , which can vary depending on the central entropy and electron fraction @xcite , the core begins to collapse .",
    "the collapse is halted when the matter reaches nuclear density at which point the repulsive core of the strong nuclear force can supply enough pressure to stabilize the material once again .",
    "the inertia of the collapsing inner core causes it to overshoot the new hydrostatic equilibrium , the rebounding of the core is responsible for launching a shock wave into the still - collapsing outer mantle of the iron core . for a successful core - collapse supernova , this shock will ultimately unbind most of the mass of star and help spread the nucleosynthetic products of stellar evolution throughout the host galaxy .",
    "however , the shock expansion is hampered by two main sinks of energy .",
    "first , the dissociation of the heavy nuclei into neutron and protons as they pass through the shock gives an inefficient conversion of the kinetic energy of the infalling material into thermal energy behind the shock as a modest fraction must go into the internal energy of the matter .",
    "second , the temperature behind the shock , and the abundance of free protons now available for electron capture , facilitate energy loss via neutrino emission .",
    "this also removes thermal energy from behind the shock . both of these processes reduce the thermal pressure behind the shock and bring it into equilibrium with the ram pressure of the infalling matter",
    "this causes the shock to stall and become an accretion shock .",
    "the goal of core - collapse supernova theory over the last @xmath050 years has been to understand the shock revival mechanism .",
    "the most ubiquitous mechanism has been the neutrino heating mechanism @xcite .",
    "neutrino heating is always found in core collapse simulations .",
    "the intense neutrino radiation field streaming away from the protoneutron star ( pns ) quickly falls out of equilibrium with the matter near the neutrinosphere . outside this radius",
    "there are lingering charged - current interactions of electron type neutrinos and antineutrinos on matter where a net positive transfer of energy between the neutrinos and the matter occurs .",
    "if this energy transfer is sufficient , it can lead to shock expansion and a successful explosion . in",
    "spherically symmetric simulations of the collapse of typical iron cores , the amount of neutrino heating is not sufficient to drive an explosion @xcite .",
    "explosions in two and three dimensional models with energy - dependent neutrino transport have been reported over the last @xmath05 years @xcite , however in this set of successful explosions there are large discrepancies amongst the results from different codes for otherwise very similar initial conditions and input physics .",
    "many of the earliest simulations of core - collapse supernova used or were concerned with a general relativistic ( gr ) approach @xcite , and rightly so since neutron stars are sufficiently compact that gr dramatically effects their equilibrium structure . while the importance of including gr gravity in simulations core - collapse supernovae has always persisted in the literature and is in use in many current and state - of - the - art multidimensional , core - collapse supernova calculations @xcite , many modern simulations use a purely newtonian approximation for gravity @xcite . @xcite",
    "extensively compared gr gravity and newtonian gravity in spherical symmetry with a full boltzmann neutrino transport solver .",
    "while their baseline simulations in both prescriptions of gravity fail to explode in 1d , their conclusion is that , overall , gr is helpful for the development of the core - collapse supernova explosion .",
    "this conclusion comes out of serendipitous simulations where incorrect nucleon isoenergetic scattering cross sections were used . in these simulations , when gr gravity was used , the simulation predicted an explosion , but when newtonian gravity was used , the simulations failed to achieve explosions . @xcite and @xcite also compared newtonian and gr simulations in spherical symmetry with energy dependent neutrino transport .",
    "like @xcite , they observe higher neutrino luminosities and energies but do not extensively study the differences , in part because both simulations still fail to explode owing to the 1d nature of the simulations . @xcite examined the difference between special relativistic hydrodynamics and gr hydrodynamics in both 1d and 3d core - collapse simulations using approximate neutrino transport ( a grey m1 scheme ) .",
    "however , while the 3d gr simulations show signs of increased susceptibility to explosion , the simulated time was not long enough to observe an explosion .",
    "@xcite also investigated the influence of newtonian gravity , gr gravity , and gr effective potential gravity in 2d core collapse simulations using a variable eddington factor , two - moment , energy dependent neutrino transport scheme and the ray - by - ray+ approximation ( where the neutrino transport is done along radial rays assuming spherical symmetry and with minimal coupling between neighboring rays ) .",
    "for the classic 15@xmath1 model from @xcite , @xcite find a late and asymmetric explosion when using fully gr gravity , but not with newtonian gravity , gr effective potential gravity , or with reduced set neutrino opacities .",
    "this was , and still is , the most direct evidence that gr aids in the explosion mechanism .",
    "it is important to validate the hypothesis that gr gravity does indeed lead to more favorable conditions for explosion in modern day simulations , with updated progenitor models , and loosening the spherically symmetric assumption .",
    "a number of two - dimensional simulations with similar initial conditions have been performed by several different groups using various different treatments of energy - dependent neutrino transport .",
    "the initial conditions , chosen by @xcite , consists of four models from @xcite with zero - age main sequence masses of 12@xmath1 , 15@xmath1 , 20@xmath1 , and 25@xmath1 .",
    "they employ the eos of @xcite with incompressibility parameter @xmath2 mev ( hereafter , ls220 ) .",
    "simulations of these four models , and the same eos were also presented by @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite use newtonian hydrodynamics with a gr effective potential ( * ? ? ?",
    "* case a ) .",
    "@xcite also simulate core collapse in these progenitors , however they use the @xcite eos and assume purely newtonian gravity .",
    "@xcite simulate three of the four models , use the ls220 eos , and newtonian gravity .",
    "more details about these simulations can be found in and the various references .",
    "while no collaborative comparison has been done for these simulations , they do represent the largest set of recent multidimensional core - collapse supernova models performed by multiple simulation codes . in",
    ", we include the outcome of these simulations ( explosion / no explosion ) as well as the time of explosion for successful models , we divide the results into simulations with a gr treatment of gravity , and with a newtonian treatment of gravity .",
    "the results are quite disparate .",
    "@xcite find early and energetic explosions in all four simulated models while @xcite finds explosions in all models , but some explosions are quite delayed ( up to @xmath0500ms later than @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite conclude that the final explosion energies will be significantly lower than @xcite .",
    "for the simulations with newtonian gravity , @xcite find no explosions and @xcite finds an explosion in one model , the 12@xmath1 progenitor .    in this paper , we perform core collapse simulations for this same set of progenitors and employ the ls220 eos @xcite .",
    "we use a new multidimensional neutrino transport implementation in the ` flash ` hydrodynamics simulation package @xcite .",
    "we also systematically explore the differences between core collapse simulations with newtonian gravity and with a newly implemented gr effective potential .",
    "we include our results in .",
    "our main conclusion is that a gr treatment of gravity is important and required for accurately simulating the neutrino mechanism in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the assumption of newtonian gravity underestimates the neutrino luminosity and the mean energies of the emitted spectra , consequently , newtonian gravity results in lower neutrino heating rates in the gain region .",
    "given the large number of simulation groups currently using newtonian gravity to study core - collapse supernovae , we find it especially important to systematically demonstrate this point .",
    "we also compare our results to other core - collapse supernova simulations with comparable initial conditions . in some cases we find close agreement with these other studies , particularly with the results of the @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in",
    ", we introduce the methods used for computing the gr effective potential and for our neutrino transport scheme .",
    "several tests of these methods are presented in the appendix . in we present our main results including a detailed comparison to publicly available simulation data from @xcite and @xcite , multidimensional results assuming newtonian gravity , and multidimensional results using gr effective potential gravity .",

    "the differences in the neutrino heating quantities are relatively large .",
    "the heating quantities are non - linear in the sense that an increased neutrino luminosity or mean squared energy not only increases the specific heating rate , but also increases the size of the region that undergoes net heating .",

    "_ shock evolution : _ the evolution of the mean shock radius is also qualitatively similar .",
    "the initial stalling radius in our simulations is @xmath0155 km compared to @xmath0160 km in @xcite .",
    "after this , there is a period of shock recession before the ultimate shock expansion .",
    "however , the simulations of @xcite have a much more pronounced shock recession .",
    "this may stem from the differences in the neutrino interactions used .",
    "@xcite use inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering and absorption opacities from @xcite whereas we use simpler elastic rates from @xcite .",
    "they use microphysical electron capture rates on heavy nuclei for the collapse phase instead of the approximate form from @xcite implemented here . finally , @xcite include neutrino - neutrino pair scattering and annihilation ( to other neutrino pairs ) as additional pair - processes . one important consequence of these improved opacities is the more efficient cooling of the pns which gives higher @xmath105 luminosities and faster contraction and as a consequence .    _ convective motions : _ a potentially important difference between our simulation results and the simulations of @xcite is the evolution of the non - radial kinetic energies in the gain region which is indicative of increased convective activity .",
    "our 2d simulations , both grep and newtonian , have @xmath141erg of lateral kinetic energy in the gain region at @xmath0150 - 250ms after bounce ( see ) , roughly twice the value observed for a different set of progenitors in @xcite .",
    "this may be a consequence of our cylindrical grid which imposes non - spherical perturbations ( i.e. convective seeds ) on our fluid flow .",
    "this sign of stronger convective motions behind the shock could be bringing our simulations closer to explosion @xcite .",
    "additionally , since we ignore the red - shifting of the neutrino energy spectrum as it climbs out of the gravitational well , our heating is overestimated ( see ) .",
    "this could also give stronger neutrino - driven convection and larger non - radial kinetic energies .",

    "this approximation has not been rigorously tested for dynamical simulations ( although see @xcite for a hydrostatic comparison of ray - by - ray to truly multidimensional transport ) which requires holding everything else fixed to eliminate other sources of differences such as numerical methods , initial conditions , input physics , etc .",
    "given these lingering differences between our simulations and those of @xcite , a comparison with even closer underlying physics is warranted .",

    "s15 , s20 , and s25 .",
    "the success of these models in our simulations is not due solely to the increase in neutrino heating as a result of multidimensional instabilities , rather the instabilities themselves are directly contributing to success of the explosion @xcite . our results ,",
    "while only consisting of four models , are inconsistent with the 1d parameterized model predictions of success / failure from @xcite : our exploding models are predicted to fail and our failed model is predicted to succeed .",
    "the ultimate predictive power of 1d parameterized explosion models like these must be further tested ( or calibrated ) with multidimensional models .",
    "the study of core - collapse supernovae is an exceedingly multi - physics problem .",
    "if anything , decades of research into the core - collapse supernova central engine has shown that in order to create realistic simulations of these astrophysical phenomena we need to include all of the important underlying physics .",
    "this includes , but is of course not limited to , the nuclear equation of state , neutrino transport and neutrino interactions , general relativistic gravity , realistic progenitor models , resolved multidimensional ( 3d ) magnetohydrodynamics , and more . in this paper",
    "we have extended the capabilities of the ` flash ` simulation package to now include an effective treatment of general relativistic gravity and a multispecies , multigroup , multidimensional neutrino radiation transport solver .",
    "both of these new implementations are designed for application to the core - collapse supernova problem .",
    "we have tested our gr implementation of gravity and our neutrino transport solver with several classic test problems , including an unstable tov migration test ( in both 1d and 2d ) , and the m1 shadow test .",
    "furthermore , we perform the benchmark core - collapse test case for gr neutrino radiation transport + hydrodynamics from @xcite which uses a base set of neutrino interactions based on @xcite , the ls180 nuclear eos from @xcite , and the 15@xmath1 progenitor from @xcite . our results closely match those of other neutrino transport methods .",
    "we critically assess and make clear the impact of the approximations in our neutrino transport scheme with this comparison .    extending our simulations to axisymmetry , we study core collapse in four progenitors from @xcite with both newtonian and gr gravity for at least @xmath0600ms after bounce . while the benefits that a general relativistic treatment of gravity can have for the core - collapse supernova problem have been discussed before ,",
    "ours is the first study to systematically explore the differences between newtonian and gr gravity in multiple dimensions and across several updated progenitor models .",
    "our results clearly and unambiguously show that gr gravity significantly aids the neutrino mechanism in reenergizing the stalled supernova shock formed in the core collapse of massive stars .",
    "we obtain explosions in three of four progenitor models from @xcite when using general relativistic gravity , while all four models fail to explode when using newtonian gravity . consistently in the literature are complicated multi - physics simulations of core - collapse supernova with sophisticated neutrino treatments but newtonian gravity .",
    "the results presented here show that the approximation of newtonian gravity can be quite detrimental in the context of core - collapse supernova explosions and should be relaxed if accurate results are sought .",
    "our results match , in several ways , other multidimensional , energy - dependent neutrino radiation transport simulations of core - collapse supernovae including the newtonian gravity simulations of @xcite and the gr gravity simulations of @xcite .",
    "however , differences still exist between the results of these works and the work present here",
    ". this could be due to differences in the neutrino and nuclear microphysics , neutrino transport methods , and/or numerical setups .",
    "we find qualitative differences between our work and the work of @xcite , which again , could be due to any of potential differences listed above .",
    "however , we particularly note significant differences in the amount of the neutrino heating present during the early postbounce phase . a close comparison of methods , input physics , and results is warranted to resolve these differences .",

    "in , we test our gr effective potential implementation via a tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) star migration test . we follow the initial conditions from @xcite .",
    "our unstable tov stars follow a @xmath145 polytropic eos , @xmath146 with a value of @xmath147 [ cgs ] .",
    "we take an initial central density of @xmath148g@xmath123 and solve the ` case a ' modified tov equations to obtain the equilibrium ( but unstable ) structure . with simulate 4ms of evolution in ` flash ` , in both 1d ( red dashed line ) and 2d ( blue dashed - dotted ) .",
    "we also use the full gr code ` gr1d ` to perform the migration test ( black solid line ) , for this full gr test , we use the standard tov equations to construct the initial profile . in the effective potential tests ,",
    "the unstable star quickly ( @xmath00.1ms ) starts its migration away from the unstable configuration , and oscillates about the stable configuration .",
    "the full gr evolution is slower , especially at the beginning , which we can understand from the time dilation effect in the full gr simulation , the value of the central lapse for this configuration begins at @xmath00.27 , and migrates to @xmath00.65 .",
    "our results compare very well to the ` case a ' results and the full gr ` coconut ` results of @xcite , completing between 7 and 8 oscillation cycles in the first 4ms of evolution for the effective potentials and @xmath05 cycles in the full gr case .",
    "this convinces us that we have correctly implemented the gr effective potential in both 1d and 2d in ` flash ` .",

    "in one - moment transport schemes , like flux - limited diffusion , the flux of energy density is taken to be in the direction of the spatial gradient of the neutrino energy density .",
    "this works well in the diffusion limit , but in a free streaming regime this assumption works to artificially source neutrino momentum and wash out potentially physical gradients .",
    "one of the advantages of a m1-like transport scheme is the ability to maintain the momentum of free streaming neutrinos .",
    "the classic test problem to demonstrate this ability of m1 transport is the shadow test .",
    "we closely follow the 2d shadow test proposed in @xcite , with the exception that we employ axisymmetry and use cylindrical coordinates whereas @xcite perform their shadow test in genuine 2d cartesian coordinates , apart from a geometric factor of @xmath150 , these setups are identical . at the origin , within a spherical radius of @xmath151 , we have a spherical emission source with an absorption opacity of @xmath152}\\,,\\ ] ] and an emissivity with an arbitrary normalization . along the radial direction , a distance of 8 from the central source , we place a purely absorbing ( @xmath153 ) circle ( which corresponds to a torus under axisymmetry ) with radius of 2 .",
    "the grid extends to + 12 in the radial direction and @xmath1545 along the symmetry axis .",
    "the grid resolution is 0.05 . for this test we do not use any mesh refinement , a side effect of this",
    "is that we have free streaming radiation on the finest resolution of our grid , our first order method for the explicit flux calculation does poorly unless we lower the cfl factor from 0.4 to 0.2 , which we do for this test .",
    "we do not encounter this issue with our core collapse simulations because of our mesh refinement , the neutrino radiation is not close to the free streaming limit until @xmath155 km , by that radius we have decreased our grid resolution , giving small effective cfl factors in these outer zones .    in , we show the radiation transport solution for the neutrino energy density . to achieve a constant value in the free streaming regime",
    "we scale the energy density by @xmath156 .",
    "we normalize the data to range between 0 and 1 .",
    "we show the solution after several light crossing times of the domain . the shadow cast by the absorbing torus",
    "is clearly seen and demonstrates this ability of our code to maintain the neutrino momentum direction .",
