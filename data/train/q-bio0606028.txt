    "nonlinear models supporting coherent excitations appear in many fields of science since the pioneering discoveries by fermi , pasta and ulam @xcite more than 50 years ago .",
    "the success of this approach in modeling complex systems has encouraged its application in other fields .",
    "that is the case of biology , where nonlinear models were widely applied in many subjects , such as in the study of the dna molecule ( see , for example , @xcite ) . to realize the relevance of these models",
    "it should be noticed that , nowadays , the computational cost of molecular dynamics for realistic models of dna molecules with a few tens of base pairs allows simulation times up to tens of nanoseconds at most .",
    "nonlinear models allow the study of such a complex system with very many degrees of freedom by reducing drastically this amount up to one degree of freedom per base pair , the most relevant for the process under study .",
    "it goes without saying that the reduction of a very complicated object such as the dna duplex to a polymer formed by base pairs , each one with just one degree of freedom ( sometimes a few more ) helps enormously the theoretical and computational study of this models . nevertheless ,",
    "although simplified , these models can yield important results .",
    "an example of these models is the peyrard - bishop model of dna @xcite , which achieved an important goal when describing the denaturation process of dna in terms of just the radial distance of the bases on each base pair @xcite .    among all these approaches we focus here on the work of englander _ et al . _",

    ", they based their hypothesis on experimental results that showed unexpectedly long lifetimes of open states of dna duplexes @xcite . in spite of the fact that , later , guron _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found more reasonable lifetimes , smaller by one or two orders of magnitude than the ones reported in previous works , a vast amount of literature is still based on englander model . in this context , the aim of this work is to analyze in depth part of the literature related to the work of englander _ et al .",
    "_ , providing new results that give insight into a number of important questions .",
    "specifically , we will study the relation between the dynamics of sg solitons and the position of promoters in the genome of the bacteriophage t7 .",
    "this line of work began with salerno @xcite at the beginning of the 90 s and was subsequently continued in several works @xcite .",
    "we stress that this is a very important issue : indeed , if the englander model behaviour could be connected to functionally relevant positions in the sequence , it would provide a cheap and efficient tool for genomics .",
    "although claims in this direction have been recently presented @xcite , the main result of the present work is that , unfortunately , such a connection can not be substantiated .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : salerno ] we discuss the methodology and the results of the two first papers about this issue @xcite in terms of the effective potential introduced by salerno in collaboration with kivshar in @xcite . in section [ sec : t7 ]",
    "we describe the main features of the promoters of the t7 genome , and analyze the simulation results of the work of lennholm and hrnquist @xcite in terms of the effective potential . in section",
    "[ sec : breathers ] we discuss recent work about breathers in the sg model @xcite .",
    "finally , section [ sec : con ] concludes the paper by summarizing our main results and their implications .",
    "more than a quarter of a century ago , englander and coworkers @xcite introduced solitonic excitations into the dna world as an initial step towards understanding the stability of open segments of dna molecules @xcite .",
    "they suggested the well - known sg model , that describes the dynamics of a line of pendula in a vertical gravitational field with torsional spring coupling between units , as an effective description of dna molecules . in this way",
    ", the double - helix is approximated by two parallel rods on which pendula ( base pairs ) are attached , and bonding to the opposite base is represented by a `` gravitational '' potential of each pendulum .",
    "calling @xmath4 the twist angle of the @xmath5-th base , this model has static soliton ( kink ) solutions given by @xmath6 valid for @xmath7 , where the continuum approximation applies . in equation ( [ eq : kink ] ) ,",
    "@xmath8 is a dimensionless parameter representing the parameters of the model , and acts as an effective discretization parameter of the continuum sg problem . in spite of such a great oversimplification of the real problem ,",
    "the model contained the main feature of breaking a bond around @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to this , the results were consistent with available data @xcite although englander _ et al .",
    "_ were aware of the lack of evidences of solitonic excitations .",
    "salerno , in his pioneering and interesting work @xcite , tried to find a relation between relevant sites in the @xmath0 genome and the dynamics of sg kinks moving along the inhomogenous dna sequence under study .",
    "the main difference with respect to previous works was the introduction of the inhomogeneity of the sequence in the model .",
    "to do so , he took the static kink solution ( [ eq : kink ] ) , with center at @xmath10 , and used it as initial condition of the equations of motion of the discrete , _ inhomogeneous _ sg ( or englander ) model , @xmath11 @xmath12 being the parameter that carries all the information of the sequence under study .",
    "it is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the torsional spring constant between consecutive bases , @xmath15 is the energy of a hydrogen bond and @xmath16 is the number of hydrogen bonds in a base pair , which is @xmath17 for @xmath18 base pairs and",
    "@xmath19 for @xmath20 base pairs . considered as a discrete version of the continuum sg equation ,",
    "the effective discretization of the lattice used in @xcite was @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 being the number of bases of the sequence ) . this value is around @xmath24 , which is small enough to avoid spurious discretization effects when numerically integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion ] ) .",
    "in fact , taking eq .",
    "( [ eq : kink ] ) as an _ ansatz _ in eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion ] ) was a good choice , as the kink is a very robust object even in inhomogeneous sequences and its center can be well defined by interpolating the position where @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "once the model was defined , salerno built a sequence @xmath26 to introduce it in ( [ eq : motion ] ) .",
    "he was interested in the genomic sequence of the @xmath0 @xmath1 promoter but , instead of using the original dna sequence , he built a `` synthetic '' one from the original .",
    "we will review all the details of this process as this will be the key to understand the results of @xcite .",
    "he took a sequence @xmath27 of 168 bases containing the so - called @xmath1 promoter ( further details on @xmath0 promoters will be given in the next section ) which corresponds to base pairs ( bp ) from 378 to 545 of the actual @xmath0 genomic sequence , and built a longer sequence of 1000 bases , that we will call @xmath28 , to prevent the influence of boundary conditions on the dynamics of kinks : @xmath29 in this way , the 168 bases sequence @xmath27 would remain in the center of the new sequence @xmath28 , with the transcription start site located in bp 526 and the promoter sequence going from bp 509 to bp 531 , far from the limits of the lattice . therefore , reflective boundary conditions could be safely used in the numerical simulations .",
    "we will return to this issue when discussing the results .    as was known that the rna polymerase could bind to dna in the region of @xmath27 going from bp 51 to bp 140 ( going from bp 455 to bp 545 in @xmath28 ) , the expectation was that this region should be dynamically active .",
    "hence , in @xcite several integrations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion ] ) were carried out with the initial position of the static kink in a variety of sites inside the promoter region and the behaviour of the kinks was studied as a function of their starting position .",
    "the results were the following : for initial positions in @xmath28 from bp 415 to bp 505 the kink remained static or with small oscillations around the starting point . for bp 510 ,",
    "the kink acquired a velocity @xmath30 towards the left , was reflected without loss of energy at the left boundary and reflected again at the promoter region with velocity @xmath30 .",
    "this behaviour was enhanced when the initial position was increased from bp 510 to bp 535 , where the kink also reached the maximum velocity @xmath31 . beyond this point",
    "this dynamical behaviour was drastically reduced . for bp 540",
    "the kink acquired a small velocity ( @xmath32 ) towards the right , and for bp 555 the kink simply remained at rest .",
    "the dynamics of a kink with initial velocity @xmath31 towards the left was also studied , starting from bp 900 ; it was found that the soliton was accelerated when it traveled from right to left through the central region , then reflected at the left end of the sequence and decelerated when traveled in the opposite direction .",
    "it was concluded in @xcite that these results showed the existence of a dynamically `` active '' region going from bp 510 to bp 540 inside the @xmath0 @xmath1 promoter that could explain the functioning of dna promoters as energetic activators of the rna polymerase transport process .    in a subsequent paper , salerno and kivshar",
    "@xcite introduced the effective potential in order to explain the behaviour of these objects when moving in a inhomogenous sequence .",
    "the idea is that kink robustness allows to approximate their dynamics , even though they are extended objects , as if they were point - like particules moving along a one - dimensional potential , given by @xmath33 recently this approach has been shown to give good results for fibonacci @xcite and dna sequences other than the @xmath0 one @xcite . by `` good results '' we mean that the dynamics of the kink in eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion ] ) and that of the particle in the effective potential ( [ eq : poteff ] ) can by aligned , in the sense that trajectories are semiquantitatively similar , equilibrium points for the kink correspond to minima of the potential , and so on .",
    "this was also the case with the effective potential introduced in @xcite : this paper reported the agreement of the direction of motion of the kinks according to the effective potential curve corresponding to the sequence @xmath28 , plotted from bp 425 to bp 605 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : salerno ] ) .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , there is indeed a good correspondence between the effective potential and the simulation results summarized above .",

    "we immediately observe , on the one hand , that the positions of the peaks and the wells of the effective potential of sequence @xmath28 explain very well the above kink dynamics results reported in @xcite in terms of a point - like particle ; and , on the other hand , that the effective potential of the original @xmath0 genome _",
    "far from the @xmath1 promoter _ is very different from the one of the @xmath28 sequence , and hence the dynamics of kinks must be different , too .",
    "[ fig : a1]b shows the dynamics of two kinks on the two sequences , @xmath28 and the original @xmath0 sequence .",
    "it is clear that the dynamics behaviour of both sequences is largely different : for instance , in the true potential bp 510 should not be regarded as an active site whereas bp 680 should be regarded so .",
    "the comparison of the trajectories with those obtained from the effective potential confirms the validity of this potential to describe the dynamics of kinks ( allowing for a difference in time scales , as in the point - like particle description time units are arbitrary ) .",

    "however , we have just shown how important they are when the kink moves towards them .",
    "therefore , we are forced to conclude that the results in @xcite are highly dependent on the construction of sequences @xmath28 , and that when the original @xmath0 genome sequence is used instead then the promoter regions can not be considered `` active '' or `` special '' regions anymore .",
    "as we have seen , other regions close to , but different from , the promoters may be even more `` active '' in the sense of inducing kink motion ; conversely , some active regions in the synthetic sequence lose this character in the real genome .",
    "following the interesting proposal of salerno , namely the putative relation between @xmath0 promoters and the dynamics of solitons moving along inhomogeneous genomic sequences , further research intended to shed further light on this question @xcite .",

    "measured the maximum distance ( in either direction ) reached by initially static kinks starting from each of the sites of the whole sequence of the @xmath0 genome .",
    "they also took the 24 promoters of the @xmath0 genome ( except the first and the last ones to avoid boundary effects ) , studied the results obtained for positions going from -4 to -1 of each promoter and compared these results with the results of the whole genome .",
    "the aim of this analysis was to find whether the rna polymerase melting region ( the one going from -4 to -1 in each promoter ) acts as a dynamically `` active '' region as proposed by salerno , or behaves in the same way as the rest of the nucleotides of the genome . in this respect , they did not found relevant differences ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , for every promoter they investigated the activity of the first @xmath49 base pairs which are transcribed by rna polymerase and found that , for @xmath50 , the studied regions are more active than average with a significance of more than five standard deviations ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "they did not give any biological interpretation of that results but , in their conclusions , they suggested that a more quantitative relation between kink motion and the effective potential should be established .",
    "as already mentioned , this paper as well as our previous work @xcite has proven the agreement between kink dynamics and effective potential .",

    ", we will review some of the properties of the @xmath0 promoters in order to set a methodology in the study of the effective potential in these regions .",
    "the @xmath0 phage genome is one of the most studied genomes since the whole genome sequence was found in 1983 @xcite , and few changes in the sequence have been reported since then @xcite .",
    "the reproductive cycle of the @xmath0 phage is closely linked to the promoter and gene distribution in the genome . when the @xmath0 rna is injected inside a bacteria , like _",

    "( [ eq : poteff ] ) ] is just a weighted average of the sequence around the site , with weight function @xmath67 .",
    "we can obtain an estimation of the resolution of the effective potential reading frame by noticing that an error of about 10% in the effective potential is introduced when truncating the sum in the weighted average ( [ eq : poteff ] ) in @xmath68 around each @xmath49 . if we consider that , for further sites , the contribution of the @xmath69 to the weighted average is negligible , then the number of sites averaged when computing the effective potential on each site goes as @xmath70 .",
    "this means that , for @xmath24 ( which is the approximate value of the discretization as explained in section [ sec : salerno ] ) , @xmath71 is about 40 , a much lower resolution than the one needed to recognize the 23 base - pair consensus sequence in the effective potential .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the kink is too wide to allow us to check that the same curve describes the effective potential of different promoters , as was suggested in @xcite . on the other hand , we can increase the resolution of the effective potential by increasing the discretization @xmath8 until reaching @xmath72 .",
    "we could find then the consensus sequence repeated in the effective potential around each promoter , but that would not give more information than the consensus sequence itself , and the effective potential would not be useful from a genomic point of view .    to go beyond the previous theoretical discussion ,",

    "clearly there is no `` consensus effective potential '' that appears in all ( neither in most ) of the promoters .",
    "if we were looking for more subtle properties that might enclose all the 18 promoters or each subset of early and late promoters , then we would be led to consider as promoters other regions of the @xmath0 genome which are not . as an example , the effective potentials around some other regions that are not promoters are plotted in fig .

    "a graph with the furthest position reached in the sequence in terms of the initial position from which the kink started to move would have yielded different results from the ones reported in @xcite and the work would have been more conclusive . in addition",
    ", we note that the direction of motion of the kinks was not recorded and therefore it can not be assessed whether or not the `` activity '' of those regions agrees with the transcription direction .",

    "this individual study is what we have presented here and we believe that the conclusion is clear : the effective potential shows no signature of the promoters .",
    "having verified this , in the next section we show that , if a detailed study of promoters is done , it must be over all the promoters of the phage in order to be conclusive .",
    "in this last section , we consider yet another recent approach to sg soliton dynamics that followed the steps of @xcite but using breathers instead of kinks @xcite . in this case , the author studied rna polymerase recognition of specific binding sites by comparing breathers to localised deformations of the dna duplex when the rna polymerase slides on its major groove . to this end",
    "he constructed a potential for sg breathers following the steps of @xcite , but using as _ ansatz _ a discretized breather , given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is related to the intrinsic frecuency of the breather .",
    "the potential obtained in @xcite is the following : @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the main difference between this potential and the one obtained in @xcite is that breathers defined by ( [ eq : breather ] ) are not static solutions of the sg model .",
    "this means , on the one hand , that the kinetic term of the sg hamiltonian ( that we do not write here ) has two extra terms when deriving @xmath77 with respect to time and squaring it , and that the potential term obtained depends explicitly on time .",
    "these problems may be solved by moving one of the extra terms from the kinetic to the potential term , and then integrating in time over a period .",
    "another important difference with @xcite is that kinks are very robust objects that behave very well in the discrete sg model , even for inhomogeneous sequences , and that is why they can be expressed in terms of its center .",
    "breathers , however , are very unstable in the homogeneous , discrete sg model , and it is to be expected that they are even more so on inhomogeneous sequences .",
    "therefore , we do not think that the potential for breathers may describe accurately and/or for long times the dynamics of an initially static breather .",
    "the construction of the sg potential for breathers is , therefore , not as straightforward as the one for kinks in @xcite , and this must be taken into account when analyzing the results .",
    "after the breather potential ( [ eq : potbreath ] ) was constructed in @xcite , it was used to analyze the early region of the @xmath0 genome and a particular region of the @xmath78 phage .",
    "it was suggested , among other things , that there is a correlation between deep wells of ( [ eq : potbreath ] ) and promoters in the early region and class iii @xmath0 promoters .",
    "another relation between deep wells and transcription terminators was also suggested .",
    "we can now apply the results obtained in section [ sec : t7 ] to the claims in @xcite by noticing how alike the weight functions of ( [ eq : poteff ] ) and ( [ eq : potbreath ] ) they are for @xmath79 ( which is the case , according to @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the structure of peaks and wells is very similar in both cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] , and we can thus extend the conclusions of section [ sec : t7 ] : even if the potential for sg breathers works in a similar way as the effective potential for sg kinks , it is not enough to explain the transcription process of rna polymerase . for instance , as shown in @xcite , there are deep wells in the potential for sg breathers near some of the promoters of the @xmath0 genome . however , there are other promoters ( class ii ) which are not near any deep well , and also deep wells which are not near promoters ( like the ones found in @xcite near terminators ) . when loosing the constraints in order to take into account not so deep wells which are near promoters",
    ", then many other wells far from promoters should be considered , too .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no special characteristic in the potential for breathers that allow the identification of promoters from the rest of the genome , by simply looking at the effective potential .",
    "potential @xmath80 ( [ eq : potbreath ] ) for breathers ( solid line ) and @xmath81 ( [ eq : poteff ] ) for kinks ( dashed line ) for the @xmath0 genome region going from bp 500 to bp 7000 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( which corresponds to the values used in the figures of @xcite ) .",
    "the scale of @xmath80 has been divided by @xmath84 in order to make it fit with the scale of @xmath81 .",
    "no vertical shifting was made in any potential .",
    "this region of the genome contains seven promoters .",
    ", width=226 ]",
    "the englander model was introduced in @xcite to explain long life times on open states of dna duplexes @xcite by means of the well known nonlinear sg model .",
    "subsequently , research on the sg model led to suggestions of a relation between functionally relevant positions in the sequence with dynamical properties of sg solitons . in section",
    "[ sec : salerno ] we showed that the results of kink dynamics moving along inhomogenous sequences developed in @xcite depend highly on the sequence under study . in order to achieve this we used the effective potential for sg kinks moving on inhomogeneous sequences , introduced in @xcite . applied to the sequences used in @xcite and to the corresponding real genomic sequences of the @xmath0 phage , we observed important differences between both potentials .",
    "differences came from the end parts of the analyzed sequences , which were a priori assumed not to have any role . with these findings and taking into account the good results already obtained for the particle - like approximation of sg kinks moving along inhomogeneous sequences @xcite , we concluded that early promoter regions of the @xmath0 genome can not be considered dinamically `` active '' . in section",
    "[ sec : t7 ] , addressing the question posed in @xcite , we searched for patterns that could differentiate the dynamics of kinks starting from @xmath0 promoters from kinks starting from the rest of the genomic sequence .",
    "again , we used the effective potential , this time applied to the whole genomic sequence of the @xmath0 phage . comparing the curves",
    "obtained for the 18 major promoters of the phage among them and also with other non - promoter regions led us to think that there was no special properties of the effective potential around promoter regions , and therefore that the dynamics of kinks moving from these regions was the same as in other genomic regions .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : breathers ] we applied the same arguments and also reviewed the problems of the potential for breathers in order to demonstrate that the potential for sg breathers obtained in @xcite can not be used to differentiate promoter regions in the genomic sequence . from all this evidence",
    ", we can confidently claim that neither the sg model nor its description in terms of the effective potential give hints about functionally relevant sites of dna sequences .",
    "we stress that this claim is about the sg model and the dynamics of its solitons .",
    "statistical mechanics approaches are also being studied with some success @xcite but that is a completely different approach .",
    "it is important to extend this discussion to include its biological implications .",
    "the relation of deep wells and functioning sites of dna can now be discussed in terms of properties of bacterial promoters @xcite .",
    "bacterial rna polymerase is a multisubunit complex .",
    "a detachable subunit , called @xmath85 factor , is responsible for reading the promoters , which are the signals enconded in the dna that tell it where to begin transcribing .",
    "most bacteria contain multiple @xmath85 factors that enable the recognition of different sets of promoters .",
    "a comparison of many different bacterial promoters reveals that they are heterogeneous in the dna sequence .",
    "however , they all contain related sequences that reflect on mechanical and electrostatic properties of the dna double helix that are recognized by the @xmath85 factor .",
    "these common features are often summarized in the form of a consensus sequence , which serves as a summary or `` average '' of a large number of individual nucleotide sequences .",
    "the precise sequence determines the strength ( or number of initiation events per unit time ) of each promoter .",
    "however , although the @xmath85 factor is needed in the transcription initiation , other elements can bind to rna polymerase to regulate the transcription of specific promoters , like the @xmath86 subunits .",
    "another important group of proteins that recognizes and binds to promoters are transcription factors .",
    "these proteins act as regulatory elements that control transcription initiation and bind to specific sequences .",
    "this summary of regulatory elements of transcription initiation in procaryotes reveals the intrinsic complexity of the sequences of promoters . in the case of eukaryotic regulation",
    "the complexity increases too much to try to summarize it in this paragraph , and we will just refer to the counter - intuitive fact that specific cg - rich promoters that are found in yeast @xcite . therefore , we conclude that , although deep wells in the potential for sg kinks or breathers are correlated with at - rich regions , they are not enough to recognize such complex structures as promoters , and it is only natural that the dynamics of these simple excitations can not capture the mechanisms of promoter function .",
    "we thank antonio marn for patient and helpful discussions about promoters .",
