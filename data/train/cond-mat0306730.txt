    "nowadays , most of the theoretical studies of the phase behaviour of a classical fluid are formulated in the language of the density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "within such a theory , the crystalline solid is viewed to be like an inhomogeneous system with a periodically modulated density profile @xmath0 , whose free energy is obtained through the optimization of a density functional @xmath1 $ ] which is built upon the structural properties of the fluid . in particular , a successful recipe for @xmath1 $ ] ( sometimes called the hohenberg - kohn - mermin ( hkm ) free energy ) is a local mapping into the free energy of a homogeneous fluid with a suitably chosen effective density @xmath2 , which is related in a non - local way to the real density @xmath0 . at variance with @xmath0 ,",
    "the smoothed density @xmath2 is a slowly - varying function of the position .",
    "this general method has been named the `` weighted - density approximation '' ( wda )  @xcite .",
    "this scheme has proved to be sufficient for purely hard - core systems and soft - repulsive ones .",
    "however , it badly fails in the presence of attractive interactions , where it may happen that the solid is being mapped onto a fluid with a density falling into the condensation gap where , actually , no homogeneous phase is present . nor it can be of help the fundamental - measure approach of rosenfeld  @xcite , which was recently extended from hard spheres  @xcite to spherically repulsive interactions  @xcite , but not yet to attractive fluids . in these cases ,",
    "the only available method is lowest - order perturbation theory  @xcite , which is tantamount to split the hkm free energy into the sum of the density functional for a reference system ( usually , a hard - core system ) and a remainder , containing the pair - distribution function of the inhomogeneous reference system . a sensible approximation for the latter would allow to draw accurate coexistence lines for the system under consideration . in the past",
    ", a scheme of this sort has been successfully applied by a number of authors to the prototypical case being represented by the truncated lennard - jones fluid  @xcite .    in the present paper , we prove that this method is effective , although with less quantitative success , also for lattice problems . as a case - study , we shall focus on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice - gas system which is known  @xcite to possess three phases with the features of vapour , liquid , and solid .",
    "it is argued in ref.@xcite that the existence in this model of a further liquid phase , besides the gaseous one , is made possible by the relatively long range of the interparticle attraction .",
    "we point out that the choice of a 2d ( rather than 3d ) system is only aimed at simplifying the forthcoming analysis of the interface problem . in this respect",
    ", a crucial test for our dft will be the prediction of surface melting , which is actually in the possibility of the dft , as is proved by the 3d continuum theory of ref.@xcite .",
    "while the general dft framework on a lattice ( _ i.e. _ , minimum principle for the generalized grand potential plus ornstein - zernike relation ) is already known  @xcite , we are not aware of any single example of the performance of the lattice dft in the wda for a system with a realistic phase diagram .",
    "we believe that testing the degree of sophistication of the lattice - dft method in a rich context , such as that provided by a three - phase lattice - gas model , can be interesting on fairly general grounds , _ e.g. _ for weighing up the superiority , if any , of the dft over other available statistical methods like the transfer - matrix  @xcite or the cluster variational methods  @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : after an outline , in section 2 , of the main contents of the lattice dft , we describe our system and method in section 3 , and present our results for the bulk of the system in section 4 .",
    "next , in section 5 , we analyse the structure of the interface between two bulk phases , including a demonstration of the phenomenon of surface melting . further remarks and a brief summary of the main results are given in the conclusions .",
    "we first review the lattice analogue of the classical dft , which was first considered by nieswand _ et al . _ in 1993  @xcite . like the parent theory in the continuum",
    ", the lattice dft is meant to provide a general framework for discussing the statistical properties of particles living on a regular lattice , in the presence of a site - dependent external potential or , even , of a self - sustained spatial inhomogeneity ( like the one which , in a simple fluid , becomes manifest at freezing ) .",
    "if lattice sites are allowed to be occupied by at most one particle , a general hamiltonian for our problem is @xmath3 , with @xmath4 we call @xmath5 the occupation number of site @xmath6 in the lattice , while @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pair - interaction and the external potential , respectively .    the grand - canonical partition function @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 and @xmath11 representing the inverse temperature and the chemical potential , respectively ) is a _ lattice functional _ , namely a function of all components @xmath12 of a lattice field , which we call the external field .",
    "then , it is a simple matter to show that the ( number- ) density field is given by : @xmath13 which is a functional of the external field ( a temperature dependence is also implied ) .",
    "@xmath14 is the grand potential , also a functional of @xmath15 . at variance with the continuum case ,",
    "the density field is a _ partial _ , rather than a functional , derivative of @xmath16 .    the hohenberg - kohn - mermin theorem , which holds also for lattice gases , ensures that there is a one - to - one correspondence , within the space of @xmath11-representable densities , between the density field and the external field .",

    "instead , we reserve the symbol @xmath21 for the density field derived from @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath28 $ ] is actually the inhomogeneous gibbs - bogoliubov functional of the classical mean - field theory .",
    "hence , a minimum principle holds , saying that @xmath28 $ ] attains its minimum value for a density profile which is precisely the one determined by the given external field , namely @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the minimum @xmath29 $ ] is nothing but the grand potential @xmath30 for the given @xmath11 .",
    "the necessary condition for the minimum reads : @xmath31    the minimum principle for @xmath28 $ ] is , besides the hkm theorem , the basic tenet of the dft , being at the heart of a broad family of approximate theories of freezing  @xcite .",
    "every such a theory starts from a prescription for @xmath1 $ ] , which is then used to determine an approximate grand potential for the system from which the thermodynamic properties are deduced .",

    "the importance of @xmath39 is two - fold : on one side , its knowledge permits to recover , through the oz relation , the pdf profile . on the other side ,",
    "most of the popular dft approximations use an expression of @xmath1 $ ] in terms of the dcf of the fluid .",
    "a number of simplifications occur for a homogeneous system ( _ i.e. _ , one with @xmath40 ) .",
    "owing to translational symmetry , the one - point dcf is a constant , @xmath41=c_1(\\rho)$ ] , whereas the two - point dcf is a function of @xmath42 only , that is @xmath43=c_2(i - j,\\rho)$ ] .",
    "furthermore , eq.([eq14 ] ) can be fourier - transformed  @xcite to give @xmath44 in terms of @xmath45 as : @xmath46 @xmath27 being the constant value of the density .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe a dft aimed at reconstructing the phase diagram of a realistic lattice gas , that is one with a phase diagram containing , besides a solid phase , also _ two _ different fluid phases , liquid and vapour . in order to speed up the discussion ,",
    "we have decided to confine most of the technicalities to a few appendices .",
    "in particular , appendix a illustrates the lattice counterpart of two celebrated , yet simple , theories of freezing : the ramakrishnan - yussouff ( ry ) theory and the tarazona s wda .",
    "we suggest the reading of appendix a before proceeding to the next paragraph .",
    "we shall work with the t345 model of ref.@xcite .",
    "this is a triangular - lattice model with a hard core covering first- and second - neighbor sites and a pair attraction ranging from third- to fifth - neighbor sites ( see fig.1 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the strength of the attraction reduces upon increasing the distance from a reference site : whence , a triangular solid is stable at high density and low temperature , with a maximum density of @xmath47 . upon comparing the solid and the vapour grand potentials",
    ", one can easily predict the zero - temperature value of the chemical potential at coexistence to be @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the pair - potential value at contact . to be specific ,",
    "we use hereafter the same @xmath50 values that were considered in ref.@xcite , namely @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , with @xmath53 . in that paper ,",
    "a combination of transfer - matrix calculations and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations distinctly showed the existence of a narrow temperature interval where the increase of @xmath11 , starting from large negative values , drives the system through a couple of sharp ( first - order ) phase transitions , _",
    "i.e. _ , vapour - liquid and liquid - solid , as is also revealed by the @xmath11-evolution of the number - density histogram at fixed temperature . for later convenience , two other models are introduced : the t3 model , which is the same as t345 but with @xmath54 , and the t model , where also @xmath55 and only the hard - core interaction is present . at variance with the t345 case , the mc simulation supports the existence of a unique fluid phase in both the t and t3 models .",
    "the first step in a typical dft calculation is the determination of an accurate dcf for the homogeneous system .",
    "in fact , an approximate @xmath1 $ ] is usually built upon this function ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the fluid dcf is the solution to the homogeneous oz relation plus a closure .",
    "for 3d hard spheres , the most celebrated closure of all is the percus - yevick approximation ( pya ) , which allows an exact determination of the dcf  @xcite . for a lattice system ,",
    "the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) is easier to implement than the pya , since it leads to a smaller set of unknown quantities . as a matter of fact",
    ", serious convergence problems are encountered when trying to solve numerically either the msa or the pya of the t345 fluid . instead",
    ", no such problems occur for the msa of the t or , even , the t3 model ( see details in appendix b ) , while the pya of the t3 model is still intractable . as a result , we see us forced to treat the t345 model perturbatively , as we are going to see in a moment ( note that our derivation of the perturbation formula , eq.([eq16 ] ) below , will be different from that of evans  @xcite ) .",

    "we note that , in eq.([eq16 ] ) , @xmath71 $ ] contains the exact , yet unknown , reduced pdf of the inhomogeneous t model .",
    "hence , the above equation is useless unless one finds a careful prescription for @xmath72 , which could be possibly _ different _ for the fluid and solid phases . before discussing this point further",
    ", we go back for a moment to the reference system .    after obtaining the dcf of the homogeneous t system ,",
    "we use eq.([a03 ] ) to calculate the fluid excess free energy per particle @xmath73 .",
    "this quantity , which is a monotonously increasing function of the density , ceases to be defined at @xmath74 , beyond which no msa solution is actually found . however , this density is too small for allowing a description ( within the wda ) of the very dense solid .",
    "hence , the problem arises as to what criterion should be used in order to extrapolate @xmath73 beyond that limit .",
    "this problem is discussed in appendix b , where two different solutions are proposed . here ,",
    "suffice it to say that there exists a method to prolong the definition of @xmath73 insofar as needed , with all regularity requirements fully met .",
    "we have sketched in appendix b the details of a simple dft ( the ry theory  @xcite ) for the freezing of the t model .",
    "however , in order to have a good description of the reference system , we have tried to do better than the ry theory .",
    "in fact , the stability of the liquid phase is a matter of a delicate balance between energy and entropy ; hence , an accurate representation of the solid free energy is an obvious necessity in all cases where a liquid phase is expected . leaving aside rosenfeld s fundamental - measure theory , whose extension to lattice fluids is not immediate ( see , however , the recent contribution @xcite ) , we have applied the lattice counterpart of the wda in the version implemented by tarazona  @xcite , which gives rather good results for the hard - sphere system .",
    "this theory is reviewed in the appendices a ( general ) and c ( t model ) . here",
    ", we provide just a few details on the method .    the hypothesis underlying any wda is an approximation of the excess free energy of the system as @xmath75 , where the weighted density @xmath76 is a non - local functional of the density field , given implicitly by @xmath77 . in turn , the weight function @xmath78 is such that both the density and the dcf of the fluid are recovered in the homogeneous limit . in the tarazona s wda , the further assumption is made that the weight function is a second - order polynomial in the density @xmath27 .",
    "we thus have a well - defined algorithm to build up the excess free energy and , eventually , the density functional that is used to trace the conditions for fluid - solid coexistence .",
    "once the free energy of the reference system is given , we are left with the problem of incorporating the attraction @xmath58 into the density functional of the t system using eq.([eq16 ] ) .",
    "we shall distinguish between the fluid and the solid , although this way the hkm functional will only approximately be the same for all phases ( this will have some harmful consequences for the interface structure , see section 5 ) . while we obviously use for the fluid the reduced pdf of the homogeneous t system ,",
    "as far as the solid is concerned we shall make the ( apparently bad ) approximation @xmath79=1 $ ] outside the core , which is the same assumption of the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "in fact , we agree with mederos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that the pdf of the low - temperature solid is _ trivial _ , since all the structure ( which in a fluid is accounted for by the reduced pdf ) is already present at the level of @xmath80 itself  @xcite .",
    "this is rather obvious at @xmath81 , where @xmath82 at the typical distances of the perfect solid , while being undefined elsewhere . for small , but non - zero temperatures , a quasi - random ( ideal - gas - like ) distribution of interstitials and vacancies would extend the result @xmath83 to all distances outside the core region .    a more refined approximation for the attractive interaction would be that of ref.@xcite .",
    "this theory uses the same prescription for the solid and the fluid , based on the use of the compressibility sum rule .",
    "however , the implementation of this method is also very difficult and much more involved than ours . in particular",
    ", the two algorithms for minimization that are described in appendix b do both require the numerical evaluation of the density derivatives of the dft functional , which is indeed a very difficult task to accomplish if the recipe of ref.@xcite is followed .",
    "for the sake of truth , we have also attempted to use the method of ref.@xcite .",
    "this relies on two approximations : i ) the use of eq.([eq16 ] ) for the t345 _ fluid _ ; and ii ) the decomposition of the dcf of the inhomogeneous t345 system as the sum of the analogous function for the t system and a remainder @xmath84 , assumed to be zero inside the core and msa - like outside this region . as a matter of fact",
    ", we found no stable liquid phase by this method .",
    "going back to our theory , we write the difference in grand potential between the triangular solid ( whose density field can be parametrized by means of two numbers only , see below ) and the fluid with equal @xmath85 and @xmath11 as the minimum of : @xmath86 note that , in the above equation : i ) @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the number densities in the sublattices @xmath89 and @xmath90 of occupied and unoccupied sites , respectively ( see appendix b ) ; ii ) @xmath91 is the functional for the t model , defined at eq.([c01 ] ) ; iii ) @xmath92 is the coordination number for the @xmath21-th shell , that is @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ; and iv ) @xmath95 is the value taken by the reduced pdf of the t fluid at the @xmath21-th - neighbour separation .",

    "this result can be rationalized as follows : in the t345 model , the existence of attractive sites at the `` interstitial '' distances @xmath126 and @xmath127 causes the upper stability threshold of the fluid phase to move up in density with respect to the t3 model , thus contributing to unveil the triple point .",
    "this effect is missing in the t3 model , which thus fails to become a liquid .",

    "is partly responsible for the wrong position of the freezing and melting lines . to overcome this problem ,",

    "the solution method is iterative : at a given @xmath27 , we make an initial estimate of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , which are then updated using the inverse of the fourier transform ( [ eq15 ] ) .",

    "the occurrence of surface melting in the t345 model is demonstrated by the structure of the interface in the central part of the picture , which is compatible with that of a `` modulated '' liquid which strongly feels the underlying crystal ordering .    in fig.9 ( bottom ) , we have plotted the density profile across the solid - vapour interface at @xmath187 , as calculated through the minimization of @xmath171 $ ] . from a look at this figure , we see that there are a few layers , interposed between the solid and the vapour , where the values of the sublattice densities are intermediate between those of the coexisting solid and vapour and close , on average , to that of the incoming liquid ( @xmath193 , at @xmath154 ) .",
    "interestingly , a further evidence ( see fig.10 ) goes in support of the surface - melting interpretation , namely the existence of a maximum in @xmath194 near @xmath195 , and of another , less pronounced , in @xmath196 .",

    "notwithstanding the crudeness of our method , we nonetheless think that figs.9 ( bottom ) and 10 do indeed catch the genuine behaviour of the t345 system .",
    "in this paper , we have used the lattice dft method to analyse the phase behaviour of a 2d lattice - gas model ( named t345 ) which exhibits a solid , a liquid , and a vapour phase .",

    "we have built up an accurate solid structure for the purely hard - core model by working with the wda of tarazona , while the remaining part of the t345 potential has been treated as a mean field .",
    "this method is expected to provide good results both at very low and at very high temperatures , and to offer a not too bad interpolation in between .    as a matter of fact",
    ", our theory passes the crucial test of predicting the existence of a liquid phase in the t345 model .",
    "in particular , the ratio of the triple to the critical temperature is found to reproduce the exact value to within 2% .",
    "another successful result is the prediction , in agreement with mc simulation , of the disappearance of the liquid phase when the range of the attraction is reduced to embrace third neighbors only .",
    "the main drawback of the theory is in the estimate of the freezing as well as of the melting density which , in the worst case , fall short of the exact values by about 35% .",
    "this inconvenient should be ascribed , besides to the crudeness of the mfa approach ( also worsened by the low system dimensionality ) , also to the low quality of the msa for the hard - core fluid ( the hnca is not viable since it does not converge even at moderate densities ) .",
    "having produced a qualitatively sound bulk theory , we have moved to a description of the interface structure in the t345 model . the same functional built up for the bulk system has been used to describe the coexistence between the solid and the vapour phases .",
    "actually , the use of slightly different functional forms for the generalized grand potentials of the solid and of the vapour forces us to introduce a spurious boundary condition on the vapour side of the interface .",
    "if we allow for this artifice , we do in fact observe the appearance , just below the triple - point temperature , of a very thin liquid - like layer in between the solid and the vapour , which is the sign of the occurrence of surface melting in the system .",
