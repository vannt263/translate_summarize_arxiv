    "studied special cases of problems in oscillatory domains near half spaces going through the origin , using viscosity solutions as well as stochastic control theory . generalizing the results of @xcite , barles , da lio and souganidis @xcite studied the problem for operators with oscillating coefficients , in half - space type domains",
    "whose boundary is parallel to the axes of periodicity , with a series of assumptions which guarantee the existence of approximate corrector . in @xcite the continuity property of the averaged neumann boundary data in half - spaces , with respect to the normal direction , was studied in the case of homogeneous operator @xmath11 .",

    "the main steps in extending aforementioned results from half - space type domains to general domains are the following .",
    "the plan is to use these solutions in strip domains to approximate those in general domains . for the stability of such approximation one requires the distribution of @xmath5 to be invariant on @xmath51 regardless of the choice of @xmath16 , which is the case if @xmath52 is not a multiple of vectors in @xmath53 : we call such vectors _ irrational_. for irrational @xmath52 we show that there is a unique linear profile the solutions converges to , by proving an oscillation lemma as well as using a quantitative version of weyl s equi - distribution theorem .    secondly , to establish sufficient stability to address the general domains , some estimate on the convergence mode of @xmath54- solutions in the strip domain , in terms of the variation of @xmath52 , is necessary . establishing this estimate",
    "is our second , and most challenging , main step ( theorem  [ continuity ] ) . for problems with divergence - form structure ,",
    "such estimates were obtained in @xcite and @xcite ( also see @xcite ) by means of integral formulas . in our setting we must proceed by maximum principle - type arguments , which requires careful perturbation of the boundary data as well as construction of delicate barriers which describes the averaging behavior of solutions up to the neumann boundary .",
    "the proof of theorem 4.1 is based on the observation that , in  meso - scopic \" scale , the distribution of @xmath5 on two hyperplanes with close irrational normals are similar ( see section 4.1 . for a heuristic discussion of this fact ) .",
    "we adopt a multi - scale homogenization argument to address separately the effects on the solution caused by ( a ) microscopic oscillation of @xmath5 near the neumann boundary ( b ) the difference in normal directions and ( c ) the oscillation present in the operator @xmath11 .",
    "we mention that a significant difficulty arises due to the presence of the @xmath55-dependence in @xmath11 in addition to the oscillations in @xmath5 . to get around this difficulty",
    ", we use localization arguments as well as the existing homogenization results ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) to show homogenization occurs away from the neumann boundary .",
    "such strategy works since near the neumann boundary the oscillation of the first derivative ( @xmath5 ) dominates the behavior of solutions .",

    "we introduce some notations as well as preliminary results which will be used in the rest of the paper . in section 3",
    "we first study the averaging properties of the operator in the strip ( half - space type ) domains , to show that if the hypersurface is normal to an irrational direction then there is a unique homogenized neumann data in the limit @xmath47 . besides the complications that the inhomogeities in the operator @xmath11 cause , the proof of averaging phenomena in this setting is due to the weyl s distribution theorem , whose quantitative version that we need is borrowed from @xcite and is stated in theorem  [ lemma - m ] . in section 4",
    "we prove the main estimate on the mode of convergence of @xmath54-solutions in the strip domain as the normal @xmath52 varies around a reference direction .",
    "after a heuristic description of the proof , we prove a series of lemmas which describe the behavior of solutions in different regions of the strip domain , divided in terms of the distance to the neumann boundary . based on the lemmas then we are able to construct suitable barriers to obtain the desired estimate ( theorem 4.1 ) .",
