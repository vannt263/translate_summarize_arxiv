    "in general , many - body systems with interactions are very difficult to solve exactly . a way to overcome this difficulty is by approaching the many - body problem by a one - body problem , in which a mean - field replaces the interactions affecting the body .",
    "this idea is applied to the ferromagnetic ising model ( see reference @xcite ) . in the most simple mean - field approach ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor interactions affecting each spin @xmath0 are replaced in such a way that @xmath0 now interacts with an effective field given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the coordination number , @xmath3 the exchange constant , and @xmath4 is the thermal average of the spin @xmath5 .",
    "this is the so called `` weiss mean - field approach '' @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it neglects the spin correlations , and it leads the transition temperature @xmath6 as well as the values of the critical exponents away from the exact values ( @xmath7 , for all dimensions ) .",
    "however , for the one - dimensional case , the ising model lacks of a phase transition at finite temperature , but weiss approach wrongly predicts that @xmath8 .    a further step for improving the solution of this problem , is to use the proposal of hans bethe , which consists in considering that a central spin should interact with all its nearest - neighbor spins forming a cluster @xcite .",
    "then , that cluster would interact to an effective -field that approaches the next - nearest - neighbor spins surrounding the cluster .",
    "thus , this improvement gives @xmath9 , which not only betters the approximation of the critical temperatures , but leads correctly to @xmath10 , for the one - dimensional case . in this way",
    ", the correlations between the spins has been included to some degree by considering a cluster of spins interacting with its nearest - neighbors .",
    "the mean - field approach used in ising - like models with finite - size clusters is based on the following hamiltonian splitting :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 corresponds to the energy that is composed of spin variables of the finite cluster , whereas @xmath13 , corresponds to the energy of the neighborhood , whose spins do not belong to the central sites of the finite cluster . in the canonical ensemble",
    ", the calculation of mean values of the spin variables @xmath14 belongs to the subspace @xmath15 of the finite cluster , and it is computed by the following procedure :    @xmath16    this equation is exact if @xmath17 = 0 $ ] .    the great merit of eq.([mo ] ) , is that we can solve the model of the infinite system by using a finite system in the subspace @xmath15 .",
    "various approximation methods use eq.([mo ] ) as a starting point .",
    "one of them is the effective - field theory ( eft ) proposed by honmura and kaneyoshi @xcite for solving the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic system .",
    "@xcite applied eft so as to treat different magnetic models with competing interactions .",
    "recently , viana _ et al . _",
    "@xcite developed a mean - field proposal for spin models , denominated effective correlated mean - field ( ecmf ) , based on the following ansatz :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are the neighbors of the central spins of the finite cluster , @xmath20 is the mean of the spin variable of the cluster , and @xmath21 is a term exhibiting the behavior of a molecular parameter .",
    "there are many ways of determining the parameter @xmath22 . in the present work we use eq .",
    "( [ rel3 ] ) by proposing that @xmath21 be the mean response of the spins of a monte carlo simulation ( smc ) , thus we make use of the following expression :    @xmath23    where    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the number of monte carlo steps of the traditional metropolis algorithm , and @xmath26 is the total number of sites @xmath27 used in smc . in",
    "what follows , we call this new mean - field monte carlo technique as mft - mc .",
    "the aim of this proposal is the improvement of the results obtained by other mean - field techniques , but we believe that the main advantage of our mean - field proposal is the simplicity in which we can treat the first - order phase transitions . accordingly , in this work , we implemented this proposal in the spin-1 blume - capel model in the linear chain and in the square lattice .",
    "we remark that the blume - capel model ( @xmath28 ) @xcite is one of the most suitable models for studying magnetic systems from the point of view of the statistical mechanics .",
    "this model and its generalization , the blume - emery - griffiths model , ( @xmath29 ) was proposed to describe the @xmath30 transition in @xmath31 mixtures @xcite as well as ordering in a binary alloy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , its applications also include the description of ternary fluids @xcite , solid - liquid - gas mixtures and binary fluids @xcite , micro - emulsions @xcite , ordering in semiconducting alloys @xcite and electron conduction models @xcite .",
    "indeed , the bc model is found in many works using different lattices , spin degrees , including disorder and different statistical mechanic techniques @xcite .",
    "the bc model is represented by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath32    where @xmath3 is the ferromagnetic coupling between the spins @xmath33 of the lattice and @xmath34 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "when the value of @xmath34 increases from zero , the energy levels @xmath35 tend to the state @xmath36 , in such a way that when @xmath37 all the spins take the value @xmath36 and the system suffers a first - order phase transition , i.e. , the system goes from the ordered state ( @xmath38 ) to the state ( @xmath36 ) through a jump discontinuity .",
    "the critical value @xmath39 can be determined by equating the energy of the order and disordered states , i.e. ,    @xmath40    therefore , the bc model provides us a phase diagram with a a tricritical point separating a second and a first - order frontier that divides the ferromagnetic order ( f ) and the paramagnetic region ( pm ) .",
    "this rich critical behavior qualifies the bc model for representing different phase transitions , and our purpose is to apply the mft - mc method in it .",
    "the phase diagram of the bc model with equivalent - neighbor interactions can be seen in fig.1 of reference @xcite , which is qualitatively the same for dimensions greater than one .",
    "in order to study the ferromagnetic model in the square lattice , we use fig.1 as a reference . in this figure",
    "we may see that @xmath41 represents the neighbors of the central sites @xmath42 , which compose the finite cluster of @xmath43 sites .",
    "so , the hamiltonian of the bc model is conveniently written in the following form :    @xmath44    where @xmath3 is the ferromagnetic coupling factor , @xmath45 is the number of spins @xmath41 interacting with @xmath27 and @xmath34 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ hf ] ) can be rewritten as follows :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 and    @xmath50    in the present work the ansatz given in eq .",
    "( [ rel3 ] ) is our fundamental assumption , so    @xmath51    in this work we considered clusters containing @xmath52 central sites .",
    "thus , we have the following relations :    @xmath53    the magnetization per particle @xmath54 of the magnetic system is given by the following definition :    @xmath55    where the partition function in the space of sites @xmath42 is given by    @xmath56    an important issue is the thermodynamic treatment of the spin system , accordingly , we use the free energy given by the following equation :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the reduced temperature and @xmath59 is a parameter to be determined . at the equilibrium ,",
    "the free energy is minimized , thus :    @xmath60    where the function @xmath61 stands for the equation of state given by    @xmath62    and we can determine the parameter @xmath59 by using eq .",
    "( [ cond6 ] ) .",
    "we firstly obtained the phase diagram of the bc model in the plane @xmath63-@xmath64 in a square lattice , based on the considerations of the previous section . in fig .",
    "( 2 ) we show the phase diagram for clusters containing @xmath65 ( in ( a ) ) and @xmath66 ( in ( b ) ) central sites .",
    "we faced the computational problem of solving the model for big clusters , inasmuch as the number of accessible states corresponds to @xmath67 states .",
    "for instance , for @xmath66 and @xmath68 sites , we have accessible states of order @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , which are huge numbers .",
    "accordingly , for clusters of sizes @xmath71 , we prefer only to calculate the critical temperature @xmath72 , for @xmath73 , and the coordinates of the tricritical point @xmath74 .    in order to plot the frontiers in fig .",
    "( 2 ) , we used @xmath75 , for the size of the square lattice , and @xmath76 monte carlo steps in the simulation so as to obtain the molecular parameter @xmath21 .",
    "it should be noted that , for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the results of the physical parameters obtained in the mean - field approach are just the same . in this figure",
    "we may observe that the critical value of the anisotropy corresponds to @xmath79 , for @xmath80 , which agrees with exact results obtained when equating the energy of the ordered state @xmath81 , with the energy of the disordered one ( @xmath82 ) , for a finite system of @xmath83 sites , i.e. ,    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the coordination number of the lattice .",
    "the black circle represents the tricritical point that separates the second - order and the first - order frontier .",
    "we observe that the critical temperature @xmath72 decreases as the size of the cluster @xmath43 increases .",
    "the first - order frontier correctly falls perpendicularly to the anisotropy axis , however , in general , effective - field results do not reproduce this feature of the first - order frontier ( see the ieft curve in figure 5 of reference @xcite ) .",
    "in table 1 we present the values of @xmath72 , obtained for each cluster size @xmath43 , where we compare the results of this work using mft - mc with the mean - field approximation that uses clusters ( mft ) , where @xmath86 , in this case .",
    "we remark that yksel _",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath87 , by using a metropolis monte carlo simulation , whereas silva _",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath88 using wang - landau sampling . in references @xcite and @xcite we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "we may observe that the results obtained by the mft - mc approach are close to the smc values when the cluster size is increased .",
    "nevertheless , if compared with the mft results , @xmath72 is better estimated by the mft - mc method , regarding the smc results as a reference .",
    "the calculations of the tricritical points @xmath74 through the mft - mc technique are shown in table 2 .",
    "we see that when the cluster size @xmath43 is increased , the values of the critical anisotropy @xmath91 approach the values @xmath92 and @xmath93 obtained by the monte carlo simulations of references @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in what the value @xmath94 respects ,",
    "the tendency of the convergence is closer to that of reference @xcite , which gives @xmath95 , within their effective - field approach ( ieft ) .",
    "the coordinates of the tricritical point were determined through a landau expansion ,    @xmath96    from this equation , we are interested in solving the following system of equations    @xmath97    in order to obtain the tricritical point .",
    "so , we may note that    @xmath98    corresponds to the equation that determines the coefficients @xmath99 .    in fig .",
    "( 3 ) and fig . ( 4 )",
    "we can see the behavior of the magnetization and the entropy , respectively .",
    "these are related to the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "( 2 ) , for @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the magnetization and the entropy curves , as functions of the temperature , were used to exemplify the first - order phase transition happening for @xmath100 , and the second - order phase transition , for @xmath101 . in fig .",
    "( 3 ) we may observe that the magnetization falls down to zero continuously for the second - order phase transition ( see curve ( a ) ) , while it suffers of jump discontinuity for the first - order one ( see curve ( b ) ) .",
    "the study of the entropy per site is developed from the following expression :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 means that all the other variables must be fixed in this differentiation . in fig .",
    "( 4 ) the entropy exhibits an inflection point at the second - order transition ( in curve ( b ) ) , nevertheless , we may see a discontinuity at the first - order transition being characterized by @xmath104 ( see curve ( a ) ) , thus indicating the presence of a latent heat equal to @xmath105 , at the corresponding transition temperature . in the limit of high temperatures ( @xmath106 )",
    "the entropy is @xmath107 , where the number @xmath108 is the number of accessible states for each spin of a spin-1 system .",
    "this result is correct in the canonical formalism .    in order to study other lattices",
    ", we particularly consider the criticality of an uni - dimensional lattice . in fig .",
    "( 5 ) we have the scheme of an uni - dimensional lattice used in modeling the mean - field theory .",
    "the terms @xmath109 correspond to the following expressions for each size @xmath43 :    @xmath110    in table 3 we show the results of the critical temperature @xmath72 for the uni - dimensional lattice , running @xmath76 monte carlo steps so as to get the molecular parameter @xmath22 . we may observe that when the size of the cluster @xmath43 is increased the value of the critical temperature tends to zero , which is correct for an uni - dimensional system with nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "so , though the convergence to the zero temperature is slow with @xmath43 , it proves that the mft - mc works in the lowest dimension .",
    "in this paper we study the ferromagnetic spin-1 blume - capel model with nearest - neighbor interactions , within a mean - field approach , which uses the magnetization response of a monte carlo simulation , as the molecular field .",
    "we call this new approach as mft - mc . for the bi - dimensional case",
    ", we implemented the model in the square lattice .",
    "the results show that when the size of the cluster @xmath43 increases , the values of the critical temperature @xmath72 ( for null anisotropy ) tend to @xmath111 , which is the monte carlo estimation of yksel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see table 1 ) .",
    "another important result is related to the estimation of the tricritical point @xmath74 in comparison with the results of silva @xcite and yksel@xcite ( see table 2 ) .",
    "our mft - mc values of @xmath91 reasonably agree with the results of the monte carlo simulations , as @xmath43 increases , whereas @xmath94 tends to the effective - field ( ieft ) result developed in reference @xcite .    in order to test our mft - mc approach ,",
    "we applied it to the uni - dimensional case , where we can verify through table 3 , that the critical temperature converges to zero for larger sizes .",
    "this shows that the mft - mc works well for uni - dimensional and bi - dimensional lattices .",
    "furthermore , this proposal allows an analysis of the thermodynamic properties after obtaining the entropy and the specific heat curves . on the other hand",
    ", the possibility of working with larger sizes constitutes an advantage for analyzing the finite - size effects . finally , we hope that this new approaching technique can be applied satisfactorily in other models and lattices ."
