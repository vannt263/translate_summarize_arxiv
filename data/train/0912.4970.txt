    "a characteristic six - membered ring appears at the step - edge region .",
    "surface atoms on the flat region , form tilted zigzag chains of threefold - coordinated atoms , as explained in the first paragraph of the present section .",

    "the zigzag chain with the reverse tilting is also obtained .",
    "it is remarkable that the surface atoms at the step - edge region , marked as @xmath5 and r , also form a zigzag chains of threefold - coordinated atoms , as on the flat region .",
    "one can consider , therefore , that the two tilted structures may be stable at the step - edge region , as on the flat region , although the simulation results contain only one tilted structure in which the @xmath6 atoms is placed on the vacuum - side region and the @xmath5 atoms is on the bulk - side region .",
    "moreover , the calculated ldos indicates a bias - dependent image of the scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ( stm ) both on the flat region and the step - edge regions .",

    "@xcite the calculation predicts the same bias - dependent image on the step - edge region . the same step - edge structures and its bias - dependent stm image were suggested also for ge cases , because of the similarity of electronic structure .",
    "the properties of the stepped si(111)-2@xmath01 surface , predicted by the large - scale calculation , were confirmed by the dft - pw calculation with a smaller sample .",

    "[ fig - frac ] .",
    "hereafter , the structure in fig .  [ fig - stepped - vasp ] ( a ) is called l - type step - edge structure , since the @xmath5 atom , the left atom of the step edge region , is located at the vacuum - side region and the @xmath6 atom , the right atoms , is located at the bulk - side region . the structure in fig .",
    "[ fig - stepped - vasp ] ( b ) indicates the reverse tilting at the step - edge region and is called r - type structure .",
    "the energy of the @xmath5-type structure is lower than that of the @xmath6-type structure by @xmath11 ev per atom pair of the zigzag chain .",
    "additional calculations were carried out , so as to clarify physical discussions for the two step - edge structures .",
    "first , the structures were calculated with different tilting structures on the flat region , in which the zigzag chains on the flat region , such as the @xmath8 and @xmath9 atoms in fig .",
    "[ fig - stepped - vasp ] , form the reverse tilting structure .",
    "the calculation result indicates that the above energy difference ( @xmath12 ev ) is independent on the tilting strctures of the flat region and that the above energy difference stems from the local tilting structure of the step - edge region .",
    "second , the energy difference was calculated also by the tight - binding form hamiltonian used in the large - scale calculation and gives @xmath13ev , which agrees satisfactorily with the above _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "although the existence of the two stable structures at the step - edge regions is reasonable , as discussed in the previous section , it is interesting that the cleavage simulation of fig .",
    "[ fig - frac ] contains the r - type structure , the higher energy structure of the two .",
    "the appearance of the higher energy structure in the cleavage simulation can be understood , since the @xmath6 atom is located on an upper position than the @xmath5 atom , in an ideal diamond structure .",
    "the simulation realizes the dynamics with the time scale in 10 ps and it might be difficult to reproduce the transformation process from the r - type structure into the l - type one .     is set to be @xmath14 -0.7 ev and @xmath15 + 0.7 ev in the left and right panels , respectively .",

    "the calculated stm images for the flat region shows the same bias - dependency .",
    "these results are consistent to those of the large - scale calculation .",
    "here it is noteworthy that the stm image for the r - type structure should be discussed more carefully , both in theory and experiment , since the height of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 atoms are different significantly , by approximately 1  . when stm images were calculated as the constant height calculations , like those for the l - type structure in fig .",
    "[ fig - stm - vasp ] , and the probed height was set to be slightly higher than the @xmath6 atom , the calculated images contain only the images for the @xmath6 atom , like the right panel of fig .",

    "the wavefunction is a @xmath17-like state located on the vacuum - side ( @xmath5 ) atom at the step edge region and the same property is seen on the wavefunction on the flat surface ( fig.2(a ) of ref .",
    "the energy gap between the occupied and unoccupied levels vanishes at the @xmath16 point in fig .",
    "[ fig-4-step - edge - wfn](a ) .",
    "it is speculated that the gap is underestimated artificially , as usually within dft calculations , and a finite gap should appear in a real system , as that of ref .",

    "the energy of the @xmath5-type step - edge structure is lower than that of the @xmath6-type structure , as in the si case .",
    "the energy difference between them is comparable to that in the si case ( @xmath18 ev ) .",
    "therefore , the appearance of the stepped ( 111)-2x1 structure should be understood as a common property of the si and ge cases , which is consistent to the discussion in the previous section .",
