    "defined quasi - universal independence which allows non - commutativity of independence by replacing partitions in the definition of universal independence by ordered partitions .",
    "later muraki introduced natural independence in @xcite as a generalization of the paper @xcite .",
    "he proved that there are only five kinds of natural independence : tensor , free , boolean , monotone and anti - monotone independences . since essential difference does not appear between monotone and anti - monotone independences for the purpose of this paper",

    "independence for subsets @xmath23 is defined by taking the algebras @xmath2 generated by @xmath24 ( without the unit of @xmath11 in the case of monotone or boolean independence ) .",
    "many probabilistic notions have been introduced for each kind of independence . in particular , analogues of cumulants",
    "are a central topic in this field . in the usual probability theory , cumulants",
    "are extensively used in the study such as the correlation function of a stochastic process .",
    "when more than one random variables are concerned , cumulants for a single random variable are not adequate and their extension to the multivariate case is required .",

    "voiculescu introduced free cumulants in @xcite for a single random variable as an analogy of the cumulants in probability theory .",
    "later speicher defined free cumulants for the multivariate case @xcite .",
    "speicher also clarified that non - crossing partitions appear in the relation between moments and free cumulants .",

    "a crucial idea was a very general notion of independence called an exchangeability system @xcite .",
    "monotone cumulants however can not be defined in lehner s approach .",

    "the additivity of monotone cumulants for a single variable does not hold because of the non - commutativity of monotone independence . instead , we proved in @xcite that monotone cumulants for a single variable satisfy that @xmath39 holds if @xmath40 are identically distributed and monotone independent .",
    "the notion of a dot operation is important throughout this paper .",

    "actually , a motivation of the paper @xcite was the observation that the coefficients of @xmath369 had nice properties as cumulants .",

    "let @xmath25 be bounded and self - adjoint for simplicity .",
    "then @xmath377 may not be a moment generating function of a probability measure for general @xmath378 and @xmath25 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath377 becomes a moment generating function of a probability measure for any @xmath378 if and only if the probability distribution of @xmath25 is monotone infinitely divisible .",
    "the reader might wonder if there is a relation between the moment and cumulant generating functions without the use of @xmath43 .",

    "the basic relation is given by @xmath382 therefore , @xmath381 can be expressed by using the inverse function of @xmath383 .",
