    "systems of adsorbed particles can be classified to ones of penetrable @xcite vs. impenetrable particles @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the case of penetrable rods .",
    "many of the systems of interest in this context are essentially two dimensional and can be studied by a model in which @xmath5 penetrable rods are randomly distributed on a two dimensional surface of size @xmath6 .",
    "each rod is of length @xmath7 and width @xmath8 .",
    "the effective two dimensional coverage is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the rod density .",
    "it provides a measure of the fraction of the area which is covered by the rods , where the reduction due to overlaps is ignored .",
    "clusters of overlapping rods start to form at low rod density and increase in size as the density increases .",
    "systems of this type exhibit a percolation transition at rod density @xmath11 , above which there is an cluster which spans across the entire system .",
    "the percolation transition for systems of rod - like particles has been studied extensively in recent years @xcite . a criterion for the percolation density @xmath11",
    "was obtained and examined for a variety of systems with different distributions of rod sizes and orientations . according to this criterion , percolation for isotropically oriented and",
    "randomly distributed rods occurs at rod density @xmath12 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath13 is the excluded area for placement of the center of a rod given that it may not intersect a rod already on the surface .",
    "this area , averaged over the isotropic orientational distribution is @xcite : @xmath14 note that , since the excluded area @xmath13 , is not simply related to the rod area @xmath15 , the percolation threshold can not be expressed as a function of the coverage @xmath16 alone .",
    "this distinguishes the rods from isotropic objects such as disks for which the excluded area is related to the disk area by a constant factor @xcite .",
    "this difference is especially important in the case of large aspect ratio of the rods . in particular , for @xmath17 , the coverage vanishes but the excluded area does not .",
    "the properties of the infinite percolation cluster at the transition have been studied extensively for lattice systems as well as for continuous systems such the the ones considered here @xcite . in particular , its fractal nature was established .",
    "the fractal dimension , which can be expressed in terms of other critical exponents was found to be universal @xcite .",
    "properties such as correlation functions and cluster size distributions were also examined @xcite .",
    "in addition to percolation systems , spatial fractal structures have been observed in a great variety of systems in physics @xcite and chemistry @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform multiple resolution analysis of systems composed of randomly adsorbed rods below the percolation threshold @xmath11 . in many empirical systems of this type , where adsorption and aggregation processes take place , fractal structures appear over a range of length scales for densities below @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "moreover , a broad spectrum of fractal dimensions has been observed experimentally in such systems . to gain a better understanding of empirical fractal structures composed of rod - like particles we study these structures using multi - scale analysis , based on the box - counting ( bc ) function . in this analysis",
    "we examine the fractal properties of the entire system rather than a particular cluster .",
    "this procedure is the one most commonly used in experimental studies of adsorption and aggregation phenomena . in our analysis , we concentrate on a range of rod densities below the percolation threshold , where the area fraction covered by the rods is small .",
    "we identify two ranges of length scales , in which the observed dimension of the system is different from the space dimension . for length scales larger than the typical rod length , the results resemble those obtained for randomly distributed spheres @xcite .",
    "an apparent fractal behavior is observed within a range of length scales between the rod length and the average distance between adjacent rods , which can span up to two decades .",
    "however , as was found before in percolation systems , highly anisotropic particles exhibit new and important features which do not appear in the study of isotropic particles such as spheres .",
    "in particular , we observe that , unlike the case of spheres , the upper cutoff ( and thus the range over which apparent fractal behavior appears ) can not be expressed in terms of the effective coverage alone , but also depends on the excluded area .",
    "moreover , we find that the apparent fractal dimension ( fd ) depends on the orientational distribution and decreases as it becomes more anisotropic . for length scales below the rod length , the bc function is dominated by the structure of the single rod whether simple or itself fractal .",
    "the class of systems which exhibits these two ranges includes the broad class of systems in which fractal - like clusters are adsorbed on a surface . to examine the fractal properties of such systems we study a simple one dimensional model in which the randomly distributed objects are cantor sets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model of randomly distributed rods is introduced in section ii and the box - counting function is examined .",
    "rods of zero width are studied in section iii , randomly distributed cantor sets in section iv and a summary is presented in section v.",

    "an analytical solution for the bc function @xmath28 will now be obtained , and its slope examined in the different domains .",
    "imagine the surface of area @xmath18 to be initially empty and arbitrarily choose one of the grid - boxes of size @xmath26 .",

    "this will be done by applying the standard fractal procedure @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the apparent fractal dimension ( fd ) .",
    "as stated above , the range which has been the focus of attention is the one in between the cutoffs @xmath67 .",

    "this is a non - trivial result , since a power - law distribution is poorly described by its mean , yet this is essentially the only distribution - related quantity needed to express the bc function .",

    "we consider the effect of endowing the rods with an internal ( fractal ) structure .",

    "we have performed a multiple resolution analysis using box counting functions to structures composed of randomly adsorbed rods .",
    "such structures appear in a large variety of adsorption phenomena and in many physical systems including liquid crystals , aggregates of linear molecules and fibers and line fractures .",
    "the scaling properties of these systems are determined by the particle size ( length and width ) distribution , orientation distribution , as well as by correlations in the positions and orientations . in processes such as",
    "paper fiber sedimentation particles tend to aggregate into dense regions and create inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "in other systems , rods can not overlap giving rise to a maximal jamming density @xcite .",
    "we have studied the case where rods can overlap and there are no positional or orientational correlations between them .",
    "we examined various size distributions and orientation distributions , found an analytical expression for the box counting function and compared the analytical results to numerical simulations .    for rod densities below the percolation threshold , we identified two interesting ranges of length - scales in which the box counting analysis gives rise to non trivial scaling properties . in the range of length scales between the typical rod length and the typical distance between adjacent rods , the box counting function is determined by the positional and orientational distribution of the rods in the plane rather than the structure of the single rod .",
    "this gives rise to an apparent fractal behavior over a finite range of up to two decades .",
    "unlike the case of randomly distributed isotropic objects ( disks ) , the range of length scales over which apparent fractal behavior is observed depends not only on effective coverage but also on the excluded area ( averaged over the orientational distribution ) . moreover , the apparent fractal dimension depends on the orientational distribution and decreases as it becomes more anisotropic .    for length scales smaller than the typical rod length , the box counting function",
    "is determined by the internal structure of the rod . in case of ordinary one dimensional rods",
    "this gives rise to a dimension of 1 .",
    "however , this result is more general and in case that the rods are trimmed into cantor sets the fd which is observed in this range is equal to the fd of the single cantor set .",
    "the distinction between these two ranges of length scales applies for a very broad class of systems which exhibit nucleation of a finite density of fractal - like clusters .",
    "the majority of spatial fractals in the physics literature belong to this class @xcite .",
    "a finite density of fractal - like clusters appears in models such as diffusion - limited - cluster - cluster - aggregation @xcite and in experimental systems such as molecular beam epitaxy where diffusion - limited - aggregation - like clusters nucleate at a finite density @xcite . in these systems",
    "the fractal - like structure of the clusters results from complex stochastic dynamics .",
    "the cluster density is determined by parameters such as the temperature and deposition rate .",
    "the typical distribution is not exactly poissonian due to effective repulsion between clusters .",
    "however , the distinction , emphasized here , between smaller length scales where the fractal properties are dominated by the single cluster and larger length scales where the distribution is dominant still applies .",
    "we thus predict that experiments involving random distributions of fractal - like objects , will reveal a cross - over from object - dominated to distribution - dominated fractal behavior .",
