    "hospitals throughout the world are facing a unique problem , as the aged population is increased , health - care population is decreased .",
    "telecommunication community is not doing much work in the field of medicine however , there is a need of remote patient monitoring technology . to fulfill this task , it is required to build communication network between an external interface and portable sensor devices worn on and implemented within the body of the user which can be done by basns .",
    "basns is not only useful for remote patient monitoring , but can also establishes within the hospitals ; like in operation theaters and intensive care units",
    ". it would enhance patient comfort as well as provide ease to doctors and nurses to perform their work efficiently .",
    "ban is used for connecting body to wireless devices and finds applications in various areas such as entertainment , defense forces and sports .",
    "the basic step in building any wireless device is to study the transmission channel and to model it accurately .",
    "channel modeling is a technique that has been initiated by a group of researchers throughout the world [ 1 ] .",
    "they have studied path loss and performed measurement campaigns for wireless node on the body [ 2 - 8 ] .",
    "some researchers have taken into account , the implanted devices which are the area of ban called as intra - body communication [ 9 ] .",
    "for the short range low data rate communication in ban , measurement groups have considered ultra - wide band ( uwb ) as the appropriate air interface .",
    "the models developed by measurement campaigns are only path loss models and do not provide any description of propagation channel .",
    "it is important to study the propagation mechanism of radio waves on and inside the body in order to develop an accurate ban channel model .",
    "this study will show the underlying propagation characteristics .",
    "it would help in the development of ban transceivers which are much suited to the body environment .",
    "for a given position of the transmitter on or inside the body it is required to find out the electromagnetic field on or inside the body for a ban channel model .",
    "this is quite a critical problem that requires a large amount of computational power .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to derive an analytical expression which will perform this objective . in short",
    "this determines which propagation mechanism takes place , that is reflection , diffraction and transmission [ 10 ] .",
    "an appropriate method of doing this task is by using dyadic green s function .",
    "the solution of canonical problems , such as cylinder , multi layer and sphere have been solved in electro magnetic ( em ) theory , using dyadic green s functions [ 11 - 13 ] .",
    "recently , wbasns shows potential due to increasing application in medical health care . in wbasns , each sensor in the body sends it s data to antenna , both sensors and antenna are worn directly on the body .",
    "examples include sensors which can measure brain activity , blood pressure , body movement and automatic emergency calls .",
    "we require simple and generic body area propagation models to develop efficient and low power radio systems near the human body . to achieve better performance and reliability",
    ", wave propagation needs to be modeled correctly .",
    "few studies have focused on analytic model of propagation around a cylinder ( as human body resembles a cylinder ) using different functions .",
    "these functions involve mathieu function , dyadic green s function , maxwell s equations , finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) and uniform theory of diffraction ( utd ) .",
    "some of these approaches have already proven effective for evaluating body area communication system proposals .",
    "finite difference time domain had successfully measured the communication scenarios .",
    "complete ultra - wide band models have been developed using measurements and simulations , however they do not consider the physical propagation mechanism .",
    "so , the researchers have to rely on ad - hoc modeling approaches which can result in less accurate propagation trends and inappropriate modeling choices [ 14 , 15 ] .",
    "uniform theory of diffraction depends on a ray tracing mechanism allowing propagation channel to be explained in terms of ray diffraction around the body .",
    "it typically based on high - frequency approximations which is not valid for low frequencies , also not useful when antenna is very close to the body [ 16 ] .",
    "a generic approach is proposed to understand the body area propagation by considering the body as a lossy cylinder and antenna as a point source by using maxwell s equation . a solution for a line source near lossy cylinder",
    "is derived using addition theorem of hankel functions then the line source is converted into the point source by taking inverse fourier transform .",
    "the model accurately predicts the path loss model and can be extended to all frequencies and polarities but this is limited in scope and not always physically motivated [ 17 ] .",
    "mathieu functions are also used for body area propagation model .",
    "the human body is treated as a lossy dielectric elliptic cylinder with infinite length and a small antenna is treated as three - dimensional ( 3-d ) polarized point source .",
    "first the three - dimensional problem of cylinder is resolved into 2-d problem by using fourier transform and then this can be expanded in terms of eigen functions in cylindrical coordinates . by using mathieu function exact expression of electric field distribution near the human body is deduced [ 18 ] .    the propagation characteristics of cylindrical shaped human body have been derived using dyadic green s functions .",
    "the model includes the cases of transmitter and receiver presents either inside or outside of the body and also provides simulation plots of electric field with different values of angle @xmath0 .",
    "all the above proposals describe the propagation characteristics of cylindrically shaped human model [ 19 ] .",
    "we have developed a simple but generic approach to body area propagation derived from dyadic green s function ( dgf ) .",
    "this approach is for arm motion of human body . when the human arm is moved in @xmath1 direction , propagation characteristics of spherical shaped",
    "have been derived using dgf .",
    "first , we use spherical vector eigen functions for finding the scattering superposition .",
    "four cases are considered for either transmitter or receiver is located inside or outside the body .",
    "finally , simulated results of electric field distribution with different values of angle have shown .",
    "in this paper , spherical symmetry is used to represent in and around the arm of the human body . a point on body is a sensor , denoted by x which represents ( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 ) coordinates in the spherical coordinate system and @xmath5 is the location of transmitting antenna .",
    "( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 ) are unit vectors along radial , angle of elevation from z - axis and azimuthal angle from x - axis as shown in figure 1 .",
    "let @xmath6 be electric field at point @xmath7 due to current source @xmath8 .",
    "the general formula for electric field can be written as :    @xmath9    @xmath10 is volume of source , @xmath11 is the current source , @xmath12 is the dyadic green s function @xmath13 is the radian frequency of transmission and @xmath14 is magmatic permeability of the medium .",
    "a dyadic green s function is a type of function used to solve inhomogeneous differential equations subject to specific initial conditions or boundary condition .",
    "as we are considering arm motion of human body , so spherical symmetry is used by taking shoulder as center . for this , spherical eigen functions are used to write the dyadic green s function .",
    "dyadic green s function is basically depends on the spherical vector eigen functions [ 14 ] .",
    "these eigen functions are @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wave number of medium , @xmath19 is an integer , @xmath20 is a real number and @xmath7 is a point in space .",

    "vector eigen functions can be written in this form ,    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40      in scattering problems , it is desirable to determine an unknown scattered field that is due to a known incident field . using the principle of scattering superposition we can write dyadic green s equation as superposition of direct wave and scattering wave . in figure 2 ,",
    "concept of scattering superposition is shown in which there is a sensor located inside the arm of body considered as sphere .",
    "the sensor transmits the wave to antenna which is divided in two parts as direct wave and scattered wave .",
    "the direct wave is considered as wave directly transmits from sensor to transmitter and scattered wave is composed of reflection and transmission waves .",
