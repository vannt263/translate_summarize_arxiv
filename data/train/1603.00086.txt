    "chondritic meteorites can be regarded as a fossil record of how the solar system formed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most invaluable records are contained in chondrules , which are the most abundant ingredient in chondrites .",
    "chondrules are millimeter - sized spherical particles that are formed as the consequence of transient heating events occurring in the solar nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since such events may be relevant to important processes regulating the nebula evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , investigating chondrule formation can shed light on the origins of the solar system .",
    "chondrites themselves also possess profound information .",
    "it is widely accepted that chondrites are fragments of planetesimals originating from the asteroid belt ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "taking into account the consideration that planetesimals are the building blocks of planets , understanding of how chondrites are generated from their parent bodies can provide fundamental insight into the time evolution of the asteroid belt , planetesimal formation , and even ( perhaps ) the formation of ( exo)planetary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "significant progress has recently been made on chondrule formation and accretion .",
    "for instance , @xcite have produced a pioneering work in which planetesimal collisions and the resultant impact jetting are proposed as a mechanism of chondrule formation .",
    "they have found that ejected materials from the collisional surface can reproduce the thermal history of chondrules , and the collisional frequency during planetary accretion is high enough to account for the present asteroid belt mass ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , an experimental study revealed that primitive chondrites and the chondrules embedded in them can retain the information of the magnetic field strength of the solar nebula @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have performed numerical simulations and shown that gas drag acting on pebbles can substantially accelerate the growth of massive bodies due to the efficient accretion of pebbles onto the bodies ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this process can be viewed as a mechanism of chondrule accretion onto parent bodies of chondrites @xcite .    here",
    "we synthesize these recent steps on chondrule formation and accretion , and explore how impact jetting and subsequent pebble accretion can be consistent with the meteorite conditions .",
    "we show below that the coupling of these processes with the meteorite data can provide tight constraints on the mass of the solar nebula at @xmath1 au and the size of parent bodies of chondrites in the solar nebula .",
    "we will therefore conclude that both impact jetting and pebble accretion are intriguing processes for obtaining some valuable clues about the origins of the solar system .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we adopt the minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn ) model @xcite , which can be given as ( see table [ table1 ] for the definition of variables ) , @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a factor to examine the effect of disk mass on chondrule formation , and @xmath9 is derived under the optically thin limit . based on the above equations , we can obtain the following ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 where the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium is assumed and the mean molecular weight is taken as 2.3 in units of atomic hydrogen .",
    "we adopt a stellar mass of @xmath12 .",
    "we consider impact jetting as one of the primary processes for generating chondrules which can occur during planetary accretion .",
    "for this case , the resultant abundance of chondrules can be characterized well by @xmath13 as long as formed protoplanets can reach @xmath14 within a given disk lifetime @xcite . may be a lower limit because it is derived only from vertical impacts , with a conservative estimate of the threshold impact velocity @xcite . ]",
    "this formula is obtained because chondrule - forming collisions can be realized when protoplanets undergo oligarchic growth and acquire most of their masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    the total abundance of chondrules for @xmath15 can be readily computed as ( see @xcite for a complete discussion and references ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 equation ( [ eq : m_ij ] ) assumes that protoplanets are separated by their feeding zones ( @xmath18 ) with each other , and that chondrules were formed over a time interval @xmath19 . since meteorite records indicate that chondrule formation began around the time of cai formation and continued for @xmath20 years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "produced by impact jetting via planetary accretion at @xmath31 au as a function of @xmath8 ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath32 varies from @xmath33 g ( top ) to @xmath34 g ( bottom ) . for comparison purposes ,",
    "both the primordial and the present asteroid belt masses are plotted as the horizontal dotted lines .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath8 above which @xmath30 is large enough to reproduce the required abundance of chondrules increases with increasing @xmath32 ( see the vertical dotted line).,width=302 ]    figure [ fig1 ] shows the resultant value of @xmath30 as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the value of @xmath32 varies from @xmath33 g to @xmath34 g in each panel , in order to examine its dependence on @xmath30 ( see equation ( [ eq : e_oli ] ) ) .",
    "the results show that @xmath30 is very low for small values of @xmath8 , and it rises suddenly as @xmath8 increases ( see the vertical dotted line ) .",
    "this occurs because a disk becomes massive enough at that time , so that a growing protoplanet at @xmath35 au can reach @xmath14 within given values of @xmath19 .",
    "once @xmath8 exceeds these critical values , the increment of @xmath30 becomes gradual until other sudden jumps in @xmath30 appear .",
    "these jumps originate from an additional contribution arising from another protoplanet that can now reach @xmath14 within @xmath19 by increasing @xmath8 .",
    "note that this secondly formed protoplanet is separated from the first formed protoplanet by @xmath36 au .",
    "the results also show that the first sudden rises of @xmath30 require a higher value of @xmath8 as @xmath32 increases ( see the vertical dotted line on each panel in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is a simple reflection of @xmath23 that is an increasing function of @xmath32 ( see equations ( [ eq : tau_ij ] ) , ( [ eq : dmdt ] ) , and ( [ eq : e_oli ] ) ) ; when massive planetesimals are involved in planetary accretion , the value of @xmath29 becomes higher , since the eccentricity damping by the disk gas becomes less effective .",
    "then , the growth rate of a protoplanet slows down . as a result",
    ", a higher value of @xmath8 is needed to accelerate the formation of protoplanets , in order to satisfy the condition that protoplanets obtain @xmath14 within @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the abundance of chondrules formed by impact jetting through planetesimal collisions is very likely significant enough to reproduce the present asteroid belt mass ; for given values of @xmath19 , the formation of protoplanets at @xmath37 au generates a large amount of chondrules for reasonable values of @xmath8 and @xmath32 .",
    "this finding is consistent with the previous studies @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is obvious that the results degenerate for certain ranges of @xmath8 and @xmath32 .",
    "we will determine the ranges in these two quantities below , using further constraints from meteorite measurements .",
    "magnetic fields can play an important role in evolution of circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of these fields in the solar nebula is supported by measurements of the semarkona ordinary chondrite @xcite . in fu",
    "et al s experiment , the thermoremanent magnetization of chondrules in the chondrite and the direction of magnetic fields are measured simultaneously .",
    "these measurements suggest that some chondrules in this sample very likely recorded the magnetic field strength that they experienced well before being accreted by their parent body . in other words ,",
    "the data trace the magnetic field strength of the solar nebula around the chondrule - forming region , which is @xmath38 mg .",
    "this information is of fundamental importance for characterizing the strength of turbulence in the nebula , which can be computed as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the radial and the azimuthal components of magnetic fields , respectively , and the famous @xmath42-prescription is adopted to label the turbulent strength @xcite .",
    "we will use the resultant value of @xmath43 ( and @xmath44 ) below .",
    "pebble accretion is a promising candidate process for forming the chondrite parent bodies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this case ,",
    "the vertical scale heights of chondrules ( @xmath45 ) and the planetesimals that accrete them ( @xmath46 ) are important for determining the accretion efficiency .",
    "specifically , pebble accretion is most efficient for planetesimals with a scale height @xmath47 , namely , when they lie among the pebbles @xcite .",
    "we assume this holds in the following .",
    "note that @xmath19 ( @xmath48 years ) is longer than the timescale at which a steady state of @xmath46 is achieved , which is less than @xmath49 years @xcite .",
    "chondrules are typically about 1 mm in size , and large enough to settle toward the midplane due to stellar gravity . in addition",
    ", the solar nebula is very likely turbulent , which diffuses chondrules vertically .",
    "based on equation ( [ eq : alpha_eff ] ) , @xmath50 for @xmath51 at @xmath52 au .",
    "this is a manifestation that shows that magnetic field can play an important role in the solar nebula . as a result",
    ", @xmath45 can be determined by the balance between stirring and settling .",
    "then , @xmath45 can be written as @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 this formula is consistent with other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and mhd simulations show that this approach works well for turbulent regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the planetesimals ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "an eccentricity pump - up by a protoplanet is very likely to dominate over the effect of the random torque caused by turbulence in the solar nebula .",
    "this is because @xmath55 for the former , while @xmath56 for the latter , given that @xmath57 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case , @xmath58 under the assumption that the planetesimals random motions reach equipartition between eccentricity and inclination .",
    "note that @xmath46 depends both on @xmath8 and on @xmath32 ( see equation ( [ eq : e_oli ] ) ) .",
    "then , we can find out the minimum value of magnetic fields ( @xmath59 ) above which pebbles are stirred enough to make their accretion efficient by equating @xmath45 with @xmath46 ( using equation ( [ eq : alpha_eff ] ) ) ; @xmath60 thus , we can compare @xmath59 with that derived from the chondrite ( see section [ mod_const ] ) .    ) threading the solar nebula , which is needed to achieve efficient chondrule accretion onto planetesimals , as a function of @xmath8 ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath32 varies on each panel ( as figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the vertical dashed line denotes a critical value of @xmath8 above which chondrule accretion onto planetesimals is not realized . coupling with the constraint derived from the chondrule abundance ( see the vertical dotted line , which is identical to the one in figure [ fig1 ] ) ,",
    "the results show that all the requirements inferred from the currently available meteoritic samples can be met when @xmath61 and @xmath62 g at @xmath63 au ( see the hatched region).,width=302 ]    figure [ fig2 ] shows the results of @xmath59 as a function of both @xmath8 and @xmath32 .",
    "the calculations are done at @xmath64 au , because this is where the main contribution to form chondrules occurs ( see section [ mod_ij ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath59 increases with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "this trend can be understood as the following . as",
    "a disk becomes more massive ( a higher value of @xmath8 ) , the value of @xmath14 also becomes higher .",
    "this in turn pumps up the planetesimals eccentricities ( @xmath29 ) and their scale heights ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "consequently , a higher value of @xmath59 is needed to fulfill the condition that @xmath65 . for the dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath59 ( see each panel ) ,",
    "the results show that when massive planetesimals are considered , the required value of @xmath59 becomes higher for a given value of @xmath8 .",
    "this is simply because @xmath46 is an increasing function of @xmath32 ; the eccentricity damping by the disk gas becomes weaker for massive planetesimals ( see equation ( [ eq : e_oli ] ) ) . as a result , @xmath59 should be stronger in order to expand the pebble sea for the vertical direction to catch up with the increment of @xmath46 by increasing @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the coupling of pebble accretion with the dynamics of planetesimals that is regulated by growing protoplanets enables an estimate of magnetic fields that are needed to achieve efficient pebble accretion in the system .",
    "we are now in a position to derive new constraints on the solar nebula and parent bodies of chondrites , under the assumption that impact jetting and subsequent pebble accretion play a dominant role in forming the bodies .    based on the discussion in section [ mod_ij ] , a lower limit of @xmath8",
    "is obtained .",
    "above this limit both the abundance of chondrules and their formation timescales are consistent with the meteoritic data ( see the vertical dotted line in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath66 comes from comparing @xmath59 with the magnetic fields inferred from semarkona ( see the vertical dashed line in figure [ fig2 ] , also see section [ mod_peb ] ) . in the end",
    ", the most likely values of @xmath8 can be specified as a function of @xmath32 ( see the hatched region in figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it is important that the hatched region shrinks as @xmath32 increases , and it eventually disappears for the case in which @xmath67 g.    our results therefore demonstrate that the combination of impact jetting with pebble accretion can satisfy all the currently available meteoritic data when the solar nebula is @xmath0 times more massive than the mmsn at @xmath1 au and parent bodies of chondrite are @xmath2 g in the solar nebula .",
    "so far we have assumed that chondrules generated from forming protoplanets via impact jetting are accreted by the surrounding field planetesimals as long as @xmath47 . what happens if the condition that @xmath47 is not satisfied ?",
    "for this case , it is expected that the majority of chondrules will be accreted by the protoplanets and/or the central star . in the current asteroid belt , chondrules are apparently ubiquitous . in addition , protoplanets are too large to be disrupted to form asteroids .",
    "furthermore , it is obvious that smaller planetesimals collectively have a larger surface area than more massive bodies @xcite .",
    "thus , it is necessary that ( at least ) some fractions of chondrules should be accreted by small planetesimals .",
    "our results can be compatible with several previous findings .",
    "@xcite suggest that the planetesimals originally at the asteroid belt s location were at least 50 km in radius .",
    "this planetesimal radius or even a higher value ( up to 500 km in radius ) is needed to reproduce a bump observed at the planetesimal radius of @xmath68 km in the size distribution of the current asteroid belt .",
    "in addition , @xcite have recently shown that planetesimals with a characteristic radius of @xmath69 km can experience efficient pebble accretion within @xmath70 years . since planetesimals that are smaller than @xmath71 km in radius can be generated as fragments of larger bodies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their results may provide a lower limit of parent bodies mass .",
    "if this is the case , coupling of our results with theirs enables the identification of a certain range of @xmath32 for primordial asteroids .",
    "furthermore , a higher value of @xmath72 is consistent with the finding derived from the standard core accretion picture applied to the solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the populations of exoplanets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; more massive disks than the mmsn are required to form jupiter and saturn .",
    "another important implication derived from our results may be the mass segregation of parent bodies in terms of chondrule inclusion . in our scenario ,",
    "the presence of a first generation of planetesimals is needed both for impact jetting and for pebble accretion .",
    "then , the resultant constraint on parent bodies size may imply that chondrules might have had less of a chance to be accreted by primordial asteroids that were @xmath73 km in radius , while smaller primordial asteroids likely had a surface layer in which chondrules were abundant .",
    "it is also interesting that the new constraint on @xmath74 g ) is roughly comparable to the mass of vesta / ceres .",
    "a careful examination of vesta / ceres may lead to acquisition of further clues about our scenario .",
    "it is clear that a more detailed investigation is needed to verify the picture discussed here .",
    "for instance , our scenario requires a first generation of planetesimals as discussed above .",
    "possible mechanisms to form such planetesimals ( i.e. , streaming instabilities , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should be further explored in this context . also , detailed studies of how the resultant chondrules can be accreted onto planetesimals under the presence of a protoplanet should be undertaken .",
    "one of the key steps may be to perform numerical simulations that treat the random torque on protoplanets from turbulent disks , which may affect how and where chondrules form and accrete .",
    "finally , our current setup is local , that is , it is isolated entirely from its surrounding .",
    "it is important to examine how the picture developed here can be affected by the presence of nearby planets such as jupiter .",
    "these kind of global simulations may show how our scenario could favor or disfavor the grand - tack scenario @xcite , which proposes that a mixture of volatile - rich and volatile - poor asteroids in the current asteroid belt may have originated from gas - induced migration of jupiter and saturn .",
    "in the next few years , potential sample - return missions and laboratory studies should yield a broader and deeper view of the history recorded in primitive asteroids .",
    "this will enable tests of the ideas that chondrules formed through impact jetting , cooled in the asteroid belt s ambient magnetic field , and were quickly swept up by planetesimals with the aid of gas drag forces .",
