    "the low - temperature properties of alkali halides may be significantly modified by the presence of substitutional impurities , such as li , cn , or oh . already a few ppm of these defects totally change the thermal behavior and the elastic and dielectric response below helium temperature .",

    "[ spectrum ] , the energy spectrum contains four equidistant levels ; the upper and lower ones , a@xmath17 and a@xmath18 , are single quantum states , whereas the middle levels t@xmath19 and t@xmath20 are threefold degenerate .",
    "this groundstate multiplet can be described as the direct product of three two - level systems with energy splitting @xmath4 .",
    "each energy eigenstate is a superposition of states @xmath21 localized at the eight impurity positions @xmath22 with the effective two - state coordinates @xmath23 . for a lithium impurity ,",
    "the off - center positions @xmath24 form a cube of side - length @xmath25 , whereas for cyanide impurities @xmath24 indicates the orientation of the cigar - shaped polar molecule . due to quantum tunneling along the axes @xmath26 , the energy eigenstates factorize as @xmath27 , where the variables @xmath28 label odd and even superpositions @xmath29 along the @xmath30-axis .",

    "we have @xmath35 [ e6 ] @xmath36 thus a lithium or cyanide impurity is described as the product of three two - state variables .",
    "we adopt the shorthand notation for its quantum operators @xmath37 where @xmath26 label the crystal axes and greek indices @xmath38 the pseudospin operators .",
    "when denoting by @xmath39 the tunneling amplitude between adjacent impurity positions , we obtain the hamiltonian @xmath40 its eigenstates may be labelled according to the eigenvalues @xmath41 of @xmath42 ; for example , the ground state a@xmath17 reads as @xmath43+++@xmath44 , and the states of the triplet level t@xmath19 as @xmath45++@xmath44 , @xmath43+@xmath46+@xmath44 , and @xmath43++@xmath47 . according to the above discussion , the statistical operator @xmath48 factorizes as @xmath49 ( in the limit of zero temperature",

    "the full line is a fit including asymmetry effects ( [ chiasy2 ] ) where we used the parameters given in table 1 .",
    "the temperature where the maximum occurs depends strongly on the tunneling amplitude @xmath4 and the fraction @xmath165 ; the maximum value of @xmath2 varies with the prefactor and the asymmetry width as far as the mean splitting is bigger than the frequency @xmath228 .",
    "the relaxation peak arises where the external frequency is comparable to the slow rate @xmath141 , and @xmath229 is determined by the relation @xmath230 .",
    "thus the exponential decrease of @xmath141 is essential for the existence of the relaxation maximum .",
    "note that this mechanism does not exist for two - level tunneling systems , even with large asymmetries , since their relaxation rate tends towards a constant @xmath163 . as a consequence , for",
    "@xmath231 the relaxation maximum is suppressed by a factor @xmath165 , and the internal friction of a two - level system is by two orders of magnitude smaller than that obtained for the [ 111]-impurity model .",
    "note that the parameters gathered in table 1 result in a rate constant @xmath232  sec@xmath233 which is indeed much larger than the frequency @xmath234  sec@xmath233 . for systems with @xmath235 the peak is suppressed by @xmath236 ( see eq.([plo2 ] ) ) which means that the peak contribution stems from systems with small asymmetries .",
    "therefore the peak in the internal friction data determines only a combination of the prefactor and the asymmetry width .",
    "our simple model accounts well for position and height of the peak and for its shape close to the maximum .",
    "yet it strongly underestimates the wings at temperatures well above and below @xmath237 . as to the excess spectral weight observed at low temperatures , a more realistic distribution of asymmetry energies",
    "would probably give a better agreement than the gaussian used in ( [ chiasy2 ] ) .",
    "the additional peak at about 2  k may well be due to strongly coupled pairs .",
    "now we turn to the relative change of sound velocity as shown in figure [ soundvel ] .",
    "the triangles are data for the 45 ppm sample .",
    "the dashed line is a fit without asymmetry , given by ( [ e60 ] ) , and the full line with asymmetry ( [ chiasy1 ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry distribution with width @xmath69 merely smears out the temperature dependence .",
    "thus the fit of fig .",
    "[ soundvel ] mainly depends on the tunneling amplitude and the prefactor but it hardly varies with the relaxation rate and the asymmetry width .",

    "the transverse deformation potential is the most relevant parameter that determines both the absolute values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the relaxation maximum of the latter ; we find the value @xmath3  ev .",
    "( note the factor 2 in our definition of the phonon coupling ( [ e12 ] ) . )",
    "the width of the relaxation peak of @xmath2 and the low - temperature wing indicate the relevance of the asymmetry energies ( [ asymmetrie ] ) .",
    "the poor quality of our fit at low @xmath73 may well be due to the choice of a gaussian distribution for the asymmetries .",
    "nonetheless , our results confirm that for the 45 ppm sample , the mean asymmetry is by two orders of magnitude smaller than the tunnel energy , which is consistent with the model assumptions .    the present theory accounts fairly well for available data on the relaxation behavior of [ 111]-impurities in alkali halides investigated with @xmath8-modes , in particular with respect to the temperature dependence . yet the multiexpenontial decay with the two rates @xmath140 and @xmath141 gives rise to quite an intricate relaxation spectrum ; thus an experimental investigation of the frequency dependence would seem most promising .",
    "a simliar behaviour was also found for an @xmath12-mode @xcite contradicting the simplest model of an [ 111]-defect .",
    "even asymmetries can not explain this feature in a simple way .",
    "another open question concerns the thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "the relaxation feature obtained in the present work should significantly contribute to thermal resistivity at low t. still , the spectrum of the defects obtained from the data @xcite suggests a more complicated elastic response spectrum and may well require large asymmetry energies .    another interesting point would be to extend the present work to the case of strong doping ; this is certainly not an easy taks , given the serious difficulties encountered already in the treatment of interacting two - state systems ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite . ) note , however , that our sound velocity data in fig .",

    "we briefly summarize the main results .",

    "\\(iii ) comparison with recent data on kcl : cn proves the relevance of this relaxation mechanism .",
    "the exponentially decreasing rate @xmath141 explains the large amplitude of the relaxation peak shown by the external friction @xmath2 as a function of temperature at @xmath245 khz . by the same token",
    ", our model provides a good description for the hump in the sound velocity .",
    "\\(iv ) the prefactors of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the relaxation rates are related by the values for the deformation potential @xmath59 , sound velocity @xmath246 , and mass density @xmath89 . by taking @xmath59 as a free parameter",
    ", we obtain for reasonable values of @xmath59 ( compared with simliar materials ) satisfying fits for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , involving both absolute values and the temperature dependencies .",

    ", the low - temperature rate tends towards a constant and thus may exceed @xmath243 at any @xmath73 , whereas the small rate @xmath141 of a [ 111]-impurity inevitably meets @xmath243 at some @xmath73 and gives rise to a relaxation peak .",
