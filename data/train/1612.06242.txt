    "a better prediction of the dynamics of surface water waves would be of great practical and theoretical relevance .",
    "one need only think of the development of efficient early warning systems for tsunamis .",
    "the mathematical analysis of water waves has a long history of more than 300 years . over the last two decades",
    "the further development of the mathematical theory of water waves has attracted new and increasing interest leading to significant progress .",
    "nevertheless , there are still many challenging open problems being both relevant for practical applications and stimulating for the development of new subtle mathematical concepts .",
    "this article provides a survey on some main results and recent developments in the modern mathematical theory of water waves .",
    "since the existing literature is very extensive , a short survey article on the water  wave theory can not be exhaustive .",
    "hence , we refer for further information to the historical articles @xcite , the surveys @xcite , the books @xcite and the references therein .",
    "mathematically , water waves are modeled by the navier  stokes or euler s equations with some free unknown top surface . usually viscosity and compressibility",
    "can be neglected such that the incompressible euler s equations are chosen .",
    "the resulting mathematical model is called the water wave problem .    moreover , in many practically relevant problems , it is sufficient to study the water wave problem only in two dimensions ",
    "one for the height and one for the direction of the propagation of the wave  to get a realistic description of the problems .",
    "for example , if an earthquake happens in a crack along a continent it creates almost parallel initial conditions for tsunamis .    in the next section",
    ", we discuss the water wave problem in more detail , and in section [ sec3 ] , we give an overview of local and global well  posedness results for the model equations .",
    "since the water wave problem is a nonlinear free boundary problem , its analysis is extremely difficult . a qualitative understanding of the solutions to the water wave problem being usable for practical applications does not seem within reach for the near future , neither analytically nor numerically .",
    "therefore , it is important to approximate the full model by suitable reduced model equations whose solutions have similar qualitative properties as the solutions of the original model equations .",
    "the simplest reduced model equation is the linear wave equation , which is helpful to explain many linear wave phenomena .",
    "the most famous nonlinear reduced model equations are the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) equation and the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation .",
    "all these reduced model equations can be derived by multiple scaling analysis as formal approximation equations in certain parameter regimes in order to describe the motion of typical waves like , for example , solitary waves .    to understand to",
    "which extent such reduced models make correct predictions about the dynamics of the solutions to the full water wave problem it is important to justify the validity of the reduced models mathematically rigorously by proving error estimates between exact solutions of the full model and their formal approximations obtained via the reduced models , where these error estimates should be valid on the physically relevant length and time scales .    in section 4 , we present various reduced models for the motion of water waves and discuss the mathematically rigorous justification of their validity .",
    "we now discuss the water wave problem in more detail . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the 2dimensional case with finite depth of water and a flat bottom .",
    "the modifications for uneven bottoms , for infinite depth of water and for the 3dimensional case are straightforward .",
    "the 2d water wave problem for waves over an incompressible , inviscid fluid in an infinitely long canal of finite depth under the influence of gravity and surface tension has in eulerian coordinates the following form : the fluid fills a domain @xmath0 in between the bottom @xmath1 and the free top surface @xmath2 .",
    "the velocity field @xmath3 of the fluid is governed by the incompressible euler s equations @xmath4   \\nabla \\cdot v & =   0 \\qquad \\text{in}\\,\\ , \\omega(t ) , \\label{incompr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the pressure and @xmath6 the constant of gravity .",
    "assuming that fluid particles on the top surface remain on the top surface , that the pressure at the top surface is determined by the laplace  young jump condition and that the bottom is impermeable yields the boundary conditions",

    "if the flow is additionally assumed to be irrotational , the above system can be reduced to a system defined on @xmath10 . due to the irrotationality of the motion",
    "there exists a velocity potential @xmath11 with @xmath12 , which is harmonic in @xmath13 with vanishing normal derivative at @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the motion of the vertical component of the velocity is uniquely determined by the horizontal one , i.e. , there exists an operator @xmath15 such that @xmath16 the operator @xmath17 is related to the dirichlet to neumann operator .    by using the potential @xmath11 , the system ( [ euler])([bot ] )",

    "choosing eulerian coordinates to formulate the equations for the motion of water waves is natural for describing many physical experiments .",
    "however , for surface waves which can not be described by a graph using eulerian coordinates is not so convenient .",
    "but there are also alternative coordinate systems which yield appropriate frameworks for the formulation the water wave problem .",
    "each of these coordinate systems has its own advantages concerning applicability and mathematical structure of the resulting equations of the water wave problem .",
    "hence , depending on the problem one wants to solve , one has to find out which coordinate system is the most adapted one . in the following ,",
    "we give an overview of the most important coordinate systems which are used to formulate the water wave problem .    the second classical formulation of the water wave problem bases on lagrangian coordinates . in these coordinates ,",
    "the free top surface is parametrized as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are the eulerian coordinates of the fluid particle labeled by @xmath24 .",
    "this parametrization is well  defined due to the above assumption that fluid particles on the top surface remain on the top surface .",
    "we have @xmath25 such that implies @xmath26 one advantage of this equation is that the transport term @xmath27 has disappeared .    assuming , , and the irrotationality of the flow , the dynamics of the fluid is again completely determined by the evolution of the free surface . in the literature , there are various evolutionary systems for the free surface derived from , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "another formulation of the 2d water wave problem is the so - called arc length formulation , where the free top surface is parametrized by arc length .",
    "this formulation was introduced in the theory of the 2d water wave problem by ambrose and masmoudi @xcite , influenced by the numerical work of hou , lowengrub and shelley @xcite .",
    "let @xmath28 be a parametrization of @xmath10 by arc length .",
    "hence , we have @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be the normal and the tangential velocity field of the free top surface measured in the coordinates of the arc length parametrization , that means that @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the upward unit normal vectors and the unit tangential vectors to the free top surface and @xmath35 are the tangent angles on the free top surface",
    ". then @xmath31 satisfies @xmath36 integrating this relation determines the tangential velocity @xmath31 in depending on @xmath37 and @xmath30 up to a constant .",
    "since arc length parametrizations are invariant under translations , this constant can be set to @xmath38 without loss of generality .",
    "this implies @xmath39 the normal velocity @xmath30 is governed by the incompressible euler s equations ( [ euler])([incompr ] ) and the boundary conditions ( [ surf])([bot ] ) . for irrotational flows",
    "the normal velocity @xmath30 can be expressed as a function of the physical tangential velocity @xmath40 of the fluid particles on the free top surface , whose evolution is determined by ( [ euler ] ) .",
    "then , using all the above information , one can derive the following closed evolutionary system : @xmath41 { v}_{t } & = & - { y}_{\\alpha } + b { \\theta}_{{\\alpha}\\ , { \\alpha } } -   { \\delta } { \\delta}_{{\\alpha } } + u { \\theta}_{t}\\ , , \\label{vtilde}\\\\[2 mm ] \\theta_{t } & = & u_{\\alpha }   - { t } { \\theta}_{{\\alpha}}\\ , , \\label{thetatilde}\\\\[2 mm ] { \\delta}_{{\\alpha}\\ , t } & = & -   { c}{\\theta}_{{\\alpha } } + b { \\theta}_{{\\alpha}\\,{\\alpha}\\,{\\alpha } } -   ( { \\delta}{\\delta}_{{\\alpha}})_{{\\alpha } } + ( u_{\\alpha}+ v { \\theta}_{{\\alpha}})^{2}\\ , , \\label{deltaalphatilde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 @xmath43 the equations and are included because they have better regularity properties than the evolution equations for the spatial derivatives of @xmath44 and @xmath40 .",
    "the main advantage of this evolutionary system is that in the case with surface tension , i.e. , with @xmath45 , the term with the most derivatives in  is linear .",
    "the analogon of the arc length formulation in the case of the 3d water wave problem is the use of isothermal coordinates , see @xcite .",
    "a further possibility to formulate the 2d  water wave problem is to express the evolution equations in holomorphic coordinates . in doing so",
    ", one has to choose a conformal parametrization of @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , it is convenient to extend the functions @xmath47 and @xmath11 holomorphically .",
    "this formulation was first used by nalimov @xcite and ovsjannikov @xcite and further developed by dyachenko , kuznetsov , spector and zakharov @xcite , wu @xcite as well as recently by harrop ",
    "griffiths , hunter , ifrim and tataru @xcite .",
    "an essential advantage of holomorphic coordinates is that in these coordinates the dirichlet to neumann operator is given in terms of the hilbert transform in case of infinite depth of water and in terms of the operator @xmath48 with the symbol @xmath49 for @xmath50 in case of finite depth of water .",
    "an alternative approach to formulate the water wave problem is to derive an abstract coordinate independent evolutionary system for differential geometric quantities related to the evolving free surface like , for example , its mean curvature .",
    "such a system involves differential geometric operators like , for example , the surface laplace  beltrami operator and the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "this geometric approach was chosen by shatah and zeng @xcite and for a related problem also by beyer and gnther @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the fact that the solutions of  can be interpreted as the geodesic flow with respect to the potential energy , the kinetic energy and in case of surface tension also the surface energy on the infinite dimensional riemannian manifold of volume  preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath51 . in this variational framework ,",
    "the boundary conditions  appear as natural boundary conditions .",
    "the interpretation of the incompressible euler s equation as the geodesic equation on the infinite dimensional manifold of volume  preserving diffeomorphisms was first given by arnold @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of a coordinate independent formulation of the water wave problem is that it allows one to switch between different coordinate systems .",
    "there are many papers on the local well  posedness of the water wave problem . for analytical initial data ,",
    "local well  posedness of the 2d  water wave problem with finite depth of water and without surface tension was proven in holomorphic coordinates by ovsjannikov @xcite , in lagrangian coordinates by shinbrot @xcite and in eulerian coordinates by kano and nishida @xcite .",
    "local well  posedness results for initial data in sobolev spaces were first obtained in lagrangian coordinates . in the case of infinite depth of water ,",

    "they presented the details of the proof for the case of infinite depth , but , as they mentioned in @xcite , the proof works analogously in the case of finite depth .    in holomorphic coordinates ,",

    "having sufficiently small initial data in sobolev spaces was recently proven in eulerian coordinates by wang in the cases without surface tension @xcite and with weak surface tension @xcite , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "the general strategy in all these almost global and global existence proofs is to prove and combine high  order energy estimates and dispersive estimates , where the main difficulties lie in controling the quadratic terms of the evolution equations , handling occurring resonances and finding appropriate norms for the estimates .",
    "for the 2d water wave problem additional difficulties have to be overcome for establishing global existence since the time decay of the solutions is smaller .    this strategy",
    "is implemented with the help of a combination of variants of klainerman s vector fields method @xcite with generalizations of shatah s normal  form transform method @xcite realized in a distinct way by the different authors .",
    "wu constructed an implicit change of coordinates which agrees quadratically with shatah s normal  form transform and is derived by using complex analysis in the two dimensional case and clifford analysis in the three dimensional case .",

    "global existence of solutions to the 2d water wave problem with finite depth of water is still an open problem .",
    "a reason for this is the fact that analogous dispersive estimates as in the case of infinite depth can not be expected because the 2d water wave problem with finite depth posesses solitary waves solutions , which are localized traveling waves of permanent form ; see below .",
    "global existence for arbitrarily large initial data is not true in general since singularities can occur in finite time @xcite .",
    "the most common singularity is of course wave breaking .",
    "however , developing a general theory of wave breaking is still an open problem , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) for further information .",
    "concerning the qualitative behavior of the solutions , the full water wave problem  even in two dimensions  is extremely complicated to analyze such that it is important to approximate it by suitable reduced model equations whose solutions have similar but more easily accessible qualitative properties . in the following , we present various reduced models . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves again to the 2d water wave problem . for the corresponding reduced models for the 3d water wave problem and their properties we refer , for example , to @xcite .",
    "the reduced models which we will present are used to describe the motion of some typical wave profiles occurring in nature , namely , airy waves , stokes waves , cnoidal waves and solitary waves .",
    "each of these wave profiles appears in typical parameter regimes for the ratio of the depth of the water , the wave length and the amplitude of the wave ; see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 15 ) .",
    "the reduced models can be derived by multiple scaling analysis .",
    "first , we make the multiple scaling ansatz @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . inserting this ansatz into  , expanding the operator @xmath58 with respect to @xmath59 and equating the terms with the lowest power of @xmath59 yields that @xmath60 has to satisfy in lowest order with respect to @xmath61 the linear wave equation @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this is the simplest and most used reduced model equation for the water wave problem .",
    "the linear wave equation has solutions of the form @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",

    "the linearized system  has solutions of the form @xmath69 with @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 hence , the generalized linear reduced model  also has airy waves as solutions but now the waves are dispersive , that means that waves with different wave numbers @xmath73 propagate with different velocities @xmath74 determined by the linear dispersion relation @xmath75 which is given by .    in the case of infinite depth of water",
    "the operator @xmath48 has to be replaced by the hilbert transform .",

    "the kdv equation and the kawahara equation can be derived as approximation equations only in the case of finite depth of water since the expansion of the operator @xmath58 with respect to @xmath59 is different for infinite depth of water .",
    "the important point about the kdv equation is that the effects induced by the nonlinear term are in some equilibrium with the dispersive effects , and so the kdv equation has a family of solitary waves , which are spatially localized traveling waves of permanent form , as solutions ; see @xcite . for @xmath87 , shape and propagation behavior of the solitary wave solutions to",

    "the kawahara equation possesses solitary wave solutions at least if @xmath89 ; see @xcite .",
    "the above perturbation analysis suggests that the soliton dynamics of the kdv equation is at least approximately present in the 2d water wave problem .",
    "indeed , solitary waves were observed experimentally in a canal between edinburgh and glasgow by russell in 1834 ; see @xcite .",
    "the full water wave problem also possesses exact solitary wave solutions and exact periodic wave solutions .",
    "the latter are called stokes waves and were first derived by stokes @xcite in 1847 . for an overview of the vast literature about existence results for these types of waves in different parameter regimes and characteristic properties of their profiles as well as the current state of the art concerning their stability properties",

    "in the case of zero surface tension , the first approximation proofs were done by craig @xcite in lagrangian coordinates and by kano and nishida @xcite in eulerian coordinates .",

    "the result of craig admits a least a certain class of initial data in sobolev spaces and is valid on a time interval of order @xmath91 in the original system .",
    "craig s result was improved by schneider and wayne @xcite in the following sense .",

    "even though the resulting normal  form transform loses regularity the structure of the error equations allows us to invert the normal  form transform and express the error equations in terms of the new variable @xmath171 . due to the properties of the lagrangian formulation of the water wave problem",

    "the final nonlinear reduced model we present is the whitham system .",
    "the kdv equation , the nls equation and the whitham system are the three generic modulation equations for dispersive systems like the water wave problem . by inserting the ansatz @xmath174 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 into  , expanding the operator @xmath58 with respect to @xmath59 and equating the terms with the lowest power of @xmath59 , we obtain a nonlinear system of conservation laws of the form @xmath175 where @xmath176 , @xmath177 .",
    "this system is called nonlinear shallow water system or whitham system .",

    "the validity of this reduced model was rigorously justified for the 2d water wave problem without surface tension by ovsjannikov @xcite for analytic initial data and by iguchi @xcite for initial data in sobolev spaces .",
