    "the celebrated proposal of ryu and takyanagi @xcite provides a method to calculate entanglement entropies for field theories that have holographic duals .",
    "originally the proposal was used to calculate the entanglement entropy for theories in their vacuum state , but was quickly generalized to include more general settings , such as finite temperature and time - dependent states ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) . for spherical entangling surfaces",
    "it was observed by casini , huerta and myers @xcite that the holographic entanglement entropy can be mapped to the thermal entropy of a hyperbolic black hole . in the field theory ,",
    "the corresponding entanglement entropy is mapped to the thermal entropy on a hyperbolic space",
    ".    another generalization concerns entanglement entropy in the presence of extended defects , such as wilson lines . in the probe approximation",
    "these defects are described by strings or branes in the @xmath2 space and the backreaction of the stress energy of the branes on the bulk geometry is neglected .",
    "for example , the holographic description of a wilson loop in @xmath3 @xmath4 sym in the fundamental representation is given by a fundamental string in @xmath5 @xcite , whereas higher dimensional representations can be described by d3- ( d5- ) branes with @xmath6 worldvolume in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of entanglement entropy in the presence of probe brane defects .",
    "when the dimension of the representation increases and becomes of order @xmath7 , the backreaction can not be neglected and the probe is replaced by a new bubbling geometry with flux .",
    "the bubbling holographic solutions corresponding to half - bps wilson loops in @xmath4 sym were found in @xcite .    in @xcite , lewkowycz and",
    "maldacena applied the casini , huerta and myers mapping to the calculation of the entanglement entropy in the presence of wilson loops in @xmath4 sym theory and abjm theories @xcite .",
    "they showed that the entanglement entropy can be calculated from the expectation value of the wilson loop operator as well as the one point function of the stress tensor in the presence of the wilson loop .",
    "for bps wilson loops these quantities can be evaluated using localization and reduced to matrix models @xcite . in @xcite by two of the present authors , the holographic entanglement entropy was calculated using the bubbling solution dual to half - bps wilson loops .",
    "it was shown that the result agrees with @xcite when the exact map between matrix model quantities and the supergravity solution , found in @xcite , is applied .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to generalize the holographic calculation of the entanglement entropy to the case of six - dimensional @xmath1 theory with half - bps wilson surfaces present .",
    "the @xmath1 theory can be defined either by a low - energy limit of type iib string theory on an @xmath8 singularity @xcite or by a decoupling limit of @xmath9 coincident m5 branes @xcite . while there exists no simple lagrangian description of this theory due to the presence of tensor fields @xmath10 with self - dual field strength , the holographic dual @xcite",

    "we give a physical interpretation of our result for the entanglement entropy .",
    "first , recall that during the calculation we introduced two separate regulators .",
    "the fg cut - off @xmath98 can be viewed as a regular uv cut - off for a holographic theory with a six - dimensional @xmath15 boundary .",
    "in addition , when performing the integral over the @xmath16 coordinate @xmath132 in ( [ ads3cut ] ) we introduced a cut - off @xmath26 on the @xmath16 radial coordinate @xmath116 in poincare slicing ( [ eq : ads3metric ] ) .",
    "one might be tempted to view @xmath26 as purely an ir cut - off that regulates the infinite volume of the boundary theory .",
    "however , it also has an interpretation as a uv cut - off on the minimal distance to the wilson surface in the boundary theory .",
    "this interpretation is most easily demonstrated by considering the vacuum spacetime .",
    "the map that relates @xmath143 with @xmath15 boundary in ( [ adsmeta ] ) to a metric with @xmath111 boundary @xmath144 is given by @xmath145 setting @xmath146 imposes a ( dimensionful ) holographic uv cut - off on the theory living on the @xmath111 boundary .",
    "since the minimal value of the coordinate @xmath147 is zero , it follows from ( [ eq : cmap ] ) that the range of @xmath116 is bounded by @xmath148 and hence the @xmath16 cut - off @xmath26 is related to the uniform uv cut - off @xmath149 .    at this point",
    "we do not have an analog of the map ( [ eq : cmap ] ) for the bubbling solution that is valid for all values of the coordinates .",
    "we can construct the map for the asymptotic region defined by the fg expansion for the @xmath15 boundary theory ( [ eq : fg ] ) , however this expansion breaks down once the fg coordinate @xmath97 is not small .",
    "as discussed in @xcite one can construct a map that is valid also near @xmath41 by patching together the expansion near the @xmath16 boundary and the fg boundary .",
    "we will not pursue this construction here since we focus all our calculations on the theory living on the @xmath15 boundary .",
    "however , since the metric is asymptotically @xmath2 , we expect that one should obtain only a small modification to the identification of the uv cut - offs that , crucially , does not affect the logarithmically divergent term in the entanglement entropy .    physically , the interpretation of @xmath26 as a uv cut - off and the form of the subtracted entanglement entropy is quite natural .",
    "note that the dominant contributions to the entanglement entropy come from uv degrees of freedom located near the entangling surface .",
    "since the wilson surface ( at fixed time ) intersects the entangling surface at two points in our geometry ( see figure [ fig : entanglesurf ] ) , the defect contribution to the entanglement entropy has essentially the same dimensionality as the entanglement entropy of a two - dimensional cft .",
    "this is also reflected in the @xmath16 slicing we employ and the fact that the minimal surface we find in the bulk is familiar from @xmath16/cft@xmath150 .",
    "hence an argument along the lines of those given in @xcite shows that the extra divergent contribution of the wilson surface should be logarithmic , wherein the cut - off is associated with a minimal distance to the defect .",
    "[ sec4 ] the goal of the present section is to calculate the one point function of the six - dimensional stress tensor holographically for an asymptotically @xmath0 bubbling solution .",
    "since the bubbling solutions are eleven - dimensional one has to utilize the machinery of kk holography that was developed in @xcite . note that a similar calculation was performed in @xcite for the type iib bubbling solution dual to half - bps wilson loop defects and we will largely adopt their method to our case .    the kk reduction of eleven - dimensional supergravity on @xmath101 produces a seven - dimensional supergravity ( with negative cosmological constant ) with infinite towers of massive fields @xcite .",
    "these can be classified by their seven - dimensional spin and representation of the relevant @xmath151 spherical harmonics ( scalar and tensorial ) on @xmath101 .",
    "one difficulty is the mixing of modes coming from the eleven - dimensional supergravity as well as the fact that seven - dimensional fields can be related by eleven - dimensional diffeomorphisms , leading to nonlinear gauge symmetries .",
    "the resulting seven - dimensional action can be diagonalized and the masses of all the fields were determined in @xcite .    via the ads / cft correspondence the seven - dimensional supergravity fields are dual to operators in the six - dimensional @xmath1-theory .",
    "the precise dictionary can be found for example in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was argued that in order to obtain a local seven - dimensional supergravity action without higher derivatives one needs in general to perform a kk reduction map that is nonlinear and relates the eleven- and seven - dimensionall fields schematically as @xmath152 here , @xmath153 is a differential operator and the ellipsis denotes higher order terms with three or more eleven - dimensional fields .",
    "this nonlinear mixing in general complicates holographic calculations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , a simple rule was derived in @xcite to determine when and which nonlinear terms appear . for a supergravity field dual to a dimension @xmath154 operator in the cft , the only nonlinear terms that can appear are the ones for which the sum of the dimensions of their respective dual operators is less than or equal to @xmath154 .",
    "when this rule is applied to the stress tensor , which has @xmath155 , it is clear that there can be no nonlinear mixing since the operators with lowest dimension have @xmath156 . , but such fields are free and decouple from the dynamics . ]",
    "the starting point for the calculation of the holographic stress tensor is to decompose the eleven - dimensional metric into a @xmath0 part and a perturbation , denoted as @xmath157 and @xmath42 respectively : @xmath158 we use the fg coordinate chart ( [ eq : fg ] ) where we can identify @xmath159 as the polar angle on @xmath101 .",
    "the wilson surface preserves an @xmath160 subgroup of the r - symmetry and so does the bubbling geometry .",

    "the calculation of the one point function of the stress tensor from the seven - dimensional metric ( [ sevenmet ] ) utilizes the standard method of holographic renormalization . in our case @xmath170 vanishes , and consequently the reduced metric is already in the fg form @xmath171 where the large @xmath81 limit corresponds to @xmath172 and the metric @xmath173 can be expressed as a power series in @xmath97 .",
