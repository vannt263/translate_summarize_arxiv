    "the successful creation of @xmath3k@xmath4rb polar molecules with high space density @xcite has sparked a lot of research interests because of its potential applications in various areas @xcite .",
    "an ultracold gas of polar molecules can provide a platform to study strongly - correlated systems @xcite , due to the confinement flexibility and the control over effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction can be turned into different effective interactions in the presence of a dc or ac electric field . when the dipole direction is fixed by a dc electric field ,",
    "a p - wave superfluid state with the dominant @xmath5 symmetry may appear in a 3d dipolar fermi gas @xcite .",
    "when an ac electric field is applied to couple different rotational levels of molecules , a @xmath6 superfluid state @xcite and a ferro - electric state @xcite may show up in quasi-2d dipolar fermi gases . creating the antiferromagnetic state and exotic superfluid states such as p - wave and d - wave states",
    "has been a focused goal in the research with optical lattices . in this work",
    "we predict that some of these phases can be created in polar molecules trapped in a 2d square optical lattice in the presence of a resonant ac electric field .    for the @xmath3k@xmath4rb molecule ,",
    "rotational excitation energies are much smaller than electronic and vibrational excitation energies . in the presence of the resonant ac electric field for the first two rotational states ,",
    "electronic and vibrational excitations can be ignored , and the rotational state of the dipole along or against the electric - field direction can represented by pseudospin - up or pseudospin - down state .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is thus effectively a dipolar ising interaction between pseudospins",
    ". the strength of this ising interaction can be much larger than the super - exchange interaction in a unpolarized two - component fermi gas trapped in the same optical lattice . in this aspect it is easier to create antiferromagnetic and superfluid states with exotic symmetries in the dipolar fermi gas .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "first we derive the effective hamiltonian for this system .",
    "then the antiferromagnetic state and superfluid states with different symmetries are studied in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the ground state is determined by comparing energies of these states .",
    "we find that the antiferromagnetic state is the ground state at half filling .",
    "when the filling factor is reduced to certain values , the superfluid state takes over . depending on the parameters , different superfluid states , such as d - wave ( @xmath0 ) ,",
    "extend s - wave ( @xmath1 ) , and the mixed - symmetry ( @xmath2 ) states , can appear .",
    "phase separation occurs between superfluid and antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "based on these results , the phase diagram at zero temperature is obtained and its experimental implication is discussed .",
    "the hamiltonian of a single @xmath3k@xmath4rb molecule trapped in a two - dimensional optical lattice in the presence of an ac electric field is given by @xmath7 where the first r .- h .- s .",
    "term is the molecule kinetic energy for the center - of - mass motion , and the second r .-",
    "term is the potential energy in the optical lattice .",
    "the rotational energy of the molecule in the presence of the ac electric field is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath10 is the rotational constant , * d * is dipole operator , and @xmath11 is the ac electric field .",
    "the eigenstate of the angular momentum is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are quantum numbers of the total angular momentum and its z - component . in this work",
    "we consider a linearly polarized ac field in the @xmath15 direction with amplitude @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the frequency @xmath18 is set to couple rotational states @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath0 is the dipole moment . under the rotating wave approximation @xcite in the basis of @xmath19 and @xmath22 , the molecule rotational energy is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 . in the following we concentrate on the resonance limit @xmath25 with small electric field , where the two rotational states are nearly degenerate .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a dipole at @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the direction of @xmath30 . in the presence of an resonant ac electric field , only rotational states @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath20 are important .",
    "the matrix elements of the dipole operator in this subspace are given by @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "for this two - level system , we can define the pseudospin states @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so that the dipole matrix elements are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . in this new basis",
    ", the interaction between two dipoles can be conveniently written as a dipolar ising interaction between pseudospins , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath15 component of the pseudospin @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the angle between @xmath29 and the @xmath15 direction .",
    "for this system , the optical lattice is set in the plane perpendicular to the electric field , @xmath42 .",
    "for a dipolar fermi gas trapped in a two - dimensional optical lattice in the presence of a resonant ac electric field , the effective hamiltonian is therefore given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fermion annihilation operator for site @xmath45 and spin @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the spin coupling constant between fermions at positions @xmath28 and @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 .",

    "( [ hamiltonian 1 ] ) includes both the s - wave scattering between different spin components and the onsite dipole interaction , and it can be tuned either by using feshbach resonance or by changing the vertical confinement @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on the effect of the dipolar ising interaction and set @xmath52 in the rest of this paper .",
    "since the dipolar ising interaction is a short - range interaction in two dimension and the spin coupling constant is the largest between nearest - neighbor spins , the system tends to lower its energy by placing fermions with opposite spins at nearest - neighbor sites , which can lead to two different types of ground states .",
    "the first one is the antiferromagnetic state in which spins align oppositely at nearest neighbors .",
    "the other type is the superfluid state with exotic symmetries where a fermion attracts another fermion with the opposite spin at nearest neighbors to form a cooper pair . under the current experimental condition @xcite ,",
    "the strength of the dipolar ising interaction between nearest neighbors is approximately @xmath53 for the singlet rovibrational state , the hopping amplitude @xmath50 is close to @xmath54 @xmath55 @xcite for a typical optical lattice with the strength @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the lattice constant is @xmath59 .",
    "in contrast , the super - exchange interaction of an ordinary fermi gas is usually much smaller than the hopping amplitude @xmath50 , which makes it more difficult to produce ordered states .",
    "the dipolar fermi gas has another advantage that the spin fluctuation in ising systems is much less than that in heisenberg systems , which is helpful to stabilize ordered states .",
    "for these reasons , the superfluid and antiferromagnetic states may be easier to be created in the dipolar fermi gas than in an ordinary fermi gas . in the following we focus on the properties of",
    "these ordered states at zero temperature .",
    "to study the antiferromagnetic state , we divide the square lattice into two sublattices a and b so that nearest neighbors of one sublattice all belong to the other sublattice .",
