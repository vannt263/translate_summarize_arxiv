    "we are interested in o  vi absorption in qso spectra because it is the easiest way to find cosmologically distributed hot gas with @xmath12  k. such gas may have been missed from existing surveys of qso absorption systems which require damped lines , lyman continuum absorption , and mg  ii or c  iv lines . unlike other qso absorption systems ,",
    "this hot gas might be collisionally ionized and could comprise the bulk of all baryons .",
    "we are extremely interested in whether the o  vi gas is photoionized or collisionally ionized .",
    "we consider collisional ionization because gas of the required temperatures exists , and there may be insufficient high energy photons for photoionization , especially at low redshifts ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we are also interested in the source of the ionizing energy  mechanical heating of the gas , or high energy uv photons .",
    "gas at temperatures needed to collisionally ionize o  vi has been seen in galaxies , so we expect to see it in qso absorption spectra .",
    "pettini & dodorico ( 1986 ) have detected fe  x absorption from million degree gas in the galactic halo and the large magellanic cloud , while davidsen et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have seen o  vi in absorption from gas in the our galaxy s halo along the direction to 3c273 .",
    "high latitude clouds in our galaxy produce shadows in the soft x - ray background ( @xcite ) which reveal gas at @xmath14  k in the halo of our galaxy , and similar halos have been detected in other late - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "but the x - ray halos of early - type galaxies are too hot ",
    "@xmath15  k  to show strong metal lines in the hst wavelength range ( @xcite ) .",
    "photoionization is known to the dominate in most qso absorption systems which show strong c  iv or mg  ii ( @xcite ) , but o  vi is different .",
    "photons with energies above 114  ev are needed to create o  vi , and these are scarce because they are absorbed by both hydrogen and helium .",
    "qsos and agn are the likely sources of such photons .",
    "qsos and agn apparently do emit at these energies because they show strong o  vi emission , and ne  viii ( @xmath9207  ev ) emission lines are also common ( @xcite ) .",
    "but we do not know if this radiation escapes from the qso environment , or from the host galaxies , which might be opaque in the he  ii continuum .",
    "the he  ii gunn - peterson absorption provides a measure of the spectrum of the intergalactic background radiation field .",
    "the igm he  ii / h  i ratio depends on the flux of photons capable of ionizing he  ii to he  iii , and h  i to h  ii .",
    "jakobsen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) find that the optical depth at he  ii 304    is @xmath16 , which indicates that the spectrum of the radiation which ionizes the igm is very steep .",
    "madua ( 1994 ) detects little flux above 4 rydberg , therefore even fewer photons exist above 114  ev .",
    "we conclude that the hot gas may be similar to that in the halo of our galaxy and collisionally ionized ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it might be heated by gas cloud collisions and supernovae explosions which eject disk gas into the outer regions of the halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gas heated to a million degrees cools through radiative and dielectronic recombination on time scales of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the electron density ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same o  vi 2s2p transition studied in this paper is responsible for the large cooling peak at @xmath19 ( @xcite ) . to sustain collisionally ionized o  vi absorption systems",
    ", the densities must be very low ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) , or the heating sources must be very strong",
    ".      hot gas with strong o  vi lines could be the largest portion of all baryons , exceeding the @xmath227% in local stars and stellar remnants , and the @xmath22 7 % seen in cool gas as damped ly@xmath23 systems at @xmath24(@xcite ) .",
    "the missing baryons might be condensed ( e.g. brown dwarfs , black holes ) , or diffuse hot ionized gas in clouds which are the subject of this paper . gas which is hotter than @xmath25  k may be seen for the first time since o  vi lines are then stronger than those of c  iv ( verner , tytler & barthel 1994 , hereafter vtb94 ) .",
    "the missing baryons could also be in the igm , and too hot to show ultraviolet lines .",
    "cobe limits on the compton distortion @xmath26 parameter limit the temperature and density of a hot and dense igm , but even if all baryons were in the igm , the maximum temperature is still a few kev ( few @xmath27  k ; @xcite;@xcite ) , which is still too hot to show uv absorption lines",
    ".    many of the missing baryons could be in gas which is cooler .",
    "o  vi is most prevalent at @xmath28  k ( vtb94 ) . by @xmath29",
    "k o  vi lines will be stronger than those from c  iv or n  v , and for highest temperatures c  iv and n  v will not be visible at all ( vtb94 ) .",
    "we will only see the part of the hot gas which is enriched with metals , this could include most hot gas if the heating is associated with supernovae , galaxy formation and mergers , and if all galaxies enrich the gas in their surroundings as occur in clusters .",
    "although there have been no traditional surveys for individual o  vi lines in qso spectra because of severe blending of lines in the forest , the following absorption line studies have observed o  vi and provide strong evidence that o  vi absorption is both real and common .",
    "hartquist & snijders ( 1982 ) showed that o  vi is common in absorption systems which are very close to qsos , the `` associated '' c  iv systems .",
    "tytler & barthel ( unpublished ) found that most associated systems with strong c  iv lines ( @xmath30   ) have o  vi , and o  vi is also common in bal systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "in all these cases the o  vi is strong because the absorbers are near individual qsos .",
    "therefore the gas is probably photoionized , which shows that many qsos do emit above 114  ev .",
    "this radiation does escape into the qso s galaxy , but not necessarily into the igm .",
    "lu & savage ( 1993 ) formed a single composite spectrum of the absorption lines from typical high redshift ( @xmath31 @xmath32 ) absorption systems which show relatively strong c  iv lines .",
    "they found o  vi in systems which had c  iv , but they could not determine the fraction of c  iv systems with o  vi .",
    "some had low ionization lines , while others did not .",
    "they did not detect n  v lines , and deduced @xmath33(o  vi)/@xmath33(n  v ) @xmath34 , which implies @xmath35  k for collisional ionization .",
    "bahcall et al . ( 1993 ) note that o  vi is seen in three of the metal line systems in their hst quasar spectra , one of which was an associated absorber .",
    "bergeron et al .",
    "( 1994 ) note that 4 of 5 metal systems show o  vi , but they are unable to determine if the gas is collisionally ionized or photoionized .",
    "these results all suggest that o  vi systems are as common or more common than c  iv systems ( several per qso )",
    ". we will now determine how common .    first we show that we can identify o  vi doublets in the forest .",
    "we choose to work with hst uv spectra because the forest is less dense at the lower redshifts of hst spectra compared to the higher redshifts visible from the ground .",
    "we measure the frequency of o  vi systems , and we try to determine the level of ionization , and whether the gas is photoionized or collisionally ionized .",
    "finally we estimate the contribution that hot gas makes to the cosmological mass density of baryons .",
    "the hubble space telescope archive provides a resource to search for o  vi absorption . in particular , the medium resolution ( r @xmath36 1300 ) gratings of the faint object spectrograph have both the sensitivity and the resolving power to identify weak metal lines in absorption .",
    "spectra are chosen by the qso properties ( magnitude and redshift ) , gratings , and exposure time . since the search for o  vi is done exclusively in the lyman-@xmath23 forest , high signal - to - noise",
    "is necessary .    to ensure the reality of o  vi absorption , strict rules are applied to line lists .",
    "these rules incorporate measured wavelength , equivalent width , and 1@xmath37 errors .",
    "once the ground rules are determined , a computer algorithm is responsible for identifying systems which exhibit o  vi absorption .",
    "we use a computer to automatically find o  vi and to maintain objectivity and repeatability .",
    "physical significance is measured by applying the same rules to false sets of rest wavelengths and comparing results with the true set .",
    "we consider spectra from only the fos high resolution gratings g130h , g190h and g270h .",
    "the g160l does not have enough resolution , and there were no suitable ghrs g140l spectra .",
    "table 1 shows the 11 qsos chosen for the o  vi search .",
    "most of the spectra are from the g190h or g270h gratings , because few g130h spectra have adequate s / n .",
    "there are 8 steps prior to the o  vi search ,    1 .",
    "we use the following rules to ensure that the @xmath38 of each qso is sufficient to place o  vi well onto the fos gratings : @xmath39 2 .",
    "we obtained each spectrum and its error array from the hst archive .",
    "coadd spectra which have multiple exposures .",
    "find all the absorption lines from the interstellar medium of our galaxy .",
    "we shift each spectrum so that these lines give a mean velocity of zero ( @xcite ) .",
    "we list the offsets added to each spectrum in table 1 .",
    "5 .   fit a continuum to each spectrum manually .",
    "due to the subjectivity of continuum fitting , the systematic errors introduced in the measured equivalent widths are difficult to calculate",
    ". however , we assume that other errors in our final results greatly outweigh the errors in the continuum fits . 6 .",
    "convert the spectrum and its error array into a spectrum which gives the minimum equivalent width of unresolved lines of specified significance level .",
    "7 .   find all @xmath40 lines in a spectrum .",
    "there are typically 40  80 .",
    "measure their equivalent widths @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and wavelengths . 8 .",
    "search the literature for all known absorption systems .",
    "identify lines which belong to these systems , and remove them from the sample in which we will search for o  vi .",
    "there are no published systematic searches for individual spectral lines in the ly@xmath23 forest region because the large number of forest lines and the high incidence of line blending lead to numerous false identification .",
    "we require a search which has the desirable attributes of a medical screen for a rare disease : ( 1 ) high sensitivity to minimize the number of missed o  vi systems ( false negatives ) , and ( 2 ) high specificity to minimize the number of false positive identifications .",
    "we use a computer code to increase the sensitivity , accuracy , completeness and speed of the survey , and use rules to limit the number of false positives to about 20% of the sample .",
    "we would prefer to have fewer false positives , but this is only possible if we consider just the very strongest lines .",
    "then we miss most o  vi lines , and we can not estimate their overall frequency .",
    "false identifications can be noise features , or real lines with other identifications , especially ly@xmath23 .",
    "we use three criteria to limit the number of false identification : line significance , redshift agreement , and equivalent width ratios . in all detections , both o  vi lines must be detected above the @xmath43 equivalent width limit . furthermore , their measured equivalent width ratio must lie within @xmath44 of the theoretical boundaries .    the procedures we use to find o  vi lines in certain and possible redshift systems are described below .      in published , or new metal line systems ( e.g. with mg  ii , c  iv or lyman limits ) which are considered certain , we look for @xmath43 o  vi lines .",
    "there are about 0  3 such systems per qso , so the chance of false positive identification of both o  vi lines is @xmath45 per qso .",
    "we measure lines associated with the absorption systems and calculate the mean redshift , which can vary from the published absorption redshift because of wavelength offsets .",
    "we identify all additional lines , including o  vi , which match the criteria of the next section .",
    "we use the following procedure to find interesting lines , identify possible new redshift systems and then reject unreasonable ones .    1 .",
    "we search for all systems with at least two @xmath46 lines from ly@xmath23 , ly@xmath47 , ly@xmath48 or o  vi .",
    "lines are accepted into a system if their redshift differs from the weighted mean @xmath49 by less than 0.0005 ( @xmath50 ) , which is sufficient to include 93% of lines in metal systems identified by bahcall et al .",
    "the weighted mean @xmath49 is defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the weight placed on the redshift of each line : @xmath53 where fwhm is the spectral resolution of each grating in  .",
    "we define the equivalent width cut - off as the limit for unsaturated lines .",
    "once a line becomes saturated , the accuracy of the line center depends only on the s / n of the spectrum .",
    "lines which exceed the saturation criterion are marked in table 4 .",
    "we calculate expected positions of the remaining lines in these system , and we measure wavelengths and equivalent widths , or limits for these lines . 3 .",
    "we search for additional identifications for the new @xmath54 lines amongst all systems with at least two @xmath46 lines .",
    "4 .   as a further constraint",
    ", we use the ratios @xmath55 and @xmath56 if ly@xmath47 ( 1025 ) or o  vi(1038 ) is not present , then the ratios are calculated using the @xmath57 equivalent width limits .",
    "a ratio is judged acceptable if it falls between @xmath58 and @xmath59 for o  vi , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 for h  i , where @xmath62 is the error on the ratio obtained from the errors on the individual @xmath41 values , and the numerical values are for unsaturated and saturated lines .",
    "we discard systems which do not have at least one acceptable ratio .",
    "we wrote a computer code to follow the above procedures , and we ran this code with both true and false rest wavelengths .",
    "the false wavelengths did not have the same ratios as the true wavelengths of any strong lines .",
    "we then counted the number of o  vi systems identified with both true and false wavelengths .",
    "the above procedures were then adjusted to give a true / false ratio of 5:1 .",
    "we also ran tests with true rest wavelengths and random absorption line positions , which gave the same result .",
    "unfortunately , we did not accept lone o  vi lines , because the number of false identifications was similar to the true number . in figure 1",
    ", we show the number our simulations show that we must insist that all systems have @xmath63 lines to keep the expected number of false o  vi identifications @xmath64 1 per spectrum .",
    "simulations indicate that should be stronger than o  vi in either collisional or photo- ionization ( vtb94 ) , so we use lines of the lyman series to confirm o  vi identifications .",
    "although we exclude possible o  vi detections , it is necessary to detect a third line to keep false identifications to a minimum .",
    "a lyman line must be detected at the o  vi redshift with the following stipulations :    1 .   if exists and @xmath65 is acceptable , then the system is accepted .",
    "2 .   if exists without a , the system is discarded .",
    "3 .   if exists and has an acceptable equivalent width ratio with , and can not be checked , the system is accepted .",
    "no method will throw out all false systems and keep all real ones .",
    "for example , consider pairs of @xmath66 lines which are identified as ly@xmath23 and ly@xmath47 .",
    "simulations show that such pairs do occur commonly , even in hst spectra at low @xmath67 : we expect 2 false pairs of @xmath66 lines in every qso .",
    "but in real data we see about 6 such ly@xmath23  ly@xmath47 pairs per qso , so 67% are real .",
    "we look for @xmath68 o  vi lines in each such system .",
    "in table 2 , we list the number of o  vi systems identified with three different sample criteria . in sample",
    "a , the absorption system identified with o  vi must have at least three lines with a redshift within @xmath69 of the weighted mean redshift of the system .",
    "all lines must have a significance level @xmath70 .",
    "sample b is a subset of a where at least two of the lines must have a significance level of @xmath71 .",
    "sample c is a subset of a , with the constraint that both lines of the o  vi doublet must have a rest equivalent width @xmath72 0.21  , which is the minimum 2@xmath37 rest equivalent width which could be seen in all the spectra .",
    "sample c is the most stringent and complete sub - sample and will be used to measure the density of o  vi systems .",
    "also shown in the same table is the number of o  vi identifications per object using false rest wavelengths .",
    "simulations were run with 10 sets of false wavelengths for , , and o  vi .",
    "we used the same criteria as with the real wavelengths .",
    "the average number of false identifications is shown in the table , and gives an estimate of the number of identifications in the true sample which are due to chance .",
    "samples a and b differ by less than we expected , because there is only one system in a that does not satisfy the requirements of b. but a contains twice as many false ids as b , so b is a significantly cleaner sample .",
    "the line density is actually higher in b than a , but the difference is not significant .    with 11 objects in this preliminary survey",
    ", we can estimate the number of o  vi absorbers per unit redshift .",

    "table 3 contains system number densities for a variety of absorption systems .",
    "the first three are our samples of o  vi , and the fourth is a sample of pairs in which we found w(1025 ) @xmath76 0.30for comparison with other samples , we use sample c , which is most complete . at low @xmath67 systems with o",
    "vi are as common as the other main types of system : mg  ii , c  iv and lls .",
    "table 4 shows the twelve systems of sample a. for each of these systems we searched for all other strong lines which would appear in the observed wavelength range , including : c  iv 1548 , 1550 , n  v 1238 , 1242 , si  iii  1206 , si  ii  1190 , 1193 , 1260 , si  iv  1393 , 1402 , n  iii  989 , c  iii  977 , and c  ii  1334 .",

    "lines are accepted into a system if their redshift is within @xmath780.0005 of the weighted mean .    in figure 2",
    "we show the absorption line positions on the hst spectra .",
    "note that the , o  vi(1032 ) and o  vi(1038 ) lines form a well resolved uniformly spaced triplet , which helps visual identifications .",
    "for each of the 12 o  vi systems of sample a , figure 3 shows enlarged plots of , , o  vi and c  iv all on a velocity scale given by the listed mean redshift .",
    "we do not show lines which are below @xmath54 significance .",
    "line widths are all set by the fos resolution .",
    "comments on individual systems are in the appendix .",
    "lu & savage ( 1993 ) point out that o  vi 1037.62 can be contaminated by c  ii 1036.34 and o  i 1039.23 , especially in low ionization systems .",
    "lines o  vi(1038 ) and c  ii(1036 ) are separated by @xmath79 so to resolve these lines we need spectra with resolution @xmath80 785 .",
    "the fos high resolution spectra have r @xmath36 1300 so we would expect , assuming usual @xmath81 parameters @xmath82 75 km  s@xmath83 , that these lines should be resolved in this survey .",
    "we do just resolve these lines , and we fitted each to get their individual equivalent widths which are listed in table 5 .    as a check we measured lines c  ii 1334.53 and o  i 1302.17 which should both be stronger than the contaminants c  ii 1036.34 and o  i 1039.23 because their @xmath84 values are larger by 1.3 and 6.6 times respectively .",
    "we follow this procedure :    1 .",
    "measure width of c  ii(1334 ) .",
    "2 .   calculate line width of c  ii(1036 ) with ratio of oscillator strengths , assuming lines are linear .",
    "measure total width from 10361038  .",
    "4 .   subtract calculated c  ii(1036 ) from the combined width of step 3    in table 5 , we list the equivalent widths of o  vi(1032 ) , o  vi ( 1036 - 1038 ) and c  ii(1334 ) .",
    "the o  vi 1036 - 1038 widths in table 5 includes both o  vi and c  ii , whereas those in table 4 are for o  vi alone .",
    "we detect c  ii(1334 ) in four o  vi systems , and for each of these systems , we subtract w(c  ii,1036 ) from @xmath85(1036 - 1038 ) to calculate the `` subtracted '' doublet ratio .",
    "if absorption is due to o  vi and c  ii alone , this would provide the correct width of o  vi(1038 ) .",
    "for all the systems of sample a , both the fitted and subtracted doublet ratios fall within the allowed 1@xmath37 errors .",
    "the fitting procedure contains less steps and is subject to less uncertainty than the subtracting precedure .",
    "since the spectra of this survey have adequate resolution to separate c  ii(1036 ) and o  vi(1038 ) , we conclude that the measured widths and ratios obtained by fitting o  vi and c  ii ( table 4 ) independently are more accurate .    the other possible contamination due to o  i is ruled out .",
    "o  i @xmath86 was not detected in any systems associated with o  vi . so the contribution from the weaker o  i(1039 ) is safely assumed negligible .",
    "we employ the doublet ratio method to estimate column densities and velocity dispersions where possible .",
    "table 6 shows our calculations for o  vi , c  iv , and h  i in systems where two or more ions are present .",
    "we calculate the 1@xmath37 errors in table 6 by allowing the equivalent widths to assume any value with their 1@xmath37 errors and taking the extreme results as limits .",
    "this is an over estimation of the random errors which partially compensates for the systematic errors of measuring equivalent widths of unresolved lines in the forest .",
    "wavelengths and f - values used in the column density calculations were taken from morton ( 1991 ) .    as seen from table 6 , our search was only sensitive to column densities log(n ) @xmath9 14.4 .",

    "figure 4 shows the allowable column densities of a single component for a given doublet ratio .",
    "our survey of o  vi is not sensitive to _ linear _ single component absorbers .",
    "high velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 100 ) is strong evidence for multiple absorbers in the system .",
    "hst fos spectra do not have enough spectral resolution to give accurate column densities and velocity dispersions , so it is difficult to determine if the gas is photoionized or collisionally ionized .",
    "so we use the relative strengths of the o  vi , c  iv , and lines to indicate the level of ionization .",

    "five of the seven medium ionization systems exhibit multiple low ionization lines ( i.e. c  ii , c  iii , n  iii , si  ii , si  iii ) . the ionization energies in each of the five systems range from  11ev to 114ev .",
    "such a wide range of ionizations , and therefore a large variety of ions , can not be modeled with pure collisional ionization in a single simple cloud . as was restated by verner and yakolev ( 1990 ) ,",
    "the large variety of ions found in absorption systems is strong evidence that power law ionizing radiation is present .",

    "this system has significantly different values and is classified as high ionization .",
    "only collisional ionization at high temperatures , @xmath95 , or extreme photoionization , @xmath96 , can produce the measured ratios ( @xmath97 is the ratio of the number of photons with energies above the lyman edge to the number of particles ) .",
    "since c  iv is so weak and n  v is undetected , we believe that the system is collisionally ionized .    in the remaining four systems in which o  vi was detected , none had a corresponding c  iv detection .",

    "let @xmath117(z ) be defined as the ratio of mean metallicity at redshift @xmath67 to the solar metallicity ,    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is the mean molecular weight , which equals 1.3 for a mixture of 25% helium and 75% hydrogen by mass ; @xmath120 ( @xcite ) ; and @xmath121 is the cosmological baryon mass density . the ionization fraction o / o  vi is impossible to calculate for each absorption system with the current data , but a lower limit is placed on the metallicity by assuming o / o  vi = 1 .",
    "a recent measurement of deuterium at high redshift by ( tytler & fan 1994 ) yields @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath123    the calculation is subject to small number statistics , and we can estimate the sensitivity of the lower limit by removing one system of sample c. if we discard the system with the largest equivalent width ( = 0.927 towards 1206 + 4557 ) , the lower limit is reduced by 35% .",
    "the calculated lower limit is a safe estimate for the following reasons : we have assumed that all oxygen at @xmath6 is in the form of o  vi , that all absorption is linear , and that we have detected all o  vi along the absorption path .",
    "o  vi absorption is as common at @xmath6 as c  iv and mg  ii absorption . using a minimum rest equivalent width of @xmath87    and accounting for the average number of chance coincidences per spectra ,",
    "the number density of o  vi absorbers per redshift is      using a systematic computer search , we found 12 redshifts with @xmath70 equivalent widths at o  vi wavelengths .",
    "the o  vi systems were categorized as either medium or high ionization , seven systems are medium ionization , with 5 showing multiple low ionization lines .",
    "the 5 high ionization systems have o  vi stronger than both c  iv and .",
    "we summed over all o  vi absorption with widths above the threshold @xmath125   to estimate the cosmological mass density at @xmath126 . since we could not resolve velocity structure , we calculated a lower limit by assuming linear absorption ,          the survey for hot gas , such as o  vi , must be pursued in the future .",
    "in addition to better statistics at low redshift , the survey should be extended to high redshift to measure changes in the abundance of hot gas .",
    "ions with higher energies , such as ne  viii and mg  x , should be studied .",
    "the launch of the hubble space telescope has allowed us to quantify the amount of 100 ev intergalactic gas for the first time .",
