    "the common features of the hot gdr are : ( 1 ) its energy is nearly independent of @xmath0 and @xmath4 , ( 2 ) its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) remains mostly unchanged in the region of @xmath5 1 mev , but increases sharply with @xmath0 within 1@xmath6 2.5 - 3 mev , and seems to saturate at @xmath7 4 mev . as a function of @xmath4 , a significant increase in the gdr width",

    "@xcite some gdr data were reanalyzed by adding the pre - equlibrium @xmath10 emission and it was claimed that the gdr width does not saturate .",
    "however , it was realized later that the pre - equilibrium emission is proportional to the asymmetry between projectiles and targets and lowers the cn excitation energy , which alters the conclusion on the role of pre - equlibrium emission .",

    "this indicates that the effect of evaporation width , if any , may become noticeable only at much higher values of @xmath0 ( @xmath16 3.3 mev ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath16 30@xmath9 ) . in a classical representation of the gdr as a damped spring mass system",

    "the width of the gdr built of the ground state ( @xmath17 0 ) ( the quantal width @xmath18 ) , consists of the three components : ( i ) the landau width @xmath19 , which is essentially the variance @xmath20 of the @xmath21-state distribution , ( ii ) the spreading width @xmath22 caused by coupling of @xmath23 states to more complicated configurations such as @xmath24 ones , and ( iii ) the escape width @xmath25 owing to the direct particle decay into hole states of the residual nucleus because of coupling to continuum . in medium and heavy nuclei , the major contribution to @xmath26 is given by @xmath22 , whereas @xmath19 and @xmath25 account for a small fraction .",
