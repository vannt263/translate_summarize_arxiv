    "let us now present our study and its results in more detail .",
    "we consider for simplicity a two dimensional ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) system consisting of two species of particles , say , a representing the ions in the chamber ( of dimension @xmath3 , ) and b , representing the carriers in the narrow channel ( of dimension @xmath4 , @xmath52 ) , with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean number density of ions .",
    "we work with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath1 direction , and hard walls at @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the flow field imposed on a particles is plane couette , with velocity in the @xmath1 direction and gradient in the @xmath2 direction till a certain separation between the walls ( @xmath11 ) , beyond which the velocity is uniform ( fig .",
    "[ modelfigure ] ) .",
    "this flow geometry effectively models the flow field near a small obstacle in bulk flow , such that gradients are concentrated in the boundary layer on the surface of the obstacle .",
    "there is no flow field imposed on b particles .",
    "both a and b particles are overdamped and the pairwise interactions are screened coulomb in nature .",
    "further b particles are 100 times more diffusive than their a counterparts .",
    "the positions @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , evolve according to overdamped langevin equations , with independent gaussian , zero - mean , thermal white noise sources @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) , interparticle forces @xmath16 from the pair potentials , and for the ions an additional force due to the flow field @xmath17 .",
    "let us nondimensionalise our variables as follows : scale all lengths by @xmath18 , energy by boltzmann s constant @xmath19 times temperature @xmath20 ( and hence force by @xmath21 ) , and time by the time @xmath22 taken by a carrier to traverse a distance @xmath18 .",
    "then our nondimensional discretised langevin equations are for a given type ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) of particles , @xmath25 \\delta t + \\sqrt{2 d_a \\delta t } \\,\\ , { \\bf h_a}(t),\\ ] ] @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the nondimensionalised brownian diffusivities for the ions and carriers respectively and obey the fluctuation dissipation relation , i.e. , for example for @xmath23 particles , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the unit tensor and @xmath31 label particle indices .",
    "the pair potentials have the screened coulomb form @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is a coupling coefficient of the dlvo form . , where @xmath34 is the dielectric constant of the solvent , @xmath35 is the charge on and @xmath36 is the radius of the @xmath37 particle . in our simulations ,",
    "the dimensionless value of the @xmath38 independent part of @xmath33 is @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . ] ) at interparticle separation @xmath42 , with different @xmath38 s for @xmath43 and @xmath44 interaction , while there is no @xmath45 interaction .",
    "also both the @xmath23 and @xmath24 particles carry charges of identical sign and magnitude .",
    "the dimensions of the box containing @xmath23 particles is @xmath46 and @xmath47 , whereas for b particles @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . keeping @xmath50=10 and @xmath51=2 fixed",
    ", we monitor the behavior of the system by changing : ( 1 ) width of the channel containing the carriers @xmath0 , ( 2 ) ion - ion interaction strength , @xmath52 and ( 3 ) sign of the @xmath53 i.e. ion - carrier interaction .",
    "we also explore the effect of changing the screening length of the ion - carrier ( @xmath53 ) interaction , keeping other parameters constant .",
    "we have studied the behavior of this model for a system with @xmath54 particles and @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath7 and @xmath57 being the number densities for the ions and carriers respectively . the results presented here",
    "pertain to the latter case , the observed behavior being qualitatively same for both cases .    for @xmath58",
    ", we observe that the carriers do have a unidirectional drift in the direction of the flow .",
    "the average drift velocity of the carriers initially increases with the flow rate , reaches a maximum and then decreases at large values of the flow rate as seen in fig .",
    "[ diacapr3kappaa1d1a ] .",
    "this is broadly in agreement with the ideas of @xcite . on further decreasing @xmath0 to first @xmath59 and then @xmath60 ( fig.[diacapr3kappaa1d1a ] )",
    ", we find that the drift velocity induced is progressively larger than for @xmath61 , and the saturation occurs at a lower value of the flow rate .",
    "now keeping the wall to wall distance fixed at @xmath62 , we study the behavior of the system at very small ( @xmath52=0.2 ) ( fig .",
    "[ repulwbpt5kappaapt2])and large ( @xmath52=4 ) ion - ion interaction screening strength ( fig .",
    "[ repulwbpt5kappaa4 ] ) .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath63 corresponds to stronger ion - ion interactions and it is observed that in such a case the induced effect on the carriers is stronger and is sustained till a larger value of the ionic flow speed at which the weakening sets in .",
    "we now look at the scenario where the two species a ( ions ) and b ( carriers ) have opposite charges ( fig .",
    "[ attractab ] ) . the wall to wall distance",
    "is kept fixed at @xmath64 .",
    "we observe that the induced drift is stronger than when both a and b particles carry like charges , at the same @xmath0 .",
    "the fluctuations in the drift velocity are however much larger than for the case of like charges ( fig .",
    "[ attractiverepulsivefluc ] ) : the ratio of standard deviation to mean is @xmath65 times that for the repulsive case .",
    "this can be explained as follows : the attraction of the carriers for the ions brings both close to the wall separating them , from time to time , enhancing the flow induced current .",
    "subsequently the presence of the walls pushes them apart , reducing the induced current again .",
    "this implies large fluctuations in the current . for like charged ions and carriers both the coulomb repulsion and the walls act in tandem to keep them apart ,",
    "thus the intermittent enhancement and reduction in current does not occur .    in order to understand the dependence of the effect on the strength of a - b interaction",
    ", we monitored the system for different values of the screening length corresonding to the a - b interaction ( fig .",
    "[ diffkappaabinverse ] ) keeping the channel width @xmath0 and a - a interaction strength constant .",
    "we find that the effect increases on increasing the screening length @xmath66 and is maximum where @xmath66 is comparable to the width of the channel @xmath0 ; therafter it saturates and does nt show a marked increase .",
    "this shows that the contribution to the flow induced effect indeed chiefly comes from the a particles ( or ions ) present in a boundary layer of order of the width of the channel at the interface of the chamber and the channel .",
    "we observe that our simulations ( fig .",
    "[ comparewithanalytics ] ) agree well with the theoretical predictions of a saturating dependence of the induced velocity of the carriers on the imposed flow speeds ( fig .",
    "[ shankarfig ] ) .",
    "we further find the current _ decreases _ when @xmath67 passes a threshold value @xmath68 , and that @xmath68 is _ smaller _ for smaller @xmath0 .",
    "this observation demands a theoretical explanation which at present we do not have .",
    "we hope this will motivate further experiments to check this prediction .",
    "it is significant that we are able to observe this type of `` brownian drag '' and transfer of momentum even in the absence of momentum conservation and in the extreme limit of no inertia .",
    "also , though strictly speaking fluctuation dissipation relations are valid only in equilibrium , a naive extension of fdt as in @xcite to the flowing case would imply a decrease in the rate of relaxation with increasing flow rate , and hence a `` loss of grip '' and a velocity weakening , which is what we find .",

    "<S> motivated by recent experiments @xcite reporting that carbon nanotubes immersed in a flowing fluid displayed an electric current and voltage , we numerically study the behaviour of a collection of brownian particles in a channel , in the presence of a flow field applied on similar but slower particles in a wide chamber in contact with the channel . for a suitable range of shear rates , we find that the flow field induces a unidirectional drift in the confined particles , and is stronger for narrower channels . </S>",
    "<S> the average drift velocity initially rises with increasing shear rate , then shows saturation for a while , thereafter starts decreasing , in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical studies @xcite based on brownian drag and `` loss of grip '' . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , if the sign of the interspecies interaction is reversed , the direction of the induced drift remains the same , but the flow - rate at which loss of grip occurs is lower , and the level of fluctuations is higher .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments show that liquid flow past single walled carbon nanotube ( swnt ) bundles generates voltage @xcite and electric current @xcite in the nanotube , along the direction of flow . </S>",
    "<S> the current and voltage are found @xcite to be highly sublinear functions of the fluid flow rate . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of flow - induced current relative to fluid flow is determined @xcite by the nature of the ions in the vicinity of the nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments in @xcite also showed that the one - dimensional nature of the swnts was essential for the generation of a net electrical signal in the sample : experiments on graphite did not generate a measurable signal and those on multiwalled carbon nanotubes produced a signal approximately 10 times weaker than that for the single walled nanotubes , the dimensions of the sensing element and flow speeds of the ionic liquid remaining same . </S>",
    "<S> electrokinetic @xcite and phonon - wind @xcite based explanations give a linear current versus flow rate dependence . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a recent proposal @xcite involving stick - slip and barrier hopping of ions giving a sublinear dependence . </S>",
    "<S> ghosh _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite explain the phenomenon as follows : thermal fluctuations in the ionic charge density in the fluid near the nanotube produce a stochastic coulomb field on the carriers in the nanotube . at thermal equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , if there is no mean fluid flow , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem tells us that the power spectral density of these fluctuations contributes to the frictional drag on the carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the total friction or resistivity of the carriers is thus the sum of contributions from the ambient ions and from phonons or other mechanisms intrinsic to the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> an imposed fluid flow advects the ions . </S>",
    "<S> the carriers in the nanotube then have to move at a speed determined by balancing the drag forces due to the ions and the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> however , increasing the fluid velocity also doppler - shifts the autocorrelation function of the ionic charge density , hence speeding up its time - decay as seen by the carriers and reducing the drag due to the ions . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a saturation of the flow - induced voltage and current . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xcite was done in a simplified framework , where the ions were assumed to move with a single mean velocity . in the experiment </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of fluid ( and ions ) increases with distance from the nanotube surface . </S>",
    "<S> ions nearest the nanotube contribute the strongest coulomb field but move the slowest . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting , first , to see if the form of the dependence of current on flow - speed remains intact when these competing tendencies are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , it remains to be seen if the theory of @xcite produces a weaker effect when extended to flow past a higher dimensional conductor . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , only the two - point correlations of the ionic coulomb field enter the ( gaussian ) treatment of @xcite , which means that changing the sign of the ionic charge can have no effect . testing the importance of non - gaussian fluctuations is important , but hard to do analytically . </S>",
    "<S> all three questions are easily resolved in a numerical simulation .    motivated by these considerations </S>",
    "<S> , we carry out a brownian dynamics study on a model system ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ modelfigure ] ) consisting of two types of particles , ( i ) particles ` a ' of low diffusivity in a chamber ( ions ) and ( ii ) particles ` b ' of comparatively high diffusivity ( carriers ) confined in an adjoining channel ( the nanotube ) of depth @xmath0 much smaller than that of the chamber . </S>",
    "<S> both ` a ' and ` b ' particles are assumed to be charged particles with pairwise screened coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations implement the theoretical ideas of @xcite with an important difference : the ions flowing past the nanotube have a strong velocity gradient in the vicinity of the nanotube , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ modelfigure ] . for a suitable range of shear rates ( magnitude of velocity gradient ) , we find that an imposed flow of the ` a ' particles indeed induces a unidirectional drift in the ` b ' particles in the channel . </S>",
    "<S> the average drift velocity initially rises with increasing shear rate , then shows saturation for a while , and thereafter starts decreasing , in qualitative agreement with the theoretical arguments of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we further observe that the induced drift decreases substantially when @xmath0 is increased , underlining as in the experiments of @xcite , the central role of reduced dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , if the sign of the a - b interaction is reversed , the direction of the induced drift remains the same , in agreement with @xcite , but the flow - rate at which crossover to saturation occurs is lower , and the level of fluctuations is higher . </S>"
