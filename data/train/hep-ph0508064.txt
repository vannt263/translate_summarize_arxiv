    "an old question in the antiprotonic physics is the existence or non - existence of exotic @xmath13 systems : quasi - bound , virtual , resonant , multiquark or baryonium states  @xcite . such states , if located close to the threshold , would generate large scattering lengths for a given spin and isospin state .",
    "the scattering experiments offer the easiest check but a clear separation of quantum states is not easy .",
    "complementary measurements of the x - ray transitions in @xmath14 atoms may select certain partial waves when the level fine structure is resolved .",

    "two studies are presented in this contribution :    @xmath22 the @xmath20 decay mode ( [ 1 ] ) is discussed and the threshold @xmath23 enhancement is attributed to a broad subthreshold state in the @xmath24 wave .    @xmath22 the atomic level shifts are related to the @xmath19-nucleus zero energy scattering parameters @xmath25 . in light atoms the latter are extracted from the @xmath26- , @xmath27he- , @xmath28he - data .",
