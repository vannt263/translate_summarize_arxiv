    "the thomas - ehrman level displacement formalism ( teld )  @xcite is an established technique for calculating the level displacement between mirror pairs .",
    "it is found to be particularly useful in situations where a reaction proceeds via a proton resonant state in a proton - rich nucleus .",
    "largely , this usefulness derives from the fact that such states are above the particle decay threshold , usually resulting in proton partial widths too narrow to be measured experimentally .",
    "thus , by appealling to the charge symmetry of the nuclear force , one may make use of relatively abundant spectroscopic data of analogue states in the mirror nucleus to determine the properties of the astrophysically interesting states .",
    "examples in the literature are the @xmath0ne-@xmath0na  @xcite , @xmath1f-@xmath1na  @xcite , @xmath2o-@xmath2ne  @xcite , @xmath3ne-@xmath3 mg  @xcite and @xmath4ti-@xmath4cr  @xcite mirror nuclear pairs",
    ". however , a survey of the literature finds inconsistency in the definition of critical parameters , leading to errors in the calculations . in the present work a complete and consistent teld formalism",
    "is presented and made available for wider use .",
    "here we reproduce and expand upon the original work of thomas  @xcite , using , for consistency , exactly the same terminology .",
    "the channel radius of two interacting bodies is defined as @xmath5 fm , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the mass numbers of the bodies of the pair ; the reduced mass is @xmath8 ; the energy of relative motion is @xmath9 , which may be positive or negative .",
    "the subscript @xmath10 is used to describe all of the features of the channel , unless it is necessary to distinguish the positive - energy ( @xmath11 ) from the negative - energy ( @xmath12 ) channels in which case the symbols @xmath13 and @xmath14 are used , respectively .    for external wave functions , a radial factor ( equ .",
    "1 of ref  @xcite ) may be written that satisfies the wave equation @xmath15 where a prime signifies differentiation with respect to @xmath16 ( in the following descriptions , all the derivatives are with respect to @xmath16 unless stated otherwise ) .",
    "the interaction potential may be written @xmath17 where the nuclear potential term disappears in the external region . in the notation of yost , wheeler , and breit",
    "@xcite , the positive - energy solution , which is regular at the origin , is designated by @xmath18 and has the asymptotic form for large @xmath16 , @xmath19 likewise , there is a solution which is linearly independent of @xmath20 and irregular at the origin which is conveniently taken with the asymptotic form for large @xmath16 , @xmath21 the quantities entering equ .",
    "[ eq:3 ] and  [ eq:4 ] are @xmath22 with sommerfeld parameter @xmath23 and @xmath24 it is worth noting that @xmath25 is replaced with @xmath26 in some formulations .",
    "the general solution of this equation , @xmath27 , is a linear combination of @xmath20 and @xmath28 .",
    "the wronskian relation for these two particular solutions , which directly follows from equ .",
    "[ eq:1]-  [ eq:4 ] is @xmath29 extensive tables  @xcite and several computer codes  @xcite have been developed for evaluating @xmath20 and @xmath28 and their derivatives when @xmath30 .    for the @xmath14 channels , only the solution to equ .",
    "[ eq:1 ] , vanishing at large distances from the origin , can occur ; it is the whittaker function  @xcite ,    @xmath31    whittaker function and its derivative may be accurately calculated using the whittaker_w  @xcite computer code .",
    "however , it is useful to note that if there is no coulomb interaction in a @xmath14 channel , one has from equ .",
    "[ eq:8 ] for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 orbitals the simpler relations @xmath36 which can be used for checking the results from a more complicated code .    in discussing conditions at the nuclear surface",
    ", one needs to evaluate the real and imaginary parts of the logarithmic derivatives , @xmath37 , and these are @xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "although the simple wkb approximation @xcite can perform well in calculating the logarithmic derivatives of the coulomb and whittaker functions in specified regions , modern computer codes perform essentially exact calculations and are preferred .",
    "for example , the difference between the wkb approximation and the exact evaluation of @xmath41 , performed using the code whittaker_w  @xcite , in the region 0.1@xmath425.0",
    ", 0.1@xmath4310.0 ( roughly corresponding to @xmath4420 and bound nucleon energy 0.1@xmath4510.0 mev ) , can be as large as 3% ( @xmath46=1 ) , 1% ( @xmath46=2 ) and 0.6% ( @xmath46=3 ) , respectively , and becomes smaller as @xmath47 increases . in the case",
    "that @xmath46=0 , the differences can be as much as 10% when @xmath480.1 and @xmath490.9 , or @xmath480.2 and @xmath490.5 , or @xmath480.5 and @xmath490.3 .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that a frequently used subroutine , coulfg  @xcite , was unable to reproduce the results ( @xmath20 , @xmath28 and their derivatives ) of the subroutine rcwfn near values of @xmath50 unless the accur variable was set to be less than @xmath51 ( of course the smaller the safer , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath52 if possible ) .",
    "under the assumption of charge symmetry of nuclear forces , the @xmath53 and @xmath54 nuclear interactions are identical .",
    "the difference in the excitation energy of levels in mirror nuclei is therefore due to differences in the coulomb , electromagnetic spin - orbit , and mass energies . as suggested by  @xcite",
    ", one can evaluate this by considering @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , in the one - level approximation , irrespective of the boundary conditions , in the internal region the proton and neutron wavefunctions are the same to within a multiplicative constant . under these assumptions , one obtains ( equ .",
    "30a in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath56 where there is a boundary condition that satisfies @xmath57 ( defined in equ .",
    "24c of  @xcite ) .",
    "here , @xmath58 is the mean value of @xmath59 in the internal region , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the eigenvalues satisfying @xmath62 of the nucleus with the odd neutron or proton , respectively .",
    "the difference of the level displacements of the neutron and proton states ( see equ .",
    "30b of  @xcite ) , @xmath63 is referred to as the boundary condition level displacement .",
    "the energy difference of corresponding levels of mirror nuclei , following from equ .",
    "[ eq:18 ] and  [ eq:19 ] , can be written as @xmath64 where it is assumed that the quantity @xmath58 is the same in the excited state as in the ground state .",
    "the scripts @xmath65 and _ g.s . _",
    "denote the corresponding quantities are being evaluated with respect to the excited state and the ground state , respectively .",
    "assuming that the level displacements of the two ground states are the same simplifies this relation further ,    @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the corresponding excitation energies in the mirror nuclei .",
    "therefore , the observed energy difference between mirror nuclear states is due to different level displacements , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , in the two nuclei .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we find that the definitions used by various authors of partial width @xmath71 , reduced width @xmath72 , dimensionless reduced width @xmath73 and dimensionless single - particle reduced width @xmath74  @xcite , of a level @xmath75 , are not consistent , as shown in table  [ table1 ] . following the previous work , the definitions of french  @xcite are adopted in the present work , though it is possible to achieve consistency using the alternative definitions  @xcite .",
    "one should pay attention that the definition of @xmath72  @xcite is different from that of  @xcite by a factor of @xmath76 .",
    "thus , for the positive - energy channel , @xmath77 with the coulomb penetrability @xmath78 ; and for the negative - energy channel , @xmath79 where @xmath80,@xmath81 and @xmath82 represent differentiation with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "[ eq:22 ] &  [ eq:23 ] were defined as @xmath83 and @xmath84 in previous literature by assuming @xmath85 ( see fig .  [ prcfig1 ] ) .",
    "the reasonable assumption that the reduced widths , @xmath86 , are the same for the mirror levels leads to an assumption of @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the excitation - energy displacements of mirror nuclei can be expressed as @xmath88_{\\mid e = e_r}- \\left(x\\frac{w_{x}^\\prime}{w}\\right)_{\\mid e = e_b } \\right\\ } , \\label{eq:24}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 [ = @xmath90 and @xmath91 [ = @xmath92 are the energies relative to the respective nucleon thresholds ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ; the superscripts @xmath33 and @xmath95 refer to the odd - proton ( or proton - rich ) and odd - neutron ( or neutron - rich ) nuclei , respectively ; the subscripts @xmath33 and @xmath95 denote the corresponding nucleon separation energies ) . a pictorial representation of the physical meanings of the parameters described here",
    "are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ prcfig1 ] which shows the case of the 6.424  mev state in @xmath4ti and its analogue state in @xmath4cr  @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the level displacement may equally well be written as , @xmath96-[e^\\ast(p)-s_p^p]=e_b^\\prime - e_r , \\label{eq:25}\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath97 is different from that of @xmath91 defined above .",
    "it appears that confusion over these definitions has , in part , been the source of errors in the past .",
    "for example , in several previous works  @xcite the level displacement has been written as @xmath98 in contrast to the correct expression of @xmath99 which follows from marion _ et al . _",
    "however , the pressent work validates that the correct expression was used in the calculations  @xcite .     definitions and calculation results of relevant quantities in case of the @xmath4ti-@xmath4cr mirror pair .",
    "the calculated values ( in units of mev ) are with respect to the analogue states at 6.424 mev ( in @xmath4ti ) and 6.246 mev ( in @xmath4cr )  @xcite.,width=264 ]    the final ingredient which is needed to allow calculation of the level shift is the dimensionless reduced width , @xmath100 .",
    "this can be calculated according to the relation @xmath100=c@xmath101s@xmath74",
    "@xcite , where the dimensionless single - particle reduced width @xmath74 has already been determined  @xcite , and the factor c@xmath101s is calculated via a shell - model code such as oxbash  @xcite .",
    "the algorithms developed here have been made available online  @xcite .",
    "the visual basic tool requires the teld_vb and teld executables be in the same directory . opening the teld application provides a window in which one defines the parameters of the mirror states to be considered ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "one also could change values for the channel radius , the orbital angular momentum of the single particle and spectroscopic factor for the state .",
    "activation of the  calc \" button then performs the teld formalism and returns the resulting excitation of the proton - rich analogue state and the proton decay width for this state .",
    "this last parameter is calculated using the relation @xmath107 in addition , a fortran source code , which allows users to make changes whenever required , is also encloded in the teld.rar package .",
