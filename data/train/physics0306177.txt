    "recently , nonlinear dynamical systems with random noise have been paid much attention both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "phenomena such as noise - induced transitions , stochastic resonance , resonant activation , noise - induced spatial patterns are a few examples of extensive investigations @xcite@xcite@xcite . in most of these areas",
    "the noise affects the dynamics through system variables , i.e. , the noise is multiplicative in nature @xcite .",
    "the focal theme of these types investigation is the steady state properties of systems in which the fluctuations , generally applied from outside , are considered , independent of the system s characteristic dissipation . on the level of a langevin - type description of a dynamical system ,",
    "the presence of noise can change the dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "noise processes have found applications in a broad range of studies , such as the steady state properties of a single mode laser @xcite , bistable kinetics @xcite , directed motion in spatially symmetric periodic potentials @xcite , stochastic resonance in linear systems @xcite , and steady state entropy production @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study an insect outbreak model in the presence of the correlated noise , and show how noise can dynamically affect the ecosystem .",
    "a practical model which exhibits two positive linearly steady state populations is that for the spruce budworm , which can , with ferocous efficiency , defoliate the balsam fir .",
    "they are major problem in canada @xcite , ludwing @xcite ( 1978 ) considered the budworm population dynamics to be governed by the equation + @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the linear birth rate of the budworm and @xmath5 is carrying capacity which is related to the density of the foliage available on trees .",
    "the @xmath6 term represents predation , generated by birds .",
    "we take the form for @xmath6 suggested by ludwing ( 1978 ) , namely @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a positive constant and @xmath9 represents the predation rate of the birds .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath10 is then governed by + @xmath11 before analysing the model we will express it in nondimensional terms . here",
    "we introduce nondimensional quantities by + @xmath12 upon on substitution ( 2 ) becomes + @xmath13 now , if some environmental external disturbances make both the birth rate and the predation rate fluctuate , it is likely to affect @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the form of multiplicative noises that are connected through a correlation parameter @xmath16 . as a result",
    "we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19are gaussian white noises with the following properties : + @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are",
    "the strength of noise @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , and @xmath16 denotes the degree of correlation between @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath26 .",
    "+ we can derive the corresponding fokker - planck equation for evolution of steady probability distribution ( spdf ) based on eq .",

    "the curve shows three @xmath47 values at @xmath46 . from the figure",
    "we can see that the noise strength can change the state of the system .",
    "+ in fig.2 we show the effect of the noise strength @xmath24 on the spdf . for a small value of @xmath24",
    ", the spdf shows a single peak region , which changes for larger values of @xmath24 ( see fig.2 ) . as the value of @xmath24 increases , the peak for the larger values of @xmath47 decreases . at the same time , for small values of @xmath47 , a new peak appears .",
    "it can be said that the noise causes the system become from two states to one state , namely noise can induce a phase transition . on the other hand , since @xmath47 , @xmath24 give the relative budworm population and the fluctuation of the budworm s birth rate , respectively , we can see from the figure the effect the fluctuation of the birth rate makes on the growth of budworms , they can even make the budworms go into extinction .",
    "+    [ fig2 ]",
    "on the other hand , if only the fluctuation of predation rate is investigated , namely @xmath48 and @xmath36 we can get the stationary probability distribution function similar to eq.(14 ) + @xmath49,\\ ] ] where + @xmath50 @xmath51 in order to discuss the effect of the fluctuation of the predation rate on the system we adopt @xmath52 , the results are shown in fig.3 .",

    "since @xmath47 denotes the budworm relative population , it is clear from fig.3 that , with an increase in the fluctuations of the predation rate , the budworm recover from going into extinction .",

    "since the two type of fluctuations have the common origin , ( environmental external disturbance ) , we will consider the effect of the correlation between the birth rate fluctuation and the predation rate fluctuation .",

    "for a small @xmath16 value the spdf shows a typical bistable region which will vanish for the large value of @xmath16 . as the correlation parameter increases the height of the peak on the small @xmath47 value decreases , while the height of the peak on the large @xmath47 value increases , namely probabilities flow from the small @xmath47 value to the large @xmath47 value .",
    "since @xmath47 denotes the budworm relative population , it is clear from fig .",
    "4 that the correlation of the noises is a advantageous factor for the growth of the budworm .    [ fig4 ]",
    "in this paper , we studied the steady state properties of an insect outbreak model in the presence of the correlated noise .",
    "birth rate fluctuation , predation rate fluctuation and the correlation of the noises are investigated .",
    "birth rate fluctuation work against the growth of the budworm population , while both fluctuation of the predation rate and the correlation of the noises can prevent the budworm population from going into extinction . on the other hand",
    ", noise can dynamically affect the ecosystem .",
    "the noise from the birth rate fluctuation can make the system change from a single steady state to a bistable state , while noise from the predation rate fluctuation induces the system change from a bistable state to a single steady state .",
    "thus in the insect outbreak model , noise from the fluctuation of the parameters can induce a phase transition .",
    "this viewpoint is completely novel in the traditional viewpoint it is the stochastic force that disturbs the phase transition .",
