    "there are various reasons supporting the natural appearance of the `` square - root '' maxwell term in effective gauge field actions .",
    "originally , a pure `` square - root '' lagrangian in flat space - time @xmath9 was proposed by nielsen and olesen @xcite , such ",
    "square root gauge field theory `` has been shown to give rise to string solutions and therefore provides a theory which includes strings as special types of excitations , while containing other types of excitations as well @xcite .",
    "we notice , however , that this action is designed to be applicable only to ' ' magnetic dominated \" configuration , for electric dominated configuration the square root becomes imaginary .",
    "furthermore , g.  t hooft @xcite has shown that in any effective quantum gauge field theory , which is able to describe a linear confinement phenomena , the energy density of electrostatic field configurations should be a linear function of the electric displacement field in the infrared region ( the latter appearing as an  infrared counterterm \" ) .",
    "a simple way to realize this idea in minkowski space - time is by considering a non - linear effective gauge field model , which has an additional term of the form of square root of the standard maxwell lagrangian in the effective action .",
    "@xmath10 this lagrangian contains both the usual maxwell term and a non - analytic function of @xmath11 , it is thus a _ non - standard _ form of non - linear electrodynamics , which is significantly different from the original purely `` square root '' lagrangian ( [ eq : nando ] ) first proposed by nielsen and olesen .",
    "the variation of this action with respect to @xmath12 field produces the following equation @xmath13 = 0 % \\frac{\\partial } { { \\partial x^\\mu   } } \\left ( { \\omega \\frac{{f^{\\mu \\nu } } } { { \\sqrt { - f_{\\alpha \\beta } f^{\\alpha \\beta } } } } } \\right ) =    \\label{eq : sib9}\\ ] ] in order to illustrate that this lagrangian satisfies ",
    "t hooft criteria for theories describing confinement , we will study equation ( [ eq : sib9 ] ) for the case of a spherically symmetric electric field @xmath14 equation ( [ eq : sib9 ] ) is , then , solved by a scalar potential @xmath15 of the form @xmath16 this has a coulomb part plus a linear contribution which is of the form of the well - known `` cornell '' potential @xcite which was postulated in order to simulate the features of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "also , for static field configurations the model ( [ eq : gg ] ) has the following energy density @xmath17 this contains a term linear with respect to @xmath18 as argued by ` t hooft . the square root of the maxwell term can also naturally arise , in flat space - time , as a result of spontaneous breakdown of scale symmetry of the original scale - invariant maxwell theory with @xmath19 appearing as an integration constant responsible for the latter spontaneous breakdown@xcite , to show this we will start with a theory which is invariant under scale symmetry @xmath20 another way to write ( [ eq : sib1 ] ) is with the use an auxiliary field , @xmath21 , in the following form @xmath22 } \\label{eq : sib3}\\ ] ] this definition introduces a new degree of freedom , the three index potential and it generates the 4-index field strength @xmath23}$ ] . preforming the variation of this new action with respect to the three field yields the following equation of motion for @xmath24 @xmath25 when integrated we get @xmath26 the integration constant @xmath19 spontaneously breaks the scale invariance , since both @xmath21 and @xmath27 transform under scale transformation but @xmath19 does not has the same dimensions as the field strength @xmath28 , that is , dimensions of @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , the variation of ( [ eq : sib3 ] ) with respect to the @xmath30 field , together with ( [ eq : sib8 ] ) , a non - abelian generalization of ( [ eq : sib9 ] ) . to see what are the application and properties of this non - linear maxwell term in curved space time , we will begin by coupling ( [ eq : gg ] ) to ordinary einstein - gravity .",
    "one example is shown in [ ] , where the square root ' of the maxwell term @xmath31 was coupled with gravity in order to search for possible linear potentials such the ones found in flat - space ( [ eq : sib13 ] ) .",
    "the authors found that in the presence of magnetic charges ( @xmath32 ) no confining potential exists and they concluded by saying that magnetic charges acts agent confinement . on the other hand , confining field solutions are found for pure electrically charged ( @xmath33 ) configuration , where one finds nariai- bertotti - robinson ( nbr ) space - time with constant scalar curvature . in these space - times",
    "the confining potentials exist whether the standard maxwell term , @xmath34 , is present or absent .",
    "a @xmath35dimensional version of einstein gravity coupled to non - linear maxwell theory was studied in [ ] .",
    "the authors examined the case of constant , circularly symmetric , electric field configuration @xmath36 , while the lagrangian considered was a power law of the standard maxwell invariant @xmath37 for @xmath38 the authors give two different classes of solutions , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the first one , @xmath39 , is found to be similar to a black hole solution , with a singularity at @xmath41 , namely , the curvature invariants @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the kretschmann scalar are all divergent as @xmath4 approaches zero @xmath44 in addition they find the singularity at the origin , @xmath41 , is also a zero for @xmath45 which makes the solution a black point that confines the radial motion of a massive particles both charged and uncharged .",
    "this coincides with the solutions in @xmath46 dimensions of gravity coupled with a massless , self - interacting real scalar field @xcite .",
    "the second case , @xmath47 ( @xmath38 ) , corresponds to a non - asymptotically flat wormhole built entirely from the cosmological constant .    here",
    "we will show a ",
    "charge hiding \" behaviour opposite to the famous misner - wheeler `` charge without charge '' effect @xcite , in which wormholes connecting two asymptotically flat space times provide the possibility of having a non - trivial electromagnetic solutions , where the lines of force of the electric field flow from one universe to the other , without a source , giving the impression of being positively charged in one universe and negatively charged in the other universe .",
    "in contrast , the charge hiding effect , will cause a genuinely charged matter source of gravity and electromagnetism to appear electrically neutral to an external observer . in order to show this we will first find two solutions of the resulting field equations and match these solution on a light - like @xcite , and subsequently time - like branes @xcite , thin shells of matter and charge . in the case",
    "where light - like branes are present as the source of charge in the system , sitting at the throat , there is at the throat a surface of infinite red - shift for the coordinate time , so the wormhole is accessible only according to the weaker definition that a  traveller \" attempting to cross from one side of the wormhole throat to the other side can do so in a finite proper time . if we want to assure the more stringent definition of transversability or accessibility , we must have time - like branes .",
    "we will see , however , that these wormhole , or horned - particle , solutions lead to a violation of some energy conditions , indicating the presence of exotic matter at the throat , which can be of quantum mechanical origin .",
    "next we will consider the coupling of ( [ eq : gg ] ) to extended theories of gravity @xcite , where a non - linear function of the scalar curvature @xmath42 and of other higher - order invariants of the riemann curvature tensor , such as @xmath48 , are included in the gravitational action , in addition one may also include a dilaton field , @xmath49 , to implement scale invariance .",
    "these kind of theories are attracting a lot of interest as possible candidates to resolve problems in the standard cosmological models related to dark matter and dark energy , where the higher - order curvature terms usually arise in approaches to quantum gravity and in the quantization of fields in curved space - time . here",
    "we will consider the following extended theories@xmath50 the case of a standard maxwell theory coupled to these kind of extended theories of gravity , in @xmath51dimensions , was studied in detail in [  ] where it was found that the internal point - like singularity that typically arises in the reissner - nordstrm solution of gr is generically replaced by a region of finite non - zero area that represents the throat of a wormhole .",
    "the existence of this wormhole is an effect of the modified gravitational dynamics since the electromagnetic field does not violate any of the classical energy conditions .",
    "therefore , these kind of theories can produce wormhole solutions without requiring exotic matter to support them .",
    "the final demonstration will be for the  two measure theory \" ( tmt ) .",
    "the tmt models consider two measures of integration in the action , the standard @xmath7 where @xmath52 is the determinant of the metric and another measure @xmath8 independent of the metric tensor @xcite .",
    "our focus , here , will be on the interplay between gauge field dynamics ( [ eq : gg ] ) and the tmt to see whether the possibility of obtaining a confinement phase and a deconfined phase ( like in the mit bag model @xcite ) can be addressed in this context .",
    "when dealing with extended theories of gravity we will choose to relax the levi - civita condition on the connection @xmath53 , and obtain the field equations following the palatini approach , in which metric and connection are regarded as two physically independent entities .",
    "this implies that both metric and connection must be determined by solving their respective equations obtained through the application of the variational principle on the action .",
    "we will start by considering the simplest coupling to gravity of the nonlinear gauge field system with a square root of the maxwell term ( [ eq : gg ] ) .",
    "the relevant action , which can also contain a cosmological constant , is given by the following expression @xmath54 \\quad , \\quad l(f^2 ) = - \\frac{1}{4 } f^2 - \\frac{f}{2 } \\sqrt{\\varepsilon f^2 } \\label{eq : gravity+gg } \\\\ & f^2 \\equiv f_{\\alpha\\beta } f_{\\mu\\nu } g^{\\alpha\\mu } g^{\\beta\\nu } \\quad , \\quad   f_{\\mu\\nu } = \\partial_\\mu a_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu a_\\mu \\end{alignedat}\\ ] ] here @xmath55 is the scalar curvature of the space - time metric @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; the sign factor @xmath58 in the square - root term in ( [ eq : gravity+gg ] ) corresponds to `` magnetic '' or `` electric '' dominance ; @xmath19 is a positive coupling constant .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion read : @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 next we will look for two kinds of spherically symmetric solutions of this set of equations .",
    "we will be interested in the `` electric '' sector of the theory , so @xmath62 henceforth .",
    "it is of course possible to allows magnetic dominated configurations by choosing @xmath63 ( as we will see in section ( [ magnetic dominance ] ) ) , or by taking absolute value inside the square root , but this will be harder to motivate , for example from spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale invariance , furthermore we have already mentioned that , when considering only  square - root \" term in the action , purely magnetic configurations will act against confinement .",
    "first we look for static spherically symmetric solutions of the reissner - nordstrm - de - sitter type , in the same manner to those found for the ordinary maxwell theory ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "when looking for static , spherically symmetric configurations we have the following forms of the metric tensor and the gauge field strength : @xmath65 @xmath66 and the solution of the gauge field equations of motion ( [ eq : gg - eqs ] ) reads : @xmath67 namely , the electric field contain a radial constant piece alongside the coulomb term .",
    "so the property of a linear  confining - like \" potential ( [ eq : sib13 ] ) , which was found in flat space - time , is also present when the system ( [ eq : gg ] ) is coupled to gravity .    for the metric part",
    ", it is known that for static spherically symmetric metrics with the associated energy - momentum tensor obeying the condition @xmath68 , which is fulfilled in the present case ( [ eq : electr - static-1 ] ) , it is sufficient to solve einstein equations : @xmath69 @xmath70 in the case under consideration ( [ eq : cornell - sol ] ) the solution of ( [ eq : ed - rab ] ) and ( [ eq : ed - rab1 ] ) yields : @xmath71 this is a reissner - nordstrm - de - sitter - type spacetime with a _ dynamically generated _ effective cosmological constant @xmath72 . in the presence of the bare cosmological constant term in ( [ eq : gravity+gg ] ) the only effect",
    "is shifting of the effective cosmological constant .",
    "the appearance in ( [ eq : rn - ds+const - electr ] ) of a `` leading '' constant term different from @xmath73 resembles the effect on gravity produced by a spherically symmetric `` hedgehog '' configuration of a non - linear sigma - model scalar field with @xmath74 symmetry , that is the field of a global monopole @xcite .",
    "next we will look for static solutions of levi - civita - bertotti - robinson type @xcite of the system ( [ eq : einstein - eqs])([eq : gg - eqs ] ) , namely , with space - time geometry of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath75 is some two - dimensional manifold : @xmath76 where @xmath77 in what follows we will find solutions for both purely electric and purely magnetic configurations of the non - linear gauge field system .",
    "for both cases the metric will have the form ( [ eq : gen - br - metric ] ) , the difference is manifested in the form of the field strength tensor @xmath78 and the _ sign _ of @xmath79 in ( [ eq : gravity+gg ] ) .      for purely electric dominated configurations , where @xmath62 in ( [ eq : gravity+gg ] )",

    "solutions ( [ eq : rindler2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ds2 ] ) with @xmath109 are new ones and are specifically due to the presence of the , non - linear , maxwell square - root term in the gauge field lagrangian ( [ eq : gravity+gg ] ) .      for purely magnetic dominated configurations , where @xmath110 in ( [ eq : gravity+gg ] ) , the field strength tensor is of the form : @xmath111 the gauge field equations of motion ( [ eq : gg - eqs ] ) yield magnetic monopole solution : @xmath112 irrespective of the presence of the `` square - root '' maxwell term .",

    "<S> we present a review , of recent developments on non - linear gauge theory containing a @xmath0 term coupled to gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we start by showing some of the confining features of this theory in flat space - time . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the coupling , of this non - linear term , to gravity and discuss two types of spherically symmetric solutions . </S>",
    "<S> one of them has a tube topology , that is @xmath1 , or of the levi - civitta - robinson - berttoti ( lcrb ) type , where the metric coefficient @xmath2 is a constant . the other type of solutions , reissner - nordstrm - de - sitter ( rnds ) , with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a radial variable allowed to have all values from zero to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> next we consider the matching of these solutions via light - like , and subsequently , time - like membranes and show the topologically induced effects of  hiding of charge \" , where a charged particle can appear neutral to an external observer looking at it from the rnds region , and the  confining of charge \" in a wormhole throat , where two opposite charges are at the opposite sides of a wormhole throats . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed with some applications to extended theories of general relativity , in the form of quadratic gravity model ( @xmath5 ) , then wormholes arise naturally from the non - linear electromagnetic field rather than requiring exotic matter to generate a pre - designed wormhole geometry ( morris - thorne approach ) , in another model considered here we have , in addition to quadratic gravity , a dilaton filed @xmath6 ) , where we find wormhole solutions with de - sitter asymptotics , and _ confinement - deconfinement _ transition effects as function of the dilaton vacuum expectation value . </S>",
    "<S> the last application we present is to the  two measure theory \" , where in addition to the metric volume element , @xmath7 , we consider a new , metric independent , volume element @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> finally we conclude and summarize our findings . </S>"
