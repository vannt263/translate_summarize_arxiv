    "accretion and clustering are the most fundamental aspects of ob star formation ( see garay & lizano 1999 , mckee & ostriker 2007 and zinnecker & yorke 2007 for reviews ) .",
    "ob stars are observed to form in very special regions of molecular clouds  massive molecular clumps , typically of parsec scale in size .",
    "large mass and high density are needed for the accretion flow to feed the forming massive stars as well as the associated stellar cluster at a high enough rate .",
    "however , how the massive clumps form , whether the internal conditions of the massive clumps facilitate the accretion process , and how the massive clumps fragment into clusters , are still open questions . in the present work ,",
    "we improve our understanding of these issues observationally , using the submillimeter array ( sma ; ho , moran , & lo 2004 ) and the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "we focus on the well studied uc hii region g10.6 - 0.4 , for which a wealth of complementary data are available to help address these questions .",

    "observations of the 20 cm continuum emission using the nrao very large array ( vla ) unveil a @xmath65 pc scale ionized bubble to the north of the brightest ob cluster , which suggests that the evolution of the cloud can be affected by the impact of the hii region projected close to g10.60.4 ( ho , klein & haschick 1986 ) .",

    "a similar geometry in the central 1 pc scale is also resolved in the luminous ( l@xmath66.6@xmath810@xmath4 l@xmath1 ) massive cluster forming region g20.08 - 0.14 n ( galvn - madrid et al .",
    "2009 ) .    the high resolution spectral line observations further show the clumpiness and the spatial asymmetry of the mass and the velocity field at a scale of 0.5 pc ( liu et al . 2010 ; liu , zhang & ho 2011 ) .",
    "this asymmetric flow appears to have a spin  up rotational motion , and might continue to the highly clumpy 0.1 pc scale , flattened , hot toroid , which was first resolved by the nh@xmath9 optical depth studies .",
    "the hot toroid has a high temperature and should immediately surround the central 200 m@xmath1 ob cluster ( sollins & ho 2005 ; liu et al .",

    "observations of the radio recombination lines suggest that part of the material that is ionized by the embedded ob stars can continue across the hii boundary , to feed the embedded ob stars ( keto 2002 ; keto & wood 2006 ) .",
    "despite the rich literatures in the studies of the kinematics in the inner 1 pc region , how the parsec scale massive molecular clump connects to the more extended structure , how the massive clumps form , and how the detailed morphology and dynamics lead to the fragmentation and the formation of a cluster , remain unanswered questions . to improve the understanding in these aspects , we observed the 1.2 mm continuum emission in a 10 pc scale area using the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "at such a large scale , the 1.2 mm continuum emission is dominated by the thermal dust emission .",
    "the large dish of the iram 30 m telescope allows us to resolve the dust emission , and simultaneously provides the short  spacing information , to complement the sma data . this yields high resolution and high dynamic range images for our morphological studies .",
    "in addition , we observed the dust polarization properties at the 0.87 mm wavelength using the sma , to gauge the role of the magnetic field in the formation of the massive molecular clump .",
    "for a few 1.2 mm clumps resolved in the iram 30 m observations , we followed up with the sma at 0.87 mm , in order to resolve their internal structures and subsequent fragmentation .",
    "we also compare the large scale 1.2 mm continuum emission with the spitzer mipsgal 24 @xmath0 m map and the glimpse 8 @xmath0 m map .",
    "the diffuse 24 @xmath0 m and 8 @xmath0 m emissions mainly trace the ionized gas and the photon  dominant regions ( pdr ) at the boundary of the neutral material .",
    "these comparisons help to define the locations and the effects of both the embedded and the external ionizing sources .",
    "we retrieved the archived vla 20 cm continuum data and the 3.6 cm and 1.3 cm continuum data to trace the diffuse and the confined ionized gas in the observed area .",

    "a blow  up view of the iram 30 m 1.2 mm continuum map overlaid with the vla 20 cm continuum map is provided in figure [ fig_bubble ] .",
    "the distribution of the 20 cm continuum emission suggests that the 1.2 mm emission from the patchy molecular gas are not contaminated by the free  free emission .",
    "this patchy molecular gas shows rich subparsec scale structures . with our current data , how these patchy structures form , and",
    "if they are interacting with the ionized bubble or the hii region , are unclear .",
    "we suspect that they are naked dense cores which lost their ambient gas through some interactions ; or they can be some foreground , isolated , subparsec scale molecular cloudlets .",
    "these have to be distinguished in future observations .",
    "from figure [ fig_rgb ] , we see the formation of the ob stars over the entire @xmath510 pc projected area .",
    "the formation of these ob stars seems to be synchronized on a time interval , which is short in the sense that it takes @xmath2910@xmath30 years to propagate the sound wave in this @xmath610 pc cloud .",
    "this propagation timescale is much longer than the collapsing timescale plus the life time of the massive stars .",
    "the alfvn waves can propagate supersonically .",
    "however , they will be restricted by the detailed magnetic field line configurations and the magnetic field strength .    are there large scale physical phenomena , which are globally regulating or triggering the local structure formations ( e.g. the formation of the massive core , or the collapsing of the massive cores , etc ) ?",
    "the impulse from the hii region in the northeast might be a candidate of this global mechanism , which was suggested by ho , klein & haschick ( 1986 ) with their vla 20 cm continuum observations .",
    "this scenario has to be tested by the numerical hydrodynamical simulations .      with the 1.2 mm dust continuum maps",
    ", one may argue that the filamentary geometry of the neutral material could be a projection effect . in this section ,",
    "we present the case of the ionizing pattern around the parsec scale filament in the south , and the massive cluster o ( figure [ fig_rgb ] ) , to argue in favor of the elongated geometry of the parsec scale structures .",
    "while fragmentation in filamentary infrared dark clouds are ubiquitously seen , we argue that our result provides hints for their evolutionary context .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that there are edge  on sheets which in projection appear like filaments .",
    "however , it is questionable whether a @xmath205 pc scale sheet is likely at such a late evolutionary stage where clusters of smaller structures and massive stars are already present .",
    "the idea is that if there is an ob cluster located close to the parsec scale massive filaments ( with a gradient of volume density along the radius ) , its ionizing photons and stellar wind will be blocked in the direction of the dense neutral material .",
    "the uv photons emanating from the ob stars will only efficiently ionize the outer edges of the filament .",
    "if the filament presents a small solid angle to the ob cluster , most of the uv photons , the stellar wind and the ionized gas will flow around the filament , and form a * u * shaped free ",
    "free continuum emission region .",
    "such a * u * shape illumination pattern is seen around the massive filament in the south ( figure [ fig_ionized ] ) . if that filament were just filamentary in projection , but is an extended smoothed sheet in reality , we do not expect to see the ionized gas penetrating to the northeast of it ; instead , the free  free emission should be limited to the southwest .",
    "alternatively , the * u * shape illumination pattern can also be explained by the addition of two photoionized molecular filaments .",
    "this scenario can be examined by deeper observations of thermal dust emission with higher angular resolution .",
    "we note that the cloud with a filamentary morphology may be self  shielded from an ob cluster deeply embedded in the geometrical center of the cloud .",
    "while the parsec scale filament in the south is illuminated by the massive cluster o and shows significant 8 @xmath0 m emission ( figure [ fig_rgb ] ) , the filament in the east remains dark at 8 @xmath0 m . if there are smaller and denser filaments continuing to the centrally embedded ob cluster , the small cross  sections of the filamentary accretion flow is minimally affected by the radiation from the luminous ob cluster , and the pressure force of the ionized gas . therefore , it is conducive for the accretion of the massive stars .",
    "previous observations have suggested that the major , massive filaments can be formed from the merging of the smaller ones ( jimnez - serra et al .",
    "the filaments may also collide with each other , which is conducive for the formation of cores and the massive stars ( galvn - madrid et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "at 10 pc scale , the filamentary morphology has a low volume filling factor , or a high porosity even after being projected onto a 2dimensional observing area .",
    "the intensity ratios of molecular gas tracers ( e.g. hcn / co ) can then be easily converted to volume filling factors ( e.g. dense gas volume filling factor ) as in extragalactic studies . from figures",
    "[ fig_contour ] , [ fig_ionized ] , and figure [ fig_condensations ] , we see concentration of dense gas in the form of massive molecular clumps and molecular cores .",
    "the volume densities of these clumps and cores ( tables [ table_mm ] , [ table_submm ] ) are high enough to excite the dense gas tracers cs , hco@xmath31 , hcn , and h@xmath32co .",
    "the parsec scale filaments , especially the two in the south and in the east , show rich marginally resolved 1.2 mm substructures , the millimeter clumps ( figure [ fig_contour ] ) .",
    "the clumps in the eastern filament show the generally stronger 1.2 mm emission than those in the southern filament , which can be due to their difference in mass , temperature , or the dust properties .",
    "this can be further examined by observing the nh@xmath9 emission with multiple transitions , and by observing the dust continuum emission in multiple frequency bands .",
    "at least three massive clumps in the eastern filament may be forming massive stars , and show bright 8 @xmath0 m point sources around the region we label cluster l ( figure [ fig_rgb ] ) .",
    "clumps in the southern and the eastern filaments seem to be regularly separated by 0.51 pc , implying a scale length for the local contractions which may be related to the length and width of the filaments . in the clumps mm1 and mm2 , our follow up sma observations have resolved much more submillimeter cores , which have an averaged projected separation comparable to the thermal jeans length ( section [ chap_mm ] , figure [ fig_condensations ] ) .",
    "compared with other high resolution interferometric observations of filamentary infrared dark clouds , it is likely that hierarchical fragmentation is common . undoubtedly , there will be more blended substructures in our iram 30 m map due to the still insufficient angular resolution .",
    "for example , in the case study of the infrared dark cloud g28.34 + 0.06 ( @xmath334.8 kpc ; wang et al .",
    "2008 ; zhang et al . 2009",
    "; wang et al . 2011 ) , the 1.3 mm continuum observation of sma resolved five cores within a single local maximum in the iram 30 m 1.2 mm continuum map .",
    "we note that the submillimeter cores in the molecular clumps mm 1 and mm 2 ( figure [ fig_condensations ] ) are not randomly distributed , but are aligned linearly , forming the main axis of the filament . that the successive fragmentation at even smaller scales , continue to be aligned along the filaments ,",
    "suggests a common process .",
    "the process of fragmentation into clumps can be regulated by the density , mass concentration , the geometry or the morphology of the clump , the local magnetic field structure , the local feedback and the ambient pressure , the velocity field , interactions , and so on .",
    "successive fragmentation takes place as the local conditions change .",
    "furthermore , collision or merging of filaments may also be an important process .",
    "we postpone the detailed statistical studies of these cores until we obtain follow up observations that achieve the physical resolution of @xmath340.1 pc , and achieve a much better sensitivity to recover the solar mass or smaller substructures .",
    "some of the parsec scale filaments appear to converge into the geometric center of a 23 pc scale densest structure .",
    "the abundance of protrusions in both the iram 30 m 1.2 mm continuum map , and the combined iram 30 m + sma 1.2 mm continuum map ( figure [ fig_contour ] ) support such a scenario .",
    "we note however that the massive stars are distributed over the entire 10 pc area .",
    "hence , it appears that the star formation process may be driven by local processes , and may not be related to inflow from large scales via the filaments .",
    "we provide simple arguments based on the global and the local free  fall timescale , to justify that the filamentary accretion flows with a radial alignment will allow efficient fragmentation during the quick global contraction .",
    "theories on how contractions depend on morphology , geometry , and initial conditions , are described by ledoux ( 1951 ) , ostriker ( 1964 ) , larson ( 1985 ) , vishnaic ( 1994 ) , whitworth et al .",

    "our estimates specifically focus on the materials in the central 2 pc region ( i.e. inside the sma primary beam shown in figure [ fig_2panel ] ) , in which we see a concentration of bright infrared point sources ( figure [ fig_rgb ] ) .",
    "we do not consider the magnetic field in our estimates , which is consistent with our observations that strong and organized magnetic fields may not be present at the sampled sizescales ( see also section [ chap_mag ] ) . with some rescaling , the same calculations can be applied to the more extended area while a lack of understanding of the large scale initial turbulence brings large uncertainties .",
    "the free  fall timescale is inversely proportional to the square root of the averaged density @xmath35 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 can be estimated by @xmath36 while @xmath37 is the radius around a local center of mass , and @xmath38 is the total mass enclosed in the radius @xmath37 . for the case of g10.60.4 ,",
    "in the central 2 pc region , we have resolved @xmath68 protrusions ( figure [ fig_2panel ] ) . assuming a filamentary geometry for those protrusions , of which the width is a fraction of a parsec , say 0.10.3 pc",

    "the volume filling factor in the inner 2 pc region can be approximately estimated by @xmath44 if we project all structures along the line  of  sight , we can also estimate the surface filling factor , which is @xmath550% .",
    "we note that the smaller beam filling factor of 30% reported in the previous low resolution nh@xmath9 observations ( keto , ho , & haschick ) , suggests that most of the mass are concentrated to filaments or in the central massive core .",
    "the estimated small volume filling factor implies potentially a much higher local volume density than the averaged volume density in that region . within the region enclosed by the 1 pc radius ,",
    "the free  fall contraction timescale of the local perturbations can be a factor of 1.95.8 times shorter than the global free  fall contraction timescale .",
    "depending on the support of the rotational velocities , the timescale of the large scale contraction could be a few times longer than the global free  fall contraction timescale ( ho & haschick 1986 ; keto , ho & haschick 1987 , 1988 ; keto 1990 ; liu et al .",
    "2010 ; liu , zhang & ho 2011 ) .",
    "thus we suggest that although the system may have a quick global contraction ( see also the _ clump  fed _ scenario in wang et al . 2010 ) , the existence of small scale structures implies that efficient fragmentation and subsequent star formation may have already occurred .",

    "note that on such a small scale , the filaments do not need to be primordial nor a continuation of the outer structures .",

    "such a polarization percentage is lower than the reported polarization percentages in those previous cases .",
    "if g10.6 - 0.4 is a strongly magnetized case , the low polarized flux can be interpreted by some differences in the dust properties from the other targets , which produce less polarized flux , the relatively inefficient dust alignment in g10.60.4 , and/or the canceling of the polarized emission from structures overlapped along the line  of  sight .",
