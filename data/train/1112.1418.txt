    "identifying the `` missing baryons '' is one of the major tasks of modern cosmology .",
    "observations of the microwave background ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the big bang nucleosythesis model combined with the measurement of deuterium abundance ( e.g. , @xcite ) are converging on the cosmological baryon density of @xmath17 . at high redshift ( @xmath18 ) universe , baryons exist primarily in the form of cool , photoionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) that is traced by ly@xmath19 absorption forest lines @xcite . in the present - day universe ,",
    "matter detected in forms of photoionized igm , stars , galaxies , intracluster medium , etc . , adds up to only @xmath20 of the baryons @xcite , leaving much of the inventory yet to be found @xcite .",
    "cosmological numerical simulations for large - structure formation indicate that the missing baryons are still in the igm , but at current epoch they have been heated by gravitational shocks and galactic feedback to temperatures of @xmath0 k when they fall into the gravitational potential wells of the dark matter cosmic web filaments ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the igm at these temperatures , so - called warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , mainly absorbs and emits photons in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray wavelength bands .",
    "searching for the missing baryons has been conducted extensively in the uv band . indeed , besides the cool phase ly@xmath19 absorbers ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the absorption lines of , , , , , and   have been routinely observed in spectra of background quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ; e.g. , @xcite ) , suggesting that a significant amount of baryons exist in the highly ionized absorbers .",
    "these high ions ,  in particular , are believed to trace the whim at the low - temperature end ( @xmath21 k ) .",
    "however , all these ions can also be produced through photoionization in the intergalactic environment ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite and @xcite for a contrary view ) and thus some of them may not contribute to the canonical whim ( i.e. , the shock - heated igm expected from simulations ) .",
    "how many of these absorbers originate in the real whim is still under debate @xcite .  and broad  ly@xmath19 absorbers ( blas ) are complementary and valuable tracers of hot absorbing whim in uv bands . however , there are only a few detections with marginal significance of  @xcite and detections of blas require very high signal - to - noise - ratio ( s / n ) of spectra to resolve broad and weak signals from the continua @xcite . converting measurement of these uv absorbers to census of baryonic matter",
    "also depends on ionization fractions and metallicity of the igm , which in many absorbers are still poorly known .",
    "nevertheless , blas and -absorbers , although partially overlapped with photoionized ly@xmath19 absorbers , are estimated to contribute an additional @xmath22 to the baryon inventory at the current epoch ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations of the intergalactic  and emission / absorption features could provide essential information for establishing the existence of the whim and completing the baryon inventory in the local universe . at temperatures @xmath23 k , hydrogen and helium",
    "are nearly completely ionized @xcite . without metals ,",
    "the thermal gas emits / absorbs photons through bremsstrahlung , which unfortunately is optically thin even at intergalactic scales @xcite . because the k - shell transitions of all elements heavier than lithium and the l - shell transitions of elements heavier than iron lie in x - ray bands @xcite",
    ", metals can greatly increase the emissivity of the gas .",
    "however , because of the density - squared dependence , the whim emission is expected to be weak and difficult to detect .",
    "in fact , the igm emission has been directly observed only from the dense regions like intracluster and intragroup media ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the whim emission signals were also claimed in the angular correlation of the diffuse x - ray background @xcite , but disentangling the real whim signal from the unresolved point sources and local galactic hot diffuse gas has been a major uncertainty ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unlike emission lines , absorption lines measure the column densities and thus directly sample the total mass of the intervening gas along a line of sight .",
    "oxygen is the most abundant metal element . in contrast of  as a minority ionization state ,  is the most abundant ion for a gas at temperatures of @xmath24 k and  takes over when @xmath25 k @xcite .",
    "thus they have advantages over  in estimating the total baryon contained in highly ionized absorbers .  and , whose production ionization potentials are 138.1 ev and 739.3 ev compared to 113.9 ev of , are also hard to produce through photoionization in the igm environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that the  column density is about 10 times higher than  in a shock - heated gas ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) whereas @xmath27 in a photoionized gas @xcite",
    ". therefore observations of the igm  and  absorption lines are crucial , not only for constraining the properties of the whim at high temperature end but also for probing the nature of the commonly observed -absorbers .",
    "unfortunately , most attempts at searching the x - ray whim absorption lines have been frustrated .  and",
    "absorption lines at @xmath28 have been unambiguously detected in many background qsos .",
    "however , all these x - ray absorptions are _ inconsistent _ with an intergalactic origin @xcite , but rather can be attributed to the galactic diffuse hot gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) . perhaps the most compelling intergalactic result is the detection of  absorption at the redshift of the large galaxy structure sculptor wall ( @xmath29 ) along the qso sight line h  2356 - 309 ( @xmath30 ) , albeit of low significance ( @xmath31 ; @xcite ) . however , because of the high number density of galaxies along the sight line , the absorption may sample the halo gas of one or more intervening galaxies with small impact distances ( @xmath32 kpc ; @xcite ) , i.e. , mimicking the  and  absorption lines at @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , it may not be representative of the typical whim .",
    "furthermore , attempts at searching for the similar absorption features at the redshift of another large structure , pisces - cetus along the same sight line , failed @xcite . all other claimed whim  and  absorptions have been highly debated .",
    "for instance , the detected  absorption line at @xmath33 in  spectrum of pks  2155 - 304 @xcite can not be confirmed by the observations @xcite , although at nearby redshift a small galaxy group and the corresponding uv  and ly@xmath19 absorption lines have been identified @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a spectrum with unprecedented s / n during the burst states of mrk  421 and reported two whim detections at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "again , observations with  can not confirm the detections and reported significances have also been questioned @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently found a galaxy filament at @xmath35 , which makes the reported  whim detections along the mrk  421 sight line back to be a subject of discussions .    in this work",
    ", we aim to provide detection limits of current x - ray observatories ,  and , in measuring the whim through x - ray absorption lines , and establish requirements ( e.g. , effective area and spectral resolution ) for next - generation x - ray telescopes .",
    "we begin our investigation by scrutinizing the controversial whim detections along the mrk  421 sight line .",
    "we extensively explore all the available  and  observations , and then run bootstrap simulations to test the reliability of any absorption feature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : obs ] we describes the observations and our data reduction processes , and in section  [ sec : res ] we report the data analysis results and compare them with previous work . in section  [ sec : sim ] , we run bootstrap simulations to explore the detection limits of  and  and to establish requirements of next - generation x - ray telescopes . we summarize our results in section  [ sec : dis ] .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the atomic data from @xcite and solar abundances from @xcite .",
    "we conduct our data analysis within _ xspec _ ( version 12.6 ; @xcite ) , and report the 1@xmath36 confidence range or 3@xmath36 limit for a fitting parameter .",
    "we take the flux normalization of @xmath37 at 0.5 - 2.0 kev .",
    "thus 0.2 mcrab is @xmath38  @xmath39 for a flat spectrum in wavelength space , which corresponds to @xmath40  @xmath39 around the  k@xmath19 ( 21.602  ) at the rest - frame .",
    "we define measurement significance level ( sl ) of an absorption line as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the equivalent width and its @xmath44 uncertainty for an absorption line .",
    "we used all grating observations of mrk  421 observed with both   and  that are available as of 2011 april .",
    "since mrk  421 is a calibration source for both observatories , observations were taken on a nearly regular basis .",
    "the  data were downloaded from the cxo archive web site , which included 26 observations taken with the low energy transmission grating ( letg ; obsids of 1715 , 4148 , 4149 , 5171 , 5318 , 5331 , 5332 , 6925 , 8378 , 8396 , 10664 , 10665 , 10667 , 10668 , 10669 , 10671 , 11605 , 11606 , 11607 , 11966 , 11970 , 11972 , 11974 , 12121 , 12122 , and 13097 ) with total exposure of 752.8 ks .",
    "this dataset does not include observations taken with imaging mode and those with the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) .",
    "a quick estimate indicates that these excluded observations would contribute additional @xmath45 to the total spectral counts , and thus our results will not be noticeably affected with or without them . for each employed observation , we used software package ciao ( version 4.3 ) and followed the standard procedure to re - calibrate , extract spectrum , and calculate the instrumental redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) and ancillary response file ( arf ) . for observations that used the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) as the detector",
    ", we only utilized the first grating orders .",
    "the high resolution camera ( hrc ) does not have spectral resolution itself , and the spectral orders in observations with hrc can not be sorted out .",
    "therefore , for these observations , we calculated the rmfs and arfs up to six grating orders and combined them as one in spectral analysis to account for contributions from different orders ( see descriptions in section  [ sec : res ] ) . to improve spectral s / n , we utilized the user - developed idl tools @xcite to combine the negative and positive spectral orders , coadd spectra of different observations , and calculate the averaged rmf and arf by using the spectral counts around 20   as weights .",
    "the claimed two whim detections were based on a subset of the observations listed above ( @xcite ; e.g. , obsids of 1715 , 4148 , and 4149 ) . to scrutinize the reported whim detections",
    ", we produced three coadded  spectra and the corresponding rmfs and arfs , based upon observations used by nicastro et al .",
    "( spectrum i ) , observations not included in their work ( spectrum ii ) , and all observations together ( spectrum iii ) , respectively . figures  [ fig : chan - ni]-[fig : chan - all ] show six portions of these spectra .",
    "the total 76  observations were downloaded from the  science archive .",
    "we used script package sas ( version 10.0 ) to reprocess these observations . to avoid the severe contamination from the background flares , for each observation we calculated the count rate on the chip ccd9 , and created the good time intervals ( gtis ) by excluding the time periods with rates higher than 0.2 counts per second .",
    "after this filter , there are 54 remaining observations , and each of them has the integrated gtis longer than 5 ks .",
    "we then extracted spectra , calculated rmfs for each of exposures taken with the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) , and combined the spectra of these 54 observations and the corresponding rmfs by running the script _ rgscombine _ to get the final coadded spectrum ( spectrum iv ; figure  [ fig : rgs ] ) , which has a total exposure of 1.2 ms .",
    "we used a binsize of 25  m  to re - bin all the coadded spectra , which is equivalent to an oversample factor of 2 for a @xmath4650  mresolution element of the letg and rgs .",

    "a good continuum model is crucial to absorption - line measurement .",
    "since all coadded  spectra contain the contribution from hrc observations , to account for grating order - overlapping issues ( section  [ sec : obs ] ) , we decide to fit a broad range of the spectra from 7 to 40  , which covers the transitions to be examined . for a ease of comparison of three  spectra",
    ", we jointly fit the spectra i , ii , and iii .",
    "we first use a galactic - absorption modified power - law ( _ wabs*powerlaw _ in xspec ) to fit the continuum emission , with neutral hydrogen column density @xmath67 linked together while the power - law index @xmath68 and normalization are allowed to vary .",
    "we obtain an unacceptable fit with @xmath69 over 3590 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , and we find that some `` broad '' features can not be accounted for by this simple model .",
    "these features are mainly due to imperfect instrumental calibration around node boundaries , ccd chip gaps plus dithering effects , the oxygen absorption edge , and imperfect cross calibration between acis and hrc observations @xcite .",
    "we then use gaussian profiles to compensate the uncounted calibration residuals . to minimize the effect of the known strong ism absorption lines on continuum modeling , we include narrow absorption lines ( with widths @xmath70 ) of , , , , , and  k@xmath19 and  k@xmath66 transitions at their rest - frame wavelengths @xcite in our spectral fitting . the centroid energies and widths of these gaussians",
    "are linked together while the normalizations are allowed to vary in the jointly spectral fitting .",

    "several bad pixels of the rgs accidentally fall around the 21.8   region and cause an instrument feature ( figure  [ fig : rgs ] ) .",
    "although a careful calibration could yield a correct instrumental response of the rgs , in this work we do not use the  spectrum to assess the whim detection at @xmath34 .",
    "visual inspection reveals that none of the above whim lines reported by @xcite is detected in the previously  observations they analyzed ( figure  [ fig : chan - ni ] ) , and in the newly available  observations ( figure  [ fig : chan - new ] ) , and in the  observations ( figure  [ fig : rgs ] )",

    "again , we link the line centroids and widths together in our joint fitting but allow the normalizations to vary among the spectra i , ii , and iii .",
    "the best fit yields a line centroid of 21.90   and @xmath79   for the `` broad '' component and a centroid of 21.87   for the narrow component .",

    "these additional components reduce the @xmath80 of 26.4 by adding nine dof in total . however , applying the best - fit models to individual spectra yields a @xmath80 change of 13.7 , 4.3 , and 10.4 by introducing five additional dof to spectral fitting of spectrum i , ii , and iii , respectively .",
    "all these  spectra can be well described by the same continuum profile with various normalizations , which has been proved to be reasonable to other wavelength ranges ( panels ( a)-(b ) and ( d)-(f ) in figures  [ fig : chan - ni]-[fig : chan - all ] ) . because we find essentially no improvement in fitting the spectrum ii , adding the `` broad '' gaussian profile to the local continuum around 21.9   is statistically unnessary .",
    "we next attempt to measure the equivalent widths ( ew ) of the putative whim absorption lines .",
    "since we have not consistently detected any whim absorption of any transitions reported by @xcite , we focus here on measuring the upper limit to the equivalent width ( ew ) of the  k@xmath19 line , which is expected to be the most abundant transition in a broad temperature range of the whim ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) . at redshifts @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the rest - frame  k@xmath19 at 21.60   is shifted to 21.84 and 22.19  , respectively , and therefore our measurements are obtained from the spectral range described by the continuum colored as blue in panel ( c ) of figures  [ fig : chan - ni]-[fig : rgs ] . to make a fair comparison with the results obtained by @xcite",
    ", we also make similar measurements by using the continuum colored as red .",
    "we should emphasize that the latter measurements are only for comparison purposes , since the additional component to the local continuum that `` amplifies '' the significance of the absorption line at 21.8   is statistically unnecessary .",
    "our results are reported in table  [ tab : results ] .    in summary , our analysis and results do not support the existence of the two whim systems at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we analyze all the available  and  observations of mrk  421 , and have not seen any consistent whim absorption of any transition at either @xmath34 or @xmath35 reported by @xcite .",
    "we measure the ew of the   k@xmath19 absorption line . for the system at @xmath35",
    ", we obtain a firm 3@xmath36 upper limit of @xmath81 m  from the spectrum ( spectrum ii ) extracted from the newly available  observations , in contrast to @xmath82 m   obtained by nicastro et al . for the system at @xmath34 ,",
    "we confirm the existence of a small dip in the spectrum ( spectrum i ) identical to that used by @xcite , but the similar spectral feature is absent in spectrum ii .",
    "the measurement of the line heavily depends on how the local continuum is placed , and the additional spectral component that amplifies its significance is statistically unnecessary .",
    "we obtain an upper limit of @xmath81 m  from the new spectrum , in contrast to @xmath83 m  reported by @xcite .",
    "the findings in this work are consistent with the previous investigation made by @xcite , in which the authors scrutinized the same data set used by nicastro et al .  and a subset of calibration observations of  and .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is no whim line detected at either @xmath34 or @xmath35 along the mrk  421 sight line .    there are also other important absorption lines in the spectral range of interest ( figures  [ fig : chan - ni]-[fig : rgs ] ) .",
    "the prominent lines are , , and  k@xmath19 and  k@xmath66 at @xmath84 , and the  k@xmath19 with rest - frame wavelength 22.0   at @xmath84 is also visible in all four spectra albeit less significant .",
    "again , we only measure the ews of  k@xmath19 and report them in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the  line at @xmath84 can be well explained as absorption from the galactic diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite , and the  line is also believed to originate from the ism @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the ew of  k@xmath19 at @xmath84 measured from  observations is @xmath6 larger ] where @xmath43 is the @xmath44 error of @xmath42 measurement . ]",
    "than that obtained from  observations ( table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "such a discrepancy in  has also been measured by @xcite .",
    "the causes to this discrepancy are still under investigation , and the results will be published elsewhere . in this paper , we mainly focus on x - ray absorption measurements of the whim and will not discuss these non - whim measurements any further .",
    "in sections  [ sec : obs ] and [ sec : res ] , we reprocessed all the available observations and obtained two spectra with the highest s / ns ever collected with  and . despite the increased s / n , we still can not confirm the x - ray whim detections reported by @xcite .",
    "given such a frustrating situation ( see also discussions in section  [ sec : intro ] ) , several crucial questions need to be answered before further major time allocations search for the whim through x - ray absorption line measurement : how high s / ns are needed to firmly establish a whim detection ? what is the  column density range suitable for  and  to explore with reasonably long exposure time ?",
    "is it possible to conduct a systematic study of the whim using the current x - ray telescopes ? if not , what are the requirements for next - generation x - ray telescopes ?      before running bootstrap simulations to address these questions , we first review the whim properties based on the results of numerical simulations .",
    "we then estimate the required instrumental sensitivity to detect the whim by answering the following two specific questions : first , what  column density is needed to probe the majority of the baryons contained in the -bearing whim ?",
    "cosmological simulations predict different  column density distributions per unit redshift with different recipes for galactic feedback and intergalactic photoionization @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : fang ] we convert two recent distributions ( figure  5 in @xcite and figures in @xcite ) to the fraction of baryons contained in the -bearing whim as a function of  column density . in this conversion ,",
    "we assume a single temperature and uniformly distributed metallicity for all absorbers .",
    "however , @xcite find covariance between @xmath8 and metallicity , and the whim is expected to be multiphase . to obtain a more realistic distribution",
    ", one should consider the ionization and metallicity correction together .",
    "however , without a detailed description of the whim properties ( which in fact are our final goals ) , such a correction is difficult to apply . considering the general trend that higher column density absorbers have higher metallicity , the plotted baryon fractions contained in the higher column absorbers ( e.g. , @xmath85 )",
    "should be regarded as upper limits .",
    "furthermore , since there is no clear sign of convergence at low column densities @xcite , in our conversion we use a 4- or 6-degree polynomial to fit the number density distributions , which artificially generate turnover at column densities @xmath86 .",
    "the low column density absorbers could contain even more baryons if the distributions converge at lower columns .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ fig : fang ] gives an estimate of the baryon fraction distribution , which indicates that @xmath4655% ( or 65% or 80% , depending on which simulation is selected ) of baryons are contained in absorbers with @xmath87 and that @xmath4630% ( or 45% or 55% ) of baryons are contained in absorbers with @xmath88 .",
    "another important , yet to be determined property is the dispersion / doppler velocity @xmath89 of the -bearing gas .",
    "this property , although not essential for the detectability of  and ( section  [ sec : sim - chan - xmm ] ) , is important for estimating the required spectral resolution of future x - ray instruments ( section  [ sec : ixo ] ) .",
    "here we use   as a reference . assuming most detected igm  tracing the whim at temperatures @xmath90  k and the total @xmath89 being a combination of thermal and turbulent motions through quadrature @xmath91",
    ", the median @xmath92 of the  absorption lines @xcite suggests a turbulent velocity of @xmath93 for the -bearing gas .",
    "higher temperature gas may have higher turbulent velocity .",
    "thus @xmath89 of the -bearing gas at temperatures @xmath94  k is expected to be @xmath95 .",
    "another useful reference is the hot phase galactic ism traced by the  absorption line at @xmath84 , although the igm environment could be substantially different from the ism .",
    "nevertheless , along the mrk  421 and lmc  x-3 sight lines , the @xmath89 of the  gas can be as large as @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "we therefore will explore three @xmath89 values , 50 , 75 , and 100  @xmath97 , in our simulations .",
    "second , what is the flux limit that x - ray telescopes should reach in order to statistically investigate the whim ?",
    "the answer to this question depends largely on how many whim systems are planned to detect .",
    "clearly when more systems are detected , one can investigate whim properties , like thermal and dynamic properties , metallicities , and their evolution with redshift . to obtain a spectrum with a requested s / n",
    ", the required exposure time is inversely proportional to the flux of a qso . and the higher the redshift of a qso , the higher possibility there is intervening whim absorbers along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , to estimate the number of whim systems that could be detected , one should create a target list by considering the qso redshift and flux as a whole .    in this work , instead of providing a target list for the whim investigation , we require that future x - ray telescopes be able to observe and search for the corresponding absorbers along the majority of the sight lines where",
    "igm absorbers have already been reported ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) . in this",
    "regard , we examine the target lists in @xcite and @xcite and find that there are @xmath98 igm  systems along 28 qso sight lines reported so far . among them , we have assembled the available soft x - ray fluxes to convert the reported flux to the energy range of 0.5 - 2.0 kev ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) . ] for 24 sight lines from the bright source catalogs of _ einstein _",

    "these fluxes range from 0.006 to 46.5 mcrab with a median of @xmath99 mcrab .",
    "fifteen of them have fluxes @xmath16 mcrab and sample a total redshift pathlength of @xmath100 .",
    "for the whim -absorbers with @xmath88 , @xcite predicted the absorber frequency to be @xmath101 , and @xcite predicted the frequency to be @xmath102 considering collisional ionization only and @xmath103 if photoionization is included . for absorbers with @xmath87 , @xmath104 is predicted to be @xmath105 , 12 , and 110 , respectively .",
    "therefore , x - ray telescopes should be able to facilitate absorption line study from background sources with flux of @xmath10 mcrab , and @xmath10610 whim systems with @xmath88 and @xmath10624 systems with @xmath87 are expected in these sources along which the corresponding  absorptions are already known .",
    "we now use bootstrap simulations to examine the detectability of -letg and -rgs . in our simulations , we utilize the user - developed absorption line model _ absline _ @xcite to model  absorbers with column density @xmath8 and dispersion velocity @xmath107 , and use a pl continuum to model an emission spectrum . with the input parameters of @xmath8 , @xmath107 , pl normalization , and an exposure time , we simulate two spectra within xspec , using the rmfs and arfs produced in section  [ sec : obs ] , to mimic  observations and  observations , respectively . from the simulated spectra , we use a gaussian profile to represent the absorption line and measure its ew and uncertainty @xmath43 at the expected wavelength position and then calculate the line sl ( eq .  [ equ : sig ] ) . for a set of parameters , we repeat this procedure 1000 times and record the measurement sl of the line .",
    "we then sort the sl and select the 100th value ( i.e. , 90% simulation trials yield the sl equal to or higher than the selected value ) .",
    "we make the same measurement for various combinations of different exposure times , @xmath107 , and @xmath8 . since the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the lsf of both -letg and -rgs is @xmath4650  m , which is much broader than the expected @xmath89 values of the whim  absorbers ( section  [ sec : exp ] )",
    ", all simulated absorption lines appear unresolved .",
    "what really matters for measurement is the effective ew of an absorption line . to provide a direct comparison to observations , we convert the combination of @xmath8 and @xmath108 to ew through the curve - of - growth ( cog ) , and the combination of exposure time , rmf , and arf to s / n per 50-m  resolution element . for reference , we plot the cog of  k@xmath19 line in figure  [ fig : cog ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cha - xmm ] shows our simulation results . taking the simulations for -letg for an example ,",
    "our results can be interpreted as : from a spectrum with s / n @xmath109 per resolution element , an k@xmath19 absorption line with ew @xmath110 , 5.7 , 8.1 , 10.3  m  can be measured at @xmath111 , 4 , 6 and 8@xmath36 sls , respectively , in 900 out of 1000 observations . in another word , to measure the absorption line with these ews at 2 , 4 , 6 and 8@xmath36 or higher sls , a spectrum with s / n @xmath112 is required .",
    "interestingly , the measured line significances behave nicely like pl functions in the ew - s / n space . for reference , we formulize them as , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , or 8 . for  simulations , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , 0.188439 , @xmath1170.0148031 , and 0.000476159 , and for ,",

    "let us use our simulation results to further examine the two putative whim systems . in figure",
    "[ fig : cha - xmm ] , we also plot the ews reported by @xcite and their 1@xmath36 errors at the corresponding s / n positions of spectrum i. we find that their reported sls appear to be consistent with expectations of our simulations . however , we stress again that their sl measurement could have been largely impacted by the improper continuum placement ( section  [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "our simulations indicate that an  k@xmath19 absorption line with ew=3.0 m   at @xmath34 @xcite should be measured at @xmath121 sl from  spectrum iii with s / n@xmath122 ( eq .  [ equ : sig ] ; figure  [ fig : cha - xmm ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the fact that we only obtain an upper limit ( figure  [ fig : chan - all ] ; table  [ tab : results ] ) . at @xmath35 , an  line with ew @xmath123 m",
    "should be detected at @xmath124 from the coadded  and  spectra , which , again , is in contrast to the fact that we only obtain upper limits .",
    "we therefore conclude that the putative  whim absorptions , if they exist at all , must have lower ews than reported .    is the reported whim absorption at @xmath35 associated with a galaxy filament",
    "? @xcite discovered a filament of late - type galaxies at @xmath35 , suggesting a possible association between the reported whim absorber and the filament . in the spectrum of pks  0405 - 123 observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ , a similar association has also been suggested by a broad   absorption line @xcite .",
    "the authors estimated that the whim contained within the abundant late - type galaxy groups could make up to 15% of the total baryons in the local universe .",
    "however , the non - detection of  at @xmath35 in this work leads us to conclude that there is , if at all , much less   than reported . a recent search in a high - s / n cos spectrum of mrk  421 also failed to find any absorption feature of bla at the redshift @xcite .",
    "similarly , there is no detected hot intragroup -bearing gas in our local group @xcite .",
    "therefore , if there is any gas associated with the galaxy filament at @xmath35 along the mrk  421 sight line , it must be at higher temperatures ( @xmath125 k ) and/or be metal poor and thus contain too little  and  to be detected .",
    "our simulation results also have important implications for using current x - ray observatories to search for the whim absorption .",
    "first ,  and  can probe the whim absorbers with @xmath126 with exposure times of @xmath127 ms from a qso spectrum with a flux of @xmath10 mcrab .",
    "the  column densities correspond to ews of @xmath128 m  ( figure  [ fig : cog ] ) , which require a   ( ) spectrum with s / n @xmath129 to measure it at @xmath130 significance levels ( figure  [ fig : cha - xmm ] ; eq .",

    "this is consistent with the commonly detected absorption lines , which trace the galactic hot ism , in the spectra of local qsos ( @xmath133 ) with fluxes @xmath134 mcrab @xcite .",
    "however , the simulated @xmath135 of  drops by about two orders of magnitude between @xmath88 and @xmath136 @xcite , meaning that such high column -absorbers are extremely rare and may only exist in the circumgalactic environment around galaxy structures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , it is likely infeasible to conduct a systematic study of the whim with  or .",
    "the ew for @xmath137 is @xmath138 m(figure  [ fig : cog ] ) , which requires a spectrum with s / n@xmath139 ( ) and 260 ( ) to measure it at @xmath140 significance level ( figure  [ fig : cha - xmm ] ) .",
    "it would require 61 ms for   and 144 ms for  to collect a spectrum with such a high s / n from a qso with 0.2 mcrab flux .",
    "even for a blazar at its burst state like mrk  421 , it still takes 0.6 ( 1.4 ) ms  ( ) time from the source continuously being bright at 50 mcrab level .",
    "it would take 341 ms for  and 804 ms for  to complete the survey of the 15 background qsos with fluxes @xmath16 mcrab along which igm  has been reported ( section  [ sec : exp ] ) . furthermore , since the expected whim  absorption lines can not be resolved , it is impossible to study the dynamics of the whim with either -letg or -rgs .",
    "clearly , we need new x - ray spectrographs with much improved spectral resolution and much larger collecting area to systematically study the whim .",
    "the goal in this section is to establish the required spectral resolution and effective area for next generation x - ray telescopes .",
    "since there is no existing x - ray telescope with spectral resolution better than those of  and , we use gaussian profiles to simulate the lsfs of the putative x - ray spectrographs .",
    "we assume a spectral resolution , which is defined . ] as @xmath141 , of 1500 , 3000 , 4000 , and 6000 , respectively , with effective area of @xmath142 throughout the whole wavelength coverage .",
    "we use four spectral bins within a fwhm spectral range ( i.e. , an oversample factor of 4 ) in our simulations . with a set of selected @xmath143 , @xmath8 , and @xmath89 of the -bearing gas",
    ", we follow the same procedure as described in section  [ sec : sim - chan - xmm ] to simulate an absorption spectrum of an background source with 0.2 mcrab flux for an assumed exposure time , and then measure the ew and @xmath144ew from the simulated spectrum .",
    "we repeat the procedure 1000 times and select the sl value so that 90% trials have the same or higher sl . in a real observation , background source flux , instrumental effective area , and exposure time can compensate each other , so we define their product ( fae ) as a figure of merit .",

    "c|ccc 1500 & 416.9 ( 808.8 ) & 398.8 ( 794.6 ) & 414.6 ( 799.5 ) + 3000 & 217.4 ( 433.9 ) & 237.6 ( 492.6 ) & 277.8 ( 549.9 ) + 4000 & 171.1 ( 350.3 ) & 212.1 ( 425.7 ) & 241.2 ( 523.0 ) + 6000 & 126.3 ( 276.5 ) & 162.9 ( 368.2 ) & 208.3 ( 461.7 )    our simulations results deserve some explanation .",
    "first , each significance contour has a steep pl plus a relatively flat floor in the logarithm fae-@xmath8 space , which roughly corresponds to the shape of the cog ( figure  [ fig : cog ] ) .",
    "the transition locations indicate the column densities from which the saturation of a line begins to affect the measurement .",
    "second , to constrain @xmath137 at the same significance levels , it takes an increasingly long time with increasing @xmath89 for all resolutions except for @xmath147 ( table  [ tab : ixo ] ) .",
    "this is mainly due to line broadening . with @xmath147 ,",
    "no lines with @xmath148 can be resolved , since the intrinsic line width is narrower than the instrumental lsf .",
    "therefore the simulations are analogous to those for  and , which explains the required exposure times being essentially same for all @xmath89 values . at @xmath149 , a line with @xmath150",
    "becomes resolved .",
    "because the column density @xmath137 lies on the linear part of the cog ( figure  [ fig : cog ] ) , an increased @xmath89 does not increase the ew but broadens the line profile , and therefore requires longer exposure to pick up the absorption signals from the continuum .",
    "a spectrograph with spectral resolution of @xmath149 is required to resolve the expected whim  absorption lines . as we discussed in section",
    "[ sec : exp ] , the lower limit to the dispersion velocity of the whim  absorbers is expected to be @xmath151 , which is equivalent to a fwhm of @xmath152 for a gaussian profile fit .",
    "although we can measure @xmath89 by comparing the different saturation levels of the k@xmath19 and k@xmath66 transitions of  from the `` low '' resolution observations made with  and  ( e.g. , @xcite ) , such technique can not be applied to a column density as low as @xmath153 because saturation is negligible and the k@xmath66 line becomes too weak to be detectable .",
    "therefore , we have to rely on the instrumental resolution ( @xmath154 ) to resolve the line and obtain the dynamical and kinematic information of -absorbers .",
    "please note that , to date , the x - ray spectrograph with the highest spectral resolution is the high energy transmission grating spectrograph ( hetgs ; @xcite ) aboard on , which has two sets of gratings : the high energy grating ( heg ) and medium energy grating ( meg ) with resolutions of @xmath155 and @xmath156 at 20  .",
    "clearly , they are still not high enough for resolving the expected whim absorption line .",
    "furthermore , the small effective area ( @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) around 20   makes the hetgs infeasible for the task discussed here ( please also see below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lsf ] shows the necessity for high spectral resolution by comparing the lsfs of , , and a next - generation x - ray spectrograph with @xmath159 and the corresponding simulated spectra .",
    "it demonstrates that an absorber with two velocity components separated by @xmath160 can not be resolved by ( ) even from a spectrum with s / n as high as 350 ( 200 ) , but it can be clearly resolved by the next - generation spectrograph from a spectrum with s / n @xmath161 .    with @xmath159 , an effective area of @xmath13 is needed for the spectrograph to systematically survey the whim  along 15 sight lines within 6 months .",
    "assuming that all  absorbers have @xmath162 , it would take 11.2 ms for a spectrograph with @xmath159 and @xmath163 to finish surveying those 15 qsos with @xmath16 mcrab ( section  [ sec : exp ] ) and measure the intervening whim absorbers with @xmath153 at @xmath9 significance . assuming a 70% on - target timing efficiency , this is equivalent to a half year . to constrain the absorbers with @xmath164 with the same amount of exposure time ,",
    "@xmath142 is required ( figure  [ fig : ixo ] ) .    in this section , we focused on the instrumental requirement particular for the study of the whim .",
