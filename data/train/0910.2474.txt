    "notice that the @xmath5 & @xmath14 structure above does not need the ternary of cantor as a starting point : if we divide the unit invertal @xmath61 in halfs , in quarters ,  where @xmath62 is the size of each interval - box in @xmath37th step , then we simply replace `` 3 '' by `` 2 '' in the denominators of @xmath5 and @xmath14 above .",

    "we start with nq1000 , and we represent ( ditto for other cases ) the graph of the closing market price @xmath85 as a function of time @xmath86 one day at a time : one day a unit time .",
    "time @xmath86 the horizontal axis , the corresponding price @xmath85 the vertical one .",
    "we take the signal @xmath87 and project these discrete values onto the vertical axis @xmath85 . this set of @xmath88 points is a cantordust contained in a vertical segment @xmath89 .",
    "we cover vertical @xmath89 with adjacent interval - boxes of equal size @xmath1 .",
    "the number @xmath63 of boxes should not exceed , ideally , the square root of the total @xmath90 points in the signal .",
    "each point in vertical @xmath89 is a certain market price : the higher the point in @xmath89 i.e. the higher the box @xmath0 that contains itthe higher the price @xmath85 .",
    "the weight @xmath2 of box @xmath0 is the number of days in which market prices @xmath85 fell between the vertical bounds or extremes of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , each such box represents an increment @xmath91 in prices @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath92 and @xmath93 be the extremes of segment @xmath89 : the lower and upper prices . for nq1000 as well as for the djia s , we always notice a rather small set @xmath94 of very heavy boxes quite near @xmath92 .",
    "these @xmath94 heavy boxes represent many days in which market prices stood firm , with constant values , i.e. prices rather stable , not very expensive .",
    "the short lower subsegment in @xmath89 between @xmath94 and @xmath92 represents prices going down hence its smallness : we will do without it , as generally , prices tend to go up .",
    "hence , we will work with heavy boxes as the lowest @xmath0 boxes , and study the nature of price increase .",
    "the remaining vertical upper segment in @xmath89 , from heaviest boxes at the bottom to the lightest ones on top , will be normalized to be the unit segment @xmath95=i$ ] , the cantordust thus reduced will be _ the _ fractal cantordust @xmath21 . since the signal has a total @xmath4 of 1000 points , then @xmath63 the number of @xmath0 boxesshould not exceed @xmath96 .",
    "the sum of all weights in all boxes is 1000 .",
    "the situation at the top , near @xmath93 , presents a problem : there are boxes with just 1 point , on top of which we find a box with 0 points , then , on top , another box with 1 point  these isolated and extremely light boxescorrespond to prices quite high  and most unstable , for they came to pass during 1 day ( the weight @xmath2 of that @xmath0 box ) only , a situation made worse by the upper _ empty _ box , followed by an even _ higher _ box again with 1 point even higher market price , during one day , with an increase of @xmath97 : skipping the empty box ",
    "these abrupt jumps in prices not only reek of market crash , they pose a geometrical problem , for isolated and far away points do not belong to a fractal  a problem we will deal with below .",
    "the boxes at the bottom of vertical @xmath61 , being the heaviest , correspond to @xmath80 , the highest ones , being the lightest , to @xmath8 .",
    "we have a number of things superimposed , illustrated in diagram d ( fig .",
    "1 ) vertical cantordust @xmath21 in @xmath61 , the sequence of price increases @xmath91 ( one such increase for each box @xmath0 with weight @xmath2 ) , vertical axis @xmath85 with stable price for lower box and higher price for upper one , and the corresponding vertical interval @xmath98 $ ] , with @xmath82 somewhere in the middle .",
    "we will concentrate our study of market crash situation in two separate parts : the analysis of what happens between @xmath80 and @xmath82 , and the study of the descending branch @xmath82 and @xmath8of the spectrum .",
    "the number of adjacent intervals @xmath99 , of equal size , covering vertical interval @xmath98 $ ] should ideallynot exceed the square root of the number @xmath63 of boxes @xmath0 covering @xmath61 . that leaves us with six such intervals @xmath10 , four of which cover the interval @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "the value @xmath82 is calculated in two ways that agree : it is the value of @xmath5 for which @xmath101 in the lagrangian coordinates . on the other hand , going to the spectrum - by - definition , it is in the fourth interval @xmath10 that all values of @xmath5 in that interval cram together around the value for which @xmath101 , as observed in a histogram that contains _ all _ @xmath5sone for each box @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath11 for that particular @xmath10 is no smaller than for any other @xmath10 , also : its @xmath5 values are the only ones quite near one another , crowded around the value of @xmath5 for which @xmath102 . in the symmetric case above we had a decreasing sequence of weights @xmath103  with @xmath68 , each weight corresponded to a certain @xmath10 , each @xmath10 was reduced to a point in that ideal case , with @xmath104 boxes @xmath0 . here we have the lowest @xmath10 , corresponding to @xmath80 , endowed with @xmath105 such boxes with weights @xmath106 and @xmath107 days , respectively , with an average of @xmath108 days , or @xmath109 months . in the same way in which we identify @xmath5 s in a certain @xmath10 @xmath11 the number of such @xmath5swe will average weights @xmath110 s of boxes @xmath0 in that @xmath10 .",
    "we recall that each @xmath0 box pertaining to an interval @xmath10represents a price increase @xmath91 inside pre - determined bounds @xmath111 $ ] given precisely by the extremes of interval @xmath10 .",
    "the second @xmath10 , immediately above the lower @xmath112 , has @xmath113 boxes @xmath0 with weights @xmath114 and @xmath115 days , respectively , with an average of @xmath116 days or approx .",
    "1.5 months .",
    "the third @xmath10 above has an average of 20 days or three weeks , and the fourth one , reaching @xmath82 , an average of 10 days .",
    "so we have a sequence of @xmath117 months , slightly more than @xmath118 months or @xmath119 weeks , @xmath120 weeks or 20 days , 10 days : it does look like @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 slightly larger than @xmath124 indeed , the average of these `` @xmath123 s '' is @xmath125 ; each @xmath126 is taken as the ratio of two consecutive average number of days above .",
    "( in fact , the two remaining @xmath10 s between @xmath82 and @xmath8 do continue with this division by @xmath127 : the average of 5th interval @xmath10 is slightly less than @xmath128 days , and the last one corresponds to the 1 or 2 days per box . )",
    "we can now proceed in _ three different ways _ that indicate an early warning of the market crash situation .",
    "we call it `` early '' because @xmath82 is situated far below @xmath8 , and @xmath8 is at the very top of the market price list : @xmath93 .",
    "so @xmath82 is midway between @xmath92 and @xmath93 , far below @xmath93 .",
    "the logic is that before prices reached @xmath93 values , on their way up , they passed through these critical values corresponding to @xmath82 : hence , what happens at this value is an _ early _ warning of future market collapse .      in sec .",
    "2.1 we defined the instability index @xmath129 we recall that @xmath68 , that @xmath37 was fixed , that @xmath130 , so we can write @xmath131 or @xmath132 ; that for the binomial case @xmath132 is steadily increasing with @xmath38 ( or @xmath5 ) , and that we are between @xmath133 and @xmath82 , which means @xmath83 . in this last ideal case , @xmath132 grows with no change of curvature between @xmath81 and @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "2 , out of scale ) . in the case of our nasdaq signal ,",
    "the weights @xmath134 are @xmath135 and @xmath136 days ( sec . 4 , with a value of @xmath137 until we reach @xmath82 ; the four @xmath11 being @xmath138 , and @xmath139 boxes in the four intervals @xmath10 ( sec .",
    "3 ) between @xmath80 and @xmath82 . the graph @xmath132 , in this case , plotted against four integer values of @xmath38 , shown in fig .",
    "3 ( out of scale ) , has an inflection point , between @xmath80 and @xmath82 , near the latter .",
    "the values @xmath140 , do not imply that the second and fourth @xmath10 have maxima , for in the fourth @xmath10 the @xmath5 s are concentrated around @xmath141 , whereas in the second @xmath10 they are dispersed .",
    "let us interpet @xmath20 .",
    "the first @xmath142 is much smaller than the second one : @xmath143 : the instability increased . in the first instance , prices increased every 3.5 months , a rather stable situation , and they did so for 4 consecutive @xmath91 price increases .",
    "next , the prices began to increase @xmath91 each month and a half , a situation that repeated itself seven times , that is why @xmath20 increased .",
    "the inflection point above is due to an anomaly in the evolution of the market : 5 consecutive price increases @xmath91 each 3 weeks are immediately followed by price increases each 10 days only !  and this abnormal jump takes place 7 consecutive times  the logic underneath is the following : we had a price increase each month and a half , 7 times .",
    "next , we find a @xmath91 increase each 3 weeks , which is a much worse situation .",
    "but , if this situation is repeated a rather - large - than-7 times _ instead of 5 times _ , there is room for the system to adapt , there is valuable time to adjust to the new situation _ before _ time intervals between consecutive @xmath91 shorten again .",
    "this numerical anomaly in the values of @xmath11 causes the inflection point in the graph of @xmath131 .",
    "so , real stability of the system does depend on @xmath20 remaining low , but if it grows , the occurrence of a crash depends on the geometry of its graph ( inflection point ) , as described above .",
    "we continue with nasdaq , we take boxes @xmath0 with weight @xmath2 , divide each @xmath2 by @xmath90 and obtain probabilities @xmath3 .",
    "then we can apply the thermodynamical algorithm and obtain @xmath14 , as shown in fig 4 .",
    "two observations : a ) the curve @xmath144 is _ not _ symmetric as is the binomial one ; b ) there is a noticeable gap between @xmath145 and @xmath141 entirely in the interval @xmath100 $ ] . since @xmath141 means @xmath146 , we observe that the inflection point of @xmath20 , very near @xmath82 , is located precisely in that gap .                if we consider a time span where there is no important crash , e.g. the daily fluctuations of dow jones from 1st jan .",
    "1990 to 1st jan .",
    "1994 , the corresponding curve @xmath144 _ is _ symmetric , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . it should be noticed that symmetric spectra are quite rare .",
    "this case is , as far as we are aware , unique in empirical context the binomial case is a purely mathematical one .",
    "moreover , if we take the data from the djia1600 sample , still the corresponding @xmath144 curve mantains both the gap _ and _ the asymmetry ( fig .",
    "6 ) : enlarging the prior - to - crash sample does not `` dilute '' these crash features . further",
    ", if we do the opposite , that is , take smaller and smaller samples prior to crash : djia900 , 800 , 700 , 600 , always maintaining @xmath147 ( @xmath63 = number of @xmath0 boxes , @xmath4 = size of the sample , all as above ) , we obtain _ the same _ @xmath14 as in fig . 4 with minute variations ( fig .",
    "7 ) : the process is _ strictly _ self similar ( i.e. independent of size sample , or of scale ) around market crash point .        : in order to plot the thermodynamical lagrangian spectra curve @xmath144 in each case throughout this section , we have used only integer values for @xmath148 , since they are enough to determine the key properties of @xmath14 : the graph dots for @xmath149 , would be deceiving , since the corresponding graph points at the extremes of the curve would simply pile up on top of each other , hence the upper gaps would fill up artificially , without adding any real meaning to the geometry of the lagrangian process .",
    "we continue with nasdaq data .",
    "recall that @xmath90 , and that we have between 30 and 40 @xmath5 s , from boxes @xmath0 grouped in 6 intervals @xmath10 , the first four span @xmath100 $ ] , the @xmath5-interval of our study .",
    "we also recall that @xmath13 is the spectrum - by - definition and @xmath14 the lagrangian one .",
    "the first @xmath10 interval , the one corresponding to @xmath80 , has 4 @xmath5 s , more or less distributed evenly in the interval .",
    "the second adjacent @xmath10 ( seven @xmath5 s ) has its @xmath5 s not so dispersed , some are near the @xmath5 for which @xmath150 .",
    "the third @xmath10 has very few and dispersed @xmath5 s .",
    "so @xmath13 and @xmath14 share the same @xmath80 , then @xmath13 grows to a local maximum at an @xmath5 for which @xmath145,",
    " then it goes _ down _ , and it does it in the gap between @xmath145 and @xmath141 .",
    "the fourth interval @xmath10 includes the particular @xmath5 for which @xmath141 .",
    "all its @xmath5 s are clustered around this particular @xmath5 , which implies that a spectrum ( another one ) @xmath151 should have an _ absolute maximum _ at that value of @xmath5 , just as @xmath14 does in the 5th and 6th remaining @xmath10 intervals the number of @xmath5 s steadily decreases , and so does this last @xmath13 .",
    "the picture corresponds to _ two _ @xmath13 : @xmath152 starts in @xmath80 , reaches a maximum @xmath153 for @xmath150 , and descends in the gap between @xmath154 and @xmath102 .",
    "the other , @xmath155 , goes from its own maximum at @xmath156 ( for which @xmath101 ) and decreases as @xmath5 nears @xmath8 ( shared by @xmath155 and @xmath14 ) . by considering a larger sample prior to market crash , djia1600 , we have one more @xmath10 , which clarifies the situation : @xmath155 starts with a _ low _ value in the gap between @xmath153 and @xmath156 ( i.e. @xmath154 and @xmath102 ) , then grows to an absolute maximum at @xmath156 , where @xmath157 , and then decreases as @xmath5 nears @xmath8 : clearly , two different @xmath158 ( with negative second derivative ) , which seem to collide in `` the gap '' ; fig",
    ". 8 shows a schematic diagram representing this situation .",
    "the two @xmath158 multifractal spectra bi - multifractalityare two curves for which @xmath14 acts as an envelope , as a smooth upper `` roof '' of both . according to radon and stoop ( 1996 ) , this situation bi - multifractality with an upper envelopeoccurs when _ two _ different fractal measures are processed with _ one and the same _ multifractal algorithm .     and @xmath159,width=377 ]",
    "as @xmath5 approaches @xmath8 , the market prices increase more and more , to the point in which they can be sustained during one day only . this situation , as we noticed before , is reflected in boxes with 1 or 0 points ( days ) near the @xmath93 top .",
    "we have several such boxes at the top prices , separated from each other by zero point empty boxes .",
    "this situation , which we call `` dispersion '' , depicts a number of isolated points far away from the main body of the fractal cantordust , and , from the point of view of fractal geometry , they should be discarded no isolated point contributes dimensionally : that is why we used several times the expression `` between 30 and 40 boxes '' , for quite some such boxes have to be discarded when doing a spectrum - by - definition @xmath13 . instead , the lagrangian @xmath14 process does not seem to care _ where _ the boxes are : isolated and far away or in the very midst of the cantordust , but _",
    "how many _ they are , for each value of @xmath5 , regardless of their location .",
    "of these two spectra , we choose @xmath14 in order to interpret and quantify the dispersion , since it takes into consideration _ all _ the dispersed boxes near @xmath8 . near crash",
    ", prices jump so high , and so high , that we have many dispersed boxes : @xmath160 is large , and so is @xmath161 , as we observe for nasdaq crash in fig .",
    "4 , where the large dispersion in @xmath8 substantially contributes to the non - symmetry of the curve . carefully notice that , when we enlarge the prior - to - crash sample , e.g. djia 1600 , fig .",
    "6 , we slightly `` dilute '' the crash effect on the descending right branch of the corresponding @xmath14 , for @xmath161 is much smaller and the dots closing the right branch are much more separated than in the nasdaq case , though they are drawn with the same parametric @xmath17 values as for nasdaq .",
    "also , fig .",
    "7 shows that as we take the sample nearer and nearer crashpoint , djia900 , 800 , 700 , 600,  the higher the value of @xmath161 : the highest one corresponds to djia600 ( the numerically smallest sample which still yields a cantordust ) . the economic interpretation : those extraordinarily high jumps in market prices the dispersionincrease as the system destabilizes , as we get dangerously near its collapse . :",

    "when @xmath163 grows ( up to @xmath154 ) then @xmath20 grows , ditto when @xmath164 grows  but , in the middle of these two growing spectra , exactly between @xmath154 and @xmath102 , @xmath20 does not grow  but sits down , hence the inflection .",
