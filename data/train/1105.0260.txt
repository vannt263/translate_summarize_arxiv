    "we orient @xmath2 so that the outer normal vector @xmath6 followed by the orientation of @xmath2 gives the orientation on @xmath7 ( this is different from the orientation convention of @xcite ) .",
    "the theorem states that the index of @xmath0 , with respect to a certain global boundary condition , is given by @xmath8 in this formula , @xmath9 is the local index form  @xcite whose integral would give the index of @xmath0 if @xmath1 were a closed manifold , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the value at @xmath12 of the meromorphic extension of the @xmath13function @xmath14 defined for sufficiently large @xmath15 by summing over the non - zero eigenvalues @xmath16 in the ( discrete and real ) spectrum of @xmath4 .",
    "because of  , the operator @xmath0 extends to an operator ( still denoted by @xmath0 ) on the non - compact manifold obtained from @xmath1 by attaching a product end @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath18 , the @xmath19closure of @xmath0 is known to be fredholm , and its index is again given by formula  . with a proper interpretation of @xmath20 as in (",
    "* section 3 ) , this formula holds even when @xmath21 and the @xmath19closure of @xmath0 fails to be fredholm .",
    "manifolds with product ends are a special case of the end - periodic manifolds that we study in this paper . by an end - periodic manifold",
    "we mean an open riemannian manifold with an end modeled on an infinite cyclic cover @xmath22 of a compact manifold @xmath7 associated with a primitive cohomology class @xmath23 ; the case of several ends can be treated similarly . to be precise ,",
    "such a manifold is of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 are isometric copies of the fundamental segment @xmath26 obtained by cutting @xmath7 open along a oriented connected submanifold @xmath2 poincar dual to @xmath27 , and @xmath1 is a smooth compact manifold with boundary @xmath2 .",
    "end - periodic elliptic operators on end - periodic manifolds were studied by taubes @xcite .",
    "a fundamental example of such an operator would be an operator having the form   on a manifold with product end , and more general versions appear elsewhere in geometry  @xcite , see also the discussion at the end of section [ s : mflds ] .",
    "taubes established conditions under which the @xmath19closure of an end - periodic elliptic operator is fredholm , and calculated the index for the anti - self - dual operator occurring in yang ",
    "mills theory ; this naturally raises the question of evaluating the index in the general case .    in this paper",
    "we present an index theorem for certain end - periodic operators , generalizing the atiyah - patodi - singer index theorem .",
    "assume that @xmath28 is even dimensional , and let @xmath29 be an end - periodic @xmath30graded dirac bundle as in  @xcite with associated chiral dirac operator @xmath31 typical examples would include the spin dirac operator on a spin manifold and the signature operator ; more generally , either of these operators twisted by a complex vector bundle with unitary connection would give a dirac operator to which our theorem would apply .",

    "one can easily see that in this case the operators @xmath47 are invertible on the unit circle if and only if @xmath48 . an application of mellin transform to equation then shows that @xmath49 .",
    "a similar `` spectral '' interpretation of in general end - periodic case will be given in section [ s : end - eta ] .",
    "how restrictive the fredholmness condition in theorem [ t : aps ] is varies from one operator to another .",
    "for instance , the @xmath19closure of the spin dirac operator on a spin manifold @xmath28 of dimension at least 4 is fredholm for a generic end - periodic metric , provided a certain topological obstruction vanishes ; see @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath19closure of the signature operator on @xmath28 is never fredholm .",
    "this explains the need to extend our theorem [ t : aps ] to the situations when the @xmath19closure of @xmath34 is not fredholm .",
    "we will discuss such an extension , for a properly interpreted index analogous to the one treated in  @xcite , in detail in section [ s : non ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the index theorem of atiyah , patodi and singer is just one of multiple index theorems generalizing the original atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite from compact to non - compact manifolds . in many of these generalizations ,",
    "the operator is no longer required to be fredholm but the index is interpreted through some kind of averaging procedure ; examples include atiyah s index theorem for coverings @xcite and roe s index theorem for certain open manifolds @xcite . despite the common use of fourier transform methods , our theorem is of a different nature ; in fact , it is nearest to the classical case in that the operator under consideration is actually fredholm , and its index is given by a formula similar to that of atiyah , patodi and singer @xcite with a different correction term .",
    "our proof of theorem [ t : aps ] is an adaptation to the end - periodic case of melrose s proof of atiyah  patodi  singer theorem @xcite .",
    "let @xmath46 be the full dirac operator on the end - periodic manifold @xmath28 . the operator @xmath50 with @xmath51 has a smoothing kernel @xmath52 .",
    "unlike in the compact case , this does not mean that @xmath50 is trace class because @xmath53 need not be an integrable function of @xmath54 . to rectify this problem , we define in section [ s : b - trace ] a regularized trace @xmath55 , and show that the associated supertrace @xmath56 has the desired properties that @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the closed case , the analysis shows that the supertrace of @xmath59 is constant in @xmath60 , and this fact proves the index theorem . in our case",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ s : periodic ] by reviewing the basics of the theory of end - periodic operators and by deriving an explicit formula for the smoothing kernel of the operator @xmath59 on the periodic manifold @xmath64 .",
    "analytical estimates on the heat kernel , despite being crucial to the proof , are postponed until section [ s : estimates ] for the sake of exposition .",
    "the regularized trace @xmath55 is defined in section [ s : b - trace ] . in section [ s : trace ] we derive the commutator trace formula for @xmath55 ; this is followed by the proof of theorem [ t : aps ] in section [ s : proof ] .",
    "section [ s : end - eta ] discusses a spectral interpretation of the invariant @xmath65 , as well as its interpretation in terms of the von neumann trace .",
    "theorem [ t : aps ] is extended to the non - fredholm case in section  [ s : non ] . the final section [ s : estimates ] deals with the heat kernel estimates .",
    "short time estimates of the sort we need are well known for all manifolds of bounded geometry , of which end - periodic manifolds are a special case , while long - time estimates are more delicate ; to our knowledge , some of the ones we derive are specific to end - periodic manifolds .    * acknowledgments : * we thank lev kapitanski for useful discussions and sharing his expertise .",
    "we thank pierre albin , gilles carron , and rafe mazzeo for illuminating discussions on this material and on their approach to the index theorem in this setting .",
    "we begin by describing manifolds with periodic ends , and the class of operators that we will consider .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the situation with one end ; the extension to several ends is routine .",
    "let @xmath7 be an oriented compact manifold endowed with a primitive cohomology class @xmath66 .",

    "note that @xmath79 where @xmath25 are just copies of @xmath26 . by definition , an _ end - periodic manifold _",
    "with end modeled on the infinite cyclic cover of @xmath7 is a manifold of the form @xmath80 where @xmath1 is a smooth oriented compact manifold with boundary @xmath2 .",
    "there are obvious definitions of riemannian metrics , bundles , and differential operators in this setting ; in short , all data over the end should be pulled back from the same sort of data on @xmath7 .",
    "we will largely follow the notation of  @xcite for index - theoretic notions .",
    "we consider dirac operators @xmath81 defined on sections of a dirac bundle @xmath82 over a manifold @xmath83 .",
    "when the dimension of @xmath83 is even , the dirac bundle @xmath84 is @xmath30graded , and the dirac operator @xmath81 decomposes into the chiral dirac operators , @xmath85    with @xmath86 .",
    "note that part of the data of the dirac bundle is a connection on @xmath82 compatible with clifford multiplication and with the grading .",
    "there are many examples of end - periodic manifolds , and our analysis will apply to the natural geometric operators on these manifolds , such as the spin dirac operator on a spin manifold and the signature operator , as well as to their twisted versions .",
    "we remark that an end may be topologically a product but not geometrically so ; examples of this sort are warped products @xmath87 with metric @xmath88 ( with periodic warping function @xmath89 ) . manifolds with periodic ends that are not topologically products also abound ; for instance the manifold @xmath7 given by ( @xmath90framed for @xmath91 ) surgery on a knot in @xmath92 will have infinite cyclic cover @xmath64 that is not a product if the alexander polynomial of the knot is not monic .",
    "a typical end - periodic manifold with end modeled on this @xmath64 may be obtained by cutting @xmath64 along a lift of a seifert surface for the knot , and filling in this seifert surface by an @xmath93-manifold that it bounds .",
    "we briefly review relevant parts of the fredholm theory of end - periodic operators following taubes  @xcite , starting with the definition of the weighted sobolev spaces .    given @xmath94 and a non - negative integer @xmath95",

    "then as usual , the operator @xmath34 extends to a bounded operator @xmath100 and similarly for @xmath101 .",
    "an excision principle shows that the operator is fredholm if and only if the operator @xmath102 is fredholm ( or equivalently , invertible ) .",
    "taubes gives a fredholmness criterion using the fourier - laplace transform as follows .",
    "given a spinor @xmath103 and a complex number @xmath104 , the _ fourier  laplace transform _ of @xmath105 is defined as @xmath106 for a fixed branch of @xmath107 . since @xmath105 has compact support , the above sum is finite .",
    "one can easily check that @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .",

    "the fourier - laplace transform extends to the weighted sobolev spaces defined above . conjugating the operators @xmath115 by the fourier ",

    "we have delayed a detailed discussion of relevant analytic matters until section [ s : estimates ] .",
