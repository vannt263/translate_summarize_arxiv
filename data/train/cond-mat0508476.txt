    "empirical approaches to earthquake prediction rely on local observations of precursory phenomena in the vicinity of the earthquake to be predicted .",
    "it has been suggested that one or more of the following phenomena may indicate a future earthquake @xcite : 1 ) precursory increase or decrease in seismicity in the vicinity of the origin of a future earthquake rupture , 2 ) precursory fault slip that leads to surface tilt and/or displacements , 3 ) electromagnetic signals , 4 ) chemical emissions , and 5 ) changes in animal behavior .",
    "examples of successful near - term predictions of future earthquakes have been rare .",
    "a notable exception was the prediction of the m@xmath17.3 haicheng earthquake in northeast china that occurred on 4 february 1975 .",
    "this prediction led to the evacuation of the city which undoubtedly saved many lives .",
    "the chinese reported that the successful prediction was based on foreshocks , groundwater anomalies , and animal behavior .",
    "unfortunately , a similar prediction was not made prior to the magnitude m@xmath17.8 tangshan earthquake that occurred on 28 july 1976 @xcite .",
    "official reports placed the death toll in this earthquake at 242,000 , although unofficial reports placed it as high as 655,000 .    in order to thoroughly test for the occurrence of direct precursors the united states geological survey ( usgs ) initiated the parkfield ( california ) earthquake prediction experiment in 1985 @xcite .",
    "earthquakes on this section of the san andreas had occurred in 1857 , 1881 , 1901 , 1922 , 1934 , and 1966 .",
    "it was expected that the next earthquake in this sequence would occur by the early 1990 s , and an extensive range of instrumentation was installed .",
    "the next earthquake in the sequence finally occurred on 28 september 2004 .",
    "no precursory phenomena were observed that were significantly above the background noise level .",
    "although the use of empirical precursors can not be ruled out , the future of those approaches does not appear to be promising at this time .",
    "a variety of studies have utilized variations in seismicity over relatively large distances to forecast future earthquakes .",
    "the distances are large relative to the rupture dimension of the subsequent earthquake .",
    "these approaches are based on the concept that the earth s crust is an activated thermodynamic system @xcite . among",
    "the evidence for this behavior is the continuous level of background seismicity in all seismographic areas .",
    "about a million magnitude two earthquakes occur each year on our planet . in southern california",
    "about a thousand magnitude two earthquakes occur each year . except for the aftershocks of large earthquakes , such as the 1992 m@xmath17.3 landers earthquake , this seismic activity is essentially constant over time .",
    "if the level of background seismicity varied systematically with the occurrence of large earthquakes , earthquake forecasting would be relatively easy .",
    "this , however , is not the case",
    ".    there is increasing evidence that there are systematic precursory variations in some aspects of regional seismicity .",
    "for example , it has been observed that there is a systematic variation in the number of magnitude m@xmath13 and larger earthquakes prior to at least some magnitude m@xmath15 and larger earthquakes , and a systematic variation in the number of magnitude m@xmath15 and larger earthquakes prior to some magnitude m@xmath17 and larger earthquakes .",
    "the spatial regions associated with this phenomena tend to be relatively large , suggesting that an earthquake may resemble a phase change with an increase in the `` correlation length '' prior to an earthquake @xcite .",
    "there have also been reports of anomalous quiescence in the source region prior to a large earthquake , a pattern that is often called a `` mogi donut '' @xcite .",
    "many authors have noted the occurrence of a relatively large number of intermediate - sized earthquakes prior to a great earthquake .",
    "a specific example was the sequence of earthquakes that preceded the 1906 san francisco earthquake @xcite .",
    "this seismic activation has been quantified as a power law increase in seismicity prior to earthquakes @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the success of these studies has depended on knowing the location of the subsequent earthquake .",
    "a series of statistical algorithms to make intermediate term earthquake predictions have been developed by a russian group under the direction of v.  i.  keilis - borok using pattern recognition techniques @xcite .",
    "seismicity in circular regions with diameters of 500   was analyzed .",
    "based primarily on seismic activation , earthquake alarms were issued for one or more regions , with the alarms generally lasting for three years .",
    "alarms have been issued regularly since the mid 1980 s and scored two notable successes : the prediction of the 1988 armenian earthquake and the 1989 loma prieta earthquake .",
    "while a reasonably high success rate has been achieved , there have been some notable misses including the recent m@xmath19.0 sumatra and m@xmath18.1 macquerie island earthquakes .",
    "more recently , this group has used chains of premonitory earthquakes as the basis for issuing alarms @xcite .",
    "this method successfully predicted the m@xmath16.5 , 22 december 2003 san simeon ( california ) earthquake and the m@xmath18.1 , 25 september 2003 tokachi - oki , ( japan ) earthquake with lead times of six and seven months respectively .",
    "however , an alarm issued for southern california , valid during the spring and summer of 2004 , was a false alarm .",
    "earthquakes are caused by displacements on preexisting faults .",
    "most earthquakes occur at or near the boundaries between the near - rigid plates of plate tectonics .",
    "earthquakes in california are associated with the relative motion between the pacific plate and the north american plate .",
    "much of this motion is taken up by displacements on the san andreas fault , but deformation and earthquakes extend from the rocky mountains on the east into the pacific ocean adjacent to california on the west .",
    "clearly this deformation and the associated earthquakes are extremely complex .",
    "it is now generally accepted that earthquakes are examples of deterministic chaos @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite have argued that this chaotic behavior precludes the prediction of earthquakes .",
    "however , weather is also chaotic , but forecasts can be made .",
    "weather forecasts are probabilistic in the sense that weather can not be predicted exactly .",
    "one such example is the track of a hurricane .",
    "probabilistic forecasts of hurricane tracks are routinely made ; sometimes they are extremely accurate while at other times they are not .",
    "another example of weather forecasting is the forecast of el nio events .",
    "forecasting techniques based on pattern recognition and principle components of the sea surface temperature fluctuation time series have been developed that are quite successful in forecasting future el nios , but again they are probabilistic in nature @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued @xcite that chaotic behavior does not preclude the probabilistic forecasting of future earthquakes . over the past five years",
    "our group has developed @xcite a technique for forecasting the locations where earthquakes will occur based on pattern informatics ( pi ) .",
    "this type of approach has close links to principle component analysis , which has been successfully used for the forecasting of el nios .",
    "seismic networks provide the times and locations of earthquakes over a wide range of scales .",
    "one of the most sensitive networks has been deployed over southern california and the resulting catalog is readily available .",
    "our objective has been to analyze the historical seismicity for anomalous behavior that would provide information on the occurrence of future earthquakes .",
    "at this point we are not able to forecast the times of future earthquakes with precision .",
    "however , our approach does appear to select the regions where earthquakes are most likely to occur during a future time window . at the present time , this time window is typically taken to be ten years , although it appears that it is possible to utilize shorter time windows .",
    "our approach divides the seismogenic region to be studied into a grid of square boxes whose size is related to the magnitude of the earthquakes to be forecast .",
    "the rates of seismicity in each box are studied to quantify anomalous behavior .",
    "the basic idea is that any seismicity precursors represent changes , either a local increase or decrease of seismic activity , so our method identifies the locations in which these changes are most significant during a predefined change interval .",
    "the subsequent forecast interval is the decadal time window during which the forecast is valid .",
    "the box size is selected to be consistent with the correlation length associated with accelerated seismic activity @xcite , and the minimum earthquake magnitude considered is the lower limit of sensitivity and completeness of the network in the region under consideration .    the detailed utilization of the pi method that we have used for earthquake forecasting is as follows :    1 .",
    "the region of interest is divided into @xmath2 square boxes with linear dimension @xmath3 .",
    "boxes are identified by a subscript @xmath4 and are centered at @xmath5 . for each box , there is a time series @xmath6 , which is the number of earthquakes per unit time at time @xmath7 larger than the lower cut - off magnitude @xmath8 .",
    "the time series in box @xmath4 is defined between a base time @xmath9 and the present time @xmath7 .",
    "all earthquakes in the region of interest with magnitudes greater than a lower cutoff magnitude @xmath8 are included .",
    "the lower cutoff magnitude @xmath8 is specified in order to ensure completeness of the data through time , from an initial time @xmath10 to a final time @xmath11 .",
    "three time intervals are considered : 1 .   a reference time interval from @xmath9 to @xmath12 .",
    "2 .   a second time interval from @xmath9 to @xmath11 , @xmath13 .",
    "the change interval over which seismic activity changes are determined is then @xmath14 .",
    "the time @xmath9 is chosen to lie between @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "typically we take @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the objective is to quantify anomalous seismic activity in the change interval @xmath12 to @xmath11 relative to the reference interval @xmath9 to @xmath12 .",
    "the forecast time interval @xmath11 to @xmath18 , for which the forecast is valid .",
    "we take the change and forecast intervals to have the same length . for the above example , @xmath19 .",
    "4 .   the seismic intensity in box @xmath4 , @xmath20 , between two times @xmath21 ,",
    "can then be defined as the average number of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than @xmath8 that occur in the box per unit time during the specified time interval @xmath9 to @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , using discrete notation , we can write : @xmath22 where the sum is performed over increments of the time series , say days .",
    "5 .   in order to compare the intensities from different time intervals",
    ", we require that they have the same statistical properties .",
    "we therefore normalize the seismic intensities by subtracting the mean seismic activity of all boxes and dividing by the standard deviation of the seismic activity in all boxes . the statistically normalized seismic intensity of box @xmath4 during the time interval @xmath9 to @xmath7",
    "is then defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mean intensity averaged over all the boxes and @xmath25 is the standard deviation of intensity over all the boxes .",
    "our measure of anomalous seismicity in box @xmath4 is the difference between the two normalized seismic intensities : @xmath26 7 .   to reduce the relative importance of random fluctuations ( noise ) in seismic activity",
    ", we compute the average change in intensity , @xmath27 over all possible pairs of normalized intensity maps having the same change interval : @xmath28 where the sum is performed over increments of the time series , which here are days .",
    "we define the probability of a future earthquake in box @xmath4 , @xmath29 , as the square of the average intensity change : @xmath30 9 .   to identify anomalous regions , we wish to compute the change in the probability @xmath29 relative to the background so that we subtract the mean probability over all boxes .",
    "we denote this change in the probability by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the background probability for a large earthquake .",
    "hotspots are defined to be the regions where @xmath33 is positive . in these regions",
    ", @xmath34 is larger than the average value for all boxes ( the background level ) .",
    "note that since the intensities are squared in defining probabilities the hotspots may be due to either increases of seismic activity during the change time interval ( activation ) or due to decreases ( quiescence ) .",
    "we hypothesize that earthquakes with magnitudes larger than @xmath35 will occur preferentially in hotspots during the forecast time interval @xmath11 to @xmath18 .",
    "the pi method was first applied to seismicity in southern california and adjacent regions ( @xmath36 to @xmath37 n lat , @xmath38 to @xmath39 e long ) .",
    "this region was divided into a grid of 3500 boxes with @xmath40 ( 11  ) .",
    "consistent with the sensitivity of the southern california seismic network , the lower magnitude cutoff was taken to be m@xmath13 .",
    "the initial time was @xmath10=1932 , the change interval was from @xmath12=1990 to @xmath11=2000 , and the forecast interval was from @xmath11=2000 to @xmath18=2010 .",

    "previous tests of earthquake forecasts have emphasized the likelihood test @xcite .",
    "these tests have the significant disadvantage that they are overly sensitive to the least probable events .",
    "for example , consider two forecasts .",
    "the first perfectly forecasts 99 out of 100 events but assigns zero probability to the last event .",
    "the second assigns zero probability to all 100 events . under a likelihood test",
    ", both forecasts will have the same skill score of @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , a naive forecast that assigns uniform probability to all possible sites will always score higher than a forecast that misses only a single event but is otherwise superior .",
    "for this reason , likelihood tests are more subject to unconscious bias .",
    "an extensive review on forecast verification in the atmospheric sciences has been given by @xcite .",
    "the wide variety of approaches that they consider are directly applicable to earthquake forecasts as well .",
    "the earthquake forecasts considered in this paper can be viewed as binary forecasts by considering the events ( earthquakes ) as being forecast either to occur or not to occur in a given box .",
    "we consider that there are four possible outcomes for each box , thus two ways to classify each red , hotspot , box , and two ways to classify each white , non - hotspot , box :    1 .",
    "an event occurs in a hotspot box or within the moore neighborhood of the box ( the moore neighborhood is comprised of the eight boxes surrounding the forecast box ) .",
    "this is a success .",
    "no event occurs in a white non - hotspot box .",
    "this is also a success .",
    "no event occurs in a hotspot box or within the moore neighborhood of the hotspot box .",
    "this is a false alarm .",
    "an event occurs in a white , non - hotspot box .",
    "this is a failure to forecast .",
    "we note that these rules tend to give credit , as successful forecasts , for events that occur very near hotspot boxes .",
    "we have adopted these rules in part because the grid of boxes is positioned arbitrarily on the seismically active region , thus we allow a margin of error of @xmath52 box dimension .",
    "in addition , the events we are forecasting are large enough so that their source dimension approaches , and can even exceed , the box dimension meaning that an event might have its epicenter outside a hotspot box , but the rupture might then propagate into the box .",
    "other similar rules are possible but we have found that all such rules basically lead to similar results .    the standard approach to the evaluation of a binary forecast is the use of a relative operating characteristic ( roc ) diagram @xcite .",
    "standard roc diagrams consider the fraction of failures - to - predict and the fraction of false alarms .",
    "this method evaluates the performance of the forecast method relative to random chance by constructing a plot of the fraction of failures to predict against the fraction of false alarms for an ensemble of forecasts .",
    "@xcite has used a modification of this method to evaluate the success of intermediate term earthquake forecasts .",
    "the binary approach has a long history , over 100 years , in the verification of tornado forecasts @xcite .",
    "these forecasts take the form of a tornado forecast for a specific location and time interval , each forecast having a binary set of possible outcomes . for example , during a given time window of several hours duration , a forecast is issued in which a list of counties is given with a statement that one or more tornadoes will or will not occur .",
    "a @xmath53 _ contingency table _ is then constructed , the top row contains the counties in which tornadoes are forecast to occur and the bottom row contains counties in which tornadoes are forecast to not occur .",
    "similarly , the left column represents counties in which tornadoes were actually observed , and the right column represents counties in which no tornadoes were observed .",
    "with respect to earthquakes , our forecasts take exactly this form .",
    "a time window is proposed during which the forecast of large earthquakes having a magnitude above some minimum threshold is considered valid .",
    "an example might be a forecast of earthquakes larger than @xmath54 during a period of five or ten years duration .",
    "a map of the seismically active region is then completely covered ( `` tiled '' ) with boxes of two types : boxes in which the epicenters of at least one large earthquake are forecast to occur and boxes in which large earthquakes are forecast to not occur .",
    "in other types of forecasts , large earthquakes are given some continuous probability of occurrence from 0% to 100% in each box @xcite .",
    "these forecasts can be converted to the binary type by the application of a _ threshold _ value .",
    "boxes having a probability below the threshold are assigned a forecast rating of _ non - occurrence _ during the time window , while boxes having a probability above the threshold are assigned a forecast rating of _",
    "occurrence_. a high threshold value may lead to many _ failures to predict _ ( events that occur where no event is forecast ) , but few _ false alarms _ ( an event is forecast at a location but no event occurs ) .",
    "the level at which the threshold is set is then a matter of public policy specified by emergency planners , representing a balance between the prevalence of failures to predict and false alarms .",
    "to illustrate this approach to earthquake forecast verification , we have constructed two types of retrospective binary forecasts for california .",
    "the first type of forecast utilizes the pi method described above .",
    "we apply the method to southern california and adjacent regions ( @xmath36 to @xmath55 n lat , @xmath38 to @xmath39 e long ) using a grid of boxes with @xmath56 and a lower magnitude cutoff @xmath57 . for this retrospective forecast",
    "we take the initial time @xmath58 , the change interval @xmath59 to @xmath60 , and the forecast interval @xmath60 to @xmath61 @xcite . in the analysis given above we considered regions with @xmath41 positive to be hotspots .",
    "the pi forecast under the above conditions with @xmath62 is given in figure  [ fig.pixels]b .",
    "hotspots include 127 of the 5040 boxes considered .",
    "this forecast corresponds to that given in figure  [ fig.california ] .",
    "the threshold for hotspot activation can be varied by changing the threshold value for @xmath41 .",
    "a forecast using a higher threshold value is given in figure  [ fig.pixels]a .",
    "hotspots here include only 29 of the 5040 boxes considered .",
    "an alternative approach to earthquake forecasting is to use the rate of occurrence of earthquakes in the past .",
    "we refer to this type of forecast as a _ relative intensity _ ( ri ) forecast .",
    "in such a forecast , the study region is tiled with boxes of size @xmath63 . the number of earthquakes with magnitude @xmath64 in each box down to a depth of 20   is determined over the time period from @xmath58 to @xmath60 . the ri score for each box",
    "is then computed as the total number of earthquakes in the box in the time period divided by the value for the box having the largest value . a threshold value in the interval @xmath65 $ ]",
    "is then selected .",
    "large earthquakes having @xmath66 are then considered possible only in boxes having an ri value larger than the threshold .",
    "the remaining boxes with ri scores smaller than the threshold represent sites at which large earthquakes are forecast to not occur .",
    "the physical justification for this type of forecast is that large earthquakes are considered most likely to occur at sites of high seismic activity .    in order to make a direct comparison of the ri forecast with the pi forecast , we select the threshold for the ri forecast to give the same box coverage given for the pi forecast in figures [ fig.pixels]a and [ fig.pixels]b , _ i.e. _ 29 boxes and 127 boxes respectively . included in all figures",

    "the fundamental question is whether forecasts of the time and location of future earthquakes can be accurately made .",
    "it is accepted that long term hazard maps of the expected rate of occurrence of earthquakes are reasonably accurate .",
    "but is it possible to do better ?",
    "are there precursory phenomena that will allow earthquakes to be forecast ?",
    "it is actually quite surprising that immediate local precursory phenomena are not seen .",
    "prior to a volcanic eruption , increases in regional seismicity and surface movements are generally observed .",
    "for a fault system , the stress gradually increases until it reaches the frictional strength of the fault and a rupture is initiated .",
    "it is certainly reasonable to hypothesize that the stress increase would cause increases in background seismicity and aseismic slip . in order to test this hypothesis",
    "the parkfield earthquake prediction experiment was initiated in 1985 .",

    "no local precursory changes were observed @xcite .    in the absence of local precursory signals ,",
    "the next question is whether broader anomalies develop , and in particular whether there is anomalous seismic activity .",
    "it is this question that is addressed in this paper . using a technique that has been successfully applied to the forecasting of el nio",
    "we have developed a systematic pattern informatics ( pi ) approach to the identification of regions of anomalous seismic activity .",
    "applications of this technique to california , japan , and on a world - wide basis have successfully forecast the location of future earthquakes .",
    "it must be emphasized that this is not an earthquake prediction .",
    "it is a forecast of where future earthquakes are expected to occur during a relatively long time window of ten years .",
    "the objective is to reduce the possible future sites of earthquakes relative to a long term hazard assessment map .",
    "examination of the roc diagrams indicates that the most important and useful of the suite of forecast maps are those with the least number of hotspot boxes , _",
    "i.e. _ , those with small values of the false alarm rate , @xmath77",
    ". a relatively high proportion of these hotspot boxes represent locations of future large earthquakes , however these maps also have a larger number of failures - to - forecast .",
    "exactly which forecast map(s ) to be used will be a decision for policy - makers , who will be called upon to balance the need for few false alarms against the desire for the least number of failures - to - forecast .",
    "finally , we remark that the methods used to produce the forecast maps described here can be extended and improved .",
    "we have found modifications to the procedures described in section 5 that allow the pi map to substantially outperform the ri map as indicated by the respective roc diagrams .",
    "these methods are based on the approach of : 1 ) starting with the ri map , and introducing improvements using the steps described for the pi method ; and 2 ) introducing an additional averaging step .",
