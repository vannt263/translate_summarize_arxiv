    "since the beginning of thermodynamics in the first half of the 19.century its original motivation was the description of steam engines and the liquid to gas transition of water",
    ". here water becomes inhomogeneous and develops a separation of the gas phase from the liquid , i.e. water boils .",
    "a little later statistical mechanics was developed by boltzmann@xcite to explain the microscopic mechanical basis of thermodynamics .",
    "up to now it is generally believed that this is given by the boltzmann - gibbs canonical statistics . as traditional canonical statistics",
    "works only for homogeneous , infinite systems , phase separations remain outside of standard boltzmann - gibbs thermo - statistics , which , consequently , signal phase - transitions of first order by yang - lee singularities .",
    "it is amusing that this fact that is essential for the original purpose of thermodynamics to describe steam engines was never treated completely in the past 150 years .",
    "the system must be somewhat artificially split into ( still macroscopic and homogeneous ) pieces of each individual phase @xcite .",
    "the most interesting configurations of two coexisting phases can not be described by a single canonical ensemble .",
    "important inter - phase fluctuations remain outside , etc .",
    "this is all hidden due to the restriction to homogeneous systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "also the second law can rigorously be formulated only microcanonically : already clausius @xcite distinguished between external and internal entropy generating mechanisms .",
    "the second law is only related to the latter mechanism @xcite , the internal entropy generation .",
    "again , canonical boltzmann - gibbs statistics is insensitive to this important difference .    for this purpose , and also to describe small systems like fragmenting nuclei or non - extensive ones like macroscopic systems at phase - separation , or even very large , self - gravitating , systems",
    ", we need a new and deeper definition of statistical mechanics and as the heart of it : of entropy . for this purpose",
    "it is crucial to avoid the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as the main aspects of this new thermodynamics were published in @xcite i skip here to repeat all the arguments .",
    "instead i will stress here only the fact that negative heat capacity and convex entropy can be seen at proper phase transitions of 1 .",
    "order , i.e. at phase _ separation _ , in small as well in macroscopic systems independently whether they have long or short range interactions .",
    "as there was a hot discussion at this conference about this point , it seems necessary to repeat the arguments here .",
    "the argument is simple c.f.@xcite : at phase separation the weight @xmath1 of the configurations with energy e in the canonical partition sum @xmath2 becomes _ bimodal _ , at the transition temperature it has two peaks , the `` liquid '' and the `` gas '' configurations which are separated in energy by the latent heat .",
    "consequently @xmath0 must be convex ( @xmath3 , like @xmath4 ) and the weight in ( [ canonicweight ] ) has a minimum at @xmath5 between the two pure phases .",
    "of course , the minimum can only be seen in the microcanonical ensemble where the energy is controlled and its fluctuations forbidden .",
    "otherwise , the system would fluctuate between the two pure phases by an , for macroscopic systems even macroscopic , energy @xmath6 of the order of the latent heat in clear contrast to the usual assumption of the fluctuations in the canonical ensemble @xmath7 .",
    "the heat capacity is @xmath8 i.e. _ the convexity of @xmath0 and the negative microcanonical heat capacity are the generic and necessary signals of any phase - separation@xcite_.    this `` convex intruder '' in @xmath0 with the depth @xmath9 has a direct physical significance : its depth is the surface entropy due to constraints by the existence of the inter - phase boundary between the droplets of the condensed phase and the gas phase and the corresponding correlation .",
    "@xmath10 is directly related to the surface tension per surface atom ( with number @xmath11 ) of the droplets .",
    "@xmath12    in my paper together with m.madjet @xcite",
    "we have compared the values of @xmath10 calculated by monte - carlo using a realistic short range interaction with the values of the surface tension of the corresponding macroscopic system . in these calculations",
    "we used the empirical liquid drop parameters for the ground - states energies of the different clusters as given by @xcite .       &",
    "@xmath13&@xmath14&@xmath15&@xmath16 & + & @xmath17$]&@xmath18&@xmath19&@xmath20 & + & @xmath21$]&@xmath22&@xmath23&@xmath24 & + & @xmath25&@xmath26&@xmath27&@xmath28 & + & @xmath29&@xmath30&@xmath31&@xmath32 & + & @xmath11&@xmath33&@xmath34&@xmath35 & + & @xmath36&@xmath37&@xmath38&@xmath39 & +    roughly @xmath40 and one may argue that this will vanish compared to the ordinary leading volume term @xmath41 .",
    "however , this is not so as @xmath42 at energies inside the phase - separation region ( the convex intruder ) is the of @xmath0 ( its slope gives the maxwell construction of the caloric curve @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is a straight line and its curvature @xmath44 .",
    "consequently for large @xmath13 @xmath45 and the depth of the intruder @xmath46 goes to infinity in the thermodynamic limit . of course",
    ", the ubiquitous phenomena of phase separation exist only by this reason .",
    "it determines the ( negative ) heat capacity as in eq.([negheat ] ) .",
