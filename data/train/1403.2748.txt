    "relativistic current - carrying string loops moving axisymmetrically along the symmetry axis of the kerr or schwarzschildde  sitter black holes have been recently studied extensively @xcite ; the current - carrying string loops were first studied in @xcite .",

    "there is an important possible astrophysical relevance of the current - carrying string loops @xcite as they could in a simplified way represent plasma that exhibits associated string - like behavior via dynamics of the magnetic field lines in the plasma @xcite or due to thin isolated flux tubes of magnetized plasma that could be described by an one - dimensional string @xcite .",

    "the astrophysical applications of the current - carrying string loops have been focused on the problem of acceleration of string loops due to the transmutation process when energy of the oscillatory motion of the string is converted to energy of its translational motion @xcite . since the string loops can be accelerated to ultra - relativistic velocities in the deep gravitational potential well of compact objects",
    "@xcite , the string loop transmutation can be well considered as a process of formation of ultra - relativistic jets , along with the standard model based on the blandford - znajek process @xcite and recently introduced `` geodesic collimation '' model @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the cosmic repulsion plays an important role in the acceleration process of the string loops behind the so called static radius of the central object @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate our attention on the inverse situation of small oscillations of string loops in vicinity of stable equilibrium positions in the equatorial plane of black - hole spacetimes that was proposed as a possible model of hf qpos observed in black hole and neutron star binary systems @xcite .    in the  black hole systems observed in both galactic and extragalactic sources , strong gravity effects have a  crucial role in three phenomena related to the  accretion disc that is the  emitting source : the  spectral continuum , spectral profiled lines , and oscillations of the  disc ; clearly , strong gravity has an  important role also in the  binary systems containing neutron ( quark ) stars .",
    "the best signature of the processes occurring in the strong gravity is frequency of observed oscillations because of possibility to obtain very high precision of its measurements @xcite .",

    ". however , in the case of the grs 1915 + 105 source the hf qpo frequency set is more complex - in fact , at least five hf qpos were observed there @xcite .",

    "in fact , the complete observed frequency set can be explained in the framework of the extended resonant orbital model ( @xcite ) based on the so called aschenbach effect ( @xcite ) ; another possibility is related to the multi - resonance orbital model recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there remains a clear problem with explanation of the @xmath0 frequency ratios observed in all three microquasars , gro 1655 - 40 , xte 1550 - 564 , grs 1915 + 105 , if the resonance orbital model with a unique variant of the twin oscillating modes with geodetical frequencies is applied , especially when the limits on the black hole spin given by the spectral continuum fitting ( @xcite ) are taken into account @xcite .",

    "since the  peaks of high frequencies are close to the  orbital frequency of the  marginally stable circular orbit representing the  inner edge of keplerian discs orbiting black holes ( or neutron  stars ) , the  strong gravity effects must be relevant in explaining hf  qpos @xcite .",

    "we have to stress that the region of the innermost oscillations occurring in close vicinity of the horizon in the field of near - extreme black holes with @xmath159 can be excluded from our discussion of the oscillations with the frequency ratio @xmath0 ( or @xmath160 ) , since we can demonstrate that the frequency ratios occurring in those regions are substantially higher ( lower)- see fig .

    "the string loop oscillations could be related to the twin hf qpos observed in microquasars , if we assume their occurrence at resonant radii , where the ratio of the frequencies becomes rational , and a parametric resonance can be relevant . in such a case , we have to consider a dichotomy introduced by the behaviour of the radial profiles of the radial and vertical string loop oscillations , since two resonant points with the same frequency ratio arise for string loop oscillations . in the field of kerr black holes ,",

    "the string - loop resonant oscillations model can thus suffice a satisfactory explanation of the twin hf qpos observed in microquasars , and can give an additional restriction on the black hole parameters .",
    "the radial profile of the radial and vertical string - loop oscillations , demonstrating also the case of a unique observed frequency occurring at the coincidence radius , enables potentially explanation of more complex frequency patterns observed in some microquasars , or even in some binary systems containing a neutron star . the test of applicability of the string - loop resonant oscillations model in the cases when more than two hf qpos are observed , as is the case of the grs 1915 + 105 microquasar , or of some other sources , is of high relevance .",

    "<S> small oscillations of current - carrying string loops around stable equilibrium positions corresponding to minima of the effective potential in the equatorial plane of the kerr black holes are studied using the perturbation method . in the lowest approximation </S>",
    "<S> , two uncoupled harmonic oscillators are obtained that govern the radial and vertical oscillations ; the higher - order terms determine non - linear phenomena and transition to chaotic motion through quasi - periodic stages of the oscillatory motion . </S>",
    "<S> the radial profiles of frequencies of the radial and vertical harmonic oscillations that are relevant also in the quasi - periodic stages of the oscillatory motion are given , and their properties in dependence on the spin of the black holes and the angular momentum and tension of the string loops are determined . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the radial profiles differ substantially from those corresponding to the radial and vertical frequencies of the geodetical epicyclic motion ; however , they have the same mass - scaling and their magnitude is of the same order . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we are able to demonstrate that assuming relevance of resonant phenomena of the radial and vertical string - loop oscillations at their frequency ratio @xmath0 , the oscillatory frequencies of string loops can be well related to the frequencies of the twin high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hf qpos ) observed in the microquasars grs 1915 + 105 , xte 1550 - 564 , gro 1655 - 40 . </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude that oscillating current - carrying string loops have to be considered as one of the possible explanations of the hf qpos occurring in the field of compact objects . </S>"
