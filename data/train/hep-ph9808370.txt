    "over the past few years it has been realized that a new fourth neutrino in addition to the three known neutrinos is highly required in many extensions of the standard model , e.g. see @xcite.neutrinos of new flavour with a mass smaller than @xmath13 can not be a fourth @xmath14 doublet of left - handed neutrino , since they are excluded by invisible width of @xmath4 boson @xcite.they have to be su(2 ) singlet ( sterile ) neutrinos , which do not interact through @xmath15 or @xmath4 bosons of the standard model .",
    "the light sterile neutrino ( @xmath16 ) seems unavoidable to explain significant anomalies which have been observed in experiments on solar neutrinos @xcite -@xcite , atmospheric neutrinos @xcite -@xcite and accelerator neutrinos @xcite.the heavy neutrino ( @xmath17 ) could help to solve the problem of the origin of the excess of baryons over anti - baryons in the universe .",
    "the baryon asymmetry could originate from the lepton asymmetry due to non - pertubative electroweak effects , which were generated in the early universe via cp- and lepton number non - conserving decays of heavy majorana neutrinos @xcite . in the recent publication @xcite a new mechanism of leptogenesis was proposed .",
    "it suggests that asymmetries in lepton numbers were generated due to oscillations of heavy ( @xmath18 ) sterile neutrinos and their interactions with ordinary matter in the early universe.such neutrinos could mix with the standard neutrinos or decay into them.another interesting example is related to the explanation of the karmen anomaly @xcite as the decay signature of the 33.9 mev / c@xmath19 sterile neutrino @xcite.one of the possible mechanisms of the sterile neutrino decays for the case of karmen anomaly could be due to a non - zero transition magnetic moment of the sterile neutrinos .",
    "thus , the search for sterile neutrinos in the mev - gev range through their electromagnetic interactions is rather important and interesting .",
    "+ non - zero electromagnetic properties of the neutrino have been discussed in many extensions of the standard model , for review see e.g. @xcite .  usually large magnetic moment imply large masses .   in the simplest extension , for example",
    ", neutrino masses and corresponding magnetic moments ( acquiring through radiative corrections ) are proportional @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fermi constant , @xmath22 is the neutrino magnetic moment matrix , @xmath23 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix and @xmath24 is the bohr magneton .   the interesting electromagnetic processes with the participation of sterile neutrinos , if they exist , and photons are single or two photon neutrino decays @xmath25 , @xmath26 or neutrino - photon scattering @xmath27 , where @xmath28 stands also for @xmath1 .",
    "note that in general one and two photon neutrino decays are independent .",
    "for instance , in the standard model with massive neutrino for neutrino mass @xmath29 the two photon decay is not gim suppressed and can dominate @xcite.therefore , it would be interesting to obtain direct experimental bounds on the two photon neutrino decay and on the neutrino photon scattering .",
    "the most stringent experimental bounds on magnetic moments of @xmath2 and @xmath8 neutrinos , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the analysis of @xmath32 scattering .",
    "the limits on magnetic moments of @xmath9 are less stringent : @xmath33 @xcite and @xmath34 @xcite from measurements at bebc , @xmath35 from the lep data @xcite and @xmath36(or @xmath37 ) @xmath38 from the recent analysis of single photon production by the l3 collaboration @xcite.the magnetic moment of the sterile neutrino could be constrained from the supernova sn1987a observations .",
    "however , the bounds are model - dependent @xcite and will not be considered further here . in this letter",
    "we apply the primakoff idea to measure the @xmath39 width by measuring the cross section for the scattering process @xmath40 for measurements of radiative neutrino decays .  here",
    "@xmath4 stands for a heavy nucleus.we show that non - zero transition magnetic moment @xmath0 between sterile neutrino @xmath1 and muon neutrino could be effectively searched for via the primakoff effect , in the process of @xmath3 conversion in the external coulomb field of a nucleus with the subsequent decay of @xmath5 .",
    "hereinafter , it is assumed that mixing is small and the flavour eigenstates are defined by their primary mass eigenstates : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "so , that the transition @xmath45 would appear at the experimental level as @xmath3 .",
    "an estimate of the bounds on transition magnetic moments @xmath0 is obtained from the recent results of the nomad neutrino detector at cern @xcite .",
    "note that these bounds would also apply to any other @xmath46 which mixes significantly in @xmath2 or @xmath47 .",
    "from the same analysis , we deduce also a bound on the width of two photon @xmath48 neutrino decay via the use of primakoff reaction @xmath49 .  in both cases a photon from neutrino decay is played by the coulomb field of the nucleus ( see for example fig.1 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the use of the magnetic primakoff effect has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the investigation of the one - photon neutrino decay @xmath50 .",
    "the present work is based mainly on result obtained in ref .",
    "the organisation of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we give the formulae for the primakoff cross sections and the decay widths for the neutrinos with non - zero transition magnetic moments . in section 3",

    "the lagrangian describing the neutrino interaction with electromagnetic field due to non - zero anomalous transition magnetic moment has the form    @xmath54    here for simplicity we consider the case when @xmath28 and @xmath55 are dirac neutrinos with masses @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding modification for the case of majorana neutrinos is straightforward .",
    "the decay width @xmath58 is determined by the formulawe have to replace in eq.(3 ) ( also in table 1 ) @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath0 is the transition magnetic moment between @xmath61 neutrino states.the cross section for the reaction @xmath53 through the primakoff effect has the form @xmath62 @xmath63 here @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the momentum of the incoming neutrino in the laboratory system and @xmath68 is form - factor of the target .  in our estimates we shall use the model of form - factors described in ref .",
    "let us now consider the two - photon neutrino decay @xmath69.one can find that the primakoff cross section for the reaction @xmath70 in the approximation of the equivalent photons for the scattering of neutrino on heavy nuclei is given in the laboratory frame by the formulae :    @xmath71    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the target form - factor , t is the square of the momentum transfer , @xmath74 is the minimal transfer momentum square . @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the cross section for the reaction @xmath77 .",
    "unfortunately eq.(6 ) is not very useful for deriving bounds on neutrino - photon interaction .  to obtain more useful formulae we parametrise the neutrino - photon scattering using the method of the effective lagrangians .",
    "the two - photon neutrino decay width or photon - neutrino scattering is described by d=7 effective lagrangian :    @xmath78\\psi_{i\\nu } +   h.c.]a_{k } , \\ ] ]    @xmath79    @xmath80    where the coefficients @xmath81 , @xmath82 have the dimension @xmath83^{-3}$ ] .",
    "here we again consider the case of the dirac neutrino .",
    "the generalisation to the case of the majorana neutrino is straightforward.the lagrangian ( 8) is the most general d=7 lagrangian describing two - photon neutrino decay .",
    "the d=8 operators are suppressed by additional power of high inverse mass and we shall ignore them .",

    "@xmath94 we have @xmath95",
    "in this section we consider the nomad neutrino detector @xcite as an example in order to estimate bounds on @xmath1 transition magnetic moments and on two photon neutrino decay width .",
    "the nomad detector , designed to search for a neutrino oscillation signal in the cern sps wide - band neutrino beam , is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the neutrino beam with the average muon neutrino momentum @xmath96 is generated by 450 gev protons delivered by the sps to the be neutrino target .",
    "consider the production of sterile neutrino in nomad ( we will follow bellow to similar estimate of the nomad sensitivity for a new light boson search described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the experimental signature for search for the single photon ( see fig.1 ) or two - photon radiative neutrino decay is the single high energy gamma quantum with the average energy @xmath97 in the forward direction that results in a single isolated electromagnetic shower in the detector .",
    "because the cross sections for @xmath98 and @xmath99 are proportional to @xmath100 , preferable search for such events is in the lead of the nomad preshower(prs ) detector@xcite .",
    "the occurrence of @xmath101 or @xmath102 events would appear as an excess of neutrino - like interactions in the prs with pure electromagnetic final states above those expected from monte carlo predictions .",
    "the main contribution to the background is expected from the standard neutrino processes which have a significant electromagnetic component in the final state , e.g. coherent and diffractive @xmath103 production ; @xmath104 interactions , quasi - elastic @xmath8 scattering , etc ..    the results of refs .",
    "@xcite on the nomad search for the hypothetical x - boson , where the similar signature with the single high energy photon in the final state has been used , constrain the cross section @xmath105 to @xmath106    to calculate the primakoff cross section on lead ( eq.(5 ) ) , the model of atomic and nuclei form - factors described in ref .",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "the target form - factor @xmath107 consists of three parts . at small @xmath108 we use the thomas - fermi - moliere model for atomic form - factors @xcite : @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 .  for values",
    "@xmath114 we use the elastic nuclear form - factor @xcite : @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the mass number .",
    "these calculations combined with limit of eq.(18 ) result in bounds to the neutrino transition magnetic moment @xmath0 which are shown in table 1 for different @xmath1 masses . in this estimate , based on mc simulations @xcite , length for neutrino decay was taken to be @xmath118 cm ( thickness of the prs lead , @xcite).in the second column the upper bound on @xmath119 is shown for nomad detector with @xmath120 cm .",
    "the corresponding exclusion region for this case is illustrated also in fig.2.since the length of neutrino decay considered is @xmath121 cm only @xmath122 fraction of neutrino radiative decays is detected . here , the life time of the ultrarelativistic neutrino is determined by the formula @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , the bound of eq.(18 ) turns into the following bound on the product of the cross section and decay width of the sterile neutrino :    @xmath125    consider for illusration numerical example for neutrino mass @xmath126 mev ( first raw in table 1 ) .   for this case taking into account eq.(23 ) results in limit @xmath127 .  indeed , for @xmath128 the sterile neutrino decay length @xmath129 cm , the suppression factor @xmath130 , the cross section is @xmath131 pb and the product of the cross section times suppression factor is @xmath132 pb , which is in agreement with eq.(23 ) .",
    "note that the radiative decay of @xmath133 of a neutrino in the standard model with lepton mixing is enhanced in the coulomb field of a nucleus @xcite . for the case of",
    "sterile neutrino standard gim suppression factor @xmath134 is absent @xcite and the formula ( 6 ) of ref.@xcite for the decay width enhancement factor has the form @xmath135 .",
    "here , @xmath136 is the neutrino decay probability in the coulomb field of a nucleus , @xmath137 is the neutrino decay probability in the vacuum , @xmath138 is the electric field of the nucleus and @xmath139 is an angle between the vector of momentum @xmath140 of the decaying neutrino and the electric field strength @xmath141 .",
    "the typical average coulomb nucleus field is @xmath142 , where @xmath143 .",
    "numerically we find that for pb the enhancement factor is @xmath144 .",
    "for @xmath145 mev , for example , we find that @xmath146 and the neutrino decay length in the coulomb nucleus field is @xmath147 cm .",
    "however , neutrino spends effectively only small fraction of its life time @xmath148 in the region of the coulomb field of the pb nucleus .",
    "this number has to be compared to the fraction of @xmath149 ( see eq.(3 ) and table 1 ) of neutrino decays in the prs detector with decay length @xmath150 cm .",
    "so , the enhancement effect is less than @xmath151 , for higher masses it is even smaller .",
    "this effect is model dependent , it is maximal for electron propagator in the loop , @xcite , anyway enhancement effects in neutrino radiative decays only improve our bounds ( table 1 , column 3 ) .    .",
    "bounds on the value of @xmath119 for different @xmath1 neutrino masses obtained for case of small mixing angles ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) .",
    "see text . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the two photon process @xmath154 we have found that the nuclei form - factor gives the main contribution and @xmath155 .",
    "after numerical calculation we find that @xmath156    using the bound of eq.(18 ) the parameter of the effective lagrangian , eqs.(8,13 ) , can be constrained to @xmath157 for @xmath158 .   from the bounds of eqs .",
    "( 18,25 ) we find that @xmath159    this result in the limit on two - photon neutrino decay time @xmath160    which is valid for the @xmath161 ranges from arbitrary small masses up to the value of @xmath162 , which is defined by @xmath163 suppresion of the primakoff cross section ( 6 ) at corresponding momentum transfer .",
    "it is interesting to compare this limit with the astrophysical bounds on @xmath164 decay lifetime for @xmath165 @xcite : @xmath166 or with the bebc model - independent constraint on limit on @xmath167 decay lifetime @xcite : @xmath168 the limit of eq.(27 ) is much stronger .",
    "for the case of @xmath169 decay we have a bound that is two orders of magnitude weaker , since the fraction of @xmath8 in the sps neutrino beam is @xmath170 .",
    "note that one can derive analogous bounds on two photon neutrino decay width for the case of arbitrary relations between neutrino masses , also it is possible to obtain the corresponding bound on neutrino - photon cross section from the limit of eq.(25 ) .",
    "it is shown that non - zero transition magnetic moment between sterile neutrino and muon neutrino species could be effectively searched for via the primakoff effect , in the process of @xmath3 conversion in the external coulomb field of a nucleus , with the subsequent @xmath5 decay .   from the recent results of the nomad neutrino detector at cern a model - independent constraint of @xmath171",
    "is obtained depending on the value of @xmath1 mass .   for @xmath7 these bounds are comparable with the present experimental ones on @xmath2 and @xmath8 diagonal magnetic moments and are a few orders of magnitude more sensitive than those on @xmath9 magnetic moment obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the same analysis",
    "a constraint on lifetime for two - photon neutrino decay @xmath10 @xmath160 is obtained.the limit is valid for the @xmath161 range from arbitrary small neutrino masses up to @xmath12 .",
    "this limit is much more stringent than the bound on radiative @xmath164 decay lifetime found in ref .",
    "@xcite or the limit on @xmath167 decay lifetime from ref.@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our estimates based on nomad data are rather conservative .",
    "they are obtained for the light target ( nomad preshower ) and for the short neutrino decay length .",
    "however , one can consider sterile neutrino production in the sps neutrino beam dump region ( improvement factor @xmath172 in a probability of @xmath173 conversion ) with the subsequent sterile neutrino decay in the full nomad fiducial volume ( improvement factor @xmath174 in probability of decay ) .",
    "therefore , we believe the limits o eqs.(30,31 ) can be significantly improved by more detailed analysis of the nomad neutrino data , especially for the long - lived ( light ) sterile neutrinos .",
