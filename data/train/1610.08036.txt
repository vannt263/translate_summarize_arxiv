    "cancer treatment methods can be categorized in two ways : noninvasive and invasive .",
    "hifu is a method of treatment that is primarily used for the removal of solid tumors by creating heat .",
    "this method is completely non - invasive . as a radiosurgery procedure",
    "it does not damage tissue , and treatment can be performed in one or more sessions .",
    "this treatment is done in two ways . in the first method",
    ", a probe is inserted through the transrectal area into the desired tissue .",
    "the second method is extracorporeal .",
    "hifu waves are radiated from outside into the tissue of the tumor .",
    "this device follows standards approved by fda and ce which stands for european conformity . today in different countries , hifu centers are being established with this system , which is widely used in the treatment of prostate , brain and breast cancer @xcite . as seen in figure [ fig1 ] , the use of this way compared to general hyperthermia has the advantages that including them can refer to less painful time and high heat in the tumor necrosis @xcite .         + today , this method is used as an extracorporeal treatment for cancers of the liver , pancreas , prostate and bone . as seen in figure 2 , the hifu method ,",
    "when using the extracorporeal method , can be effective in the treatment of cancers of the soft tissue by focusing on sound waves .",
    "hifu ( high intensity focused ultrasound ) has been studied by numerous researchers as a non - invasive treatment for many clinical problems that require surgery .",
    "hifu is a modern medical method that is bloodless , and portable , and it requires no general anesthesia .",
    "this method has limitations , such as the potential to enlarge the size of the lesions created , the need for a cooling system , the inability to treatment by air or bone , problems associated with monitoring of treatment during the healing process , and the inability to plan before treatment @xcite @xcite @xcite . including hifu applications can be referred for the eradication of cancerous tumors in the prostate , uterus , breast , liver and intestines @xcite @xcite .",
    "eradication of a brain tumor is done through the skull as an aid to surgery or minimally invasive surgery usually by means of hifu applications @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite recently , many researchers have shown interesting for new applications of hifu which include cardiac disease such as coronary artery stenosis , cardiomyopathy , hypertrophy and other disorders of the atrial septum , open blood - brain barrier , and fetal tissue @xcite clement mcdonald and his colleagues , by analyzing thermal imaging data based on two magnetic images , predicted the effect of hifu in the treatment of a number of fibroids in different areas that are visible with imaging after treatment @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "a heating biological model is defined by equation [ eq1 ] , through which tissue can be calculated during treatment . in this model",
    ", the geometry of tissue and the heat created by absorption of hifu should be fully studied ; full details of the heat capacity of the tissue should be revealed .",
    "@xmath0 + the flow of heat passing through tissue obtained using the above equation is as follows : @xmath1 in these equations , @xmath2 is heat flow , @xmath3 is weakened heat conduction , @xmath4 is the greatest changes in temperature ; @xmath5 is the length of tissue , and @xmath6 is the tissue level and @xmath7 exposure time . in the case of small lengths ,",
    "the equation wi ll be as follows : @xmath8 heating conductivity inside tissue is obtained through biological heating equation [ eq4 ] . in this equation , @xmath9 is tissue density , @xmath10 is specific heat coefficient , @xmath11 is absorption of hifu energy , qp is the rate of heat flow through the blood , and @xmath12 is indicative of metabolic activity . @xmath13",
    "the best way to investigate heating effects is to calculate the ultrasound absorption rate , blood flow and metabolic activity .",
    "factors such as blood density , specific heat , and temperature of blood affect blood flow . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , a general view of the heating of a capillary network and its parameters is displayed .",
    "the heating energy of a capillary network using equation 5 is obtained .",
    "+ in this regard , @xmath15 is blood flow , @xmath16 is blood density , @xmath17 is specific heat of blood , @xmath18 is specific heat of tissue , @xmath19 is final heat , and @xmath20 is initial heat . by placement of the relationship in equation [ eq4 ] , we will arrive at : + @xmath21 in the above equation , metabolic activity is negligible in front of the heat generated , and we will arrive at : + @xmath22 + according to equation [ eq7 ] , the amount hifu absorbed energy due to the model designed for tissue can be modified . the energy is associated with the similarity of tissue , density , and other biological factors .",
    "usually when treatment is done , treatment points should be shown separately in separate images , and the operator should be specify separately that the same tissue is shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "bright points represent treatment carried out by ultrasound .",
    "as previously noted , the removal of unhealthy tissue by two phenomena of increasing the temperature and the cavitation in tissues is done . in the meantime , in some cases , thermal images are taken that have special importance .",
    "below , thermal images before and after the treatment are shown . at the time of treatment ,",
    "usually images will be thermographic ( figure [ fig6 ] ) so that we can note the difference before and after treatment .          in this model ,",
    "each layer of tissue using three elements of spring , damper and mass , as shown in figure [ fig7 ] , is shown . in order to define the direction of modeling used to measure elasticity , viscosity and mass of tissue of elements , spring and",
    "damper are placed in parallel with each other , and mass is shown in a series with these two in circuit @xcite .                        in this paper ,",
    "a linear method is used for simulation , and the mass , spring and damper model is expressed .",
    "the hifu simulator is used to measure hifu , a phantom , as figure 10 is considered . by putting the values of the mass , spring and damper in the simulation , pressure of hifu on a tissue",
    "can be achieved , including a layer of the kidney .",
    "then , using liver values , the appropriate software estimates for heat and pressure are applied in different layers . in the case of radiation from three directions and heat in the target point to liver tissue on the tumor ( target ) , a temperature as high as 81 c for the modeling will be obtained . in this case , paths of radiations are considered , as shown in figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "liver and kidney comparative graphs of temperature as a result of hifu radiation in the linear part are shown in three layers as table [ table1 ] . between the practical and simulator test , little difference was observed .",
    "+ in this case , in the target point a 76 @xmath23 c temperature , and for the second path a temperature of the first layer of 41 @xmath23 c , and for the second and third paths 30 and 22 @xmath23 c , respectively , are achieved .",
    "this issue proves the effects of viscoelasticity on the temperature and the pressure , and the relative change in the target temperature is 6 @xmath23 c and the first layer is 14% . performing this issue for pressure causes it to create relative changes of 9 percent as a result of changing viscoelasticity of a path .",
    "measurement in this simulation is done by removing a living tissue from the body .",
    "if it is in any path , the value of the physical parameter is measured , and biophysical tissue damage in the same path is prevented as a practical matter .",
    "for this purpose , the volume of contour between the hifu probe to the target in the included k layer and each layer is composed of a voxel matrix , and viscoelastic elements should be extracted in a non - invasive manner ( imaging ) and placed in the designed model , which is a different method . additionally ,",
    "if we want the temperature at the target point to remain at a certain level , mechanical properties can be changed .",
    "heat at a given point or the excitation signal of the hifu probe is modified , and by this action , inverse treatment planning will occcur .        as shown in figure",
    "[ fig12 ] , the percent of relative change of temperature measured in the first , second and third layers for the designed model to practical mode was obtained , and it was at 4 , 5 , and 14 . using the simulator hifu , 6 , 5.7 , and 14.5 percent were obtained .",
    "the values for the liver tissue for the practical mode in the first and third layers , respectively , is 16 , 17 , and 24% , and relative changes using the simulator hifu are 12.9 , 17.9 , and 15 percent .",
    "a comparison chart of liver and kidney tissue pressure , described in figure 13 , is displayed .",
    "the results of this figure in two modes using the software of simulator hifu and model simulation have been carried out , and the following numbers were achieved : 14.59 and 13.39 mpa . in calculating for pressure mode , 9% relative changes are observed .",
    "it should be noted that in pressure mode between the liver and kidneys , no significant changes were observed .",
    "hifu is a method that is used primarily for the removal of solid tumors through the creation of heat .",
    "this method requires the deliberate design of appropriate treatment . in this way , designing the appropriate treatment prevents damage to healthy tissues and results in the best treatment for the patient .",
    "hence , it is very important . in this article",
    ", we sought to investigate pressure changes in kidney and liver tissue by modeling and stimulating hifu processes to determine optimal values , to prevent complications , and to provide the optimal treatment method .",
    "the model and assumption represent a new method in treatment .",
    "planning and precision in this case are also significant factors when comparing the hifu simulator . the advantages of this model can be attributed to proper temperature distribution based on medical need and lack of skin burns caused by sound mechanical effects . additionally using this method",
    "causes set temperature to be employed at specific limits , and as a result , normal tissue is not damaged . +",
    "the presence of blood effects and pulse can be considered as pulse ; in this case , the mechanical elements will be changed with time .",
    "in addition , blood changes the heat distribution in the tissue , to overcome this problem , a correction factor should be considered . in this article , the correction factor of stimulation as an electrical wave in the scale of mv was considered to the input of tissue that in simulink simulation was not isolated from ultrasound stimulation .",
