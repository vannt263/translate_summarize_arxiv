    "kondo effect in quantum dot devices remains a subject of active theoretical and experimental investigations since its first observation @xcite .",
    "the observation of the kondo effect with orbitally degenerate levels provided the demonstration of a strong influence of the orbital structure of the states in the dot and attached leads on the kondo effect @xcite .",
    "further exploration of the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the kondo effect became possible in experiments with double quantum dot systems .",
    "if the two dots are strongly electrostatically coupled @xcite , then there are regions in the charging diagram of the double dot device , where there is no energy cost to transfer an electron between the two dots . in that regions ,",
    "the two ground states of the double dot system with occupations of the two dots @xmath2 and @xmath3 are degenerate .",
    "those ground states span a two - dimensional hilbert space of the representation of the @xmath1 group , hence a spin - like degree of freedom called pseudospin can be assigned to them .",
    "quite analogously to and to a large extent independently of the well - known spin kondo effect , the orbital fluctuations in transport through the double quantum dot result in the development of the orbital , or pseudospin kondo effect . furthermore ,",
    "at special values of kondo couplings , the combined spin and pseudospin kondo hamiltonian possesses a @xmath0 symmetry with respect to rotations in spin - pseudospin space . in that regime ,",
    "the @xmath0 kondo effect with greatly enhanced kondo temperature has been predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "another realization of the @xmath0 kondo effect has been predicted theoretically for a system of a small quantum dot and a large grain .",
    "the signature of the @xmath0 kondo effect in that system is a complete smearing of the coulomb blockade oscillations in the grain @xcite .",
    "recently , spin and orbital @xmath0 kondo effect has been observed experimentally in carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the existence of the pseudospin kondo effect crucially relies on the coupling of each localized orbital state to its own reservoir of delocalized electrons . in the case of the double quantum dot ,",
    "the reservoirs are formed by the electron states in the attached leads .",
    "the separation of the reservoirs allows to define a pseudospin for the electrons in the leads in a natural way . for two",
    "sequentially coupled quantum dots @xcite , or for a double dot in the aharonov - bohm configuration @xcite such a separation is given by geometry .",
    "in contrast , the realistic experimental geometry for two dots coupled _ in parallel _ to the leads does not introduce a separate reservoir for each dot _ a priori _ @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the possibility and properties of spin and pseudospin kondo effect in a double dot embedded in a parallel circuit with the attached leads if there is no separate electron reservoirs for each quantum dot .",
    "the separation between the two electronic reservoirs is characterized by the asymmetry of amplitudes of each electronic mode to tunnel from the reservoir into one or into the other dot .",
    "we introduce a measure of mixing between the two reservoirs , which reflects the structure of tunnel matrix elements . in the limit of completely symmetric tunneling from each mode to both quantum dots , the kondo effect in the orbital sector",
    "is suppressed . at the same time , all modes of both reservoirs couple to a single electron state given by a symmetric combination of the states localized in each dot .",
    "this results in the doubling of the density of states in the reservoir for the spin kondo effect . at the end , the kondo temperatures for the two symmetry points , the @xmath0 one and the @xmath1 one , are equal @xcite .",
    "we find however that the kondo temperature gets slightly suppressed in the intermediate regime between the two symmetry points ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ figtk - b1 ] ) .",
    "the change in symmetry of the kondo effect can be detected experimentally by applying an external zeeman magnetic field . to exclude the effect of magnetic field on the orbital electron motion @xcite , the magnetic field",
    "should be applied in the plane of the double dot device .",
    "an external zeeman field suppresses the kondo effect in the spin sector . therefore , whereas the @xmath1 kondo effect is completely suppressed by the zeemann field , the combined spin - pseudospin @xmath0 kondo effect is only reduced to the @xmath1 kondo effect in the pseudospin sector .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the theoretical model is introduced in section [ sec - model ] . in section",
    "[ sect ] the renormalization group ( poor man scaling ) treatment is introduced .",
    "the results for the kondo temperature as a function of mixing between the reservoirs and of a zeeman magnetic field in the whole range between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 regimes are discussed .",
    "this part is an extension of the previous work of one of the authors @xcite .",

    "our findings are summarized in section [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a device consisting of two single - level quantum dots coupled in parallel to external fermi liquid leads .",
    "the hamiltonian represents a sum of the following terms : the hamiltonian of isolated quantum dots including the interdot interaction , the hamiltonian of fermi liquid reservoirs , and the tunneling between the reservoirs and the dots @xmath4 the hamiltonian of isolated quantum dots reads @xmath5+u_{12}\\hat{n}_1\\hat{n}_2 , \\label{hqd}\\ ] ] where the following notations are introduced : @xmath6  the number of electrons in the dot @xmath7 with spin - projection @xmath8 , @xmath9 is an annihilation operator of an electron in dot @xmath7 with spin projection @xmath8 .",
    "we focus on the @xmath0 kondo regime that is achieved at @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the low energy sector of the model consists of states with a total of one electron in the double dot .",

    "single particle tunneling transforms the low energy states into the empty state @xmath18 ( energy @xmath17 ) or into states with a total of two electrons ( energy @xmath19 ) , which are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the excited states with a total of more than two electrons in the double dot do not couple to the low - energy sector in the second order in tunneling .",
    "they are omitted from consideration .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the annihilation operator of a fermion in the reservoir @xmath25 with the wave vector @xmath26 and @xmath16-projection of spin @xmath27 .",
    "we do not consider the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field throughout this work , then the tunnel matrix elements can be chosen real . to elucidate the appearance of the pseudospin in a general case , when each electronic mode has nonvanishing tunneling amplitudes to both quantum dots ,",

    "in what follows we consider the case of symmetric couplings to both reservoirs , @xmath31 and omit the index of the reservoir by the tunneling angle .",
    "furthermore , we introduce formally bi - spinor notations for the operators in the fermionic reservoir and in the double dot @xmath32 in ( [ psi ] ) the upper signs in the exponent relate to @xmath33 and the lower ones to @xmath34 . using the notations above",

    "one can see from ( [ ht ] ) that for each @xmath26 it is only the mode @xmath37 that couples to the double dot @xcite .",
    "performing the schriefer - wolff transformation for hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) , we derive the effective kondo hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the low - energy sector of the model that can be written as @xmath38 here @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the `` hyperspins '' in the pseudospin - spin @xmath0 space for the double dot and fermionic reservoir respectively , @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the corresponding pauli matrices . for the @xmath0 symmetry point ,",

    "the angle @xmath50 is not dynamical .",
    "yet this angle can fluctuate with wave vector @xmath26 .",
    "the magnitude of those fluctuations determines whether the pseudospin in reservoirs is promoted to a dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "for example , if the reservoirs for two quantum dots are strictly separated , the angle @xmath50 assumes two possible values @xmath17 and @xmath51 , which results in strong fluctuations of @xmath50 with @xmath26 , and eventually leads to the pseudospin kondo effect .",
    "in contrast , if there is only a single common reservoir for both dots , then the tunneling amplitudes to both dots are equal @xmath52 . in that case ,",
    "the angle @xmath50 is frozen at the value @xmath53 for any @xmath26 , and the orbital kondo effect is suppressed .",
    "in what follows we present results on the dependence of kondo temperature on the mixing between the reservoirs @xmath54 obtained by the renormalization group ( or poor man scaling ) treatment of the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) .",
