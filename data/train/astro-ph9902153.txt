    "observed samples of galaxy clusters are notoriously contaminated by projection effects ( frenk et al .",
    "1990 ) even when selected with respect to their x - ray emission ( bartelmann & steinmetz 1996 ; van haarlem , frenk & white 1997 ; cen 1997 ) .",
    "this is particularly annoying because clusters constitute an important class of cosmological objects , and cleanly defined cluster samples could provide a wealth of cosmological information . not only the definition of clusters within samples , but also observable cluster properties like their richness , x - ray luminosity , gas fraction , degree of substructure , velocity dispersion and the mass estimates derived therefrom can substantially be biased by projection effects .",
    "while not solving the principal problem of observing aspherical three - dimensional objects in projection , selection of clusters by mass rather than luminosity might prove a substantial step towards more reliably defined cluster samples .",
    "with the advent of weak - lensing techniques and wide - field surveys , mass - selected cluster samples are beginning to come within reach .",
    "the tidal field of the total gravitating cluster mass determines the amount of distortion observed in images of background galaxies ( kaiser & squires 1993 ) .",
    "a variety of elaborate tools has been developed in the past few years to detect clusters and derive their masses utilising distortions of faint - galaxy samples ( fahlman et al .",
    "1994 ; kaiser 1995 ; kaiser , squires & broadhurst 1995 ; seitz & schneider 1995 ; bartelmann et al .  1996 ;",
    "seitz & schneider 1996 ; squires & kaiser 1996 to name just a few ) .",
    "in particular , weighted second - order measures of the distortion field in apertures like the _ aperture mass _ statistics ( @xmath1-statistics ) provide means to derive the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath2 of a measurement from the data themselves ( schneider 1996 ) .",
    "a possible strategy to use aperture measures like @xmath3 for cluster detection is to move the aperture across a wide data field and monitor @xmath3 and @xmath2 as a function of aperture position .",
    "points or regions of high @xmath2 can then be identified as potential clusters , leading to the definition of mass - selected cluster samples .",
    "this technique led to a cluster detection in the eso imaging survey ( t.  erben , private communication ) .",
    "a further spectacular example of galaxy clusters detected through weak lensing is given by kaiser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    strictly speaking ,",
    "distortions caused by gravitational lensing trace the gravitational tidal field rather than the mass itself .",
    "this is due to the fact that a sheet of constant surface mass density added to any given lens does not change the shapes of distorted images , but only their sizes ( the so - called mass - sheet degeneracy ) .",
    "therefore , cluster detection techniques based on distortion measurements alone select clusters not by mass , but by the amplitude of their tidal field . keeping this in mind",
    ", we will hereafter speak of _ mass - selected _ clusters in that sense .",
    "the question then arises , are the cluster samples so obtained any more reliable than , e.g. , cluster samples selected via abell s criterion or x - ray luminosity ?",
    "more precisely , what fraction of true three - dimensional clusters is detected that way , and what fraction of the mass - selected samples are spurious detections , either not corresponding to real clusters at all or to clusters outside the desired mass range ?",
    "this is the question addressed in this paper using simulated @xmath4-body data , to which we apply for the first time the @xmath3 statistics to construct synthetic cluster samples .",
    "we use high - resolution large - scale structure simulations and first identify three - dimensional clusters in real space .",
    "we then populate the simulation volume with galaxies , fixing the average mass - to - light ratio . in projection",
    ", we apply abell s criterion to construct optically - selected cluster samples for comparison , and the @xmath2-statistics to define mass - selected cluster samples via the gravitational lensing effects of the simulated matter distribution .",
    "the quality of the mass - selected samples is then assessed in comparison to that of the optically - selected samples .",
    "moreover , we derive masses both from galaxy kinematics and weak lensing to compare the reliability of the different mass estimates .    section  2 details the methods used .",
    "section  3 discusses the quality of the cluster samples in terms of completeness and the fraction of spurious detections . in sect .  4 and in the appendix",
    ", we give examples for the line - of - sight structure of some representative mass - selected clusters .",
    "mass estimates are presented and discussed in sect .  5 , and sect .  6",
    "summarises our conclusions .",
    "in order to study the influence of projection effects on cluster surveys selected by optical and gravitational lensing information , we need simulated data allowing to mimic as accurately as possible the selection of clusters and the determination of their properties , for instance their masses . at the same time , the full phase - space information is required to assess the amount of contamination of selected clusters by intervening matter along the line - of - sight ( hereafter _ los _ ) . for this purpose",
    ", we use a large , high - resolution @xmath4-body simulation of a standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) universe .",
    "the simulation was carried out within the gif project ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1998 ) using a parallelised version of the hydra code .",
    "hydra ( couchman , pearce & thomas 1995 ; couchman , thomas & pearce 1996 ) is an adaptive particle - particle particle - mesh ( ap@xmath5 m ) code .",
    "it uses direct force summation in clustered regions , whereas long - range forces and forces within weakly clustered regions are computed on a mesh .",
    "the simulation used here transports @xmath6 particles in a periodic comoving cubic volume of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath9 .",
    "the simulation adopts the approximation to the linear cdm power spectrum ( bond & efstathiou 1984 ) given by @xmath10^{\\nu}]^{2/\\nu}}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 with the shape parameter @xmath12 , @xmath13mpc , @xmath14mpc , @xmath15mpc , and @xmath16 .",
    "the normalisation constant , @xmath17 , is chosen by fixing @xmath18 , the _ rms _ density contrast in spheres of @xmath19mpc radius .",
    "it is determined following the procedure outlined by white , efstathiou & frenk ( 1993 ) to meet the present - day local cluster abundance of @xmath20 for rich galaxy clusters .",
    "the cosmological parameters are @xmath21 ( i.e.  @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "we select a simulation box located at a redshift of @xmath27 to achieve high lensing efficiency on sources at redshifts around unity , where we assume sources to be throughout this paper .    for the analysis of gravitational lensing effects of the simulated matter distribution",
    ", namely the @xmath2- and @xmath0-statistics to be introduced below , the high resolution provided by the gif simulations is essential .",
    "spatial and mass resolution must be distinguished .",
    "the spatial resolution is determined by the comoving force softening length , @xmath28kpc . at one softening length from a particle ,",
    "the softened force is about half its newtonian value .",
    "this limitation is reduced by the high redshift of our simulation box , where the force softening translates to a very small force softening angle , @xmath29 .",
    "the mass resolution , which describes the effect of the finite particle number , is given by the particle mass @xmath30 .",
    "the finite mass resolution introduces a white noise component into the simulations .",
    "this is not negligible for the scdm model because there a higher proportion of the particles is in voids than for models with lower mean density .    since we want to evaluate two different methods for detecting clusters _ in projection _ , we first have to create a sample of _ true _ 3-dimensional ( 3-d ) clusters or groups from the simulation that will serve as a reference set .",
    "we extract clusters and groups from the 3-d dark - matter simulation with a friends - of - friends algorithm ( also called group - finder , cf .",
    "davis et al .  1985 ) .",
    "the friends - of - friends algorithm is based on a percolation analysis : it identifies groups and clusters in the simulation box by linking together all particle pairs separated by less than a fraction @xmath31 of the mean particle separation .",
    "each distinct subset of connected particles is then taken as a group or cluster .",
    "we have chosen @xmath32 , but the result of group finding does not sensitively depend on the exact choice of @xmath31 .    assuming that the clusters and groups found by the group - finder are completely virialised , we compute their virial masses @xmath33 , defined as the mass enclosed by a sphere with a radius @xmath34 which contains a mean overdensity of 200 times the critical mass density , @xmath35 . for an @xmath23 universe ,",
    "this radius approximately separates virialised regions from the infall regions of the haloes ( cole & lacey 1996 ) .",
    "several reference sets of `` true '' 3-d clusters are then formed by selecting objects with @xmath33 above certain mass thresholds .",
    "having dark - matter particles only , we need to populate our simulation with galaxies for optical cluster selection .",
    "we employ the following scheme .",
    "galaxy luminosities @xmath36 are drawn from a schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) , @xmath37 with parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 taken from the cfa redshift survey by marzke , huchra & geller ( 1994 ) . the formal divergence for @xmath40 in the number - density integral of the luminosity function",
    "is avoided by introducing a lower luminosity cut - off @xmath41 . for the normalisation of the luminosity distribution",
    ", we follow the prescription by schechter ( 1976 ) .",
    "we calculate a richness estimate by computing the most probable value of the third - brightest absolute magnitude @xmath42 , and then integrate the luminosity distribution from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "frenk et al .",
    "( 1990 ) showed that this yields the dimension - less normalisation factor @xmath44 .",
    "the normalisation factor determines the amount of luminous galaxies to be introduced into the simulation .",
    "the total mass - to - light ratio of the 3-d clusters turns out to be @xmath45 on average , in qualitative agreement with observations .    assuming that mass follows light in our model universe , galaxies inherit positions and velocities from randomly selected dark - matter particles . in this sense",
    ", our constructed galaxy sample is unbiased both in number density and velocity .    transforming luminosities to apparent magnitudes for higher redshifts",
    ", we account for the @xmath46 correction .",
    "if the spectral energy distribution varies with frequency @xmath47 as a power law with exponent @xmath48 , the additive @xmath46 correction is @xmath49 we choose @xmath50 for the spectral index , which sufficiently well reflects the spectral properties of ordinary galaxies .",
    "volume - limited cluster catalogues are then obtained after projecting particle positions onto planes along the three orthogonal axes of the simulation box .",
    "groups and clusters in projection are identified with a 2-d version of the friends - of - friends algorithm .",
    "we then apply the optical abell criterion ( abell 1958 ) to select galaxy clusters .",
    "this widely used cluster detection and classification scheme does not depend on redshift @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , it can also be employed at the high redshift of the simulation even though it has traditionally been used only for fairly shallow cluster surveys .",
    "briefly , a cluster is classified as an abell cluster if within the abell radius of @xmath52mpc from its centre , and after subtraction of the mean background , the number count of galaxies exceeds a certain value @xmath53 .",
    "counting is restricted to the apparent magnitude interval @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the apparent magnitude of the third - brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "the actual count @xmath53 is used to assign abell richness classes @xmath56 . for @xmath57 ,",
    "a cluster has to contain at least @xmath58 galaxies , while @xmath59 and @xmath60 correspond to @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "we also straightforwardly apply abell s criterion to three - dimensional clusters in order to assess the influence of projection effects on richness - class estimates .    for the background subtraction , we follow frenk et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . in order to estimate the background , i.e.  the contamination by foreground and background galaxies in the simulation box",
    ", we assume that the number of galaxies contributing to the contamination is proportional to the volume projected onto the cluster . in our case",
    ", we expect 8 background galaxies within a cylinder of volume @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , a cluster with richness class @xmath64 has to encompass at least 58 galaxies in the appropriate magnitude interval ; 8 background galaxies in addition to the 50 genuine cluster members .",
    "since observed column densities towards galaxy clusters will be considerably larger than assumed here , and since the conditions in realistic observations are less controlled than here , projection effects could even be larger in reality .",
    "we briefly review in this section relations from gravitational lensing theory important later on . for a derivation cf .",
    "schneider , ehlers & falco ( 1992 ) . some remarks on the numerical calculation of lensing properties will also be made .",

    "the projected particle positions are interpolated on a grid of @xmath76 cells to maintain the high resolution of the @xmath4-body simulation .",
    "the resulting surface mass density is scaled with the critical surface mass density ( [ sig_cr ] ) to find the convergence @xmath65 . for a numerically stable and efficient method to convert @xmath65 to @xmath74",
    ", we use a fast poisson solver ( swarztrauber 1984 ) .",
    "the efficiency of this method rests on the fast fourier transform ( fft ) leading to an asymptotic operation count of @xmath77 .",
    "the algorithm approximates the laplacian on a grid , transforms to fourier space , solves the resulting tri - diagonal system of linear equations , and back - transforms to real space .",
    "in contrast to other approaches , the approximation is made here by discretising the equations , which can then be solved exactly by a subsequent discrete fft .",
    "having determined the deflection potential @xmath72 , the local properties of the lens , such as the surface mass density @xmath65 and the complex shear @xmath78 , can be expressed in terms of second derivatives of @xmath72 , @xmath79 where indices @xmath80 following commas denote partial derivatives with respect to @xmath81 .",
    "galaxy clusters can be selected solely by their mass using the method developed by schneider ( 1996 ) . for detecting dark - matter concentrations through image distortions of faint background galaxies ,",

    "we set the number density of the background sources to @xmath110 .",
    "the complex image ellipticity @xmath101 can then be calculated in terms of the source ellipticity @xmath104 and the reduced shear @xmath111 by the transformation ( schneider & seitz 1995 ) @xmath112    in analogy to the tangential shear component @xmath113 occurring in ( [ mapstat ] ) , a similar quantity for the image ellipticities can be defined .",

    "now , we are led to aperture measures with different merits .",
    "two principal choices for the filter function have been suggested in the literature .",
    "one leads to the @xmath0-statistics proposed by kaiser ( 1995 ) and first applied by fahlman et al .",
    "it gives a lower bound to the average surface mass density @xmath65 within a circle inside an annulus by measuring the distortions of background galaxy images inside the annulus .",
    "the @xmath0-statistics will be used in sect .",
    "[ zeta ] for constraining the masses of clusters detected through their @xmath2-statistics .",
    "the piece - wise constant weight function for the @xmath0-statistics reads ( schneider 1996 ) @xmath126 inserting this weight function into eq .",
    "( [ mapstat ] ) yields @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the distance vector between the point under consideration and @xmath96 , and @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the bounding radii of an annulus around @xmath96 .",
    "it can then be shown that @xmath131 is related to the mean convergence @xmath132 in the annulus by @xmath133 @xmath134 being the mean convergence in the circle with radius @xmath129 around @xmath96 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath0-statistics constrains the average convergence in a circular aperture through the tangential shear in an annulus surrounding the aperture .",
    "since @xmath135 , @xmath131 provides a lower bound to the mean surface mass density enclosed by @xmath129 .    as mentioned before , it is possible to use the image ellipticities @xmath101 of the background galaxies as unbiased estimates of twice the tangential shear , @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , the integral in ( [ eq_zeta ] ) can be approximated as a discrete sum over galaxy images , @xmath137    in this study , we want to obtain a lower bound to the total cluster masses . for a meaningful application of the @xmath0-statistics , it is important to include the complete cluster into the measurement .",
    "this can be achieved following bartelmann ( 1995 ) .",
    "if we apply the @xmath0-statistics to a nested set of annuli with radii @xmath138 , @xmath139 , then the @xmath0-statistics for an annulus with @xmath140 reads @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass @xmath144 in such an annulus is the product of surface mass density times the area , @xmath145 where the area of the annulus is @xmath146 the crucial point is now that the mass contained within a circle of radius @xmath90 is always the sum of the masses contained in annuli with outer radii @xmath147 , irrespective of how the area is decomposed into such rings . keeping this in mind , eqs .",

    "the fact that there is one equation less than the number of unknowns reflects the scaling invariance of the surface mass density @xmath65 . assuming that the outermost annulus does not contain any significant convergence , i.e.  @xmath152",
    ", we finally arrive at the following set of equations for the masses @xmath153 enclosed by radii @xmath154 : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is shorthand for @xmath157    of course , a lower bound to the total cluster mass could also be obtained by placing an annulus around the entire cluster and applying the @xmath0-statistics to that annulus only rather than to a set of nested annuli .",
    "our approach has two advantages ; first , it yields a profile of @xmath65 which allows to assess the location of the outer cluster boundary , for which we found that @xmath158mpc is an appropriate choice .",
    "second , it uses galaxy ellipticity measurements in all annuli rather than the outermost only , thus reducing the noise .",
    "however , the errors in the @xmath153 are correlated at successive radii , making an immediate interpretation of the significance at any given radius less transparent .",
    "since the @xmath0-statistics is not designed for detecting mass concentrations , its filter function is not optimised for achieving high signal - to - noise ratios , leading to high noise levels in a signal - to - noise map .",
    "schneider ( 1996 ) solved this problem by introducing the smooth , continuous weight function @xmath159 in the following , the term @xmath2-statistics refers to the signal - to - noise ratio obtained from eq .",

    "we are now in a position to investigate completeness and homogeneity of cluster catalogues constructed with the @xmath2-statistics as opposed to the optical abell criterion . to this end , we create two different samples of 2-d clusters by applying both methods to simulated data projected along the @xmath167- , @xmath168- , and @xmath51-axes .",
    "we then compare these 2-d clusters with our reference set of 3-d clusters .",

    "this way of addressing projection effects in cluster catalogues differs from previous studies ( e.g.  cen 1997 ; van haarlem et al .",

    "the differences between the two methods show up when detections and spurious detections at mass ranges with a lower mass threshold are considered .",

    "falls to only @xmath179 , which clearly indicates that a large number of suspected spurious detections in reality corresponds to 3-dimensional matter concentrations of lower mass .",
    "if we reduce the @xmath2-threshold for significant detections to e.g.  @xmath180 or even below , the detection rate of 3-d clusters increases , which means that the @xmath2-cluster catalogue becomes more complete . however , the trade - off for the completeness is a higher number of spurious detections , belonging to lower - mass 3-d mass concentrations . for an @xmath2-threshold of @xmath181 , we are able to construct a catalogue containing _ all _ massive abell - like clusters at the expense of also detecting many less massive 3-d objects .",

    "it shows that @xmath2-selected cluster samples contain fewer spurious detections and are generally more complete than abell - selected samples .    a crucial point in the application of the @xmath2-statistics",

    "an example of such a situation is shown in fig .",

    "the contour plot shows a blow - up of the @xmath2-map around two peaks which almost overlap in the lower - resolution @xmath2-map of the whole simulation box ( see the mark in fig .",

    "selection of clusters by mass is possible through their gravitational lensing effects , in particular through the coherent image distortion patterns imposed on faint galaxies in their background .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , image distortions trace the gravitational tidal field of a lens rather than its mass , and it is in that sense that we speak of `` mass - selected '' cluster samples .",
    "the second - order aperture - mass statistics @xmath1 was used which is particularly suitable for detecting dark - matter haloes .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath2 , of @xmath3 provides a straightforward detection criterion .",
    "we also compared the performance of cluster mass estimators based on cluster - galaxy kinematics and gravitational lensing .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows .    1 .",
    "as already found in previous studies , abell clusters are severely affected by projection effects .",
    "this not only concerns the selection of abell clusters , but also mass estimates based on galaxy kinematics and the virial theorem , indicating that the velocity dispersion is also hampered by projection effects .",
    "a second reason for the failure is the fact that the assumption of dynamical equilibrium is not justified in at least some of the clusters .",
    "the projection effects are worse for clusters and groups of lower richness class .",
    "clusters detected with a high significance @xmath2 of @xmath3 are less affected by projection effects than typical abell - selected clusters . like abell cluster samples ,",
    "the mass - selected cluster samples are generally incomplete : samples of clusters detected above a certain @xmath2 threshold typically do not encompass all three - dimensional clusters present in the simulation ; some clusters have lower @xmath2 .",
    "however , the completeness of the samples can be increased by lowering the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "we therefore investigated the effect of varying the @xmath2 threshold on the samples .",
    "completeness of @xmath243 can be achieved for massive three - dimensional cluster samples ( @xmath244 ) by varying @xmath245 .",
    "then , the samples also contain a substantial fraction of spurious detections , most of which correspond to real clusters with smaller masses .",
    "generally , there is a trade - off between completeness and the contamination by spurious detections .",
    "more complete cluster samples are more heavily contaminated by spurious clusters , and the balance can be adapted choosing the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "it should be noted that the exact thresholds on @xmath2 depend somewhat on the choice of the weight function entering the definition of @xmath2 ( cf .  the discussion in sect .  2 ) .",
    "while qualitatively the same trend is also observed in abell - selected cluster samples , the @xmath2-statistics generally performs significantly better than abell s criterion : higher completeness can typically be achieved with a lower fraction of spurious detections .",
    "for instance , cluster samples detected at @xmath175 contain all of the most massive clusters in the simulation and 65% spurious detections , while abell samples with richness @xmath174 encompass only about two - thirds of the most massive clusters and 82% spurious detections .",
    "4 .   lensing - based mass estimates are significantly more accurate than mass estimates based on cluster - galaxy kinematics and the virial theorem .",
    "virial masses are typically biased high because line - of - sight velocity distributions are broadened by projection effects .",
    "lensing also adds up mass in front of and behind the clusters , but the bias is less severe .",
    "the standard deviation from the true ( three - dimensional ) mass of the lensing mass estimate is smaller by a factor of three or more than that of the virial mass estimates .",
    "it should , however , be noticed that the accuracy of lensing - based mass estimates depends on the depth of the background - galaxy sample and other observational effects . while the mass estimates based on the @xmath0 statistics are accurate to within @xmath246 in our simulations , they may well be less accurate under realistic observational conditions .",
    "our study underestimates projection effects because of the limited size of the simulation volume .",
    "this affects both the optical and the lensing - based cluster selection .",
    "yet it appears that selection of clusters by mass yields more reliable cluster samples than optical cluster selection , and , more importantly , the quality of the samples can be controlled by an objective criterion , namely the signal - to - noise threshold imposed .",
    "selection of clusters by their gravitational - lensing effects is comparable to selection by their x - ray luminosity .",
    "in essence , both methods measure weighted projections of the newtonian cluster potential along the line - of - sight .",
    "however , lensing - based cluster detections only require sufficiently deep imaging of wide fields in optical or near - infrared wave bands , and detection algorithms can then be applied in a straightforward manner . in particular , lensing can detect clusters out to significantly higher redshifts than x - ray surveys .",
    "what is more , lensing - based mass estimates do not rely on any assumptions on the composition and physical state of the cluster matter , in contrast to x - ray mass estimates .",
    "it can therefore be expected that reliable , mass - selected cluster samples at moderate to high redshifts can be constructed in the near future from upcoming deep , wide - field surveys with a straightforward , well - controlled algorithm , and that the accuracy of cluster mass estimates will generally be substantially improved .",
    "lensing - based cluster detection algorithms like that based on the @xmath2-statistics can be utilised for cosmology without reference to actual 3-d clusters .",
    "instead , one could define a `` cluster '' operationally as something visible as a sufficiently high peak in an @xmath2 map , and then compare model predictions with observations ( cf .",
    "kruse & schneider 1999 ) .",
    "if , however , emphasis is laid on clusters as individual entities , it needs to be clarified how well different selection criteria fare in detecting true clusters .",
    "our study has shown that selection of clusters by means of gravitational lensing techniques can be adapted such that the resulting samples are superior to abell - selected samples in terms of completeness , spurious detections , and the quality of mass estimates .",

    "figure  [ cluster_14x ] shows a cluster with @xmath208 .",
    "it is apparently only mildly contaminated by a clump @xmath210mpc from the main clump , which is a high - mass object with @xmath262 .",
    "the projected velocity dispersion is almost unaffected ( @xmath263 compared to @xmath264 ) , and shows a bimodal feature , which is also reflected by the curtosis of the projected cluster , @xmath265 , while the velocity distribution of the 3-d cluster has a negative curtosis of @xmath266 .",
    "similarly , the skewness changes from @xmath267 to @xmath268 .",
    "the cluster is detected as a 2-d abell cluster with richness class @xmath59 , while the richness class of the 3-d cluster is @xmath269 .",
    "therefore , the richness class is inflated due to projection . even though this cluster shows some projection effects ,",
    "the corresponding 3-d cluster is massive and therefore clusters like that should be included in a mass - limited sample .",
    "the last example for this class is shown in fig .",
    "[ cluster_6z ] . here , the @xmath2-map has a peak with @xmath270 .",
    "the position histogram shows a very broad peak with a secondary maximum on top of the main peak .",
    "the corresponding 3-d cluster has a high mass , @xmath195 .",
    "the projected velocity distribution is only moderately skewed with @xmath271 compared to the skewness of the main cluster alone , @xmath272 . however , the curtosis of the projected peak , @xmath273 , even changes sign when compared to the 3-d cluster , @xmath274 .",
    "this cluster satisfies abell s criterion in projection , but the main peak has a lower richness class , @xmath57 .       structure of moderately large 3-d group with @xmath2 between 3 and 4 .",
    "the 3-d object is contaminated by projection along the line - of - sight , leading to an increased @xmath2 of @xmath275 .",
    "see the caption of fig .",
    "[ cluster_8x ] for a description of the panels . ]    another example for a low-@xmath2 cluster detected at @xmath276 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ cluster_12z ] .",
    "this detection also corresponds to a 3-d cluster with @xmath277 .",
    "again , the velocity distribution of this cluster is largely altered by the considerable amount of intervening matter .",
    "the velocity dispersion itself is inflated from @xmath278 to @xmath279 .",
    "this is reflected by the curtosis , which changes from @xmath280 to @xmath281 , while the skewness changes from @xmath282 to @xmath283 .",
    "both low-@xmath2 examples are neither 2-d abell clusters nor do they pass the selection criteria for abell clusters in 3-d .",
    "structure of a spuriously detected object which does not correspond to a 3-d cluster .",
    "the high contamination along the line - of - sight leads to @xmath284 .",

    "this material is responsible for the signal in the @xmath2 map .",
    "the velocity distribution is characterised by three peaks with dispersion @xmath287 , skewness @xmath288 , and curtosis @xmath289 .",
    "obviously , the contamination along the line - of - sight is large enough to lead to the detection of an abell cluster with richness class @xmath57 .",

    "<S> choosing the signal - to - noise threshold appropriately , the completeness can be increased up to 100% , and the fraction of spurious detections can significantly be reduced compared to abell - selected cluster samples .    </S>",
