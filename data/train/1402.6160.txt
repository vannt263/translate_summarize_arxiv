    "one extends the definition ( [ poscor ] ) from vectors to processes by saying that a process is `` positively correlated '' if all its finite - dimensional marginals are `` positively correlated . ''",
    "eisenbaum and kaspi s characterization stems from the desire to understand which were the gaussian processes involved in dynkin s isomorphism theorem  @xcite .",

    "this identity in law immediately raises two questions : which are the centered gaussian processes with a covariance equal to a green function ? which are the centered gaussian processes @xmath28 such that the law of @xmath29 under @xmath30 $ ] is a positive measure ?",
    "an answer to the first question has been given in @xcite ( completed then in @xcite ; see ( [ bibi ] ) below ) under the following form . given a centered gaussian process @xmath18 with a continuous positive definite covariance @xmath31 , _",

    "we extend our characterization of `` positively correlated '' squared gaussian vectors to permanental vectors .",
    "this extension is legitimated by the fact that a connection , similar to dynkin isomorphism theorem , has been established in  @xcite , between permanental processes and local times of not necessarily symmetric markov processes .    in section [ iii ]",
