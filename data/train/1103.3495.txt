    "the presence of hard multiple parton interactions in high - energy hadron - hadron collisions has been convincingly demonstrated by the afs  @xcite , ua2  @xcite , cdf  @xcite , and d0  @xcite collaborations , using events with the four - jets and @xmath0-jets final states , thus , providing new and complementary information on the proton structure .    in general , four high-@xmath1 jets ( or @xmath0-jets )",
    "may be produced either in the collision of one pair of partons in @xmath2 hard subprocess or via the simultaneous interaction of two parton pairs , that is in two @xmath3 subprocesses . in the last case in each dijet ( or @xmath4 jet )",
    "system the transverse momenta of two high-@xmath1 jets more or less balance each other .",
    "the possibility of observing two separate hard collisions was proposed long ago .",
    "their theoretical investigation has a long history and goes back to the early days of the parton model  @xcite with subsequent extension to perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the phenomenology of multiple parton interactions relies on the models that are physically intuitive but involve significant simplifying assumptions .",
    "therefore , it is extremely important to combine theoretical efforts in order to achieve a better description of multiple interactions , in particular , double scattering , which will be the dominant multiple scattering mode at the lhc . in this letter we consider some steps towards this purpose .",
    "the cross section formulae currently used to calculate double scattering processes are revised in terms of the modified collinear two - parton distributions extracted from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "let us recall , that with only the assumption of factorization of the two hard parton processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the inclusive cross section of a double parton scattering process in a hadron collision is written in the following form@xmath7 where @xmath8 is the usual impact parameter , that is the distance between centres of incoming ( the beam and the target ) hadrons in transverse plane .",
    "@xmath9 are the double parton distribution functions , depending on the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath10 and @xmath11 and on the transverse position @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the two parton undergoing the hard processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the scales @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the parton - level subprocess cross sections .",
    "the factor @xmath18 is a consequence of the symmetry of the expression for interchanging parton species @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 if @xmath22 and @xmath23 otherwise .",
    "the double parton distribution functions @xmath24 are the main reason of interest in multiple parton interactions .",
    "these distributions contain in fact all the information of probing the hadron in two different points simultaneously , through the hard processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is typically taken that the double parton distribution functions may be decomposed in terms of longitudinal and transverse components as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is supposed to be an universal function for all kind of partons with the fixed normalization , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the overlap function .",
    "if one makes the further assumptions that the longitudinal components @xmath29 reduce to the product of two independent one parton distributions , @xmath30 the cross section of double parton scattering can be expressed in the simple form @xmath31^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this representation and at the factorization of longitudinal and transverse components , the inclusive cross section of single hard scattering is written as @xmath32    these simplifying assumptions , even though rather common in the literature and quite convenient from a computational point of view , are not enough justified and should be revised  @xcite , while the starting cross section formula  ( [ hardab ] ) was found ( derived ) in the momentum representation using light - cone variables in a number of works ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) at the same approximations as in processes with a single hard scattering .",
    "all the previous formulae were written in the mixed ( momentum and coordinate ) representation . recall that in general for the case of the multiple parton interactions we have to use the _ generalized _ parton distribution functions ( gpdf ) .",
    "in other words in the feynman diagram ( ladder ) which describes the gpdf the parton momenta @xmath33 ( in the left part of diagram corresponding to the amplitude @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 ( in the right part of the diagram corresonding to amplitude @xmath5 ) may be different .",
    "let us denote @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the momentum transfered through the whole ladder .",
    "since the ladders in figs .  1 and 2 form a loop we will call @xmath38  the loop momentum . in the previous formulae instead of transverse momentum @xmath39 we had used",
    "the conjugated coordinate @xmath8   corresponding to @xmath40 . ] .    for our further goal",
    "the momentum representation is more convenient : @xmath41 the hard subprocesses * a * and * b * are originated by two different branches of the parton cascade .",
    "note that only the sum of the parton momenta ( in both branches ) is conserved , while in each individual branch there may be some difference , @xmath38 , of transverse ( parton ) momenta in the initial state wave function and the conjugated wave function .     and",
    "@xmath6 are the hard parton subprocesses .",
    "@xmath38 is the momemtum transfered through the ladders @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "[ fig : fig1],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the main problem is in the correct calculation of these two - parton functions @xmath44 without the simplifying assumptions  ( [ dxf ] ) and ( [ dxd ] ) .",
    "the case is that they are known in the current literature  @xcite only at @xmath45 in the collinear approximation . in this approximation",
    "the two - parton distribution functions , @xmath46 with the two hard scales set equal , satisfy the generalized dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations , derived for the first time in refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as single distributions satisfy more known and cited dglap equations  @xcite .",
    "the functions in question have a specific interpretation in the leading logarithm approximation of perturbative qcd : they are inclusive probabilities that in a hadron @xmath47 one finds two bare partons of types @xmath19 and @xmath20 with the given longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .     and @xmath6 are the hard parton subprocesses .",
    "@xmath38 is the momemtum transfered through the ladders @xmath42 and @xmath43 [ fig : fig2],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the evolution equation for @xmath48 contains two terms .",
    "the first term describes independent ( simultaneous ) evolution of two branches of parton cascade : one branch contains the parton @xmath10 and another branch  the parton @xmath11 .",
    "the second term accounts for the possibility to split the one parton evolution ( one branch @xmath49 ) into the two different branches , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it contains the usual splitting function @xmath50 .",
    "the solutions of the generalized dglap evolution equations with the given initial conditions at the reference scales @xmath51 may be written  @xcite in the form : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the qcd coupling , @xmath54 are the known single distribution functions ( the green s functions ) at the parton level with the specific @xmath55-like initial conditions at @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is the initial ( input ) two - parton distribution at a relatively low scale @xmath58 .",
    "the one parton distribution ( before the slitting into the two branches at some scale @xmath59 ) is given by @xmath60 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ solutiontwoscale ] ) we assume that the loop momentum @xmath61 is small and due to a strong ordering of parton transverse momenta during the collinear dglap evolution it may be neglected .",
    "+ the first term is the solution of homogeneous evolution equation ( independent evolution of two branches ) where in general the input two - parton distribution at low scale @xmath58 is not known . for this non - perturbative two - parton function at low @xmath62 one may assume the factorization @xmath63 neglecting the influence of momentum conservation ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath65    since the multiple interactions take place at relatively low transverse momenta , the contribution to the cross section from double scattering can be separated experimentally in the region of relatively low longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the factorization hypothesis  ( [ dxd_q ] ) for the first term is a good approximation . in this case",
    "the cross section for double parton scattering can be estimated , using the two - gluon form factor of the nucleon @xmath66  @xcite for the dominant gluon - gluon scattering mode ( or something similar for other parton scattering modes ) , @xmath67    from the dipole fit @xmath68 to the two - gluon form factor follows that the characteristic value of @xmath38 is of the order of gluon mass @xmath69 , and therefore the initial conditions for the single distributions can be fixed at some reference scale @xmath70 because of the weak logarithmic dependence of these distributions on the scale value . in this approach @xmath71 gives the estimation of @xmath72^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the second term in eq .  ( [ solutiontwoscale ] ) is the solution of complete evolution equation with the evolution from one `` nonperturbative '' parton at the reference scale . here",
    "the independent evolution of two branches starts at scale @xmath59 from a point - like parton @xmath73 .",
    "therefore we have no the form factor @xmath66 which suppresses the large @xmath39 domain . the corresponding contribution to",
    "the cross section reads @xmath74 or in less transparent , but substantially shorter form : @xmath75    there is yet the combined ( `` interference '' ) contribution , which is written by analogy , @xmath76.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equations  ( [ hardab1 ] ) , ( [ d2xd2_s ] ) and ( [ d1xd2_s ] ) are our solution of the problem  the estimation of the inclusive cross section for double parton scattering , taking into account the qcd evolution , in terms of the well - known collinear distributions extracted from deep inelastic scattering .",
    "however , here one should note that the input two - parton distribution @xmath57 may be more complicated than that given by factorization ansatz ( [ dxd_q ] ) .",
    "let us discuss in more detail the second term , that is the @xmath77 contribution .",
    "the contribution to the cross section from the second term induced by the qcd evolution does not reduce to the simple contribution with a some new , other , constant effective cross section @xmath78 , as it was done in first estimations  @xcite .",
    "the qcd evolution effects for the cross section are anticipated to be larger than for the two - parton distribution functions , for which they were estimated in refs .",
    "@xcite on the level of 10@xmath79 -30@xmath79 in comparison with the `` factorization '' components at @xmath80 and @xmath81  gev . indeed , in eq .",
    "( [ d2xd2 ] ) the integration over @xmath38 has no a strong suppression factor @xmath66 and the phase space integral may be estimated as , @xmath82 where within the leading order ( lo ) accuracy we take @xmath83 as the lower limit in @xmath59 and @xmath84 integrations ; at @xmath85 the loop momentum @xmath39 destroys the logarithmic structure of the integrals in collinear evolution from @xmath59 to @xmath86 .",
    "we see that for a large final scale @xmath86 the second ( @xmath77 ) contribution dominates being proportional to @xmath86 in comparison with the @xmath87 or @xmath88 components which contributions @xmath89 are limited by the nucleon ( hadron ) form factor @xmath90   this means that in the second ( @xmath77 ) term two pairs of partons are very close to each other ; @xmath91 . ] .",
    "the real gain is , of course , less , since the running coupling constant and the distribution functions are logarithmically dependent on the integration variables and we have the additional suppression factor , which is inversely proportional  @xcite to the initial gluon and quark multiplicities squared ; due to the different `` normalization '' : the second term evolves from one `` nonperturbative '' parton unlike the first factorization term having the two initial independent `` nonperturbative '' partons at the reference scale .    as a result ,",
    "the experimental effective cross section , @xmath92 , which is not measured directly but is extracted , using the normalization to the product of two single cross sections : @xmath93^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in both the cdf and d0 experiments , should be dependent on the probing hard scale .",
    "it should decrease with the growth of the resolution scale due to the fact that all additional contributions to the cross section of double parton scattering are positive and increase . here",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 are the inclusive @xmath96 jet and dijets cross sections , @xmath97 is the inclusive cross section of the @xmath98 jets events produced in the double parton process .",
    "it is worth noticing that the cdf and d0 collaborations extract @xmath92 without any theoretical predictions on the @xmath96 jet and dijets cross sections , by comparing the number of observed double parton @xmath98 jets events in one @xmath99 collision to the number of @xmath98 jets events with hard interactions occurring in the case of two separate @xmath99 collisions .",
    "the recent d0 measurement  @xcite of this effective cross section , @xmath92 , done as a function of the second ( ordered in the transverse momentum @xmath100 ) jet @xmath100 , @xmath101 , that can serve as a resolution scale , shows a tendency to be dependent on this scale . in ref .",
    "@xcite this fact was interpreted as the first indication to the qcd evolution of double parton distributions .",
    "+ we have to emphasize that the dominant contribution to the phase space integral  ( [ pspace ] ) comes from a large @xmath102 and strictly speaking we have no place for the collinear ( dglap ) evolution of two independent branches of the parton cascade ( i.e. , in the ladders @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) in the @xmath77 term .",
    "formally in the framework of collinear approach this contribution should be considered as that caused by the interaction of _ one _ pair of partons with the @xmath2 hard subprocess  .",
    "recall however that in the estimate ( [ pspace ] ) we neglect the anomalous dimension , @xmath103 , of the parton distributions @xmath104 . in collinear",
    "appoach the anomalous dimensions @xmath105 are assumed to be small . on the other hand in a low @xmath106 region the value of anomalous dimension",
    "is enhanced by the @xmath107 logarithm and may be rather large numerically .",
    "so the integral over @xmath83 is _ slowely _ convergent and the major contribution to the cross section is expected to come actually from some characteristic intermediate region , @xmath108 , with the not such strong sensitivity to the upper limit of @xmath38-integration as in the case of the phase space integral .",
    "therefore it makes sense to consider the numerical contribution of the @xmath77 term even within the collinear approach at the lhc kinematics with the available large enough @xmath14 and @xmath15 with respect to @xmath69 ( providing the wide enough integration region and the characteristic intermediate momenta @xmath38 ) .",
    "next in a configuration with two quite different scales ( say , @xmath109 ) the upper limit of @xmath83 integral is given by a smaller scale ( at @xmath110 the hard matrix element corresponding to @xmath111 starts to fall down with @xmath39 ) . in this case the collinear evolution from the scale @xmath112 up to the scale @xmath15 in the ladders ( parton branches ) @xmath113 and @xmath43 is well justified .",
    "+ moreover the integrals over @xmath114 , @xmath115 in eq .  ( [ d2xd2 ] )",
    "are concentrated at a rather large @xmath116 giving enough space for the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution  @xcite .",
    "thus it may be intersting ( and even more justified theoretically ) to consider the multiple parton interactions in the framework of the bfkl approach ( see the recent paper  @xcite ) . + in summary , we suggest a practical constructive method how to estimate the inclusive cross section for double parton scattering , taking into account the qcd evolution , in terms of the well - known collinear distributions extracted from deep inelastic scattering .",
    "we support also the conclusion of refs .",
    "@xcite that the experimentally measured effective cross section , @xmath92 , at a normalization  ( [ dps ] ) and the presence of the evolution ( correlation ) term in the two - parton distributions , should decrease with the growth of the resolution scale @xmath86 .",
