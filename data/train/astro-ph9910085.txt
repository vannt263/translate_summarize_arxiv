    "superclusters of galaxies are the largest coherent and massive structures known in the universe .",
    "these objects are crucial in cosmology because their extreme characteristics set topological and physical constraints on the models for galaxy and cluster formation .",
    "for this reason , there have been great efforts in order to estimate the extension , shape , mass and dynamical state of these entities .",
    "the most direct way to infer these quantities is to perform a redshift survey in order to map the galaxy distribution in the structure and in its surrounding field , but this method requires a large amount of telescope time and limits the number of targets . up to now",
    "only few of such objects have been studied in detail : the great wall ( geller & huchra 1989 ; ramella et al .",
    "1992 ; dellantonio et al .",
    "1996 ) , the perseus ",
    "( haynes & giovanelli 1986 ) , the hercules ( barmby & huchra 1998 ) , and the corona borealis ( postman , geller & huchra 1988 ; small et al .",
    "1998a ) superclusters .",
    "hudson ( 1993a ) computed the mean overdensity of the superclusters found in his redshift compilation ( @xmath21 km / s ) and estimated that the mean galaxy density excess for these structures is @xmath22 , on scales of the order of @xmath23 ( see also chincarini et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "another way to study superclusters is to detect structures delineated by the distribution of clusters .",
    "this method does not require large redshift surveys and relies on the assumption that clusters and galaxies trace in the same way the underlying matter distribution .",
    "the shapley concentration ( scaramella et al . 1989 ) stands out as the richest system of abell clusters of the list of zucca et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , at every density excess .",
    "in particular , at a density contrast of @xmath24 , it contains 25 members ( at mean velocity of @xmath25 km / s ) contained in a box of comoving size ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 ( hereafter @xmath28 ) . as a comparison , at the same density contrast the great attractor , which is the largest mass condensation within @xmath29 ( lynden  bell et al .",
    "1988 ) , has only 6 members , while corona borealis and hercules are formed by 10 and 8 clusters , respectively .",
    "scaramella et al . (",
    "1989 ) suggested that this supercluster could be responsible of a significant fraction of the acceleration acting on the local group , by adding its dynamical pull to that of the great attractor , which lies approximately in the same direction on the sky at a distance of @xmath30 km / s .",
    "further studies based on the dipole of the distribution of the abell clusters ( scaramella et al .",
    "1991 , plionis & valdarnini 1991 ) confirmed the suggestion that large scales are important for cosmic flows .",
    "attempts to determine the density excess and the mass of the shapley concentration have been made by raychaudhury et al .",

    "( 1997 ) : these authors obtained mass estimates of @xmath31 h@xmath14 m@xmath15 .",
    "these works are essentially based on estimates of the cluster masses , neglecting the contribution of the intercluster matter .",
    "quintana et al .",
    "( 1995 ) gave also a value for the total mass of the supercluster of @xmath32 h@xmath14 m@xmath15 on a scale of @xmath33 , using the virial mass estimator applied to the distribution of clusters .",
    "they computed the velocity dispersion and the virial radius using the mean velocity and the bi - dimensional positions of clusters : this result could be biased if the physical elongation along the line of sight of the supercluster is not negligible .",
    "studying the cluster distribution , at high density contrast the shapley concentration is characterized by three dense complexes of interacting clusters , dominated by a3558 , a3528 and a3571 , respectively . at lower density contrast",
    "these three systems connect to each other through a large cloud of clusters .",
    "the clusters in the a3558 and a3528 complexes appear to be aligned perpendicularly to the line of sight and approximately at the same distance , thus suggesting the presence of an elongated underlying structure .",
    "however , when the whole supercluster is considered , it appears to be extended along the line of sight ( see e.g. figure 4 in tully et al . 1992 and zucca et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the distribution of clusters inside this supercluster is quite well studied ; on the contrary , little is known about the distribution of the intercluster galaxies .",
    "very recently , drinkwater et al . ( 1999 ) performed a redshift survey limited to the magnitude @xmath34 in the southern central part of the shapley concentration , finding evidences of sheets of galaxies connecting the clusters .",
    "the study of the properties of intercluster galaxies is very important in order to assess the physical reality and extension of the structure and to determine if galaxies and clusters trace the matter distribution in the same way . in this context",
    ", we are carrying on a long term multiwavelength study of the central part of the shapley concentration , studying both cluster and intercluster galaxies . in this paper",

    "note that this normalization is also compatible with the cobe normalization , with the exception of scdm@xmath206 , for which this normalization gives predicted values @xmath215 higher .",
    "for this reason , we present the results for scdm with both cobe and cluster normalizations .    in table [ tab : models ] we report the ratio between the linear overdensity and the r.m.s .",

    "our survey is not useful to this purpose , because it covers a small solid angle just in the direction of the shapley concentration .",
    "therefore , we decided to consider the cluster sample used by zucca et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to search for superclusters : this sample covers the whole sky with @xmath216 up to a distance of @xmath158 . in this volume",
    "there are no other superclusters as rich as the shapley concentration .",
    "we computed the ratio between this volume and the volume of our samples listed in table [ tab : overdensity ] : this corresponds to the number of available  probes \" .",
    "given this number , it is possible to estimate the number of @xmath217 over which only 0.25 objects are expected in a gaussian distribution .",
    "this number of @xmath217 is 4.33 for the  total \" sample . if the ratio between the linear overdensity and the r.m.s .",
    "mass fluctuations predicted by the various models exceeds this number of @xmath217 , we expect to have no event like the shapley concentration in the sampled volume .",
    "+ therefore the existence of the shapley concentration is inconsistent with all models in table [ tab : models ] which predict values higher than @xmath218 ; the consistent values are written in italic in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "the most discrepant model is the scdm@xmath206 ; the tcdm and @xmath207cdm give marginally consistent values only in case of high bias . on the contrary ,",
    "all models with a matter density parameter @xmath19 seem to be compatible with the existence of a shapley concentration  event \" . finally , note that the scdm@xmath205 appears to give the lowest values , but this model is inconsistent with other results obtained on the scales of galaxies and clusters ( see e.g. peacock & dodds 1996 ) .",
    "we have presented the results of a redshift survey of intercluster galaxies toward the central part of the shapley concentration supercluster , aimed at determining the distribution of galaxies in between obvious overdensities .",
    "our sample is formed by 442 new redshifts mainly in the @xmath0 magnitude range @xmath63 .",
    "together with our redshift surveys on the a3558 and a3528 complexes , our total sample has @xmath2 velocities .",
    "our main results are the following : +  the average velocity of the observed intercluster galaxies in the shapley concentration appears to be a function of the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) position , and can be fitted by a plane in the three  dimensional space ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) : the distribution of the galaxy distances around the best fit plane is described by a gaussian with a dispersion of @xmath6 . +  using the 1440 galaxies of our sample in the magnitude range @xmath1 , we reconstructed the density profile in the central part of the shapley concetration and we detected another significant overdensity at @xmath7 km / s ( dubbed s300 ) .",
    "+  we estimated the total overdensity in galaxies , the mass and the dynamical state of these structures , discussing the effect of considering a bias between the galaxy distribution and the underlying matter .",
    "the estimated total overdensity in galaxies of these two structures is @xmath219 on scale of @xmath9 for the shapley concentration and @xmath220 on scale of @xmath11 for s300 .",
    "if light traces the mass distribution , the corresponding masses are @xmath12 @xmath13 h@xmath14 m@xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath13 h@xmath14 m@xmath15 for shapley concentration and s300 , respectively .",
    "+ the dynamical analysis revealed that , if light traces mass and @xmath17 , the shapley concentration already reached its turnaround radius and started to collapse : the final collapse will happen in @xmath18 h@xmath14 yrs .",
    "+  we compared our mass estimates on various scales with other results in the literature , finding a general agreement . +  we found an indication that the value of the bias between clusters and galaxies in the shapley concentration is higher than that reported in literature , confirming the impression that this supercluster is very rich in clusters .",
    "+  finally from the comparison with some theoretical scenarios , we found that the shapley concentration is more consistent with the predictions of the models with a matter density parameter @xmath19 , such as open cdm and @xmath20cdm .",

    "<S> we present the results of a redshift survey of intercluster galaxies in the central region of the shapley concentration supercluster , aimed at determining the distribution of galaxies in between obvious overdensities . </S>",
    "<S> our sample is formed by 442 new redshifts , mainly in the @xmath0 magnitude range @xmath1 . adding the data from our redshift surveys on the a3558 and a3528 complexes , which are close to the geometrical centre of this supercluster </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a total sample of @xmath2 radial velocities . </S>",
    "<S> + the average velocity of the observed intercluster galaxies in the shapley concentration appears to be a function of their ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) position , and it can be fitted by a plane in the three  dimensional space ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) : the distribution of the galaxy distances around the best fit plane is described by a gaussian with dispersion @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> + using the 1440 galaxies of our total sample in the magnitude range @xmath1 , we reconstructed the density profile in the central part of the shapley concetration ; moreover we detected another significant overdensity at @xmath7 km / s ( dubbed s300 ) . </S>",
    "<S> + we estimate the total overdensity in galaxies , the mass and the dynamical state of these structures , and discuss the effect of considering a bias between the galaxy distribution and the underlying matter . + the estimated total overdensity in galaxies of these two structures is @xmath8 on scale of @xmath9 for the shapley concentration and @xmath10 on scale of @xmath11 for s300 . </S>",
    "<S> if light traces the mass distribution , the corresponding masses are @xmath12 @xmath13 h@xmath14 m@xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath13 h@xmath14 m@xmath15 for shapley concentration and s300 , respectively . + </S>",
    "<S> a dynamical analysis suggests that , if light traces mass and @xmath17 , the shapley concentration already reached its turnaround radius and has started to collapse : the final collapse will happen in @xmath18 h@xmath14 yrs . </S>",
    "<S> + we find an indication that the value of the bias between clusters and galaxies in the shapley concentration is higher that that reported in literature , confirming the impression that this supercluster is very rich in clusters . </S>",
    "<S> + finally , from the comparison with some theoretical scenarios , we find that the existence of the shapley concentration is more consistent with the predictions of the models with a matter density parameter @xmath19 , such as open cdm and @xmath20cdm .    </S>",
