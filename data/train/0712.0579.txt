    "outflow and jet studies in high - mass star - forming regions have revealed ample indirect evidence that accretion disks should be common in these regions .",
    "however direct observational characterization of such disks has so far been difficult ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while this is partly caused by the typically large distances and the clustered mode of massive star formation , an additional problem arises because these regions are still deeply embedded within their natal cores , they have visual extinctions of the order 1000 , making it difficult to disentangle the dense core emission from the genuine accretion disks . in the past ,",
    "different molecular line tracers were employed for different massive star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , however , it is interesting to note that for many sources only one or two molecular lines exclusively indicated rotating motions whereas many other promising spectral lines showed no such signatures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of identifying a reliable massive disk tracer prohibited statistical studies of larger disk samples , until today . here",
    "we present new observations toward the massive disk candidate iras18089 - 1732 in the high - excitation ammonia lines nh@xmath0(4,4 ) and ( 5,5 ) , with lower energy levels of 200 and 295k , respectively .",
    "while the high excitation temperatures ensure that we are not tracing the cold gas envelope but only the warm central regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , recent radiative transfer calculations of 3d hydrodynamic massive core simulations indicated that the wavelength regime @xmath4ghz should be particularly advantageous to studying the inner disk regions @xcite .",
    "this work predicts high dust optical depths at frequencies @xmath3100ghz potentially limiting spectral line studies of the central disk in the ( sub)mm regime .",
    "the target iras18089 - 1732 has previously been studied at ( sub)mm wavelengths with the submillimeter array , and a velocity gradient was identified from east to west , perpendicular to the molecular outflow emanating from the core approximately in north - south direction @xcite .",
    "however , these data did not resolve the velocity pattern of this structure and hence did not allow to study its kinematic properties .",
    "the region is located at @xmath13.6kpc , it has a bolometric luminosity of about @xmath5l@xmath6 , and it exhibits several other signs of early massive star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "iras18089 - 1732 was observed in april 2007 with the atca in a 1.5 km baseline configuration including antenna 6 .",
    "the phase reference center was r.a .",

    "we observed the nh@xmath0(4,4 ) and ( 5,5 ) inversion lines with the frequencies of the main hyperfine components at 24.139 and 24.533ghz , respectively .",
    "the velocity relative to the local standard of rest ( @xmath9 ) is @xmath10kms@xmath11 .",
    "phase and amplitude were calibrated by regular observations of the quasar 1829 - 207 .",
    "bandpass and flux were calibrated with observations of 1741 - 038 and 1934 - 638 .",
    "the spectral resolution of the observations was 62khz corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath12kms@xmath11 . applying a robust weighting of 0.5 ,",
    "the @xmath13 rms per 0.8kms@xmath11 channel is @xmath12.5mjybeam@xmath11 .",
    "the synthesized beam is @xmath14 with a position angle of 8.5@xmath15 . because the outflow is in the north - south direction @xcite and the expected accretion disk in the east - west direction ,",
    "the small synthesized beam along the east - west axis is fortunate for the analysis .      to improve the beam shape",
    ", we observed the same region in october 2007 with the vla / evla hybrid array in an extended configurations ( bna ) in the nh@xmath0(5,5 ) line . due to mediocre weather conditions and a worse performance of the retrofitted evla antennas at high frequencies , we could not usefully include the longest baselines , restricting the data to uv - ranges @xmath16500k@xmath17 .",
    "bandpass and flux calibration were conducted with 1331 + 305 and 1733 - 130 .",
    "fast switching between source and phase calibrator 1832 - 105 were applied to calibrate the phases and amplitudes .",
    "the original spectral resolution of 48.8khz was smoothed in the final data - cube to 1.0kms@xmath11 .",
    "applying natural weighting and restoring the data with a circular beam ( degraded to the larger axis of the fit to the dirty beam ) the synthesized beam of these data is @xmath18 .",
    "it was also possible to extract a 1.2 cm continuum map from the line - free part of the spectrum .",
    "for this image we included longer baselines as well and the synthesized beam is @xmath19 with a pa of 84@xmath15 from north .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents a compilation of the atca data compared to the submm continuum emission tracing the central dust and gas core @xcite . as expected the warm gas observed in the nh@xmath0 lines",
    "traces the central core well",
    ". however , more interesting is the velocity structure of the region .",
    "the two first moment maps ( the intensity weighted velocities ) of the nh@xmath0(4,4 ) and ( 5,5 ) data - cubes both exhibit a velocity gradient from east to west , perpendicular to the molecular outflow emanating approximately in north - south direction @xcite .",
    "the north - south elongation seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is caused by the non - symmetric beam shape . to improve on that , we re -",
    "observed the source in the nh@xmath0(5,5 ) line with the vla , fig.[fig2 ] presents and integrated and a first moment map of these data .",
    "the velocity gradient in east - west direction is obvious again .",
    "the fact that the nh@xmath0 structure is not flattened could be either due to a viewing - angle of the rotating structure close to face - on , or , since the nh@xmath0 features in the north and south are close to the @xmath9 , they may also contain contributions from the ambient core .",
    "in addition to the spectral line data , fig .  [ fig2 ] presents the simultaneously with the vla observed 1.2 cm continuum map .",
    "the cm emission shows a double - lobe structure in north - south direction with the dip centered on the submm continuum peak .",
    "the integrated emission of this double - lobe is 7.4mjy . in combination with the previously observed 3.6 cm flux of 0.9mjy , the spectral index between these two wavelengths",
    "is @xmath12 , consistent with an ionized , optically thick jet @xcite .",
    "since the molecular outflow is also in north - south direction we identify this double - lobe cm continuum emission with the central jet perpendicular to the rotation axis of the gas .    to get a better impression of the velocity field along the inferred rotation axis , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows a position - velocity digram cut through the submm continuum peak position along the east - west axis . for this analysis",
    ", we use the atca nh@xmath0(4,4 ) data because they combine the best signal - to - noise ratio with the highest spectral and angular resolution along the given axis .",
    "the velocity gradient is clearly depicted here as well . with a spatial resolution of @xmath20along this axis",
    ", the structure with an approximate size of @xmath21 is well resolved and consistent with rotation of a potential massive accretion disk . furthermore , with a linear resolution of @xmath11400au , these observations allow us , for the first time , to better characterize the kinematics of the rotating structure .",
    "refering to the relatively simple picture of low - mass accretion disks which are in keplerian rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we can calculate the rotationally supported binding mass @xmath22 for iras18089 - 1732 assuming equilibrium between the rotational and gravitational force at the outer radius of the disk .",
    "@xmath23 & = &   1.13\\,10^{-3 } \\times \\delta v^2[\\rm{km / s}]\\times r[\\rm{au } ] \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath24 is the disk radius ( @xmath253600au ) , and @xmath26 half the velocity regime observed in the first moment maps ( @xmath13kms@xmath11 , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "equations [ eq1 ] & [ eq2 ] have to be divided by sin@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unknown inclination angle between the disk plane and the plane of the sky ( @xmath29 for an edge - on system ) . with the given values",
    ", we can estimate @xmath22 to @xmath30/(sin@xmath27)m@xmath6 .",
    "this mass estimate is comparable to the core mass estimates from the submm dust continuum emission ( about 45m@xmath6 , @xcite ) .",
    "a different way to assess potential ( non-)keplerian components in the velocity structure is to draw an expected keplerian velocity profile for a 15m@xmath6 protostar on the position - velocity diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for the mass estimate see the following paragraph ) .",
    "while for blue - shifted velocities and positive offsets the position - velocity structure does approximately follow the keplerian profile , the red - shifted emission at negative velocities deviates more strongly from the synthetic profile , even showing super - keplerian velocities in excess of the keplerian speed .",
    "furthermore , there are additional components in the position - velocity digram , for example the strong peak at ( 31kms@xmath11 , @xmath31 ) that does not fit a typical keplerian disk .",
    "how can we explain the non - keplerian signatures in the rotating structure ?",
    "even at the highest angular resolution ( continuum and line data in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , the source remains a single - peaked structure without exhibiting signs of multiplicity .",
    "although massive star formation usually proceeds in a clustered mode , this indicates that most of the bolometric luminosity of @xmath5l@xmath6 likely stems from the most massive central object . assuming a main sequence star this would give an upper mass limit of 20m@xmath6 for the central object .",
    "since the source is likely still in its accretion phase , it has additional accretion luminosity @xcite and the actual protostellar mass may be lower .",
    "however , estimating for example the accretion luminosity @xmath32 for a star of @xmath33m@xmath6 with a radius of @xmath3410r@xmath6 and an accretion rate of @xmath35m@xmath6yr@xmath11 , one derives an @xmath36 of only @xmath15@xmath37l@xmath6 .",
    "although especially @xmath38 and @xmath39 could both vary by a factor of a few ( e.g. , @xcite ) it is unlikely that the accretion luminosity contributes more than a factor two to the overall luminosity .",
    "therefore , we estimate the mass of the central protostar to be likely between 15 and 20m@xmath6 . compared to the mass of the potential protostar / disk system calculated either from the dust continuum emission or estimated via the rotational support assumption , the actual protostellar mass is more than a factor 2 lower .",
    "hence , a keplerian supported disk , where the disk mass is negligible compared to the protostellar mass , is not feasible in such a system . because of the velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] & [ fig2 ] ) and the comparatively low velocities compared to molecular outflows , it is unlikely that these features are due to unbound motions , e.g. , from the molecular outflow .",
    "the more likely interpretation is that we are dealing with a massive rotating structure not in keplerian rotation .",
    "candidates for the non - keplerian contributions are a rotating and infalling envelope and a potentially self - gravitating disk structure .",
    "for example , an infalling and rotating envelope produces similar features in the position - velocity diagram like the blue - shifted peak at ( 31kms@xmath11 , @xmath31 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( see , e.g. , fig .  10 in @xcite ) .",
    "such rotating , infalling envelope structures could resemble the proposed larger - scale toroids that are observed toward a small number of even more luminous sources @xcite .",
    "it is expected that such toroidal non - equilibrium structures should be gravitationally unstable , maybe forming companion sources @xcite , which then could produce additional kinematic signatures . in a similar direction",
    ", @xcite and @xcite modeled the accretion flow around high - mass stars : in their case , the gas orbits on ballistic trajectories around a point mass ( see also @xcite ) , and the accretion flow appears quasi - spherical at large distances from the star , flattening to a disk at smaller radii due to conservation of angular momentum ( see fig . 9 in @xcite ) . also noteworthy",
    "are the red - shifted super - keplerian gas velocities exceeding the keplerian speed .",
    "while sub - keplerian disks are predicted for disks with significant additional support against gravity than rotation ( e.g. , magnetic field , @xcite ) , super - keplerian velocities are expected if the disk contributes a significant fraction of the mass to the protostar - disk system . in this case",
    ", the outer disk rotates faster because it feels the gravitational force of the protostar and the inner disk ( e.g. , @xcite and krumholz priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "in addition to the kinematic analysis , ammonia is a well known thermometer for molecular gas @xcite .",
    "however , because even these high - excitation lines still have high optical depths ( @xmath40 ) we can not accurately fit the hyperfine structure of the lines .",
    "therefore , reasonable rotational temperature estimates are not feasible .",
    "nevertheless , the detection of spectral lines with excitation temperatures @xmath41k implies that the average gas temperatures should exceed 100k , consistent with previous temperature estimates based on hcooch@xmath0 and ch@xmath0cn observations at ( sub)mm wavelengths @xcite .",
    "while the previous ( sub)mm temperature estimates were based on data that did not resolve the kinematics of the rotating structure and therefore could be attributed to the disk and/or envelope , the nh@xmath0 data clearly show that the central rotating structure harbors large amounts of warm gas at temperatures @xmath3100k .",
    "this is markedly different to typical low - mass disks where the bulk of the gas is at low temperatures @xmath4230k @xcite .",
    "from an observational point of view , this work shows that high - excitation lines at 1.2 cm wavelengths are well suited to study the kinematics around massive protostars .",
    "while massive accretion disk research in recent years has mostly focused on ( sub)mm interferometer observations , this may not be the ideal wavelength regime because of high optical depth in the innermost regions @xcite . although there exist examples of nh@xmath0 disk studies , these were usually done in the low excitation lines nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such low - energy line observations suffer from contributions of the cold envelope material , and high - excitation nh@xmath0 observations like those presented here may turn out to be one of the best tracers of the central accretion disks around high - mass protostars . statistically larger samples have to be investigated this way to base our knowledge on more solid ground .    in summary",
    ", these observations disentangle the kinematics , the mass and the temperature of the rotating structure around a high - mass protostar , identifying a hot massive accretion disk candidate .",
    "the kinematic signatures are different from typical keplerian velocity profiles known from low - mass star formation .",
    "these discrepancies could be produced by larger - scale rotating and infalling toroids or envelopes as well as by self - gravitating structures within the massive accretion disk .",
    "the estimated gas temperature is @xmath3100k which is also significantly larger than average temperatures from low - mass accretion disks .",
    "while the angular resolution of @xmath20 is very high , corresponding to a projected linear resolution of @xmath11400au , we are still not resolving the inner accretion disk regions .",
    "notwithstanding the fact that the larger - scale disk - like structure observed here deviates from typical keplerian disk structures , it may be possible that such structures exist on even smaller scales closer to the central protostar .",
    "future observational tests include high - spatial - resolution observations with alma and the completed evla , as well as spatially and spectrally resolved observations of vibrationally excited co lines observable at mid - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , crires on vlt ) ."
