    "diffractive scattering processes are characterized by small momentum transfer , @xmath7  gev@xmath8 , and thus governed by non - perturbative qcd . to get more insight in the physics at work we investigate exclusive vector meson production by real and virtual photons . in this note",
    "we summarize recent results from ref .",

    "@xcite we have developed a framework which we here can only flash .",
    "we consider high - energy diffractive collision of a photon which dissociates into a @xmath3-dipole and transforms into a vector meson with a proton in the quark - diquark picture which remains intact .",
    "the scattering @xmath9-amplitude can be written as an integral of the dipole - dipole amplitude and the corresponding wave functions .",
    "integrating out the proton side , we have @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the final vector meson and @xmath12 for the initial photon with definite helicities @xmath13 ( and virtuality @xmath14 ) ; @xmath15 is the light - cone momentum fraction of the quark , @xmath16 the transverse extension of the @xmath3-dipole .",
    "the function @xmath17 is the interaction amplitude for a dipole @xmath18 scattering on a proton with fixed momentum transfer @xmath19 ; for @xmath20 due to the optical theorem it is the corresponding total coss section ( see below eq .",
    "( [ sigma_dipole ] ) ) .",
    "it is calculated within non - perturbative qcd : in the high - energy limit nachtmann  @xcite derived a non - perturbative formula for dipole - dipole scattering whose basic entity is the vacuum expectation value of two lightlike wilson loops .",
    "this gets evaluated in the model of the stochastic qcd vacuum  @xcite .",
    "coming from the functional integral approach the model of the stochastic qcd vacuum  @xcite assumes that the non - perturbative part of the gauge field measure , i.e. long - range gluon fluctuations that are associated with a non - trivial vacuum structure of qcd , can be approximated by a stochastic process in the gluon field strengths with convergent cumulant expansion . further assuming this process to be gaussian one arrives at a description through the second cumulant @xmath21 which has two lorentz tensor structures multiplied by correlation functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
