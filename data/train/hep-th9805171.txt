    "the description of certain charged black holes as d - branes in string theory implies a connection between the low - energy gauge dynamics on the brane and the low energy supergravity in spacetime .   recently , maldacena has proposed decoupling limits in which the brane gauge dynamics is dual to string theory on the near - horizon anti - de sitter geometry of the corresponding black hole  @xcite .",
    "a more precise definition of this duality was developed in  @xcite .",
    "we associate to the string compactification on @xmath6 a conformal field theory living on a space conformal to the @xmath7-dimensional boundary @xmath8 of the ads factor . to each field @xmath9 there is a corresponding local operator @xmath10 in the conformal field theory .",
    "the relation between string theory in the bulk and field theory on the boundary is : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the effective action in the bulk , @xmath13 is the field @xmath9 restricted to the boundary , and @xmath14 is the time - ordering symbol in the field theory on @xmath8 . the expectation value on the right hand side is taken in the boundary field theory , with @xmath13 treated as a source term . in the classical supergravity limit , given a boundary field we solve for the corresponding bulk field and use it to relate the bulk effective action to boundary correlation functions .    in euclidean ads",
    "this proposal used the absence of normalizable solutions to the field equations , and the resulting unique extension of a boundary field @xmath13 into the bulk  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in issues of spacetime causal structure and dynamics , so we would also like a hamiltonian formulation of the bulk theory in lorentzian signature ads spaces .",
    "the standard construction of quantum field theory depends on the existence of a complete set of normalizable modes , which is in tension with the unique extendibility of ads boundary conditions into the bulk .",
    "indeed , several consistent quantizations have been found  @xcite , involving particular choices of boundary conditions for ads spacetimes and the resulting set of normalizable modes . on the other hand ,",
    "the bulk - boundary correspondence demands the ability to tune the boundary conditions in order to describe the appropriate boundary correlation functions . in this paper",
    "we resolve these tensions by arguing that the bulk - boundary correspondence as formulated in  @xcite demands the inclusion of both normalizable and non - normalizable modes .",
    "the former propagate in the bulk and correspond to physical states while the latter serve as classical , non - fluctuating backgrounds and encode the choice of operator insertions in the boundary theory .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] by reviewing the computation of boundary correlation functions , and providing a prescription for computing the bulk effective action in a hamiltonian formulation .",
    "we will argue that specifying the boundary conditions involves turning on non - normalizable modes which do not fluctuate . including such non - fluctuating modes may seem strange , but several well - known examples exist in other contexts : a classic example is a field theory which undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking , and more recent related examples arise in @xcite .",
    "normalizable solutions to the wave equation are then used in the mode expansion of operators and the construction of a fock space .",
    "the resulting hilbert space of states is identified with the hilbert space of the boundary theory  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : norm ] we make this more explicit by studying solutions to the wave equation for free scalars of arbitrary mass .",
    "we find that for general masses , the field equations have both normalizable and non - normalizable solutions and the latter couple to the boundary .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ads3 ] we specialize to @xmath0 , whose bulk isometry group and boundary conformal group are both @xmath15 .",

    "interesting subtleties arise for small masses and for integral @xmath18 .",
    "we carry out the analysis in both global and poincar coordinates in order to discuss conformal field theories both on the cylinder and the plane .",
    "the latter case has some curious features because poincar coordinates only cover a patch of the global spacetime .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion of the utility and limitations of the bulk - boundary correspondence for describing bulk spacetime physics via the boundary gauge theory .",
    "[ [ euclidean - formulation ] ] euclidean formulation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    specifying the boundary behaviour of a field @xmath19 in euclidean ads leads to a unique solution to the equations of motion , given some regularity conditions ( see  @xcite for discussion and references ) .",
    "so ( [ eq : bbrel ] ) is unambiguously interpreted by evaluating the @xmath20 effective action on the unique bulk extension of the boundary field . for a free scalar @xmath19 with boundary value @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath22 we relate this to the right hand side of ( [ eq : bbrel ] ) by integrating by parts .",
    "since @xmath19 is a solution to the equations of motion , the bulk contribution vanishes .",
    "there is , however , a boundary term which is non - vanishing for the relevant solutions to the euclidean wave equation : @xmath23 ( here @xmath24 is the boundary of spacetime in the poincar coordinates defined in the appendix . ) as @xmath25 this is quadratic in @xmath21 and can be thought of as a quantity in the boundary theory . in order to compare to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : bbrel ] )",
    ", we must identify the boundary operator coupling to @xmath19 .",
    "the dimension of the operator is determined by the growth of @xmath19 at the boundary of ads  @xcite .",
    "in particular , suppose that the boundary behavior of @xmath19 is @xmath26 then the corresponding operator has mass dimension @xmath27 . in fact , this procedure is not completely well - defined : in general , ( [ eq : boundpart ] ) blows up and some regularization is required in order to extract the correlator @xcite . for interacting theories , we can calculate @xmath12 perturbatively by integrating over fluctuations away from the classical solution .",
    "these fluctuations should have finite action and vanish appropriately at the boundary .",
    "[ [ lorentzian - formulation ] ] lorentzian formulation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in lorentzian signature ads spacetime the relation in ( [ eq : bbrel ] ) is more subtle , because there are normalizable solutions to the wave equation  @xcite which do not affect the leading boundary behavior ( [ eq : boundlim ] ) .",
    "so the boundary value @xmath21 does not uniquely specify the bulk field .",
    "furthermore , the normalizable modes can not be projected out since they are needed to expand quantum operators , build a fock space , and compute green s functions in the bulk .",
    "the bulk effective action appearing in ( [ eq : bbrel ] ) can be written as : @xmath28 where the path integral is taken over fields @xmath9 that take the boundary value @xmath13 .",
    "the measure @xmath29 can be normalized by requiring that @xmath30 when the boundary condition is trivial ( @xmath31 ) . in general",
    "there is a set of saddle points that must be summed over ; these correspond to the normalizable modes that are solutions to the equations of motion with a fixed boundary condition . for a free theory in minkowski space ,",
    "the normalizable modes indicate that there is a manifold of flat directions that must be integrated over for fixed boundary behavior . for a free theory the calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite  are not affected as the flat directions lead to an overall volume factor that is divided out when we appropriately normalize the path integral .    in order to define the path integral in ( [ eq : path1 ] ) we must specify the behaviour of fields at the ads boundary .",
    "we will see that boundary conditions can be specified by including certain modes that are generically not normalizable or at least perturb the asymptotic geometry too violently .",
    "in fact , these are precisely the modes that are identified in @xcite  with sources coupling to boundary operators . as such",
    ", these modes should be locked or non - fluctuating .",
    "such non - fluctuating modes arise in a variety of contexts .",
    "one example is the homogeneous mode of a scalar field that takes a nonzero value through spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "another example is euclidean field theory on spaces with constant negative curvature ; the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite note that the large volume at infinity keeps modes with certain boundary conditions from fluctuating .",
    "our discussion is particularly reminiscent of liouville theory , where local operators create non - normalizable wavefunctions when inserted in a disc amplitude @xcite .",
    "this analogy is especially attractive after the work in @xciteand was a motivation for the present form of this paper ; indeed , for @xmath0 the gravity sector of the bulk has a chern - simons action which reduces to a boundary liouville theory  @xcite . in particular ref .",
    "@xcite  relates the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the wave equation to the gravitational dressing of chiral operators in the boundary cft .    for an interacting theory ,",
    "our prescription provides the analog of an s - matrix for field theories in ads space , an issue raised in ref .",
    "@xcite . in standard flat - space field theory ,",
    "one specifies boundary conditions at infinity by turning off the interactions and physically separating the initial excitations , so that we can sensibly discuss asymptotic states . in our picture , even though the bulk excitations may not be separable and asymptotic states may not exist , we can sensibly discuss the dependence of the partition function on boundary conditons for locked fields at infinity .",
    "[ [ hamiltonian - quantization ] ] hamiltonian quantization : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    once we have specified the boundary conditions , we must ask what fluctuating modes to keep in a hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the point is that quantization requires a complete , normalizable set of field modes , which in ads space requires some sort of boundary condition at infinity .",
    "several consistent choices have been suggested in the past ; for the bulk - boundary correspondence to make sense the choice should be unambiguously determined by the physics of the situation .",
    "our prescription is heavily motivated by the work of breitenlohner and freedman @xcite ( which covers @xmath32 ) , so we will review their discussion for scalars of arbitrary mass @xmath33 in @xmath20 ( also see @xcite ) .    fix a spacelike slice @xmath34 with coordinates @xmath35 and an orthogonal , timelike coordinate @xmath36 . given two solutions @xmath37 to the scalar wave equation ,",
    "define the inner product : @xmath38",
    "if @xmath39 , this is the integral of the time component of the current @xmath40 here @xmath41 is only time - independent up to boundary terms coming from the timelike boundary of anti - de sitter space ; it is easy to see , using the equations of motion , that @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the boundary of the spacelike slice .",
    "the authors of  @xcite  find complete sets of modes by demanding , first , that the flux normal to the boundary vanish at infinity .",
    "they also demand that no energy is exchanged with the boundary : @xmath44 the authors of  @xcite considered the relative merits of the canonical and improved stress tensors in this equation .",
    "this potential ambiguity in the stress tensor arises because the curvature is constant , and its possible coupling to a scalar field would appear as an effective mass term . in our case",
    "the choice is dictated by the underlying string theory and the supergravity effective action that descends from it .",
    "we will simply treat scalar fields of mass squared @xmath45 with the understanding that the mass term may contain a contribution from a curvature coupling .",
    "we will find that for masses @xmath46 , simply requiring normalizability is sufficient to isolate a suitable class of fluctuating solutions , and the more refined discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite  is unnecessary . for @xmath47 ( stability requires @xmath48 ) ,",
    "there are two sets of normalizable solutions and some criterion is needed to distinguish them . refs .",
    "@xcite show that for any given field propagating on @xmath49 , conservation of the inner product ( [ eq : adsnorm ] ) and the vanishing of @xmath50 at the boundary requires either but not both sets .",
    "furthermore , in the case of @xmath32 , the authors of @xcite show that the two sets of modes are built on representations of the conformal algebra with different lowest energy states and that supersymmetry generically requires one to take both types of mode into account .",
    "the clearest example is that of the scalar and pseudoscalar in the gravity supermultiplet of gauged @xmath51 supergravity @xcite . both are conformally coupled , and supersymmetry requires that the modes of the scalar lie in one representation while the modes of the pseudoscalar lie in the other .",
    "further criteria are needed , however , to decide which assignment is realized . in this particular case , hawking @xcite imposed the requirement that the metric be asymptotically anti - de sitter ( in a sense defined in that work ) to find particular boundary conditions on the linearized metric perturbations .",
    "supersymmetry then requires the scalar mode to live in the representation whose highest - weight state has the lowest energy",
    ". it would be nice if similar criteria could be applied to general modes in the range @xmath47 , independently of supersymmetry ; we will not investigate this point , however .",
    "[ [ summary ] ] summary : + + + + + + + + +    the lesson is that we need to keep both normalizable and non - normalizable modes in ads spacetimes .",
    "the non - normalizable modes correspond to operator insertions in the boundary gauge theory ; from the ads point of view they provide non - trivial boundary conditions .",
    "the normalizable modes fluctuate in the bulk ; quanta occupying such modes have a dual description in the boundary hilbert space . in path",
    "integral language , ( [ eq : bbrel ] ) can be understood via the background field expansion : we compute the effective action by expanding the path integral of the bulk theory as @xmath52 @xmath53 is a classical , nonnormalizable solution to the equations of motion , corresponding to an operator insertion at infinity and a particular choice of boundary conditions .",
    "then @xmath54 is the fluctuating piece over which we integrate to get the partition function .",

    "this solution is non - normalizable at the boundary at infinity but well - behaved in the interior .",
    "the second , independent solution @xmath63 is very badly behaved ( i.e. blows up exponentially ) in the interior and is therefore eliminated .",
    "if we consider anti - de sitter space as the near - horizon geometry of a brane , then in the asymptotically flat region @xmath64 would have imaginary momentum perpendicular to the brane .    for @xmath65 , there are two possible solutions which are regular in the interior .",
