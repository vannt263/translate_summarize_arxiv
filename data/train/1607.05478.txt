    "the masses @xmath11 of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centres of normal early - type galaxies and bulges correlate with various global properties of the stellar spheroids ",
    "see @xcite for a comprehensive review .",
    "the strongest relationships include one between @xmath11 and the bulge mass @xmath12 ( either stellar or dynamical , depending on the author : e.g. , @xcite ) ; a scaling of @xmath11 with the ( aperture ) stellar velocity dispersion @xmath13 averaged inside some fraction of the effective radius @xmath1 of the bulge ( @xmath14 if fitted with a single power law : @xcite ) ; and a fundamental - plane dependence of @xmath11 on a combination of either @xmath12 and @xmath13 or @xmath13 and @xmath1 ( @xcite ) . whether any one correlation is more fundamental than the others is something of an open question , but collectively they are interpreted as evidence for co - evolution between smbhs and their host galaxies .",
    "this co - evolution likely involved self - regulated feedback in general .",
    "most of the smbh mass in large galaxies is grown in a quasar phase of eddington - rate accretion @xcite , driven by a rapid succession of gas - rich mergers at high redshift .",
    "such accretion deposits significant momentum and energy back into the protogalactic gas supply , which can lead to a blow - out that stops further accretion onto the smbh . in this context",
    ", the empirical correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath13 takes on particular importance , as the stellar velocity dispersion should reflect the depth of the potential well from which smbh feedback had to expel the protogalactic gas .",
    "cosmological simulations of galaxy formation now routinely include prescriptions for the quenching of eddington - rate accretion by `` quasar - mode '' feedback , with free parameters that are tuned to give good fits to the smbh @xmath15@xmath16 relation at @xmath0 .    however , it is not clear in detail how the stellar velocity dispersions in normal galaxies at @xmath0 relate to the protogalactic potential wells when any putative blow - out occurred and the main phase of accretion - driven smbh growth came to an end . for most systems , this was presumably around @xmath173 , when quasar activity in the universe was at its peak @xcite .",
    "the potential wells in question were dominated by dark matter , and a general method is lacking to connect the stellar @xmath13 in spheroids to the properties of their dark - matter halos , not only at @xmath0 but at higher redshift as well .",
    "moreover , it is not necessarily obvious what specific property ( or properties ) of dark - matter halos provides the key measure of potential - well depth in the context of a condition for accretion - driven blow - out . different simulations of galaxy and smbh co - evolution with different recipes for quasar - mode feedback appear equally able ( with appropriate tuning of their free parameters ) to reproduce the observed @xmath15@xmath16 relation .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to address the first part of this problem .",
    "we develop `` mean - trend '' scaling relations between the average stellar properties ( total masses , effective radii and aperture velocity dispersions ) and the dark - matter halos ( virial masses and radii , density profiles and circular - speed curves ) of two - component spherical galaxies .",
    "these scalings are constrained by some data for a representative sample of local early - type galaxies , and by the properties of dark - matter halos at @xmath0 in cosmological simulations .",
    "we then include an analytical approximation to the mass and potential - well growth histories of simulated dark - matter halos , in order to connect the stellar properties at @xmath0 to halo properties at @xmath18 .",
    "we ultimately use these results to illustrate how one particularly simple analytical expression , which gives a critical smbh mass for protogalactic blow - out directly in terms of the dark - matter potential well at quasar redshifts , translates to a relation between smbh mass and stellar velocity dispersion at @xmath0 .      under the assumption ( which we discuss just below ) that accretion feedback is momentum - conserving and",
    "takes the form of a spherical shell driven outwards by an smbh wind with momentum flux @xmath19 , @xcite derive a minimum smbh mass sufficient to expel an initially static and virialised gaseous medium from any protogalaxy consisting of dark matter and gas only .",
    "this critical mass is approximately @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the thomson - scattering opacity and @xmath22 is the ( spatially constant ) gas - to - dark matter mass fraction in the protogalaxy .",
    "the velocity scale @xmath23 refers to the _ peak _ value of the circular speed @xmath24 in a dark - matter halo with mass profile @xmath25 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) holds for any form of the mass profile , just so long as the associated circular - speed curve has a single , global maximum  as all realistic descriptions of the halos formed in cosmological @xmath26-body simulations do . defining a characteristic ( dark - matter ) velocity dispersion as @xmath27 turns equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) into a critical @xmath11@xmath28 relation , which is formally the same as that obtained by @xcite , and similar to the earlier result of @xcite , for momentum - driven blow - out from a singular isothermal sphere .    ) with a protogalactic gas - to - dark matter fraction @xmath29 and @xmath30 for all galaxies .",
    "improving upon this poorly - justified association between the characteristic stellar and dark - matter velocities in early - type galaxies is one of the goals of this paper.,width=313 ]    this critical mass is based on the simplified description given by @xcite of a compton - thick wind resulting from accretion at or above the eddington rate onto an smbh . in particular , their analysis provides the assumption that the momentum flux in the smbh wind is simply @xmath31 ( with no pre - factor ) . the wind from an smbh with mass greater than that in equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) will then supply an outwards force ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) on a thin , radiative shell of swept - up ambient gas that exceeds the gravitational attraction of dark matter behind the shell ( maximum force @xmath33 if the gas was initially virialised ) , _ everywhere _ in the halo .",
    "it is a condition for the clearing of all gas to beyond the virial radius of any non - isothermal halo",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) has limitations .",
    "most notably , the protogalactic outflows driven by smbh winds are in fact expected to become energy - driven ( non - radiative ) after an initial radiative phase @xcite",
    ". this may @xcite or may not @xcite change the functional dependence of a critical @xmath11 for blow - out on the dark - matter @xmath23 or any other characteristic halo velocity scale . beyond this , the equation also assumes a wind moving into an initially static ambient medium , ignoring the cosmological infall of gas and an additional , confining ram pressure that comes with hierarchical ( proto-)galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "it also neglects the presence of any stars in protogalaxies , which could contribute both to the feedback driving gaseous outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) _ and _ to the gravity containing them .",
    "( the assumptions of spherical symmetry and a smooth ambient medium are not fatal flaws ; see @xcite ) .    however , it is not our intention here to improve equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) .",
    "rather , we aim primarily to establish a method by which halo properties at @xmath18 in relations _ such as _ equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) can be related to the average properties of stellar spheroids at @xmath0 . by doing this ,",
    "we hope to understand better how expected relationships between smbh masses and protogalactic dark - matter halos are reflected in the observed @xmath15@xmath16 relation particularly . equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) is a good test case because it is simple and transparent but still contains enough relevant feedback physics to be interesting , even with the caveats mentioned above .",
    "it is also the only such relation we know of , which _ does not assume that dark - matter halos are singular isothermal spheres_.      as a point of reference , figure [ fig : simple ] shows smbh mass against the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath34 within an aperture equal to the stellar effective radius , for galaxies and bulges in the compilation of @xcite .",
    "the dashed line shows equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) evaluated with a gas - to - dark matter mass ratio of @xmath29 ( the cosmic average ; @xcite ) for all protogalaxies at the time of blow - out , and with the naive substitution @xmath35 for all spheroids at @xmath0 . the proximity of this line to the data ",
    "first emphasised by @xcite , who assumed isothermal halos  encourages taking seriously the basic physical ideas behind equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) , even though ( as discussed above ) some details must be incorrect at some level",
    ".    however , setting @xmath36 is problematic .",
    "a @xmath37-proportionality between circular speed and velocity dispersion is appropriate only for isothermal spheres , which real dark - matter halos are not .",
    "a dark - matter velocity dispersion can be equated to a stellar velocity dispersion only if the dark matter and the stars have the same spatial distribution , which is not true of real galaxies . and",

    "this is done without any reference to black holes , and the scalings should be of use beyond applications to smbh correlations . in ",
    "[ sec : msigma ] , we make a new , more rigorous comparison of equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) to the smbh @xmath15@xmath16 data ( compare figure [ fig : mbhsigma ] below to figure [ fig : simple ] ) .",
    "our work could in principle be used to explore the consequences of smbh  halo relations like equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) for other smbh  bulge correlations as well , but we do not pursue these here . in  [ sec : summary ] , we summarise the paper .",
    "equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) incorporates an assumption that gas traced the dark matter in _ protogalaxies _ before being blown out by quasar - mode accretion feedback at high redshift .",
    "however , it does not make any assumptions about the detailed structure of dark - matter halos at any epoch , and it neither requires nor implies that mass follows light in galaxies at @xmath0 .    in this section , we collect together analytical expressions from the literature for the ( different ) stellar and dark - matter mass profiles in galaxies , and for some key structural parameters of dark matter halos and their evolution in @xmath8cdm simulations of structure formation .",
    "we use these to obtain our new results in  [ sec : modresults ] and  [ sec : msigma ] .",
    "some of these expressions from the literature , and all of the scaling relations we ultimately derive , represent average trends that can have significant scatter around them .",
    "we do not attempt in this paper to analyse such scatter or to predict the net scatter around any scaling that comes from combining others .",
    "this section and  [ sec : modresults ] do not rely on any ideas about black hole accretion feedback or smbh  bulge correlations .",
    "we focus repeatedly on the peak circular speed @xmath23 in dark - matter halos , because that is what appears in equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) for @xmath11 ; but we do not actually use the equation until  [ sec : msigma ] .",
    "we use the spherical density profile of @xcite to describe the stars in early - type galaxies at @xmath0 . the density in this model",

    "thus , it adequately represents the typical light distributions in spheroids of mass @xmath43@xmath44 , which more generally follow @xcite profiles@xmath45$]with indices @xmath467 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "these stellar masses correspond to velocity dispersions @xmath47@xmath48 ( see figure [ fig : allplots ] ) , which is the range spanned by the local galaxies that define the black hole @xmath15@xmath16 relation in figure  [ fig : simple ] .",
    "the fine details of the assumed stellar density or mass profile matter most in our calculations of dimensionless stellar velocity dispersions @xmath49 using the jeans equation with model dark matter halos included ( see  [ subsec : apdisp ] below ) .",
    "secondarily , the exact shape of @xmath50 affects the mass ratio @xmath51 , which we discuss in  [ subsec : fe ] .",
    "we examine closely in  [ sec : modresults ] the consequences of using @xcite profiles for all galaxies in our calculations . in general",
    ", it exposes us to possible errors at the @xmath52 level or less .      since the dark - matter circular speed @xmath23 enters equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) through a high power , it is important that we have a good idea of how sensitive our results may be to the details of the dark - matter density profile that we assume .",

    "this is due to the way that dark - matter halo masses grow and circular speeds increase through hierarchical merging in a @xmath8cdm cosmology after @xmath11 is set by feedback and the halo properties at @xmath276 ( see figure [ fig : vpkz ] ) .",
    "however , the values we calculate for @xmath11 include only the growth by accretion up to @xmath341 ; further growth through smbh  smbh coalescences in gas - poor mergers at lower redshifts is neglected .",

    "[ subsec : msigma ] , simulations by @xcite suggest that low - redshift merging has a significant effect on the smbh masses in systems with large @xmath342@xmath48 at @xmath0 . there , dry mergers can scatter @xmath11 values strongly upwards from the values at @xmath276 , essentially erasing the flattening that might otherwise be observed at @xmath0 and `` saturating '' the empirical @xmath15@xmath16 relation . in galaxies with lower @xmath343",
    ", where most current data fall , such scatter up from feedback - limited smbh masses will be much more modest in general .",
    "the expected @xmath11@xmath34 relations at @xmath0 should then have the same basic shape as when late mergers are ignored .",
    "although we have focussed on the observed @xmath15@xmath16 relation , other smbh  bulge correlations exist that may be just as strong intrinsically .",
    "these include the @xmath344 correlation and multivariate , `` fundamental - plane '' relationships between @xmath11 and non - trivial combinations of @xmath39 , @xmath1 and @xmath34 .",
    "they should also reflect any underlying smbh ",
    "dark matter connection at some @xmath280 , and the techniques of this paper can be applied to look at them as well .",
    "however , this will best be done with close attention also paid to the inevitable scatter around all of the scalings we have adopted for both stellar and dark - matter halo properties .",
    "it remains to be understood how the numerous individual sources of scatter combine to produce smbh correlations with apparently so little net scatter at @xmath0 .",
    "more sophisticated predictions of critical smbh masses for quasar - mode blow - out in terms of protogalactic dark - matter halo properties are required .",
    "the simple relation @xmath297 that we have used makes very specific assumptions about the mechanism ( e.g. , momentum - driven ) and the setting ( spherical protogalaxies with no stars , initially virialised gas , smooth outflows ) of the feedback that establishes it .",
