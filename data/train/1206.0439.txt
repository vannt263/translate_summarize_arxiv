    "@xcite , witten succeeded in defining , on a physical level of rigor , a large class of new 3-manifold and link invariants ( `` jones - witten invariants '' ) by making use of arguments based on the heuristic chern - simons path integral . later , reshetikhin and turaev found a rigorous definition of these jones - witten invariants using the representation theory of quantum groups and suitable surgery operations on the base manifold , cf .",

    "e.g. , @xcite and the introduction in @xcite ) it is desirable to find a rigorous `` path integral definition '' of the jones - witten invariants , i.e. a definition which is obtained by making rigorous sense of witten s path integral expressions , either before or after a suitable gauge fixing has been applied .    since this problem seems to be rather difficult it looks like a good strategy to restrict one s attention first to special base manifolds for which convenient gauge fixing procedures are available .",
    "a particularly promising situation is the case where the base manifold is of the form @xmath1 and where we apply the so - called `` torus gauge fixing '' procedure , which was introduced by blau and thompson in @xcite for the study of chern - simons models on such manifolds .",
    "the results in @xcite , which were obtained by extending and combining the work in @xcite and @xcite , suggest that for such manifolds it should be possible to find a rigorous realization of the heuristic path integral expressions for the wilson loop observables ( wlos ) which appear after torus gauge fixing has been applied , cf .",
