    "the derjaguin - muller - toporov ( dmt ) theory ( derjaguin et al . , 1975 , muller et al . , 1980 , 1983 )",
    ", for the contact of elastic spheres with adhesion , has a long history .",
    "after bradley ( 1932 ) and derjaguin ( 1934 ) obtained the adhesive force between two _ rigid _ spheres , equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the work of adhesion , and @xmath2 is the radius of the sphere , jkr ( johnson kendall and roberts 1971 ) developed a theory for elastic spheres , assuming adhesive forces occur entirely within the contact area , obtaining @xmath3 of the bradley pull - off value , and hence the independence on the elastic modulus raised a long debate about the a comparison of the pull - off prefactor .    as the main attention in the diatribe between jkr and dmt",
    "was limited to the pull - off value , it is often believed that dmt is the limit for tabor parameter ( tabor , 1977)@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the range of attraction of adhesive forces , close to atomic distance , and @xmath6 the plane strain elastic modulus .",
    "also , we have introduced the length @xmath7 as an alternative measure of adhesion , and @xmath8 is the theoretical strength of the material .",
    "now , while it is true that dmt predicts the bradley result for the force at pull - off also for elastic spheres , the dmt theories have been much less compared with exact results , when considering the entire load - displacement curves . in both dmt methods ,",
    "* the attraction forces act exclusively _ outside _ the contact , and * the repulsive forces _ only _ are responsible for deformation .",
    "then , in the dmt `` force method'':-    * the force of adhesion can be simply obtained by integrating , according to derjaguin s approximation , the forces of facing elements outside of the contact , separated by a gap which is given by hertz theory .",
    "we shall concentrate on the latter ( force ) method , which is what is commonly used when dmt approximation is considered in the generalized context of rough contact ( see persson & scaraggi , 2014 ) . in one",
    "looks at the force of adhesion _ not at pull - off , _ it decreases from @xmath0 to @xmath9 , in the `` thermodynamic method '' , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "it turns out that the thermodynamic  method tends to give opposite error with respect to the `` force method '' , and it is also more complicated to use , so it has not received much attention . ] while it increases in the `` force method '' , as shown by ( muller et al . , 1983 ) , and pashley ( 1984 ) .",
    "pashley ( 1984 ) in particular notices that in the force method , the adhesive force should be always larger than @xmath0 , the value obtained for a truncated rigid sphere independently on the contact radius , as the hertzian profile is closer to the flat surface than the rigid spherical profile .",
    "maugis ( 2000 ) , in his maugis - dugdale analysis ( which _ does not _ make the dmt approximations ) called the low @xmath11 end the `` dmt theory '' , which in fact is now the version most commonly associated with dmt , and sometimes called dmt - m . in this version ,",
    "the attractive forces are constant , and equal to the pull - off value , @xmath0 .",
    "this is indeed what comes out from dmt theory , but only in the limit of @xmath12 : therefore , dmt is exact only in this limit case , and for any finite value of @xmath11 , dmt theories give an error which we shall estimate in fact in details in the present paper as a function of the tabor parameter , since the previous estimates of ( muller et al",
    ". , 1983 ) , and pashley ( 1984 ) do not clarify clearly the role of tabor parameter .",
    "greenwood ( 2007 ) also has discussed more details of the dmt theory in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "but we shall not limit ourselves to the spherical contact case , since this case has been given already much attention , and is only one special case .",
    "the dmt approximation is gaining relevance more recently again , in the context of rough contact , where there is a lot of interest in simplifying the problem since the jkr assumption leads to very complicated and hysteretic behaviour , which so far , has not been included in a framework of any theory , despite some attempts ( persson , 2002 , ciavarella , 2015 ) .",
    "moreover , as roughness at the small scales seems to point to low values of tabor parameter , the `` almost rigid '' behaviour has some fundamental interest .",
    "persson & scaraggi ( 2014 ) have indeed attempted using the dmt approximations using the persson s theory for adhesionless contact , and seemed to find some reasonable accuracy at least for the range of parameters they observed .",
    "also , pastewka & robbins ( 2014 , pr in the following ) make some scaling predictions which seem to fit well some limited range of their extensive full numerical simulations involving atomistics rough solids .",
    "we made a first attempt to discuss pr findings in ciavarella ( 2016 ) where we noticed that , if pr were concerned with spherical contact , using the dmt approximation with the additional simplification of using only the asymptotic first term in the expansion of the gap outside the hertzian contacts , they would find easily large errors .",
    "but one limit to this estimate is that we assumed circular contact , whereas pr calculation shows more like 2d fractal contact area , perhaps closer to very elongated contacts like in 2d cylindrical contact  indeed , as we will discuss below , they find a characteristic diameter of the contact independent on load , and load only affects the elongation of the contact area .",
    "therefore , in the present note we develop a simple 2d line contact dmt model , we give more details about the dmt limit for the sphere , and make further comparisons with the dmt rough contact results .",
    "for 2d contact with `` repulsive '' diameter @xmath14 , the full form of the gap outside the contact is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and ( johnson and greenwood , 2008 ) @xmath17   \\right]\\ ] ] whose first term in the series expansion near @xmath18 is @xmath19 , is used in the pr version of dmt method , as commented in ( ciavarella , 2016 ) , and in the later paragraph .",
    "we shall assume for the potential , a maugis simple law .",
    "this will permit a direct comparison with the `` exact '' maugis solution including deformations induced by the adhesive stresses , given by baney and hui ( 1997 ) morrow and lovell ( 2005 ) and johnson and greenwood ( 2008 ) , whereas jin et al .",
    "( 2014 ) give a double hertz solution which show that results will not differ much with those with other choices of potential .",
    "the pull - off force is not a simple multiple of @xmath20 as with circular contacts , but varies from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , so it depends on elastic modulus .",
    "we define the following non - dimensional contact radius and load @xmath23 and accordingly the hertz and jkr limits are found as ( johnson and greenwood , 2008 ) @xmath24 whereas the maugis - dugdale model shows a smooth transition between the hertz and jkr limit  unlike the 3d case , where there is a transition from bradley rigid to jkr model .",
    "notice that the rigid limit is subtle : while there is a tendency to the hertz regime , the actual pull - off in rigid limit is not zero .    moving to a dmt force method estimate , setting the gap to @xmath5 gives @xmath25 and it is clear that the approximation is good until @xmath26 . in dimensionless notation , @xmath27    using the asymptotic term , the lateral distance defining the size of attractive region ( which is composed of two strips of size @xmath28 ) is@xmath29   ^{1/3 } \\label{datt}\\ ] ] and when contact radius is small , we require a correction from the solution of ( [ full - equation ] ) , @xmath30 . as we are using the maugis potential ,",
    "the attractive load is therefore simply the product of the theoretical strength and the area of the adhesive strips , @xmath31 . using ( [ datt ] ) , the attractive load is obtained as@xmath32 using ( [ adim ] , [ pdim ] ) and tabor parameter ( [ tabor]),@xmath33    the results of the dmt theory are presented in fig.1a ( dashed lines ) for @xmath34 , together with the maugis solution of johnson and greenwood ( 2008 ) which we take as reference as `` exact '' . in fig.1b , we compare the jg maugis solution with the further approximation of taking only the first term in the gap profile , which clearly leads to serious errors even at low tabor parameter .",
    "we shall explain why in the pr use of this further approximation , the error was probably balanced by another approximation .",

    "comparison of pull - off values for maugis `` exact '' solution ( solid blue line ) , with the dmt model with full shape of the gap ( dashed line ) .",
    "as this case is classical , dmt has been compared with jkr and other models in a large number of papers .",
    "however , the comparison is mostly done for the value at pull - off , where of course the dmt model gives the correct bradley result for @xmath12 : only perhaps ( muller et al . , 1983 ) , pashley ( 1984 ) , and greenwood ( 2007 ) discuss more details of dmt at compressions larger than zero , and even they",
    ", do not fully clarify the error as a function of tabor parameter .",
    "we shall assume for the potential , a maugis simple law , consistently to the line contact of the previous paragraph .",
    "we have already discussed a further simplified form of this model in ( ciavarella , 2016 ) inspired by pr paper ( pastewka &  robbins , 2014 ) , namely using the first term asymptotic form of the gap function outside of the contact , and of computing the area of attraction by multiplying the perimeter of the contact by a @xmath28 size of attractive region . as we already discussed the very strong effect of both these approximations on the dmt solution",
    ", we shall try here to give a fair assessment of a full  dmt model , and we do not make such further assumptions .    therefore , we introduce the following dimensionless notation for the approach , and the load in spherical contact@xmath40    we know the expression of the gap outside the contact area ( muller et al . , 1983 ) , pashley ( 1984 ) , and greenwood ( 2007 ) @xmath41\\ ] ] imposing the gap is equal to the range of attractive forces , gives the size of attractive region .",
    "writing the size of the region using the first order expansion of the gap is possible in closed form , giving @xmath42 and the correct solution with the full expression of the gap requires a numerical correction for small contact areas , which is @xmath43 .",

    "these simple estimates suggest that the order of error in using the dmt approximation in actually solving rough adhesive contact problems , like done by persson & scaraggi ( 2014 ) for example , could be very large , unless tabor parameter is quite low , and the body very close to `` rigid '' .",
    "incidentally , this means a condition stricter than just tabor parameter lower than , say , 0.2 at the smallest scale in the model , since at the large scale , the contact may result hysteretic , and the dmt model would lead to very large errors",
    ". this may be in practice a very strong condition and would therefore limit significantly the use of such methodology . in the particular case ,",
    "the persson - scaraggi method , which relies on use of additional approximations in solving the adhesiveless contact and integrating for the adhesive force , does nt lead to simple analytical results so it is also important to check , in the end , if there is a significant advantage with respect to a full numerical solution of the problem , like done by pastewka and robbins ( 2014 ) .",
    "speaking of pr , they interpreted their `` exact '' results with some very simple estimates based on dmt approximation , and further simplifications .",
    "one may wonder why pr obtained a reasonable fit of their data , with assuming first order expansion of the gap function , which for example would lead to completely wrong results for very small contact area ( see fig.1b ) .",
    "in particular , this is surprising since their tabor parameter are said to be of the order of 1 , and therefore not very small .",
    "pr , in trying to find some scaling equations , suggested to use a dmt - like force method calculation of the attractive force during the loading stage of what they call `` non - sticky '' cases , based on an asymptotic first term for of the gap , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is _ not _ the slope at the contact edge obviously equal to @xmath54 , as in a standard hertzian contact , _ but a slope value _ they say estimated from the random roughness , and so anyway it is a fixed geometric quantity .",
    "this apparently innocuous assumption hides a very important effect : while taking the first order in the gap leads to very large error ( see fig.1b ) at small areas , here pr take a representative value which can only permit to fit results of their cases  as they have @xmath55 or @xmath56 this corresponds to a dmt model at @xmath57 respectively .",
    "if they had much smaller @xmath53 or much higher ( as indeed it is very possible ) , then we would not know the order of the error .",
    "therefore , we suspect that it is a pure coincidence that they were able to make reasonable fits .    however",
    ", since the rough contact is such that they find ( numerically ) an average representative diameter of the elongated areas of contact of @xmath58 where @xmath59 are rms slopes and curvatures , and we used @xmath60 .",
    "hence , @xmath61 , and it is not just an estimate that pr do when exchanging @xmath53 with @xmath54 in ( [ pr - lateral ] ) , but a quite correct substitution .",
    "their contacts have elongated shapes whose representative size is of the order of the smallest wavelength .",
    "indeed , we can estimate from random process theory that @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the smallest wavelength of roughness , @xmath64 is the hurst exponent , and @xmath65,@xmath66 , respectively for @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , geometry fixes @xmath46 independently on load , and also the gap function is therefore only dependent on geometry .    if the contact areas were circular , applying hertz theory would result in a constant compression @xmath68 , or else@xmath69    in their simplified dmt calculation using first order term for the gap we  estimated ( ciavarella , 2016)@xmath70 finally , as @xmath71 , for their case of the attractive potential @xmath72  ( @xmath73 is atomic distance ) , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 which is clearly up to 2 or 3 times higher than the value expected by the maugis limit for @xmath12 ( maugis , 2000 )  which in turn means the error is probably much larger than 2 or 3 .",
    "in other words , this suggests their contacts _ can not be circular_.    it remains to see therefore an estimate of a line contact geometry .",
    "then , from our dmt estimate with @xmath76 ( only first term in the gap function)@xmath77    however , the dimensionless contact areas ( [ adim ] ) is , using again ( [ drep ] ) , tabor parameter ( [ tabor ] ) , and @xmath60@xmath78 and hence , the pr - dmt 2d model becomes independent on tabor , but only on slope@xmath79 which clearly becomes arbitrarily large at small slopes .",
    "the real total load curves for pr are therefore ( from their potential , we find @xmath80 for@xmath81 ) @xmath82 we estimate the tabor parameter at small scale for the pr data is about 0.4 - 0.5 for @xmath83 , and about 1 for @xmath84 , when @xmath55 . for @xmath85 values",
    "are smaller by a factor close to 2 ( 0.27 and 0.67 ) .",
    "this is for @xmath86 whereas for @xmath87 , they are slightly larger . however ,",
    "notice that the dmt - pr estimate does not depend on @xmath88 wavelength , whereas the maugis solution does , and therefore this trend is not captured with the simple dmt estimate .",
    "therefore , for @xmath86 we report in fig.5a the case @xmath89together with maugis with @xmath90 , whereas in fig.5b ,  the case @xmath91together with maugis with @xmath92 it is clear that the agreement is reasonable and may explain the fit done by pr .",
    "in particular , the lower tabor parameter seem to be better fitted by the simple dmt - pr law . in the pr results , these are the low @xmath88 which are the stickiest cases . for the high @xmath88 , we expect that dmt - pr underestimates the force of attraction , and therefore surfaces are stickier than the pr criterion would suggest .",
    "this seems in agreement with the pr findings for pull - off , which do not fit their stickiness criterion ( see ciavarella , 2016 ) .",
    "however , more investigation is needed to understand within which limit one can use this approximation for rough contacts . for very small slopes , pr - dmt would tend to extremely large attractive forces without limit , whereas when the tabor parameter increases to values larger than 5 , the correct adhesion solution becomes jkr and does nt show an unbounded attractive force .",

    "we have examined in details the effect of the dmt approximations ( `` force method '' )  in the case of a spherical and line contact , and we have shown that :    * for spherical contact , dmt leads to an error overestimating the attractive forces , which is very significant already at very low tabor parameters , such as @xmath95 but becomes extremely large at tabor of the order of 1  much larger than the error for the pull - off value , which occurs for a wrong value of separation ; * for line contact , dmt leads to a different error : the attractive force tends to be underestimated , except near pull - off , where now the error can be very significant at @xmath96 * it could be that for elongated contacts , like those found in rough contact , the error could be intermediate between these two extreme conditions , * in general , it is highly unlikely that dmt can be a good approximation for values of tabor parameter greater than , say , 0.25 . * in rough contacts , due to special features of the contact area ( far from set of spherical asperities like in the classical fuller - tabor ( 1975 ) model based on nayak ( 1971 ) geometries ) , the contact appears a set of elongated contacts , whose representative diameter is relatively independent on load  but this is probably only true during loading . * the use of only asymptotic term of the gap function leads to serious errors , however when adding the further crude approximation made by pastewka &  robbins that the slope at the contact edge was given by geometrical considerations only , it leads to some more reasonable behaviour .",
    "however , quantitatively the fit they may have obtained is only a pure coincidence * the scaling equations obtained from dmt type of model by pastewka and robbins should not be used outside their range of parameters , as extrapolation is not likely to work .",
    "in particular , for very small rms slopes of surface , the limit results do not seem realistic .",
