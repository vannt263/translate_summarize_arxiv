    "in the last decade the connection between cosmology and particle physics has become more and more interesting .",
    "we have several sectors in which a comparison between the theoretical high energy physics processes of the very early universe and their observable traces is possible .",
    "these research frontiers include the exploration of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and of the large scale structure in the present matter distribution ( lss ) ; wide and high resolution experiments designed to gain observationally insight into these topics are currently in preparation @xcite .",
    "let us approach the subject of this work .",
    "very recently the emissions from deep type ia supernova have become observable with unprecedented high resolution @xcite .",
    "the surprising news arising from these observations suggest that we are currently living in a universe that is _ accelerating _ its expansion .",
    "as it is well known , this could be the observable effect of a vacuum energy density comparable with the critical one . a possible explanation could be the existence of a cosmological constant , much smaller than the characteristic energy scales of quantum gravity effects but non - zero .",
    "this _ ad  hoc _ possibility is unlikely for theorists , tending to believe that some unknown process set the cosmological constant to zero in the very early universe @xcite .",
    "recently the idea that the vacuum energy density could be mimicked by a dynamical scalar field @xmath0 , named quintessence , has been considered with more and more interest since it provide several nice features in the cmb power spectrum and lss .",
    "more precisely , this occurs in the two most popular candidates proposed so far for this field , a cosine potential for the pseudo nambu goldstone boson @xcite and an exponential potential @xcite .",
    "however , since most of the inflationary phenomenology is based on the dynamics of a scalar field , the inflaton , it is tempting to relate quintessence to inflaton .",
    "a first proposal from the scientific community in this sense was made very recently @xcite .",
    "the authors suggested that quintessence and inflaton are the same field seen at different times .",
    "they proposed a detailed model , providing an appropriate set of values for the physical constants in order to realize this fascinating possibility .",
    "the key feature is the occurring of a kinetic energy dominated phase that connects inflation and radiation era .",
    "although the model has to be further investigated , especially for what concerns the spectrum of gravitational waves and the possible production of topological defects , it is interesting to look at the perturbations dynamics induced by its basic features . a quintessence model with similar characteristics is being considered by other authors @xcite , with emphasis on arguments regarding the viability of general quintessence models . in this work",
    "we concentrate on the power spectra of cmb polarization and temperature anisotropies as well as on the lss perturbations produced in this scenario . in section",
    "ii we recall the background dynamics in quintessential inflation and in section iii we describe its perturbations ; finally , in section iv we numerically compute and discuss the signature of this scenario on the cmb polarization and temperature power spectra and on the lss .",
    "in this section we briefly review the basic features of quintessential inflation ; the reader is advised to look at the original work in @xcite for a complete exposition and references .",
    "the model involves a minimally coupled scalar field with potential @xmath1 @xmath2 inflation occurs for @xmath3 ; radiation and matter dominated eras for @xmath4 . in order to make particles and perturbations production just as in chaotic inflationary models @xcite , and to have about @xmath5 of the critical energy today in quintessence , the following physical constants , in @xmath6 units ,",
    "have been chosen : @xmath7 the cosmic trajectory is assumed to begin at @xmath8 , with an era of chaotic inflation . at @xmath9 a kinetic energy",
    "dominated era begins ; in this epoch the ( kinetic ) quintessence energy density decreases very rapidly , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the scale factor . as in the ordinary scenario ,",
    "particles are produced in the curved space - time from an initial quantum vacuum state @xcite . in order to have a workable model ,",
    "it is necessary that the kinetic era ends when the total field energy is negligible with respect to the radiation one ; if this is the case , the radiation era begins and @xmath0 starts its slow rolling toward the present state .",
    "it is interesting to note that this model gives a reheating temperature curiously comparable with the supposed electroweak symmetry breaking scale , @xmath12gev , where @xmath13 is the number of scalar fields involved in the process .",
    "this is the general phenomenology imposed by the constants ( [ pc ] ) . at the present time , in the matter dominated era , the inflaton is totally equivalent to a quintessence field , rolling on the potential @xmath14 with a simple time evolution , @xmath15 .",
    "perturbations in models with a dynamical scalar field together with the other ordinary matter and radiation particles require a generalization @xcite of earlier works @xcite ; a complete treatment of this subject can be found in the cited works and here we report only the relevant issues for the present problem .    even if the reheating temperature in the present scenario is much smaller than in chaotic inflation , radiation dominates well before nucleosynthesis . in the most simple view , the cosmic fluid can be thought composed by photons ( @xmath16 ) , baryons ( @xmath17 ) , cold dark matter ( @xmath18 ) and three families of massless neutrinos ( @xmath19 ) . as we briefly exposed in the previous section ,",
    "gaussian perturbations arise adiabatically from the inflaton dynamics at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "they involve matter and radiation as well as fluctuations @xmath20 of the scalar field around its background value @xmath0 .",
    "the initial conditions for the perturbations are posed at early conformal time @xmath21 when essentially all the perturbation wavenumber @xmath22 interesting for structure formation are well outside the effective horizon , @xmath23 .",
    "adiabatic conditions are posed initially by requiring that no gauge invariant entropy perturbation difference exists between any pair of components @xcite ; in the conformal newtonian gauge , the leading order early time behaviour for the scalar quantities evolving from adiabatic initial conditions is @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 means density , velocity and shear perturbations respectively .",
    "note that @xmath20 is initially linked to the kinetic field energy .",
    "a multipole expansion accounts for temperature as well as polarization perturbations of the planckian black body spectrum arising mainly from thomson scattering at the energies relevant in the present problem ; neutrinos also are treated similarly without the thomson scattering terms @xcite .    from this initial regime , perturbations evolve according the linearized einstein and boltzmann equations in a flat friedmann robertson walker background ; the latter involves quintessence , scale factor and unperturbed density of all the fluid species , being driven by the klein gordon and unperturbed einstein equations respectively ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we require that at the present about @xmath5 of the critical energy density resides in quintessence .",
    "this energy comes essentially from the potential component , since @xmath0 is rolling very slowly making the kinetic energy negligible , as we show below ; the baryon abundance respects the nucleosynthesis constraint : @xmath28 also we adopt @xmath29 km / s / mpc consistently with some present measurements @xcite and assume an initial power spectrum exactly scale - invariant .    the request that the present amount of quintessence energy is @xmath30 does not fix completely its dynamics ; since it obeys the klein gordon equation we need to specify its time derivative . at the present",
    "this is very low since it has been redshifted away during the expansion occurred in the radiation and matter eras ( assuming that it is not too large with respect to the potential energy at the beginning of the radiation dominated era ) .",
    "however , particularly in this scenario where the kinetic energy plays a fundamental role during the cosmic evolution , it is important to take into account the field time derivative .",
    "this is realized in the following way : after fixing @xmath30 , the code asks for the initial kinetic to potential energy ratio ; the sign of the time derivative is then chosen toward the direction of lower potential of course , that is @xmath31 in this case .",
    "in all the cases analyzed @xmath0 has initially an equal amount of kinetic and potential energy .",
    "we examine the imprint on the main observational topics for this scenario .",
    "we show our results regarding cmb polarization , temperature and linear matter power spectrum in figures 1,2,3 respectively . in these figures ,",
    "solid curves having increasing amplitudes describe quintessence models having increasing values of @xmath30 .",
    "polarization anisotropies in the cmb has not yet measured ; the existing upper limits are at the level of the measured temperature anisotropies , see @xcite and references therein for further details . on the other hand",
    "it is expected to arise naturally as the result of the anisotropic nature of the thomson scattering ; thus polarization anisotropies arises mainly from the cmb acoustic oscillations occurring on sub - horizon scale at decoupling , that is a degree in the sky or less .",
    "figure 1 shows the power spectra of the polarization anisotropies in quintessential inflation ( solid line ) .",
    "the thin dashed line represents an ordinary cold dark matter model ( cdm ) in which the energy density associated with quintessence has been replaced with dark matter .",
    "the amplitude of the peaks increases and there is a global shift toward higher multipole indexes , or smaller scales .",
    "the first effect is due to the lack of matter at decoupling with respect to the cdm model : the universe at decoupling is mildly radiation dominated and this enhances the radiation perturbation amplitude ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the second is a projection effect resulting from a pure geometric feature @xcite ; the comoving distance of the last scattering surface in quintessence models is larger than in cdm , thus shifting the angular scales corresponding to the coherent acoustic oscillations toward smaller angular scales .",
    "the same features occur in the cobe normalized cmb temperature power spectra shown in figure 2 . in this case",
    "a third effect arises from the integrated sachs - wolfe effect due to the time evolution of matter perturbations along the photons path .",
    "again this is due to the lack of matter in quintessence model with respect to the cdm . also this is effective mainly on super - horizon scales , low multipoles in the figure , that prevent the cancelation from the oscillatory sub - horizon dynamics .",
    "we used linear perturbation theory to calculate the matter power spectra @xmath32 plotted in figure 3 .",
    "they are defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the dirac delta function and @xmath35 is the fourier transform of the spatial matter density fluctuation field .",
    "the epoch of matter - radiation equality in quintessence scenarios is obviously closer to the present than in cdm models , because of the lack of matter .",
    "the effective horizon scale at equivalence corresponds roughly to the location of the turnover in the spectra ; this causes the shift toward larger scales , or small wavenumbers , and therefore subtracts power to the small scale structure as indicated by the current data from galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "+ the dispersion of the density field is quantified by values of @xmath36 for @xmath37 , @xmath38 for @xmath39 , @xmath40 for @xmath41 , which are to be compared with standard cdm ( @xmath42 ) model prediction of @xmath43 .    before concluding , it is necessary to point out here that most of the dynamics of background and perturbations regards the @xmath44 side of the potential ( [ pvp ] ) . in other words , in the present analysis the distinctive features on cmb and lss come from the form of the potential in the radiation and matter dominated eras and from the assumption of initial adiabaticity .",
    "if the future observed spectra should be in agreement with the ones computed here , we shall be able to state that the observed cosmology is consistent with quintessential inflation , without confirming it definitely .",
    "surely this model has to be further investigated , and hopefully its predictions will be enriched by a more deep understanding of its phenomenology at the transition between inflation and radiation era ; ultimately this scenario will be further constrained by experimental enterprises of the next generation , beginning from the primordial gravitational waves spectrum .",
