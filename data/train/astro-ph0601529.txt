    "development of a complete theory of star formation requires understanding the physical conditions of the molecular gas in which stars form , both on sub - parsec and multi - parsec scales . on the latter size scales , observations of molecular clouds",

    "this is because the purely rotational transitions are quadrupolar and only occur between widely spaced ( @xmath11 ) levels .",
    "consequently , estimating the properties of the bulk of the molecular gas , which is cold ( kinetic temperatures of @xmath1220@xmath4k , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requires observing lines of trace molecules with dipole transitions and closely spaced levels .",
    "the molecule co and its isotopologues , like @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are the usual molecules of choice for estimating the large - scale properties of molecular clouds , because the most common isotopologue of co  @xmath13  is the most abundant molecule after @xmath9 , the levels are closely spaced ( @xmath14 for @xmath15 of @xmath13 ) , and the critical density of the lowest transition is low ( i.e. @xmath16 for @xmath15 ) .",
    "these characteristics of co ensure that the lines are often strong  with radiation temperatures or @xmath17 ( i.e. , rayleigh - jeans brightness temperatures as opposed to planck brightness temperatures ) of a few kelvins  for @xmath18 observations of clouds in our galaxy , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the lower - j lines of @xmath20 are often optically thick and can not probe deeply into the substructures , such as clumps or filaments , of molecular clouds .",
    "also , the opacity of the @xmath20 lines reduces their sensitivity to the effects of changing density and changing radiative trapping .",

    "of particular interest is locating regions of warm ( e.g. , @xmath23@xmath24 ) molecular gas , because energetic events and massive stars associated with recent star formation heat the surrounding molecular gas .",

    "examples of how two of the line ratios involving the three lowest rotational lines of co vary with gas kinetic temperature , @xmath25 , in local thermodynamic equilibrium or lte are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "all the curves in figure  [ fig1 ] show the same trend : the line ratios lose their sensitivity to @xmath25 in the high-@xmath25 , or rayleigh - jeans , limit .",
    "this is a consequence of the line ratios depending on ratios of two planck functions at different frequencies .",
    "the maximum @xmath25 to which a given line ratio is sensitive can be quantified by adopting a calibration uncertainty for the line ratios .",
    "if we adopt the optimistic value of 20% for the uncertainties in the ratios , then a ratio that has an observed value @xmath26 of its asymptotic value in the rayleigh - jeans limit is observationally indistinguishable from this asymptotic value .",
    "similarly , the value of the kinetic temperature at this 80% level is the maximum kinetic temperature for which the given ratio is sensitive .",
    "two important conclusions can be drawn from the plots of figure  [ fig1 ] :    1 .   optically thin lines , like those of @xmath0 , have a greater range of sensitivity to @xmath25 than do optically thick lines , like those of @xmath20 .",
    "specifically , @xmath27 loses @xmath25 sensitivity above 46@xmath4k in the optically thin case and above 10@xmath4k in the optically thick case .",
    "2 .   ratios involving higher - j lines have a greater range of temperature sensitivity than those with lower - j lines . for @xmath28",
    "the maximum @xmath25 values are 73@xmath4k and 13@xmath4k for the optically thin and thick cases respectively .",
    "these values are higher than the corresponding values for the @xmath27 ratio , especially for the optically thin case .",
    "it is clear then that unambiguous identification of warm molecular gas requires observations of high - j lines of @xmath20 and , sometimes , the optically thin lines of @xmath0 ( see references cited at the end of the previous paragraph ) .",
    "( it should be mentioned that simply observing the optically thick lines of @xmath20 does not automatically give the kinetic temperature , because the observed lines are not necessarily thermalized and the gas does not necessarily fill the beam in the velocity interval about the line peak . )    however , identifying warm gas in this manner can be complicated .",
    "one complication is that observing higher and higher lines up the rotational ladder becomes increasingly difficult with ground - based observations , because the atmosphere becomes increasingly opaque , on average , and because sub - millimeter receivers become increasingly noisier with decreasing observational wavelength .",
    "another complication is that non - lte effects become more important higher in the rotational ladder : distinguishing between the density effects on the line ratios and kinetic temperature effects becomes difficult .",
    "one way to separate such effects is to observe many co rotational lines , but this can be observationally intensive  especially if high - j @xmath0 lines are also observed .",
    "another approach to finding warm gas is using the @xmath29 intensity ratio .",
    "this ratio is very sensitive to the molecular gas kinetic temperature in the lte , high-@xmath25 limit .",
    "for example , the @xmath30 intensity ratio in lte goes like @xmath31 to within 25% for @xmath32 .",
    "while the advantage of this ratio is that it only requires two lines with very similar frequencies , the considerable disadvantage is that the @xmath20 and @xmath0 lines occur in very different optical depth regimes .",
    "this results in three problems .",
    "one is that the @xmath20 line will be effectively probing a different volume of gas from that of the @xmath0 line .",
    "another is that the levels of radiative trapping will be very different between the @xmath20 and @xmath0 lines , resulting in some sensitivity to density for the @xmath29 intensity ratio .",
    "the third problem caused by the very different opacities in the @xmath20 and @xmath0 lines is that the @xmath29 intensity ratio will have some dependence on gas column density ; indeed , in lte this ratio is the inverse of the optical depth of the @xmath0 line ( for the @xmath20 line in the optically thick limit and @xmath0 in the optically thin limit ) .",
    "while the problems above are not necessarily prohibitively difficult , it would be helpful nonetheless to have two optically thin tracers with very different dependences on temperature , with relative insensitivity to gas density , and that are ubiquitous in the molecular ism .",
    "the use of such tracers would complement the use of lines of co and of other molecules in diagnosing the presence of warm molecular gas simply and unambiguously .    another way to trace molecular gas , and interstellar gas in general ,",
    "is to observe the continuum emission from the dust grains found throughout most of the ism .",
    "this continuum emission is usually observed at mid - ir , far - ir , submillimeter , and millimeter wavelengths .",
    "on parsec scales , dust continuum emission is usually optically thin for wavelengths @xmath33 .",
    "all - sky surveys like iras and _ cobe_/_dirbe _ cover specific ir wavelengths from the mid - ir to far - ir and near - ir to far - ir , respectively @xcite .",
    "surveys at such wavelengths in the continuum are valuable for probing the structure and excitation of the ism ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    ". ratios of continuum intensities at different wavelengths , for instance , can constrain estimates of dust grain temperatures . a physical model that includes dust - gas thermal coupling",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optically thin dust continuum intensity is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the optical depth at frequency @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the planck function evaluated at frequency @xmath36 and dust temperature , @xmath38 . in the far - infrared , the optical depth is often approximated as a power - law @xmath39 , where the emissivity index @xmath40 depends on the size and optical properties of the grains .",
    "consequently , as with co rotational lines , the ratio of continuum intensities at different wavelengths loses sensitivity to dust temperature in the rayleigh - jeans limit . as an example",
    ", we will consider the ratio of continuum intensities ( per unit frequency ) at the wavelength of 450@xmath3 to that at 850@xmath3 , i.e. @xmath41 , and adopt a 20% calibration uncertainty for this ratio .",
    "we will also adopt @xmath42 , which is a reasonable number for wavelengths longer than about 100@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these adopted values imply that the @xmath41 ratio loses sensitivity to dust temperature for @xmath43 ( again from adopting 80% of the asymptotic value in the rayleigh - jeans limit ) .",
    "this maximum @xmath38 can be improved by roughly a factor of 2 by combining the 450@xmath3 observations with observations at wavelengths longer than 850@xmath3 , but real improvement over this 37@xmath4k limit requires observations at wavelengths even shorter than 450@xmath3 .",
    "observations at such short wavelengths must deal with increased atmospheric opacity and sometimes must be space - based ( e.g. , iras and _ cobe _ ) .",
    "a more direct ground - based approach is suggested by the work of @xcite , who show that a direct comparison of optically thin co line emission with submillimeter continuum can provide temperature estimates of the dust and molecular gas in molecular clouds ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite derive an expression for the millimeter continuum to integrated @xmath44 line strength ratio , @xmath45 , which goes like @xmath46 in the high - temperature limit in lte . for similar gas and dust temperatures",
    ", this means that the @xmath45 ratio and , similarly , the @xmath47 ratio are actually _ more sensitive to temperature as that temperature increases .",
    "_ this is in stark contrast to ratios of rotational lines of a given isotopologue of co and to ratios of continuum intensities at different frequencies , which , as discussed above , _ lose _ sensitivity to temperature in the high - temperature limit .",
    "in addition , comparing the continuum intensity with that of a low - j line like the @xmath15 line of @xmath0 ( or of @xmath1 ) reduces the sensitivity of the continuum - to - line ratio to gas density . in short",
    ", the intensity ratio of the submillimeter continuum to an optically thin co line may be the sought - for alternative diagnostic of molecular gas temperature that was mentioned above .    despite the potential diagnostic advantages of the continuum - to - line ratio , interpretation of this ratio and its spatial variations",
    "assumes the following :    * _ the ratio of the mass of @xmath0 to that of dust does not vary spatially .",
    "_ even though the gas - to - dust mass ratio may vary , the @xmath0-to - dust mass ratio may not vary significantly within a single source , but may vary by up to an order of magnitude from source to source @xcite . *",
    "_ the gas along a given line of sight is predominantly molecular .",
    "_ appreciable quantities of atomic or ionized gas and their associated dust would complicate the interpretation of @xmath47 .",
    "this is because the submillimeter continuum emission would _ not _ originate in dust _ only _ associated with molecular gas , but the @xmath0 emission _ would _ originate only from the molecular gas . consulting h@xmath4i",
    "21-cm and radio continuum data can check this assumption . *",
    "_ the molecular gas density does not vary spatially . _",
    "if this assumption is false , then spatial gradients in the @xmath47 ratio may be probing spatial gradients in the molecular gas density rather than in the molecular gas temperature .",
    "again , observing the lower - j rotational lines of @xmath0 , especially the @xmath15 , line can minimize this problem . *",
    "_ the gas and dust temperatures have spatial gradients in the same direction .",
    "_ even if @xmath48 , only assuming that the spatial gradients are in the same direction for both @xmath25 and @xmath38 is necessary .",
    "this is reasonable since both gas and dust are cooler with greater distance from heating sources , especially on multi - parsec scales . *",
    "_ dust grain properties , like the dust mass absorption coefficient ( @xmath49 ) and emissivity index ( @xmath40 ) , do not vary spatially .",
    "_ observations of orion , for example , show that such variations do occur for @xmath40 on sub - parsec scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but , to first order , adopting a single value on multi - parsec scales is possible . * _ the @xmath0 line used in the comparison is truly optically thin . _",
    "if the @xmath0 line opacity varies from optically thin to optically thick , the @xmath50 ratio would again show gradients .",
    "the cause of the opacity change could still be due to a change in temperature , but it could also be due to a change in column density ( and even volume density ) . observing the corresponding @xmath1 line can test this . *",
    "_ there is no temperature gradient along the line of sight .",
    "_ such a gradient would result in the submillimeter emission being biased toward the warmer regions along the line of sight and the @xmath0 emission much less so biased ( and even biased toward the colder regions if lte applies ) . even in the hypothetical case of @xmath51 at every point along the line of sight",
    ", these biases could lead the observer , armed with observations at additional frequencies , to believe that @xmath48 .",
    "this could also lead to the erroneous result that comparisons from one line of sight to another show no coupling between gas and dust temperatures .",
    "the effects of gradients along the line of sight can be minimized by observing clouds on multi - parsec scales , where such gradients would be less extreme .",
    "* _ thermal and non - thermal gas emission make a negligible contribution to the submillimeter continuum_. this should indeed be the case . in m@xmath482 , for example , @xcite estimate that @xmath52 of the 1300@xmath3 flux in the central 30 - 45@xmath53 is due to gas emission",
    ". this would be even less at shorter wavelengths and in regions with no dominant supernova remnants nor hii regions",
    ".    these assumptions may be reasonable first approximations for observations on multi - parsec scales or , depending on the assumption , can be tested for each source observed .",
    "testing the overall validity of the above assumptions and , as a result , the behavior and effectiveness of the @xmath50 ratio as a diagnostic of molecular cloud physical conditions requires maps of a molecular cloud in the submillimeter or far - infrared ( fir ) continuum , in the @xmath2 or @xmath54 spectral lines , and of dust or gas temperatures , all with resolutions at multi - parsec scales .",
    "the most reliable maps of temperatures associated with molecular clouds would be from ratios of fir maps .",
    "ignoring certain complications for the moment , such as line - of - sight gradients in dust properties ( e.g. , @xmath38 ) , uncertainties in those properties ( e.g. , @xmath40 ) , and dust grains _ not _ in thermal equilibrium , the ratio of the intensities of fir maps at two different wavelengths gives reliable dust temperatures because such intensities are in the wien limit of the planck function . in this limit , the dust temperature derived from the observed intensity ratio is insensitive to that ratio .",
    "for example , the observed continuum intensity ratio of @xmath55 would imply @xmath56 .",
    "a 10% uncertainty in that intensity ratio would imply only a 5% uncertainty in the derived dust temperature ( or @xmath57 ) .",
    "one complication , that of stochastically - heated dust grains ( i.e. , grains _ not _ in thermal equilibrium ) , can be effectively avoided by using two fir maps at wavelengths of @xmath58 ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this , therefore , rules out using iras maps , whose nomimal wavelengths do not go beyond 100@xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , maps from the _ dirbe _ instrument aboard the _ cobe _ spacecraft cover the whole sky in ten ir bands from 1.25@xmath3 out to 240@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "two maps are at nominal wavelengths of longer than 100@xmath3 ( i.e. , 140@xmath3 and 240@xmath3 ) , making them virtually free of emission from stochastically - heated grains .",
    "thus the _ dirbe _ maps at 140@xmath3 and 240@xmath3 and their ratio can be compared with a map of @xmath2 ( or @xmath54 if available ) of a given molecular cloud .",
    "maps of entire clouds in our galaxy in @xmath2 have recently become available .",
    "therefore , the observational data exist to test the sensitivity and reliability to molecular cloud physical conditions of the ratio of the submillimeter or fir continuum to @xmath0 line intensities .",
    "the appropriate molecular cloud , or cloud_s _ , for which this testing should be applied must satisfy a number of criteria :    * the test clouds should be bright in the desired tracers ( i.e. , fir and @xmath0 ) and completely or nearly completely mapped in these tracers , * largely mapped in tracers of atomic and ionized gas , such as hi 21-cm and radio continuum , * out of the galactic plane to reduce confusion with foreground and background material , * several degrees in extent so as to accommodate many beams of the large _ dirbe _ beam ( @xmath59 ) , * and should have as large a range of dust temperatures as possible at the _ dirbe _ resolution .",

    "* ) , the orion clouds have the largest range of dust temperatures at the _ dirbe _ resolution ( see figure  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the orion@xmath4a and b molecular clouds are bright in @xmath2 @xcite , and in the fir continuum at 140@xmath3 and 240@xmath3 @xcite , and has been completely or largely mapped in these tracers .",
    "much of the orion constellation has been mapped in h@xmath4i @xcite and radio continuum @xcite , thereby permitting tests of whether or not molecular gas dominates the cloud surface , or column , density for each line of sight .",
    "much of orion has also been mapped in @xmath20 lines @xcite , which can also provide crude estimates of the molecular gas column densities .",
    "note that only @xcite have mapped the orion all three major clouds : orion@xmath4a , orion@xmath4b and the @xmath60orionis ring .",
    "the orion clouds are about 15 - 20@xmath61 out of the galactic plane and about @xmath62 ( or about @xmath63 for an adopted distance of 450@xmath4pc ) in size , down to some ill - defined zero level .",
    "an additional advantage to the clouds of orion is that these clouds have been surveyed at many other wavelengths on the scales of many parsecs , thereby providing further checks on models .",
    "these other wavelengths include , for example , the optical surveys of the orion ob1 and @xmath60ori ob associations @xcite , the near - ir to far - ir all - sky survey of",

    "therefore , the orion@xmath4a and b molecular clouds were chosen for testing the behavior of the @xmath50 ratio , using the _ dirbe _ maps at 140@xmath3 and 240@xmath3 and the @xmath2 data of @xcite .",
    "in addition to testing the diagnostic abilities of the continuum - to - line ratio , the current data may also permit us to test theoretical models describing interactions between dust and gas .",
    "specifically , models of dust - gas thermal coupling use very simple assumptions , such as large , single - size , spherical dust grains with smooth surfaces ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "much in this section has been discussed in @xcite ( hereafter referred to as w96 ) in section  2.1 of that paper .",
    "the data in the current paper are from the 1998 release , whereas the data of w96 were of the 1993 release .",
    "also , the current paper concentrates on bands 9 ( i.e. @xmath64 ) and 10 ( @xmath65 ) , while w96 discussed all 10 wavelength bands .",
    "consequently , the data processing in this section largely concerns the maps in the 140@xmath3 and 240@xmath3 bands from the 1998-release of the _ dirbe _ data .    while a number of _ dirbe _ data products are available , the zsma ( zodi - subtracted mission averaged ) maps were the most relevant for the current research .",
    "( see the * ? ? ? * for more details of the _ dirbe _ data products described in this paragraph . )",
    "these maps are the average sky brightnesses determined from averaging over the full 40 weeks of the _ cobe _ mission , thereby maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio of the data .",
    "maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio is particularly important for the 140@xmath3 and 240@xmath3 bands , because these have the noisiest data .",
    "the average sky brightness in each wavelength band was determined after removal of the _ dirbe _ interplanetary dust model for each of the ten wavelength bands , which effectively removes the zodiacal emission from the maps .",
    "the zsma maps are available in the form of fits tables that include the pixel number , the intensity in that pixel in mjy / sr , and the noise in that pixel in mjy / sr .",
    "the fits tables were converted into maps in the equal - area mollweide projection using idl routines available from nasa / gsfc through the worldwide web .",
    "the fxbopen and fxbread routines were used to open the fits files and read in the data , respectively .",
    "the data included the pixel numbers , sky brightnesses , and noise levels .",
    "the pix2xy routine was used to create maps from the data in the _ dirbe _ sky - cube format .",
    "this was followed by converting the sky - cube maps to maps in the mollweide projection using the reproj routine .",
    "maps of both the sky brightnesses and of the rms noise levels were created this way .",
    "the maps of the rms noise levels are hereafter referred to as the sigma maps .",
    "after the creation of the mollweide maps using the idl routines from nasa / gsfc , the section of the all - sky maps corresponding to the orion region was extracted . as was done in w96 , a cosecant - law background of the form @xmath66 was subtracted from the sky - brightness maps , so as to remove foreground and background emission associated with the galactic plane .",
    "the fitting procedure was virtually identical to that used in w96 with a slight change in the algorithm used to determine the galactic latitude @xmath67 from the pixel position .",
    "the earlier paper used a simplistic linear interpolation for determining @xmath67 in the cosecant - law fitting routine .",
    "the current paper uses the exact expression that was used in creating the maps in the mollweide projection .",
    "nevertheless , over the latitude range of the orion maps ( i.e. @xmath68 to @xmath69 ) , the improvement in the algorithm only contributes a 4% change to the scale factors , @xmath70 . as stated in w96 , the uncertainties in the map intensities due to the uncertainty in the background subtraction",
    "is about 10% .",
    "the effects of this subtraction on the results will be discussed in paper  ii @xcite .",
    "these orion maps were compared with those of the 1993 release of the _ dirbe _ data .",
    "the brightnesses of the 140 and 240@xmath3 maps were reduced by about 15% with respect to those of the 1993 maps made .",
    "accordingly , luminosities and masses determined from these maps are also reduced by this amount .",
    "however , the 140@xmath3/240@xmath3 dust color temperatures are virtually unchanged .    before creating maps of the 140@xmath3/240@xmath3 dust color temperatures ,",

    "the maps were smoothed with a square flat - topped box that was 3@xmath4pixels @xmath71 3@xmath4pixels in width . since the _ dirbe _",
    "beam size is roughly the same size ( about 2.3@xmath4pixels @xmath71 2.3@xmath4pixels ) and shape , the equivalent resolution after smoothing is roughly @xmath72 larger than the original 42@xmath73 or about 1@xmath74 .",
    "the resultant maps of @xmath75 and @xmath76 are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "as with the intensity maps , the corresponding sigma maps must also be smoothed . here , however , the smoothing procedure is not so straightforward .",
    "suppose the smoothing box is @xmath77pixels @xmath71 @xmath78pixels and @xmath79 is the intensity at pixel @xmath80 in the unsmoothed map .",
    "then the intensity in the smoothed map at the central pixel of the smoothing box , @xmath81 , is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the total number of pixels in the smoothing box .",
    "if the pixels are independent , then the rms noise level in the smoothed map at the central pixel of the smoothing box , @xmath84 , is @xmath85 however , if the @xmath79 are already convolved with a beam the same size and shape as the smoothing box ( i.e. @xmath77pixels @xmath71 @xmath78pixels ) , then @xmath84 can be approximated by @xmath86 equation ( [ dp02 ] ) states that the noise in the smoothed map is a factor @xmath87 below the quadrature average of the noise levels in the smoothing box .",
    "this is expected when the pixels are independent because the random walk applies . on the other hand ,",
    "equation ( [ dp03 ] ) states that the noise in the smoothed map is only a factor of @xmath72 below the quadrature average of the noise levels in the smoothing box .",
    "this is because the area of the effective beam is roughly doubled ( exactly doubled in the case of gaussian smoothing and a gaussian beam ) after convolution with a smoothing box the same size as the original beam .",
    "equation ( [ dp03 ] ) has been tested with simulated maps of random noise . after discarding pixels along the map edges",
    ", it was found that for 99.9% of the pixels equation ( [ dp03 ] ) must be either corrected downward or upward by up to 30% .",
    "this is not a large correction to random noise estimates .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ dp03 ] ) was used in smoothing the sigma maps .",
    "the map of the dust color temperatures ( which is the actual dust grain temperature for the large grains in thermal equilibrium in the case of homogeneous dust properties along the line of sight , assuming the spectral emissivity index is correct ) is created in the same way as in w96 .",
    "the dust temperature , @xmath38 , is derived from inverting @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the quoted _ dirbe _ intensities at frequencies @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath92 is the frequency at @xmath94 , @xmath93 is the frequency at @xmath95 , @xmath37 is the planck function , and @xmath96 is the _ dirbe _ band color correction .",
    "even though these color corrections never vary by more than 8% from 1.0 , their ratio , @xmath97 , can vary by up to 14% from 1.0 in the temperature range , @xmath98@xmath99 .",
    "consequently , the color corrections were necessary for obtaining accurate dust color temperatures .",
    "although there is evidence that @xmath40 can vary spatially by 1020% on sub - parsec scales , adopting @xmath100 is still valid on the scale of a few parsecs for the reasons given in w96 .",
    "equation ( [ dp04 ] ) was solved for @xmath38 by plotting @xmath38 as a function of @xmath101 over the temperature range 2.1@xmath4k to 210@xmath4k , and fitting polynomials over three subranges within the full range .",

    "the @xmath38 map is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the 1998 release of the _ dirbe _ data includes the sigma maps and this allows the computation of the map of random errors in @xmath38 , i.e. , a @xmath103 map . to compute this map rapidly and easily",

    "the wien version of ( [ dp04 ] ) is differentiated and rearranged to give the following simple expression : @xmath104 where it was assumed that the color corrections are only weak functions of @xmath38 and where @xmath105 .",
    "the constants h and k are planck s constant and the maxwell - boltzmann constant , respectively . the relative error in @xmath101 , @xmath106 , was computed from the quadrature sum of the relative errors of the intensities in the 140@xmath3 and 240@xmath3 maps .",
    "it must be emphasized that even though the _ uncertainties _ in @xmath38 are computed from an expression that is based on the wien approximation  i.e. , ( [ dp05 ] )  _ no _ such approximation was used in determining the @xmath38 itself .",
    "therefore , the @xmath38 that appears in ( [ dp05 ] ) was computed from ( [ dp04 ] ) ( or an accurate approximation of it ) , which includes the full planck function and the color corrections . using the accurately determined @xmath38 improves the accuracy of the derived @xmath103 values .",
    "a detailed comparison with @xmath103 determined from a numerical differentiation of ( [ dp04 ] ) shows that the @xmath103 derived from ( [ dp05 ] ) only needs to be corrected upwards by 2025% in the temperature range 1530@xmath4k .",
    "such a correction was not applied and makes little difference to the results .",
    "( this is discussed later in more detail . )    besides the random uncertainties due to noise , there is the overall calibration or photometric uncertainty of the map in each wavelength band .",
    "these are 10.6% and 11.6% in the 140@xmath3 and 240@xmath3 bands , respectively @xcite .",
    "how these systematic uncertainties affect the derived color temperatures , @xmath38 , depends on the relative calibration uncertainty of the 140@xmath3 band with respect to the 240@xmath3 band . in w96 the calibration uncertainty in the @xmath107 ratio",
    "was specified as 6% . adopting that value for the current paper",
    "gives an uncertainty of @xmath108 for @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "these uncertainties are small compared to the relevant range of values of @xmath38 ( i.e. , 1530@xmath4k ) itself .",
    "consequently , the systematic uncertainty in the 140@xmath3/240@xmath3 color temperature is roughly equivalent to an upward or downward shift of about 1@xmath4k to the entire @xmath38 map .",
    "the @xmath0 data were obtained with the nagoya 4-m antenna and cover both the orion@xmath4a and orion@xmath4b clouds .",
    "the beamsize is 2.7 and orion@xmath4a was mapped with a 2@xmath73 grid spacing .",
    "full details of the orion@xmath4a observations are given in @xcite .",
    "the orion@xmath4b cloud was mapped with an 8@xmath73 grid spacing .",
    "the data consist of velocity - integrated intensities of the @xmath2 line and were gridded to the _ dirbe _ resolution in the mollweide projection to allow comparison with the _ dirbe _ data .",
    "the regridding procedure was a straightforward conversion from the galactic longitude and latitude of the central position of each pointing of the beam on the sky to _ dirbe _ pixel coordinates in the mollweide projection .",
    "these pixel coordinates were rounded off to the nearest whole number to give the _ dirbe _ pixel that contains the center of the beam .",
    "this simple approach does not take into account the cases where a given pointing of the 2.7 beam spills over the edges of given _ dirbe _ pixel .",
    "however , this is not an important consideration given that the _ dirbe_-gridded map is then smoothed by 3@xmath4pixels @xmath71 3@xmath4pixels .",
    "each _ dirbe _",
    "pixel was  hit \" by a few pointings of the nagoya beam and the corresponding intensities were averaged for each _ dirbe _ pixel .",
    "the 1-@xmath113 noise level of the nagoya integrated intensity map was 0.7@xmath114 .",
    "after regridding to the _ dirbe _ resolution , the noise - level was computed for each _ dirbe _ pixel by dividing the nagoya map noise - level by the square - root of the number of hits of the nagoya beam in that pixel .",
    "hence , the regridding process produced both an integrated intensity map of the @xmath2 line and a corresponding sigma map .",
    "as was done with the _ dirbe _ maps , the @xmath0 map was smoothed by 3@xmath4pixels @xmath71 3@xmath4pixels .",
    "the sigma map was smoothed using equation ( [ dp02 ] ) , since the pixels are independent in this case .    as mentioned above",
    ", the orion@xmath4b section of the original nagoya map has an 8@xmath73 grid spacing even though the beam is only 2.7 in size .",
    "this spacing gives gaps in the coverage .",
    "these gaps do not result in large systematic errors in the velocity - integrated intensities in the final map , largely because all the data were gridded to the _ dirbe _ resolution .",
    "systematic errors in the map intensities due to incomplete coverage can be estimated by comparing the orion@xmath4a observations on the grid with 2@xmath73 spacing with those same observations on a grid with 8@xmath73 spacing .",
    "both the 2@xmath73 grid and 8@xmath73grid orion@xmath4a data were regridded to the _ dirbe _ resolution and then smoothed by 3@xmath4pixels @xmath71 3@xmath4pixels .",
    "the median of the intensities of the map that was originally on an 8@xmath73 grid were 1011% lower than that of the map that was originally on a 2@xmath73 grid .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the orion@xmath4b observations need to be corrected upwards by , on average , about 10% .",
    "such a correction was not applied , because this is only a small change that will not affect the results significantly and because application of a single scale factor to _ all _ the orion@xmath4b intensities is overly simplistic .    a final consideration for comparison of the @xmath0 data with the _ dirbe _ data is whether background subtraction , as was done for the _ dirbe _ data , is necessary .",
    "as was found in w96 for the @xmath20 data , such background subtraction for molecular line data produced virtually no change in their intensities in the orion fields .",
    "consequently , no background subtraction was applied to the @xmath0 map .",
    "the map of velocity - integrated radiation temperature of the @xmath2 line , or @xmath115 , is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "other datasets used in this research include the map of the integrated intensities of the @xmath18 line , the map of the integrated intensities of the h@xmath4i 21-cm line , and the map of the peak @xmath18 radiation temperatures .",
    "the maps of the integrated intensities of the @xmath18 line and of the h@xmath4i 21-cm line were described in w96 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as in w96 , an integrated co line intensity to molecular gas column density , or x - factor , of @xmath116 is assumed .",
    "recent work by @xcite suggests that an x - factor of @xmath117 is more appropriate for the orion clouds . as will be discussed in section  [ ssec36 ] , this is indeed a more appropriate value ( at least for the one - component models fitted to the data ) , but the value of @xmath118 is adopted for consistency with w96 .",
    "after regridding the data to the _ dirbe _ resolution and performing the usual 3@xmath4pixel @xmath71 3@xmath4pixel smoothing , the noise levels in the co and h@xmath4i integrated intensity maps were estimated from the negative tails of the histograms .",
    "the 1-@xmath113 noise levels are 0.7 and 0.2 in units of @xmath119 for the co and hi , respectively .",
    "as described in w96 , a smooth background representing large - scale background and foreground galactic emission was subtracted from the h@xmath4i map .",
    "no such background was subtracted from the co map because it made little difference to the resulting intensities .",
    "both the regridded co and h@xmath4i maps can be seen in figure  3a of w96 .",
    "the peak @xmath18 radiation temperatures were provided by r. maddalena and t. dame ( priv .",
    "comm . ) . as with the other datasets ,",
    "these radiation temperatures were gridded to the mollweide projection with the same pixels as in the _ dirbe _ maps and then smoothed by 3@xmath4pixels @xmath71 3@xmath4pixels .",
    "the negative tail of the histogram of the map of peak @xmath18 radiation temperatures suggests a noise level of 0.15@xmath4k .",
    "this is consistent with the noise level in the map of integrated co brightnesses for line widths of about 2@xmath120 . as with the integrated co map , background subtraction was not necessary .",
    "this map looks very similar to the integrated co map and , consequently , is not shown .",
    "the ratio @xmath121 , abbreviated as @xmath122 , is shown as a contour map in figure  [ fig5 ] and is plotted against the 140@xmath3/240@xmath3 color temperature , or @xmath38 , in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the points in figure  [ fig6 ] represent the high signal - to - noise positions : those positions with signal at or above 5-@xmath113 in @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath115 .",
    "the total number of points in the plot is 674 , but these are not totally independent . given that the effective beamsize is about 3@xmath4pixels @xmath71 3@xmath4pixels , the effective number of points is about 70 .",
    "( this is actually a conservative estimate to the effective number of points , because , even though the pixels within the effective beam are not completely _",
    "in_dependent , neither are they completely _ de_pendent . ) this number is important for assigning a confidence level to the model fits .",
    "the physical models used to interpret figure  [ fig6 ] include single - component lte models , single - component non - lte models , and two - component non - lte models . except where mentioned otherwise ,",
    "the models are based on the following assumption : this will be referred to as the _",
    "basic assumption_. obviously , this assumption is not strictly correct , but is nevertheless roughly correct in describing the overall trends in the data .",
    "thus the @xmath123 statistic that quantifies the goodness of the fit is not only measuring the scatter due to observational uncertainties , but also the scatter due to the real physical variations not accounted for in the basic assumption .",
    "the best fit of a certain class of models is found by adjusting a set of model parameters , @xmath124 , so as to minimize the @xmath123 . because there are errors in both variables",
    " i.e. @xmath125 and @xmath126 or , more specifically , @xmath38 and @xmath122  the expression for @xmath123 must reflect this : @xmath127 ^ 2\\ + \\ \\left[{y_{o\\,i}-y_{m\\,i}(\\{a_j\\})\\over\\sigma(y_{o\\,i})}\\right]^2\\quad , \\label{mr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath128 represents observed data point @xmath129 , @xmath130 is the point on the model curve closest to data point @xmath129 , the @xmath131 are the parameters that characterize the model curve , and @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the random errors for data point @xmath129 in @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "the closest point on the model curve to data point @xmath129 is defined as that point on the curve that gives the minimum @xmath134 .",
    "expressions ( [ mr1 ] ) and ( [ mr2 ] ) represent orthogonal regression , in which the fit seeks to minimize the perpendicular distance between each point and the model curve . in the following sections , we examine the following cases : lte , non - lte one component , and non - lte two components .      in this section the @xmath2 line is assumed to be in lte and optically thin .",
    "in practice , lte means that the gas density is high enough that the line strength is not _",
    "explicitly _ dependent on that density",
    ". the critical density of this line , at which the downward collisional transition rate is equal to the spontaneous radiative transition rate , is @xmath135 .",

    "assuming lte has the advantage that it is only necessary to fit one parameter , @xmath138 .",
    "the model curve to be fit is @xmath139 where q is the rotational partition function for @xmath0 and @xmath140 is the correction for the cosmic background radiation .",
    "the reader is referred to appendices  [ appa ] and [ appb ] for details .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the model curves of equation  ( [ mr3 ] ) for @xmath141 to @xmath142 .    the optimum value found for @xmath143 for the lte models , i.e. @xmath144 , is far from satisfactory : as is seen in figure  [ fig8 ] , even though this curve goes through the center of the triangular cluster of points , it is systematically too high for the points with @xmath145 .",
    "indeed , the chi - square per degree of freedom is @xmath146 . fitting only to the points with @xmath145 gives the result @xmath147 with @xmath148 , but this curve is too low for the center of the triangular cluster of points . in addition , neither the @xmath149 curve nor the @xmath150 curve match the high-@xmath122 or low-@xmath122 points in the triangular cluster .",
    "the uncertainties specified for the above @xmath143 value are the formal uncertainties due to the random errors .",

    "the uncertainty in the abundance of @xmath0 , x(@xmath0 ) .",
    "this affects the relationship between the co column density and the h@xmath7 column density . again",
    ", 20% is adopted as the contribution to the uncertainty in the model curve .",
    "the uncertainty in the dust optical depth to total gas column density , @xmath152 .",
    "this affects the relationship of @xmath76 to n(h ) ( see equation [ apb6 ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that this contributes an uncertainty of 20% to the model curve .    for simplicity ,",
    "all of the above have adopted uncertainties of 20% , which is a number that is roughly appropriate for the above cases . also , these uncertainties are independent of one another , so that they should be added quadratically .",
    "this gives an overall uncertainty of 30 - 40% between the model curves and the data .",
    "note that the systematic and random uncertainties are treated separately .",
    "the systematic uncertainties represent a simple scaling up or down of the axes in plots of one quantity against another , while the overall distribution of points in a plot does not change .",
    "hence , parameters determined from fits to the data , like line slopes , are simply scaled up or down accordingly .",
    "the random uncertainties , however , represent random reshapings of the distribution of points in a plot and must be included in the model fitting procedure .    to test the effect of the systematic uncertainties on the result",
    ", the model fitting is repeated after applying scale factors to the model curves .",
    "the scale factors used in the new model fits deviate by as much as 40% from unity and are in steps of 20% : 0.6 , 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.2 , and 1.4 .",
    "as figure  [ fig9 ] clearly shows , the total variation in the resultant @xmath143 values due to the systematic uncertainties is much larger than the error bars of the random or formal uncertainties . for the fits to all the high signal - to - noise positions",

    "for the fits to the high signal - to - noise positions with @xmath145 , the @xmath143 varies from @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "such a strong variation of @xmath143 , a range of 30@xmath4k for the fits to all the high signal - to - noise data , means that @xmath143 can not be determined in this simple lte case .",
    "this is not surprising given that the fits are not very good .",
    "also , since only one parameter varies anyway , scaling the model curves varies that one parameter  @xmath143 in this case .",
    "another test of the model fit is to compare the gas column density as derived from the continuum observations , @xmath157 , to that derived from the @xmath2 line , @xmath158 .",
    "the @xmath157 values are determined from a trivial rearrangement of equation ( [ apb6 ] ) in appendix  [ appb ] and the @xmath158 values come from @xmath159 in analogy to equation  ( [ apb3 ] ) .",

    "the systematic uncertainty in @xmath158 is 20% due to the calibration uncertainty in @xmath115 .",
    "the quadrature sum of these two uncertainties means that the systematic uncertainty in the slope in the @xmath158 versus @xmath157 plot is about 40% .",
    "the slope of the plotted straight line and the y - intercept , as stated above , were determined from a routine that considers the uncertainties in both @xmath125 and @xmath126 , similar to the orthogonal regression method discussed previously .",

    "the slope of the plot , 1.06@xmath1640.03 , suggests that the column densities derived from the @xmath0 line agree favorably with those determined from the continuum .",
    "however , the scatter is large : @xmath165 .",
    "this is clearly a reflection of the bad fit of the single - component , lte model to the data .    as a comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] also includes a plot of the gas column density as derived from applying the usual conversion factor to the integrated intensity of @xmath18 , i(@xmath20 ) .",
    "as stated previously , the conversion factor employed was @xmath166 .",
    "the slope in the fitted line is 1.40@xmath1640.04 .",
    "this suggests that a more appropriate value for the conversion factor is @xmath167 ; this will discussed further in section  [ ssec36 ] .",
    "this value for the x - factor is only a crude average for the orion clouds , because there is large scatter about the straight - line fit : @xmath168 . despite this large scatter ,",
    "the @xmath20-derived column densities are within a factor of 2 of those derived from the continuum observations for about 80% of the points .",
    "so even on sub - cloud scales , the x - factor seems to give column densities that are correct to within a factor of 2 for most positions .",
    "comparison of the scatter in the upper and lower panels of figure  [ fig10 ] may provide insights into the reliability of @xmath20-derived column densities .",
    "while the @xmath151 for the lower - panel straight - line fit with the @xmath20-derived column densities is nearly double that for the upper panel , the samples of points in the two panels are not the same .",
    "the sample with the @xmath0-derived column densities includes only those positions with greater than 5-@xmath113 in @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath115 .",

    "however , considering that the single - component lte models used here do _ not _ properly characterize the data , this conclusion would be premature .",
    "another important point to consider is that of the area filling factors of the gas .",

    "the @xmath173 is the area filling factor and is the fraction of the beam area that has gas emission at the frequency @xmath36 within the line profile . given that the @xmath18 line is optically thick , equation ( [ mr4 ] ) can be written as @xmath174 figure  [ fig11 ] shows the @xmath173 for the peak of the @xmath18 line profile determined from ( [ mr6 ] ) plotted against the continuum - derived column densities .",
    "the gas kinetic temperatures were computed in the same way as for the column density calculations .",
    "there are two important things to notice in this plot .",
    "one is that , on average , positions with higher column densities have higher filling factors .",
    "this is expected : as the gas column density increases , there is an increasing number of cloud substructures or clumps along the line of sight . on average ,",
    "more and more of the beam area is filled with clumps .",
    "another thing to notice is that all the area filling factors are less than unity , as expected for a geometric filling factor . in short , the single - component ,",
    "lte models are not very successful in explaining the @xmath122 versus @xmath38 plot . at best",

    "non - lte effects on the @xmath2 line emission are considered .",
    "also , the effects of non - negligible optical depths are also considered . to model the non - lte line emission , the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) method",
    "was used @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is its simplicity .",
    "photodissociation region ( pdr ) models ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are considerably more complicated and not necessary for the crude modeling done here .",
    "the lvg method assumes that every point in the gas is identical to every other point , with the exception of the velocities . in the spherical geometry case , every point in the gas",
    "is surrounded by points moving away from it in a spherically symmetric pattern with more distant points moving away even more rapidly  similar to a cosmological hubble flow .",
    "hence , every point in the gas is radiatively coupled to , and at the center of , a spherical region . outside this region ,",
    "the line emission of the gas is redshifted beyond that of the gas at the center of the sphere and , consequently , radiatively decoupled from it .",
    "this spherical geometry can then estimate the line emission from a spherical clump .",
    "this is only an estimate because the lvg method can not accurately estimate the emission from the edges of a clump .",
    "also , the velocity pattern within the clump would not be spherically symmetric .",
    "nevertheless , the geometry of the region that is radiatively coupled to each point within the clump may be roughly spherical .",
    "each clump is assumed to be radiatively decoupled from the other clumps ; the other clumps that have radial velocities within the clump velocity width of a given clump are assumed to fill a small solid angle with respect to 4@xmath175 steradians .",
    "once some basic parameters are chosen  the molecule , cosmic background temperature , geometry , and the maximum number of levels to be included in the computation  three parameters are specified : the kinetic temperature , gas density , and a third parameter .",
    "this third parameter can be the abundance per unit velocity gradient , @xmath176 for @xmath0 , or the column density per velocity interval , @xmath177 .",
    "it is common to choose @xmath176 as the third parameter , but this has a couple of problems .",
    "one problem is that , by itself , @xmath176 has little physical meaning .",
    "it says , in effect , that a region of the gas with a certain velocity width has a certain size ( assuming fixed abundance ) ; this says very little about the excitation by itself ; the density must also be known . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath177 states that a region of gas with a particular velocity width has a certain column density ; this provides strong clues to the level of radiative trapping .",
    "for example , in the range of parameter space described in the next paragraph , given the optical depth of the @xmath15 line of co for given @xmath25 and @xmath177 values , one can estimate the optical depth to within a factor of ten for other values of @xmath25 and @xmath177 about 80% of the time _ even without knowing the gas density _ ( provided that that unknown density is held constant ) .",
    "another problem with using @xmath176 is that the effects of collisions and radiative trapping are mixed together , making interpretation of observational data more difficult .",
    "specifically , the gas density , @xmath178 , affects not only the collisions but also the column density . because @xmath179 , raising @xmath178 for fixed @xmath176 also raises @xmath177 , thereby raising the line optical depth while also raising the collision rate .",
    "this results in misleading impressions of the density sensitivity of line emission .",
    "for example , it has been mistakenly found that the @xmath180 intensity ratio is sensitive to @xmath178 .",
    "this intensity ratio when plotted as a function of @xmath178 for fixed @xmath176 does show a strong variation with @xmath178 , but this is because the rising @xmath178 also results in rising @xmath181 and , of course , the @xmath180 intensity ratio _ is _ sensitive to @xmath181 .",
    "( in fact , @xmath181 is equivalent to this intensity ratio in the lte , optically thin limit . )",
    "being unaware of this coupling between optical depth and density has led to errors in interpretation of the data .",
    "in one case , the authors went so far as to conclude that the molecular gas in the galaxy m@xmath451 must have temperatures of several hundred kelvins on scales of hundreds of parsecs , based on a comparison of the @xmath15 lines of hcn , @xmath0 , and @xmath20 @xcite ; this despite the much simpler and much more likely interpretation of low - temperature gas with optically thin @xmath2 emission .",
    "therefore we choose @xmath177 to be the third parameter used in the lvg models .",
    "the specific range of parameter space used in the modeling is as follows :    * @xmath182 to 40.7@xmath4k in steps of 0.1@xmath4k .",
    "* @xmath183 $ ] = 1 to 5 in steps of 0.25 . *",
    "@xmath184 $ ] = 15.5 to 18.3 in steps of 0.2 .",
    "the reason for the chosen lower limit on @xmath177 has to do with the observed column densities of the orion clouds .",
    "the majority of positions , 93% , have @xmath185 .",
    "negligible n(h@xmath4i ) and cloud line widths of 2@xmath120 mean that this limit corresponds to @xmath186 . using the abundances given in appendix  [ appa",
    "] , this is equivalent to @xmath187 .",
    "this column density per velocity interval represents a large - scale cloud property , for some positions in the orion clouds , and must _ not _ be confused with the column density per velocity interval within the individual substructures or clumps .",
    "the @xmath177 values within the clumps can be higher than the large - scale values for a cloud .",
    "however , the values for @xmath177 can not be much smaller than the large - scale value without also having many clumps within a given velocity interval that are radiatively coupled .",
    "radiatively coupled clumps means that the effective @xmath177 is roughly the sum of the @xmath177 values for the individual clumps .",
    "consequently , values much less than the large - scale cloud @xmath177 value are not meaningful .",
    "therefore , a lower limit of @xmath188 is adopted , which is not too low for 93% of the high signal - to - noise positions ( i.e. those positions represented in fig  [ fig6 ] ) in the orion clouds .    to develop the expression for @xmath122 that uses lvg model results , we start with @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the continuum intensity .",

    ". therefore the emission of the two components can simply be added together .",
    "consequently , the specific intensity of the continuum emission averaged over the beam , @xmath190 , is given by @xmath221 where @xmath222 is defined as @xmath223 combining equations ( [ apb1 ] ) , ( [ apb2 ] ) , ( [ apb5 ] ) and removing the column density factor .",

    "this correction is @xmath280 where @xmath157 is the  true \" dust - derived column density inferred from the observations in the two - component case , @xmath281 is the dust - derived column density that _ would be _ inferred from the observations assuming one component only , @xmath282 is the model column density for a two - component model , and @xmath283 is the model column density that would result if a single component were assumed .",
    "specifically , this single component would have the color temperature , @xmath264 , and the specific intensity of the two - component model , as given by ( [ mr26 ] ) .",
    "so the right side of ( [ mr34 ] ) is the correction factor that would be applied to the model column density to obtain the  true \" model column density .",
    "equation  ( [ mr34 ] ) then applies this correction factor to the actual observations . if all the column densities in ( [ mr34 ] ) are beam - averaged column densities , then @xmath284 and @xmath285 equation  ( [ mr35 ] ) is combination of equations ( [ mr20 ] ) , ( [ mr22 ] ) , ( [ mr23 ] ) , and ( [ mr24 ] ) .",

    "the uncertainties in @xmath157 are discussed in appendix  [ appf ] .",
    "figure  [ fig28 ] is the plot of the @xmath0-derived column densities versus the dust - derived gas column densities .",
    "clearly the agreement is much better than for the one - component models : @xmath290 .",
    "the slope of the straight - line fit , @xmath291 , is within the error of the corresponding slope for the one - component , lvg models . _",
    "it is clear that the two - component models are significantly better than the one - component models . _",
    "the filling factors as a function of spectral line derived column densities in the lvg , two - component case are plotted in figure  [ fig29 ] .",
    "the filling factors were derived using a two - component analog of equation  ( [ mr6 ] ) .",
    "specifically , an effective excitation temperature , @xmath292 , is determined from @xmath293 where @xmath294 and @xmath295 are the excitation temperatures of the @xmath18 line in components one and zero , respectively .",
    "this effective excitation temperature is the brightness temperature that would be observed at frequency @xmath36 if the gas filled the beam at the velocity in the line profile corresponding to frequency @xmath36 .",
    "( note that this assumes that the line is optically thick .",
    "note also that @xmath292 includes the rayleigh - jeans correction and the correction for the background . ) the excitation temperatures , @xmath294 and @xmath295 , were computed with the following method . each observed position has an associated point on the model curve .",
    "the point on the model curve has associated @xmath263 , @xmath261 , and @xmath143 values .",
    "these allow computation of the @xmath248 and @xmath249 values .",
    "the point on the model curve is also associated with the other model parameters , which permit determination of the @xmath294 and @xmath295 values from lvg models of the @xmath20 line strengths . in particular , the @xmath15 line of @xmath20 is optically thick and , as such , radiative trapping keeps the line closer to lte .",
    "therefore , the conversion from kinetic temperature to excitation temperature is close to unity . specifically , the following approximations are accurate to within a few percent :    @xmath296 \\qquad . \\label{mr41b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    over the observed temperature range , the conversion of @xmath248 to @xmath294 deviates from unity by no more than about an 8% .",
    "the filling factor is then given by @xmath297 the value of @xmath173 at the line peak is plotted in figure  [ fig29 ] . as in the one - component cases ,",
    "the filling factors , on average , increase with increasing column density .",
    "again there is saturation with increasing column density .",
    "however , for these models , the area - filling factors can have non - physical values ( i.e. @xmath298 ) .",
    "in fact , some observed positions _ seem _ to have @xmath173 up to about 6",
    ". since these are area - filling factors , they can not be greater than unity .",
    "even if we were to reinterpret @xmath173 as the number of clumps per line of sight within a clump velocity width , there would still be a problem : the effective column density per velocity interval would be higher than , and therefore inconsistent with , the values of @xmath256 and @xmath257 determined from the model fits . only for @xmath299",
    "is there no such problem , because some lines of sight within the beam , and within a clump velocity interval , can be free of clumps while others can have a single clump ( with the properties given by the model fit ) . when @xmath300 , lines of sight that have clumps will , on average , have more than one clump in a clump velocity interval , thereby forcing the effective @xmath177 to be higher than the fitted @xmath256 and @xmath257 values . in addition , given that this is a filling factor within a clump velocity interval and that @xmath18 is optically thick , detecting more than one clump per line of sight within a narrow velocity interval is not possible , because the clump in front would block the emission of the ones behind .",
    "nevertheless , the problem of the unphysical @xmath173 values has a solution .",
    "both the numerator and denominator of ( [ mr29 ] ) depend , explicitly or implicitly , on the product @xmath301 , and _ not _ on the individual @xmath277 and @xmath254 values alone , over a large range parameter space . accordingly , over that range of parameter space , @xmath122 depends on that product and determining the parameters @xmath277 and @xmath254 separately is very difficult .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig27 ] shows that @xmath277 and @xmath254 are roughly anticorrelated .",
    "the plot of their product shows that it is constant to within a factor of roughly 3 about some geometric mean .",
    "consequently , restricting @xmath277 to some desired range can still yield physically reasonable fits .",
    "this will be examined in the next section .    in summary ,",
    "the two - component , lvg models are reasonably good in explaining the @xmath122 versus @xmath264 plot , which is in stark contrast to the one - component models .",
    "examination of the systematic uncertainties suggests that @xmath143 and @xmath261 are known to within 1@xmath4k or better and @xmath278 is known to within a factor of 2 about some geometric mean .",
    "other parameters like @xmath277 and @xmath252 are known to within factors of 4 or 5 about a geometric mean , while the remaining component-0 parameters , @xmath254 and @xmath276 can vary by factors of @xmath302 about the geometric mean . while a different class of two - component models could possibly explain the entire triangular cluster of points in the @xmath122 versus @xmath264 plot , the two - component models described here only explain the triangular cluster for @xmath303k .",
    "the points in the triangular cluster with @xmath304k are not accounted for with the current models .",
    "another problem with the current models is that they predict area - filling factors that are unphysical for many of the observed positions . and",
    "this problem will be addressed in the following section .      as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the two - component models suffer from a non - trivial physical drawback : the area - filling factors for some positions are greater than unity .",
    "another problem is that the two - component models do not fit the @xmath305k points well . as discussed in that section ,",
    "keeping @xmath277 large enough will ensure that the filling factors have more reasonable values .",
    "therefore , in this section we will consider models where @xmath277 is restricted to be @xmath306 .",
    "to better fit @xmath305k points , we divide the points into two subsamples : one subsample with @xmath307k and the other with @xmath308k .",
    "we fit the two - component , lvg models with @xmath309 _ only _ to the @xmath307k subsample .",
    "the @xmath305k subsample has a relatively simply trend and we need only fit the one - component models that were used in section  [ ssec32 ] .",
    "notice that we are relaxing the basic assumption somewhat : we are allowing parameters , in addition to @xmath38 and @xmath25 , to change from one subsample to the other subsample .",
    "however , within each subsample we still impose the basic assumption .",
    "the parameter values resulting from the fits to the two subsamples are listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the resultant model curves are shown in figure  [ fig30 ] .",
    "casual inspection of the curves in figure  [ fig30 ] suggests that these models better characterize the data than the simple two - component models of the previous section .",
    "however , the appropriate combination of the @xmath151 values in table  [ tbl-2 ] into a reduced chi - square that characterizes _ both _ curves together yields @xmath310 .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] shows that the two - component models of the previous section yielded a best fit of @xmath311 .",
    "hence , the model curves for the two subsamples fit the data with essentially the same goodness of fit as for the simple two - component models . to be consistent with the two - component model fit to the @xmath307k subsample",
    ", we could try to fit a two - component model to the @xmath305k subsample .",
    "this two - component fit to the @xmath307k subsample , when combined with that for the @xmath312k subsample , gives an overall @xmath313 .",
    "again , this is _ not _ significantly better than the simple two - component models for the entire sample of points .",
    "also , this model requires fixing @xmath261 at 18@xmath4k to get a reasonable fit .",
    "therefore , only the one - component model fit to the @xmath312k subsample is listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] and is used in the column density and filling factor determinations .    if we consider only that the goodness of fit is no better and that extra model parameters are required , then the models discussed in this section should be ignored in favor of the two - component models for the entire sample of points . however , the two - component , two - subsample model described here has three important advantages .",
    "one is that the model fits the @xmath305k points better .",
    "the second advantage is that the agreement between the dust - derived column densities , @xmath157 , and the @xmath0-derived column densities , @xmath158 , is noticeably improved .",
    "figure  [ fig31 ] shows the plot of @xmath158 versus @xmath157 .",
    "the @xmath151 of the straight line fit to the points in this plot is 5.3 , compared with 7.4 in the corresponding plot for the simple two - component models .",
    "this an improvement with a 90% confidence level , according to the f - test .",
    "another advantage to the two - component , two - subsample models is seen in figure  [ fig32 ] , which shows the area - filling factors , @xmath173 , versus the @xmath0-derived molecular gas column densities , @xmath160 .",
    "the filling factors are now all ( or almost all ) less than or equal to unity , as desired .",
    "as was seen for the one - component models , the filling factors here again show saturation with increasing column density .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated from the work of the previous sections . for the @xmath307k subsample ,",
    "the uncertainties of the two - component model parameters are largely systematic . as such",
    ", the uncertainties should be similar to those for the two - component models fitted to the entire sample of points ( see previous section ) .",
    "however , our estimates of those uncertainties for the component-1 density , @xmath278 must be modified .",
    "the previous section suggests that @xmath278 is known to within a factor of 2 about a geometric mean of possible densities .",
    "however , the @xmath278 for the current section is 2 orders of magnitude larger than for the previous section .",
    "hence , we can only place a lower limit of @xmath314 on @xmath278 .",
    "we obtain a higher density value in the current section , possibly because the densities in the @xmath307k subsample are 2 orders of magnitude higher than some kind of average density for the whole sample .",
    "indeed , we find that the @xmath305k subsample has a density that is lower by more than an order of magnitude . however , the @xmath307k subsample has always dominated the results of the fits ; the results obtained for this subsample are nearly identical to those for the whole sample .",
    "therefore , this method likely places only a rough lower limit on the density .",
    "this is expected because the @xmath2 transition is insensitive to densities higher than about @xmath315 .",
    "thus the uncertainties in the parameter values for the @xmath307k subsample are the same as those for the entire sample points ( see the previous section ) with the exception that the component-1 density only has a lower limit of @xmath314 .",
    "the parameter uncertainties for the @xmath305k subsample are again dominated by the systematics .",
    "the @xmath143 versus scale factor for the one - component models , i.e. figure  [ fig16 ] , shows that the fit to the @xmath305k points varies from @xmath316 to @xmath317k .",
    "hence we can say that @xmath318k .",
    "this uncertainty is only slightly larger ( i.e. less than a factor of 2 ) than the formal uncertainty given in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the plot of @xmath177 versus scale factor suggests that only the formal uncertainties in @xmath177 are important .",
    "however , the two - component model fitted to the @xmath305k sample suggests larger systematic uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath256 value found ( which corresponds to the @xmath177 value in the one - component model ) is less than a factor of 2 greater than the @xmath177 value found for the one - component model .",
    "the systematic uncertainties ( see the plot of @xmath256 versus scale factor in figure  [ fig27 ] ) suggest that @xmath177 varies between about @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "( recall that it can not be lower than about @xmath321 because the large - scale observed @xmath177 represents a lower limit . ) as for the systematic uncertainty of the density , figure  [ fig16 ] suggests that , again , only a lower limit is applicable .",
    "this lower limit is @xmath322 .",
    "it is interesting that the two - component model results for the @xmath305k subsample suggest a component-1 density identical to that of the one - component model fit .",
    "one noticeable problem with the current models is the abrupt transition in the solid curve when crossing the @xmath323k boundary .",
    "a more natural - looking curve would have a smooth transition across this boundary .",
    "examination of the different parameter values for both subsamples suggests that gradually decreasing the @xmath252 value by factors of 4 to 6 when going from the @xmath307k subsample to the @xmath305k subsample ( thereby becoming the @xmath177 value for the one - component model for the latter subsample ) could possibly produce the desired smooth curve .",
    "note that other solutions , such as varying @xmath278 would _ not _ produce a satisfactory solution , because it would not merge well with the low-@xmath264 curve .",
    "also , the component-0 parameters @xmath277 , @xmath254 , and @xmath276 have little affect on the overall curve shape and are irrelevant for the @xmath305k subsample .",
    "therefore , the @xmath305k subsample clumps are likely to have @xmath177 values that are factors of a few lower than those in the @xmath307k subsample .",
    "the dashed curve on the @xmath324k side of figure  [ fig30 ] suggests another possibility .",
    "the current models do not account for the vertical spread of the points ( neither in the @xmath324k side nor in the triangular cluster mostly on the @xmath307k side ) in the @xmath122 versus @xmath264 plot .",
    "also , they do not account for the horizontal spread of the triangular cluster , although this spread is probably due to the large uncertainties in @xmath264 for some of these points . the dashed curve on the @xmath324k side passes through the high-@xmath122 .",
    "accordingly , two or more subsamples could indeed account for these spreads _ if _ the curves for _ all _ the subsamples were applied to the whole range of observed color temperatures .",
    "however , what is the optimum way of separating these two ( or more ) subsamples ? separating them according to dust temperature is simplistic : the @xmath305k solution , for example , does not pass through points on the @xmath325k side ( i.e. the dashed line on that side ) that are far from the @xmath325k solution ( the solid curve on that side ) .",
    "the optimum separation of these subsamples would involve two ( or more ) curves for the whole color temperature range of that would correctly characterize all the points in the plot . in other words ,",
    "the basic assumption in its simplest form is not correct .",
    "nonetheless , the basic assumption imposed within each subsample would simplify the modeling .",
    "for now , we keep the current two - component , two - subsample model parameters because they represent an adequate characterization of the data .    in summary ,",
    "the two - component , two - subsample models produce a similarly good fit to the @xmath122 versus @xmath264 plot as the simple two - component models , but fix the problems of the unphysical filling factors and the poor fit to the high-@xmath38 points .",
    "also , the dust - derived and @xmath0-derived column densities agree better for these two - subsample models than for the models fitted to the whole sample . also , the current two - component , two - subsample models hint that the optimum choice of subsamples has yet to be found .",
    "this will be left to future work .      as a rough illustration of the limitations of the basic assumption and of the modeling ,",
    "a few reference or fiducial points were chosen in the @xmath122 versus @xmath264 plots .",
    "these points roughly follow the overall shape of the sample in these plots .",
    "specifically , four of the fiducial points approximately represent the corners and centroid of the triangular cluster of points and the other three fiducial points represent the overall trend in the high-@xmath264 branch .",
    "the fiducial points are represented as diamonds in the @xmath122 versus @xmath264 plots ( i.e. , figures  [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] , [ fig12 ] , [ fig13 ] , [ fig14 ] , [ fig15 ] , [ fig26 ] , and [ fig30 ] ) .",
    "table  [ tbl-2x ] lists the fiducial points ( in order of increasing @xmath264 ) and the physical properties that pertain to each . because of the basic assumption",
    ", the derived physical properties would be the same for all the points ( except @xmath25 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , when a high-@xmath264 solution was found , as for all but the lvg two - component case , the physical conditions derived for the four fiducial points with @xmath326 were those of the high-@xmath264 solution .",
    "the table lists these physical conditions for the four cases of the previous sections : -17pt    * case 1 : lte , one - component models . -17pt",
    "* case 2 : lvg , one - component models .",
    "-17pt * case 3 : lvg , two - component models . -17pt * case 4 : lvg , two - component , two - subsample models .",
    "-17pt    -17pt    despite representing overall trends , the fiducial points do not necessarily represent the sample as a whole : e.g. , the second , third , and fifth points as listed in table  [ tbl-2x ] , which have distances of 3 or more sigmas from the best - fitting model curves .",
    "the deviations of these three points from each model curve are not just statistical uncertainties ; the models used here simply can not account for the total vertical spread of the points in the sample . the basic assumption does not allow models that would `` fill '' the space occupied by the sample of points in the @xmath122 versus @xmath264 plot .",
    "one alternative is to have two or three of these two - compt model curves fit to all the sample simultaneously . in practice , this is time - consuming and is left to a later date .",
    "the derived column densities now allow us to estimate the masses of the orion clouds .",
    "maps of the column densities are presented in figures  [ fig33 ] to [ fig35 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig33 ] shows the column density maps derived from the observations using the lvg , one - component model results , figure  [ fig34 ] the analogous maps for the two - component , two - subsample case , and figure  [ fig35 ] the maps of column density for just component  1 on those lines of sight where this component has a temperature of 10@xmath4k or less ( i.e. , @xmath327k ) .",
    "the maps of column densities for the lte case are not shown , because they closely resemble the maps of the lvg , one - component case .",
    "the upper panel in each of these figures shows the continuum - derived ( dust - derived ) gas column densities and each lower panel shows the @xmath0-derived gas column densities .",
    "summing these column densities appropriately and using the adopted distance of 450@xmath4pc gives the masses ( _ not _ including helium ) listed in tables  [ tbl-3 ] , [ tbl-4 ] , [ tbl-5 ] , and [ tbl-6 ] .",
    "the random uncertainties in these masses are small : relative uncertainties of the order of 0.5% for the continuum - derived masses , 0.25% for the @xmath20-derived masses , and 6.5% for the @xmath0-derived masses",
    "( although the smaller orion@xmath4nebula and ngc@xmath42024 fields have relative uncertainties of 20% for the @xmath0-derived masses ) . the systematic uncertainties ( i.e. , the uncertainties due to calibration and background - subtraction uncertainties ) are more appreciable : 30% for the continuum - derived masses and",
    "20% for the @xmath0-derived masses .",
    "the model results in each of the four cases were combined with the @xmath2 and h@xmath4i observations to yield the column densities , as described previously , and these were summed to yield the masses in the tables .",
    "all the @xmath0-derived column density maps show a plateau with steep edges .",
    "this plateau is roughly 20@xmath61 wide in longitude and about 6@xmath61 in latitude .",
    "for example , one of the edges of this plateau can be seen running from galactic longitude 216@xmath61 to 208@xmath61 at latitude @xmath328 .",
    "these are approximately the mapped area in @xmath0 . specifically , these edges occur just inside the mapped area s edges , where the observed @xmath2 line strength falls to zero .",
    "these plateau edges are also partly visible in the upper panel of figure  [ fig34 ] , even though this panel does not have the @xmath0-derived column densities .",
    "this is because these  observed \" column densities depend on the two - component , two - subsample model results , which , in turn , require knowledge of the @xmath0 line strengths .",
    "this model dependence is especially true of the cold gas column density maps in figure  [ fig34 ] , resulting in the clear visibility of the plateau edges in the northward and eastward ( i.e. towards the top and left ) directions .",
    "the southward and westward edges are the arbitrary boundaries imposed by selecting only those lines of sight with @xmath329k ; column densities of component  1 on lines of sight with @xmath330k are set to zero .",
    "there are apparent discrepancies between the derived masses ( i.e. tables  [ tbl-3 ] and [ tbl-4 ] ) and the column density versus column density plots ( i.e. , figures  [ fig10 ] , [ fig17 ] , [ fig28 ] , and [ fig31 ] ) .",
    "for example , the ratio of the @xmath20-derived masses in table  [ tbl-3 ] compared to the continuum - derived masses of cases  1 & 2 in table  [ tbl-4 ] is 1.08 , whereas the linear fit in the lower panel of figure  [ fig10 ] suggests a ratio of 1.40 .",
    "there are two reasons for the discrepancy that are related to the signal - to - noise ratio of the observations .",
    "one reason is that the plot of column densities in figure  [ fig10 ] only considers positions with high signal - to - noise data ( i.e. more than 5-@xmath113 in @xmath18 and in the continuum bands ) .",
    "if all the positions in the orion fields were included in the plot , the slope would change to about 1.3 .",
    "the rest of the discrepancy is because of the difference between the slope of a line from linear regression and the ratio of the averages of the ordinate values and abscissa values .",
    "the former represents a sum of values that are weighted by @xmath331 and divided by another sum of similarly weighted values .",
    "determining the total masses by simply summing the column densities in the fields and dividing by another similarly determined sum represents the latter . in other words , the masses in the tables",
    "are not determined from weighted sums , whereas the slopes in the column density plots are indeed determined from such sums .",
    "therefore , the slopes in the column density plots are biased toward the points with higher signal - to - noise ratios _ even _ when these plots include the low signal - to - noise ratio points .",
    "this discrepancy in the ratio between the tables and the plots is simply a consequence of the scatter of the points in these plots .",
    "if there were less scatter , then the tables and the plots would give similar ratios for the @xmath20-derived over continuum - derived masses ( assuming similar coverage in both types of maps ) .",
    "this affects the accuracy of our x - factor estimates .",
    "the slope from the lower panel of figure  [ fig10 ] suggests an x - factor of @xmath167 , whereas comparing the total masses in the tables for the one - component cases suggests an x - factor of @xmath332 .",
    "combining these two numbers gives an estimate of the x - factor of @xmath333 .",
    "this is an uncertainty of about @xmath16415% . thus specifying the x - factor to greater accuracy ( i.e. , a smaller uncertainty ) is meaningless .",
    "an interesting , but crude , comparison can be made with the orion x - factor estimated from figure  8 of @xcite . in that figure , the predicted i(co )",
    "profile that cuts along the orion region is _ on average _ about 20 - 30% higher than that of the observed profile .",
    "accordingly , the predicted x - factor of @xmath334 for the entire galaxy must be increased by factors of about 1.2 to 1.3 to give the _ average _ x - factor for orion .",
    "this gives an average x - factor for orion of about 2.2 - 2.3@xmath335 .",
    "this is consistent with the value derived above .",
    "there is another apparent discrepancy between the plots and the tables ; the total masses derived from @xmath0 ( i.e. , in table  [ tbl-3 ] ) disagree with those derived from the continuum ( i.e. , in table  [ tbl-4 ] ) . in this case , the ratios derived from the tables are more extreme ( i.e. , further from 1 ) than from the column density plots .",
    "the problem here is that the @xmath0 map does not cover the full area covered by the continuum maps .",
    "this results in two problems : a problem with the continuum - derived gas masses and a problem with the @xmath0-derived gas masses .",
    "the former problem is that the two - component - model results can not give the continuum - derived gas column densities outside the area mapped in @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , an observed data point in the @xmath122 versus @xmath264 plot can_not _ be associated with a point on the theoretical curve , because the observed data point can_not _ even be placed in this plot without knowing the @xmath2 line strength .",
    "consequently , the correction factor in equation  ( [ mr39 ] ) is assumed to be unity ( i.e. , @xmath336 is assumed ) for those positions outside the area mapped in @xmath2 .",
    "the latter problem is that the @xmath0 observations alone do _ not _ yield accurate _ total _",
    "masses for these clouds ; the mass estimates from @xmath2 must be corrected for the missing coverage towards the edges of the clouds .",
    "these corrections were estimated by determining the total of the gas masses of the three big fields from the continuum observations for _ only those positions inside the @xmath337 contour _ for each of the four cases ( where cases 1 and 2 are identical for the continuum - derived masses ) .",
    "these were then compared with the continuum - derived masses for all the gas in those fields ( i.e. , the numbers listed as  total \" in table  [ tbl-4 ] ) .    before discussing this comparison , assessing",
    "the accuracy of this method is possible by comparing the continuum - derived masses inside the @xmath337 contour with the @xmath0-derived masses in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "these latter masses represent , in practice , the molecular gas mass inside the @xmath337 contour plus the h@xmath4i mass throughout the entire orion fields .",
    "that is , the masses listed in the  case  1 \" , ",
    "case  2 \" , ",
    "case  3 \" , and ",
    "case  4 \" columns of table  [ tbl-3 ] are the @xmath0-derived molecular gas masses within the @xmath337 contour plus the h@xmath4i mass both inside and outside this contour .",
    "therefore , to assess the accuracy of this correction for the lack of @xmath0 coverage , the continuum - derived masses inside this contour must be corrected upwards for the h@xmath4i mass that lies outside this contour .",
    "mass is 34000@xmath338 . after adding this mass to the continuum - derived masses inside the @xmath337 contour , the continuum - derived masses agree with the @xmath0-derived masses of table  [ tbl-3 ] to within 5 to 10% , depending on the case .    now to correct the total masses in table  [ tbl-3 ] for the gas mass that is missing outside the @xmath337 contour , we compare the continuum - derived masses within this contour with the masses in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "this gives mass differences of 88000@xmath338 in the one - component cases and 87000@xmath338 in the two - component cases . allowing again for the 34000@xmath338 of h@xmath4i outside the @xmath337 contour that is already implicit in table  [ tbl-3 ] requires the masses in table  [ tbl-3 ] to be corrected upwards by 54000@xmath338 in the one - component cases and by 53000@xmath338 in the two - component cases .",
    "the resultant best estimates for the orion gas masses in the one - component case ( for case  2 ) and in the two - component case ( for case  4 ) are in table  [ tbl-5 ] , where the continuum - derived and @xmath0-derived masses agree to within about 5% .",
    "table  [ tbl-6 ] shows that roughly 40 to 50% of the two - component gas mass is in the form of cold ( @xmath339k ) gas ( compare with table  [ tbl-4 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the mass of gas or dust being detected at wavelengths much more sensitive to warm , rather than cold , gas or dust ( e.g. , in the wien limit ) must be corrected upward by a factor of at least 1.6 .",
    "figure  [ fig35 ] shows that the cold component is on one edge of each of the small 2@xmath61 hii - region fields ( i.e. orion@xmath4nebula and ngc@xmath42024 fields ) and is spread out along the northern edge of the orion@xmath4b field .",
    "there is also some cold dust towards the north - eastern edge of the @xmath60orionis field .",
    "a natural question at this point is about a realistic lower limit to the temperature : are gas and dust temperatures as low as 3@xmath4k really necessary for explaining the data ? to test this , two - component models were applied , where @xmath248 was restricted to be @xmath340k .",
    "this gave @xmath341k and @xmath342 .",
    "in other words , the minimum @xmath263 was _ still _ found to be 3@xmath4k .",
    "also , the @xmath123 is a factor of 1.9 higher than the best fit models that had no such restriction on @xmath248 .",
    "this is a worse fit at the 99% confidence level . restricting _ both _",
    "@xmath263 _ and _ @xmath248 would have given an even worse fit .",
    "a less extreme restriction on @xmath248 of @xmath343k gives @xmath344k and @xmath345 .",
    "this fit is worse at almost the 90% confidence level and _ again _ the minimum @xmath263 is 3@xmath4k . in short , avoiding having at least some dust or gas with temperatures near 3@xmath4k is very difficult , provided that the basic assumption is valid .",
    "further discussion of this is deferred to paper  iii @xcite .",
    "since the failings of the basic assumption could be relevant here , longer - wavelength observations confirming the existence of such cold gas or dust would be helpful . the longer wavelength _ firas _ data were used to test this , but the results were inconclusive .",
    "the _ firas _ data extend to a wavelength of about 4@xmath4 mm , making them much less sensitive to the warm dust and , as such , much less _ in_sensitive to the cold dust .",
    "however , the _ firas _ data also have a spatial resolution of 7@xmath61 ; the _ firas _ beam solid angle is a _ factor of 100 larger _ than that of the _ dirbe _ beam .",
    "consequently , a direct comparison with the _ dirbe _ data and the orion fields as defined here is difficult .",
    "nevertheless , such a comparison was attempted as follows :    1 .",
    "the spectra for 183 positions towards and around the orion fields were obtained .",
    "each position had two spectra : a low - frequency spectrum and a high - frequency spectrum .",
    "these were joined to form a single spectrum .",
    "data in the channels that overlapped between the two spectra were averaged with @xmath331 weights .",
    "this yields spectra that cover frequencies of from 68 to 2911@xmath4ghz ( i.e. wavelengths from 4410 to 103@xmath3 ) with channels 13.6@xmath4ghz wide .",
    "the 60 highest frequency channels were then binned into 5 channels to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the 12 channels that went into each of the 5 new channels were averaged with @xmath331 weights .",
    "a background with the form @xmath346 was fitted to each channel from those positions outside the orion fields and farther than half a _ firas _ beam from the galactic plane .",

    "the resultant background spectrum was subtracted from the _ firas _ spectra centered on the orion field centers .",
    "two - component models of modified blackbodies were fitted to thebackground - subtracted spectra .",

    "the best fitting curves had a warm component with temperatures between 17 and 20@xmath4k .",
    "the cold component was very hard to define . assuming that this component even exists , the temperature is around 5@xmath4k , but",
    "could not be pinned down . because of this temperature uncertainty , placing limits on the cold component mass was difficult .",
    "the cold - component mass was anywhere between 0 and 10 times the warm - component mass . in any event , confirming the existence of this cold dust must await long - wavelength spectra with greater spatial resolution and sufficient spatial and wavelength coverage .",
    "we used the 240@xmath3 continuum to the @xmath2 intensity ratio plotted against the 140@xmath3/240@xmath3 dust color as a diagnostic of the dust and gas physical conditions in the orion@xmath4a and b molecular clouds .",
    "model curves were fitted to the data with orthogonal regression .",

    "the component-0 dust temperature _ seems _ to be accurately known and is consistent with the large - scale interstellar radiation field , i.e. 18@xmath4k .",

    "these models suffer from two problems .",
    "the first is that many of the filling factors have unphysical values  i.e. , greater than unity .",

    "the only disadvantage is that this approach is ad hoc .",

    "gas mass derived in the orion fields is @xmath370 , as found in the more realistic two - component case ( and is @xmath371 for the less realistic one - component case ) . due to the systematics ,",
    "the uncertainty in this mass is @xmath372 .",
    "the extra mass in the two - component case is due to the apparent presence of cold dust / gas with temperatures of 3 - 10@xmath4k . attempting to confirm the existence of this cold dust / gas with the long - wavelength firas data was inconclusive due to the insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "the above results have a number of astronomical implications , which are mentioned here only briefly :    1 .   _ dust temperatures equal to gas temperatures :",
    "_ if this surprising result applies to the gas and dust on large scales in our galaxy , then models of gas - to - dust thermal coupling must be revised .",
    "typically , these models assume spherical grains with a single large grain size and a smooth grain surface ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . clearly , relaxing these simple assumptions will increase the surface area - to - volume ratio of the grains and improve the dust - gas thermal coupling , reducing @xmath143 ( see papers  iii and iiia for more details ) . having dust and gas temperatures equal on galactic scales",
    "implies that large - scale molecular gas temperatures are nearly double the temperatures previously believed ( i.e. closer to 20@xmath4k than to 10@xmath4k ) .",
    "also , one dust grain alignment mechanism would be ruled out .",
    "at least two temperatures are needed along each sightline to give reasonable column densities : _ the two - component models show good agreement between spectral line - derived and continuum - derived column densities .",
    "the main difference between the two components is that one component has unvarying temperature from sightline to sightline and the other component has varying temperature .",
    "therefore , except for those few sightlines where the two components have the same temperature , each sightline has two temperatures ( i.e. one temperature  gas and dust  for each component ) . requiring more than one temperature along each sightline is supported by the work of @xcite , who find that assuming a single temperature along each sightline does not give reliable column densities in the perseus and ophiuchus molecular clouds .",
    "3 .   _ cold gas / dust : _ if similar two - component models are correct and are applicable to other large clouds in the galaxy , then the total mass of molecular gas in the galaxy must be revised upwards by about 60% .",
    "millimeter continuum to @xmath2 line ratio as a temperature diagnostic : for the millimeter continuum to @xmath2 intensity ratio above some threshold , this ratio can serve as a diagnostic of the gas / dust temperature , even in the high - temperature limit . 5 .",
    "_ x - factor : _ an improved explanation for the x - factor is applicable .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "discussing the above results in depth would be premature at this point .",
    "we must first examine the modeling and various systematic effects more carefully .",
    "even though we have tested the effects of some systematics on the model curves ( i.e. , by applying scale factors or changing the starting grid when fitting the models ) , we need to find and understand any inherent biases or flaws that the model fitting may have . for example",
    ", the two - component models consistently find a @xmath143 equal to or near 0@xmath4k , in spite of the scale factor applied to the data .",
    "is this because the dust - gas temperature difference really is zero ? or is it simply because these models are biased towards @xmath373k despite its true value ? and what of the reliability of the other parameter values ?",
    "the component-1 density , for example , is supposed to be known to within a factor of a few of 600@xmath374@xmath375 , according to the simple two - component models ( see figure  [ fig27 ] ) . and yet ,",
    "the two - subsample , two - component models suggest densities that are one to three orders of magnitude higher than this . clearly , the methods used thus far to examine the systematics are incomplete . consequently , paper  ii examines the results of running the models on simulated data and will answer the concerns raised here .",
    "in addition to those concerns , there are other questions not yet addressed by the methods used here .",
    "specifically , what is the effect of the background subtractions used ?",
    "how will dust associated with hi affect the results ?",
    "does changing the spectral emissivity index @xmath40 appreciably affect the results ? are there alternative kinds of models that would also explain the data ?",
    "the cloud positions modeled here only represent 26% of the area of the orion clouds ; how representative are the results of the clouds as a whole ?",
    "paper  iii examines these questions .",

    "the column density estimate must be corrected upwards by 64% .",

    "this method has the advantages that assuming the optically thin limit is not necessary and that the additional information provided by the @xmath20 line is used .",
    "however , it also has the disadvantages that the high-@xmath25 limit for the partition function is used and that the gas fills beam in the interval about the @xmath20 line peak is assumed .",
    "the former assumption does not produce very large errors : even down to @xmath498 , the upward correction to the column density found from using the full partition function is only 40% .",
    "the latter assumption is likely wrong for external galaxy observations , because the molecular gas is unlikely to fill the beam in any single velocity interval .",
    "( as discussed in this paper , it is also likely wrong for observations of galactic molecular clouds , but may still be roughly correct to within a factor of about 2 . ) in fact , this assumption can lead , in certain cases , to column density estimates that are wrong by factors of a few or more .",
    "if we consider a few cases with @xmath499 a factor of 20 down from @xmath500 and if @xmath501 is weak , then the column density estimates are too high by factors of 2 to 5 . for example , if the filling factor in each velocity interval is 0.1 and if @xmath502 , the column density estimate is too high by a factor of 5 . even in the less extreme case of @xmath503 and a filling factor of 0.2 , the estimate is too high by a factor of 2 . even if @xmath501 is much stronger , 10@xmath4k , the estimate is still a factor of 2 too high for a filling factor of 0.1 . despite this shortcoming , the correction factor to the column density estimate",
    "is often much less extreme than the filling factor itself . in any event , this method is easily improved by appropriate application of the filling factor to the equations used to derive the optical depth , kinetic temperature , and the column density itself .",
    "one final point is that elaborate non - lte radiative transfer models suggest that lte - derived co column densities can be underestimates of the true column densities by factors of 1.3 to 7 @xcite . as shown in the current paper , the assumption of lte can indeed underestimate the true column density ; similar factors are derived using much simpler two - component models that employ the lvg code .",

    "this implies a particular @xmath609 , which , in turn , implies a particular @xmath586 .",
    "these are placed in equations ( [ ape14a ] ) and ( [ ape14b ] ) to compute the variations induced at the data point , @xmath610 and @xmath611 .",
    "these , in turn , are used in equations ( [ ape15a ] ) and ( [ ape15b ] ) to compute the desired derivatives . in the special cases where @xmath612 and @xmath613 , @xmath614 and @xmath615 , respectively , which can be verified geometrically and do _",

    "the two - component lvg model is trivial .",
    "the definitions of the @xmath568 are now the seven parameters of the two - component models , instead of the three parameters shown in equations ( [ ape4a ] ) , ( [ ape4b ] ) , and ( [ ape4c ] ) .",
    "as stated in section  [ ssec33 ] , the column density of molecular gas derived from the continuum observations is derived from expression  ( [ mr39 ] ) , which is written here as @xmath616 where @xmath617 is the observed column density , @xmath157 , @xmath618 is the factor multiplying @xmath281 , and @xmath619 is @xmath281 .",
    "the @xmath569 are defined as appendix  [ appe ] , except that @xmath620 is now @xmath264 .",
    "the @xmath568 are the seven parameters that specify each model curve for the two - component models ( see section  [ ssec33 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath618 is analogous to the @xmath567 in appendix  [ appe ] .",
    "consequently , the uncertainty derivation is very similar to that in appendix  [ appe ] .",
    "the only other expression needed is that for @xmath619 .",
    "this can be in the wien limit for simplicity , as was done in section  [ ssec21 ] and appendix  [ appd ] .",
    "specifically , equation  ( [ apd1 ] ) is now written as @xmath621 as in appendix  [ appe ] , taking partial derivatives of @xmath617 with respect to the @xmath568 and @xmath569 is necessary .",
    "consequently , we use the following :      taking the partial derivatives of @xmath617 with respect to the @xmath568 and @xmath569 and adding them as in equation  ( [ ape6 ] ) gives @xmath623x^2 \\ + \\",

    "the partial derivatives of @xmath618 were determined using the same approach as for the partial derivatives of @xmath567 in appendix  [ appe ] .",
    "expression  ( [ apf4 ] ) was used to give the uncertainties in the derived @xmath157 values for the two - component models .",

    "<S> determining temperatures in molecular clouds from ratios of co rotational lines or from ratios of continuum emission in different wavelength bands suffers from reduced temperature sensitivity in the high - temperature limit . in theory </S>",
    "<S> , the ratio of far - ir , submillimeter , or millimeter continuum to that of a @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) rotational line can place reliable upper limits on the temperature of the dust and molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , far - infrared continuum data from the _ cobe_/_dirbe _ instrument and nagoya 4-m @xmath2 spectral line data were used to plot 240@xmath3/@xmath2 intensity ratios against 140@xmath3/240@xmath3 dust color temperatures , allowing us to constrain the multiparsec - scale physical conditions in the orion@xmath4a and b molecular clouds .    </S>",
    "<S> the best - fitting models to the orion clouds consist of two components : a component near the surface of the clouds that is heated primarily by a very large - scale ( i.e. @xmath5kpc ) interstellar radiation field and a component deeper within the clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the former has a fixed temperature and the latter has a range of temperatures that varies from one sightline to another . </S>",
    "<S> the models require a dust - gas temperature difference of 0@xmath6k and suggest that 40 - 50% of the orion clouds are in the form of dust and gas with temperatures between 3 and 10@xmath4k . </S>",
    "<S> these results have a number implications that are discussed in detail in later papers . </S>",
    "<S> these include stronger dust - gas thermal coupling and higher galactic - scale molecular gas temperatures than are usually accepted , an improved explanation for the n(h@xmath7)/i(co ) conversion factor , and ruling out one dust grain alignment mechanism . </S>"
