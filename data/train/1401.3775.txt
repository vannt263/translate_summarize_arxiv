    "stellar bars are effective drivers of secular evolution in disk galaxies .",
    "the rotation of bars couples to the motion of galactic material , creating characteristic rings and dense central regions @xcite , and redistributing angular momentum between the disk and dark matter halo @xcite . as a result of this redistribution bars can grow in strength , becoming increasingly efficient at funnelling gas towards central regions where starbursts may occur @xcite and the formation of bulges or pseudo - bulges",
    "may be augmented @xcite .    in terms of bar - driven radial gas inflows and their influence on star formation , chemical enrichment , and bulge formation , spectroscopic studies of galaxy centres",
    "are of key importance .",
    "such studies have shown that barred spiral galaxies have enhanced star formation rates relative to their unbarred counterparts @xcite . with regards to central metallicities ,",
    "conflicting results have been obtained .",
    "for instance , @xcite find similar stellar metallicities for barred and unbarred galaxies , whilst @xcite report higher metallicities in barred galaxies .",
    "thus , the question of whether bars influence chemical enrichment in galaxy centres is a matter of debate . while studies of central stellar ages are few and mostly limited by small samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite present stellar population analyses for a statistical sample which includes all disk galaxy types .",
    "they measure , at a significance level of @xmath8@xmath9 , that barred galaxies have on average younger central stellar populations than unbarred galaxies ; evidence for bars playing an important role in the building of bulges .",
    "the question of how the formation and evolution of bars are affected by environment is also the subject of debate .",
    "for example , some numerical simulations show that fly - by tidal interactions of the type found in dense clusters should be able to induce bars for specific orbital configurations @xcite , while other studies suggest that fast , frequent and weak galaxy encounters can dynamically heat disks , making them less prone to the disk instabilities which lead to bar formation @xcite .",
    "observations of bars in the extremely dense environments of cluster cores , and comparison with lower density environments , can therefore provide valuable information in helping understand the relative contributions of internal and external processes to the dynamical evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "most observational studies find weak to no variation of bars across environments of varying density @xcite .",
    "one study to report a significant bar - environment correlation is that of @xcite , whose result that barred galaxies are more likely to be found in denser environments is significant at the @xmath10 level .",
    "at least half of their measured correlation is contributed to by colour - environment and stellar mass - environment dependences , as opposed to the direct influence of environmental processes .",
    "some studies suggest a radial increase in the bar fraction towards the dense cores of clusters @xcite , but such results are limited by small samples .",
    "recent studies have investigated correlations between bars and many other galaxy properties ; luminosity , colour , effective radius , central velocity dispersion , stellar mass , bulge - to - total ratio , hubble type and redshift ( recent examples include * ? ? ?",

    "as a relevant example , @xcite find that lenticulars , i.e. s0 galaxies , have a mean bar fraction less than that of spiral galaxies , and @xcite measure considerably weaker bars in lenticulars than in spirals .    in this paper",

    "lenticulars are the dominant morphological galaxy type in the cores of nearby rich clusters such as coma @xcite .",
    "this relatively large abundance of lenticulars , and a high central galaxy density make coma an excellent laboratory for studying the environmental dependence of bars .    in order to develop and test techniques for bar detection and characterisation ,",
    "we perform detailed structural analyses of @xmath2 s0 galaxies within the central @xmath11 ( @xmath12  mpc ) radius region of coma .",
    "we also analyse a control sample of @xmath3 s0 galaxies that are associated with coma but lie @xmath8@xmath13  mpc from the cluster core .",

    "we use the two - dimensional ( 2d ) profile fitting algorithm galfit @xcite to decompose galaxy images into bulge , disk and bar components .",
    "first , we verify our method by performing bulge+disk+bar decompositions for a sample of artificial galaxies .",
    "we use this artificial galaxy fitting to determine a magnitude limit for the successful recovery of parameters , and investigate the residual flux fraction ( @xmath14 ) goodness - of - fit parameter @xcite as a quantitative bar detection parameter .",
    "second , we perform decompositions of our s0 samples",
    ". we subsequently present results for the dependence of the bar fraction ( @xmath15 ) , bar probability ( @xmath16 ) , and bar strength ( @xmath17 ) on environment and on galaxy properties . to study the influence of bars on central stellar metallicities and ages , we compare our bar analysis with the spectroscopic measurements of @xcite .",
    "we interpret the results in the context of bar - driven gas inflows .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we describe our methodology for bar detection and characterisation , including the image decomposition procedure ( section [ fitting_routine ] ) and bar detection criteria ( section [ bar_criteria ] ) .",

    ", the maximum ellipticity @xmath26 can be used as a basic parameter for bar strength .",
    "more recently bar measurement has been achieved using bulge+disk+bar decomposition @xcite , which involves the 2d modelling of galaxy light distributions with bulge , disk and bar components .",
    "examples of code designed to fit such components include galfit @xcite and budda @xcite .",
    "the method yields many structural parameters , including bar ellipticity @xmath26 and bar light fraction @xmath27 , each of which is a partial measure of bar strength . as such",
    ", @xmath28 can be used as a combined , quantitative measure of bar strength @xcite . in this work",
    ", we adopt this bulge+disk+bar decomposition method as a means of detecting and characterising bars .",
    "we use the 2d surface fitting routine galfit , developed by @xcite , to perform bulge+disk+bar decomposition .",
    "galfit is a non - linear , least - squares fitting algorithm that uses the levenberg - marquardt algorithm to find @xmath29 minima , given initial parameter guesses . in our implementation , we provide galfit with a pre - calculated sky background component , fitting region specifications , a psf image for convolution with the model , an external object or bad pixel mask file , and a sigma image ( noise map ) .",
    "we use pre - calculated sigma images , having found that they produce slightly more reliable results when fitting artificial galaxy images than those automatically generated by galfit .",
    "we employ an iterative procedure which follows that of @xcite , whereby structural components are successively added to the galfit model .",

    "initial parameter estimates do not need to be precise at this stage as galfit easily converges on a solution .",
    "2 .   bulge+disk fit : to the single srsic ( bulge ) component we add an exponential disk component with a radial profile of : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the central surface brightness and @xmath37 is the scale length of the disk , related to the effective radius through the relationship @xmath38 .",
    "a bulge+disk fit is performed , with the disk axial ratio [ @xmath39 and position angle ( @xmath40 ) set to values measured using the iraf task ` ellipse ` .",
    "3 .   bulge+disk+bar fit : to the bulge+disk model we add a low index ( @xmath41 ) srsic component representing a bar .",
    "initial guesses for @xmath42 and @xmath43 are deduced using ` ellipse ` . after this bulge+disk+bar fit",
    "is performed , the @xmath44 and @xmath40 parameters are freed such that galfit may reach a stable solution .      to determine a suitable magnitude limit for sample selection ,",
    "we investigated the optimum signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath45 ) at which bar parameters can be reliably measured using the galfit decomposition procedure outlined in section [ fitting_routine ] .",
    "first , we fitted noise - added model sb0 galaxy images designed to mimic sdss dr8 @xmath0-band data in terms of resolution and @xmath45 range . in general , galfit bar parameters failed to be recovered below @xmath46 .",
    "second , we applied the decomposition procedure to @xmath47 model sb0 galaxies with @xmath48 ; @xmath49 of which have @xmath50 and @xmath49 of which have @xmath51 . to determine",
    "how well the @xmath27 parameter is recovered at @xmath48 , we calculated the ratio of the best - fit value of @xmath27 to the original model value ( fit / model ) for each individual galaxy , and subsequently the overall standard deviation of fit / model ( @xmath52 ) . for @xmath51 an acceptable scatter of @xmath53 was measured , but for @xmath50 a high scatter of @xmath54 supports that @xmath48 is an appropriate signal - to - noise limit for sample selection .",
    "this corresponds to a magnitude limit of @xmath55 for sdss @xmath0-band data .      in our analysis",
    "we require that the following three criteria are satisfied for a galaxy to be classified as barred :    1 .",
    "[ visual_residual ] a bar must be visually identified in the srsic and bulge+disk model subtracted image residuals that is removed when a bar is added to the model .",
    "clearly , identifying such signatures by eye is a subjective method . to address this issue ,",
    "we have generated a large set of artificial galaxy images with and without bars , and analysed these following the procedure outlined in section [ fitting_routine ] .",
    "the best - fit model subtracted residual images provide a reference set for visual comparison to real galaxy residual images .",
    "some example residual images for single srsic fits are displayed in fig .",
    "[ residual_comb_diagram ] , where galaxies have been arranged according to their @xmath56 and @xmath27 values .",
    "the diagram only shows results for one set of bulge and disk parameters and is not intended to cover the complete range of possible residual signatures , but to give an idea of typical bar signatures and how these can be expected to vary with bar strength . in an additional simplification @xmath57 and",
    "@xmath40 have been set equal , which is often not a good approximation for barred galaxies .",
    "the bar produces a distinctive pattern in the residual images .",
    "+    2 .   [ sensible_parameters ]",
    "best - fit parameters must take on sensible values for the bulge+disk+bar fit to be accepted , i.e. they must lie within typical parameter ranges and not converge to unreasonably high or low values .",
    "for example , a bulge+disk+bar fit will only be accepted if @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the lower limit corresponding to a pseudo - bulge @xcite .",
    "3 .   for the third criterion",
    ", we define a bar detection parameter ( @xmath60 ) that quantifies the change in image residuals between the bulge+disk and bulge+disk+bar fitting stages , thereby increasing objectivity .",
    "+ the residual flux fraction ( @xmath61 ) measures the fraction of the image residuals which can not be accounted for by noise , and is defined by @xcite as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the modulus of the remaining pixel value after subtraction of the best - fit model from the original image , the summation of which is over all pixels within the galaxy iso - area .",
    "@xmath64 is the image variance , and flux_iso is the total flux of the iso - area . for the iso - area",
    "we use the area of the moments ellipse as defined by sextractor @xcite .",
    "a very small or negative @xmath61 is interpreted as over - fitting .",
    "@xcite find that an @xmath61 of greater than @xmath65 justifies the addition of further model components .",
    "our bulge+disk and bulge+disk+bar results very rarely exceed this fraction , and there is always at least a small decrease in @xmath61 as model components are added . as such , the change in @xmath61 between the bulge+disk and bulge+disk+bar image residuals ( @xmath66 ) was instead investigated as a parameter for indicating whether a galaxy is likely to be barred or unbarred .",
    "+ to gauge typical @xmath66 values for barred and unbarred lenticulars ( sb0s and s0s , respectively ) , we fitted @xmath67 artificial galaxy images ( @xmath68 of each type ) , designed to mimic our sdss sample in terms of @xmath45 range , resolution , and the physical properties ( light fractions , effective radii , axis ratios and srsic indices ) of the morphological components .",

    "[ delta_rff_histograms]_b _ ) .",

    "we adopt a bar detection threshold of @xmath69 , since @xmath70 of the model sb0s lie above , and @xmath71 of the model s0s lie below this value .",
    "thus , our third bar detection criterion is that @xmath66 must be greater than @xmath72 for a galaxy to be classified as barred .",
    "+   for barred and unbarred lenticulars ( sb0s and s0s , respectively ) , using both : ( a ) model galaxy images , and ( b ) sdss galaxy images with visually identified bars . since @xmath70 of the model sb0s have @xmath66 greater than @xmath72",
    ", we use this as a threshold for bar detection ( see section [ bar_criteria]).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      fitting artificial galaxies is an important step in assessing our bar detection method .",
    "we applied the decomposition procedure in section [ fitting_routine ] and the bar detection criteria in section [ bar_criteria ] to @xmath67 model galaxy images , @xmath68 s0s and @xmath68 sb0s , designed to mimic our real galaxy sample in terms of @xmath45 and morphological properties ( for a similar analysis , see section 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "our method efficiently identifies bars , with @xmath73 of the model sb0s correctly identified as barred , and only @xmath74 incorrectly identified as unbarred . of the model s0s ,",
    "@xmath75 were correctly identified as unbarred , and @xmath76 were incorrectly identified as barred . as such , the bar fractions given in section [ results ] may be lower limits .",
    "we study exclusively lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies in the coma cluster using @xmath0-band images from the sdss dr8 .",
    "as noted in section [ introduction ] , the bar fraction and bar properties have been shown to vary significantly with hubble type .",
    "the abundance of s0s in coma thus allows a statistically robust sample of one specific disk - galaxy type , removing selection effects caused by this variation .",
    "additionally , the lack of spiral features in s0s makes them well suited to our bar detection method ( see @xcite for a review of the photometric components of s0s )",
    ".    comparisons of bars between different density environments often consider results from separate studies .",
    "this may limit the conclusions from any measured bar - environment correlation as bar definitions tend to be based on measurable parameters associated with the specific method used , and the number of detectable bars increases significantly with @xmath45 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "cluster membership was determined using sdss dr8 spectroscopic redshifts and the caustic pattern calculated by @xcite .",
    "a colour cut was made of @xmath79 , corresponding to the red sequence .",

    "this reduced the sample to @xmath85 galaxies .",
    "the ` ellipse ` isophote fitting method can fail in the case of highly inclined galaxies with extended , spheroidal stellar components , which cause @xmath21 to be measured as less than @xmath86 for outer isophotes .",
    "three such galaxies were rejected after being identified through the spurious detection of an extremely strong bar by galfit , the visual identification of a diffuse stellar component , and the equal position angle of disk and stellar components .",
    "a preliminary application of our decomposition procedure to sdss images revealed that reliable parameter measurements could not be obtained by galfit fainter than a magnitude of @xmath8@xmath87 . as such , the upper @xmath88 limit of the sample",
    "was lowered from @xmath89 to @xmath87 , decreasing the sample to @xmath90 galaxies .",

    "visual classifications were then performed , referring to these representative samples and cross - checking with other morphological classifications @xcite where possible .",
    "after our type classifications , a clear decision between e and s0 was not possible for a small number of fainter e / s0s ; although strongly - barred s0s are easily identifiable , it is more difficult to distinguish between unbarred s0s and ellipticals . as such",
    ", there may be a few unidentified unbarred s0s not included in the sample , and the s0 bar fractions quoted in this study may therefore be upper limits .",
    "this morphological selection leaves @xmath91 lenticular galaxies . after the discarding of a further six galaxies due to contamination by adjacent bright stars or companion galaxies ,",

    "magnitude , inclination and hubble type cuts as described above for the central sample , along with rejections due to contamination , resulted in an outskirts sample of @xmath3 s0s . unlike the central sample , these outskirts galaxies lie well outside the virial radius of coma and are unlikely to have visited the central region or experienced significant cluster interactions .",
