    "the milky way galaxy s most massive globular cluster , @xmath2 centauri , harbours a large star - to - star variation in metallicity , [ fe / h ] = @xmath3 , spanning at least a factor of 10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the light ,",
    "@xmath4- , fe - peak and slow neutron - capture process ( @xmath5-process ) elements , @xmath2 cen also exhibits a complex distribution in abundance ratios and [ x / fe ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "that is , @xmath2 cen has experienced a complex chemical enrichment history and has retained ejecta from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars as well as from type ia and type ii supernovae @xcite . in contrast , the majority of galactic globular clusters do not exhibit star - to - star variations in metallicity beyond the measurement uncertainties ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at present",
    ", arguably the most plausible explanation for @xmath2 cen is that it is the surviving nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "as recently as 2007 , @xmath2 centauri was the only globular cluster for which there was undisputed evidence for a metallicity variation . within the past few years , however , abundance dispersions in fe - peak and/or @xmath5-process elements have been reported in a number of globular clusters including ngc 1851 @xcite , m 22 @xcite , terzan 5 @xcite , m 54 @xcite , m 75 @xcite , ngc 5824 @xcite , m 2 @xcite and ngc 5286 @xcite .",
    "( results for some of these clusters have been challenged by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "it was recognised that these objects ( along with @xmath2 cen ) , are preferentially among the most luminous ( i.e. , massive ) of the galaxy s globular clusters , and that many have an extended horizontal branch with extremely blue stars @xcite .",
    "some , if not all , of these objects could be the remnants of dwarf galaxies @xcite . in particular ,",
    "m 54 is currently the nuclear star cluster of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dsph ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that when the sgr dsph is tidally disrupted , the compact remnant of the m 54+sgr system will resemble @xmath2 cen .",
    "therefore , the identification of additional globular clusters with intrinsic abundance dispersions in fe - peak elements may have important consequences for our understanding of galactic evolution . in order to complete the characterisation of the galactic globular cluster system and",
    "possibly identify new clusters with abundance dispersions in fe - peak elements , the most promising candidates to investigate are the most luminous globular clusters with extended blue horizontal branches .",
    "ngc 6273 ( m 19 ) has an extended blue horizontal branch and with @xmath6 = @xmath79.1 , it is the 10th most luminous galactic globular cluster ( * ? ? ?",
    "* updated december 2010 ) and lies near the galactic bulge .",
    "proper - motion analysis indicates that it is an inner halo globular cluster @xcite .",
    "observations by ( * ? ? ?",

    "j15 found a `` metal - poor '' population ( 9 stars , @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath9 = @xmath71.75 ) , a `` metal - rich '' population ( 8 stars , @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath9 = @xmath71.51 ) and one `` anomalous '' star with [ fe / h ] = @xmath71.30 .",
    "the `` metal - rich '' population had enhanced ratios of the @xmath5-process element la compared to the `` metal - poor '' population , @xmath8[la / fe]@xmath9 = + 0.16 and @xmath8[la / fe]@xmath9 = + 0.48 , respectively .",

    "we also include comparison globular clusters from @xcite .",
    "of the 21 stars in common with j15 , eight have metallicities from j15 and we overplot those objects as large filled triangles .",
    "of those eight objects , three are from the `` metal - poor '' population ( blue ) , four are from the `` metal - rich '' population ( red ) and the sole `` anomalous '' star is included ( aqua ) .",
    "we caution that for five of these eight stars in common with j15 , we were unable to measure equivalent widths for the 8542  and 8662  lines in both spectra ( 8550  and 8600 ) .",
    "therefore we were unable to compare @xmath16 between the 8550  and 8600  spectra and so the @xmath16 measurements for those five stars may have larger errors than for the 42 program stars .",
    "we will comment on these stars later in this section .",
    "following @xcite , we use the @xmath12 magnitude rather than the @xmath25 magnitude in figure [ fig : cat ] .",
    "the advantages to this approach are that extinction and differential reddening in the @xmath12 band are much lower when compared to the @xmath25 band .",
    "additionally , the relatively flat slope of the @xmath16 vs.  @xmath12(hb)@xmath26 relation ( @xmath70.385 / mag compared to @xmath70.63 / mag for the optical relation ) means that errors arising from photometry , distance and/or reddening will have a smaller impact upon the derived metallicities .    to obtain metallicities",
    ", we adopted the approach of @xcite and assumed the relation @xmath16 = 0.385[@xmath12(hb ) @xmath7 @xmath12 ] + @xmath28 .",
    "for each star , we can then obtain the reduced equivalent width , @xmath28 .",
    "for the 42 stars shown in figure [ fig : cat ] , we find an average reduced equivalent width of @xmath29 = 3.86 @xmath20 0.07  ( @xmath21 = 0.42 ) .",
    "note that the standard deviation of 0.42  can not be attributed entirely to the difference in @xmath16 measured from the two different settings , 8550  and 8600 , nor to the uncertainties in @xmath16 ( the average uncertainty is 0.19 @xmath20 0.01 ) .",
    "therefore , there is an intrinsic spread in @xmath16 , i.e. , caii  line strengths , in ngc 6273 .    to convert the reduced equivalent widths into metallicities , we use the following relation from @xcite which is calibrated by the observed line strengths in standard globular clusters with metallicities on the @xcite abundance scale : [ fe / h ] = @xmath74.61 + 1.842@xmath30 @xmath7 0.4428@xmath29@xmath31 + 0.04517@xmath29@xmath32 . using this calibration",
    ", we obtain an average metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath71.48 @xmath20 0.03 ( @xmath21 = 0.21 ) .",
    "we plot the metallicity distribution in figure [ fig : feh ] , upper panel , as a generalised histogram in which each data point is represented by a unit gaussian of width 0.10 dex .",
    "( the average error in [ fe / h ] is close to 0.10 dex ) .",
    "cen ( lower panel , data from @xcite , see text for details ) .",
    "the second panel includes all stars from j15 but with metallicities shifted by + 0.20 dex ( see text for details ) .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion is written in each panel ( see text for details ) as well as the number of stars .",
    "[ fig : feh ] ]    we now seek to quantify the abundance dispersion .",
    "for the 42 program stars , the standard deviation for @xmath28 is 0.42  and the average error is 0.19 .",
    "when taking into account the error , the intrinsic spread in @xmath28 is therefore @xmath00.38 . at the metallicity of ngc 6273 ,",
    "that intrinsic spread in reduced equivalent width translates into an intrinsic abundance spread of @xmath1[fe / h ] = 0.17 dex .",
    "we therefore confirm the results of j15 who reported a very similar value of @xmath21[fe / h ] = 0.16 dex and an average metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath71.62 .    in order to select stars with reliable calcium triplet line strength measurements ,",
    "we required @xmath16 to be in good agreement between the 8550  and 8600  observations ; @xmath17@xmath33 @xmath13 0.6as seen in figure [ fig : caterrsn ] .",
    "had we adopted a more stringent cutoff of @xmath17@xmath33 @xmath13 0.4 , our results and conclusions would be essentially unchanged : for the 34 stars that meet that criterion , the standard deviation in @xmath28 is 0.46  and the average error in @xmath16 is 0.17 , i.e. , the dispersion in @xmath28 can not be explained by errors in @xmath16 alone .",
    "instead , the intrinsic spread in @xmath28 is 0.42  and this translates into an intrinsic abundance spread of @xmath1[fe / h ] = 0.19 dex .",
    "ngc 6273 suffers from large and variable reddening , @xmath34 = 0.32 and @xmath35 @xmath0 0.3 @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that differential reddening is responsible ( in part or in whole ) for the dispersion in @xmath28 and metallicity dispersion . to check this possibility",
    ", we used the differential reddening map for ngc 6273 from @xcite . for each program star , we averaged the differential reddening values within 5 arcsec .",
    "the average value was @xmath36 = 0.015 @xmath20 0.006 ( @xmath21 = 0.068 ) with minimum and maximum values of @xmath70.100 and 0.174 .",
    "assuming @xmath37 = 0.34@xmath34 , the standard deviation in @xmath28 is unchanged and therefore , differential reddening as high as @xmath36 = @xmath00.27 does not affect the derived metallicities . as noted , using the @xmath12 magnitude rather than the @xmath25 magnitude greatly reduces the effect of differential reddening and the slope of the @xmath16 vs.  @xmath12(hb)@xmath7@xmath12 relation is flatter than the corresponding optical trend .",
    "recall that we also observed eight stars with metallicities from j15 . for five of these objects , however , we could not measure the equivalent widths for 8542  and 8662  in both spectra . while their @xmath16 measurements may have larger uncertainties , we can obtain metallicities and compare our values with j15 ( see table [ tab : j15 ] ) .",
    "the average difference is @xmath38[fe / h ] = 0.20 @xmath20 0.07 ( @xmath21 = 0.20 dex ) , with our values being higher than those of j15 . on our abundance scale ,",
    "the three `` metal - poor '' stars and four `` metal - rich '' stars from j15 have average metallicities of [ fe / h ] = @xmath71.49 and [ fe / h ] = @xmath71.42 , respectively .",

    ", we combine our program stars with all stars from j15 but we shift their metallicities by + 0.20 dex to match our scale .",
    "the upper two panels exhibit very similar abundance distributions .",
    "that is , including or excluding the j15 stars does not affect our results , namely , that there is an intrinsic abundance dispersion in ngc 6273 .",

    "@xcite found that when using surface gravities based on photometry , the [ feii / h ] distribution exhibits no spread .",
    "they suggested that neglect of non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects can produce spurious abundance spreads . for m 22 , however , there is also a real spread in caii  line strengths @xcite which , if not due to metallicity variations , requires an unknown explanation .",

    "we consider the abundance spreads in m 22 as real given the concordance between the high dispersion results and the caii  results for this cluster and that the differential nlte corrections are expected to be negligible .",
    "the increase in @xmath5-process element abundances with increasing metallicity is a characteristic shared by @xmath2 cen , m 22 , m 2 , ngc 5286 and ngc 6273 and requires contributions from type ii supernovae and agb stars .",
    "the presence of a third , `` anomalous '' , population at higher metallicity but without @xmath5-process element enhancements or light element abundance anomalies has only been identified in m 2 ( four stars ) and ngc 6273 ( one star ) . clearly , it would be of great interest to examine chemical abundances for a larger suite of elements in the most metal - rich stars of ngc 6273 to establish whether the anomalous populations in these two globular clusters share common characteristics .",
    "it is worth noting that initial observations of the caii  triplet in the outer halo globular cluster ngc 2419 showed line strength variations @xcite .",
    "subsequent analyses , however , revealed that this cluster has a single metallicity , [ fe / h ] = @xmath412.1 , but is highly unusual in that it exhibits very large star - to - star variations for mg and k ( factors of @xmath0100 ) @xcite .",
    "mg is an important electron donor in low mass stars ( and thus contributes to the h@xmath42 continuous opacity ) , and the large mg depletion combined with a small star - to - star ca variation could explain the behaviour of the caii  triplet lines in ngc 2419 @xcite .",
    "a similar explanation could possibly also apply to ngc 5824 @xcite . for ngc 6273 ,",
    "however , the calcium line strength variation is larger than in ngc 2419 and ngc 5824 , the mg variation is relatively modest ( @xmath38[mg / fe ] @xmath43 0.5 ; j15 ) and the overall metallicity is higher .",
    "so it seems unlikely that star - to - star mg variations are driving the calcium line strength variations in ngc 6273 .",
    "we reiterate that the most plausible explanation for the origin of @xmath2 cen is that it is the surviving nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that when the sgr dsph is tidally disrupted by the milky way , the remnant of the m 54+sgr system may closely resemble @xmath2 cen @xcite . since @xmath2 cen , m 54 and ngc 6273 all exhibit an intrinsic abundance dispersion , it is tempting to suggest that they may all share a similar formation mechanism as the remnant nuclei of disrupted dwarf galaxies .",
    "if this is the case , then one might expect to find a diffuse stellar envelope ( and/or extratidal stars ) surrounding ngc 6273 as is the case for other globular clusters that exhibit abundance dispersions in fe - peak and/or @xmath5-process elements including ngc 1851 @xcite , ngc 5824 @xcite , m 2 ( @xcite , kuzma et al .  in prep ) and m 22 @xcite .",
    "identifying such a stellar halo will be challenging given that ngc 6273 lies near the galactic bulge and has large and variable reddening , @xmath34 = 0.32 and @xmath36 @xmath0 0.3 @xcite .    finally , two ( @xmath2 cen and m 22 ) of the clusters previously known to exhibit variations of the heavy elements ca and/or fe are also known to exhibit very large variations in cyanogen and to exhibit large ellipticities ( see @xcite ) , @xcite ) may result from projection effects . ] .",
    "we note then that ngc 6273 exhibits the largest ellipticity of the galactic globular cluster population ( @xmath44 , @xcite ) . from narrowband",
    "ca photometry , @xcite identified a ca - rich and ca - poor population in ngc 6273 and measured the cn and ch line strength indices in each population .",
    "they found that the ca - rich population was also enhanced in cn , which is similar to @xmath2 cen and m 22 @xcite .",
    "we confirm that the globular cluster ngc 6273 harbours an intrinsic abundance spread based on intermediate resolution gmos - s spectra of the line strengths of the caii  triplet features . the intrinsic abundance dispersion",
    ", @xmath45[fe / h ] = 0.17 agrees with the results from j15 , @xmath21[fe / h ] = 0.16 .",
    "ngc 6273 therefore has the third largest abundance dispersion after @xmath2 cen and m 54 among the galactic globular clusters .",
    "the total range in metallicity is @xmath01.0 dex .",
    "we confirm the presence of a high metallicity tail with values reaching above [ fe / h ] = @xmath71.0 and perhaps up to [ fe / h ] = @xmath70.70 .",
