    "there is considerable interest in understanding how stochastic behaviour emerges from deterministic systems , both in the mathematics and applications literature .",
    "a simple mechanism for emergent stochastic behaviour is via homogenization of multiscale systems , see for example  @xcite .",
    "recently , melbourne & stuart  @xcite embarked on a programme to develop a rigorous theory of homogenization based on new ideas in the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "the aim is to avoid excessive mixing assumptions on the fast dynamics , since these are very difficult to establish even for uniformly hyperbolic ( axiom a or anosov ) flows ( general references for the ergodic theory of uniformly hyperbolic maps and flows include  @xcite ) .",
    "instead , the theory relies only on relatively mild statistical properties that are known to hold very widely and are independent of mixing assumptions ( see  @xcite or remark  [ rmk - young ] below for further details ) .    the mechanism for emergent stochastic behaviour in deterministic systems , whereby fast chaotic dynamics induces white noise in the slow variables , is much - studied in the applied literature , see for example  @xcite .",
    "see also the program outlined by  @xcite .",
    "the aim here , continuing and extending the work in  @xcite , is to obtain rigorous results for large classes of fast - slow systems under unusually mild assumptions .",
    "in particular ,  @xcite studied fast - slow odes of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "it is assumed that the vector fields @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 satisfy certain regularity conditions and that the fast @xmath7 dynamics possesses a compact attractor @xmath8 with ergodic invariant probability measure @xmath9 satisfying certain mild chaoticity assumptions . finally , it is required that @xmath10 so that we are in the situation of homogenization rather than averaging .",
    "the conclusion  @xcite is that @xmath11 in @xmath12 as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the solution to a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) of the form @xmath15 here @xmath16 is unit @xmath17-dimensional brownian motion and @xmath18 .",

    "the assumption that @xmath59 is nonvanishing means that we can write @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a monotone differentiable function . by a change of variables , @xmath62 , it is then possible to reduce to the situation where there is no multiplicative noise , see sections  [ sec - mult_flows ] and  [ sec - mult_map ] . in the process",
