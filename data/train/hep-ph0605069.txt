    "it is generally considered that a full understanding of the masses and associated mixings of the quarks and leptons is one of the chief unsolved problems in elementary particle physics .",
    "while a great deal of experimental knowledge about quark masses and mixings has been available for quite a long time , it is only in the last few years that very detailed information on lepton masses and mixings has been found from a series of remarkable experiments involving neutrino oscillations ( see for some examples , refs ) .",
    "these results can be expected to provide valuable clues toward the solution of this mass and mixing problem .",
    "one such clue is the fact that the leptonic mixing matrix is now known to be somewhat close to what is called the `` tribimaximal '' form ; actually a number of interesting discussions of this form have been presented over a period of years . for immediate convenience",
    "this form may be read from eq.([r ] ) below and it can be seen that one column has three equal entries while another has two entries of equal magnitude with the third zero . such a structure is natural in the context of permutation symmetry since it is a characteristic one which brings the basis of the defining representation of @xmath0 ( the permutation group on three objects ) to the basis in which it is decomposed into two and one dimensional irreducible pieces . of course",
    ", @xmath0 is natural in the context of the standard model of elementary particles , which contains three parallel families of fermions .",
    "it has also been often discussed in the literature .",
    "however , it seems that this symmetry can not be exact ; otherwise there would be two exactly degenerate neutrinos , which is not the case .",
    "it is possible that the situation may be analogous to another three flavor theory- the old @xmath1 model in which the three flavors turned out to represent the u , d and s quarks rather than the three families we now know about .",
    "an initial @xmath1 flavor symmetry for the then unknown strong interaction hamiltonian was assumed to be broken , according to the gell mann okubo hypothesis @xcite , as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is @xmath1 invariant and @xmath5 breaks the symmetry , leaving the iso - spin subgroup invariant .",
    "actually , another symmetry breaking term , which breaks the iso - spin subgroup but preserves a different @xmath6 subgroup is also required . a possible analogy to the @xmath0 symmetry case might be to postulate that the standard electroweak lagrangian density has a decomposition like @xmath7 where , on the right hand side , the first term is assumed to be @xmath0 invariant , the second term only preserves one @xmath8 subgroup of @xmath0 and the third term preserves a different @xmath8 subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "there is a presumption that the first term is the dominant one .    in the present paper",
    "we will concentrate on the fully @xmath0 invariant term , @xmath9 of eq.([s3breaker ] ) .",
    "we must specify what are the first approximation fermion masses and the first approximation mixing matrices for which we are aiming . in the cases of the charged leptons and the up and down quarks , the first approximation to the masses",
    "is conventionally taken to mean assigning the heaviest fermion of each of the three families ( @xmath10 ) a non - zero mass and setting the masses of the others to zero .",
    "considering that the quark ckm angles are all small it seems reasonable to consider the charged fermion mixing matrices be just the unit matrices in first approximation . on the other hand we would like to take the tribimaximal form as the first @xmath0 invariant approximation to the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the question of what is a good first approximation to the spectrum of neutrino masses is perhaps not so clear .",
    "we will argue that an approximately degnerate neutrino spectrum is the most reasonable choice .",
    "our job will be to demonstrate that the same @xmath0 symmetry can give rise to different patterns of masses and mixings for the electrically charged fermions and the neutrinos .    in this paper we will work completely in the framework of the electroweak theory , postponing any possible inclusion in a grand unified theory .",
    "we will assume only a minimal number of fermion fields so that the neutrinos will be initially taken to be majorana type .",
    "on the other hand we wo nt fully specify the higgs fields in advance .",
    "we will also show that the model can be modified for the case of dirac neutrinos .    in section ii we will give the needed notation for the fermion fields and",
    "shall show how the permutation group , @xmath0 may act on them .",
    "section iii first contains a discussion of the form of the neutrino mass matrix under the assumption of @xmath0 invariance .",
    "it is shown how it can be diagonalized by a matrix which is , up to a diagonal phase matrix and a possible rotation in a two dimensional subspace , the same as the tribimaximal form .",
    "then , an argument is given that the largest part of the solution space for the three neutrino masses derived from the known mass differences corresponds to almost complete degeneracy .",
    "also in section iii , we note that this can easily be achieved by making use of the freedom to have complex constants in the mass matrix .",
    "this results in a physical majorana phase in the mixing matrix when the neutrinos are introduced as majorana particles .",
    "section iv contains a discussion of the mass matrix of the charged leptons when it is assumed that these particles acquire mass using just the standard higgs field .",
    "there is no problem with the @xmath0 invariance allowing for a mass spectrum in which only the @xmath11 lepton is massive , as desired .",
    "however , there is a problem with getting a trivial charged lepton mixing matrix , as needed to realize the tribimaximal form for the overall lepton mixing matrix . to solve this problem one might imagine backing up and allowing various row and column permutations for both the neutrino and charged lepton mixing matrices ( there are 36 x 36 possibilities ) and possible two dimensional rotations in the two dimensional degenerate subspaces of each in the hope that the product comes out to be of tribimaximal form .",
    "this hope is not realized .",
    "we give a simple proof that the tribimaximal form can not be obtained in this manner .    in section",
    "v , we point out a possible alternative treatment of the charged lepton masses and mixings which seems able to give in the first approximation , the desired trivial mixing matrix and non - zero mass only for the tau lepton . instead of requiring the right handed charged leptons to transform under @xmath0 we consider them to be singlets under @xmath0 so that the relevant discrete group becomes just @xmath12 . to construct an @xmath0 invariant yukawa term with the higgs fields",
    "now requires that we introduce three different higgs doublets , one associated with each fermion family .",
    "furthermore , the higgs potential ( which may involve other possible higgs fields too ) should allow for spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath0 symmetry in order to obtain the desired mass spectrum and trivial mixing .",
    "as an application of the first approximation model with three approximately degenerate neutrinos we calculate , in this section , the leptonic factor for neutrinoless beta decay .",
    "it depends on the value of the degenerate neutrino masses and the single majorana phase in the model .",
    "the up and down quark masses and mixings are briefly discussed in section vi .",
    "since we want to have masses only for the b and t quarks and trivial mixing in first approximation we use exactly the same model for the yukawa terms as in the case of the charged leptons , just mentioned .",
    "note that only the left handed quark fields , not the right handed ones , are assigned to transform under @xmath0 . in section vii",
    ", we briefly discuss the form of the characteristic matrices which reflect the invariance under any @xmath8 subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "these may be considered as plausible perturbations to give higher approximations to this model .",
    "we count the number of parameters corresponding to the sum of the @xmath0 matrix and either one perturbation matrix or two perturbation matrices invariant under different @xmath8 subgroups . finally .",
    "section viii contains a brief summary and discussion .",

    "the hatted fields correspond to mass eigenstates and are related to the original ones as : @xmath22 here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are 3x3 unitary matrices .",
    "finally the leptonic mixing matrix is defined as @xmath25    it is clear that the part of the lagrangian given in eq.([firstl ] ) ( which seems to be the most securely established ) possesses a global @xmath26 symmetry- one @xmath27 symmetry for each term .",
    "subgroups of this very large group are candidates for extra symmetries which might be imposed when adding the higgs interaction terms and potential .",
    "discrete symmetries have the feature that they do not necessarily imply the existence of new goldstone bosons when spontaneous breakdown to @xmath28 occurs . the discrete symmetry which is staring us in the face",
    "is the generational permutation symmetry @xmath0 and has been discussed by many people .",
    "of course , there are a number of possibilities for implementing this symmetry",

    "nevertheless it may be a good first approximation and hence interesting to study in detail . that is the point of view we will take here .    in @xcite ,",
    "harrison and scott have argued that , even if one accepts the predicted two - fold degeneracy , the @xmath0 model is still not a good first approximation because the two degenerate masses belong to columns 1 and 3 rather than columns 1 and 2 .",
    "masses 1 and 2 are expected to be closer to each other because the solar neutrino mass difference is a lot smaller than the atmospheric neutrino mass difference . here",

    "the charged lepton masses may then arise from a term , @xmath149 where @xmath150 is a matrix of coupling constants whose form will be restricted by the @xmath12 symmetry ( the @xmath146 symmetry is not being implemented now ) .",
    "the charged lepton mass matrix is : @xmath151 so that the charged lepton mass term in the lagrangian looks conventional : @xmath152 as before , the @xmath12 invariance demands that the three matrices , @xmath153 have the forms : @xmath154 wherein the six quantities @xmath155 and @xmath156 are all undetermined complex numbers .",
    "then the predicted form for @xmath91 is : @xmath157 , \\label{bigme}\\ ] ] where we have denoted the sum of the three vacuum values as @xmath158 .",
    "our goal is to see if eq.([bigme ] ) can yield a mass spectrum with a single massive charged lepton and the unit matrix for @xmath24 , the charged lepton mixing matrix defined in eq.([uandw ] ) .",
    "this can be simply achieved if first , the three arbitrary constants @xmath159 are all set to zero together with the two arbitrary constants @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "second , since just the bottom row remains , we must have a spontaneous breakdown structure in the higgs potential which results in the vanishing of the expectation values @xmath162 and @xmath163 but not @xmath164 .",
    "the @xmath111 mass then becomes , in the first approximation limit , @xmath165 .",
    "the higgs potential appropriate for this model may be rather complicated since many additional higgs fields could very well be present .",
    "one characteristic term illustrating how a basic permutation invariant quadratic form appears is : @xmath166 \\left[\\phi_e^{\\dagger}(\\epsilon\\delta_{ef } + \\zeta{d_{ef}})\\phi_f - k_2\\right]^*+\\hspace{.15 in } \\cdots , \\label{higgsv}\\ ] ] where @xmath167,@xmath168,@xmath74 and @xmath169 are constants while @xmath170 stands for elements of the democratic matrix .",
    "so it seems that by using , instead of a single higgs doublet , three higgs doublets linked to the three leptonic families by @xmath12 invariance , we can obtain a suitable first approximation to the lepton mass spectrum and to the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath171 . specifically , the charged leptons have a trivial mixing matrix and only the heaviest one is massive . on the other hand , in this same approximation ,",
    "the three neutrino masses are approximately degenerate and have a mixing matrix which can be taken to be of the tribimaximal form , eq.([defineu ] ) or its generalization to include a rotation in the two dimensional degenerate subspace .    associated with this model in the case where the neutrinos are formulated as majorana particles , is the existence of the majorana phase @xmath172 defined in eq.([psi ] ) . to illustrate the importance of this cp violating majorana phase we calculate the characteristic leptonic factor @xmath173 for neutrinoless double beta decay in the present model with three approximately degenerate neutrinos having mass , @xmath174 .",
    "the general formula is : @xmath175 where the lepton mixing matrix elements are obtained by identifying @xmath60 with @xmath23 given in eqs.([defineu ] ) , ( [ pmatrix ] ) and ( [ r ] ) .",
    "this yields with @xmath74 negligible , @xmath176 it is easy to check that this result would not change if we computed the matrix elements @xmath177 using the rotated form of @xmath44 given in eq.([rotation ] ) rather than the one in eq.([r ] ) .",
    "clearly @xmath173 obeys the inequality , @xmath178 the present experimental bound on this quantity is @xcite , @xmath179 which is not much greater than the range of m for which the approximate degeneracy of all three neutrinos holds .",
    "thus this kind of model may be tested in the next few years .",
    "the up and down quark mass matrices clearly have a reasonable first approximation in which the heaviest of each is massive while the other two have no mass . in the same approximation",
    "it is reasonable to have a unit mixing matrix .",
    "then the situation for each is the same as for the charged leptons , as just discussed .",
    "it thus seems natural to use the same setup as for the charged leptons , with three higgs fields transforming under @xmath12 .",
    "the quark mass terms in the lagrangian would take the form , @xmath180 which yields the up and down quark mass matrices as : @xmath181 the predictions of @xmath0 invariance are @xmath182 as in the charged lepton case the first approximation to the quark mass spectrum yields , @xmath183 while the other quark masses remain zero .",
    "for completeness we mention that the up and down mass matrices in the general case are brought to diagonal forms by the bi - unitary transformations : @xmath184 this leads to the diagonal ( hatted ) states , @xmath185 and the hadronic part of the charged current weak interaction , @xmath186 here @xmath187 is the quark mixing ( or ckm ) matrix . in the first approximation under consideration @xmath188",
    "next let us briefly consider the perturbations which might be employed to improve the first approximation fermion spectra and mixing matrices .",
    "for this purpose , we first summarize the general form of the @xmath0 invariant matrices which appear in eqs .",
    "( [ solution ] ) , ( [ solveme ] ) , ( [ gc ] ) and ( [ aandb ] ) as : @xmath189 . \\label{s3type}\\ ] ] this matrix contains two complex parameters . as we have seen the non - reality plays an important role in obtaining the proposed first approximation to the neutrino mass spectrum",
    "of course , the parameters will be different for fermions of each electric charge .",
    "the assumption of a grand unified theory would give additional relations among them .",
    "note also that the @xmath0 invariant matrix and possible perturbations of it directly correspond to the the mass matrix for the assumed majorana neutrinos but not for the charged leptons and quarks . in the latter cases ,",
    "the effects of the three higgs mesons being assumed must be folded in as in eqs.([3phime ] ) and ( [ quarkmasses ] ) .",
    "an additional difference is that the matrix for the majorana neutrino masses must be a symmetric one .",
    "if we assume that the perturbations are invariant under only an @xmath8 subgroup of @xmath0 , there are three choices .",
    "these correspond to two element subgroups containing , besides the identity element , @xmath190 , @xmath191 or @xmath192 .",
    "requiring , a general matrix , @xmath193 to commute with these separately gives , respectively the @xmath8 invariant forms : @xmath194 , \\hspace{.2 in } \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } a''&c''&b '' \\\\",
    "\\\\ b''&c''&a '' \\end{array } \\right ] ,    \\hspace{.2 in } \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } e'''&d'''&d ' '' \\\\ c'''&a'''&b ' '' \\\\ c'''&b'''&a ' '' \\end{array } \\right ] .",
    "\\label{s2matrices}\\ ] ] each of these possible perturbation matrices contains five complex parameters . in case of application to the majorana neutrino masses , there will be only four complex parameters since we have the corresponding symmetric structures : @xmath195 , \\hspace{.2 in } \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } a''&c''&b '' \\\\",
    "\\\\ b''&c''&a '' \\end{array } \\right ] ,    \\hspace{.2 in } \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } e'''&c'''&c ' '' \\\\ c'''&a'''&b ' '' \\\\ c'''&b'''&a ' '' \\end{array } \\right ] .",
    "\\label{s2majoranamatrices}\\ ] ] the simplest perturbation scheme would consist of the original form , eq.([s3type ] ) plus one of the three matrices in eq.([s2matrices ] ) [ or eq.([s2majoranamatrices ] ) for the majorana neutrino case ] .",
    "each of the three possible sums can be seen to have five [ four ] complex parameters , as one can absorb the two @xmath0 invariant matrix parameters in the parameters of the perturbing matrix .",
    "presumably , one of these three possibilities would be the best .",
    "the perturbation scheme which might be the closest analog of the generalized gell - mann okubo type mentioned in the introduction would contain the @xmath0 invariant part together with two of the matrices in eq.([s2matrices ] ) [ eq.([s2majoranamatrices ] ) ] .",
    "it can be seen that one would get the same number , eight [ six ] , of complex parameters regardless of which set of two is selected .",
    "in fact , regardless of which set is chosen , the resulting sum of three matrices would be the same . in the case of the majorana neutrino matrix",
    ", the six complex parameters already comprise the most general matrix . for the charged fermion matrices ,",
    "nine parameters are needed for the most general possibility ; however , all of the perturbation matrices satisfy the relation : @xmath196 thereby eliminating one complex parameter .",
    "clearly , there is no point in considering a perturbation made as the sum of all three matrices in eq.([s2matrices ] ) .",
    "the most practical second approximation would seem to involve choosing just one of the matrices of eq.([s2matrices ] ) [ eq.([s2majoranamatrices ] ) ] . a promising choice of perturbation , where the @xmath8 subgroup includes the element @xmath192 has been investigated by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "for a long time the permutation invariance , @xmath0 of the three known generations has been considered a very natural assumption for understanding the non - trivial spectrum of fundamental fermion masses and their associated mixings .",
    "recently , experimental data on neutrino oscillations have pointed to a leptonic mixing matrix which is of the so called tribimaximal form ; this is in essence the transformation from the natural three dimensional basis of @xmath0 to the irreducible basis and therefore can be regarded as another motivation for this group .",
    "we have attempted to spell out in detail a possible way in which this attractive @xmath0 permutation invariance can be consistently implemented in the standard electroweak theory .",
    "we started by reviewing the fact that exact @xmath0 invariance is not correct and suggesting that the situation might be analogous to an older one where a symmetry group was very plausible but the exact dynamics were unknown ",
    "the su(3 ) symmetry of the three quark model .",
    "a similar proposal is that the @xmath0 invariance holds for a dominant piece but that there are other ( presumably relatively small ) pieces which preserve different @xmath8 subgroups of @xmath0 . in this paper we concentrated on looking at the first approximation of exact @xmath0 invariance .",
    "we showed , by comparison with results of analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments ( see table i ) that there is a large range of allowed neutrino mass sets where near degeneracy of all three neutrino masses is a very good approximation .",
    "so we regarded a near degenerate neutrino mass spectrum together with a tribimaximal type neutrino mixing matrix as the @xmath0 invariant form to be obtained . at the same time we considered that the @xmath0 invariant structures for the charged leptons and quarks should contains masses for the ( @xmath197 ) states and zero masses for the others .",
    "the @xmath0 invariant mixing matrices for the charged fermions are all considered to be just the unit matrix ( no mixing to leading order ) .",
    "it is not completely trivial to obtain a model which achieves this desired spectrum . to get it",
    ", we included the features of i ) majorana type cp violation , ii ) @xmath0 invariance for only the left fermions , iii ) inclusion of three higgs doublets linked to the three generations and transforming under @xmath0 and iv ) spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 due to only one of those three doublets developing a vacuum value .",
    "the motivation is given in section iv in which it is shown that , very generally , one can not get a tribimaximal form for the overall lepton mixing matrix together with the given mass spectrum of the charged leptons in the simplest way one would imagine .",
    "a physical prediction of the model when the neutrinos are assumed to be of majorana type is obtained for the neutrinoless double beta decay factor @xmath198 already in the @xmath0 invariant limit ( see eq .",
    "( [ ourmee ] ) ) .",
    "this gives a bound which should be testable in the relatively near future if the three neutrinos belong to the energy range where they are approximately degenerate .",
    "one natural extension of this approach would be to look at its embedding in a grand unified theory .",
    "the next step would be to investigate in detail the case when a perturbation breaking the symmetry down to an @xmath8 subgroup is included .",
    "as discussed in section vii , this would introduce two additional complex parameters for the neutrino mass matrix .",
