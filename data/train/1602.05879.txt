    "a majority of nascent proteins must be folded into their native states shortly after emerging from the ribosome in order to avoid aggregation in the complex and crowded environment of the cell @xcite .",
    "this task is partially fulfilled thanks to a variety of molecular chaperones that assist folding , as well as help preventing and repairing misfolded proteins @xcite .",
    "another factor , that has been under intense research , is the effects of the ribosome on folding of nascent proteins @xcite .",
    "several studies have demonstrated that the ribosome facilitates correct folding of nascent proteins @xcite .",
    "the effects of the ribosome on nascent protein folding could be classified as due to two reasons : a ) the elongation of polypeptide chain during translation and b ) the confinement of ribosomal exit tunnel and its interactions with nascent proteins .",
    "the first one is associated with the hypothesis of cotranslational protein folding , namely folding that occurs during protein synthesis , which receives now a substantial experimental support @xcite .",
    "a basic feature of cotranslational protein folding is vectorial folding @xcite , which begins from the n - terminus and proceeds to the c - terminus of protein , as a result of vectorial synthesis .",
    "this folding mechanism is quite different from that of refolding @xcite of a free denatured protein in solution .",
    "the impact of vectorial folding on folding efficiency is expected to be much stronger in multi - domain proteins than in single domain proteins as it minimizes the chance of interdomain misfolding @xcite .",
    "another feature of cotranslational protein folding is that it is influenced by translation rates , both locally @xcite and globally @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that changing local translation rates by using alternative rna codons leads to a significant effect @xcite , and may coordinate cotranslational folding @xcite . on the other hand , protein structures may have evolved to exploit the effects of cotranslational folding .",
    "it has been found that the propensity to form an @xmath0-helix , obtained by analysis of pdb structures , is significantly higher near the c - terminus than near the n - terminus of proteins , in agreement with a non - equilibrium effect found in the folding of a growing chain @xcite .",
    "the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel @xcite is a narrow passage , through which nascent proteins are secreted into cellular environment .",
    "originated at the peptidyl transferase center ( ptc ) , where peptide bond formation takes place , the tunnel traverses through the body of ribosome large unit , and exits at the ribosome outer surface on the opposite side .",
    "it is constructed by aligned segments of the 23s rrna molecule and several ribosomal proteins @xcite .",
    "the length of ribosomal tunnel is @xmath1100 @xmath2 , whereas its diameter varies in a range of approximately 1020 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the tunnel is narrowest and also slightly bended at the constriction site of about 20 @xmath2 distal from the ptc .",
    "the narrow confinement of the tunnel would hinder the formation of tertiary structures @xcite , whereas simple structural units such as @xmath0-helices and @xmath3-hairpin have been reported to form inside the tunnel @xcite .",
    "experimental studies also have indicated that the ribosomal tunnel is a peptide - sensitive tunnel @xcite and may play an active role in modulation of translation and folding of nascent proteins @xcite .",
    "simulations of cotranslational protein folding revealed closer details of the folding process at the exit tunnel , and suggest that the impact of the tunnel on folding is rather not universal , but secondary structure dependent @xcite and protein dependent @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the effects of ribosomal exit tunnel on folding of nascent proteins with a focus on what going on after the translation is complete and the polypeptide chain is no longer bound to the ptc .",
    "in contrast to the growth of the polypeptide chain during translation , which is , to some extent , quite steady and predetermined , the subsequent process in which the full length protein escapes from the exit tunnel is stochastic with much less controls by the ribosome .",
    "we are interested in how the confined geometry of the exit tunnel and its interaction with nascent proteins influence their escape and folding processes .",
    "the aim is also to elucidate the interplay between these two processes and its dependence on temperature . with an attempt to map the dynamics of the escape process to one - dimensional diffusion model",
    ", we would like to make the problem general and predictable .",
    "we will confine ourself to an idealized model of the ribosomal tunnel , in the form of a hollow cylinder , with an assessment that the detailed shape of the tunnel also plays some role but is less substantial .",
    "the proteins are considered in a coarse - grained go - like model @xcite .",
    "these simplified models and molecular dynamics method combined with umbrella sampling @xcite allow us to obtain a comprehensive picture of the non - equilibrium characteristics of the folding and the escape processes , as well as equilibrium characteristics such as effective free energy along the tunnel axis .",
    "we will consider two small single - domain proteins of approximately the same size but different native state topology for comparison .",
    "the interaction of the tunnel with proteins will be modeled by putting attractive sites on the tunnel wall with a potential homologous for all amino acids , as a first order approximation .    the remaining of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides a detailed description of the coarse - grained models used for the proteins and for the exit tunnel .",
    "section 3 provides the results on folding and escape of nascent proteins at the exit tunnel along with a diffusion description for the escape process and the effects of attractive sites .",

    "the collapse of the data for different values of friction coefficient @xmath33 suggests that the simulations are done in the overdamped limit @xcite .",
    "the smaller exponent @xmath0 for temperatures below the folding temperature suggests that diffusion in this regime is facilitated by the folding of the protein . if the protein was unfolded , the escape time in these temperature range would be longer , as can be seen by extrapolation of the power law for the higher temperature regime to the lower temperature regime ( dashed line in fig .",

    "again , the diffusion of spa at low temperatures is also facilitated by the folding of this protein , but not as much as for gb1 .",
    "the larger exponents found for spa than for gb1 suggest that diffusion of helical proteins is slower than @xmath3-sheet containing proteins .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath3-sheets , particularly hairpins , are much more difficult to form inside the tunnel than @xmath0-helices .",
    "therefore , @xmath3-sheets are much more favorable when found outside the tunnel , leading to an increased escape rate in comparison to @xmath0-helices .",
    "the data on escape times reveal the dependence of diffusion constant @xmath91 on temperature and friction coefficient .",
    "because the diffusion speed should be proportional to the inverse of escape time , one obtains : @xmath124 since @xmath107 is approximately constant in the present case of a purely repulsive tunnel , the behavior of @xmath91 is expressed as in the r.h.s .",

    "this enhancement in the exponent of @xmath33 can be understood as due to additional friction between nascent protein and the tunnel wall .",

    "the positions of the attractive sites were chosen such that they roughly coincide with the position of the free energy minimum calculated for amino acids along the tunnel as shown in fig .",
    "@xcite . in our model",
    ", these attractive sites attract all amino acids , therefore will certainly slow down the escape of nascent protein from the tunnel .",
    "the question we ask is how the folding of protein at the exit tunnel and how the diffusion characteristics of the escape process are affected by attractive sites . for simplicity , we consider only the case of fast translation with @xmath44 for the proteins at the tunnel with attractive sites , with an assessment that the results of slow translation are qualitatively similar .",
    "our simulations show that the attractive sites can change the folding pathway of gb1 while they have no such effect on spa .",
    "[ fig : ghis6]a shows the histogram of conformations obtained in multiple folding trajectories at the tunnel with 6 attractive sites for gb1 at @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast to the two distinct pathways found for the case of a purely repulsive tunnel ( fig . [",
    "fig : ghis]b ) , one can see that in fig .",
    "[ fig : ghis6]a , there is only one pathway that exits from the tunnel .",
    "this pathway corresponds to conformations in which the c - terminal @xmath3-hairpin of gb1 is formed within the tunnel . for the tunnel with 4 attractive sites ( fig .",
    "s3 of supplemental material @xcite ) , the second pathway , in which the c - terminal @xmath3-hairpin is not formed in the tunnel , still exists but is populated by fewer trajectories than in the case of a purely repulsive tunnel .",
    "thus , the attractive sites promote formation of @xmath3-sheet inside the tunnel . in the case of spa",

    "our simulations showed that , for temperatures about or lower than @xmath63  the temperature of the fastest folding in presence of the tunnel , the escape time is significantly longer than the refolding time , thus , allows for concomitant folding and escape at the tunnel .",
    "the fact that vectorial folding induced by the tunnel happens at low temperatures is beneficial for nascent proteins because it would help the protein to avoid kinetic traps @xcite which are easy to be encountered at low temperatures .",
    "the escape time is expected to depend on the tunnel size and shape .",
    "in fact , our simulations indicate that the escape time increases with the tunnel diameter @xmath54 and length @xmath35 ( detailed analysis will be given elsewhere ) .",
    "it is an interesting question of whether the ribosomal tunnel s detailed size and shape have been selected by nature for a facilitated vectorial folding of nascent proteins at the tunnel by mediating their escape time .",
    "denatured proteins typically refold to their native states through multiple pathways in a rugged energy landscape @xcite . here",
    ", we show that folding at the tunnel proceeds along a single or at most a few pathways in a much reduced conformational space .",
    "this dramatical reduction in the number of conformations and the number of pathways is a key factor in helping nascent proteins to avoid kinetic traps .",
    "our free energy calculations also showed explicitly that the pathways at the tunnel are downhill without kinetic traps .",
    "remarkably , our simulations also showed that , at least for protein gb1 , the folding efficiency in presence of the tunnel is improved in comparison to that without the tunnel .",
    "this result is in agreement with recent experiments which indicated that the ribosome promotes correct folding of nascent proteins @xcite .",
    "our finding that the escape process can be mapped to an one - dimensional diffusion model in an effective linear potential could be verified experimentally and may be useful for studying the interactions between nascent protein and the exit tunnel .",
    "we have shown that , in the case of the tunnel without attractive sites , folding facilitates the escape process , as expressed by a lower exponent @xmath0 for the diffusion at temperatures lower than the folding temperature than for that at higher temperatures .",

    "thus , interactions of nascent proteins with the tunnel strongly affect the dynamics of their escape from the tunnel .",
    "an analysis of escape rates , that would be obtained by experiments , may reveal about these interactions .",
    "while the geometry of the ribosomal exit tunnel has been precisely determined @xcite , its detailed interactions with nascent proteins are still under ongoing research . in a recent study , pande and coworkers @xcite calculated free energy profiles for single amino acids in the exit tunnel and found that a large free energy barrier ( up to about 7 @xmath133 ) near the exit port is commonly observed for most of the amino acids , despite the differences in their side - chain chemico - physical properties .",

    "our result for the tunnel with attractive sites also yields a free energy barrier for the nascent proteins .",

    "the net effect of this barrier is an enhanced foldability of the released protein and minimizing the chance of aggregation .",
    "folding of nascent proteins at ribosomal exit tunnel has been studied in simple models .",
    "we have shown that the ribosomal exit tunnel has several strong effects on the dynamics of nascent proteins .",
    "first , it induces vectorial folding with improved folding efficiency by allowing the nascent chain to gradually escape from the tunnel .",
    "this vectorial folding is concomitant with the escape process and happens only at a low temperature range favorable for folding .",
    "second , folding at the tunnel follows a single or a few pathways allowing the protein to avoid kinetic traps .",
    "third , the escape process can be characterized as one - dimensional diffusion of a particle in an effective linear potential field which depends on the condition for folding , such as temperature , and the interaction of nascent protein with the exit tunnel .",
    "it was shown that folding speeds up the diffusion , whereas attractive interactions between the nascent protein and the tunnel wall slow it down .",
    "@xmath0-helical protein also tends to escape more slowly than @xmath3-sheet containing protein .",
    "we have also shown that a slow escape from the tunnel is better for vectorial folding , and consequently improves folding efficiency .",
