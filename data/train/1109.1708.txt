    "local experimental probes have highlighted the importance of intrinsic disorder and spatial inhomogeneity in the studies of high - tc superconductors .",
    "in particular , scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements have revealed nano - scale modulations in the gap for quasiparticle excitations and the local density of states ( ldos).@xcite complementary to these ( energy resolved ) density modulations , it is well - known that the spin density is also heterogeneous and exhibits spin - glass behavior in the underdoped regime .",
    "this seems to apply to both `` clean '' cuprates like yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) where quasi - static sdw order is found in the far - underdoped regime,@xcite and to intrinsically disordered materials like la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( lsco ) where the static spin correlations are long - range , and persist for a large doping range well into the superconducting dome.@xcite the size of the spin - glass phase in temperature and doping is clearly enhanced by disorder . at present a detailed understanding is lacking of the connection between the modulated spin density and the sts tunneling data.@xcite    in order to further probe the effects of disorder , samples with additional extrinsic impurities have also been studied .",
    "most notably , substitutional zn ions strongly suppress t@xmath7 and induce localized low - energy density of states resonances.@xcite in the spin sector , zn is known to slow - down and eventually freeze the spin fluctuations.@xcite for example , in near - optimally doped lsco increasing amounts of zn substitution has been shown to shift spectral weight into the spin gap , and eventually generate elastic magnetic peaks in the neutron response.@xcite a similar zn - induced spin - freezing has been obtained for ybco@xcite and is generally consistent with @xmath8sr data on underdoped cuprates.@xcite    theoretical modeling of these experimental results are complicated by the need to include both charges , spins , and realistic disorder configurations.@xcite within an unrestricted hartree - fock approximation of the hubbard model including @xmath9-wave pairing one may acquire a qualitative understanding of the disorder - induced magnetism ; due to the splitting of low - energy in - gap impurity states , it can be advantageous to generate local af order which may percolate , and eventually form a quasi - long - range ordered state.@xcite this scenario is a many - impurity generalization of the well - known one - impurity result of induced local magnetization,@xcite and agrees with transport measurements.@xcite recently , the dynamics of spin freezing by impurities , i.e. the shift of magnetic spectral weight to low energies , were calculated explicitly and shown to be consistent with this scenario as well.@xcite    the above approach , while successful to an extent , has obvious theoretical drawbacks .",
    "first , it can not describe the approach to the mott insulator ; underdoping has to be understood as the effective increase of correlations represented by @xmath10 as one underdopes due to the suppression of screening , but there is no way to calculate this effect systematically .",
    "secondly , the connection between correlations and pairing is entirely artificial , since the bcs pairing term is added by hand and treated in mean field .",
    "what is needed is a technique which allows for the study of local variations of observable quantities in the presence of disorder , which easily accounts at least for the crude effects of strong correlations in the underdoped regime .    here",
    ", we study disorder - induced magnetism within the gutzwiller approximation ( ga ) of the @xmath0 model . the ga has not been traditionally applied to include spin non - degeneracy , but was extended to include antiferromagnetism by ogata and himeda for the homogeneous case.@xcite the so - called extended gutzwiller factors ( egfs ) have been applied to inhomogeneous problems by interpreting them in a site - dependent manner .",
    "the site - dependent egfs have been used to study local magnetic moments around a nonmagnetic impurity,@xcite electronic states around a vortex core,@xcite and anti - phase superconducting domain structures.@xcite more recently , a simplified version of the egfs , with the advantage that they reduce to the well - defined extensively tested original site - dependent gutzwiller factors,@xcite have been used to examine the energetics of the charge and spin stripe ordered superconducting state.@xcite we focus on two distinct cases : 1 ) weak scatterers with impurity concentration equal to the doping level , @xmath11 , modeling the disorder potential from out - of - plane dopants , and 2 ) small concentrations , @xmath12 , of strong scatterers simulating the effects of substitutional disorder e.g. zn or vacancies . in both cases",
    ", we find that disorder may induce af phases in the underdoped regime .",
    "the origin of the induced magnetism is vastly different , however . in the former case of dopant disorder ,",
    "the redistributed charge density creates local regions close to half - filling in - between the impurities , pushing these areas across the bulk magnetic phase boundary .",
    "we denote this kind of magnetic phases by type i. by contrast , in the other case of substitutional disorder , even a single impurity nucleates magnetization in its vicinity , and the final spin structure consists of overlapping single - impurity regions which may orient themselves in order to minimize the exchange energy.@xcite this kind of disorder - induced magnetic phase is called type ii in this paper .",
    "the density of states in the disordered phase largely retains its @xmath9-wave v shape in agreement with experiments@xcite and consistent with earlier theoretical studies.@xcite surprisingly , however , the magnetic regions exhibit a larger superconducting gap and reduced associated coherence peaks in agreement with the general characteristics of the large - gap regions in the experimental sts data .",
    "finally we discuss additional sub - gap features in the ldos which could function as fingerprints for local magnetism in tunneling experiments .",

    "however , some unexpected subtleties were also discovered . in the case of dopant disorder where the impurity concentration equals the doping level and",
    "the individual disorder potentials are weak , local charge reorganization can induce regions with finite magnetization located away from the impurities . on the other hand ,",
    "strong scatterers locally pin af regions which may merge and eventually form a quasi - long - range ordered spatial structure .",
    "remarkably , the ldos at low energies remains largely disorder independent whereas the superconducting gap ( coherence peak height ) extracted from the ldos is increased ( decreased ) in the magnetic regions present in the underdoped regime .",
    "the goal of this analysis is to work towards a theory incorporating disorder , superconductivity and correlations capable of describing local spectroscopies of cuprates across the phase diagram .",
    "perhaps the most successful approach thus far , in terms of reproducing the many statistical observables reported by stm , has been the phenomenology of nunner _",
    "et al._@xcite to some extent this success was only possible , however , because a ) correlations were neglected and doping dependence ignored ; and b ) an impurity was assumed _ ad hoc _ to add independent coulomb and pairing potentials to the system .",
    "the present work has attempted primarily to address the deficiency represented by a ) .",
    "earlier works , notably ref . also incorporated disorder and correlation in the superconducting state , but neglected both the modulation of the pairing interaction by disorder and the possibility of local magnetism .",
    "the latter effect has been shown here to lead to some of the important correlations present in @xmath8sr , neutron scattering , and stm ; in particular the anti - correlation between peak height and gap amplitude has been exhibited in the locally ordered magnetic phases .",
    "on the other hand , the modulation of the pairing potential represented by the exchange constant @xmath91 in the model renormalized by the local gutzwiller factors is relatively weak , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] .    , where @xmath92 are the four nearest neighbors to site @xmath15 , obtained from @xmath93 shown for a configuration of weak impurities [ type i disorder ] with @xmath94 similar to fig .",
    "[ figx0125 ] ]    thus the positive correlations of the gap size with the o defect position , identified as crucial in mcelroy _ et al._,@xcite will not occur in the present model when the correlations become weak enough in the overdoped phase . from fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] one can see that the impurities cause local reductions of @xmath91 because the gutzwiller factor @xmath95 is a decreasing function of the doping level .",
    "the present approach , therefore , does not include the possibility , discussed in nunner _",
    "et al._,@xcite that the defect distorts the lattice locally leading to a different pairing interaction , as represented , e.g. by a local enhancement of @xmath91 .",
    "local impurity - enhancements of @xmath91 is also obtained by explicitly including the different impurity potentials on the two sites involved in the exchange process.@xcite the notion of local @xmath91-enhancement has been explored by maska",
    "_ et al._,@xcite foyevstova _",
    "et al._,@xcite johnston _",
    "et al._,@xcite and khaliullin _ et al._@xcite with model - dependent results ; all however indicate that sizeable modulations of the pairing interaction can indeed occur .",
    "these effects have been left out of the current approach , but will be included in our future studies of this problem .    for completeness , we mention a second possibility@xcite to explain the defect - gap correlations at optimal to overdoping , that a second source of disorder is present , correlated with the o dopants , and not imaged in the experiment of mcelroy _ et al._@xcite this scenario is plausible but requires the existence of a second , independent source of disorder . in addition , it has been found in density functional theory structural studies that both in the o dopant case and that of the structural supermodulation , cuo@xmath6 half - octahedra are tilted in identical ways by the perturbation,@xcite and are correlated empirically the same way with the gap modulations,@xcite lending credence to the idea that a single set of o dopants is the primary driver of the structural distortions and gap changes .",
    "we therefore believe that the combination of effect of electronic correlations as described here , together with a practical description of the modulation of the pairing gap , should provide a complete description of the statistics of local stm observables over the whole phase diagram .",
