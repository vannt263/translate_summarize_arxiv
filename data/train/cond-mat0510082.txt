    "our experiments study the orientational ordering of horizontal , quasi - two - dimensional assemblies of millimeter - sized , elongated particles driven into motion by external vibration in the vertical direction .",
    "since the particles we study are rod - like and do not deform appreciably , the natural point of comparison is the phase behaviour of thermal equilibrium hard - rod systems in two dimensions .",
    "the experiments address some basic questions on how systems in driven , nonequilibrium steady states differ in their phase behaviour and dynamics from similar systems at thermal equilibrium : can the nonequilibrium phase diagram be rationalized by a comparison to hard - rod monte carlo simulations @xcite alone or must we invoke new physics ? in thermal equilibrium , the ordering of hard - rod liquid crystals is determined solely by geometrical considerations of packing , which should apply equally in the molecular and macroscopic realms . on the other hand ,",
    "thermal fluctuations are of no importance in the systems we report in this article , and all exploration of phase space is made possible only by means of external driving forces .",
    "the nonthermal nature of the system has several implications : well - established extremal principles involving free energy and entropy can not be invoked , the sources of fluctuation and dissipation are distinct , and nonequilibrium fluctuations may either help or hinder certain kinds of order . `",
    "moving xy models ' of flocking @xcite , for instance , have been shown to display true long - range order in two dimensions , unlike their equilibrium counterparts . nonequilibrium steady states with strictly nematic order @xcite",
    "are predicted to have anomalously large density fluctuations , and velocity autocorrelations that decay much slower than in corresponding thermal systems .",
    "there are also a number of papers @xcite on the dynamics of orientable systems that are motivated by the biologically important motor - microtubule system .",
    "these systems support a variety of nonequilibrium structures , in particular , rotating vortices , which have no equilibrium analogue . while the particles in these systems are polar in nature and therefore not directly comparable to our particles , they do show the possibilities of qualitatively new phases and defect behaviours in systems of self - driven orientable particles @xcite . in the context of nonthermal systems like granular media ,",
    "edwards and coworkers have taken an entirely different theoretical approach : they propose a statistical mechanics for granular systems by constructing an ensemble that includes with equal probability all mechanically stable realizations of a system .",
    "the phase behaviour of a system of anisotropic grains has been considered @xcite within this framework .",
    "the theory predicts , remarkably , that elongated particles do not undergo an isotropic - to - nematic transition as a function of density .",
    "there have also been some recent experiments and simulations on the packing of anisotropic granular particles under gravity .",
    "monte carlo @xcite simulations of ellipses falling in 2-dimensions found that they tend to orient with their long axes perpendicular to gravity .",
    "quasi-2d experiments and simulations @xcite on cylinders showed similar results , with nematic ordering extending over two particle lengths .",
    "@xcite studied the compaction of rods in 3-dimensions : rods were poured into a cylindrical container and compacted by tapping i.e. applying isolated vertical jolts .",
    "while quantitative measures of orientational order were not presented , it was observed that repeated tapping caused the rods to orient vertically , first at the walls and then in bulk , into smectic - like layers .",
    "_ @xcite have studied vibrated systems of rods , contained in circular and annular geometries . at high packing fractions ,",
    "the rods separated into regions where they are stacked horizontally , and regions in which rods came out of the horizontal plane and are only slightly tipped from the vertical ; in the latter regions , vortices formed , rotating in a direction governed by the tilt of the rods .",
    "a phenomenological explanation for the formation and motions of the vortices was proposed in ref .",
    "although we do report on nonequilibrium dynamical effects such as these , our major preoccupation here is with static orientational ordering . also , the role of gravity in our experiments is to be distinguished from those reported in refs .",
    "@xcite : while gravity is very important in the kinematics of the particle motion it does not play the role of an ordering field as in @xcite .",
    "the ordering in our system arises purely from interparticle interactions .",
    "measurements of the isotropic - nematic transition in a quasi-2d system of vibrated rods have also been reported by @xcite .",
    "the focus in that paper is on understanding the long - wavelength distortions of the director in terms of competition between wall alignment and bulk elasticity.experiments very similar in intent to ours have been performed by fraden and coworkers @xcite .",
    "while there are no firmly - founded theoretical predictions to guide the effort of charting out a nonequilibrium phase diagram for elongated particles , simulations of hard rods in equilibrium provide a valuable point of reference . frenkel and others @xcite",
    "have performed monte carlo simulations in two dimensions , on spherocylinders of length @xmath0 and diameter @xmath1 .",
    "they find that nematic phases do not form for particle aspect ratio @xmath2 . instead",
    ", they identify an isotropic phase at low number densities and a layered solid at high densities . for particles with @xmath3",
    "a nematic phase intervenes at intermediate area fractions . in a grand canonical monte carlo study in two dimensions , khandkar and barma @xcite",
    "confirm the quasi - long - range nature of nematic ordering in the `` needle '' ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) limit , and demonstrate that imposed gradients in the chemical potential suppress director fluctuations .",
    "a recent monte carlo simulation @xcite studies the ordering of rectangles with @xmath5 and finds a transition from isotropic to tetratic order . in an earlier work ,",
    "@xcite report the occurrence of a cubatic phase in a system of truncated spheres and more recently borukhov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite find cubatics in linker - filament models for the cytoskeleton .",
    "while we are able to make a detailed comparison to these equilibrium simulations , due to the macroscopic nature of the particles we are also able to explore a new axis in the study of hard - rod systems : we can make essentially arbitrary variations in the shape of the particles by selectively etching cylindrical rods .",
    "we find a surprising dependence on the precise shape of the particle  objects with similar aspect ratios but dissimilar shapes order differently .",
    "it is not possible to determine on the basis of our work alone whether this shape - sensitivity is a nonequilibrium effect , however , we hope to stimulate more detailed investigations of these effects in hard - particle simulations .",
    "following this introductory section is an experimental section , [ exp ] in which we describe the particles used in our study , the geometry of the cell , and the driving mechanism .",
    "the system is visualized by real - space images ; the acquisition and analysis of the images is also outlined .",
    "a detailed description of our results is in section [ results ] , but we summarize these briefly here : strictly cylindrical particles show substantial tetratic ( that is , four - fold orientational ) correlations at both small ( @xmath6 ) and large ( @xmath7 ) aspect ratio .",
    "the length scale of the correlations increases as the number density is increased ; however , we do not see long - range order ( lro ) over the range of area fractions and vibration amplitudes we explore .",
    "particles that are thinner at their tips ( `` rolling pins '' or `` bails '' , see figure [ particle_types ] ) show nematic ordering at high area fractions in the same range of aspect ratios . for shorter particles ( @xmath8 )",
    "we obtain a defect - ridden nematic state with large- scale swirling motion at the number densities we study in our experiment . for @xmath9",
    ", we find at high densities , a phase with at least quasi - long - range nematic order ( qlro ) , that is , power - law decay of nematic correlations .",
    "we can induce transitions out of this nematic phase either by lowering number density or by increasing the intensity of the driving .",
    "finally , long - grain , basmati rice , with an aspect ratio of @xmath10 , shows phases with strong indications of smectic order .",
    "we comment on this below in section [ smectics ] .",
    "we also find intriguing dynamical phenomena , with clear signatures of nonequilibrium behaviour , as discussed at the end of section [ results ] .",
    "our experiments involve vertically shaking a horizontal layer of rod - like particles .",
    "the rods were confined to a single layer between an aluminium substrate and a lid that fit over the particles leaving them only a little vertical room to move in . in this section",
    "we describe the particles , the geometry of the experimental cell , the driving mechanism and , finally , the methods of image acquisition and analysis .      .[particlefactfile]tabulated below are the details of the various particles we used in our experiments . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     given the small system sizes in our experiment , we expect strong finite size effects . in order to assess more",
    "precisely whether the correlations were long - ranged , power - law , or short - ranged with very long correlation lengths , we performed a subsystem analysis of the cumulants following @xcite .",
    "the quantities evaluated were @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the order parameter ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 runs over the number @xmath15 of particles within the subsystem defined by @xmath0 ) and @xmath0 is the linear size of the subsystem over which @xmath16 was evaluated , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the binder reduced cumulant , @xmath19 was then evaluated .",
    "the results are plotted as a function of area fraction , @xmath20 , for different subsystem sizes @xmath0 in figure [ ulvsaf ] .",
    "as shown in @xcite , for phases with lro the curves for different system sizes @xmath0 will cross at a certain value of area fraction @xmath21 . if there is qlro , the curves of @xmath22 vs @xmath20 for different @xmath0 should collapse onto a single line over an extended range of values of @xmath20",
    ". the lower limit of this value will be @xmath23 , the isotropic - nematic transition value .",
    "figure [ ulvsaf ] suggests that the phases formed at the higher area fractions do show qlro and the isotropic- nematic transition occurs at an area fraction somewhere between 50% and 60% . in fig.[nematic_ulvsss ] we show the binder cumulant as a function of subsystem sizes @xmath0 , for different area fractions , @xmath20 .",
    "the downturn at large @xmath0 for @xmath24 indicates short - range order .",
    "we show a greatly magnified version of this plot for the two higher area fractions as an inset .",
    "@xmath22 for 70% is slightly but systematically larger than that for 60% .",
    "this difference is at the edge of our resolution , but it leaves open the tempting possibility that these nonequilibrium nematics have true , rather than quasi- long - range order .",
    "further measurements on large systems are required to settle this important question of principle .",
    "the presence of a third dimension into which the particle is lofted means that the 2-dimensional projections of the particles can overlap and that unlike hard particles , a temperature variable could be relevant to the order . as we said in subsection [ cell ] , the shaking amplitude @xmath25 could act as a kind of temperature .",
    "a natural dimensionless measure of how strongly the system is being shaken is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the oscillation frequency and the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "we studied the effect on the nematic order of changing acceleration while holding fixed the gap height , @xmath29 and particle diameter , @xmath1 ; changing these would have changed the inter - penetrability of the particles in two dimensions .",
    "figure [ diff_amplitudes ] shows the binder reduced cumulant of the phase as a function of dimensionless acceleration .",
    "the area fraction of the phase is about 63% , within the nematic regime identified in fig.[nematic_ulvsss ] .",
    "the acceleration is varied by holding the frequency , @xmath27 , fixed and varying the amplitude , @xmath25 . even though @xmath30 over the entire range of amplitudes , the higher shaking amplitudes do affect the extent of order in the system .",
    "this is not entirely surprising : while @xmath25 is small , the ratio of the characteristic kinetic energy @xmath31 and the maximum possible potential energy @xmath32 varies from @xmath33 to @xmath34 over the range of the plot .",
    "however , as can be seen by the small range of vertical axis , the degree to which the phase disorders by increasing @xmath35 from 5 to 8 is much less than that achieved by reducing the area fraction from 70% to 50% .",
    "our observations on basmati rice gave images with strong indications of striped , i.e. , smectic order ( see fig .",
    "[ realspace ] ) . in two - dimensional systems at thermal equilibrium ,",
    "we know that thermal fluctuations render smectic order strictly short - ranged , while in three - dimensional systems it is quasi - long - ranged .",
    "these conclusions are based on derivations of the variance of layer displacement fluctuations from an elastic free - energy functional , in which , as a consequence of rotation - invariance , the cost of layer displacements with wavevector @xmath36 parallel to the layers varies as @xmath37 .",
    "since the systems we are studying are driven , not thermal equilibrium , these arguments do not apply _ a priori _ , and the possibility of quasi - long - range ( or , for that matter , true long - range ) smectic order in our vibrated granular- rod monolayers remains open .",
    "we are studying this possibility theoretically @xcite .",
    "experimentally , however , our systems are not large enough for the type of analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) required to check whether the images we are seeing are true smectics , weakly ordered two - dimensional crystals , or smectics disordered by the presence a finite but small density of free dislocations ( which would be nematics on large length scales ) .",
    "all the phases showed a marked tendency to rotate globally .",
    "for the nematic phases , the square frame prevented them from rotating ( except in certain cases , which we shall come to in the next paragraph ) , but we could not prevent the tetratic phase from rotating , in part because we did not use a square frame , since we wanted to see how strong the tetratic correlations were in the absence of such externally imposed four - fold alignment .",
    "since this is a nonequilibrium system , any stray chirality in the system , even at the boundary , should result @xcite in macroscopic circulation .",
    "the observed global rotation is thus a signature of the driven nature of the system . a thermal equilibrium system ,",
    "no matter how chirally asymmetric , would not display persistent currents .",
    "our observed rotation rates were of the order of a degree in @xmath38 cycles of oscillation .",
    "in one instance , when we were using the bails in the square boundary ( where , under normal circumstances , the rotations are curbed ) , the phase began rotating fast , turning through a degree in @xmath39 cycles of oscillation .",
    "the source of the asymmetry appeared to be a slight misalignment of the particles fixed at the boundary , because we were able to stop the rotation by aligning them more carefully .",
    "that this minor imperfection in boundary alignment could have such a strong effect was a surprise , and means the rotation phenomenon merits more serious investigation .",
    "since _ basmati _ rice ( aspect ratio @xmath40 ) showed smectic tendencies , we studied tapered copper rods with similar aspect ratio ( aspect ratio @xmath6 ) but half the length of the rice grains , in the hope of getting a larger number of smectic layers in the sample cell .",
    "unexpectedly , we found no sign of smectic layering . instead , a very dynamic pattern of swirls appeared , reminiscent of bacterial swimming patterns @xcite .",
    "the swirly state looks like a defect- ridden nematic , which is curious because equilibrium monte carlo studies on rods in two dimensions suggest that nematics should not form for aspect ratios less than 7 .",
    "these swirls , which are strength @xmath41 disclinations , differ from those seen in @xcite : the latter are strength 1 , they have a core that looks like a crystalline packing of standing rods , and each defect is chiral because the rods have a systematic tilt in the direction of their tangential velocity orientation of the rods in the region outside the core . in our case , the circulation appears to be a result of the interaction between defects .",
    "it remains to be seen whether we are seeing coarsening towards a nematic , the disordering of a nematic ( i.e. , coarsening towards the isotropic phase ) , or simply a disordered , correlated , defect - turbulent steady state .",
    "this paper has presented an exploration of the collective properties of vibrated rods in two dimensions , focusing on orientationally ordered phases .",
    "tapered particles lead to nematic order at large area fractions , in keeping with the thermal equilibrium monte carlo studies of @xcite , while strictly cylindrical particles , with flat tips , display strong tetratic correlations over a very broad range of aspect ratios .",
    "it remains to be established whether the strong sensitivity to particle shape is a nonequilibrium phenomenon or whether it can be reproduced in equilibrium simulations .",
    "we also observed some clearly nonequilibrium phenomena : persistent , systematic rotation of the entire phase , presumably as a result of stray chirality in the system , and also a rich pattern of circulating disclinations of strength @xmath42 1/2 .",
    "detailed quantitative analyses of the dynamics of the swirls , of tagged - particle motion and time - dependent correlations of collective modes and other nonequilibrium effects will appear in a separate paper @xcite .",
