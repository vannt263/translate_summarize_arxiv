    "it is a remarkable feature of fullerene buckyballs that they can exist as delocalized quantum waves @xcite , as is proven almost routinely in matter wave interference experiments @xcite .",
    "such interferometer setups involve nanomechanical grating structures , typically made of gold or silicon nitride . as the molecules pass through the grating slits they experience an attractive dispersion force between the polarisable molecule and the grating wall . even though this casimir  polder ( cp ) interaction is weak , it must be accounted for in predictions of the interference fringes @xcite .",
    "the influence of dispersion forces is particularly strong in modern near - field interference setups where many different interference orders contribute resonantly , implying that even tiny distortions of the molecular wave fronts affect the fringe pattern @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "it is the presence of the casimir ",
    "polder interaction which impedes the demonstration of interference with even larger and more polarisable particles @xcite . at the same time",
    ", this strong sensitivity of the fullerene matter waves provides a means of verifying the precise value and functional form of the dispersion forces .",
    "it is therefore important to have a reliable description of the expected casimir  polder potential available , which should also account for molecules not in thermal equilibrium with their environment , given that the beam is usually produced by thermal sublimation .",
    "casimir  polder interactions have been studied intensively in recent years , though mainly focused on atoms @xcite .",
    "such studies include thermal equilibrium @xcite as well as non - equilibrium situations @xcite in which the internal temperature of the microscopic ( atomic or molecular ) system can be vastly different from that of the macroscopic environment .",
    "carbon - based nanostructures have been of particular interest due to applications . in this context , the interaction of a carbon nanotube with a surface has been studied @xcite .    motivated by the mentioned matter - wave interference experiments we now discuss and evaluate in detail the cp interaction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 fullerenes with planar surfaces made of gold or silicon nitride ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) . in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we summarise the basic equations that govern the cp potential , determine the molecular polarisabilities of the fullerenes from spectroscopic data , and list the material parameters of the surface materials . in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we calculate the cp potentials by both numerical and analytical means and discuss our results . a short summary is given in sect .",
    "we begin by presenting the theory of the thermal cp potential and by recording the molecular and material properties as obtained from optical data .",
    "we consider a non - magnetic , isotropic molecule of internal temperature @xmath4 placed at a distance @xmath5 from a plane non - magnetic surface of permittivity @xmath6 , with both surface and environment being held at uniform temperature @xmath7 . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the thermal cp potential of the molecule can be given as a sum of non - resonant and resonant contributions , @xmath8    the non - resonant contribution is due to virtual photons and it is given by a sum @xmath9\\\\ \\times\\int_{\\xi_j / c}^\\infty{\\mathrm{d}}\\kappa^\\perp\\ ,   { \\mathrm{e}}^{-2\\kappa^\\perp z }   \\bigl[\\xi_j^2r_s(\\xi_j,\\kappa^\\perp)\\\\   -\\bigl(2\\,\\kappa^{\\perp 2}c^2-\\xi_j^2\\bigr )   r_p(\\xi_j,\\kappa^\\perp)\\bigr]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] over the purely imaginary matsubara frequencies @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where the prime indicates that the @xmath12 term carries half - weight .",

    "the reflection coefficients for real frequencies can be given as @xmath27 with @xmath28 if @xmath29 , @xmath30 if @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "we stress that the molecule is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment whenever @xmath34 . here , the thermal polarisability as well as the internal - state populations of the molecule depend on its internal temperature @xmath4 , while the matsubara frequencies and thermal photon numbers are given in terms of the environment temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the dielectric permittivity @xmath6 of thin fullerene films in the optical regime has been measured by means of electron energy - loss spectroscopy @xcite as well as in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "the frequencies and dipole matrix elements of the corresponding electronic transitions of single fullerene molecules can be deduced from the data in ref .",
    "@xcite in a two - step procedure .",
    "we first apply a simultaneous least - squares fit of an @xmath35-oscillator model @xmath36 to the measured data for the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity as taken from ref .",
    "the fits with @xmath37 oscillators for @xmath0 and @xmath38 for @xmath1 are illustrated in figs .",

    "[ tab1 ] fit parameters obtained for the permittivity of @xmath0 films in the optical regime . @xmath44 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that the line widths have practically no influence on the nonretarded potential , with differences of about @xmath45 .",
    "this tiny change is quadratic in the line widths and unobservable in an experiment .    in an alternative approach based on linear - response theory @xcite ,",
    "the atomic properties enter via the fluctuation  dissipation theorem .",
    "the resulting cp potential depends on the atomic polarisability in its unsymmetrised form , @xmath46 the atomic transition frequencies and line widths are not considered explicitly , but only appear at the end of the calculation when specifying the polarisability . in particular , the line widths now affect the potential already to linear order . as seen from table  [ tab9 ] , this leads to a prediction of a reduction of the @xmath47 coefficient by about @xmath48 due to absorption .",
    "this effect could be visible in sufficiently accurate @xmath47 experiments , making it possible to distinguish between the macroscopic , linear response model for absorption and our microscopic model ( which predicts that the effect of absorption on ground - state potentials is negligible ) .",
    "this possibility makes fullerenes most attractive for cp - potential studies .",
    "in contrast , atomic systems are unable to resolve the difference between the effects of symmetrised vs unsymmetrised polarisabilities ( or the neglect of line widths altogether ) .",
    "finally , let us discuss the impact of the infrared resonances on the @xmath0 potential .",
    "as seen from table  [ tab6 ] , their dipole moments are much smaller than those of the optical transitions ( table  [ tab3 ] )",
    ". on the other hand , their transition wavelengths being much longer than those of the optical transitions , the nonretarded limit applies over a larger range of distances .",
    "in addition , the thermal photon numbers can take large values even at room temperature , so that resonant potentials  ( [ eq7 ] ) come into play .    at distances up to about @xmath49",
    ", the cp potential due to phonon resonances is strongly nonretarded . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the potential in this regime is well approximated by @xmath50 with @xmath51 where the sum only runs over phonon transitions .",
    "this result holds regardless of the environment temperature for all materials of sufficiently large permittivity .",
    "the corresponding @xmath47 coefficient depends on the internal temperature of the molecule , it ranges from @xmath52 at zero temperature to @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "a comparison with the @xmath47 coefficients listed in table  [ tab8 ] reveals that the potential contribution from infrared phonon transitions is smaller than the discussed potential from optical transitions by more than two orders of magnitude .    at larger distances , corrections due to",
    "imperfect reflectivity manifest themselves @xcite .",
    "however , they do not affect the order of magnitude of the phonon cp potential , which remains insignificant .",
    "as we have numerically verified , the phonon contributions only become relevant at very large distances , well beyond @xmath55 .",
    "we have determined the casimir  polder interaction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with plane surfaces of au and two different nitride species , as commonly used in molecular interference experiments .",
    "the numerically calculated potentials is well approximated by the thermal , retarded and nonretarded asymptotes for large , intermediate and small distances , respectively .",
    "we have found that the potential is entirely due to optical transitions and hence independent of the internal temperature of the molecules .",
    "the environment temperature affects the potential for distances larger than @xmath56 at room temperature . comparing the potentials for different silicon nitride species",
    ", we have found differences of up to @xmath57 in the nonretarded regime , which is most relevant for diffraction experiments .    according to our microscopic theory of the molecule ",
    "field interaction , the finite line widths of the molecules have practically no influence on the casimir  polder potential .",
    "a macroscopic linear - response approach , on the other hand , predicts that they decrease the nonretarded potential by about @xmath48 .",
    "the relatively large line widths of the fullerene transitions thus make them an ideal system to study the impact of molecular absorption on dispersion interactions .",
    "we thank h.  ulbricht and s.  nimmrichter for discussions .",
    "support from the european science foundation ( esf ) within the activity ` new trends and applications of the casimir effect ' is gratefully acknowledged .",
