    "we propose a new framework of shift dynamics , called functional shifts , which extends symbolic dynamics . a functional shift",
    "is defined as a shift space that is a set of bi - infinite sequences of some functions on a set of symbols , while symbolic dynamics is usually defined as a set of bi - infinite sequences of finite symbols .",
    "this functional shift generates another shift space , called a generated shift , as follows .",
    "consider a sequence of functions @xmath0 contained in the functional shift .",
    "the sequence of functions generates a sequence of symbols @xmath1 determined by @xmath2 .",
    "a set of such bi - infinite sequences of symbols is also a shift space .",
    "thus , this framework gives us a method to analyze the relationship among classes of shift spaces using the generative operation .",
    "introducing the framework of functional shifts allows us to consider the dynamic change of functions . in traditional dynamical systems theory ,",
    "the time dependence of a function governing change of states is not serious .",
    "the reason for is that time in a dynamical system can be treated as an additional phase space variable , so that for any dynamical system we can describe it with a time independent function .",
    "however , the time dependency of functions , i.e. , the dynamic change of functions , has recently become a subject of interest in the investigation of dynamical systems , because there are many phenomena in which functions should be regarded as variable .",
    "for example , in a population dynamics with species extinction and speciation , the degree of freedom dynamically changes @xcite . in studying such phenomenon , since it is difficult to get an immutable evolution rule , we want to treat functions of the system as dynamic .",
    "therefore , considering dynamic changes of function is an important perspective for understanding complex systems .",
    "we often call such dynamic changes meta - dynamics .",
    "several models have been proposed to study the dynamic change of functions @xcite .",
    "sato and ikegami @xcite introduced switching map systems , in which maps to govern the evolution of the systems are dynamically switched with other maps in the system . kataoka and kaneko @xcite investigated the evolution of a one - dimensional function @xmath3 defined by @xmath4 . studying dynamics in",
    "which functions vary in time using meta - dynamics can be important when considering systems evolution or learning .",
    "fontana @xcite studied abstract chemical systems that are defined by a loop in which objects encode the functions that act on them . for another instance , tsuda @xcite proposed a switching map system as a model of the brain . he has shown that a skew - product transformation can be considered as a framework describing meta - dynamics .",
    "functional shifts also can be represented by skew - product transformations .",
    "the framework of functional shift has two major advantages .",
    "one is the ability to directly compare dynamics with meta - dynamics , since both are represented by shift spaces .",
    "the other is to be able to analyze both dynamical and computational characteristics , because this framework is an extension of symbolic dynamics .",
    "moreover , as a kind of meta - dynamics , we can discuss self - modifying systems in terms of functional shifts , in which the functions governing the dynamics of the system are used to change the functions themselves .    in this paper",
    ", we study functional shifts from the viewpoints of both dynamics and computation . in recent years",
    ", several studies have focused on the relationship between dynamics and computation @xcite .",
    "the central idea in these studies is to regard the time evolution of dynamics as a computational process .",
    "based on a correspondence between the unpredictability of dynamical systems and the halting problem , moore @xcite insists on the existence of dynamics that are more complex than chaos .",
    "in addition , computational complexity for continuous time analog computation has been studied @xcite , in which the convergence of ordinary differential equations is interpreted as a process of computation .",
    "the relationship between the complexity of dynamics and computation is , however , still unclear . in this work",
    "we discuss the complexity of the dynamics of functional shifts in terms of topological entropy , which measures the diversity of orbits of dynamical systems , and also investigate the complexity of their computation in terms of the chomsky hierarchy . through this study",
    ", we argue that dynamics and computation give us opposite results concerning the complexity of systems .    in an analysis of the complexity of computation in functional shifts",
    ", we prove that there exists a shift space whose language is not recursively enumerable ( r.e . ) , even though the language of the functional shift that generates it is r.e .",
    "computational classes of sets to be beyond r.e .",
    "are related to analog computation in the interest of both dynamics and computation . while siegelmann @xcite introduced analog shifts as a model of analog computation which is more powerful than the universal turing machine , the dynamical features of such a powerful computation system are an open problem .",
    "when we study dynamical systems modified by meta - dynamics , we discuss analog computation with functional shifts , and argue that the existence of dynamical behaviour that is more complex than the universal turing machine should be taken into account .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review some basic definitions of shift spaces , and define functional shifts in section [ section : definition ] .",
    "next , in section [ section : entropy ] , we investigate the property of entropy in functional shifts . we show that the entropy of a functional shift gives the upper limit for that of a generated shift given by it , in order to study the relationship between dynamics and meta - dynamics ( see theorem [ theorem : upper_limit_for_entropy_of_functional_shifts ] ) . in section [ section :",
    "computation ] , we compare functional shifts with generated shifts , by focusing on how the language of a shift space belongs to the chomsky hierarchy of formal languages . we prove that any class of the languages of functional shifts is contained in that of the generated shifts given by them ( see corollary [ corollary : class_of_fss_subset_that_of_gss ] and theorem [ theorem : shift_of_finite_type_and_sofic ] , [ theorem : cfg_to_cfg ] , and [ theorem : language_of_generated_shift_beyond_r.e . ] ) .",
    "one of the most important results in this section is that there is a shift space whose language is not r.e .",
    ", even though the language of a functional shift to generate the shift space is r.e.(see theorem [ theorem : language_of_generated_shift_beyond_r.e .",
    "finally , our results are discussed from the standpoints of dynamics , computation , meta - dynamics , and self - modifying systems .",
    "since we will study shift dynamics , we first give some definitions for shift spaces @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be a nonempty finite set of symbols called an alphabet .",
    "the full @xmath5-shift ( simply the full shift ) is the collection of all bi - infinite sequences of symbols from @xmath5 . here",
    "such a sequence is denoted by @xmath6 and the full @xmath5-shift is denoted by @xmath7 a block over @xmath5 is a finite sequence of symbols from @xmath5 .",
    "an @xmath8-block is simply a block of length @xmath8 .",
    "we write blocks without separating their symbols by commas or other punctuation , so that a typical block over @xmath9 looks like @xmath10 . a sequence of no symbols is called an empty block and denoted by @xmath11 . for any alphabet @xmath5 , we write @xmath12 to denote the set of all blocks over @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath13 and @xmath14 , then we denote a block of coordinates in @xmath15 from position @xmath16 to position @xmath17 by @xmath18 } = x_i x_{i+1 } \\cdots x_{j}$ ] .",
    "let @xmath19 be a shift map on a full shift @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 for any @xmath22 .",
    "a subset @xmath23 of @xmath20 is called shift - invariant iff @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 , which we call the forbidden blocks , be a collection of blocks over @xmath5 .",
    "for any such @xmath25 , define @xmath26 to be the subset of sequences in @xmath20 in which no block in @xmath25 occurs .",
    "a shift space is a subset @xmath23 of @xmath20 such that @xmath27 for some collection @xmath25 .",
    "note that if @xmath23 is a shift space then @xmath23 is shift - invariant , but a shift - invariant set is not necessarily a shift space ( some examples are in ref@xcite ) .",
    "the set of all @xmath8-blocks that occur in points in @xmath23 is denoted by @xmath28 , and the language of @xmath23 is the collection @xmath29 .",
    "the language of a shift space determines the shift space .",
    "thus two shift spaces are equal iff they have the same language .",
    "suppose that @xmath23 is a shift space and @xmath5 is an alphabet .",
    "an ( @xmath30)-block map @xmath31 maps from allowed ( @xmath30)-blocks in @xmath23 to symbols in @xmath5 .",
    "a map @xmath32 defined by @xmath33 with @xmath34 is called a sliding block code induced by @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath36 is a shift space over @xmath5 and @xmath37 , then we write @xmath38 .",
    "if a sliding block code @xmath38 is onto , @xmath39 is called a factor code .",
    "a shift space @xmath36 is a factor of @xmath23 if there is a factor code from @xmath23 onto @xmath36 .",
    "a sliding block code @xmath38 is a conjugacy from @xmath23 to @xmath36 if it is bijective .",
    "two shift spaces @xmath23 and @xmath36 are conjugate ( written @xmath40 ) if there is a conjugacy between @xmath23 and @xmath36 .                _ proof .",
    "_ let @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "suppose that @xmath23 is a shift space which can be described by the collection @xmath25 of forbidden blocks .",
    "if @xmath48 , then @xmath49 because every block in @xmath25 does not occur in @xmath15 .",
    "thus @xmath50 .",
    "conversely if @xmath49 , then @xmath51 } \\not\\in \\mathtt{f}$ ] for all @xmath8 because @xmath25 is a set of blocks never occurring in points in @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , @xmath52i+1 } = f_i(x_{[-n , n]i}),\\ ] ] then @xmath53 so that @xmath48 .",
    "accordingly @xmath54 .",
    "hence @xmath55 and @xmath44 is a shift space .    by theorem [ theorem : generated_shifts_are_shift_spaces ] , a functional shift is regarded as a rule to generate a shift space . since any functional shift is also a shift space , we can compare functional shifts with generated shifts by using the properties of shift spaces ."
