    "the observation of the @xmath0 pentaquark , an exotic bound state with the quark content @xmath8 , is one of the most puzzling mysteries of recent years ( see  @xcite for an experimental overview ) .",
    "the @xmath0 was first observed in exclusive reactions at low energy  @xcite .",
    "later several groups reported observation in inclusive reactions at higher energies  @xcite .",
    "conversely , other experiments at high energies do not see the @xmath0 pentaquark although they do observe significantly larger yields of conventional hyperons than seen at the experiments that observe the @xmath0 . in order to resolve this discrepancy",
    "it is frequently assumed that pentaquark production decreases rapidly with energy .",
    "a high statistics experiment at low energies is therefore important . in order to achieve this",
    ", belle utilises the small fraction of tracks that interact with the material of the inner part of the detector .",
    "these secondary interactions are used to search for pentaquarks .",
    "particles produced in @xmath9 annihilation at belle have quite low momenta ; the most probable kaon momentum is only @xmath10 .",
    "results from two analyses are presented . in the first , we search for inclusive production of the @xmath0 via the @xmath11 , @xmath12 process , using the signal from inclusive @xmath1 production as a reference . in the second , we search for exclusive @xmath0 production in the charge exchange reaction @xmath13 . for this search ,",
    "the yield of charge exchange reactions is used as a reference , allowing a direct comparison to the results of the diana experiment  @xcite .",
    "these studies are performed using a @xmath14 data sample collected at the @xmath6 resonance and @xmath15 at an energy @xmath16 below the resonance .",
    "the data were collected with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric energy @xmath7 storage rings  @xcite .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer cylindrical drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like array of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an array of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a superconducting solenoidal coil that produces a 1.5 t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect muons and @xmath17 mesons ( klm ) .",
    "two different inner detector configurations were used .",
    "for the first sample of @xmath18 , a @xmath19 cm radius beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector ( svd1 ) were used ; for the second sample of @xmath20 , a @xmath21 cm radius beampipe , and a four - layer silicon vertex detector ( svd2 ) , and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used  @xcite .",
    "a geant  @xcite based monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation is used to model the production of secondary @xmath22 pairs , and to determine the detector resolution and acceptance .",
    "the analyses are performed by identifying @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 produced at secondary vertices .",
    "charged particle candidates are required to be positively identified based on the cdc ( @xmath26 ) , tof and acc information .",
    "in addition , proton and charged kaon candidates are removed if they are consistent with being electrons based on ecl , cdc and acc information .",
    "@xmath27 candidates are reconstructed from @xmath28 pairs that have masses within @xmath29 of the nominal @xmath27 mass ( 3@xmath30 window ) .",
    "additional selection requirements are imposed on the quality of the @xmath27 vertex , on the impact parameters of the daughter tracks and on the angle between the momentum and the direction from the interaction point ( ip ) to the vertex .",

    "the @xmath1 yield , defined as the fit function signal component integrated over the @xmath47@xmath48 mass interval ( @xmath49 ) , is @xmath50 events .",

    "the @xmath0 is assumed to be narrow and its shape is determined by the detector resolution function , which is again a double gaussian with similar parameters to those used for the @xmath23 mode .",
    "the mc resolution is checked against data using the @xmath51 signal , which has a topology similar to the secondary @xmath25 pairs .",
    "it is found that the @xmath52 width is 4% percent larger in data than in mc , and this correction factor is applied to the mass resolution of secondary @xmath25 vertices . for @xmath53 the fit yield is @xmath54 events . using the feldman - cousins method of upper limit evaluation  @xcite , we find @xmath55  events at the 90%  c.l .",
    "the upper limit is below 320 events for a wide range of possible @xmath0 masses .",
    "we set an upper limit on the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 production cross sections : @xmath56 it is assumed that @xmath57 .",
    "we take @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of efficiencies for @xmath59 and @xmath60 of about 41% is obtained from mc simulation assuming that the two processes have similar kinematics .",
    "our limit is much lower than the results reported by many experiments that observe the @xmath0 .",
    "for example it is two orders of magnitude lower than the value reported by the collaboration  @xcite .    the momentum spectrum of the produced @xmath1 is shown in fig .  [ incl ]  ( b ) .",
    "this spectrum is obtained by fitting @xmath41 in momentum bins and correcting for the efficiency obtained from the mc .",
    "if a @xmath1 is produced as an intermediate resonance in the elastic scattering of a @xmath61 on a free proton , then its momentum is around @xmath62 . as such",
    ", the observed hard momentum spectrum of the @xmath1 confirms that they are produced in inelastic interactions .",
    "we find that non - strange particles do not produce @xmath1 since the secondary @xmath23 pairs are accompanied by an additional @xmath63 from the same vertex in only about 0.5% of events .",
    "the projectiles that can produce @xmath1 are @xmath61 , @xmath27 , @xmath17 and @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath65 needs a momentum of about @xmath66 to produce the @xmath1 .",
    "the number of such @xmath65 s in @xmath9 annihilations is small .",
    "the observed number of @xmath1 can not be produced by @xmath65 projectiles even if the total @xmath67 cross section is assumed to be saturated by inclusive @xmath1 production .",
    "we therefore conclude that our @xmath1 signal is due to kaon interactions , with a contribution of @xmath64 interactions no larger than a few percent .",
    "possible exclusive pentaquark production is studied using the @xmath68 reaction , searching for the @xmath0 as an intermediate resonance .",
    "since the projectile is not reconstructed , it is not possible to distinguish this reaction from the reactions @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and inelastic reactions with a @xmath71 or undetected tracks in the final state .",
    "therefore we apply selection criteria which suppress the contribution of the inelastic reactions in the sample of secondary @xmath25 pairs ( see section  [ pks_ul ] ) , and determine the contribution of the charge exchange reaction indirectly , as described below in this section .",
    "the cross section of the @xmath72 reaction is expected to be similar to the cross section of the @xmath13 reaction  @xcite , however the flux of @xmath27 is decreased by decays in flight and we conservatively neglect the contribution of this reaction .",
    "the @xmath70 reaction can produce a dip in the @xmath0 region because of the interference of resonant and nonresonant amplitudes .",
    "however , the size of the dip is expected to be negligible  @xcite .",
    "the number of charge exchange reactions can be estimated in a straightforward way using the known flux of primary @xmath63 , @xmath73 , the reaction cross section , @xmath74 , the amount of material , @xmath75 , and the reconstruction efficiency for the secondary @xmath25 pair , @xmath76 , and taking into account nuclear effects : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the product of @xmath79 branching fractions @xmath80 , @xmath81 is a nuclear spectral function which is a joint probability to find in a nucleus a nucleon with energy @xmath82 and fermi momentum @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the centre of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of the reaction squared , @xmath85 is the energy and @xmath86 is the momentum of the projectile , @xmath87 is the mass of the produced pair , @xmath88 is the probability that the produced pair is not rescattered in the nucleus and @xmath89 and @xmath33 are the radial distance and polar angle of the secondary vertex , respectively .",
    "however , it is difficult to accurately estimate the systematic errors in this calculation because @xmath75 and @xmath76 are complicated functions of the coordinates and the estimation of @xmath90 and @xmath88 is model dependent .",
    "this problem is solved by reconstructing the decay chain @xmath91 , @xmath92 for events where a @xmath63 interacts elastically in the detector material .",
    "the reconstruction procedure is explained in detail in section  [ ndst_proj ] .",
    "the yield of such decays , @xmath93 , is expressed as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the flux of @xmath63 originating from the selected @xmath96 decay , @xmath97 is the cross section for elastic @xmath98 scattering and @xmath99 is the efficiency of reconstructing the secondary @xmath24 vertex .",
    "the nuclear suppression @xmath88 is assumed to be the same for @xmath24 pairs and @xmath100 pairs produced in the charge exchange reaction .",
    "we express @xmath101 in terms of @xmath93 .",
    "the expressions are simplified by the facts that the products @xmath102 and @xmath103 are approximately independent of @xmath33 for the central part of the detector ; the ratio @xmath104 is approximately independent of the secondary pair momentum , @xmath105 ; and the nuclear suppression @xmath88 is approximately independent of @xmath105 ( see section  [ ndst_proj ] ) .",
    "we approximate the nuclear spectral function as @xmath106 , where the function @xmath107 is defined so that @xmath108 corresponds to the maximum of @xmath81 .",
    "we obtain @xmath109 where @xmath110 the p.d.f . of the fermi momentum distribution @xmath111",
    "is determined from data in section  [ ndst_proj ] .",
    "the form of the @xmath107 is discussed in the same section .",
    "the integrations are described in section  [ phi_prim ] .",
    "equation   provides the basic formula to determine the yield of the charge exchange reaction in our data sample",
    ". the formula   would be even simpler if we could use @xmath63 projectiles from @xmath96 decays that undergo charge exchange in the detector material .",
    "however , the fraction of such events is very low because of the relatively small cross section , and the low @xmath27 reconstruction efficiency and branching fraction .      to determine the number of @xmath91",
    ", @xmath92 decays for which a @xmath63 interacts elastically in the detector material , the four - momentum of the interacting @xmath63 is reconstructed based on the information available from the produced secondary @xmath24 pair .",
    "if a secondary @xmath22 pair is produced in a quasi - elastic reaction , four - momentum conservation implies @xmath112 the nucleon energy , @xmath82 is approximated by  @xcite @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the nucleon mass and @xmath115 is the nucleon binding energy .",
    "this approximation is valid for the high @xmath116 part of the nuclear spectral function .",
    "another possible approximation is @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the average removal energy of the bound nucleon .",
    "we find that both approximations give a similar resolution in the @xmath119 mass ( see below ) and our result is independent of the choice .",
    "the quantities @xmath120 and @xmath121 are measured ; taking into account the primary and secondary vertex constraints , eqs   can then be solved iteratively .",
