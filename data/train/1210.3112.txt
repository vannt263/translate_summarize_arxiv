    "quantum walks , as the quantum version of the classical random walks , were first introduced in 1993 @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum walks have attracted great attention from mathematicians , computer scientists , physicists , and engineers .",
    "( for an introduction , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . some new quantum algorithms based on quantum walks",
    "have already been proposed @xcite .",
    "they proved that a discrete time quantum walk can be used to perform an oracle search on a database of @xmath8 items with @xmath9 calls to the oracle @xcite , and also can be used for universal computation @xcite .",
    "quantum walks in many different situations have been studied extensively .",
    "for example , the quantum walks in graph @xcite , on a line with a moving boundary @xcite , with multiple coins @xcite or decoherent coins @xcite .",
    "however , quantum walks in periodic potential has not been studied yet .",
    "this kind of quantum walks are popular in physics .",
    "for example ,",
    "the motion of the atom in the double well lattice @xcite and the propagation of photon in periodically varying the coupling in waveguide lattice @xcite with different waveguide periods or in the beam splitters array @xcite with two kinds of bs at periodic vertices . in this paper , we will present the behaviors of quantum walks in periodic potential .",
    "we will discuss the probability distribution and the standard deviation for different periods , potentials and steps .",
    "in this paper , we concern with the discrete - time quantum walks . to be consistent , we adopt analogous definitions and notations as those outlined in @xcite .",
    "the total hilbert space is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is spanned by the orthonormal vectors @xmath12 which representing the position of the walker and @xmath13 is the two - dimensional coin space spaned by two orthonormal vectors which are denoted as @xmath14 and @xmath15    each step of the quantum walk can be split into two operations : the flip of a coin and the position motion of the walker according to the coin state .    here , for simplicity ,",
    "we choose a hadamard coin as the normal quantum walk s coin , so the coin operator can be written as    @xmath16    the position displacement operator is given by    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the momentum operator , @xmath19 is the pauli-@xmath20 operator ,    @xmath21    therefore , the state of the walker after @xmath8 steps is given by    @xmath22^{n}\\mid\\psi_{0}\\rangle\\\\   & = \\left[\\sum_{x}\\hat{s}_{x}(\\hat{i}_{p}\\otimes\\hat{h}_{c})\\right]^{n}\\mid\\psi_{0}\\rangle , \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : hadamarddqw}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the initial state of the system .",
    "the rule of quantum scattering walks we use here was described in ref .",
    "suppose that the state is in @xmath24 which means that in the last step the walker walked from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "in the next step if it is transmitted , it will be in the state @xmath27 , and if it is reflected it will be in the state @xmath28 .",
    "then we have the transition rule    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the transmission and reflection coefficients respectively , the unitarity implies that @xmath32 .    if we use @xmath33 to represent the direction that the walker just walked , eq .",
    "can be written as : @xmath34    the unitarity of the scattering gives the transformation matrixes    @xmath35    from eq .",
    ", we can know that the quantum scattering walk is the same as the coined quantum walk @xcite . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and use the form of @xmath38 .",
    "then the scattering matrix can be written as    @xmath39    the case of @xmath40 corresponds to the discrete quantum walks with eq . .    .",
    "we will consider the case that a normal quantum walker walks in periodic potential like in fig .",
    "[ fig : period ] .    as a model",
    ", we consider the situation that the walker walks as scattering quantum walk at the positions with potential , and walks as normal discrete quantum walk for the rest .",
    "the potential is described by parameter @xmath2 .",
    "then , the operator can be written as    @xmath41    where @xmath1 is the period , @xmath42 is an integer , and the final state after @xmath8 steps is given by    @xmath43    here the initial state we use is    @xmath44     steps with the initial state @xmath45 and a hadamard coin , as well as for quantum walk but in periodic potential ( b ) with the period @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the same initial state.,width=288 ]    fig .",
