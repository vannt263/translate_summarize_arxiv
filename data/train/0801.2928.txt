    ", gauge potentials will appear which are traditionally only encountered in high energy physics to describe the interactions between elementary particles .",
    "ultracold atomic clouds are particularly promising candidates for realising such scenarios , since the access to physical parameters is , from an experimental point of view , unprecedented . extending the ideas of wilczek and zee , it was recently proposed that properly tailored laser beams coupled to degenerated internal electronic states can be employed to induce non - abelian gauge fields in cold - atom experiments @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a non - abelian gauge potential can be constructed in an optical lattice using laser assisted state sensitive tunneling @xcite . with the implementation of these proposals ,",
    "ultracold atoms would offer a unique testbed for the analysis of non - trivial non - abelian effects on the quantum dynamics of multicomponent wavepackets .    in this paper",

    "this setup opens up a number of new scenarios for ultracold gases , allowing for the study of _ non - abelian atom optics _ , which naturally ties together optical and magnetic effects .",

    "in fact this term reflects the non - abelian character of the gauge potentials .    to construct a scheme of laser - atom interactions that leads to a @xmath19 gauge potential we need",
    "degenerate ( or nearly degenerate ) dressed states .",
    "such a condition is fulfilled e.g.   for the tripod system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "a truly non - abelian situation emerges if the matrices @xmath20 do not commute . for this",
    "it is necessary that the off - diagonal element @xmath21 is non - zero .",
    "the hamiltonian of the tripod system reads in interaction representation as @xcite @xmath22 parameterizing the rabi - frequencies @xmath23 with angle and phase variables according to @xmath24 where @xmath25 , the adiabatic dark states read @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the gauge potential depends on the gradient of the dark states : @xmath28 and @xmath29 this provides a remarkable versatility .",
    "recent advances in shaping both the phase and the intensity of light beams makes it possible to choose practically any shape of the gauge potential provided the corresponding light field obeys maxwell s equations .",
    "this is certainly the case in a two - dimensional geometry , but also in three dimensions light beams can be tailored @xcite . in the abelian case a nonzero effective magnetic field is obtained if there is a relative angular momentum between the two light beams and the intensity ratio is spatially dependent @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the generation of a non - abelian gauge field does not require any elaborate shaping of the three laser beams employed .",
    "this is indeed the case if we choose the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "three plane - wave laser beams are used .",
    "two lasers of equal intensity are counter - propagating in the @xmath30-direction with wave vector @xmath31 while the third one ( of double intensity ) propagates in the y - direction also with a wave vector @xmath31 . with this arrangement , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 in the expressions above .",
    "the resulting vector potential is of the form : @xmath34 whereas @xmath35 by choosing the laser detuning such that @xmath36 we obtain a scalar potential proportional to the unit matrix , @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the scalar potential can be safely neglected as far as the wavepacket dynamics is concerned .",
    "in ref .  @xcite it was proposed that non - abelian gauge fields created in lattices can be employed to construct non - abelian atom interferometers . however , the read - out of any non - abelian atom interferometer may be crucially handicapped by the non - trivial interplay between external and internal degrees of freedom in the wavepacket dynamics of atoms in non - abelian gauge fields ( see sec .  [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "however , this coupling between external and internal dynamics may be prevented by considering atoms trapped in mobile optical tweezers .",
    "if the tweezer potential is strong enough , the system may be investigated in the so - called single - mode approximation , in which both components share exactly the same center - of - mass wavepacket . as a consequence",
    ", the non - abelian gauge field will just affect the internal dynamics of the atoms . in the following we envisage an experiment in which a cloud of ultra cold atoms is trapped by an optical tweezer under the conditions discussed above .",
    "when moving in the xy plane the atoms experience the gauge potential given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - matrix ] ) .",
    "we consider the case where the atoms are moved in the x and y direction ( fig .",

    "the initial state of the atom is assumed to be a linear superposition of both dark states : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mixing angle , and @xmath46 is a relative phase .",
    "the dynamics of the two level system obviously depends on the initial state , but more importantly , the final populations of the two dark states depend on which path is taken . after performing the clock - wise path",

    "it becomes clear that the outcome of choosing the @xmath38 or @xmath42 path can be very different .",
    "we stress that this effect is not directly linked to the appearance of off - diagonal terms in the corresponding matrices of the vector potential , but rather it is inherently due to the non - abelian character of the matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this effect is remarkably similar to the scattering of protons onto a non - abelian flux line , where a conversion of the proton into a neutron is anticipated @xcite .",

    "note in contrast to the previously considered laser - driven population transfer for tripod atoms @xcite here the non - abelian dynamics is due to the time - dependence of the phases of light fields `` seen '' by moving atoms rather than due to the time - dependence of the intensities of laser pulses .         as a function of the path length @xmath58 , whereas in fig .",

    "the non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect is a striking example where the internal dynamics of a two - level system is highly nontrivial .",

    "we now have to fully take into account the coupled internal and external degrees of freedom .    in the following",
    "we discuss the evolution of a cold atomic wavepacket in the presence of a non - abelian gauge field @xmath65 .",
    "we consider that the atomic gas is sufficiently dilute , and hence in this paper we neglect the effects of the interatomic interactions .",

    "as a consequence , the eigenvectors @xmath80 of @xmath81 are independent of @xmath73 , and the total wavefunction is at any time a linear combination of the form @xmath82 , where @xmath83 with @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the wavepacket evolution can be considered as an independent scalar evolution for the wavepackets in each component . in particular",
    ", it may be easily shown that the center of mass position of the wavepacket @xmath86 grows linearly in time with a velocity @xmath87 .",
    "hence the two wavepackets tend to separate during the time evolution .",
    "the picture changes completely if @xmath77\\neq 0 $ ] . in this case",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath81 do depend on the momentum @xmath73 considered , and hence the time - evolution of the wavepacket depends in a non - trivial way on the momentum distribution of the original wavepacket .",
    "we analyze in particular the center of mass ( cm ) motion of the wavepacket .",
    "the @xmath30-coordinate of the cm after a given time @xmath88 is better calculated in the momentum representation : @xmath89 , where we have employed the heisenberg picture .",
    "one can then easily obtain that : @xmath90 \\right\\rangle_0\\ ] ] where @xmath91 .",

    "note , that contrary to the abelian case , we have two inherently non - abelian effects . on one hand ,",
    "the evolution of the center of mass motion is in general a non - trivial non - linear function of time .",
    "however , for @xmath105 a linear behavior @xmath106 is recovered , i.e.  there is a characteristical transient stage where an inherently non - abelian - induced non - linear cm evolution occurs ( see fig .  [ fig:5 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "contrary to the abelian ( or scalar ) evolution , the evolution of the cm motion depends on the initial width @xmath107 of the momentum distribution .",
    "this effect can be traced back to the dependence of the eigenstates @xmath108 on @xmath73 .     in units of @xmath109 , as a function of @xmath110 , for @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , @xmath60 , @xmath113 .",

    "note that the details of the momentum distribution play a very important role in the wavepacket evolution in non - abelian gauge fields . obviously , if @xmath124 the non - abelian effects become negligible .",
    "but even if @xmath125 , an abelian evolution is recovered if @xmath126 , i.e.  the non - abelian effects are clearer for wavepackets which at @xmath117 are localized in space with uncertainties @xmath127 . the latter effect may be explained , because if @xmath128 then @xmath129 may be ( to a good approximation ) simultaneously diagonalized for all relevant values of @xmath73 in the distribution , and hence again two separated wavepackets as those for the abelian evolution are recovered .",
    "in addition , it is important to realize that the particular evolution also depends on the initial spinor configuration of the wavepacket ( although this dependence is not inherently non - abelian since it also occurs in the abelian evolution ) .",
    "[ fig:6 ] shows the results of our numerical simulations of the wavepacket evolution for the gauge field discussed above .",
    "note that contrary to the usual abelian ( or scalar ) evolution , there is a stark difference in the evolution of the shape of the wavepacket for different values of the momentum spreading @xmath130 .",
    "the non - abelian character of the gauge field leads also to interesting effects in the reflection of atomic wavepackets .",
    "ultra cold atomic wavepackets can be reflected at laser or magnetic mirrors @xcite . for typical situations",
    "the reflection of the center of mass of the wavepacket can be considered as specular , i.e.  the angle of reflection of the wavepacket with the normal vector of the mirror is exactly minus the angle of incidence of the original wavepacket .",

    "the effect of the mirror can not be mimicked by this image picture ( since contrary to the scalar case , a sinusoidal solution is not an eigenstate of @xmath129 ) . as a consequence",
    "the intuitive specular - reflection picture must be revised in the case of wavepackets in non - abelian gauge fields , even for the cases discussed below , in which both internal components experience exactly the same mirror potential .     where a steep potential is envisaged ( gray area ) .",
