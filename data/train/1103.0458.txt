    "the three - body problem , although being the simplest of the general @xmath2-body problem , does not have an analytical solution in the general case , which makes it possible to gain an understanding of its dynamics mostly through the means of numerical studies .",
    "those studies started even before any computers were developed and trace back to the beginning of the 20th century  @xcite . with the development of computers the effectiveness of these studies increased , but , due to the insufficient amount of data , this does not led to an immediate breakthrough in the understanding of the disruption process .",
    "valtonen  @xcite assumed that the tail of the disruption distribution should be exponential , though this assumption conflicts with the earlier theoretical result by that the average life - time of an isolated triple system should be infinite .",
    "later mikkola and tanikawa  @xcite found an exponential tail in the disruption statistics of the equal mass three - body problem .",
    "apart from this , shevchenko  @xcite has recently demonstrated that in the hierarchical three - body problem the decay of the survival probability is heavy - tailed with a power index equal to 2/3 , which corresponds to the first kind of hamiltonian intermittency ; the power - law tails in the equal mass three - body problem with indices close to that value were recently reported by orlov et al .",
    "@xcite ( they also appear in the decay of the survival probability of the exited atoms  @xcite ) .",
    "the second kind of the hamiltonian intermittency predicts the existence of a power - law tails with index equal to 3/2 ; a power index close to this value was reported by shevchenko and scholl  @xcite in the 3/1 jovian resonance ( sun  jupiter  asteroid problem ) .",
    "other than that , it appears that power - law tails are common for the disruption statistics of the hamiltonian systems of different nature ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as it was mentioned , both kinds of hamiltonian intermittency were seen in the three - body problem , hence , they both are `` native '' to this problem , yet , no one reported seing both of them in one set .",
    "that is why we decided to thoroughly investigate the equal mass three - body problem and demonstrate that both of them are present . in the next section",
    "we describe our numerical method and the initial data set , then we report the results and discuss them in the final section .",
    "to perform our calculations we use the version of the aarseth - zare _ triple _",
    "code  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with our previous paper  @xcite we used a `` standard '' way to define the initial conditions for the initially - resting triple system , used in , where the authors demonstrated that the approach used cover all possible configurations of three bodies .",
    "it is demonstrated in fig.[fig1 ]  that two bodies are placed in points a and b , while the third body could be placed in any point in the gray region .",
    "the gray region is bounded by the unit circle centered in a from the right , @xmath3 from the left and @xmath4-axis from the bottom .",
    "scanning over all possible initial positions of the third body gives us a complete set of data ( as we use the equal - mass        problem , that is enough ; should we use different masses , we have to permute the masses between a , b , and the `` running '' position , and use all the resulting time maps together ) .",
    "initially , all three masses are at rest , but immediately after they start moving in the gravitational potential they govern .",
    "the calculation of their motion lasts until the system disrupts ( at time @xmath5 ) or @xmath6 is reached ; the value for the maximal @xmath7 is adopted from  @xcite , where we saw that by this time @xmath1 is clearly reached in the equal - mass case , our current research proved that as well .",
    "the disruption of the system is determined by the hyperbolicity ( positivity of mechanical energy of the disrupting binary ) at a distance 50 times larger than the current semi - major axis of the final binary .",
    "this way of defining is by default used in the _ triple _ code that we are using and it is quite wide - spread in studying the three - body problem in astronomy .",
    "we have modelled over 30 million initial positions for the third mass that are evenly - distributed over the gray area in fig.[fig1 ] . the resulting @xmath8 integral distribution ( the number of trajectories with the disruption time that is greater than @xmath5 )",
    "was fitted by the power - law relation @xmath9 with steps @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; the result is presented in the upper panel of fig.[fa ] : @xmath10 as the red ( dark gray if grayscaled ) and @xmath12 as the thick black line .",
    "the strong noise of the first curve is caused by an insufficient number of data points in each bin ( @xmath10 ) , one can easily see that the second curve is much smoother and still , it has variations .",
    "they both approach @xmath13 , which is pretty close to @xmath14 that is expected from the first type of the hamiltonian intermittency . on the other hand , the minimum at low @xmath5 points to @xmath15 (",
    "although , it does not reach it , ending at @xmath16 ) that is expected from the second type of the hamiltonian intermittency , hence we investigate it further on .",
    "one note needs to be taken  with @xmath17 minimum at low @xmath5 could be easily missed and we believe that large @xmath18 was a reason why @xmath15 was not detected in this problem earlier .",
    "then we fit the @xmath8 curve as a sum of both contributions @xmath19 and this fit gives us an excellent result : , , , and .",
    "one can see that the powers are almost exactly equal to the predicted values ; in the bottom panel of fig.[fa ] we presented the @xmath8 curve ( thick gray ) , @xmath0 contribution ( dotted green ) , @xmath1 ( red dashed ) , and the sum of two contributions ( thin blue ) .",
    "one can see that the resulting curve fits @xmath8 quite well , while @xmath1 alone coincide with @xmath8 only starting from thousands of @xmath5 .",
    "we have considered the three - body problem with unit masses that are initially at rest and demonstrated that both terms  @xmath1 and @xmath0  contribute into the statistics of the disruption .",
    "the reason why @xmath0 contribution remained undetected in the equal - mass problem is because the corresponding trajectories are stuck to the strong chaos region at low @xmath5 .",
    "the chaotic pattern ends at the low values of @xmath5 , so the trajectories that are stuck to its border manifest themselves strongest at low @xmath5 as well ( though , not solely , since it is owing to the influence of @xmath0 contribution that the power of @xmath1 is not found exactly ) . fitting the @xmath8 curve clearly demonstrated the presence of both the contributions ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) , and the powers were confirmed with great precision .",
    "we believe that the reason why the power indices found in the earlier papers on this subject ( e.g.,@xcite ) were somehow lower than the expected @xmath20 was the interference from the @xmath0 term .",
    "also , high values for the maximal integration time usually lead to high values of @xmath18  the size of bin to plot the distribution .",
    "if @xmath21 , then the whole deep in upper panel of fig.[fa ] would be inside one bin , and so it could be undetected  we believe that this was , at least , partially , a reason why both indices simultaneously remained undetected .",
    "the author is grateful to alexey toporensky and ivan shevchenko for fruitful discussions and to sergey karpov and margarita khabibullina for the computational help .",
