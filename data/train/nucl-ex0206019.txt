    "the formation and binary decay of light nuclear systems in the a@xmath6 @xmath7 60 mass region produced by low - energy ( e@xmath8 @xmath7 7 mev / nucleon ) heavy - ion reactions has been extensively studied both from the experimental and the theoretical points of view @xcite . in most of the reactions studied the binary breakup of the compound nucleus ( cn ) is seen as either a fusion - fission ( ff ) @xcite or a deep - inelastic ( di ) orbiting @xcite process .",
    "the large - angle orbiting yields are found to be particularly strong in the @xmath1si + @xmath2c reaction @xcite , as illustrated by fig .  1 which summarizes some of the experimental results that have been collected for this system ; i.e. , orbiting cross sections  @xcite and total evaporation residue ( er ) cross sections  @xcite .",
    "since many of the conjectured features for orbiting yields are similar to those expected for the ff mechanism , it is difficult to fully discount ff as a possible explanation for the large energy - damped @xmath1si + @xmath2c yields  @xcite . however , ff calculations  @xcite significantly underpredict the cross sections measured in the carbon channel by almost a factor of 3 , thus suggesting an alternative mechanism ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "ff , di orbiting , and even molecular - resonance behavior may all be active  @xcite in the large - angle yields of the @xmath1si + @xmath2c reaction  @xcite .",
    "the back - angle elastic scattering of @xmath1si ions from @xmath2c displays structured excitation functions and oscillatory angular distributions in agreement with the relatively weak absorption of this system @xcite .",
    "moreover , the resonant gross structure  @xcite is fragmented into very striking intermediate width resonant structure  @xcite .",
    "superdeformed ( sd ) rotational bands have been found in various mass regions ( a = 60 , 80 , 130 , 150 and 190 ) and , very recently , sd bands have also been discovered in the n = z nuclei @xmath9ar  @xcite and @xmath0ca  @xcite .",
    "these new results make the a@xmath6 @xmath10 40 mass region of particular interest since quasimolecular resonances have also been observed in both the @xmath9ar and @xmath0ca dinuclear systems  @xcite .",
    "although there is no experimental evidence to link the sd bands with the higher lying rotational bands formed by known quasimolecular resonances , both phenomena are believed to originate from highly deformed configurations of these systems .",
    "since the detection of light charged particles ( lcp ) is relatively simple , the analysis of their spectral shapes is another good tool for exploring nuclear deformation and other properties of hot rotating nuclei at high angular momenta .",
    "experimental evidence for angular - momentum - dependent spectral shapes has already been extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite and , in particular , the @xmath11 mg + @xmath12o reaction  @xcite , which reaches the @xmath0ca cn , has been studied in detail .",
    "strong deformation effects have also been deduced from angular correlation data for the fusion reaction @xmath1si(@xmath2c,2@xmath4)@xmath13s@xmath14 at e@xmath8 = 70 mev  @xcite .",
    "we decided to investigate the @xmath0ca nucleus produced through the @xmath1si + @xmath2c reaction at beam energies of e@xmath8 = 112 mev and 180 mev .",
    "as can be observed in fig .  1 , model calculations suggest that at the lowest incident energy of the present work the orbiting process is dominant for the c and o channels whereas at e@xmath8 = 180 mev a large part of the o and n fully - damped yields may also result from a ff mechanism . in this article",
    "we will focus on the lcp s found in coincidence with heavy fragments .",
    "the present paper is organized in the following way .",
    "ii describes the experimental procedures and the data analysis .",
    "iii presents the inclusive and the exclusive @xmath1si + @xmath2c data ( part of the experimental results presented here in detail have already been briefly reported elsewhere  @xcite ) .",
    "the data are analyzed using the hauser - feshbach evaporation code cacarizo  @xcite using a consistent set of parameters which has been found to successfully reproduce @xmath11 mg + @xmath12o reaction results  @xcite .",
    "the full statistical - model calculations , using monte carlo techniques to account for the experimental acceptance when comparing to the experimental exclusive data , are presented in sec .",
    "the strong cluster emission of @xmath15be which is observed by the experiment is also discussed in this section .",
    "we end with a summary of our conclusion in sec .  v.",
    "the experiments were performed at the vivitron tandem facility of the ires strasbourg laboratory using 112 mev and 180 mev @xmath1si beams which were incident on @xmath2c targets ( 160 and 180 @xmath16g/@xmath17 thick , respectively ) mounted in the icare scattering chamber  @xcite .",
    "the effective thicknesses of the @xmath2c targets were accurately determined using rutherford back scattering ( rbs ) techniques with @xmath18h and @xmath19he beams provided by the strasbourg 4 mv van de graaff accelerator  @xcite .",
    "the carbon buildup corrections were found to be less than 2@xmath20 of the total of c atoms in the targets . both the heavy fragments ( a @xmath3 10 ) and their associated lcp s ( protons and @xmath4 particles ) were detected in coincidence using the icare charged - particle multidetector array",
    "@xcite which consists of nearly 40 telescopes .",
    "inclusive data have also been collected for heavy fragments and lcp s .",
    "the setup of the measurement at e@xmath8(@xmath1si ) = 112 mev was designed to collect only in - plane coincidences , whereas the setup at e@xmath8(@xmath1si ) = 180 mev allowed both in - plane and out - of - plane angular correlations to be measured ( see table i ) .",
    "the heavy fragments consisting of er as well as quasi - elastic , deep - inelastic , and fusion - fission fragments were detected in 8 gas - silicon hybrid telescopes ( ic ) , each composed of a 4.8 cm thick ionization chamber , with a thin mylar entrance window , followed by a 500 @xmath16 m thick si(sb ) detector .",
    "the ic s were located at forward angles in two distinct reaction planes ( for each plane , the positive and negative angles in table i are defined in a consistent manner as for the lcp detectors described below ) .",
    "the in - plane detection of coincident lcp s was done using 4 three - element telescopes ( tl3 ) ( 40 @xmath16 m si , 300 @xmath16 m si , and 2 cm csi(tl ) ) placed at forward angles , 16 two - element telescopes ( tl2 ) ( 40 @xmath16 m si , 2 cm csi(tl ) ) placed at forward and backward angles and , finally , two other ic telescopes located at the most backward angles ( see table i ) .",
    "the csi(tl ) scintillators were coupled to photodiode readouts .",
    "the ic s were filled with isobutane at a pressure of 30 torr for the backward angle telescopes and of 60 torr for the forward angle detectors , thus allowing for the simultaneous measurement of both light and heavy fragments .    for the measurement at e@xmath8(@xmath1si ) = 180 mev",
    ", two distinct reaction planes were defined as shown in table i. one for in - plane correlations and a second one , perpendicular to the lcp detection plane , for out - of - plane correlation measurements .",
    "the heavy fragments were detected in 10 ic s located at forward angles for both the in - plane coincidences and out - of - plane coincidences .",
    "both the in - plane and out - of - plane coincident lcp s were detected using 3 tl3 s placed at forward angles and 24 tl2 s placed at forward and backward angles .",
    "the ic s were filled with isobutane at a pressure of 60 torr .",
    "the acceptance of each telescope was defined by thick aluminum collimators .",
    "the distances of these telescopes from the target ranged from 10.0 to 30.0 cm , and the solid angles varied from 1.0 msr at the most forward angles to 5.0 msr at the backward angles , according to the expected counting rates .",
    "the energy calibrations of the different telescopes of the icare multidetector array were done using radioactive @xmath21th and @xmath22am @xmath4-particle sources in the 5 - 9 mev energy range , a precision pulser , and elastic scatterings of 112 mev and 180 mev @xmath1si from @xmath23au , @xmath1si , and @xmath2c targets in a standard manner .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2c(@xmath12o,@xmath4)@xmath11mg@xmath24 reaction at e@xmath8 = 53 mev @xcite was used to provide known energies of @xmath4 particles feeding the @xmath11 mg excited states , thus allowing for calibration of the backward angle detectors .",
    "the proton calibration was achieved using scattered protons from c@xmath25h@xmath26o@xmath27 formwar ( polyvinyl formal ) targets bombarded in reverse kinematics reactions with both @xmath1si and @xmath12o beams . on an event - by - event basis , corrections were applied for energy loss of heavy fragments ( a @xmath3 10 ) in the targets and in the entrance window mylar foils of the ic s and thin al - mylar foils of the si diodes . a correction was also applied for the pulse height defect in the si detectors .",
    "the ic energy thresholds and energy resolution for heavy fragments are better than 1.5 mev / nucleon and 0.7@xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the total energy resolution of 8.78 mev @xmath4 particles from thorium sources has been found to be better than 2.2@xmath28 for both the three - element and two - element light - ion csi(tl ) telescopes .",
    "absolute cross sections of inclusive measurements could be obtained within 10 - 12@xmath28 uncertainties , with 3 - 5@xmath28 uncertainties in the target thickness and to 8 - 10@xmath28 uncertainties in the electronic deadtime corrections .",
    "more details on the experimental setup of icare and on the analysis procedures can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the fragments with z = 15 - 17 have inclusive energy spectra that are typical of er s .",
    "the inclusive data of the binary fragments with z = 5 - 14 were obtained by integrating their 1/sin@xmath29 angular distributions .",
    "in particular the results of the cross sections with z = 6 - 8 are compared with the previously measured excitation functions  @xcite in fig .  1 .",
    "the agreement between both sets of data is satisfactory within the error bars .",
    "the lcp inclusive data can shed some light on the reaction mechanism .",
    "typical inclusive energy spectra of @xmath4 particles are shown for the @xmath1si + @xmath2c reaction at e@xmath8 = 112 mev in figs .",
    "2-(a ) and 2-(b ) and at e@xmath8 = 180 mev in figs .",
    "2-(c ) and 2-(d ) at the indicated angles . the solid points ( with error bars visible when greater than the size of the points ) are the experimental data whereas the solid and dashed lines are statistical model calculations discussed in sec .",
    "the @xmath4-particle energy spectra have a maxwellian shape with an exponential fall - off at high energy which reflects a relatively high effective temperature ( t@xmath30 @xmath10 [ 8e@xmath31/a@xmath32@xmath33 = 3.67 mev for e@xmath8 = 180 mev ) of the decaying nucleus . the spectral shape and high - energy slopes are also found to be essentially independent of angle in the c.m . system .",
    "these observations suggest a statistical de - excitation process arising from a thermalized source such as the @xmath0ca cn and are consistent with a previous study at e@xmath8 = 150 mev  @xcite .",
    "the velocity contour maps of the lcp galilean - invariant differential cross sections ( d@xmath34/d@xmath35de)p@xmath36c@xmath36 as a function of the lcp velocity are known to provide an overall picture of the reaction pattern . from this pattern",
    "the velocity of the emission source can be determined in order to better characterize the nature of the reaction mechanism .",
    "such typical plots  @xcite ( not shown here ) can again be understood by assuming a sequential evaporative process and successive emission sources starting with the thermally equilibrated @xmath0ca@xmath24 cn and ending with the final source characterized by a complete freeze - out of the residual nucleus .",
    "the galilean - invariant cross section contours form arcs that are centered at v@xmath37  @xcite , as expected for a complete fusion - evaporation ( cf ) mechanism followed by isotropic evaporation .",
    "the exclusive lcp events are also largely consistent with a cf mechanism with the light particles being in coincidence with er s with z = 15 - 17 .",
    "the data taken with the ic s located at more backward angles ( larger than -15@xmath38 ) are not considered in the following analysis since the statistics for fusion - evaporation events are too low .",
    "the experimental data of figs .",
    "3 and 4 are given by the solid points , with error bars visible when greater than the size of the points .",
    "at e@xmath8 = 180 mev , the spectral shapes of @xmath4 particles in coincidence with p ( z=15 ) er s , shown in fig .  4 ,",
    "are very similar to the inclusive energy spectra of fig .  2 .",
    "on the other hand the energy spectra of @xmath4 particles in coincidence with s ( z=16 ) er s are more complicated as they show other non - evaporative sub - structures ( their angular dependence are indicative of a binary decay origin ) which are superimposed on the  statistical \" maxwellian shape .",
    "these additional non - statistical components will be discussed as arising from a @xmath15be cluster emission in sec .",
    "iv.c . at e@xmath8 = 112 mev , shown in fig .  3 , for z = 15 the high - energy components showing up at the large angles may arise from @xmath4 , 3p evaporation cascades .",
    "5 presents the corresponding @xmath1si + @xmath2c exclusive energy spectra of protons emitted in coincidence with individual er s ( z = 15 and 16 ) at e@xmath8 = 180 mev .",
    "their spectral shapes are also maxwellian with the typical exponential fall - off at high energy , characteristic of a statistical cn decay process .",
    "the in - plane angular correlations of @xmath4 particles and protons in coincidence with er s produced in the @xmath1si + @xmath2c reaction , are shown in figs .  6 and 7 at e@xmath8 = 112 mev and 180 mev , respectively .",
    "the angular correlations are peaked strongly on the opposite side of the beam direction from the er detectors which were located at @xmath39 = -15@xmath38 or @xmath39 = -10@xmath38 for the two energies , respectively .",
    "the observed peaking of the lcp yields on the opposite side of the beam from the ic is the result of momentum conservation .",
    "the angular correlations of both the protons and @xmath4 particles show the same behavior for all er s .",
    "8 displays the out - of - plane angular correlations of @xmath4 particles ( circles ) and protons ( triangles ) in coincidence with individual er s detected at @xmath40 = 10@xmath41 , produced in the @xmath1si(180 mev ) + @xmath2c reaction .",
    "the angular distributions have a behavior following a typical exp(-a@xmath42(@xmath43 ) ) shape  @xcite , with possibly two components visible for @xmath4 particles in coincidence with z = 14 , 15 and 16 , plus a broadening of the angular correlations at backward angles .",
    "this broadening effect may result from @xmath4 particles being able to be emitted at the beginning or at the end of the decay chain , where the angular momentum becomes smaller towards the end of the chain . as the protons can not remove as much angular momentum as do the @xmath4 particles the broadening effect is less significant in the proton angular correlation .",
    "the solid lines shown in the figure are the results of statistical - model predictions for cf and equilibrium decay using the monte carlo evaporation code cacarizo  @xcite , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the evaporation of light particles from a highly excited cn is a well known decay process up to very high excitation energies and spins  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of lcp data requires a careful treatment of the light particle emission properties in the statistical - model description .",
    "most of the available statistical - model computer codes  @xcite are based on the hauser - feshbach formalism and are able to follow the cn decay by a cascade of evaporated lcp s and neutrons",
    ". in particular , a detailed analysis of the exclusive data can be undertaken by the use of monte carlo versions  @xcite of some of these statistical - model codes in which the filtering of the events can reproduce the experimental conditions .",
    "the statistical - model analysis of the present data has been performed using the hauser - feshbach evaporation code cacarizo  @xcite .",
    "cacarizo is a monte carlo version of the statistical - model code cascade  @xcite , which has evolved with many modifications and extensions  @xcite from the original code . in this program",
    "the effective experimental geometry of the icare detectors is properly taken into account .",
    "it is assumed that a single cn is created with a well defined excitation energy and angular momentum distribution , and the de - excitation chain is followed step by step and recorded as an event file .",
    "the generated events are then analyzed using a subsequent filtering code analysis  @xcite in which the locations and the solid angles of all the icare telescopes are explicitly specified .",
    "this program allows the determination of the different types of events of interest .",
    "such events can be sorted ( singles events , coincidence events , etc . ) and the corresponding particle spectra and angular distributions can be created .",
    "the cn angular momentum distributions needed as the primary input for the calculations were specified using the critical angular momentum for fusion l@xmath44 and the diffuseness parameter @xmath45l .",
    "they were taken from er cross section data compiled for the @xmath1si + @xmath2c fusion process by vineyard _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , without including fission competition . a fixed value of @xmath45l = 1@xmath46 ( optimized at low energy by a previous statistical - model analysis of this reaction  @xcite ) was assumed for the calculations .",
    "it has been checked that the calculated spectra are not sensitive to slight changes in the critical angular momentum or to explicit inclusion of the fission competition .",
    "the parameter sets used for the calculations are summarized in table ii .",
    "the other standard ingredients for statistical - model calculations are the formulations of the nuclear level densities and of the barrier transmission probabilities .",
    "the transmission coefficients were derived from optical model ( om ) calculations using potential parameters of light particle induced reactions deduced by wilmore and hodgson  @xcite , perey and perey  @xcite , and huizenga  @xcite for the neutrons , protons and @xmath4 particles , respectively . for spin regions",
    "where the standard rotating liquid drop model ( rldm )  @xcite as well as the finite - range liquid drop model ( frldm )  @xcite still predict essentially spherical shapes , these sets of transmission coefficients have been found adequate in the considered mass region .",
    "however , in recent years it has been observed that when the angular momentum is increased to values for which frldm predicts significant deformations , statistical - model calculations using such standard parameters can not always predict satisfactorily the shape of the evaporated @xmath4-particle energy spectra @xcite .",
    "the calculated average energies of the @xmath4 particles are found to be much higher than the corresponding experimental results .",
    "several attempts have been made to explain this anomaly either by changing the emission barrier or by using spin - dependent level densities .",
    "adjusting the emission barriers and corresponding transmission probabilities affects the lower - energy part of the calculated evaporation spectra . on the other hand",
    "the high - energy part of the spectra depends crucially on the available phase space obtained from the level densities at high spin . in hot rotating nuclei formed in heavy - ion reactions ,",
    "the energy level density at higher angular momentum is spin dependent .",
    "the level density , @xmath47 , for a given angular momentum @xmath48 and energy @xmath49 is given by the well known fermi gas expression with equidistant single - particle levels and a constant level density parameter @xmath50 :    @xmath51^{1/2 } ) \\label{lev}\\ ] ]    where t is the  nuclear \" temperature and @xmath45 is the pairing correction  @xcite . the quantity e@xmath52 = @xmath53j(j+1 ) is the rotational energy , with @xmath54 being the effective moment of inertia , where @xmath55 at high excitation energy and high angular momentum is considered to be the rigid body moment of inertia and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the  deformability parameters \" @xcite .    the level density parameter is constant and is set equal to @xmath50 = a/8 mev@xmath36 , a value which is in agreement with previous works @xcite . in principle , the value of @xmath50 may be affected by dynamical deformation : rotation induces rearrangement of the single - particle level scheme and the altered nuclear surface area  @xcite affects the macroscopic energy of the system .",
    "the @xmath50 parameter becomes more important when the nuclear deformation increases  @xcite .",
    "however , in the present work we assume a constant value and rather introduce deformation effects through the deformability parameters .",
    "a constant value of @xmath50 = a/8 is in agreement with various authors  @xcite , as well as with theoretical studies by shlomo and natowitz  @xcite , by tke and swiatecki  @xcite , and with experimental results obtained very recently in the a@xmath6 = 60 mass region  @xcite .",
    "no attempt was made to modify the transmission coefficients since it has been shown that the effective barrier heights are fairly insensitive to the nuclear deformation  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , by changing the deformability parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 one can simulate the spin - dependent level density  @xcite associated with a larger nuclear deformation , and thus better reproduce the experimental data .      in the present analysis , following the procedure proposed by huizenga _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we empirically modify the phase space open to statistical decay by lowering the yrast line with adjustment of the deformability parameters so as to fit the available experimental data  @xcite .",
    "we may also take into account the fact that the deformation should be attenuated during the subsequent emission processes : i.e. , there is a readjustment of shape of the nascent final nucleus and a change of collective to intrinsic excitation during the particle - evaporation process .",
    "such an analysis was suggested earlier by blann and komoto  @xcite , but with the assumption that the deformation is a frozen degree of freedom through the decay chain .",
    "dynamical effects related to the shape relaxation during the de - excitation process have been incorporated into statistical - model codes  @xcite . for the cacarizo calculations done here , it is assumed that memory of formation details are lost after each step , with only the conserved quantities such as total energy and spin preserved during the decay sequence .",
    "the cacarizo calculations have been performed using two sets of input parameters : the first one with standard liquid drop parameters ( parameter * set a * ) , consistent with the deformation of rldm  @xcite and of frldm with finite - range corrections of sierk  @xcite , and the second one with larger values for the deformability parameters @xcite ( parameter * set b * ) which are listed in table [ table3 ] . in the frldm  @xcite",
    "the cn can be considered as spherical or slightly deformed at low bombarding energy , becoming strongly deformed as the spin increases .    the dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 show the predictions of cacarizo for @xmath1si + @xmath2c at both bombarding energies using the parameter * set a * consistent with frldm deformation  @xcite .",
    "it can be observed that the average energies of the measured @xmath4-particle inclusive spectra are lower than those predicted by these statistical - model calculations .",
    "the solid lines of fig .  2 show the predictions of cacarizo using the same increased values of the spin deformation parameters ( see parameter * set b * given in table ii ) for both energies , and the agreement is considerably improved .",
    "the exclusive energy spectra of the @xmath4 particles in coincidence with individual er s ( z = 15 and z = 16 ) are displayed in figs .  3 and 4 for the two bombarding energies e@xmath8 = 112 mev and 180 mev , respectively .",
    "it can be observed that the spectra in coincidence with the p residues are well reproduced by using the deformation effects  @xcite .",

    "3 and 4 show the predictions of cacarizo using the parameter * set b * with @xmath56 = 2.5 x 10@xmath58 and @xmath57 = 5.0 x 10@xmath59 chosen to reproduce the data consistently at the two bombarding energies . on the other hand , by using the standard liquid drop deformability parameter * set a * with no extra deformation ( i.e. with small values of @xmath60 and @xmath57 ) , the observed average energies from the exclusive @xmath4-particles spectra are , as found for the inclusive data , lower than those predicted @xcite by the statistical model .",
    "in this case the cacarizo parameters are similar to the standard parameters used in a previous study of the 130 mev @xmath12o + @xmath11 mg reaction @xcite , with the use of the angular momentum dependent level densities .    on inspection of figs .",
    "3 and 4 a large difference can be noticed when comparing the calculated and experimental energy spectra associated with s residues and those associated with p er s  @xcite .",

    "an additional , non - statistical , @xmath4-particle component is suggested in section iv.c to arise from a @xmath15be emission process .",

    ", it may be mentioned that the energy spectra of the protons do not shift as significantly as the spin - dependent parametrization of the moment of inertia is introduced .",

    "however , the excess of yields observed at backward angles ( @xmath40 = + 50@xmath41 to + 90@xmath41 ) for @xmath4 particles in coincidence with s may indicate the occurrence of a non - evaporative process , possibly of a binary nature .",

    "the hypothesis of a non - evaporative component arising from the @xmath2c breakup may be advanced .",
    "the solid lines shown in fig .  8 for the out - of - plane angular correlations are the results of cacarizo statistical - model predictions .",
    "once again it can be observed that the statistical - model calculations are able to reproduce the proton coincidences well , but they fail to describe the @xmath4-cl coincidences and the large yields found in coincidence with p and si er s in the most forward direction .",
    "the poor reproduction of the @xmath4-particle experimental anisotropy factor is not well understood .",
    "the angular momentum dependence has been tested by performing calculations with two different angular - momentum windows : 10 - 20@xmath46 and 20 - 30@xmath46 . whereas for protons the anisotropy is almost constant with the l - window , for the @xmath4 particles the anisotropy is strongly depending of the chosen l - window .",
    "nevertheless the flat behavior shown around 0@xmath41 is present for the two particle species .",
    "the observed discrepancy suggests that the assumed angular distribution of the lp , which is handled semi - classically , may not be adequate to describe the out - of - plane data .",
    "overall , we conclude that the evaporated @xmath4 particles from @xmath0ca cn emission reflect significant deformation effects .",

    "the extent to which these effects can be reasonably well quantified is dependent on the experimental coverage and , in particular , on the power of the coincidence trigger .",
    "it is of particular interest to note that the value of @xmath74 @xmath10 0.5 found for the quadrupole deformation parameter of @xmath1si + @xmath2c ( see table iii ) might be connected with the recent observation of sd bands in the doubly - magic @xmath0ca nucleus by standard @xmath70-ray spectroscopy methods  @xcite .",
    "correlating large prolate deformations in the hot cn with the presence of sd bands in @xmath0ca is obviously not straightforward , since the deformation deduced from the lcp data averages over cn configurations , while the sd bands are based on one of these configurations .",
    "we made the same discussion with the possible comparison between lcp results for the @xmath1si + @xmath1si reaction  @xcite and @xmath70-ray data displaying very deformed bands in the doubly magic @xmath76ni nucleus  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to add that the macroscopic deformation energy of @xmath0ca recently calculated within a generalized liquid drop model  @xcite with shell effects ( using the strutinsky method ) generates a second highly deformed minimum where sd and highly deformed states may survive .",
