    "entanglement is the phenomenon that the quantum states of two ( or more ) degrees of freedom are inseparable , and is arguably the most distinct aspect of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "it results in non - classical correlations between observable physical properties of the two subsystems . for _ nonlocal entanglement",
    "_ this concerns two degrees of freedom that are spatially separated over a large distance .",
    "the occurrence of such correlations has been thoroughly tested in several experiments , and the results leave little doubt that quantum theory provides the valid predictions .",
    "experimental realizations were , until now , carried out with pairs of elementary particles or photons @xcite , or with spins in very simple quantum systems as for example trapped ions @xcite or alkali atoms @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to continue research on the controlled realization of nonlocal entanglement with other material systems , in particular with degrees of freedom in solid state .    in part",
    "this interest is fundamental . whether entangled states loose their coherence in a different manner than superposition states of individual degrees of freedom",
    "is still not fully understood @xcite .",
    "recent developments here include an all - optical experiment that showed that entanglement can be lost much more rapidly than the loss of coherence in the two subsystems @xcite .",
    "another interesting result from work with entangled photon pairs showed that the relation between the amount of entanglement and the degree of mixedness of a two - particle state can only be represented by a plane of possibilities .",
    "specific points in this plane depend on the nature of the environment that is decohering the initial maximally - entangled pure state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is still not firmly established that quantum theory does not break down when applied to collective or macroscopic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this justifies a study of how entangled states can be realized in solid state , and how these states loose their coherence : solid state can provide model systems with complex ( collective ) degrees of freedom , or systems with elementary degrees of freedom in a complex environment .",
    "research on the controlled realization of entanglement in solid state systems is also driven by the prospect that it may provide tools for quantum information technologies .",
    "relevant to the discussion here is a proposal for long - distance quantum communication @xcite , that was until now mainly explored with ensembles of alkali atoms @xcite , or alkali - atom - like impurities in solids ( refs .",
    "@xcite and related articles in this issue ) .",
    "however , widespread implementation favors a technique that can be implemented in micron - scale devices that fit inside optical fibers , which are compatible with high - speed opto - electronic operation @xcite . here ,",
    "the electronic and optical properties of iii - v semiconductors outperform the atomic or impurity - based systems .",
    "the coherence times of degrees of freedom in these materials , however , tend to be too short for any realization of quantum information technology in the near future , but are long enough for initial experimental studies on entangled states .",
    "we discuss here a technique that enables the controlled realization of nonlocal entanglement between spin - wave modes in ensembles of conduction - band electrons , which are located in two spatially separated pieces of gaas semiconductor material .",
    "we also outline the material properties of a gaas quantum well system where this technique can be implemented . in section  [ sec : entangle ] we discuss an approach where quantum - optical measurement techniques are used for preparing entangled states of spin degrees of freedom in ensembles of three - level quantum systems . subsequently , in section  [ sec : gaasmatter ] , we present a gaas heterostructure material that is suited for realizing such an ensemble of three - level quantum systems .",
    "we propose here to use the so - called dlcz scheme @xcite for preparing nonlocal entanglement with solid state devices .",
    "the main idea behind this approach is that spontaneous emission of a quantum optical pulse results in quantum correlations ( entanglement ) between the state of the optical pulse and the state of the system that emits . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider a two - level system that is initially in its excited state @xmath0 .",
    "it is emitting a single photon while relaxing to its ground state @xmath1 .",
    "if we would be able to have control over this process such that it relaxes to a superposition of the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the system would emit an optical pulse that is a superposition of the states with 0 and 1 photon , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the quantum state of the system and the optical pulse are then in fact entangled , and the only pure states that can describe the state of the combined system are of the form @xmath6 .",
    "such control over spontaneous emission can be realized with a three - level raman system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : entangle]a ) .",
    "when this system is initially in the state @xmath1 , there will be only spontaneous emission of a raman photon from the transition @xmath7 while a control field is driving the @xmath8 transition .",
    "figure  [ fig : entangle]b illustrates how an extension of this scheme can be used to entangle the states of two three - level systems that are at different locations .",
    "say alice and bob both have an identical version of such a three - level system prepared in the state @xmath1 .",
    "they both use a classical field to drive the @xmath8 transition , in order to get very weak spontaneous emission from the @xmath9 transition , such that each system emits an optical pulse that is a superposition of the photon - number states @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( note that each of these pulses is then entangled with the system that emitted it ) .",
    "the timing and propagation of these two pulses should be controlled such that they arrive at the same time at a measurement station , that consists of a 50/50 beam splitter with a photon counter at each of its two output channels . if the number of photons in the pulses are now measured after combining the two pulses on the beam splitter , there is some probability that one of the two detectors counts 1 photon and the other 0 photons . in that case",
    ", the total number of spin flips in the two three - level systems is 1 , but it is impossible to tell which of the two emitted the photon . as a result , the systems of alice and bob have been projected onto an entangled state of the form @xmath12 ( where the phase @xmath13 can be derived from experimental conditions @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : entangle]b depicts in fact emission from ensembles of three level systems .",
    "for weak ( slightly detuned ) driving of the @xmath8 transition , the expectation value for the total number of @xmath7 photons emitted by an ensemble of identical three - level systems can still be less than 1 photon .",
    "notably , the spin excitation is then not stored on an individual three - level system .",
    "instead , it is stored as a spin - wave mode ( collective spin excitation ) in this medium , with each three - level system having its spin flipped only by a very small amount .",
    "thus , one can also use this approach for preparing entanglement between spin - wave modes in two different ensembles .",
    "these ensembles should have a long elongated shape that is co - linear with the driving field .",
    "an important advantage of using such ensembles is that spontaneous emission becomes highly directional @xcite , with emission predominantly co - propagating with the driving field . in principle",
    "the system will emit very weak in all directions , but an initial spontaneous emission event ( extremely weak , far below the single - photon level ) is strongly amplified ( gain ) when it",
    "co - propagates with the driving field @xcite . for very weak driving",
    ", the total energy in all of the spontaneous emission can still be at the single - photon level , and the gain then ensures that emission into the desired direction is exponentially stronger than into other directions .",
    "thus , the collection efficiency for the total number of emitted photons by such ensembles can be near unity .",
    "this removes the need for using high - finesse optical cavities as in cavity - qed experiments , which is technically very demanding @xcite .    .",
    "the transition between two low - energy spin states @xmath14 and @xmath15 under spontaneous emission of a signal photon from the transition @xmath16 ( with energy @xmath17 ) can be controlled with an optical field ( tuned to photon energy @xmath18 ) driving the transition @xmath8 .",
    "the two legs can be selectively addressed using the optical frequency difference or their dependence on the polarization of the fields . *",
    "b ) * scheme for entangling the states of spin - wave modes in two different spin ensembles , see the text for details.,width=321 ]    one should also be able to confirm that entangled states have been prepared by reading out the states of each ensemble of a pair that has been entangled .",
    "correlations between the spin excitations in the two ensembles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : entangle]b ) can be studied with an optical readout scheme that uses the inverse of the initial raman transition . for each system separately , the number of flipped spins in its ensemble can be measured using a control field that is now driving the @xmath19 transition .",
    "this converts the spin state that is stored in an ensemble into the state of an highly - directional optical pulse ( again a superposition of photon - number states @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) that results from a subsequent @xmath20 transition .",
    "this process fully returns the spin excitation into the @xmath21 state .",
    "the detection should now directly count the number of photons in the emission from the ensemble that is measured ( not using a configuration with a beam splitter ) .",
    "each of the two ensembles should be measured separately in this manner .",
    "if the two ensembles were prepared in a state of the form @xmath12 , the number of detected photons from the ensemble of alice can be 0 or 1 , each with probability @xmath22 .",
    "however , for either measurement outcome , subsequent measurement of the number of photons emitted by bob s ensemble must yield that it is perfectly anti - correlated with the result of alice .",
    "such measurements can already provide evidence for the quantum nature of these correlations ( in particular , the variance of these photon - count correlations should show strong sub - poissonian statistics @xcite ) .",
    "however , it does not yet allow for a formal test of bell inequalities ( testing for non - classical correlations ) , since this requires the ability to rotate the basis in which the state of each of the two - level systems is measured ( with respect to the basis defined by @xmath23 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "this can not be performed directly with a readout technique based on photon - number measurements . to overcome this , the observation of entanglement between two ensembles of alkali atoms @xcite used an approach where a local phase shift was applied to one of the two systems , either to the optical signal pulse from readout @xcite or to the stored spin excitation .",
    "however , the readout then requires once more to combine the signal pulses from readout of the two ensembles on a beam splitter , and to study the interference fringe that results from the local phase shift . a scheme that only relies on local readout of each ensemble",
    "can be realized when the states of both alice and bob are not stored in a single ensemble but in a pair of ensembles @xcite .",
    "the photon - number readout can then be implemented with a certain setting for a phase difference between the states of these two ensembles . however , both of these approaches require that the path length between the ensembles and detector stations are stabilized with interferometric precision .",
    "an alternative more robust approach could be realized with alkali atom ensembles @xcite and used the fact that in these systems the states @xmath24 and @xmath25 consist of multiple ( degenerate ) zeeman sublevels . how a spin excitation is distributed over these zeeman sublevels",
    "is then mapped onto two orthogonal polarizations of a signal field , and polarization selective readout then enables to rotate the basis in which signal fields are measured .",
    "other solutions that are technically even less demanding are currently investigated @xcite .    applying this quantum - optical measurement scheme for preparing entangled states in spatially separated electronic devices",
    "is an interesting alternative to related research that uses electronic control and measurement techniques .",
    "activities here use for example electron spins in quantum hall states @xcite or quantum dots @xcite , or superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "a first advantage of this quantum optical approach is that it naturally allows for having the two devices separated by a large distance , whereas for electronic control coherent interactions are typically limited to short distances .",
    "more importantly , it allows one to use photon - number detection .",
    "this is a unique quantum measurement tool in the sense that projective measurement can be used for preparing states with very high fidelity .",
    "tools for electronic readout have typically much higher noise levels , which results in a much weaker correlation between a measurement outcome and the state of the quantum system immediately after measurement .",
    "we now discuss how such an ensemble of three - level systems can be implemented in a gaas quantum well system .",
    "the techniques presented in the previous section have been mainly developed and explored with ensembles of alkali atoms @xcite , and developing a realization in solid state can thus be viewed as an attempt to mimic an ensemble of alkali atoms .",
    "the key properties of the three - level system as in fig .",
    "[ fig : entangle]a are then that the splitting @xmath27 is homogeneous for an ensemble , and that superpositions of @xmath1 and @xmath28 have a long coherence time @xmath29 . further , these two states @xmath1 and @xmath0 must both have a strong optical transition to a common excited state @xmath30 that can be addressed selectively . for each leg the spontaneous emission life time must be much shorter than @xmath29 , a requirement that overlaps with conditions for electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "transient signatures of electromagnetically induced transparency were already observed in related work using excitons in undoped gaas quantum wells ( ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we propose here to realize an ensemble of three - level systems with an @xmath31-doped gaas quantum well system , building on seminal work by imamoglu @xcite .",
    "these @xmath31-doped gaas materials combine relatively long coherence times for electron spin superposition states ( @xmath32 @xcite ) , with strong optical transitions across the gap that obey good selection rules @xcite .",
    "transitions between the highest valence band states and lowest conduction band states follow the selection rules for transitions between a @xmath33 and @xmath34 manifold @xcite , as represented for bulk gaas in fig .",
    "[ fig : selrules]a .",
    "the continuous density of states for bulk gaas develops into an atom - like discrete set of levels when a two - dimensional electron system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : selrules]b ) is brought into the quantum hall regime by applying a strong magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : selrules]c ) , because the electrons then condense into cyclotron orbits .",
    "the number of these so - called landau levels that are filled at a certain magnetic field defines the filling factor @xmath35 , where each spin - resolved landau level is counted individually ( it can be shown that @xmath35 equals the ratio of areal electron density and areal density of flux quantums @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the quantum hall state at filling factor @xmath36 , where the conduction - band landau levels are fully spin polarized . at @xmath36 , the lowest landau level ( further denoted as @xmath1 )",
    "is fully occupied , while all higher landau levels are fully unoccupied .",
    "the density of states for the valance band is now also a discrete set of landau levels that are all fully filled .",
    "note that we assume that the magnetic field is in the @xmath37-direction , in order to have fig .",

    "[ fig : entangle]a ( in gaas the electron g - factor is negative ) .    the system as sketched in fig .",

    "these both have , for example , an optical transition to the valance - band @xmath38 state , as the selection rules only allow for transitions with @xmath39 . for gaas quantum well systems , selective addressing of these two optical transitions must rely on polarization selection rules , since the zeeman splitting for the conduction - band electrons is not in excess of the narrowest line width that can be obtained for optical transitions . in practice , the narrowest lines ( @xmath40 ) can be obtained for a quantum well width of @xmath41 @xcite , while the electron g - factor @xmath42 @xcite .",

    "these effects , however , can be used for implementing a more convenient control scheme , where the three - level system is formed by @xmath1 , @xmath28 and the highest landau level in the valence band .",

    "the analogy with fig .",
    "[ fig : entangle]a is more evident when describing the process in terms of holes @xcite .",
