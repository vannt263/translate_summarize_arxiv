    "many - body perturbation theory is a convenient tool to estimate the correlation energy of molecular systems .",
    "usually , one calculates an estimate for the correlation energy by term - by - term summation of the mller - plesset ( mp ) series @xmath4 as a partial sum @xmath5 that is usually denoted by mp@xmath1 .",
    "but this approximate value does not optimally exploit the information content of the terms @xmath6 of the mp series .",
    "better estimates can be obtained by using convergence acceleration or extrapolation methods to sum the perturbation series , as for instance pad approximants or methods based on effective characteristic polynomials .",
    "the method of effective characteristic polynomials has been introduced by ek and coworkers recently .",
    "it has been applied to the summation of the divergent perturbation series of anharmonic oscillators @xcite and to correlation energies of model systems .",
    "extensions of the method for the simultaneous treatment of several perturbation series have recently been proposed @xcite but this will not be considered in the following .    if only perturbation energies up to the fourth order are available then one can use the @xmath2 estimator @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 estimator is obtained as a root of a second - degree effective characteristic polynomial .",
    "the coefficients of this polynomial are related to the terms of the perturbation series .",
    "the @xmath2 estimator can be calculated easily from the terms @xmath7 of the mp series and is size - extensive . as is well - known",
    ", the latter property is important for the treatment of larger systems . for a series of benchmark systems the @xmath2 estimator proved to be relatively accurate as compared to a number of other estimators @xcite .",
    "analogous estimators @xmath0 can be derived from effective characteristic polynomials of higher degrees @xmath1 . in the present contribution ,",
    "we sketch the method of effective characteristic polynomials , basically to fix notation .",
    "then , it is proved that the estimators @xmath0 for @xmath3 are also size - extensive if the underlying perturbation theory is size - extensive , as is the case for the mp series .",
    "in this section , we sketch the method of the effective characteristic polynomials .",
    "the characteristic polynomial @xmath8 of degree @xmath1 in the unknown energy @xmath9 has in the linear variation method the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 are @xmath1 orthonormal basis functions , and @xmath12 is the hamiltonian .",
    "if the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath13 , the polynomial has the form ( @xcite , eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) ) @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "this leaves @xmath16 coefficients @xmath17 to be determined where @xmath18 . in the method of the characteristic polynomial",
    ", they are obtained from the coefficients @xmath6 of the perturbation series for @xmath9 @xmath19 since @xmath20 for an eigenvalue @xmath9 , one demands @xmath21 this means that the first @xmath22 coeffients of the taylor series ( in @xmath23 ) of the left - hand side of this equation , i.e. up to the coefficient of @xmath24 , all have to vanish .",
    "this yields a linear equation system for the unknown @xmath17 .",
    "we assume in the following that this linear equation system yields a unique solution for the coefficients @xmath17 .",
    "after the determination of the coefficients , the effective characteristic polynomial is fixed and also denoted by @xmath25(e)$ ] in order to make the dependence on the terms @xmath6 explicit . the effective characteristic equation @xmath26(e)=0 $ ] may then be solved for @xmath9 .",
    "the lowest root is called @xmath27 $ ] or , more simply , @xmath0 , if the values of the @xmath6 are plain from the context .    in the case",
    "@xmath28 one obtains for @xmath29 the simple expression @xmath30^{{1/2}}\\>.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "consider a supersystem composed of @xmath31 identical , non - interacting subsystems .",
    "then , the true energy of the supersystem is the @xmath31-fold of the energy of a single subsystem .",
    "an approximate method for the computation of the energy is called size - extensive if the approximate energy for the supersystem is the @xmath31-fold of the approximate energy of a single subsystem .",
    "it is well - known that mp perturbation theory is size - extensive order by order .",
    "this means that for all @xmath32 the @xmath33-th order term of the perturbation series for the supersystem equals @xmath34 if the @xmath33-th order term of the perturbation series of a single subsystem is @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that the mp@xmath33 estimator is size - extensive for each order @xmath33 .    in order to prove size - extensitivity of the @xmath0 estimators with @xmath3 ,",
    "one thus has to show that for each @xmath1 and @xmath31 the equation @xmath36 = m \\,\\pi n[e_0,\\dots , e_{l}]\\ ] ] holds where , as before , @xmath37 .    for given @xmath31 and @xmath1 and for given @xmath38 and @xmath23",
    ", we can consider the @xmath17 and hence , also the effective characteristic polynomial @xmath39(e)=\\sum_{j=0}^{n } e^j \\,\\sum_{k=0}^{n - j } f_{n , j , k } \\beta^k\\ ] ] as known .",
    "we introduce a new polynomial by @xmath40(e / m ) \\label{newpola}\\\\                & = & \\sum_{j=0}^{n } e^j \\,\\sum_{k=0}^{n - j }                [ f_{n , j , k } m^{n - j } ] \\beta^k \\label{newpolb}\\>.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ newpola ] ) defines the polynomial , while eq .",
    "( [ newpolb ] ) shows that @xmath41 can also be regarded as an effective characteristic polynomial with new coefficients @xmath42 .",
    "note that @xmath43 holds as required .    since @xmath44(e_0+\\beta \\,e_1 + \\beta^2 e_2 + \\dots ) \\nonumber \\\\   & = & o(\\beta^{l+1})\\>,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the polynomial @xmath41 is identical to the effective characteristic polynomial for the energies @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46(e / m ) = p_n[m\\,e_0,\\dots , m\\,e_{l}](e)\\>.\\ ] ]",
    "thus , the complete pattern of roots is scaled by @xmath31 , since if @xmath47 is any root of @xmath26(e)$ ] then @xmath48 is a root of @xmath49(e)$ ] . but",
    "this proves eq .",
    "( [ toprove ] ) since @xmath50 $ ] is a root of @xmath26(e)$ ] .",
    "size - extensitivity is an important property that is helpful for obtaining reliable energy estimates for larger systems .",
    "it is hoped that correlation energy estimates on the basis of effective characteristic polynomials become more widespread since they offer a conceptually and computationally relatively simple but accurate computational tool as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "only the mp series has to be computed , and its terms be combined to obtain an effective characteristic polynomial and the correlation energy as one of its roots as in eq .",
    "( [ eqp2 ] ) .",
    "some error control is possible by comparison to some other methods for convergence acceleration of the perturbation series @xcite .",
    "an extension of the method was proposed by the author in @xcite .",
    "it allows to combine information from the terms of several short perturbation expansions for a small number of states .",
    "these simultaneous perturbation series can also be used for the construction of a characteristic polynomial . in this way , the somewhat demanding relation between the degree of the characteristic polynomial and the maximal order of the perturbation calculation is largely avoided .",
    "applications of this extended method and a proof of its size - extensitivity are currently under investigation .",
