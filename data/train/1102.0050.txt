    "dynamics in strong fields has been an interesting subject in theoretical physics .",
    "recently , this subject is being paid attention also in the experimental physics of creation of the quark gluon plasma . in high - energy heavy - ion collision experiments , at the so - called glasma stage  @xcite just after the collision , longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields are expected to be produced in the context of the color glass condensate of order @xmath0@xmath1 gev in rhic and @xmath2 gev in lhc . in the peripheral collision , a strong magnetic field of order @xmath3 mev",
    "would be induced .",
    "the question is how the strong fields decay and the system is thermalized .    in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on how the strong fields decay into particles . for this purpose",
    ", we first briefly review the schwinger mechanism in the coexistence of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we will point out that the vacuum immediately decays in the case of massless fermion and nonzero @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case that the electric and magnetic fields are covariantly constant  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath6=[d_\\mu,\\bm{b}]=\\bm{0}$ ] , where @xmath7 is the covariant derivative with the gauge field @xmath8 .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are defined as @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11/g$ ] .",
    "this is a generalization of constant fields in qed , @xmath12 , to the non - abelian fields .",
    "for the covariantly constant fields , all the components of @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be diagonalized to be constant matrices in color space by a gauge transformation . without loss of generality",
    ", one can also set @xmath13 and @xmath14 by choosing an appropriate lorentz frame and the coordinate axis .",
    "the vacuum decay in an electric field was discussed by  @xcite .",
    "consider the vacuum persistency probability , which is defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are infinite space volume and time length . @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath19 are the in - vacuum and the out - vacuum defined at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "if the vacuum is unstable , @xmath22 has a nonzero value , while , if the vacuum is stable , @xmath22 vanishes .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 denotes magnitude of the vacuum decay per unit volume and time .",
    "when @xmath22 is small , @xmath23 , so that @xmath22 is regarded as the pair production probability per unit volume and time .    for qcd , the analytic formula of @xmath22 for the quark - pair creation in the covariantly constant",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the quark - mass matrix and the trace is taken over the indices of color and flavor .",
    "this is a non - abelian extension of the following formula for qed  @xcite : @xmath26 with the qed coupling constant @xmath27 .",
    "note that the fermion pair creation formalism in the covariantly constant fields in qcd is similar to that in qed , so that we hereafter give the formula for qed , where we set @xmath28 and @xmath29 by a suitable axis choice and the parity transformation .    in the absence of the magnetic field",
    ", this formula reduces to the well - known result , @xmath30 if the masses are zero , @xmath22 has a _",
    "finite _ value of @xmath31 .",
    "the situation changes if the magnetic field exists . from eq .",

    "( [ eq : w ] ) , we obtain for small @xmath25 as @xmath32 as @xmath33 , @xmath22 logarithmically diverges as @xmath34    next , let us consider the origin of the divergence of @xmath22 in terms of effective dimensional reduction in a strong magnetic field .",
    "when a magnetic field exists , the spectrum of the transverse direction is discretized by landau quantization .",
    "actually , the energy spectrum for @xmath35=0 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 correspond to the landau levels , and @xmath38 is the spin .",
    "the system effectively becomes @xmath39 dimensional system with infinite tower of massive state : @xmath40 .",
    "for the lowest landau level ( lll ) , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the energy is @xmath43 .",
    "this is the spectrum in @xmath39 dimensions .",
    "this lll causes the divergence of @xmath22 as will be shown below .",
    "the divergence of @xmath22 does not mean the divergence of the infinite pair production per unit space - time .",
    "the divergence of @xmath22 rather implies that the vacuum always decays and produces pairs of fermion .",
    "the question is where the vacuum goes . in the coexistence of @xmath44 and @xmath35",
    ", one can obtain the probability of the @xmath45 pairs of fermion with lll as @xmath46 .",

    "this probability is finite only if the following equation is satisfied : @xmath49 therefore , the number of the particle with the lll is restricted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : finiteprobabilitycondition ] ) , and linearly increases with time .",
    "the higher landau levels give heavy effective masses of order @xmath50 , so that all the contributions to the pair productions from such modes are suppressed .",
    "the total number of the particle pairs can be calculated : @xmath51 at @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the contribution of lll is obtained as @xmath54 which is equal to taking @xmath55 in eq .",

    "the solid line denotes the contribution from the lll , and the dotted line denotes the contribution from all modes . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : totalnumber ] , the total number of the particle for the full contribution and lll contribution are shown .",
    "the lll dominates for @xmath56 , so that the effective model for the lll works well for @xmath56 .",
    "in this section , we study particle productions coming from the lll for qed taken into account the back reaction . for this purpose , we consider lll projected theory , that is , the wave function of the fermion is projected to the lll state .",
    "the wave function of the lll is @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the angular momentum in @xmath59 direction for the lll , and the energy is degenerate for @xmath58 .",
    "one can decompose the fermion field into the longitudinal mode and the transverse mode in a suitable representation as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the two component dirac field in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "then the fermion action of qed in @xmath62 dimensions reduces to that of non - abelian gauge theory in @xmath39 dimensions : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the gamma matrices in @xmath39 dimensions and @xmath66 .",
    "the covariant derivative is defined by @xmath67 with @xmath68 @xmath69 corresponds to the gauge field in @xmath70 gauge theory , since @xmath69 is an hermite matrix , @xmath71 , and the indices @xmath58 and @xmath72 run from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "to simplify the situation , we assume that the @xmath75 and @xmath76 do not depend on the transverse directions , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "then the @xmath58 dependence can be factorized out : @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the action in eq .",
    "( [ eq : action ] ) becomes @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the volume of the transverse directions .",
    "this action is nothing but that in 1 + 1 qed , i.e. , the schwinger model , except for the overall factor @xmath83 .",

    "@xmath87 denotes the effective photon mass , @xmath88 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : effectiveaction ] ) is manifestly gauge invariant . in the lorenz gauge",
    ", it reduces to the result by @xcite .",
    "the mass @xmath87 is induced by the axial anomaly , of which effect is called `` dynamical higgs effect . ''",
    "this mass generation is related to the fact @xmath89 as @xmath33 . using this form",
    ", we can calculate the fermion and axial currents , @xmath90 where we choose the lorenz gauge , @xmath91 .",
    "the divergence of the axial current leads the axial anomaly in @xmath39 dimensions except for the overall factor @xmath92 : @xmath93 this relation is nothing but axial anomaly in @xmath62 dimensions . since the effective action in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effectiveaction ] ) has a quadratic form in @xmath94 , the equation of motion for the photon can be solved .",
    "for example , the electric field of @xmath59 direction is @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "the currents satisfy @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we show the electric field and the number density for the spatially homogeneous case , @xmath99 , as a function of time in fig .",

    "@xmath101 , but @xmath102 .",
    "the number density of pairs is equal to @xmath103 .",
    "these results agree with the previous works  @xcite .",
    "the generalization to non - abelian theories is straight forward if the magnetic field is enough strong .",
    "the fermion determinant becomes wess - zumino - witten action .",
    "in this work , we have discussed the vacuum decay in strong electric and magnetic fields . when the fermion is massless , the vacuum persistency probability per unit time and volume becomes zero , and hence @xmath22 diverges .",
    "the origin of the divergence is from discretized spectra of transverse directions and the lowest landau level .",
    "the lll level dominates for @xmath56 . with the lll projection ,",
    "we have analytically calculated the effective action in this situation , and reproduced the previous numerical results .",
    "since the effective theory of the lll is solvable , there is no chaotic behavior nor thermalization .",
    "the thermalization does not happen in the lll - dominant process .    in the case of qcd ,",
    "the gluon is more interesting because of its self - interaction .",
    "the landau quantization causes instability because the helicity of gluon is one .",
    "inserting @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , the energy becomes imaginary when @xmath105 , of which instability is known as nielsen - olesen instability .",
    "the situation is similar to quenching phenomenon in general phase transition , where a temperature suddenly changes .",
    "in such a situation , a phase separation occurs .",
    "the same phenomena would happen in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , because the electric and magnetic fields are suddenly induced by the collision , and the perturbative vacuum of gluon is unstable .",
