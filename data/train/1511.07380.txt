    "the particle identity of the dark matter ( dm ) is among the most pressing questions confronting particle physics today .",
    "it is clear that dm requires an extension of the standard model ( sm ) and it is likely that an understanding of how dm fits into the context of the sm will offer hints about the underlying structure which gave rise to it .    among its most mysterious properties of dm",
    "is the fact that it is long - lived , either being exactly stable or with a lifetime of order that of the universe itself .",
    "its observational properties are incompatible with it possessing either of the known exactly conserved gauge charges , and thus one would naively expect it to decay quickly .",
    "the fact that it is massive and yet ( at least to very good approximation ) stable provides an important clue about its identity , suggesting that some kind of symmetry is in operation .",
    "it is tempting to postulate a connection with the accidental symmetries of the sm , baryon and lepton number , as these are also thought to explain the surprisingly long lifetime of the proton .",
    "indeed , the past years have seen an increase in interest of models gauging @xmath2 baryon motivated by the proton s lifetime , with early constructions @xcite paving the way to more complete models @xcite .",
    "already , this idea was found in some constructions to lead naturally to theories including dm candidates @xcite .",
    "extending this idea , in @xcite a model unifying gauged baryon number and color into a single non - abelian gauge group was constructed .",
    "the theory is based on the gauge symmetry @xmath0 , with the sm quarks forming quadruplets together with new colorless  quark partner \" fields which obtain vector - like masses after @xmath1 breaking .",
    "the quark partners of the right - handed up - type quarks are sm gauge singlets and have suitable properties to play the role of dm .",
    "if the mass of the lightest of such states is chosen to be a few gev and the gauge structure is supplemented by additional uv interactions , a picture in which the dm number density is determined by a primordial particle - anti - particle asymmetry connected to the asymmetry in baryon number can be realized .",
    "this asymmetric limit is interesting , but also has a few weak points .",
    "the quark partners have their own analogue of yukawa interactions , and thus generically one would not expect the notion of flavor in both the quark and quark partner sectors to be aligned , opening the door for large contributions to flavor - changing neutral currents mediated by the gev mass dm particle . the need for at least one of the quark partners to have a gev scale mass",
    "precludes the invocation of symmetry - based arguments such as minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) @xcite as a remedy .",
    "perhaps even more unwieldy is the need to introduce an additional sector of light states into which the dm can annihilate ( or live with extreme tuning of parameters ) to deplete its primordial symmetric component , a generic issue for models of asymmetric dm @xcite .",
    "these concerns are largely ameliorated if the dm is much heavier and its density is symmetric , resulting from its interactions with the sm quarks freezing out at much higher temperatures . while no longer trying to motivate the observed correspondence between the observed densities of dm and baryons in the universe , such a limit arises naturally when baryon number and color unify , without the need for ad hoc assumptions or additional ingredients . in the current work ,",
    "we abandon the connection to the baryon asymmetry and consider the @xmath1 model in the limit where all of the quark partners have masses on the order of the @xmath1 breaking scale .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing constraints ( derived in @xcite for structurally similar leptoquark models ) suggest that even in this limit flavor is generically a problem unless there is sufficient alignment between the quark and quark partner yukawa interactions .",
    "as detailed below , we invoke mfv , which results in sufficient alignment for the the first two generations such that @xmath3@xmath4 constraints allow for quark partners with tev scale masses .",
    "the result is a variant of models where the dm is  top - flavored \" @xcite , leading to interesting and distinct phenomenology .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] , we review the unification of baryon number with color , focusing on the features most important for dm . in section  [ sec : dm ] we compute the rates of annihilation of the dm candidate , as well as its scattering with heavy nuclei , allowing us to identify the regions in which we expect the correct relic density ( assuming a standard cosmology ) and constraints from the null searches for direct detection of dm .",
    "section  [ sec : lhc ] is devoted to a brief review of the associated collider signals .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we provide a brief summary of the most important features of the model for dm and its interactions ( for more details see @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we analyze a recently proposed extension of the standard model based on the @xmath0 gauge group , in which baryon number is interpreted as the fourth color and dark matter emerges as a neutral partner of the ordinary quarks under @xmath1 . we show that under well - motivated minimal flavor - violating assumptions the particle spectrum contains a heavy dark matter candidate which is dominantly the partner of the right - handed top quark . assuming a standard cosmology , the correct thermal relic density through freeze - out is obtained for dark matter masses around 2  3 tev . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the constraints and future prospects for direct and indirect searches for dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss the lhc phenomenology , which is rich in top quark signatures , and investigate the prospects for discovery at a 100 tev hadron collider . </S>"
