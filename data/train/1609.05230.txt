    "to investigate the effect of lattice stability assessment on the predicted phase diagrams , we started by an _ ab - initio _ screening of ordered stoichiometric structures via the high - throughput framework  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pure elements in the hcp and bcc structures and special quasirandom structures ( sqs ) for the bcc @xcite and hcp @xcite structures were computed to estimate the excess formation enthalpies of the corresponding solid solutions .",
    "the _ ab - initio _ otal energy calculations were carried out employing the vasp software within the aflow standard for material structure calculations @xcite .",
    "complete information about the over 200 ordered structures calculated per system , including initial and relaxed structures and detailed calculation specifications , can be obtained in the open access aflowlib materials data repository @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the excess gibbs energy at elevated temperatures , i.e. the vibrational free energy , was considered according to the gibbs methodology @xcite in the quasiharmonic debye model .",
    "the electronic and magnetic excess contributions to the gibbs energy are expected to be much smaller in these systems and are therefore neglected .",
    "the computed excess energies for the two phases were fitted to a sub - subregular model @xmath10 } & & \\label{equation5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to retrieve the redlich - kister coefficients that describe the excess energy over the entire composition and temperature range .",
    "these coefficients were used within the thermo - calc software @xcite to compute two phase diagrams for each binary system , one using the lattice stability of the pure elements taken directly from the sgte database @xcite , and the second using the adjusted lattice stability values guided by the _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "all total energy calculations were carried out employing the vasp @xcite and the wien2k @xcite software packages .",
    "the high - throughput screening of over 200 structures per system identified no stable structures in the nb - ti , v - ti and ta - ti systems , in agreement with the experimental data that includes no intermetallic compounds in these systems . on the other hand , many ordered structures with negative formation enthalpies were found in the mo - ti system , of which 6 are identified as potential stable compounds .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] presents these results for the various ordered structures as well as for the bcc- and hcp - sqs .",
    "the complete information about all the structures can be found in the open access aflow materials data repository @xcite .",
    "the gibbs energy for a specific solid solution structure is obtained from the energies of the pure elements in the same structure , and the corresponding configuration and excess energies ( equation ( [ equation1 ] ) ) .",
    "figure [ figure2 ] shows the excess energies of the bcc and hcp structures as a function of alloy composition computed from the dft total energies of the pure elements and the sqs .",
    "they are fitted to redlich - kister polynomials of the fourth degree ( equation ( [ equation5 ] ) ) @xcite to describe the energies at all compositions as a function of temperature .",
    "the dft results obtained from the vasp and wien2k calculations are very close .",
    "both yield strong attraction for the hcp phases , but weaker attractions and in some cases even repulsive interactions for the bcc phases .",
    "this picture remains when the contribution of the vibrational energy is taken into account , the excess energies are barely affected in three of the examined systems and only a minor effect emerges in the fourth one .",
    "table [ table1 ] summarizes the interaction energy coefficients between the tm and ti atoms for both phases , as retrieved from the fitted sub - subregular model .        .",
    "the redlich - kister coefficients obtained for the sub - subregular model of the temperature dependent excess energies of the tm - ti systems . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]        as can be seen from table [ table2 ] , both approaches show that the bcc structure is more stable for the tm elements and the hcp structure is more stable for ti , in agreement with the experimental and computational data @xcite .",
    "however , in all of these cases the stability level computed by the dft is higher .",
    "the difference in lattice stability is quite small for ti ( @xmath110.04 ev / at ) , but significant for the bcc - elements .",
    "these differences would be of little effect in ideal systems , where the attractions between the elements are relatively small .",
    "but , as shown in figure [ figure2 ] , in the cases examined here , the interaction between the tm and ti is strong , especially in the hcp phase .",
    "figures [ figure3 ] and [ figure4 ] show the thermodynamic properties of the tm - ti systems computed with the empirical set of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , taken directly from the sgte ( [ figure3]a and [ figure4]a ) and with the computationally guided set ( [ figure3]b and [ figure4]b ) .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] presents the gibbs energies of the tm - ti alloys in the hcp and the bcc structures at 882@xmath14c .",
    "it is well established that above this transition temperature of ti from hcp to bcc , bcc is the stable phase for the entire concentration range of these alloy systems @xcite .",
    "however , using the sgte values for @xmath12 and @xmath13 we find ( figure [ figure3]a ) that the hcp solid solutions are more stable than the bcc solutions near 20 at % of ti .",
    "this contradiction disappears using the computationally adjusted @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( figure [ figure3]b ) .",
    "the binary phase diagrams for these tm - ti systems were computed using the thermo - calc software , with the excess energies from table [ table1 ] and the two sets of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( figure [ figure4 ] ) . here again , unreasonable results are obtained with the empirical set . as can be seen in figure [ figure4]a ,",
    "a stable hcp compound emerges around 20 at% of ti . for the mo - ti system , which requires the largest dft adjustment ( addition of 0.312 ev / at to @xmath15 of the sgte ) the hcp compound seems to be stable up to 5000@xmath14c",
    "obviously , this result is wrong .",
    "the computational set of @xmath12 and @xmath13 leads to realistic results , as shown in figure [ figure4]b . for the mo - ti , ta - ti and nb - ti systems ,",
    "the computed phase diagrams reproduce the known structural features of the experimental phase diagrams at temperatures above 500@xmath14c @xcite , i.e. a stable bcc solid solution over most compositions and a narrow bcc - hcp phase separation at the ti - rich side . at low temperatures ,",
    "the wide bcc - hcp phase separation is also reproduced in the ta - ti , nb - ti and v - ti systems , and unobserved new compounds are predicted in the mo - ti system below 200@xmath14c . these predicted structures likely escaped detection until now due to the slow diffusion toward equilibrium at those low temperatures . at intermediate temperatures ,",
    "the characteristics of the solvus between the phase separation regime and the solid solution region support those experimental reports @xcite that find a phase separation hump between two stable bcc phases defined by monotectoid points .",
    "the monotonic solvus reported by other studies @xcite should therefore be replaced by this more complex structure .    in the ti - v system",
    ", the predicted bcc phase separation hump has a critical temperature of @xmath111200@xmath14c and a monotectoid temperature at @xmath11200@xmath14c .",
    "one version of the experimental phase diagram shows the same features but with a critical temperature of @xmath11850@xmath14c and a monotectoid temperature at @xmath11675@xmath14c , while another version reports a monotonically decreasing solvus temperature with increasing vanadium concentration @xcite .",
    "the calculated phase diagram clearly favors the complex solvus structure .",
    "its features are , however , quite sensitive to the interaction between the pure elements",
    ". a reduction of merely 5 mev / at of the attractive and repulsive interactions at 700k would eliminate the inflection point shown in figure [ figure3]b and reduce the critical temperature from 1200@xmath14c to the experimental value of 850@xmath14c .",
    "such a reduction may be achieved by a more accurate modeling of the vibrational energy , rather than the quasiharmonic debye model used here .",
    "the determination of phase diagrams requires the evaluation of the free energy differences between multiple phases of elements , compounds and solid solutions based on a few lattices .",
    "this requirement leads to the problem of assigning definite values of energy to unstable phases of the constituent elements , which is considered to preclude the direct use of lattice stabilities derived for these structures by _ ab - initio _ electronic structure calculations .",
    "attempts to resolve this problem , such as the current calphad practice , are usually based on extrapolations that aim to give a smooth continuation of the gibbs energy through the unstable range of alloy compositions of the investigated system .",
    "the assignment of the extrapolation is highly non - unique and is usually regarded as devoid of physical content but merely provides a convenient description of multi - component alloys .",
    "moreover , its consistency with established experimental data can not be always guaranteed and may lead to errors in the assessment of the phase diagram .    here ,",
    "we examine four binary systems of transition metal alloys , tm - ti systems with tm= mo , nb , ta and v , in which the problem of unstable phases of the elements arises .",
    "we assess the phase diagrams of these systems using two approaches for the lattice stabilities of their respective constituents , one in which they are derived from dft calculations and another where the empirical sgte values are used without further adjustments .",
    "the resulting phase diagrams clearly demonstrate that attempts to mix computational results for the unknown properties of the solid solutions with an empirical assessment of the lattice stabilities of the elements lead to phase diagrams that badly contradict established experimental data . on the other hand , the use of the _ ab - initio _ lattice stability values produces phase diagrams that agree well with the available observations and extends them to temperature regimes where experimental data is lacking . in the four cases we examined ,",
    "it is predicted that the transition from high - temperature solid solutions to low - temperature phase separation is characterized by a complex solvus with a miscibility gap between two bcc phases .",
