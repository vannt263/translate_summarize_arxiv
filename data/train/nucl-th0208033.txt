    "the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) interaction constitutes the basic process in nuclear dynamics and as such it has been for many years the object of extensive study .",
    "different approaches , going from almost completely phenomenological potentials and meson - exchange treatments at the baryon level to quark model descriptions , have been developed to mitigate the current impossibility to directly obtain the form of the interaction from qcd .",
    "each approach has its own justification .",
    "the use of more and more sophisticated phenomenological baryonic potentials allows a very precise fit of some data in a selected energy domain .",
    "meson - exchange approaches at the baryon level make clear the role of effective hadronic degrees of freedom at a given energy scale .",
    "quark model descriptions based on qcd and formulated in terms of effective quark degrees of freedom might be the closest approach to the underlying theory .",
    "from all of them we have been able to reach a quite reasonable , though not complete , understanding of the two - nucleon interaction at low energy ( @xmath4 mev ) @xcite .",
    "when increasing the energy , the opening of channels involving the excitation of baryon resonances determines to a good extent the character of the interaction .",
    "up to 1 gev relative kinetic energy in the laboratory , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the most prominent resonances @xcite .",
    "the role played by the @xmath7 resonance has been studied at the baryon level @xcite as well as at the quark level @xcite , by means of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 potentials .",
    "these studies show the relevance of a quark analysis to properly treat the short - range part of the interaction .",
    "the @xmath11 ( roper ) is a broad resonance which couples strongly ( 60@xmath1270@xmath13 ) to the @xmath14 channel and significantly ( 5@xmath1210@xmath13 ) to the @xmath15 channel @xcite .",
    "these features suggest that the roper resonance should play an important role in nuclear dynamics as an intermediate state .",
    "this role has been analyzed at the baryon level .",
    "graphs involving the excitation of @xmath16 appear in different systems , as for example the neutral pion production in proton - proton reactions @xcite or the three - nucleon interaction mediated by @xmath17 and @xmath18 exchange contributing to the triton binding energy @xcite .",
    "the excitation of the roper resonance has also been used to explain the missing energy spectra in the @xmath19 reaction @xcite or the @xmath20 reaction @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath11 to @xmath14 and @xmath21 channels could also be important in heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies @xcite .",
    "the presence of @xmath22 configurations on the deuteron has been suggested long ago @xcite . finally , pion electro- and photoproduction may take place through the @xmath23 excitation @xcite .",
    "however the use of a @xmath24 transition potential as a straightforward generalization of some pieces of the @xmath25 potential plus the incorporation of resonance width effects may have , as commented above for the @xmath7 , serious shortcomings specially concerning the short - range part of the interaction @xcite .",
    "in view of the current interest in nucleon resonances in a nuclear physics context , it seems appropriate to extend the quark model @xmath3 calculations to treat all presently accepted @xmath26 resonances . in this article",
    "we propose a quark model treatment of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "we shall adopt the same quark model approach previously used for the @xmath27 case and also applied to the @xmath28 interaction @xcite .",
    "we shall center our attention in the derivation of a @xmath29 transition potential from a quark - quark ( @xmath30 ) basic interaction incorporating gluon , pion and sigma exchanges . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we shall follow a born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation with harmonic oscillator baryon wave functions written in terms of quarks .",
    "the roper resonance , @xmath6 , will be considered as a stable particle .",
    "a main feature of our quark treatment is its universality in the sense that all the baryon - baryon interactions are treated on an equal footing .",
    "moreover , once the model parameters are fixed from @xmath3 data there are no free parameters for any other case .",
    "this allows a microscopic understanding and connection of the different baryon - baryon interactions that is beyond the scope of any analysis based only on effective hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is important not only in the short - range regime , where it does not exist a definite prescription for the potentials at the baryon level when resonances are involved , but at all distances . in particular , the asymptotic ( long - range ) behavior of the @xmath31 potential allows the determination of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 coupling constants as well as their ratios to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 coupling constants , respectively .",
    "these studies are instructive inasmuch as they are expected to lead to a deeper understanding of the nuclear potential and entail a rethinking of basic nuclear concepts from the point of view of the fundamental quark substructure .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we write the @xmath30 interaction and analyze the two - baryon wave functions in order to obtain the @xmath0 transition potential . in sec .",
    "iii we draw the results for different partial waves and spin - isospin channels . in sec .",
    "iv we proceed to determine the @xmath1 and @xmath34 coupling constants and relate them to the @xmath32 and @xmath35 coupling constants . finally , in sec .",
    "v we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "in the born - oppenheimer approximation the @xmath36 transition potential at the interbaryon distance @xmath37 is obtained by sandwiching between @xmath3 and @xmath22 states ( expressed in terms of quarks ) the @xmath30 potential for all the pairs formed by two quarks belonging to different baryons . in other words :    @xmath38    where    @xmath39    the quark - quark potential has been very much detailed elsewhere @xcite and it will only be written here for completeness .",
    "it reads ,    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the interquark distance .",
    "@xmath42 is the confining potential , whose detailed radial structure being fundamental to study the hadron spectra is expected to play a minor role for the two - baryon interaction @xcite . to be consistent with baryon and meson spectroscopy",
    "it will be taken to be linear    @xmath43    where the @xmath44 stand for the color su(3 ) matrices .",
    "@xmath45 is the perturbative one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) interaction containing coulomb ( @xmath46 ) , spin - spin ( @xmath47 and tensor terms ( @xmath48 ) @xcite    @xmath49% \\,\\delta ( { \\vec{r}}_{ij})-{\\frac{3}{{4m_{q}^{2}\\,r_{ij}^{3}}}}\\,s_{ij}\\biggr \\rbrace\\,,\\ ] ]    and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the one - pion ( ope ) and one - sigma exchange ( ose ) interactions given by :    @xmath52 { \\vec \\sigma% } _",

    "they are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite where an accurate description of the @xmath3 scattering phase shifts and the deuteron properties is obtained .",
    "they also provide a reasonable description of the baryon spectrum @xcite .",
    "the born - oppenheimer approximation followed integrates out the quark coordinates keeping r fixed .",
    "hence , quantum fluctuations of the two - baryon center - of - mass are neglected . nonetheless , a more complete treatment as the one implied by the use of the resonating group method may not represent , at least for the calculations we perform , major changes as it turns out to be the case for the @xmath3 interaction @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath22 wave functions we shall use hereforth have been also detailed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we only quote some results that will be useful in what follows .",
    "the @xmath57 and @xmath11 states are given in terms of quarks by :    @xmath58(0s)^3\\rangle \\otimes [ 1^{3}]_{c } \\ , , \\label{eq10}\\ ] ]    @xmath59(0s)^2(1s)\\rangle -\\sqrt{% \\frac{1}{3 } } |[3](0s)(0p)^2\\rangle \\right\\ } \\otimes [ 1^{3}]_{c } \\ , , \\label{eq11}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60_{c}$ ] is the completely antisymmetric color state , @xmath61 $ ] is the completely symmetric spin - isospin state and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , stand for harmonic oscillator orbitals .    for a definite orbital angular momentum @xmath65 and spin @xmath66 , the @xmath3 wave function satisfies , due to the identity of the baryons , the selection rule    @xmath67",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath22 system , due to the nonidentity of @xmath57 and @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless antisymmetry at quark level , coming from the identity of quarks , gives rise to a generalized selection rule for any nucleon resonance @xmath26 , that can be written as    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the @xmath70 spin - isospin parity determining the symmetric ( @xmath71 even ) or antisymmetric ( @xmath71 odd ) character of the @xmath72 wave function in the spin - isospin space .",
    "the case @xmath71 even gives rise to the same @xmath70 channels than in the @xmath3 case , whereas the case @xmath71 odd corresponds to channels forbidden in the @xmath3 case that reflects the effects of quark identity beyond baryon identity .",
    "these _ forbidden _ channels play a relevant role in the @xmath73 case @xcite .",
    "however for the @xmath36 transition we are dealing with the situation simplifies considerably .",
    "in fact , as the strong interaction preserves isospin we have @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore the structure of the interaction given by eq . ( [ terms ] ) allows only to connect @xmath3 and @xmath75 channels verifying @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "therefore the initial state selection rule translates to the final state , i.e. only @xmath71 even @xmath78 channels are allowed .    the most representative diagrams contributing to the @xmath79 potential , as calculated from eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) , are drawn in fig .",
    "we distinguish between the direct diagrams ( labeled as @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , not involving quark exchanges , and the rest of diagrams including exchange of quarks ( labeled as @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "most diagrams contributing to the interaction are due to the first term of the @xmath23 wave function ( @xmath82(0s)^2(1s)\\rangle$ ] ) , only a few of them , those with two vertical dashed lines , correspond to the second term of the @xmath83 wave function ( @xmath82(0s)(0p)^2\\rangle$ ] ) .",
    "in figs . [ 1s0de ] , [ 1p1de ] , and [ 1d2de ] , we show the potentials obtained for @xmath84 ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) , and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) partial waves , respectively .",
    "contributions from the different terms of the potential as separated in eq .",
    "( [ terms ] ) have been made explicit .",
    "for some selected partial waves , we separate in fig .",
    "[ 3s1di ] the contribution of the different diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "let us mention that an arbitrary global phase between the @xmath57 and @xmath23 wave functions as written in eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) has to be chosen .",
    "we will discuss all aspects depending on this choice .",
    "there are a number of general features that can be enumerated :    \\(i ) the very long - range part of the interaction ( @xmath93 fm ) comes dominated , as for the @xmath25 and @xmath94 cases , by the one - pion exchange , the longest - range piece of the potential .",
    "however the asymptotic potential reverses sign with respect to both @xmath25 and @xmath95 .",
    "thus for @xmath66 and @xmath96 waves the @xmath0 interaction is asymptotically repulsive .",
    "this sign reversal is a direct consequence of the presence of a node in the @xmath11 wave function what implies a change of sign with respect to the @xmath57 wave function at long distances ( if the opposite sign for the @xmath23 wave function were chosen the very long - range part of the interaction would be attractive but there would also be a change in the character of the short - range part ) .",
    "this is also corroborated by the study of the one - sigma exchange interaction that is always asymptotically repulsive at difference to the @xmath25 and @xmath97 cases ( for @xmath98 there are two compensating changes of sign coming from the two ropers ) .",
    "it is worth to remark that no quark antisymmetrization effects survive either in the numerator or in the denominator ( norm ) of eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) at these distances .",
    "in other words , the potential corresponds to a direct baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "\\(ii ) for the long - range @xmath99 fm part , the one - pion and one - sigma - exchange potentials altogether determine the character of the interaction , since the one - gluon - exchange gives a negligible contribution for @xmath100 fm .",
    "one should also notice that although the contribution from quark exchange diagrams is very much suppressed for @xmath100 fm , some quark antisymmetrization effects may still be present through the norm ( see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "\\(iii ) at intermediate range @xmath101 fm a complex interplay among all pieces of the potential ( gluon , pion and sigma ) generates the final form of the interaction . when decreasing @xmath37 from 2 fm to 0.6 fm two effects take place .",
    "on the one hand , quark exchange diagrams are increasingly important becoming dominant below @xmath102 fm . on the other hand the different pieces of the potential are changing sign : from attractive to repulsive for the gluon in all partial waves , from repulsion to attraction for the sigma in @xmath66 and @xmath96 waves and from repulsion to attraction and",
    "again to repulsion for the pion in @xmath66 and @xmath96 waves . as a combined result of these effects the total potential turns out to be attractive from @xmath102 fm down to a lower value of @xmath37 different for each partial wave .",
    "this behavior , related again to the node in the roper wave function , contrasts with the @xmath25 and @xmath103 cases , where for instance for @xmath66 and @xmath96 waves the scalar ( sigma ) part keeps always the same sign and gives the dominant contribution for @xmath104 fm .",
    "\\(iv ) the choice of @xmath105 fm as a lower limit for the intermediate range comes motivated by the repulsive character of the potential in all partial waves for shorter distances .",
    "the one - gluon and one - pion quark exchange parts are mainly responsible for such a repulsion as it turns out to be the case for @xmath25 and @xmath103 .",
    "nevertheless there are two distinctive features with respect to these cases : in @xmath36 the intensity of the repulsion at @xmath106 and the value of @xmath37 at which the interaction becomes repulsive are significantly lower than in @xmath25 and @xmath107 .",
    "this is a clear effect of the more similarity ( higher overlap ) in these cases between initial and final states what makes the pauli principle more active .",
    "the potential obtained can be also written at all distances in terms of baryonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "one should realize that a @xmath30 spin and isospin independent potential as for instance the scalar one - sigma exchange , gives rise at the baryon level , apart from a spin - isospin independent potential , to a spin - spin , an isospin - isospin and a spin - isospin dependent interaction @xcite . nonetheless for distances",
    "@xmath110 fm , where quark antisymmetrization interbaryon effects vanish , we are only left with the direct part , i.e. with a scalar one - sigma exchange at the baryon level .",
    "the same kind of argument can be applied to the one - pion exchange potential . thus asymptotically ( @xmath110 fm ) ose and ope have at the baryon level the same spin - isospin structure than ose and ope at the quark level .",
    "hence we can parametrize the asymptotic central interactions as ( the @xmath111 depending exponential term is negligible asymptotically as compared to the yukawa term ) @xmath112 \\ , \\frac{e^{-m_{\\pi } r}}{r } \\ , ,   \\label{lrg}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath113    where @xmath114 stands for the coupling constants at the baryon level and @xmath115 is the reduced mass of the @xmath22 system @xmath116 .",
    "one should note that at these distances the use of the bo approximation is justified and the resonating group method potential would give quite the same results .    by comparing these baryonic potentials with the asymptotic behavior of the ope and ose previously obtained from the quark calculation we can extract the @xmath1 and @xmath2 coupling constants . as the parameters at the quark level are fixed once for all from the @xmath3 interaction",
    "our results allow a prediction of these constants in terms of the elementary @xmath117 coupling constant and the one - baryon model dependent structure .",
    "the sign obtained for the meson-@xmath22 coupling constants and for their ratios to the meson-@xmath3 coupling constants is ambiguous since it comes determined by the arbitrarily chosen relative sign between the @xmath57 and @xmath11 wave functions",
    ". only the ratios between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 would be free of this uncertainty .",
    "this is why we will quote absolute values except for these cases where the sign is a clear prediction of the model . to get such a prediction",
    "we can use any partial wave .",
    "we shall use for simplicity the @xmath85 wave , this is why we only wrote the central interaction in eq .",
    "( [ lrg ] ) .",
    "the @xmath118 vertex factor comes from the vertex form factor chosen at momentum space as a square root of monopole @xmath119 , the same choice taken at the quark level , where chiral symmetry requires the same form for pion and sigma .",
    "a different choice for the form factor at the baryon level , regarding its functional form as well as the value of @xmath54 , would give rise to a different vertex factor and eventually to a different functional form for the asymptotic behavior .",
    "for instance , for a modified monopole form , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the meson mass ( @xmath122 or @xmath123 ) , the vertex factor would be @xmath124 , i.e. @xmath125 , keeping the potential the same exponentially decreasing asymptotic form . then it is clear that the extraction from any model of the meson - baryon - baryon coupling constants depends on this choice .",
    "we shall say they depend on the coupling scheme .    for the one - pion exchange and for our value of @xmath126 @xmath127 , @xmath128 , pretty close to @xmath124 . as a consequence , in this case",
    "the use of our form factor or the modified monopole form at baryonic level makes little difference in the determination of the coupling constant .",
    "this fact is used when fixing @xmath129 from the experimental value of @xmath130 extracted from @xmath3 data .",
    "the value we use for @xmath131 corresponds to @xmath132 .",
    "to get @xmath133 we turn to our numerical results for the @xmath85 ope potential , fig . [ nr1s0lrg](a ) , and fit its asymptotic behavior ( in the range @xmath134 fm ) to eq .",
    "( [ lrg ] ) .",
    "we obtain    @xmath135    i.e. @xmath136 .",
    "as explained above only the absolute value of this coupling constant is well defined .",
    "let us note that in ref .",
    "@xcite a different sign with respect to our coupling constant is obtained what is a direct consequence of the different global sign chosen for the @xmath11 wave function . the coupling scheme dependence can be explicitly eliminated if we compare @xmath137 with @xmath138 extracted from the @xmath139 potential within the same quark model approximation , fig .",
    "[ nr1s0lrg](b ) .",
    "thus we get    @xmath140    by proceeding in the same way for the ose potential , i.e. by fitting the potential given in fig .",
    "[ nr1s0silrg](a ) to eq .",
    "( [ slrg ] ) , and following an analogous procedure for the @xmath3 case , fig . [ nr1s0silrg](b ) , we can write    @xmath141    the relative phase chosen for the @xmath23 wave function with respect to the @xmath57 wave function is not experimentally relevant in any two step process comprising @xmath11 production and its subsequent decay .",
    "however it will play a relevant role in those reactions where the same field ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) couples simultaneously to both systems , @xmath3 and @xmath22 . in these cases the interference term between both diagrams would determine the magnitude of the cross section @xcite .",
    "the ratio given in eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) is similar to that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and a factor 1.5 smaller than the one obtained from the analysis of the partial decay width @xcite .",
    "nonetheless one can find in the literature values for @xmath142 ranging between 0.27@xmath120.47 coming from different experimental analyses with uncertainties associated to the fitting of parameters @xcite .    regarding the ratio obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) , our result agrees quite well with the only experimental available result , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the fit of the cross section of the isoscalar roper excitation in @xmath143 in the 10@xmath1215 gev region , where a value of 0.48 is given .",
    "furthermore , we can give a very definitive prediction of the magnitude and sign of the ratio of the two ratios ,    @xmath144    which is an exportable prediction of our model .",
    "for the sake of completeness we give the values of @xmath145 and @xmath146 , though one should realize that the corresponding form factor @xmath147 differs quite much from 1 .",
    "moreover , the quark model dependence is quite strong what can make nonsense any comparison to other values obtained in the literature within a different framework .",
    "we get    @xmath148    i.e. @xmath149 , and    @xmath150    i.e. @xmath151 .    concerning the absolute value of @xmath152 some caveats are in order .",
    "our value is scheme and quark - model dependent and should only be sensibly compared with a value obtained in the same framework . as a matter of fact , if we had extracted the quark model factor dependence from the coupling constant ( @xmath153 ) @xcite the result would have been @xmath1541.14 that compares quite well with the value given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath155 . with respect to the results given in ref .",
    "@xcite they are very sensitive to both the decay width of the sigma meson into two pions and the mass of the sigma as reflected in the large error bars given .",
    "both quantities are highly undetermined in the particle data book @xcite , the mass of the sigma being constrained between 400@xmath121200 mev and the width between 600@xmath121000 mev .",
    "these values have been fixed arbitrarily in ref .",
    "@xcite to @xmath156500 mev and @xmath157250 mev . varying the mass of the sigma between 400 and 700 mev for a fixed width of 250 mev , the coupling constant according to eq .",
    "( 9 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite varies between 0.18@xmath122.54 .",
    "taking a width of 450 mev the resulting coupling is 0.27@xmath121.64 . in both cases ,",
    "our value lies in the interval given above what makes it compatible with the @xmath23 decay and production phenomenology .",
    "let us finally mention that at short distances , the interaction could be fitted in terms of two different yukawa functions , one depending on the meson mass , @xmath121 , the other with a shorter range depending on @xmath158 .",
    "these two yukawa functions could be associated to the two diagrams with different intermediate states ( @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) appearing in time ordered perturbation theory when an effective calculation at the baryonic level is carried out ( let us realize that in a quark calculation the intermediate state is always @xmath161 , the @xmath162 mass difference being taken into account through the @xmath57 and @xmath23 wave functions ) . for practical purposes , as done in previous works @xcite , separable expansions of the quark - based interactions can be performed and used in standard few - body calculations .",
    "starting from a quark - quark chiral symmetric interaction model and assuming simple harmonic wave functions for @xmath57 and @xmath11 in terms of quarks we have derived a transition @xmath0 potential in an adiabatic approach .",
    "the roper resonance has been taken as a stable particle .",
    "our results for @xmath66 , @xmath163 and @xmath96 waves show significant differences concerning the character of the interaction ( attractive or repulsive ) at intermediate and longer distances with respect to the @xmath139 and @xmath95 cases for the chosen @xmath23 overall phase .",
    "this has to do with the presence of a node in the roper wave function . on the contrary",
    "the short - range interaction has the same character in all cases but the intensity gets reduced in the @xmath0 transition as a consequence of the lesser similarity between initial and final states that makes the pauli principle to be less active .",
    "these results show that the usual procedure of obtaining @xmath70 interactions by a simple scaling of the @xmath164 one should be handled with care .",
    "the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the potentials allows to determine the @xmath1 and @xmath2 coupling constants on the same foot than @xmath32 and @xmath35 couplings .",
    "ratios between coupling constants of the type @xmath165 and @xmath166 are obtained .",
    "these ratios , whose sign is ambiguous , are coupling scheme independent and they have a softened quark model dependence ( when compared to the dependence of the value of each constant separately ) .",
    "furthermore the model allows the prediction of not only the magnitude but also the relative sign between the two ratios .    we should finally notice that for dynamical applications our results should be implemented by the inclusion of the @xmath11 width .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the two baryon center - of - mass , neglected here , could also play some role . though these improvements will have a quantitative effect we do not think our predictions will be very much modified at a qualitative level . in this sense they could serve either as a first step for more refined calculations or as a possible guide for phenomenological applications .",
