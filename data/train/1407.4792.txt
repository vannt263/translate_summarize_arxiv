    "the second law of thermodynamics provides an arrow of time as the direction of the increase in entropy .",
    "this implies that the initial entropy of our universe has been small and has led to discussions about the fine - tuning of the universe ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent one ) . in this paper",
    "we try to investigate the issue in the context of the evolution of entropy in the phase space . in section [ sec : cg ] we emphasize the importance of coarse - graining and how it can change the direction of the arrow of time .",
    "we show that the choice of coarse - graining corresponds to the choice of a coordinate grid . then in section [ sec",
    ": dec ] we explain how decoherence can fix this coordinate grid .",
    "then we come back to our original problem and see how the requirement of low initial entropy constrains the process of decoherence .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in [ sec : con ] .",
    "according to the second law of thermodynamics , the entropy of a closed system increases with time .",
    "one way to envision this in classical physics is to consider the phase space atoms has a @xmath0-dimensional phase space , not a 6-dimensional one .",
    "we suppress the index @xmath1 on the canonical variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 . ]",
    "evolution of the system , where the gibbs entropy of a distribution @xmath4 on the phase space is given by @xmath5 however , liouville s theorem guarantees that any evolution governed by the classical equations of motion preserves @xmath6 .. the conservation of @xmath7 in time then follows from the obvious fact that the total number of points @xmath8 in any volume element has to be conserved . ]",
    "[ fig : coarse - graining ] shows such a transition from an initial to a final distribution ( a to b ) with conserved entropy .",
    "the element that turns @xmath6 to an increasing quantity is _ coarse - graining_. to clarify , let us distinguish between two different notions that coarse - graining may refer to .",
    "one is to introduce a few macroscopic variables to describe the system , rather than using all microscopic coordinates .",
    "another notion of coarse - graining , which is the one we use in this paper , is to introduce a degree of blurring and fuzziness on the shape of the evolving distribution , but keep the same number of variables . under this fuzziness ,",
    "gray points that are close in fig .",
    "[ fig : coarse - graining]b but separated by white regions merge to form a larger volume and hence give a larger entropy ( since entropy is equivalent to phase space volume in this example ) .",
    "one way to implement coarse - graining is to employ a coordinate system such that the characteristic size of the coordinate grid corresponds to the resolution scale of coarse - graining : the larger the grid size , the more coarse - grained will be the calculated volume / entropy .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig : coarse - graining]b ( and trivially in [ fig : coarse - graining]a ) : the coarse - grained volume consists of all box - shaped coordinate cells that are fully or partially covered by the gray region .",
    "it is then clear that ordinary and coarse - grained entropy are equal in fig .",
    "[ fig : coarse - graining]a , but coarse - grained entropy is larger than ordinary entropy in fig .",
    "[ fig : coarse - graining]b .",
    "so the second law of thermodynamics holds , if we use the coarse - grained entropy and follow the arrow of time from a to b.    it is important to note how coarse - graining depends on the choice of coordinates . in figs .",
    "[ fig : coarse - graining]c and [ fig : coarse - graining]d the coordinate grid is chosen to suit the ` final ' distribution .",
    "our coordinate cells ( regions bounded by neighboring red ` radial ' and blue ` circular ' curves ) are no longer box - shaped , and hence we have a different coarse - graining . as a result , in fig .",
    "[ fig : coarse - graining]c we have a situation similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : coarse - graining]a , where ordinary and coarse - grained entropy are equal . on the other hand , the coarse - grained entropy in fig .",
    "[ fig : coarse - graining]d is now larger than the ordinary entropy , in view of this new choice of coordinates .",
    "we thus conclude that the direction of the increase in coarse - grained entropy ( thermodynamic arrow of time ) depends on the choice of coordinates used in coarse - graining . in a sense , this is pretty natural .",
    "once a coordinate system is picked , the boundary of our distribution in the phase space can be described by an equation in terms of those coordinates .",
    "the complexity of that equation  and hence of our description  is related to the degree of similarity between the shape of the boundary and the shape of the coordinate grid . in other words ,",
    "what seems very ordered in one coordinate grid ( and requires very few bits to describe ) may turn out to be very complicated in a different grid ( and require many bits of information ) .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that it is always possible to choose a coordinate grid that assigns lower coarse - grained entropy to the initial ( final ) state compared to the final ( initial ) state .",
    "it seems plausible that we can also find a grid which maintains a monotonic relation between coarse - grained entropy and time .",
    "this is a harder task since it involves all times in between the initial and final moment , nevertheless we take it for granted without proof .",
    "as we saw in the preceding section , the choice of coordinates is fundamental in coarse - graining .",
    "so which coordinate system should we choose ?",
    "let us consider the case of a room filled with a gas of atoms , where our intuition can guide us .",
    "the natural choice here is positions @xmath9 and momenta @xmath10 .",
    "if the atoms start out in a corner of the room , they begin to spread to other regions ( both in space and phase space ) but they wo nt occupy the entire phase space , because their phase space volume can not increase .",
    "however , if we choose this natural coordinate grid , then their coarse - grained volume / entropy does increase until a uniform distribution on the entire phase space is reached .",
    "why do we regard @xmath9 and @xmath10 as our natural coordinates ?",
    "the underlying reason is that these are the quantities we can measure and probe the system with . in other words ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are classical variables that correspond to pointer bases @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , which are in turn selected via decoherence @xcite .",
    "of course , we usually measure only a few of these variables or particular combinations of them ( like macroscopic variables such as the center of mass , volume , and pressure of the gas ) , if , for a gas of @xmath13 atoms , we specify only 3 variables , then instead of a grid we will have foliations of the phase space with codimension-3 hypersurfaces blurred at the resolution scale .",
    "a grid is the case of specifying @xmath0 variables , yielding blurred points . ] but we want to see what we get if we measure everything we can  albeit with a given resolution .",
    "one may legitimately employ canonical variables like @xmath14 to study the system ; ) ; and even if they did , @xmath15 would nt be a classical variable selected by decoherence . ] but using @xmath16 for coarse - graining does nt have physical meaning , since our measurements only involve readouts of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "so we are left with @xmath17 as our coarse - graining coordinates .    as our last takeaway from this example",
    ", we note that decoherence does nt take place for all degrees of freedom ; for example , although the positions of atoms become classical but the internal states of their electrons or quarks do not , unless specific measurements are performed to create appropriate interactions with the environment .",
    "we exclude such non - classical variables from the phase space in our classical treatment of the system and incorporate them into the environment .",
    "again it is the decoherence process that determines which degrees of freedom become classical .",
    "in other words , our probing options , i.e. , available pointer bases , are determined by the nature of the environment and its constituent fragments as recorders of information about the system @xcite . for the classical gas",
    "these are , for example , individual particles positions , momenta , energies , and angular momenta , corresponding to pointer bases @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . an important feature of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 bases is that they are eigenvectors of canonical operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( where all @xmath20 s and all @xmath21 s commute among themselves , but @xmath22=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}$ ] ) which generate the algebra of operators .",
    "it seems that there is no other pair of pointer bases for this system that has this feature .",
    "so we take as part of our proposal that the coarse - graining coordinates should correspond to pointer bases which arise from canonical operators .",
    "we can now describe the situation in general . to obtain the appropriate coordinates for coarse - graining",
    ", we go back to the time decoherence was first established and concentrate on those degrees of freedom which have become classical .",
    "this provides a set of pointer bases , which we assume to come in the form of eigenvectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 of canonical operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we then choose @xmath17 as our desired coordinates on phase space and compute the corresponding classical distribution from the quantum state of the system .",
    "for example , for a density matrix @xmath23 , we can use the wigner distribution becomes positive @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath24 at this stage , we compute the entropy of @xmath4 coarse - grained in the @xmath17 grid . for systems we observe this should be a small number , compared to the late time coarse - grained entropy , since we see the entropy increase in our world .",
    "if the distribution @xmath4 fits in the grid @xmath17 with few or no partially covered cells , then we have a situation with low initial entropy .",
    "this seems to be the case for our universe , since it s apparently begun with little entropy .",
    "a generic distribution @xmath4 has wild behavior and is unlikely to be organized within the grid .",
    "thus the requirement of low initial entropy imposes constraints on the decoherence process through restrictions on the pointer bases it yields .",
    "there are three elements in this process that may be constrained .",
    "the first one is the quantum state @xmath23 before decoherence .",
    "the second one is the system / environment splitting , especially since at times we incorporate into the environment some of the degrees of freedom that may appear to belong to the system ( like the electron / quark states in the gas example above ) .",
    "this is also the case if we want to study the initial entropy of the universe as a closed system , in which case a large number of degrees of freedom are included in the system but also a large number of them are reserved as environment ( otherwise , we can not think of this closed universe as a classical system ) .",
    "finally , the form of the hamiltonian that describes the interaction between the system ( or parts of it that we study ) and the environment ( and/or the rest of the system ) is affected by these constraints . in this context , therefore , the search for the reason behind the low entropy of the early universe is to be accompanied by investigations of the decoherence process .",
    "we noticed the significance of coarse - graining in the definition of the entropy as it appears in the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "we also pointed out the importance of the choice of the coordinate grid in coarse - graining , noting that the direction of increase in the coarse - grained entropy can be flipped at will by changing the grid .",
    "then we argued that decoherence is the underlying element the determines the grid and hence the arrow of time .",
    "finally , we explained how this leads to constraints on the decoherence process if we want to have a low initial entropy .",
    "* note added .",
    "* at the time of completion of this work , an independent paper by rovelli with similar ideas appeared on arxiv @xcite .",
    "while some of the basic ideas are shared in our works , there are differences as well . the notion of coarse - graining employed in ref .",
    "@xcite is different from the one used here .",
    "it is related to coarse - graining with fixing macroscopic variables , as discussed in the first paragraph of section [ sec : cg ] here",
    ". then the macroscopic observables that are to be used for coarse - graining are picked by interactions among subsystems .",
    "thus in ref .",
    "@xcite , interactions play the role that decoherence plays here . as we discussed at the end of section [ sec : dec ] , decoherence plays this role through interactions as well as system / environment splitting and the quantum state .",
    "so there is quite a similarity here .",
