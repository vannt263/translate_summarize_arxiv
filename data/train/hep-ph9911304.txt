    "apart from the low - energy regime of the strong interaction , flavour physics is the least tested part of the sm .",
    "this is reflected in the rather large error bars of several flavour parameters such as the mixing parameters at the twenty percent level @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental situation concerning @xmath0 physics will drastically change in the near future .",
    "there are several @xmath0 physics experiments successfully running at the moment . in the upcoming years",
    "new facilities will start to explore @xmath0 physics with increasing sensitivity and within different experimental settings @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 quark system is an ideal laboratory for studying flavour physics .",
    "hadrons containing a @xmath1 quark are the heaviest hadrons experimentally accessible .",
    "since the mass of the @xmath1 quark is much larger than the qcd scale , the long - range strong interactions are expected to be comparably small and are well under control thanks to the heavy quark expansion  @xcite .    of particular interest",
    "are the so - called rare @xmath0 decays , which are flavour changing neutral current processes ( fcnc ) which vanish at the tree level of the sm .",
    "thus , they are rather sensitive probes for physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "one of the main difficulties in analysing rare @xmath0 decays is the calculation of short - distance qcd effects .",
    "these radiative corrections lead to a tremendous rate enhancement .",
    "the qcd radiative corrections bring in large logarithms of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the top quark or the w mass and @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) .",
    "they have to get resummed at least to leading - log ( ll ) precision ( @xmath6 ) .    within the sm the accuracy in the domina- ting perturbative contribution to @xmath7",
    "was recently improved to nll precision .",
    "this was a joint effort of many different groups @xcite .",
    "the theoretical error of the previous leading - log ( ll ) result was substantially reduced to @xmath8 and the central value of the partonic decay rate increased by about @xmath9 .",
    "supersymmetric extensions of the sm have become the most popular framework of new theoretical structures at higher scales , much below the planck scale .",
    "the precise mechanism of the necessary supersymmetry breaking is unknown @xcite .",
    "a reasonable approach to this problem is the inclusion of the most general soft breaking term consistent with the sm gauge symmetries in the so - called unconstrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "this leads to a proli- feration of free parameters in the theory .",
    "a global fit to electroweak precision measurements within supersymmetric models shows that if the superpartner spectrum becomes light the fit to the data results in typically larger values of @xmath10 compared with the sm .",
    "supersymmetric , however , can always avoid serious constraints from data because the supersymmetric contributions decouple @xcite .    in the mssm",
    "there are two kinds of new contributions to fcnc processes .",
    "the first class results from flavour mixing in the sfermion mass matrices @xcite .",
    "moreover , one has ckm - induced contributions from charged higgs boson and chargino exchanges ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the well - known supersymmetric flavour problem : the severe experimental constraints on flavour violations have no direct explanation in the structure of the unconstrained mssm .",
    "clearly , the origin of flavour violation is a model - dependent issue and is based on the relation of the dynamics of flavour and the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking . keeping in mind our current phenomenological knowledge about supersymmetry , it is suggestive to perform a model - independent analysis of flavour changing phenomena .",
    "such an analysis provides important hints on the more fundamental theory of soft supersymmetry breaking .",
    "among inclusive rare @xmath0 decays , the @xmath7 mode is the most prominent because it is the only decay mode in this class that is already measured @xcite .",
    "many papers are devoted to studying the @xmath7 decay and similar decays within the mssm . however , in most of these analyses , the contributions of supersymmetry were not investigated with the systematics of the sm calculations . in @xcite",
    "it was shown , that in a specific supersymmetric scenario nll contributions are important and lead to a significant reduction of the stop - chargino mass region where the supersymmetric contribution has a large destructive interference with the charged - higgs boson contribution .",
    "it is expected that the complete nll calculation drastically decreases the scale dependence and , thus , the error .",
    "the nll analysis is also a necessary check of the validity of the perturbative ansatz ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the nll calculations in @xcite and also in @xcite are worked out in the heavy gluino case . in the analysis @xcite reported here ,",
    "the gluino - mediated decay @xmath7 is discussed where the gluino is not assumed to be decoupled .",
    "previous work on the gluino contribution @xcite did not include ll or nll qcd corrections , and gluino exchanges were treated in the so - called mass insertion approximation ( mia ) only , where the off - diagonal squark mass matrix elements are taken to be small and their higher powers neglected . in our analysis",
    "we explore the limits of the mia . furthermore , we analyse the sensitivity of the bounds on the sfermion mass matrices to radiative qcd corrections .    within the sm ,",
    "there is one coupling constant , @xmath11 , relevant to the @xmath12 decay .",
    "there is also one flavour violation parameter only , namely the product of two ckm matrices .",
    "all the loops the logarithms are due to gluons , which imply a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "the corrections can then be classified according to :    * ( ll ) , @xmath14 , * ( nll ) , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the above ordering also reflects the actual size of the contributions to @xmath12",
    ".    the corresponding analysis of qcd corrections in the mssm is much more complicated .",
    "the mssm has several couplings relevant to this decay and there are several flavour changing parameters .",
    "thus , a formal ll term might have a small coupling while a nll contribution is multiplied with a large one .",
    "moreover , the couplings generally depend on the parameters , and the results should be applicable for large domains on the parameters .",
    "another complication in supersymmetric theo- ries is the occurrence of flavour violations such as gluino exchanges ( through the gluino - quark - squark coupling ) where additional factors @xmath13 are induced .",
    "they lead to magnetic penguin operators where the wilson coefficients naturally contain factors of @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , these contributions induce magnetic operators where the ( small ) factor @xmath16 is replaced by the gluino mass .",
    "clearly this contribution is expected to be dominating .",
    "the gluino - induced contributions to the decay amplitude for @xmath17 are of the following form :    * ( ll ) , @xmath18 * ( nll ) , @xmath19    in the matching calculation , all factors @xmath13 regardless of their source should get expressed in terms of the @xmath13 running with five flavours .",
    "however , non - decoupling effects through violations of the supersymmetric equivalence between gauge bosons and corresponding gaugino couplings have to be taken into account at the nll level .",
    "furthermore , one finds that gluino - squark boxes induce new scalar and tensorial four - fermi operators , which are shown to mix into the magnetic operators without gluons . on the other hand , the vectorial four - fermi operators mix only with an additional gluon into magnetic ones .",
    "thus , they will contribute at the next - to - leading order only . however , from the numerical point of view the contributions of the vectorial operators ( although nll ) are not necessarily suppressed w.r.t the new four - fermi contributions ; this is due to the expectation that the flavour - violation parameters present in the wilson coefficients of the new operators are expected to be much smaller ( or much more stringently constrained ) than the corresponding ones in the coefficients of the vectorial operators .",
    "this is one of the most important reasons why a complete nll order calculation should be performed .",
    "the mixed graphs , containing a @xmath20 , a gluino and a squark , are proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "they give rise only to corrections of the sm operators at the nll level .",
    "there are also penguin contributions with two gluino lines in the nll matching .",
    "the current discussion is restricted to the @xmath20 or gluino - mediated flavour changes and does not consider contributions with other susy particles such as chargino , charged higgs or neutralino . clearly",
    ", analogous phenomena occur in those contributions .",
    "to understand the sources of flavour violation that may be present in supersymmetric models in addition to those enclosed in the ckm matrix , one has to consider the contributions to the mass matrix of a squark of flavour @xmath22 : @xmath23 @xmath24    in the super ckm basis where the quark mass matrix is diagonal and the squarks are rotated in parallel to their superpartners , the @xmath25 terms from the superpotential and the @xmath26 terms in the @xmath27 mass matrices @xmath28 turn out to be diagonal @xmath29 submatrices .",
    "this is in general not true for the additional terms ( [ squarku ] ) from the soft supersymmetry breaking potential . because all neutral gaugino couplings are flavour diagonal in the super ckm basis , the gluino contributions to the decay width of @xmath17 are induced by the off - diagonal elements of the soft terms @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we show a few features of our numerical results based on a complete ll calculation .",
    "more details of the analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the size of the gluino contribution crucially depends on the soft terms in the squark mass matrix @xmath33 and to a lesser extent on those in @xmath34 . in the following ,",
    "we take all the diagonal entries in the soft matrices @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , to be equal ; their common mass is denoted by @xmath38 and set to the value @xmath39 gev .",
    "first , the matrix element @xmath40 is varied .",
    "all other entries in the soft mass terms are put to zero . following the notation of @xcite ,",
    "we define @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the gluino mass .                in fig .",
    "[ sizeqcd23ll ] , the qcd - corrected branching ratio is shown as a function of @xmath43 ( solid lines ) , obtained when only @xmath44 is vanishing ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "shown is also the range of variation of the branching ratio , delimited by dotted lines , obtained when the low - energy scale @xmath46 spans the interval @xmath47@xmath48gev .",
    "the matching scale @xmath49 is here fixed to @xmath50 . as can be seen , the theoretical estimate of @xmath51 is still largely uncertain ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "an extraction of bounds on the @xmath53 quantities more precise than just an order of magnitude , therefore , would require the inclusion of next - to - leading logarithmic qcd corrections .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that the inclusion of the ll qcd corrections has already removed the large ambiguity on the value to be assigned to the factor @xmath54 in the gluino - induced operators . before adding qcd corrections , it is not clear whether the explicit @xmath13 factor should be taken at some high scale @xmath49 or a some low scale @xmath46 , the difference is a ll effect .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath51 for the two extreme choices of @xmath55 are indicated in fig .",
    "[ sizeqcd23ll ] by the dot - dashed lines ( @xmath56 ) and the dashed lines ( @xmath57gev ) .",
    "the branching ratio is then virtually unknown .    in spite of the large uncertainties which the branching ratio @xmath51 still has at the ll in qcd , it is possible to extract indications on the size that the @xmath53-quantities may maximum acquire without inducing conflicts with the experimental measurements . as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the element @xmath44 is certainly the flavour - violating parameter most efficiently constrained . in fig .",
    "[ glsm23ll ] , the dependence of @xmath51 is shown as a function of this parameter when this is the only flavour - violating source . the branching ratio is obtained by adding the sm and the gluino contribution obtained for different choices of @xmath43 for the fixed values @xmath58gev and @xmath59 .",
    "the gluino contribution interferes constructively with the sm for negative values of @xmath44 , which are then more sharply constrained than the positive values .",
    "overall , this parameter can not exceed the per cent level .",
    "much weaker is the dependence on @xmath60 if this is the only off - diagonal element in the down squark mass matrix .",
    "this dependence is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ glsm23ll ] for different choices of @xmath43 .",
    "the induced gluino contribution interferes constructively with the sm contribution for positive @xmath60 .",
    "notice that given the large values of @xmath60 allowed by the experimental measurement , the mia can not be used in this case to obtain a reliable estimate of @xmath51 , whereas it is an excellent of the complete calculation in the case of @xmath44 . in the upper frame of fig .",
    "[ massins_ll03 ] , we vary @xmath61 for @xmath62 . the mia and the exact result start to deviate considerably for @xmath63 ,",
    "i.e. well within the experimental error band ; the exact result leads to more stringent bounds .",
    "an even more drastic example is shown in the lower frame of fig .",
    "[ massins_ll03 ] , where we increase @xmath42 in such a way that @xmath64 , leaving all the other parameters unchanged : for @xmath65 the mass matrix @xmath33 has at least one negative eigenvalue .",
    "this feature is of course completely missed in the mia .",
    "one also has to consider interference effects . in fig .",
    "[ ll23lr33lr23 ] we show that the additional contribution through a chain @xmath66 weakens the bound on the parameter @xmath67 significantly . in the solid curve we put @xmath68 , while in the dashed curve @xmath69 .",
    "we have chosen again @xmath62 .",
