    "one way to infer the existence of objects orbiting a star is by the use of the stellar radial velocity ( rv ) measurements obtained through the observation of the doppler shift in the star s spectrum .",
    "it can be shown ( windmiller 2006 ) that in a @xmath0-body gravitational system in which the centre of mass ( cm ) does not accelerate , the secondary centre of mass of @xmath1 bodies tends to move with a momentum in the opposite direction to that of the other body , thus resulting in a reflex motion that has a component along the observer s line of sight .",
    "it is therefore possible to construct a model in which the stellar motion in the radial direction is calculated based on the gravitational dynamical interaction of the bodies in such a system .",
    "numerous stars have been surveyed to date by different observing groups ( ucles keck / lick , harps / coralie , the aaps ... ) using high resolution velocity measurements of each star with planetary bodies either determined or conjectured .",
    "the method of analysis of these radial velocity data has been outlined in several papers over the years ( laughlin 2001 , rivera 2005 , pepe 2006 ) and has slowly evolved with the essential features remaining unchanged .",
    "the first step in the analysis is the determination of keplerian orbital parameters under the assumption of no mutual gravitational perturbations between the planets , eliminating any significant periodicities in the residual .",
    "once the number of conjectured planets - each with its own keplerian parameters - has been determined , additional assumptions such as co - planarity , edge - on orbits , or resonance , are used to arrive at a full set of newtonian initial conditions .",
    "this orbital configuration is then used as the initial guess for a quasi - newton s method search ( usually the levenberg - marquardt algorithm ) .",
    "the restriction of no mutual planetary gravitational interaction is lifted , and the search proceeds to a self consistent local minimum in the parameter - space vicinity of the keplerian orbital fit . using this family of methods , only a local minimum close to the keplerian parameters under the specific restrictions will be found .    the alternative model proposed here for the prediction of stellar rv data relies on a direct integration of the newtonian equations of motion for a three - body gravitational interaction .",
    "the developed rv reduction algorithm constituting this model encorporates the assumption that in general , there will be significant mutual gravitational planetary perturbation , since it is exactly the star s reflex action to the planetary presence that is being measured . searching the full set of possible initial conditions while directly integrating allows for the investigation of all orbital pathologies unconstrained by any factors ( such as co - planarity , resonance , etc . ) .",
    "each solution , which is the set of initial conditions for the single integration of three - body trajectories and velocities is put in the form of a 12__-tuple _ _ of orbital parameters .",
    "once the full newtonian trajectories are calculated , an algorithm based on the singular value decomposition finds the optimal orientation based on the rv data set . in order to find a solution which predicts a rv curve that sufficiently matches the observations , an optimization process based on methods from the literature has been devised",
    "the search for the absolute minimum of the @xmath2 is implemented first with a genetic algorithm , then with a local search method , typically a compass or a quasi - newton s method .",
    "the entire process of analyzing and predicting the rv data , is referred to here as the planetary orbit fitting process ( pofp ) .",
    "all of the algorithms described here are written in matlab , utilizing its versatility as a mathematical computer language , and a working platform with a graphical interface and powerful application packages .",
    "these include diverse tools such as the suite designed to integrate and manipulate ordinary differential equations ( ode ) . because the pofp in its entirety was not previously described in the literature , a comprehnsive description is included here , complimented by the appendices for more detail .",
    "the three - body * solver * at the centre of the pofp is described in @xmath3 .",
    "the application of the * solver * to produce a predicted stellar rv time series via the orbital - observational parameters is described in @xmath4 . a brief description of the optimization scheme follow in @xmath5",
    ". considerations involving the comparison between predicted and observed quantities are discussed in @xmath5 as well . the keplerian model which is the basis of the methods currently used throughout the literature , orbital stability considerations and the connection between the two",
    "are discussed in @xmath6 .",
    "applications of the pofp using the published radial velocity data for the hd160691 and hd141929 systems are demonstrated in @xmath7 and other cases are discussed in future papers .",
    "the gravitational interaction between @xmath8 bodies due to newton s second law and the universal law of gravitation is given by the system of equations @xmath9 _ { i \\neq j } , i , j = 1 \\rightarrow n\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the mass of particle @xmath11 applying force on particle @xmath12 from a relative position @xmath13 . in the case of three bodies in three dimensions ,",
    "@xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the displacement vector of particle @xmath12 . assuming the cm of the system moves with constant velocity , one of the vectors in system ( 1 ) can be expressed in terms of the other two : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the acceleration vector in the cm frame .",
    "the system ( 1 ) then consists of six second order , or twelve first order differential equations of motion .",
    "the initial conditions for this system are the three masses and their initial position and velocity vectors .",
    "it is then integrated for the trajectories @xmath18 , and velocities @xmath19 utilizing the matlab ode suite .",
    "the algorithms chosen from the suite were ode113 ( variable order adams - bashforth - moulton ) and ode 45 ( runge - kutta - fehlberg , dormand - prince pair ) .",
    "the time span for integration , the relative and the absolute tolerance were specified along with the initial conditions . as part of this scheme",
    ", interpolation can be made over the integrated interval to any desired step size allowing for no further integration .",
    "the * solver * has been tested on problems with known solutions to make sure of its proper use . with the integration of every orbit",
    ", the angular momentum is calculated for each time step and the relative error in it throughout the entire integration time is computed to show conservation . using the constants defined to great accuracy by the iau , and data tabulated in nautical almanac office ( 2006 ) , the trajectories of the earth - moon barycentre , the earth - and - moon and the earth - and - jupiter systems around the sun were computed .",
    "the orbits were shown to close ( in distance and time ) to a sufficient accuracy compared with that of the initial data ( windmiller 2006 ) .",
    "all orbits showed the conservation of angular momentum to the number of digits defined by the error - tolerance .",
    "the trajectories calculated by the * solver * have no specific orientation towards an observer .",
    "to define the direction of the observer s line of sight , the * solver s * coordinate system must be rotated ( see appendices b , c ) .",
    "the application of the three - body solutions ( trajectories and velocities as a function of time ) produced by the * solver * to the problem of fitting an observed stellar rv variation , is made through the assumption that two of the masses ( planets ) are orbiting the third ( star ) .",
    "the search of the full set of initial conditions for the newtonian equations of motion must bring into account the fact that any random set of such conditions most likely leads to unbound trajectories . to resolve this problem",
    ", the set of feasible initial conditions can be parametrized by the set of instantaneous keplerian parameters at the time of the initial data point .",
    "masses , eccentricities and angular information as to relative positions of the orbits and their periastra are used for this parametrization .",
    "the result is a set of orbital parameters from which the initial conditions for the orbiting masses in their two graviataionally bound trajectories are calculated .    in the plane of each orbit ,",
    "the initial position and velocity vectors are defined with respect to the point of periastron , using the eccentricity , e , and a ` @xmath20 ' angle , @xmath21 , measured from the semi - major axis ( see appendices a , e ) .",
    "given the relative positions of the two semi - major axes and the relative tilt between the orbital planes , the initial positions and velocities of one orbit can be transformed into the coordinate system of the other so that all quantities are defined in the same system .",
    "this transformation is achieved by a multiplication of three rotation matrices in which the angles are defined by the relative coordinates of the semi major axes ( see appendix a ) .",
    "these nine orbital parameters allow for any possible geometry of the two planets orbiting the star at the epoch of initial conditions .",
    "the observer s coordinate system is defined as one where the @xmath22 plane is the plane of the sky and the @xmath23 is the radial direction .",
    "the orientation of the * solver s * coordinate system to the observer s line of sight can be defined using two angles .",
    "one of the orbits is chosen and its inclination , @xmath12 , and longitude of periastron , @xmath24 are used to transform the coordinate system of the * solver * into that of the observer .",
    "this transformation is also the product of two rotation matrices ( hilditch 2001 ) .",
    "the orbital parameters that are therefore sufficient to define the initial conditions to the * solver * for the planetary model are the eccentricities @xmath25 , the delay angles @xmath26 , the length of the first semi - major axis @xmath27 and the coordinates of the second semi - major axis @xmath28 , the relative orbital tilt angle @xmath29 , and the three masses @xmath30 .",
    "the observational parameters required are the inclination @xmath12 and the longitude of periastron @xmath24 .",
    "parameter - space for any @xmath0-tuple of initial conditions satisfying the three - body requirements of the * solver * has fifteen dimensions .",
    "this 14-tuple of planetary - model parameters thus reduces by one the number of dimensions in which the search for initial conditions must take place .",
    "the number of dimensions can be reduced further to include the 12 orbital parameters only . for any orbital configuration defined by the parametric 12-tuple , the observer s position ( i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath24 ) from which the * solver*-frame stellar velocity best describes the rv data can be calculated .",
    "the calculation is based on optimizing a least square solution for a unit ` look vector ' , defined by the two angles , which points from the cm of the stellar system to the observer .",
    "the matrix equation is solved using the singular value decomposition ( utilizing matlab s _ svd _ function ) applied on the star s velocity in the * solver * frame ( see appendix c ) .",
    "to find the parameter - point ( 14-tuple or 12-tuple ) for which the comparison between the model - predicted and the observational data results in the absolute minimum @xmath2 , an optimization process was carried out in two steps .",
    "the first step is the implementation of the genetic algorithm ( ga ) as a global search for the region in parameter space where the lowest @xmath2 lies .",
    "the second step of refining the search to the exact parameter - space location of the absolute minimum in the @xmath2 was carried out in various ways . of the derivative - based methods ,",
    "the linear slope and the quadratic slope methods were found to be the least efficient .",
    "this is because of the rapid change in the fitness function s slope and numerical - derivative noise problems ( windmiller 2006 ) .",
    "the hybrid newton - line search method was typically used to advance the search quickly where other methods were unsatisfactory .",
    "the second - step method most frequently used was the compass search .",
    "all algorithms were constructed as independent matlab programs .",
    "the programming of the ga followed several discussions in the literature@xmath31cs/1995 - 564 - 16/pdf ] .",
    "the compass was based on kolda , lewis & torczon ( 2003 ) .",
    "all methods used , most specifically the ga and compass , were tested against known analytical functions before their use in the pofp .    to produce the predicted radial velocity data ,",
    "the pofp implements two translation processes .",
    "first , the @xmath0-tuple of parameters is translated into initial conditions for the * solver*. the information about the dynamical properties of the system ( in the form of the solution produced by the * solver * ) then undergoes a translation into the observer s plane of the sky coordinate system .",
    "an @xmath0-tuple of parameters therefore constitutes a single hypothesis that a specific configuration of initial conditions results in a model that is compatible with the observations .",
    "the quantification of this level of compatibility is made via a fitness function .",
    "the specific fitness function used by the pofp is the @xmath2 ( chi - squared ) .",
    "the derivation and treatment of the @xmath2 function follows that of bevington & robinson ( 2003 ) and press et al .",
    "the assumption that the cm of the stellar system does not accelerate allows for a constant offset velocity to be incorporated into the @xmath2 function ( such a fitness function is presented in go@xmath32dziewski & maciejewski ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "the optimal offset velocity is calculated in closed form within each evaluation of the @xmath2 ( appendix d ) .",
    "because of technical considerations and as the standard used in the literature , the form of the fitness function that is used in practice is the reduced chi squared , @xmath33 , ( with @xmath34 being the number of data points minus the number of parameters , or degrees of freedom , plus 1 ) .",
    "the expected value of @xmath33 is @xmath35 .",
    "however , because this exact value typically is not achieved , a range of values must be considered .",
    "one approach in the interpretation of the pofp solutions @xmath33 is based on using the @xmath36 test as suggested in press et al .",
    "given @xmath37 and @xmath38 it is not possible to reject the assumption that both represent the same data set if both reside inside the same interval .",
    "this interval is determined as a confidence measured by a probability which is given by the appropriate integral - test probability table . for a desired probability of not exceeding the ratio @xmath39 ( typically a probability measuring the confidence of one standard deviation ) ,",
    "the ratio can be calculated , considering the numbers of degrees of freedom @xmath40 .",
    "press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) provides the expression for calculating the ratios as a function of the probabilities .",
    "this interpretation allows for both a comparison between any two values of @xmath33 ( provided @xmath34 is similar in both and sufficiently large ) and a determination of the range of values in which solutions are acceptable relative to one another .    when considering the acceptability of a given solution produced by the pofp , the @xmath33",
    "is treated as the primary criterion .",
    "the secondary measure for how well the fit describes the observations is the root mean square ( rms ) of the error , along with the distribution of the residual velocities which is expected to be a gaussian centred at zero . in the framework of the pofp , a useful rms - related quantity is @xmath41 . here , @xmath42 is the standard deviation in the residual velocities ( comparable to the @xmath43 in the literature ) and @xmath44 is an uncertainty added to the observed velocities due to a variety of factors largely unknown and , in part , related to stellar chromospheric activity ( wright 2005 ) .",
    "the latter is termed here jitter . apart from considering its magnitude ,",
    "the quantities @xmath43 and @xmath45 can be compared to the uncertainty in the observed data .",
    "the quantification of the fit by the @xmath33 and the rms may yet be insufficient for determining how well the model describes the observed phenomenon .",
    "one of the most important considerations that typically applies is that of stability . as the investigation using the pofp of the 47uma system ( described in paper ii ) , as well as that of hd160691 show , solutions that have a low @xmath33 may also ascribe a large eccentricity to one of the planets , resulting in instability .",
    "dynamical stability of the system , therefore , must be considered as a tertiary criterion for accepting the fit .",
    "the application of the pofp is demonstrated in @xmath7 on the star systems hd160691 and hd141929 which have previously been investigated in the literature . in order",
    "to reproduce published results that are based on a keplerian model , a similar scheme has been developed as part of the pofp programming .",
    "separate from the planetary model described earlier , this keplerian constants ( kc ) model allows for a confirmation or an evaluation of the published keplerian results and a comparison between those and the ones produced by the pofp .",
    "the classical keplerian model that has been programmed here is termed the kc model .",
    "it is based on the equations derived for binary mechanics as found in any standard textbook ( e.g. hilditch 2001 ) in relation to the general analytic two - body solution and is comparable to that commonly used in the literature . in this model ,",
    "the motion of a mass in an elliptical orbit around a second mass ( here a planet around a star ) as a function of time is described by kepler s equation . using the period , @xmath46 , and the periastron passage time , @xmath47",
    ", this equation relates the mean anomaly @xmath48 of the orbiting mass to its eccentric anomaly , @xmath49 , and the eccentricity of orbit , @xmath50 : @xmath51 the program iterates ( using the newton raphson method ) for the eccentric anomaly . the true anomaly ( delay angle ) ,",
    "@xmath21 , is calculated as a function of time : @xmath52}\\ ] ] using the half amplitude of the observed velocity , @xmath53 , and the longitude of periastron of orbit , @xmath24 , the radial velocity can be predicted : @xmath54\\ ] ] the predicted radial velocity is calculated separately , using equation ( 5 ) , for the influence of each planet on the star .",
    "these contributions to @xmath55 are then superimposed to give the total predicted radial velocity .",
    "the planets are therefore assumed to have no interaction , making the keplerian quantities constant in time .",
    "a parameter - point constituting a solution in this model is the @xmath0-tuple of kc @xmath56 with @xmath11 designating the planet ( i.e. the 5-tuple @xmath57 for a single keplerian , the 10-tuple @xmath58 for a double keplerian , etc . ) .",
    "the appropriate parameter - point which minimizes the @xmath59 can be searched for using the optimization scheme described in @xmath5 . as with the pofp , the ga is typically used as a first step , followed by the compass method . when optimizing , the kc model is highly sensitive to the initial guess ( or initial population ) .",
    "pofp integration over a sufficiently long time span ( typically much longer than that of the period of the outer planet ) can expose a system as being dynamically unstable or prone to instability .",
    "this is done directly by showing an ejection of one of the bodies from the system , or at the very least a strong gravitational influence of the two planets on one another , making noticeable changes to their trajectories . because the kc model assumes no gravitational interaction outside that between the star and each planet , a separate analysis for stability is required where other factors , not inherent to the model , are brought into account .",
    "an example of a discussion involving this type of analysis can be found in go@xmath32dziewski & maciejewski ( 2003 ) .",
    "using the * solver * to compute the trajectories makes for a direct integration of the newtonian equations of motion which is general in its underlying assumptions , and geometry . because of that , a translation of the initial conditions of the kc model into those of the pofp , followed by integration based on the latter , may be useful in approaching the problem of orbital stability .",
    "the kc parameter point @xmath56 used by the model to express the orbital properties of the @xmath60 planet as they appear to an observer through the plane of the sky ( i.e. in the form of stellar rv data ) , describes a family of newtonian solutions , each being an orbit initiated by a different set of position and velocity vectors .",
    "these solutions differ from one another by two parameters .",
    "the first is the planetary mass traveling in each orbit which can alternatively be expressed by the inclination of that orbit ( using @xmath61 and the mass of the star ) .",
    "for any two orbits , the second quantity is the difference in their position angle of the nodal point , ( usually designated by @xmath62 ) .",
    "therefore , the newtonian fit for any keplerian solution can be described by the @xmath33 calculated as a function of the masses or inclinations of the planets and their differences in position angles . because the pofp s primary use is in solving for three - body trajectories ,",
    "a rigorous analysis of the special case of two planets lends itself as a first step in understanding the relationship between the different models .",
    "given the stellar mass , a 10-tuple of double keplerian parameters ( i.e. 10 kc ) can be translated into the pofp 12-tuple of parameters , excluding the planetary masses .",
    "the @xmath33 for such a solution can then be calculated for triplets of @xmath63 , i.e. for pairs of masses @xmath64 and their orbits relative positions in the plane of the sky . as a preliminary analysis of this three dimensional parameter space",
    ", a crude optimization can be made where the @xmath65 that minimizes the @xmath33 for each pair of masses is chosen .",
    "the resulting surface , @xmath66 can then be examined . for the entire span in inclination",
    ", the domain of this surface shows the allowable range of masses the particular keplerian solution can have .",
    "the regions of lower @xmath33 may easily be located on this surface , and the stability of solutions represented by specific points in them can be investigated .",
    "the principal idea of such an analysis through a translation is shown here in @xmath7 for the double keplerian as it applies to the test case of hd160691 .",
    "some detail of the translation is given in appendix e. a more rigorous stability analysis based on these methods will be discussed in a paper to follow .",
    "one qualitative argument regarding interaction in a stellar - planetary system is the following : if a gravitational influence of the outer planet on the star exists ( one that is sufficiently strong to be detected ) then such an influence of the outer planet on the inner planet must also occur , causing the planets to interact , provided that the two are on the same side of the star .",
    "concretely , in order to assess whether the trajectory calculated from a set of initial conditions results in an ejection of one of the bodies , or more generally , is prone to instability , the * solver * can be used to integrate the orbit on a sufficiently large time span .",
    "such an evaluation , based on the graphical representation of the trajectories , was carried out for all of the pofp solutions in table 1 and table 2 discussed in @xmath7 .",
    "the typical time span used was on the order of hundreds of times the larger period of the two planets .",
    "the assessment , using this method , of a possible instability of an orbital configuration requires a large degree of intuition on the one hand , and is limited by computational resources on the other hand . because of that , the hill stability condition was applied as a complementary criterion , following gladman ( 1993 ) . in his paper , gladman ( 1993 ) distinguishes the hill stability , where the bodies are forbidden from undergoing close approach for all time , from the stronger lagrange stability where , in addition , the semi - major axes are bounded .",
    "the author defines closest approach , which is regarded by him as instability , as being inside the sphere of influence of the outer planet where `` ... it is better to view the motion as one planet around the other being perturbed by the ` sun ' rather than the planets moving around the sun and being perturbed by each other '' ( gladman 1993 ) .",
    "the cutoff for this closest approach is defined numerically by the author in terms of the planetary mass ratio . as is the case in gladman ( 1993 ) , the approach taken here for establishing the hill instability relies on the parametrization of the three - body dynamics by marchal & bozis ( 1982 ) in terms of the three masses , the gravitational constant , the angular momentum and the total energy of the system . for the case",
    "where two of the bodies are much smaller in mass than the third one , the critical value of this parametric expression , indicating a bifurcation of the system s dynamics , is computed by marchal & bozis ( 1982 ) in terms of the masses alone .",
    "the difference between the hill number of a particular solution ( i.e. the dynamical parameter of that orbital configuration ) and the hill critical value is referred to here as the hill difference .",
    "when the hill difference is positive , the planets are forbidden from having a disruptive close approach , which means the system is hill stable ( although ejection of the outer planet may still occur ) . fulfilling the hill condition",
    "is stated by gladman ( 1993 ) to be sufficient but not necessary for overall stability in the system s dynamics .",
    "the case of the double - lined binary hd141929 , observed and investigated by carrier ( 2002 ) , was used to show how the pofp treats a degenerate three - body structure .",
    "the analysis of this stellar system included a reproduction of the published results using the kc model , at least two viable newtonian solutions competing with the published and reproduced ones , an error analysis on all solutions , and a @xmath33 surface showing the expected stability properties of the system . because the process was started with as few assumptions as was possible about the system ( such as the stellar mass of the primary derived from its spectral type ) , a relatively general initial population was given to the ga .",
    "the solutions produced were all in the form of a translating binary with a small third mass at a distance , typically ejected from the hierarchy .",
    "these solutions can then be optimised further with the third mass set to an insignificant value .",
    "the error analysis of the kc reproduction , showing values close to the published ones is showin in table 3 .",
    "some of the main results for this system are shown in table 4 .      to demonstrate the intricacies of the pofp analysis and its intepretation , the more complex case of hd160691",
    "was chosen .",
    "although more rv data of this system have accumulated since the publication referred to in this paper , the case of hd160691 is brought as an example of an analysis which is both comperable to other publications at a given point of time , and a work in progress .",
    "some of the conclusions eminating from this analysis , especially in light of the new data , allow for the exploration of new directions in research .",
    "the rv observations of hd160691 and a double keplerian fit to these data are provided by mccarthy et al .",
    "the authors discuss stability analyses done by bois et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and go@xmath32dziewski & maciejewski ( 2003 ) .",
    "tables 1 and 2 here show the published result , its keplerian reproduction , and the pofp solutions for this star , in a form compatible with the literature .",
    "for all solutions generated here , it is assumed that the data were taken using a single instrument .",
    "table 1 contains the stellar mass and the quantities for the first planet , along with the @xmath59 and rms of each fit ) without subtracting the uncertainty due to jitter ( @xmath44 ) from it , making it higher than @xmath67 discussed in  4 . ] , and the stellar offset velocities .",
    "table 2 contains the properties of the second planet and comments regarding both planets . in all of these solutions ,",
    "the stellar mass was not allowed to vary by more than 15 percents from the published value of @xmath68 .",
    "the maximum radial velocity for each planetary mass @xmath69 around the star was calculated as @xmath70 .    [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     an analysis based on the translation from the published double keplerian solution , into the pofp 12-tuple , was carried out by calculating the surface of fitness as a function of the two masses ( or inclinations ) , for the lowest @xmath65 in each grid - point ( see @xmath71 and appendices c , e ) .",
    "4 shows the surface , viewed along the @xmath33 axis ( in the origin s direction ) , where the different heights of the fitness are represented by a range of colours .",
    "5 is a simplified contour plot of the main features shown in fig 4 . with the kc parameters used to generate newtonian initial conditions for the * solver *",
    ", the reproduced kc solution @xmath72 , with @xmath73 now has a minimum , @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath33 values of the pofp solutions given in table 1 are closely comparable to the best @xmath75 values derived from the kc parameters of @xmath72 .",
    "because the masses derived in a pofp solution are only bounded by @xmath76 , they are not limited to the range set by the kc , allowing for a solution outside the region boxed by the fitness surface and the constant surface representing the single fitness value of @xmath72 .",
    "this point is discussed further in subsequent papers in the context of both fits for different stellar systems and stability analysis .    , looking down the fitness axis , for hd160691 .",
    "the fitness was calculated on a mass grid of @xmath77 mass values .",
    "the fitness scale is shown as a colour bar on the right , with a minimum value of @xmath78.,width=317 ]     on the fitness surface ( bluer regions in fig .",
    "4),width=317 ]      reconstructing planetary orbits by fitting rv measurements is an inverse problem , and as such , it is reasonable to expect multiple solutions that are consistent with the data .",
    "the variety of cases , @xmath79 , demonstrate the nature of the pofp operation as an attempt to solve this inverse problem , and the types of solutions it can produce . in the interpretation presented here , the fit for every solution is judged by the three criteria , in order : @xmath59 , rms , and stability .",
    "only when considering all three , will the viability of a particular solution be realized .",
    "the interchange between stability and lower @xmath59 is demonstrated , for example , in the differences between solutions @xmath80 increasing in stability with the rms rising along with the @xmath59 ( dropping again for @xmath81 ) . as discussed in @xmath6 and @xmath82 , the issue of stability",
    "is addressed by both direct integration and the hill stability analysis .",
    "the hill difference is apparent as a general trend but , depending on the actual value for a particular solution , may not be definite .",
    "the capacity for generality in the geometry of the pofp solutions is apparent in this regard by noting that solutions @xmath83 are co - planar , nearly co - planar and completely three dimensional respectively",
    ". solutions @xmath84 and @xmath85 demonstrate the same value of @xmath59 , with the former being possibly unstable while the stability of the latter being well supported .",
    "this difference in stability , also shown by the respective rms values , is possibly related to the large mass of the first planet occurring in @xmath84 only . following the arguments and methods presented in @xmath6 , @xmath82 , and in this section ,",
    "the disparity between a keplerian fit and a newtonian fit is also expressed in the different values of their fitness function , assuming the same jitter effect ( see also fig .",
    "4 ) . in any event",
    ", a full consideration of all three criteria seems crucial in order to assess the acceptability of a model for a given solution and understand its implications .",
    "this full consideration is also necessary in order to compare between different solutions representing the same model and between different models .",

    "solutions @xmath89 are three dimensional .",
    "all of these solutions have eccentricity values smaller than @xmath90 .",
    "the lowest fit is that of the unstable solution @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",

    "considering the dispersion across the variety of solutions over the periods shows that the inner period is well constrained ( and in agreement with the literature and its reproduction ) .",
    "the outer period , however , is not . of the six stable - suspected solutions mentioned above",
    ", @xmath93 have similar outer periods , differing from those of @xmath85 and @xmath81 ( which also differ from one another ) and from the literature and reproduction .",

    "a fit that may determine the period of the second planet will provide a distinction between pofp and other models .",
    "pofp fits based on such data ( for example the harps data used in pepe 2006 ) are discussed in subsequent publications .    examining the features of the fitness surface",
    "provides an insight as to the relation between the newtonian pofp and the keplerian ( or kc ) approximation . of prime interest",
    "is the question of gravitational interaction in a physically realistic model .",
    "the significance of pofp in that regard , compared to other models , is expressed here in two ways .",
    "one is the variation in fitness across the @xmath64 domain of the surface , compared to the fitness value provided by the keplerian solution .",
    "for example , the @xmath94 value provided in @xmath72 requires a specific range of masses in this domain .",
    "alternatively , the values of @xmath95 provided by @xmath72 correspond on the surface to higher values in @xmath75 than the @xmath94 tabulated . the gap between the pofp and the keplerian model is also exhibited with solutions existing outside the allowable keplerian mass region and have a reasonable @xmath33 , rms , and are stable ( for example , @xmath81 in table 1 ) . the high rcs and rms of most of the pofp orbits ( represented by the points of the surface ) indicate that mutual planetary interaction plays a crucial role in considering the physics behind the models and in any comparison between them .",
    "the fact that viable pofp solutions , with masses not allowed in the keplerian parameter space , exist , further emphasizes this point .",
    "the use of fundamental physical principles while preserving generality - physical , geometrical , and structural - allows the production of orbital solutions by pofp that are diverse , yet physically realistic .",
    "as demonstrated by the hd160691 analysis , the use of the pofp , especially considering the variety of independent optimisation methods it is structured around , raises some interesting issues .",
    "perhaps the most distinct of those is the acceptability of the multiple ( here , double ) keplerian model .",
    "on the one hand , comparison between the pofp and the keplerian ( or kc ) predictions leads to the question of what constitutes sufficient viability of any model with respect to observations and also in comparison to another model .",
    "considerations concerning the conditions for measuring a fit and the interpretation accompanying these conditions are highly valuable in assessing a comprehensive realistic description of natural phenomena .",
    "this issue has been expressed in this research with the requirement for making a wise use of the @xmath2 and with arguments , such as the ones discussed earlier , regarding the necessity of the triple criteria for the acceptance of a fit ( @xmath2 , rms and stability ) .",
    "these considerations demonstrate a discussion concerning the foundation of scientific explanations . on the other hand , from a physical standpoint",
    ", the analysis of pofp solutions or a comparison between those and their keplerian counterparts is linked to the question of gravitational interaction between multiple orbital elements , such as planets .",
    "the translation of kc into newtonian information suggests that the former may be incomplete , regardless of the question of compatibility with the observed quantities .    in light of attempting to address those issues ,",
    "at least two directions of utilizing the pofp will follow .",
    "one use is the study of other stellar systems suspected of including planets .",
    "an example of that is the investigation , relating to the existing literature , of rv data for 47 uma and hd12661 , which will appear in paper ii ( and is also based on the existing investigation in windmiller ( 2006 ) ) .",
    "such studies are not limited to three - body configurations as an analysis of the suspected multiple - planetary system @xmath96 cancri a , on paper iii , will show .",
    "the other avenue in which the pofp can be used constructively is the vast topic of stability .",
    "assessing instability in each solution via a full three - body integration is computationally expensive , while short time - span integration can only hint at such a possibility .",
    "thus , the preliminary check for instability ( though it may rely on founded criteria such as the hill condition ) like the one described for each solution here , must be expanded into a consistent methodical set of tools allowing for a rigorous analysis .",
    "a more thorough study of stability , based in part on the fitness surface described above and that may possibly point in a systematic direction , will be described in a future paper .",
    "the research reflected in this paper and the effort of writing and bringing it to print has been made possible through the constant support of the san diego state university astronomy department . in particular , we d like to thank dr . fred talbert for his relentless efforts of thorough commentation on drafts of this paper and the thesis work preceding it .",
