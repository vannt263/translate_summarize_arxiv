    "the lhc era that is about to start is expected to unravel the mysteries of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking and the origin of the gauge hierarchy . among the theories that attempt to explain the hierarchy problem",
    ", the randall - sundrum model  @xcite stands out as one of the most promising ones .",
    "the well - known little hierarchy problem becomes , however , critical in such a model .",
    "in fact , it is not just a matter of fine - tuning , but also that the ew precision data turn out to be so constraining that the masses of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of bulk fields are pushed to scales that make their discovery at the lhc extremely challenging . even though placing the fermions ( together with the gauge bosons ) in the bulk softens the constraints , there is still a very large contribution to the peskin - takeuchi  @xcite @xmath3 parameter  @xcite .",
    "the presence of infrared ( ir ) brane kinetic terms  @xcite can reduce the size of the oblique corrections and , if large enough , induce a spectrum of gauge kk modes accessible at colliders  @xcite . in this paper we will consider a different alternative based on custodial symmetry . it was noticed in  @xcite that extending the bulk gauge symmetry to a _ custodially symmetric _",
    "@xmath7 , also reduces the tree level contribution to the @xmath3 parameter to phenomenologically allowed levels for masses of the kk excitations of the gauge bosons @xmath8 tev . at the same time , the right - handed ( rh ) quarks were included in doublets under the @xmath9 symmetry bringing with them @xmath9-symmetric partners that in the case of the rh top quark can be very light .",
    "unfortunately , this mode mixes with the bottom quark and induces anomalous couplings to the @xmath4 that again puts strong constraints on these models , pushing the kk modes beyond experimental detectability .",
    "however , it has been very recently pointed out  @xcite that the custodial symmetry _ together _ with a discrete @xmath10 symmetry can protect the @xmath11 coupling to the @xmath4 from anomalous corrections , therefore apparently saving the last hurdle for a realistic randall - sundrum model with small brane kinetic terms and observable kk modes at the lhc . in this article",
    "we show that , although the custodial and @xmath12 parity symmetries are very powerful in rendering the tree level contributions to the @xmath3 parameter and the @xmath13 coupling very small , the quantum numbers we are forced upon to get such a protection  bidoublets under the @xmath14 symmetry  typically induce sizable and negative contributions to @xmath3 at the loop level .",
    "such negative contribution to the @xmath3 parameter , together with a positive value of the @xmath5 parameter greatly constraint the masses of the kk modes .",
    "a scan over parameter space shows however that there are regions where the sign of @xmath3 is reversed and gauge boson kk masses , @xmath8 tev , can be compatible with experimental data .",
    "hence , we obtain the first randall - sundrum model with negligible brane kinetic terms that is fully compatible with ew precision observables and has gauge boson kk masses accessible at the lhc .    the above scenarios are based on a fundamental higgs field , and suffer from the little hierarchy problem .",
    "an alternative theory of ew symmetry breaking , that does not require any fundamental scalars , has received a lot of attention recently in the context of models with extra dimensions .",
    "these are the models of `` gauge - higgs unification ''  @xcite , where the higgs field is a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson that arises as the component along the extra dimensions of gauge fields of broken symmetries .",
    "the higher dimensional gauge symmetry protects the higgs from cut - off sensitive corrections making its potential , that arises at the quantum level , finite and therefore calculable .",
    "a very simple , yet realistic example is based on an @xmath15 bulk symmetry broken to @xmath16 on the ir brane and to @xmath17 on the uv brane .",
    "the higgs field corresponds to the zero mode of the @xmath18 gauge boson along the broken direction @xmath19",
    "the extended gauge symmetry makes models of gauge - higgs unification very predictive and therefore also very constrained . in particular , a light higgs is a generic prediction of these models .",
    "also , the fact that yukawa couplings are really gauge couplings reduces the freedom to play with the location of the zero modes and makes it more difficult to cancel the negative contribution to the @xmath3 parameter generated by the bidoublets .",
    "interestingly , the allowed regions of parameter space typically lead to fermion states well under a tev .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : lrmodels ] we introduce the custodially symmetric version of the rs model with a fundamental higgs , not necessarily localized on the ir brane , and review the constraints coming from oblique parameters and the @xmath20 coupling .",
    "we show that , as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the absence of large brane kinetic terms , in order to obtain light enough kk states , accessible at the lhc , the left - handed ( lh ) quarks are required to belong to bidoublets of @xmath21 . in section  [ sec : tparameter ] we compute in detail the one - loop contributions to the @xmath3 parameter and show that the bidoublets induce a sizable , negative @xmath3 in most regions of parameter space .",
    "we then consider models of gauge - higgs unification in section  [ sec : gaughiggs ] , and identify the regions of parameter space allowed by the ew precision measurements . in section  [ phenomenology ]",
    "we present the most relevant features of the phenomenology of this type of models , and we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider an @xmath23 gauge theory on a slice of @xmath24 with metric ds^2 = e^-2ky _ dx^ dx^ -dy^2 , and fifth - dimensional coordinate @xmath25 .",
    "the fermions are allowed to propagate in the bulk . in order to address the gauge hierarchy problem",
    ", the higgs field has to be localized near the ir brane ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we will analyze both the case of a higgs exactly localized on the ir brane , as well as the case of a higgs propagating in the bulk , as it occurs in gauge - higgs unification scenarios .",
    "the gauge group is broken by boundary conditions to the standard model ( sm ) on the uv brane ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is done with the following assignment of boundary conditions w^a_l ~(+,+ )  , b_~(+,+ )  , + w^b_r ~(-,+ )  , z^_~(-,+ )  , where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) stands for neumann ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the following two combinations of neutral gauge bosons b_=  , z^_=  , with @xmath34 the five - dimensional coupling constants of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 groups , respectively .",

    "[ charge ] the modes with @xmath40 boundary conditions have zero modes that make the gauge bosons of the sm whereas the ones with @xmath41 boundary conditions only have massive modes .",

    "the massive gauge bosons induce tree - level corrections to the sm gauge boson masses and to their couplings to the fermions ( as well as four - fermion interactions ) .",
    "given that the kk scale is well above the ew breaking scale , we may treat the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) perturbatively and keep only the leading corrections .",

    "however , it is well known that these effects can be controlled effectively in rs scenarios by localizing the fermions of the first two generations closer to the uv brane than to the ir brane @xcite . in fact , in this region of parameter space the quantities @xmath64 and @xmath62 become essentially independent of the fermion profile , thus leading to universal effects that can be recast in the form of oblique corrections .",
    "furthermore , in this same region it becomes possible to generate the fermion mass hierarchies entirely from the overlaps between the higgs and fermion wavefunctions .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on this scenario , which allows us to parametrize the corrections to the z - pole observables measured at lep and sld together with the mass of the @xmath65 measured at the tevatron and lep2 in terms of the peskin - takeuchi @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath66 parameters @xcite .    for the first two quark and lepton generations as well as",

    "in fact , to describe the z - pole observables it is possible to take into account the most important non - oblique corrections , coming from kk exchange contributions to the fermi constant , @xmath70 , by using the effective parameters of @xcite @xmath71   + \\frac{2 \\pi v^2}{s^2 } g^{\\mu\\mu}_{++}~ , \\label{stu } \\\\ u_{\\rm eff } & = & -8 \\pi v^2 g^{\\mu\\mu}_{++}~. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , g^_++ & = & ^l_0 dy dy    contribution to muon decay from the exchange of the kk towers of the @xmath6 gauge bosons , with @xmath72 the wave function of the muon zero mode . the higgs vev is @xmath73 . in general , there are also terms proportional to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , that have not been included in eq .",
    "( [ stu ] ) since they become negligibly small when the leptons and the first two quark generations are localized close to the uv brane .",
    "furthermore , as is apparent from eq .",
    "( [ zcouplings ] ) , these corrections depend on the relative values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 . hence , whenever these corrections become important , non - universal fermion - gauge - boson couplings are induced , even when all fermions are localized identically .",
    "thus , although localizing the leptons and first two quark generations near the conformal point can be interesting due to the possibility of a small coupling to the lightest gauge boson kk modes , a determination of the bounds requires a global fit to the ew observables and will be presented elsewhere  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on a region of parameter space where an analysis based on the effective parameters @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath66 is sufficient .",
    "consequently , we have not included such terms in eqs .",
    "( [ stu ] ) .",
    "we see in the expression for @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ stu ] ) the custodial symmetry mechanism at work : the largest contribution coming from the fermion - independent terms parametrized by @xmath78 of eq .",
    "( [ v2pp ] ) is partially canceled by the corresponding contribution associated with the @xmath38 gauge boson , parametrized by @xmath57 .",
    "the cancellation is not perfect due to the breaking of the custodial symmetry induced by the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "thus , one finds that the tree - level contribution to the @xmath3 parameter is not identically zero , although , in practice , it is quite small .",
    "we have evaluated the effects due to the kk - tower contributions to @xmath70 , which are also rather small in the region we are considering , so that @xmath79 is very small .",
    "thus , in eq .",
    "( [ stu ] ) it is the @xmath5 parameter that receives the largest contributions , and generically leads to strong bounds on the present class of scenarios .",
    "it is important to note that in the models under study , in which the light fermions are localized far from the ir brane , the @xmath5 parameter is always positive . in section  [ sec : tparameter ]",
    "we will show that the residual loop - level contributions to the @xmath3 parameter are also quite relevant .",
    "the third quark generation doublet needs to be localized closer to the ir brane in order to generate the large top mass . as a result",
    ", one should introduce an additional parameter that allows to describe the difference in the corrections to the coupling of the bottom quark with respect to the light quarks . the accurate measurement of @xmath80 , the ratio of the width of the z - boson decay into bottom - quarks and the total hadronic width , puts strong constraints on this difference . since the lh bottom coupling to the z is roughly five times larger than the rh one , this mostly constrains the former .",
    "the rh coupling , in turn , is mainly constrained by the measurement of the forward - backward and left - right bottom quark asymmetries measured at the lep and sld colliders . however , these constraints are much weaker than those affecting the lh coupling  @xcite . moreover , since the experimental value of @xmath80 is approximately one standard deviation larger than the value predicted by the sm , positive and negative corrections on this coupling are not equally constrained .",
    "approximately , at the 2-@xmath81 level , assuming no large correction to the rh bottom coupling , the constraint on the correction to the lh bottom coupling to the @xmath4 reads  @xcite , @xmath82 since the lh bottom couples to the @xmath35 and/or @xmath83 gauge bosons , the shift in its coupling to the @xmath4 , given in eq .",
    "( [ zcouplings ] ) , receives a contribution from the terms proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "after rescaling the @xmath4 wave function so that its couplings to the first two generations do not present anomalous shifts , the value of the anomalous lh bottom quark coupling to the @xmath4 is given by @xmath85 ~ , \\label{epsilonb}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the @xmath88 isospin and charge quantum numbers of the lh bottom quark , respectively .",
    "@xmath89 is the bottom quark @xmath9 isospin , which is determined by the embedding into the 5d gauge group representation .",
    "for the case of @xmath90 , negative corrections to @xmath91 are generated , that become larger in absolute value as the lh bottom is localized closer to the infrared brane . indeed , for @xmath92 , eq .",
    "( [ epsilonb ] ) gives @xmath93",
    "\\approx \\frac{e^2}{s^2 c^2 }   \\left [ g^{b_{l}}_{++ } -   0.09   g^{b_{l}}_{-+ } -   g^f_{++ } \\right ] ~. \\label{epsilonb : dobletes}\\ ] ] these corrections are depicted by the curve labeled by `` gauge '' in fig .  1 , which we will explain in more detail below , and become small",
    "as we separate @xmath94 ( and @xmath95 ) from the ir brane , in which case the coupling of the bottom and the light fermions to the @xmath4 become similar .",
    "note however that @xmath95 can not be too far from the ir brane , since this would lead to an unacceptably small top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "we can also see how , when the lh bottom acquires a non - vanishing value of @xmath76 , the @xmath9 custodial symmetry can protect the bottom coupling to the @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "if we set @xmath96 for @xmath94 , together with @xmath97 , the anomalous coupling greatly simplifies @xmath98 ~ , \\label{epsilonb : bidobletes}\\ ] ] and the contributions from @xmath99 and @xmath84 tend to cancel as a result of the custodial symmetry and the quantum numbers of the bottom . as was the case for the @xmath3 parameter , the breaking due to the boundary conditions makes the cancellation imperfect . notice that the degree of cancellation depends on both the bottom localization and the higgs profile .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath99 and @xmath84 are different even when the bottom and higgs fields are exactly localized on the ir brane , a residual effect still remains in this limit .. when the higgs is not exactly localized , the residual difference is about twice as large due to the tail of the higgs wavefunction that `` feels '' the breaking of the custodial symmetry away from the ir brane .",
    "] in fact , one finds that the difference @xmath100 increases slightly as the lh bottom comes closer to the ir brane .    since @xmath101 measures the deviation of the bottom coupling to the @xmath4 relative to the couplings of the first two generations , eq .",
    "( [ epsilonb : bidobletes ] ) receives an extra contribution from @xmath102 .",
    "in particular , for an appropriate localization of the fermion fields , it is possible for the terms in eq .",
    "( [ epsilonb : bidobletes ] ) to cancel exactly , but we do not explore such a possibility here .",
    "thus , although the anomalous @xmath103 coupling is small , it is not necessarily irrelevant .",
    "in addition to the corrections due to the presence of massive spin-1 fields given in the previous section there are extra tree - level contributions to the couplings of the fermions to the sm gauge fields .",
    "these arise from integrating out the fermion kk modes that mix with the fermion zero - modes through the higgs vev .",
    "given that we are taking the first two generations to be localized away from the higgs field , for the light quarks and leptons these mixing effects are exponentially suppressed due to the associated zero - mode wavefunction . however , for the third generation such effects can be important , as pointed out in @xcite .    as we will see , in the models of ref .",
    "@xcite this constraint by itself is strong enough to put the higher dimensional physics beyond the reach of the lhc .",
    "we conclude that a mechanism that suppresses the anomalous @xmath103 coupling as outlined at the end of the previous section seems to be an essential ingredient for these models to be viable .",
    "thus , we start by studying the class of models with custodial @xmath104 , where the sm lh top and bottom arise from 5d @xmath35 singlets and the rh top arises from an @xmath35 doublet :    rclcrcl q_l & = &    q^t_l(+,+ ) + q^b_l(+,+ )    , & & q_r & = &    t_r(+,+ ) + b_r(-,+ )    ,    where , under @xmath22 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we also indicated the boundary conditions by assigning parities at the uv and ir branes , respectively .",
    "parity assignment stands for a dirichlet boundary condition at the corresponding brane . for fermions ,",
    "a dirichlet boundary condition for a given 4d chirality fixes , through the equations of motion , the boundary condition obeyed by the opposite chirality .",
    "we denote this boundary condition by a @xmath28 parity assignment .",
    "it is , in general , a condition on the first derivative with respect to the extra - dimensional coordinate . ]",
    "the choice of parities is determined by the requirement that the low - energy theory should have a lh doublet and a rh top , and by the requirement that @xmath35 be preserved on the ir brane .",
    "we exhibit only the parities for the chiralities containing zero modes .",
    "the parity assignments for the opposite chiralities can be simply read from these .",
    "the important point is that reproducing the top mass requires the localization of the zero mode in @xmath107 near the ir brane .",
    "( as we mentioned in the previous section and will make explicit below , the lh doublet @xmath108 can not be taken too close to the ir brane due to large corrections to the anomalous @xmath11 couplings . )",
    "this in turn implies that the lightest mode of @xmath109 , a state with the quantum numbers of the rh bottom , becomes rather light .",

    "( [ epsilonb : dobletes ] ) , as well as the contribution due to the mixing with the lightest @xmath109 states .",
    "the gauge contribution depends only on @xmath113 and the kk scale @xmath115 .",
    "the contribution due to mixing depends on @xmath116 , the localization parameter for @xmath117 , and only very slightly on @xmath118 .",

    "the @xmath116 dependence enters both through the wavefunctions and the mass of the lightest @xmath109 state .",

    "we thus see that @xmath112 gives a rather model independent bound on scenarios where the rh top arises from a 5d @xmath35 doublet , and that the bounds are rather severe , most likely putting the gauge boson kk sates beyond the reach of upcoming collider experiments . for example , even for @xmath126 , the constraint eq .",

    "there are either no states with the quantum numbers of the lh bottom in the multiplets that couple through the top yukawa coupling , or they come in pairs whose effects cancel against each other ( due to the symmetry exchanging @xmath1 with @xmath2 )",

    "the anomalous couplings are easily within the experimental limits , which gives a strong motivation for including the mechanism of ref .",

    "the custodial @xmath104 symmetry , which is broken only by boundary conditions , ensures that the contribution to the t parameter due to fermion loops is finite .",
    "nevertheless , the finite contributions involving the kk modes of the top quark impose significant constraints .",
    "in fact , we will see that making the top - bottom doublet part of a bidoublet of @xmath14 implies a rather definite prediction for the 1-loop contributions to the t parameter .",
    "we concentrate here on the top sector since it gives the largest effects .",
    "other one - loop contributions to t , due to gauge bosons and light fermions , are much smaller  @xcite .",
    "the cancellation of the contributions to @xmath91 advocated in @xcite requires that the lh bottom be part of a @xmath22 bidoublet , with @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131 , which implies from eq .",

    ". their masses are m_q_1 470  gev  , m_q_2 495  gev  , m_u_2 742  gev  .",
    "the mixing between the top quark and the latter mode is about @xmath298 .",
    "there are additional fermion states starting at about @xmath299 .",
    "light vector - like quarks that mix strongly with the top have two main phenomenological effects .",
    "first , anomalous couplings of the sm quarks to the @xmath4 and @xmath65 bosons  @xcite are induced due to mixing .",
    "for instance , in the numerical example we are considering the lh top coupling to the @xmath4 and the @xmath300 coupling are reduced by @xmath301 the @xmath302 coupling has not been directly measured yet .",
    "early studies for single top production at the tevatron  @xcite show that it may be measured with a precision of about 10  % for a total integrated luminosity of order 8  fb@xmath303 . at the lhc",
    ", this coupling is expected to be measured to a @xmath304@xmath305 precision  @xcite .",
    "apart from the effect of the mixing with the fermion kk modes , there is an extra effect due to the mixing of the @xmath4 with the _ gauge _ kk modes , similar to the one we discussed for the bottom couplings in section  [ sec : gaugecorrections ] .",
    "actually , the mechanism that protects the bottom quark coupling from corrections can not simultaneously protect the top couplings  @xcite .",
    "( [ epsilonb ] ) applies equally well to the top quark where we now have @xmath306 for the lh ( rh ) top quark chirality .",
    "this results in a very small modification of the rh coupling ( recall that the one loop contribution to the @xmath3 parameter requires the rh top to leave not so close to the ir brane ) whereas the lh coupling is modified by a factor @xmath307 whereas the @xmath302 coupling receives a correction @xmath308 as we see , this effect is smaller than the one coming from mixing with fermion kk modes . apart from modifications of the diagonal top couplings ,",
    "flavor changing neutral couplings ( fcnc ) are also generated both through mixing with vector - like quarks and due to the different top quark couplings in the gauge eigenstate basis that get mixed in the physical basis .",
    "these effects depend on the mixing with the first two families that we have not considered in detail here .",
    "the latter effect has been recently discussed in  @xcite with the result that fcnc possibly observable at the lhc can be generated .",
    "recall , however , that due to the constraints associated with the @xmath3 parameter it is the lh top that is localized closer to the ir brane , and therefore it receives the largest modifications to its couplings .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , instead , assumed that the largest effects appear in the rh sector .",
    "another phenomenological implication of light vector - like fermions is of course the possibility of direct production at colliders .",
    "the two relevant modes that are light and mix with the top are , in the gauge eigenstate basis , a bidoublet that is an equal admixture of a quark with isospin @xmath309 and isospin @xmath210 ( and therefore its effects due to mixing are typically suppressed ) and a singlet that mixes strongly with the top .",
    "thus , as a first approximation we will consider the phenomenology of just the singlet . a more detailed analysis of the collider phenomenology of these and other fermion kk modes will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "vector - like singlets of charge @xmath133 can be pair or singly produced at colliders .",
    "pair production is quite independent of the heavy quark mixing with the top but the cross section dies off very quickly with the mass of the heavy quark . for instance , the production cross section of a 500  gev quark at the tevatron collider is about 1  fb  @xcite , while it increases to values of a few  pb at the lhc .",
    "such small cross sections at the tevatron imply that searches for these quarks , decaying mainly into third generation states , become quite challenging  @xcite .",
    "searches become much more promising at the lhc .",
    "a recent study  @xcite shows that a 500 gev ( 1 tev ) vector - like quark singlet can be discovered at the lhc with an integrated luminosity of @xmath310 fb@xmath303 ( @xmath311 fb@xmath303 ) thus rendering the signatures of our model easily observable .",
    "single production is not suppressed as much by the mass of the heavy quark but depends on the details of the mixing with the top - bottom sector .",
    "a comparison with the atlas study of little higgs models  @xcite shows that a vector - like singlet with the parameters of our numerical example is well within lhc reach in single production .",
    "in particular the @xmath312 channel looks particularly promising in the discovery of a quark with mass of order @xmath313 gev and a @xmath298 mixing with the top .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the singlet is typically light enough to make pair production competitive with single production .",
    "we have thus seen that realistic models of gauge - higgs unification with gauge kk excitations with masses as low as @xmath314 tev can be constructed .",
    "generic predictions of these models include deviations of the @xmath315 coupling sufficiently large to be observed with the @xmath304@xmath305 accuracy achievable at the lhc , as well as vector - like quarks light enough to be produced at the lhc , both in pairs and together with sm quarks .",
    "alternative choices of quantum numbers and parities , but still compatible with ew precision observables , can have slightly different features regarding the spectrum of bidoublets , but light and strongly mixed vector - like singlets remain as a solid prediction of the models . if we relax the gauge - higgs unification condition and allow for a fundamental higgs as in sections  [ sec : lrmodels ] and  [ sec : tparameter ] , then vector - like singlets do not need to be that light . however , they still need to mix very strongly with the top to compensate for the negative contribution of bidoublets to the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "this typically results in a scenario with somewhat light vector - like bidoublets , with masses @xmath316 tev , and heavy vector - like singlets , with masses @xmath317 tev , which will be more challenging for the lhc .",
    "however , due to the strong mixing , large corrections to the top gauge couplings , in the @xmath318 range , and therefore observable at the lhc , are expected in these models .",
    "the randall - sundrum scenario with gauge and fermion fields propagating in the bulk offers an attractive solution to the hierarchy problem , an understanding of the observed fermion hierarchies by extra - dimensional localization effects , and a natural suppression of dangerous flavor changing processes .",
    "a generic feature of these scenarios is that the third generation is quite different from the first two : by being closer to the ir brane the top quark avoids an exponential suppression in its mass , in contrast with the first two generation quarks and leptons , and can naturally be as heavy as the ew scale .",
    "one can then generically expect important deviations from the sm in this sector , most notably anomalous couplings to the @xmath4 gauge boson , and contributions to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath3 parameter .",
    "the first two generations can also give important contributions to the @xmath5 parameter .",
    "these constraints tend to put the gauge boson kk excitations beyond the reach of the lhc , unless these states are lighter and more weakly coupled than expected , for example due to the presence of moderately large ir brane kinetic terms .    in the absence of brane localized terms , an @xmath0 bulk gauge symmetry together with a discrete symmetry exchanging @xmath1 with @xmath2 @xcite seem to be essential in bringing the contributions to the @xmath3 parameter , and the anomalous contributions to the @xmath319 vertex , under control .",
    "these symmetries , being broken non - locally by boundary conditions , imply that such effects are calculable .",
    "we have seen that they can still place important constraints on these models .",
    "a detailed calculation shows that the 1-loop contributions to the @xmath3 parameter are in general sizable .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the existence of @xmath22 bidoublets , an essential ingredient in these scenarios , gives a negative contribution to the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "contributions coming from singlets or triplets can compensate such effects , but the conspiracy occurs in rather well defined regions of parameter space .",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath3 constraints , in particular , very directly constrain the location of the third generation multiplets . in this regions , however , kk gauge excitations as light as @xmath220 are allowed , thus providing the first example of rs scenarios with negligible brane localized terms , that are consistent with all ew precision data and with gauge boson kk states accessible at the lhc .",
    "we also studied the ew constraints in models in which , in addition to the above structure , the higgs arises from an extra - dimensional gauge field , thus alleviating the little hierarchy problem associated with a 5d scalar field .",
    "these scenarios contain further theoretical relations due to the embedding of the field content into larger gauge multiplets , as well as due to the fact that the yukawa couplings are related to sm gauge couplings . in spite of these restrictions ,",
    "we find that the ew measurements set bounds on the gauge boson kk masses of the order of 3  tev , similar to those found in the absence of the gauge - higgs unification assumption . an important difference , however , is that the required multiplet structure , together with the constraints on the location of the third family , typically lead to light vector - like fermionic excitations . quite generically , a light @xmath6 singlet , that mixes with the top quark , is expected .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that additional light @xmath6 doublet states , some of them with exotic charges , are present .",
    "all these states can easily have masses in the @xmath320 range , and should be observable at the lhc , both by direct ( single or pair ) production and by their effect through mixing on the anomalous couplings of the top . further fermionic excitations starting as low as @xmath321 are also generically expected .",
    "all of these should provide interesting discovery signals and warrant a more detailed study of the associated phenomenology @xcite .",

    "<S> we consider randall - sundrum scenarios based on @xmath0 and a discrete parity exchanging @xmath1 with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the custodial and parity symmetries can be used to make the tree level contribution to the @xmath3 parameter and the anomalous couplings of the bottom quark to the @xmath4 very small . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the resulting quantum numbers typically induce a negative @xmath3 parameter at one loop that , together with the positive value of the @xmath5 parameter , restrict considerably these models . </S>",
    "<S> there are nevertheless regions of parameter space that successfully reproduce the fit to electroweak precision observables with light kaluza - klein excitations accessible at colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we consider models of gauge - higgs unification that implement the custodial and parity symmetries and find that the electroweak data singles out a very well defined region in parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> in this region one typically finds light gauge boson kaluza - klein excitations as well as light @xmath6 singlet , and sometimes also doublet , fermionic states , that mix with the top quark , and that may yield interesting signatures at future colliders . </S>"
