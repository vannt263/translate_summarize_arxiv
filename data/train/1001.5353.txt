    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulator is a rapidly growing field of research in the condensed matter physics .",
    "@xcite because the bulk of a topological insulator belongs to a different @xmath5 topological class @xcite than the vacuum , on the surface of a 3d topological insulator emerges an intrinsically metallic two - dimensional ( 2d ) state which hosts helically spin - polarized dirac fermions .",
    "@xcite besides the profound implications of those spin - helical 2d dirac fermions on future spintronics , the topological insulator is expected to present various exotic quantum phenomena associated with its non - trivial topology .",
    "@xcite    motivated by theoretical predictions , @xcite three materials have so far been experimentally confirmed @xcite to be 3d topological insulators : bi@xmath6sb@xmath7 , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , and bi@xmath0te@xmath1 . the angle - resolved photoemission experiments @xcite have played decisive roles in indentifying the topologically nontrivial nature of their surface states .",
    "more recently , scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments @xcite have elucidated the protection of the surface state from spin - nonconserving scattering .",
    "in addition to those surface - sensitive probes , transport experiments are obviously important for understanding the macroscopic properties of topological insulators and for exploiting the applications of their novel surface state .",
    "however , capturing a signature of the surface state of a topological insulator in its transport properties has proved difficult : the surface state has been seen by quantum oscillations only in bi@xmath6sb@xmath7 at a particular sb concentration of 9% ; @xcite the universal conductance fluctuations associated with the surface state were observed only in ca - doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 after careful tuning of the carrier density ; @xcite the aharonov - bohm oscillations through the surface state were observed only in very narrow nanoribbons of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite most often , the transport properties are dominated by the bulk conductivity due to residual carriers.@xcite    in this context , we have very recently found @xcite that the 2d surface state of the topological insulator bi@xmath8sb@xmath9 gives rise to new types of oscillatory phenomena in the angular - dependence of the magnetoresistance ( mr ) .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that the oscillations observed at lower fields provide a way to distinguish the 2d fermi surface ( fs ) in bi@xmath8sb@xmath9 , while another type of oscillations of unknown origin was found to become prominent at higher fields . in the present work ,",
    "we have tried to elucidate whether this new tool , the angular - dependence of the mr , can distinguish the 2d surface state in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , which is believed to be the most promising topological insulator for investigating the novel topological effects because of its simple surface - state structure .",
    "@xcite we observed pronounced angular - dependent oscillations of the mr in an @xmath10-type bi@xmath0se@xmath1 single crystal with the carrier density @xmath11 = 5@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 , but our detailed analysis clarified that the observed oscillations are solely due to the landau quantization of the anisotropic bulk fs of this material .",
    "nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , such an angular - dependent mr oscillations in a 3d material has never been explicitly demonstrated in the literature , so the present results nicely supplement our general understanding of the angular - dependent mr oscillation phenomena .",
    "in addition , our analysis provides a solid ground for discriminating the contributions of the 2d and 3d fss in the angular - dependence of the mr in future studies of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 single crystals with much lower carrier density .",
    "high - quality bi@xmath12se@xmath13 single crystals were grown by melting stoichiometric mixtures of 99.9999% purity bi and 99.999% purity se elements in sealed evacuated quartz tubes .",
    "after slow cooling from the melting point down to about 550@xmath14c over two days , crystals were kept at this temperature for several days and then were furnace - cooled to room temperature . the obtained crystals are easily cleaved and reveal a flat shiny surface .",

    "@xcite this discrepancy is due , at least partly , to the fact that the present @xmath27 was measured in the low - field limit and contains the so - called hall factor , which is usually between 1  2 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the sdh oscillations was measured for two field directions , along the @xmath19 and @xmath20 axes .",
    "figure 3(c ) shows the @xmath32 data in @xmath23 for some selected temperatures , where one can see that the background mr is essentially temperature - independent and that oscillations are still visible even at 25 k. the inset of fig .",
    "3 ( c ) shows the temperature dependence of the sdh amplitude measured at 12 t for @xmath18 along @xmath19 ( @xmath40 = 0@xmath14 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath40 = 90@xmath14 ) . the fits with the standard lifshitz - kosevich theory @xcite",
    "yield the cyclotron mass @xmath56 of 0.14@xmath41 and 0.24@xmath41 for @xmath40 = 0@xmath14 and 90@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the energy dispersion near the conduction band minimum of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is known to be parabolic , @xcite and the observed anisotropy in @xmath56 for the given fs is entirely consistent with the parabolic dispersion to within 5% .",
    "relying on this dispersion , the fermi energy @xmath57 is calculated to be 56 mev and the fermi velocity @xmath58 is 3.8@xmath210@xmath59 cm / s for any direction .    the dingle plots [ shown in fig .",
    "3(d ) for @xmath23 as an example ] yield the dingle temperature @xmath42 = 9.5 k which is almost isotropic and is constant at low temperature ; this gives an isotropic scattering time @xmath60 = 1.3@xmath210@xmath61 s , implying the mean free path @xmath62",
    "(= @xmath63 ) of @xmath2650 nm and the mobility @xmath64 of about 1600 @xmath65/vs , which is almost four times smaller than @xmath30 estimated from @xmath27 . such a discrepancy between @xmath66 and @xmath30 has long been noted in various systems , @xcite and the essential reason lies in the difference in how the effective scattering time comes about from the microscopic scattering process : @xcite the scattering rate @xmath67 determining transport properties acquires the additional factor @xmath68 upon spatial averaging ( @xmath69 is the scattering angle ) , while @xmath70 to govern the dephasing in the quantum oscillations is given by a simple spatial averaging without such a factor .",
    "hence , if the small - angle scattering becomes dominant ( which is often the case at low temperature ) , @xmath67 can be much smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the mean free path in our sample can be even larger than that estimated above .",

    "( 1 ) for the same magnetic fields as in ( a ) . ]",
    "the new observation of the present work is the oscillatory angular - dependence of the mr shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , where , on top of the two - fold - symmetric background angular dependence , pronounced oscillations are evident at higher fields .",
    "importantly , the peak positions shift with magnetic field , which is different from the ordinary angular - dependent mr oscillations ( amro ) in quasi - low - dimensional systems . @xcite in the following , we show that these oscillations are due to the landau quantization of the 3d fs and , hence , are essentially of the same origin as the sdh oscillations .",
    "the sdh oscillations occur as the landau - quantized cylinders in the brillouin zone expand and cross the fs with increasing magnetic field , while the angular - dependent oscillations occur as the axis of those cylinders rotates in the brillouin zone .",
    "obviously , no oscillation is expected for rotating magnetic field when the fs is spherical , but when the fs is anisotropic , the number of cylinders residing within the fs changes as the cylinder axis is rotated , leading to resistivity oscillations .",
    "therefore , an anisotropy in the fs is a necessary ingredient for the angular - dependent oscillations .    .",
    "open circles show the experimental data [ symmetrical component of @xmath32 ] ; the dashed line demonstrates the low - field quadratic dependence of the resistivity , @xmath72 ; the dash - dotted line represents the high - field saturation limit , @xmath73 ; the solid line is the resulting reconstructed background , @xmath74 ( see text ) .",
    "the left and right insets show the obtained angular dependences of the coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath73 within the @xmath39 plane . ]    to show that the observed angular - dependent oscillations are essentially due to the landau quantization , it is most convincing to reconstruct the angular - dependence of the mr based on the sdh oscillations data .",
    "for this purpose , one needs to understand the exact magnetic - field dependence of the mr in the presence of the sdh effect , and know how it evolves when the magnetic field is rotated .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath32 data for @xmath35 ( @xmath45 ) , which we take as an example for presenting our procedure to extract the necessary information . at low magnetic fields , the mr in fig .",
    "5 exhibits an almost quadratic field dependence , which can be fitted by @xmath76 . with increasing magnetic field , the mr tends to saturate , while pronounced sdh oscillations develop at the same time .",
    "the overall background mr @xmath74 can be described as @xmath77 , which combines the low - field quadratic behavior and the high - field saturation of @xmath32 .",
    "this background develops on top of the zero - field resistivity @xmath78 of about 0.28 m@xmath29 cm .",
    "the same fitting of the background of mr can be made for the whole range of the magnetic - field direction .",
    "the evolutions of the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath73 with @xmath40 in the @xmath39 plane are shown in the left and right insets of fig .",
    "5 . note that the center of the symmetry for both @xmath79 and @xmath80 is shifted from @xmath40 = 0@xmath14 by about 12@xmath14 , which is probably due to the rhombohedral symmetry of the crystal which leads to the appearance of cross terms @xcite in the magnetic - field expansion of the resistivity tensor.@xcite    once @xmath81 is known as functions of both @xmath40 and @xmath18 , one can superpose the sdh oscillations to obtain the expected @xmath82 . in the case of our bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , thanks to the fact that the sdh oscillations are composed of only one frequency , one can simulate experimental data as @xmath83 \\right ) , \\nonumber \\\\                       & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are temperature , dingle , and spin damping factors , respectively .",
    "@xcite as shown in fig . 2 by thin solid lines ,",
    "the experimentally observed sdh oscillations are reproduced reasonably well with eq .",
    "( 1 ) with a parameter @xmath87 = 0.12 which is independent of @xmath40",
    ".    the same set of parameters can be used to calculate the angular - dependent mr for fixed @xmath18 , @xmath88 , with eq .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , where one can easily see that the calculated angular dependences of the mr follow very closely the rather complicated patterns of the observed @xmath88 .",
    "this gives compelling evidence that the angular - dependent oscillations are essentially due to the landau quantization of the anisotropic 3d fs .",
    "it was emphasized in ref . that a merit of measuring the angular - dependence of the mr is that at sufficiently high magnetic field , the 3d fs remains in the quantum limit ( where all the electrons condense into the 1st landau level ) and do not contribute to the angular - dependent oscillations , while the 2d fs will always produce mr oscillations when the magnetic - field direction is nearly parallel to the 2d plane .",
    "once the density of the residual carriers in a topological insulator sample is sufficiently reduced , the 3d fs should be easily brought into the quantum limit and the 2d fs would become distinguishable in the angular - dependent mr oscillations . also , the sdh effect needs a certain range of magnetic field for the oscillations to be recognized , whereas the observation of the angular - dependent oscillations can be made only at the highest field ; this gives a certain practical advantage to the latter method when the quantization condition is only barely achieved with the available magnetic field .",
    "therefore , one would expect that the angular - dependence of the mr will be a useful tool for distinguishing the 2d surface state of the topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 when a single crystal with much lower carrier density becomes available .",
    "in conclusion , we observed pronounced angular - dependent oscillations of the mr in high - quality single crystals of @xmath10-type bi@xmath0se@xmath1 with @xmath11 = 5@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "we show , by simulating the angular - dependent oscillations based on the information obtained from the sdh analysis , that the oscillations are essentially due to the landau quantization of the 3d bulk fermi surface .",
    "this provides a compelling demonstration of how the landau quantization of an anisotropic 3d fs can give rise to pronounced angular - dependent mr oscillations .",
    "furthermore , the present results pave the way for distinguishing the 2d surface state in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 in future studies of the angular - dependent mr , by completely elucidating the oscillations due to the bulk fs .",

    "3(a ) , which suggests that there may be a weak contribution from a second frequency .",
