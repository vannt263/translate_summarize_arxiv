    "the acceleration of the expansion rate of the universe is still a deep mystery despite more than ten years of intense activity both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite . if the acceleration of the universe is due to an unknown form of matter , dark energy , it comprises more than seventy percent of the energy budget of the universe .",
    "together with dark matter , some ninety five percent of the energy contents of the universe are unknown to us and only detected through indirect cosmological and gravitational astrophysical probes .",
    "of course , the situation would be greatly clarified if some imprint of the existence of dark energy could be discovered experimentally . in this sense , looking for dark energy can be put in parallel with the search for dark matter ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for dark matter ,",
    "the detection methods comprise the identification of potential candidates in the laboratory ( ranging from experiments at the lhc looking for very heavy new particles to light - shining - through - a - wall experiments at the opposite end of the mass scale ) as well as finding signatures in astrophysical environments like the production of axions in the sun for example .",
    "even if dark matter particles were found , dedicated efforts would be required to ascertain that these candidates do act as the pervading astrophysical dark matter .",
    "hence experimental searches for dark matter in indirect ( by looking for annihilation products of dark matter particles for example ) or direct channels are also under scrutiny .",
    "the latter includes scattering experiments mainly focusing on heavy wimp dark matter in the multi-10 gev range and axion dark matter searches in the @xmath0ev mass regime .",
    "searches for dark energy clearly lag behind their dark matter counterparts .",
    "a particular reason for this is the lack of particle candidates as well as realistic proposals for smoking - gun detections of dark energy .",
    "here we propose astrophysical and laboratory experiments to probe a particular class of dark energy models , i.e. the chameleons@xcite , and their distinctive environmentally dependent features .",
    "it should be stressed that even with a clear identification of chameleons in the laboratory , this would not provide a direct explanation to dark energy itself .",
    "specialised experiments would have to be pursued in order to prove that chameleons correspond to the dark energy of the universe .",
    "however , it would clearly be a big step forward in our understanding of the universe if candidates for dark matter and dark energy were identified in the laboratory .",
    "if dark energy is a new form of matter , strong candidates could be scalar fields , which have not been detected so far , interacting with both matter and photons .",
    "indeed , scalar fields can provide the potential energy which would drive the acceleration of the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "unfortunately this implies that the scalar field mass on cosmological scales is of the order of the hubble rate now , i.e. @xmath1 ev .",
    "such a tiny mass would lead to large gravitational effects and the presence of a long range fifth force .",
    "the cassini bound on the coupling of such scalar fields to matter@xcite , together with other gravitational tests in the laboratory@xcite , lead to unnatural models if a screening mechanism were not at play both in the solar system and the laboratory .",
    "fortunately , known screening mechanisms exist such as the thin shell effect for chameleons and the vainshtein mechanism for galileons , involving highly non - linear lagrangians which can only be understood as low energy effective field theories@xcite .",
    "the origin of these models at higher energy is unknown . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on chameleons .",
    "chameleon models can describe the acceleration of the expansion of the universe on large scales while having a density dependent effective mass which explains why they are screened in local experiments .",
    "indeed , the rest mass of chameleons is large inside dense bodies implying that the field inside does not extend further than a scale of order @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mass at a given point in the astrophysical body .",
    "hence , the contributions to the value of the exterior field from inside the body are damped by a large yukawa suppression @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance from a point in the body to another one outside .",
    "only a tiny shell at the surface of the body , called a thin shell , contributes to the field outside the body as the field is not yukawa damped across this thin layer .",
    "therefore the exterior of a body feels the field created only by a small shell and is thus small , i.e. small enough to create a tiny modification of gravity and pass all the gravitational tests on non - cosmological scales .",
    "however , chameleons themselves can have detectable effects in the laboratory .",
    "indeed , they can induce a small but detectable deviation from the casimir force between two metallic plates @xcite .",
    "they can also couple to two photons in a primakoff fashion@xcite and may lead to observable phenomena in optical experiments , if , for example , a laser beam goes across a magnetic region providing a bath of virtual photons@xcite . using the same coupling to two photons , they could be produced in solar magnetic regions in a way akin to the axionic one@xcite .",
    "the main difference between axions and chameleons would be the fact that chameleons couple to the photon polarisation perpendicular to a magnetic field ( pseudo - scalars couple to the parallel polarisation ) , and the crucial variation of their effective mass with the pressure - less energy density of the environment",
    ". given the pressure - less energy density profile , the mass essentially depends on two parameters : an index @xmath6 which characterises the dark energy potential and the coupling constant to matter @xmath7 .",
    "together with the coupling constant to photons @xmath8 , this forms the three parameter family of chameleon models .",
    "notice that for chameleons , the mass has no intrinsic meaning like for axions . here",
    "the index @xmath6 and the two coupling constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 suffice .",
    "if , in a dense magnetised plasma , the chameleon mass matches the plasma frequency of the environment , chameleons can be resonantly produced in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this could happen in the sun in a narrow shell whose location depends on the effective rest mass of the chameleons .",
    "on the other hand , non - resonant production is more widespread and occurs in all magnetised regions inside the sun .",
    "once created either resonantly or non - resonantly across large magnetic regions , chameleons essentially escape from the sun and reach earth where they can enter an helioscope and be back - converted into x - ray photons@xcite .",
    "the fact that the emitted chameleons have a spectrum in the immediate sub - kev range helps them to overcome any barrier .",
    "note that this only holds true as long as their mass in matter is smaller than the chameleon energy .",
    "low energy chameleons are reflected by dense matter .",
    "the chameleon emitted by the sun eventually reach earth where they can enter magnetic helioscopes like cast@xcite and sumico@xcite and be back - converted into x - ray photons .",
    "additionally , a small fraction of the solar chameleons could also be converted into x - ray photons in the photosphere and above , hence providing a possible explanation to the corona puzzle : the corona is hotter above magnetised solar surfaces .",
    "this reasoning has been used also for axions or axion - like particles in @xcite and applies to chameleons as well .",
    "in fact , as we show in this work , one can distinguish the photon emission coming from chameleons from that coming from axion conversion .    in order to estimate the sensitivity of possible experiments",
    ", we have applied present constraints mimicking the ones from the cast experiment and typical of helioscopes , i.e. a background noise of 1 event per hour in the 1 - 7 kev region , to draw the sensitivity region in the chameleon parameter space at the 2@xmath9 level . for the chameleon production inside the sun , we have used the conservative assumption that the solar magnetic field is mainly effective in a shell of 0.01 solar radius around the tachocline where a constant magnetic field of 30 t is commonly assumed to exist with this rather realistic width . with these hypotheses ,",
    "we deduce both the chameleon spectrum and the regenerated photon spectra in a helioscope pipe , the photosphere and the corona . as we find that the photon spectrum is peaked below the main sensitivity region of the present helioscope detectors ,",
    "these limits will be improved with future upgrades .",
    "constraints on the chameleon parameter space have already been given by the chase experiment at fermilab using optical photons@xcite .",
    "in particular for low values of the matter coupling , the coupling to photons is bounded from above @xmath10 . with the assumption concerning the production of chameleons in the sun , due to a shell of 0.01 solar radius ( @xmath11 ) and a magnetic field of 30 t , and a maximal chameleon emission of 10% of the solar luminosity@xcite",
    ", we obtain an energy loss bound on the photon coupling @xmath12 .",
    "this is comparable to the chase bound obtained with optical photons .",
    "however , the results in optical cavities involve many reflections of the chameleons on the beamtube walls and thus are limited by the presence of possible multiple scatterings . to avoid these uncertainties ,",
    "we propose a new x - ray light - shining - through - a - wall experiment where these issues are absent .",
    "similarly , the possible detection of x - ray photons springing from the existence of solar chameleons would be a rather indirect way of studying the properties of chameleons .",
    "to overcome these obstacles , we suggest a new experiment where a photon flux would be injected in a magnetic pipe@xcite . as a result",
    ", chameleons would be produced .",
    "if a wall is introduced after the first magnetic pipe , energetic chameleons would go through the wall and would regenerate photons on the other side downstream . using the energy loss bound on the coupling of chameleons to photons , we find that a 5@xmath9 detection of photons would be within reach with an improved source of photons compared to the ones available now : a smoking gun for chameleons in the laboratory .    in the first part of this paper , we recall general results on chameleons and their production in the sun .",
    "we then calculate the number of back - converted photons in a helioscope pipe .",
    "finally we present a chameleon through wall experiment and we conclude .",
    "chameleons are candidates to generate the recent acceleration of the expansion of the universe . on large scales ,",
    "the chameleon field takes a vacuum expectation value whose energy density drives the acceleration . on smaller scales",
    ", this field would be responsible for a fifth force .",
    "however , a screening mechanism in massive bodies allows the model to evade all the local gravitational tests .",
    "chameleon models depend on the shape of the dark energy potential . in the following",
    "we will always assume that @xmath13 is a decreasing function .",
    "the coupling to matter @xmath7 is also crucial .",
    "chameleons have an effective potential which becomes matter density dependent @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the chameleon field and @xmath16 the non - relativistic matter density .",
    "as the potential @xmath13 decreases , the effective potential has always a matter dependent minimum .",
    "fluctuations around the vacuum expectation values at the minimum can be seen as chameleon particles which couple to matter .",
    "the best constraint on @xmath7 comes from the energy levels of neutrons in the terrestrial gravitational field and reads @xmath17@xcite .",
    "the density - dependent minimum is such that the mass of the scalar field becomes also density dependent .",
    "we will focus on inverse power law models defined by @xmath18 where we have neglected higher inverse powers of the chameleon field .",
    "these models describe chameleon properties with no loss of generality .",
    "moreover , although precise numerical results depend on @xmath6 , generic properties are mostly independent of @xmath6 . in the following",
    "we will focus on small values of @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 when we investigate chameleon resonances in the sun and later only @xmath20 for the back - conversion of chameleons in the photosphere , the corona and helioscopes .",
    "a more thorough scanning of the values of @xmath6 should be envisaged when comparing our results to experimental data in helioscopes .",
    "we will choose @xmath21 to accommodate the acceleration of expansion rate of the universe on large scales .",
    "the potential has a minimum located at @xmath22 where @xmath16 is the total non - relativistic matter density .",
    "the chameleon rest mass at the minimum is @xmath23 we will see that in a cylindrical pipe , this rest mass is only valid at large enough coupling to matter @xmath7 .",
    "chameleons also couple to photons in a way akin to the axion coupling @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the determinant of the metric @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the photon field strength .",
    "this implies that the effective matter density in the effective potential is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the magnetic field .",
    "for instance , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the contribution of a magnetic field @xmath33 t , like the one around the tachocline , to the energy density is approximately equivalent to @xmath34 , i.e. a negligible contribution to @xmath16 when @xmath35 .",
    "the chameleon parameter space depends on the discrete index @xmath6 and two continuous parameters @xmath36 , the coupling to matter , and @xmath37 the suppression scale of the coupling to photons .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the photon coupling parameter @xmath38 .",
    "we have already mentioned different experimental and observational bounds on the coupling parameters of chameleons . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", very few constraints apply to the parameter space of chameleons .",
    "the shape of the potential which we have parameterised using the index @xmath6 is not restricted .",
    "we will only invoke a naturality criterion and assume that @xmath6 is not a large number although we are not aware of any deep physical reason for this . when it comes to the coupling constants to matter and photons",
    ", we will simply impose that the couplings are greater than one , e.g. corresponding to a scale @xmath39 .",
    "again , this type of restriction is only due to the fact that chameleon theories must be viewed as effective field theories only valid below a scale which could be smallest value between @xmath40 and @xmath37 .",
    "of course , as the high energy description of chameleon theories valid up to very large scales , maybe the planck scale , is not known , we can not be too strict with this type of argument .",
    "on the other hand , when the chameleons are conformally coupled to matter fields , e.g. fermions , and that one studies the low energy physics obtained after integrating out the heavy fields , the coupling constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be related@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fine structure constant . in this case , their relationship depends on the total number of fermions @xmath43 , due to a conformal anomaly , and the number of heavy fermions @xmath44 .",
    "this would naturally lead to a hierarchy between @xmath45 when a large number of fermions is present . in practice and in the absence of knowledge about the number of fermions in the theory at high energy and whether chameleons are conformally coupled in this high energy regime , we have chosen to use @xmath7 and @xmath8 as independent parameters .",
    "chameleons can be produced during the propagation of photons inside the macroscopic magnetic fields of the sun .",
    "these chameleons would then escape from the sun and reach the earth , where they could be detected by helioscopes such as cast .",
    "indeed chameleons interact with matter with a coupling constant depending on the fermion mass and the combination @xmath46 .",
    "interactions are therefore stronger with protons than with electrons in the solar plasma .",
    "the interaction rate with a fermions can be estimated as @xmath47 taking the proton rate as the dominant part and using electroneutrality , we find that the mean free path @xmath48 reads @xmath49 where @xmath16 is the solar density and @xmath50 the proton mass .",
    "the mean free path is shorter in dense regions and reads @xmath51 which far exceeds the size of the sun .",
    "hence solar chameleons escape through the solar plasma unscathed .",
    "the only possible interaction of chameleons is with photons in a magnetised region .",
    "the mixing of photons and chameleons depends on @xmath52 where the effective mass is ( see ( [ mass ] ) ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the initial frequency of the incoming photons .",
    "this depends on the mixing angle which is given by @xmath55 and the plasma frequency which is @xmath56 where @xmath42 is the fine structure constant .",
    "for instance , when @xmath57 and @xmath32 , the magnetic contribution to the mass for @xmath58 t is @xmath59 times smaller than the plasma frequency .",
    "electro - neutrality implies that , in the sun , @xmath60 , where @xmath50 is the proton mass .",
    "when @xmath61 : as is the case in most helioscope pipes and also inside the sun , we have @xmath62 chameleon production in a magnetised region of size @xmath63 is obtained from the transition probability @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "for instance with @xmath66 and @xmath32 , the dependence of this conversion probability on the photon energy @xmath54 can be seen on figure 6 where typical values of order @xmath67 are obtained .     as a function of the matter coupling constant @xmath7 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "notice that only a limited range of @xmath7 can lead to a resonance in the sun .",
    "nuclear physics constraints always impose @xmath17@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   as a function of the matter coupling constant @xmath7 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "notice that only a limited range of @xmath7 can lead to a resonance in the sun .",
    "nuclear physics constraints always impose @xmath17@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]      it is important to notice that chameleon production is only possible when @xmath68 ( see ( [ k ] ) ) for small values of @xmath69 .",
    "we will find that for large values of @xmath7 , this condition is hard to meet in the sun . neglecting the magnetic contribution to the mass and @xmath32 ,",
    "the magnetic contribution to the energy density is @xmath70 times smaller than the matter density close to the tachocline and only around a few percent in the sparsest regions of the sun s atmosphere . ]",
    ", we have the following expression for the effective mass ( [ eff ] ) @xmath71 where we have introduced the density dependent frequency @xmath72 for large enough @xmath7 , the effective mass increases like @xmath73 .",
    "this implies that low energy chameleons are attenuated in the sun .",
    "chameleons only propagate when @xmath74 let us consider the case of chameleon production in a narrow magnetic region , say around the tachocline @xmath75 .",
    "as @xmath76 decreases with decreasing @xmath16 , once a chameleon of energy @xmath54 has been created , it can propagate all the way to the outer sun .",
    "denoting by @xmath77 the density in the production region and @xmath78 , a bound on the range of allowed couplings is @xmath79 for a given @xmath7 , we then see that energetic chameleons can always satisfy this bound while chameleons of lower energy are attenuated in the sun . on the other hand",
    "if we are interested in back - converted photons from chameleons in a magnetic helioscope with an energy range , e.g. @xmath80 , we find that chameleons can only be produced if @xmath7 is smaller than an upper bound @xmath81 .",
    "the value of @xmath81 depends on the density in the production region and the index @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath20 and a production around the tachocline , we find that @xmath82 for the propagation of chameleons in the detectable energy range @xmath83 .",
    "this is a very wide range of couplings which is compatible with the bound from the neutron energy levels in the terrestrial gravitational field .",
    "we will estimate the production of chameleons in magnetic regions in the sun .",
    "we will focus on a rather conservative assumption , where a constant magnetic field is present in a small shell around the tachocline about 0.7 @xmath11 ( the width of the tachocline is around @xmath84 with a magnetic field in the 20 - 50 t range ) . in this region , the production can be of two types .",
    "the first one is due to the presence of a resonance where the effective mass vanishes .",
    "this leads to the creation of chameleons over a narrow radial strip of extremely small width .",
    "the second type is the non - resonant production over the whole width of the magnetic region .",
    "once created , chameleons interact very little with matter and can only occasionally be back - converted to photons .",
    "if this happens deep inside the sun , this represents a tiny modification of the solar radiative transfer , but it can be safely neglected .",
    "if this chameleon to photon back - conversion takes place in the photosphere and above where the photon mean free path is large , the resulting back converted photons would escape from the sun and have a spectrum which could contribute to the sun s soft x - ray luminosity .",
    "interestingly , the sun s x - ray luminosity far exceeds the expected one for a black body at t= 5780 k. this excess radiation reflects the puzzling corona problem , first noticed in 1939@xcite .",
    "remarkably , the corona is indeed hotter above magnetised regions like sunspots .",
    "chameleons leaving the sun arrive unhindered in the earth s atmosphere where they penetrate due to their high energy .",
    "they also go through matter and can be back converted into photons in magnetic helioscopes . we will describe the production mechanisms in the next section .",
    "let us consider the resonant case when the effective mass ( [ eff ] ) vanishes somewhere inside the sun@xcite .",
    "notice that the actual rest mass of the chameleon does not vanish at the resonance .",
    "of course , such a resonant effect is only of interest for this work if it occurs in a magnetised region of the sun . neglecting as always the magnetic contribution to the mass we have @xmath85 where we have introduced @xmath86 the resonance happens in the sun when @xmath87 .",
    "this depends on @xmath7 and @xmath6 . at the resonance we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    in the vicinity of the resonance ,",

    "notice the parabolic shape at low energy followed by a sinusoidal trend which would saturate at much higher energies ( not shown here ) . ]      before leaving the sun , a tiny fraction of the produced chameleons can be back - converted into photons while propagating through the magnetised photosphere and the other layers of the solar atmosphere .",
    "we will be interested in three types of conversion processes .",
    "the first one would happen in the photosphere below the solar surface .",
    "inside the sun , the mean free path of photons is the maximal extension over which a back - conversion can occur .",
    "indeed , on larger distances , photons are scattered and can not mix with the incoming chameleonic wave function . in the photosphere ,",
    "the magnetic field is of order 0.2 t. above the solar surface , we envisage two situations .",
    "the first one corresponds to the quiet sun with a small magnetic field of order 1 gauss distributed over large regions satisfying the empirical law@xcite @xmath189 we also consider flares where the magnetic fields are much larger while the size of the magnetic regions is smaller although still following the same empirical law ( [ emp ] ) .",
    "the number of back - converted photons is given by @xmath190 when the coherence length ( in the photosphere ) is much larger than the size of the magnetic region .",
    "in the photosphere where the density is relatively high compared to the atmosphere , the coherence length is relatively short and one must average out over the distribution of photon excursions between two scatterings .",
    "this implies , using ( [ prob ] ) and the averaged value @xmath191 , that the number of back - converted photons is @xmath192 where @xmath193 is reduced by the larger effective mass in denser regions , such as inside the photosphere compared to the corona .",
    "indeed , we find that the back - conversion of outstreaming chameleons from the inner sun is largely suppressed in the photosphere where the density is higher than in the upper atmosphere with a much smaller plasma density . as a result",
    "we find that the back - conversion of photons from outstreaming chameleons is mainly taking place in magnetised regions above the chromosphere .",
    "as the back - converted photons have a spectrum in the soft x - ray band , this leads to an excess of solar x - ray luminosity given by @xmath194 it is shown below that this radiation excess is tiny compared to the total solar luminosity .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    it is therefore relevant to give an order of magnitude estimate of the predicted x - ray intensity from back - converted solar chameleons and compare it with observation . since the chameleon effective mass is low in sparse regions , it decreases outside the sun when chameleons propagate in empty space",
    ". moreover the coherence length @xmath136 increases with @xmath196 and the conversion probability with @xmath197 . in the weak but extended magnetic fields",
    "@xmath198 which is present all the way to the vicinity of the earth and in particular the orbiting x - ray observatories , the chameleon - to - photon conversion is possible . as an illustration , in figure 6 we see that the chameleon - to - photon conversion efficiency is greater than @xmath199 10@xmath200 in a cast - like pipe for bl=90 tm . the estimated integral of the inter planetary magnetic field @xmath201 is about @xmath202 to @xmath203tm and occasionally even larger @xcite .",
    "the conversion probability becomes then 100 times to @xmath204 times larger than the one estimated for a cast - like magnet in vacuum ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "taking into account that the maximal allowed solar luminosity in any invisible channel is about 10% of the total solar luminosity , then , a rather conservative estimate of the expected excess x - ray observation at 1 au , is about @xmath205 to @xmath206erg / s .",
    "surprisingly , this fits observations ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .    how could the chameleon origin of this excess be established observationally in a non - equivocal manner ?",
    "in fact , the following two measurements can be performed : 1 ) the measurement of the solar x - ray ray spectrum in the energy range below @xmath207 2 kev , which has been done in the recent solar minimum @xcite , and 2 ) the two dimensional reconstruction of the quiet sun x - ray spectrum in the same energy range .",
    "if the tachocline were the source of the outstreaming chameleons which would back - convert to soft x - rays on their journey to earth through the magnetic field ( only its transverse component matters ) , the derived two dimensional plot would have a characteristic ring - like structure at about 0.7@xmath208 .",
    "this would be a clear signature of the creation of chameleons or other similar exotica around the tachocline .",
    "further studies , following the suggestions of this work , would allow to localize the involved processes . moreover ,",
    "once reconstructed , this would provide a new tool for investigating the solar plasma , either in the interplanetary space or deep inside the sun , i.e. near the tachocline some 200000 km deep inside the sun .",
    "this would have the potential to become , along with the solar neutrinos and helioseismology , one of the most precise methods to obtain information from the otherwise perfectly shielded inner sun .    of course ,",
    "laboratory measurements as suggested here ( see section iv ) , or , observations with a magnetic helioscope like cast would provide complimentary information .",
    "in fact , cast can increase its sensitivity to solar chameleons by a factor of 10 - 100 in solar chameleon signature , once its detectors can perform with a lower energy threshold , i.e. towards a few 100 ev s ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "so far we have presented mechanisms for the creation of chameleons in the sun by the primakoff effect and their back conversion at the surface of the magnetised sun or in magnetic helioscopes by the inverse primakoff effect . of",
    "course these results depend on the choice of the solar model for the magnetic region where chameleons are produced",
    ". it would be extremely important to have a model - independent probe of the existence of chameleons in the x - ray domain .",
    "this would also complement the chase experiment which has been carried out in the ev energy range and might suffer from uncertainties related to multiple reflections of chameleons at the beamtube walls .",
    "we suggest an experiment where a powerful source of x - rays shines through a , say , cast - like magnetic pipe , while another identical pipe lies downstream on the other side of a x - ray absorbing thick barrier . of course",
    ", on the other side of the barrier no photons should appear conventionally .",
    "now the possibility of creating energetic chameleons in the first magnet which would go downstream through the thick barrier allows the regeneration of photons on the other side of the barrier , that by the time - reversed process .",
    "we consider that both magnetic pipes on each side are identical . in practice",
    "we can have @xmath209 at most so far .",
    "the spectrum of regenerated photons is @xmath210 where @xmath211 in the helioscope pipe .",
    "we have taken the source spectrum to be @xmath212 such that @xmath213 and @xmath164 is the aperture of the pipe . upon integration",
    "this spectrum , we obtain the total number of photons per second @xmath214 when this number is higher or at least not much smaller than the background level noise of the detectors in the appropriate energy range , this gives a new way of searching for chameleons , independently of any astrophysical modeling .",
    "of course axions with a similar mass and photon coupling as chameleons would also go through the dense barrier and regenerate x - rays with a resulting spectrum very similar to the chameleonic case .",
    "so how can one distinguish chameleons from axions ?",
    "in fact , one can use one of the fundamental properties of chameleons : the dependence of their mass on the density in the pipe , while qcd - inspired axions have a fixed rest mass .",
    "indeed as we have already exemplified in figure 8 , when the density of the gas filling the pipe is increased , the effective mass of the chameleons becomes also larger and the conversion probability oscillates and is suppressed by @xmath215 , hence a quartic signal suppression in the chameleon through wall experiment . as a result ,",
    "for a high enough pressure , the number of regenerated photons would become essentially zero .",
    "this is a distinguishing property of chameleons .",
    "indeed , one could envisage to perform the experiment in vacuum and then with an optically transparent gas in the pipe at a relatively high pressure , exploiting the different dependencies of the chameleon and alp production on the gas pressure in the beam pipe .",
    "in fact , a cast pressure of @xmath216 1 mbar is transparent to x - rays and should sufficient to realise the identification of chameleons .",
    "a similar technique will be applied for the detection of the chameleon force between metallic plates : by comparing the force in vacuum and with a dense material between the plates , one may detect the presence of chameleons . here the same type of technique may give a direct indication of the existence of chameleons in the kev energy range .",
    "for a given @xmath6 , the resonance inside the sun depends on @xmath7 . we find that values of @xmath7 which lead to a resonance are quite limited . outside this small interval ,",
    "no resonance is present . in figure 1 , we have plotted the density at the resonance and in figure 2 the solar radius of the resonance as a function of @xmath7 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "typically the resonance exists for @xmath217 for @xmath20 . for large values , @xmath218",

    "larger values of @xmath7 are already excluded by nuclear physics measurements of the neutron energy levels in the terrestrial gravitational field@xcite .",
    "different values of @xmath6 give almost the same type of results .",
    "when it comes to the back - conversion of the emitted chameleons in a helioscope , we concentrate on cast - like conditions .",
    "we take into account 100 hours of observation with a detection noise of 1 photons per hour in the 1 - 7 kev range when the vacuum in the pipe is such that the pressure is about @xmath220 mbar .",
    "we have taken the pipe length to be 9.26 m , the magnetic field 9  t and the diameter of the pipe to be 43   mm . in the sun , we have considered a constant magnetic field of 30 t above the tachocline in a shell of width @xmath118 . in this case , the width of the resonance as a function of @xmath7 is given in fig .",
    "it is of the same order of magnitude as the thermal photon mean free path in the tachocline , i.e. around 0.3 cm .",
    "when observations are carried out during h hours , the signal to noise ratio is @xmath221 where the noise level of the helioscope is taken to be @xmath222 per hour as a generic example .",
    "we have given in fig.4 a sensitivity plot at the 2@xmath9 level for a 100 hour measurement in vacuum .",
    "as can be seen , for values of @xmath7 below the resonance range , the sensitivity region is uniform and the matter coupling must be @xmath223 which is to be compared with the chase bound @xmath224 . outside the resonance values , the coherence length in the sun decreases rapidly and the production probability oscillates very fast leading to a diminishing sensitivity .",
    "we note that inside a helioscope pipe in vacuum , the rest mass of the chameleon is determined by the radius @xmath225 of the pipe and is density independent@xcite @xmath226 this is valid at low values of @xmath7 . for higher values ,",

    "an upgraded version with a spectrum of @xmath249 could be assumed for a future dedicated beam line .",
    "we will quote results obtained with this flux .",
    "the detection of a low flux of regenerated photon depends also on the detector sensitivity .",
    "we will assume in this work @xmath250 . with these specifications",
    ", we estimate the 2@xmath9 detection efficiency . for that",
    ", we refer to the case @xmath31 and @xmath251 as fixed by the solar energy loss bound .",
    "the original source spectrum and the regenerated photons are presented in figure 13 with @xmath252 .",
    "the number of seconds for a n@xmath9 detection is @xmath253 we find that a 2@xmath9 level signal would take 300 days .",
    "an increase of the number of photons originating from the source by one or two orders of magnitude would reduce this number to a few days only .",
    "however , if three equivalent cast magnetic pipes ( e.g two lhc bending magnets on each side of the barrier ) were used on both sides of the thick barrier , a 5@xmath9 level would take only 6 days , which is an experimental challenge for a chameleon smoking gun .",
    "a distinguishing feature of chameleons is the fact that there would be no signal on top of the detection noise when the pipe is filled with a gas at relatively high pressure .",
    "a comparison between the vacuum and pressured cases inside the magnetic pipes up to a few mbar only may help to identify the regenerated photon signal in a much better fashion .",
    "we have studied the creation of chameleons inside the sun by the primakoff effect and their back - conversion to soft x - ray photons in the magnetised photosphere , the corona and helioscopes on earth by the inverse primakoff effect .",
    "the production of chameleons is strongly dependent on the assumed features of the magnetised regions inside the sun .",
    "depending on the magnetic field in the sun and the size of the magnetised zone , it is possible to deduce the energy loss of the sun escaping as chameleons and impose the energy loss bound : no more than 10 % of the total solar luminosity can be carried away by unknown species . provided this bound is satisfied , escaping chameleons reach the surface of the earth and may be back - converted into soft x - ray photons in the pipe of a magnetic helioscope .",
    "moreover , a tiny fraction of the escaping chameleons could also be converted into photons inside the photosphere or the corona .",
    "we have found that for a rather conservative solar model with a widely accepted magnetised region of size @xmath118 around the tachocline , the non - resonant production of chameleons would lead to a 2@xmath9 detection of x - rays in a cast - like helioscope and an energy loss of the sun due to chameleons just below 10% .",
    "however , using detectors sensitive to sub - kev photons , this would enormousy improve the detection significance .    for the same chameleon parameters , we have proposed a shining through wall experiment where chameleons produced in one or more cast - like pipes from a powerful x - ray source would go through a thick barrier and regenerate into x - rays downstream of the barrier in a second magnetic field .",
    "the observation of this phenomenon would be a chameleon smoking gun with clear possible chameleon identification .",
    "in summary we have shown that a viable candidate for dark energy , the chameleon , could be sought for in magnetic helioscopes and purely laboratory based experiments .",
    "both approaches could be pursued in the near future .",
    "the combination of their results could give new insights into yet unexplained phenomena .",
    "we have also seen that chameleons could shed new light on the solar corona problem .",
    "of course , nothing guarantees that the coupling of chameleons to photons is large enough to lead to a detection of chameleons .",
    "if no signal were obtained , new bounds on this coupling would ensue corresponding to higher and higher limits on the suppression scale of the coupling of photons to a scalar field .       as a function of the photon energy in kev ( left ) and the regenerated spectrum on the other side of the barrier ( right ) .",

    "<S> dark energy models , such as the chameleon , where the acceleration of the expansion of the universe results from the dynamics of a scalar field coupled to matter , suffer from the potential existence of a fifth force . </S>",
    "<S> three known mechanisms have been proposed to restore general relativity in the solar system and the laboratory , which are the symmetron / damour - polyakov effect , the vainshtein property and the chameleon screening . here , we propose to probe the existence of chameleons in the laboratory , considering their particle physics consequences . </S>",
    "<S> we envisage the resonant and non - resonant production of chameleons in the sun and their back - conversion into x - ray photons in a solar helioscope pipe such as the one used by cast . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the resonant contribution is only present for a very small range of chameleon couplings to matter and occurs in extremely narrow magnetised regions in the sun . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the non - resonant case , chameleons are created in all available solar magnetic regions and for a very wide range of chameleon couplings to photons and matter . </S>",
    "<S> such chameleons could leave the sun and be back - converted into x - ray photons above the photosphere or in the magnetic pipe of a helioscope . </S>",
    "<S> a detection of these x - rays would indicate the existence of chameleons . </S>",
    "<S> the number of produced chameleons and regenerated x - ray photons varies depending on the strength of the solar magnetic field in the production shell , the matter and photon couplings of chameleons , and the magnetic field length and magnitude inside a dipole magnet . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a template model for the solar magnetic field : a constant magnetic field in a narrow shell surrounding the tachocline . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray photons in a helioscope pipe obtained from back - conversion of the chameleons created inside the sun have a spectrum which is peaked in the sub - kev region , just below the actual sensitivity range of the present axion helioscopes . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless they are detectable by present day magnetic helioscopes like cast and sumico , which were built originally for solar axions . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a chameleon - through - a - wall experiment whereby x - ray photons from a synchroton radiation source could be converted into chameleons inside a dipole magnet , then pass a wall which is opaque to x - rays before being back - converted into x - ray photons in a second magnet downstream . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this could provide a direct signature for the existence of chameleon particles . </S>"
