    "quasar absorption line systems , as traced by their , provide a unique way to study our universe .",
    "current classifications schemes for systems with detected file them into three main categories : those that are characterized by their strong absorption , those that reveal weak , narrow , single  cloud profiles , and those that exhibit weak , multiple cloud absorption . in this paper",
    "we analyze in detail the absorption profiles from a particular multiple cloud weak absorber at @xmath10 along the line of sight toward pg  @xmath1 .",
    "the longer  term goal of a collection of similar studies will be to understand the relationships between the different classes of absorption systems , and the connections with the different types of galaxies and structures at various redshifts .",
    "although there are no distinct divisions between the three categories of absorption systems , by their properties they appear to be related to three different types of gaseous structures at @xmath11 .",
    "strong absorbers [ those with @xmath12   ] show lyman limit breaks and contain multiple clouds spread over tens to hundreds of kilometers per second @xcite .",
    "a large majority of these absorbers are known to be associated with luminous galaxies ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the schechter luminosity ) , within an impact parameter of @xmath15  kpc of the quasar @xcite .",
    "all of the strong absorbers ( @xmath16 at @xmath17 @xcite ) can be accounted for by regions of this size around the known population of luminous galaxies .",
    "the strong absorber spectral profiles , in chemical transitions of low and high ionization states , generally require multiple phases of gas , i.e. regions of differing densities that are spatially distinct ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the kinematics of the low ionization gas is generally consistent with what one would expect from the combined disks and halos of galaxies of a variety of morphological types @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the strong absorbers , the single  component systems with weaker ( rest frame equivalent widths @xmath18   ) are typically not known to be directly associated with luminous galaxies ( i.e. they are not within @xmath19@xmath20  kpc of @xmath21 galaxies ) @xcite . these single  component weak systems have a significant absorption cross - section , with @xmath22 for @xmath23   at @xmath24 @xcite , similar to the value for all strong absorbers . the distribution of the number of voigt profile components used to fit absorption systems is roughly gaussian with a median of seven components .",
    "however , there is a strong excess of single cloud components relative to the rest of the distribution ( see fig .  2 in @xcite and table 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the single  component weak absorbers are primarily produced by a different class of object than the strong absorbers .",
    "consistent with this interpretation , most of the single  component weak absorbers do not produce lyman limit breaks @xcite .",
    "their profiles are generally quite narrow , with doppler parameters of @xmath25 ",
    "@xmath26  .",
    "their profiles are broader and require a separate , higher ionization , phase of gas .",
    "their low ionization phases are inferred to have metallicities greater than a tenth solar and to have sizes less than @xmath27@xmath20  pc @xcite .",
    "the general properties of the single  cloud weak absorbers suggest an origin in some type of faded early extragalactic star cluster or in metal  rich fragments in cold dark matter mini",
    " halos  failed galaxies  @xcite",
    ".    the third category of systems is characterized by multiple , weak components spread over tens of kilometers per second .",
    "about one third of the weak absorbers are in this category @xcite . by definition , these are `` weak absorbers '' , since the total rest frame equivalent width of  2796 is @xmath28   . unlike the the strong absorbers , little is directly known about the environments of the multiple  component weak systems .",
    "however , the multiple  component weak category appears consistent with an extension of the distribution of the numbers of components fit to strong absorbers ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the weakness and kinematics of the multiple  component weak profiles might suggest a line of sight through the outer regions of a galaxy where the gas could be more diffuse and less dense .",
    "it is also possible that a dwarf galaxy , or even a low  metallicity giant galaxy would give rise to such weak absorption .    in this paper",
    ", we study a multiple  component , weak [ rest frame equivalent width , @xmath29   ] absorber at @xmath11 .",
    "this absorber was modeled previously by @xcite , using low ",
    "resolution fos / hst data along with the high  resolution profiles from hires / keck .",
    "they determined that the clouds have a relatively low metallicity of @xmath30 solar , based on a comparison to a partial lyman limit break .",
    "the , detected in the fos spectrum , was clearly offset from the low ionization clouds .",
    "this required an additional high ionization cloud producing absorption @xmath31   to the blue of the detected clouds .",
    "@xcite predicted that this cloud should produce observable , , and in the high resolution stis spectrum .",
    "however , with just the low  resolution uv spectrum , they were unable to determine if the detected at the same velocity as could arise in the same phase of gas with the , or if a separate phase would be needed .",
    "also , the ionization conditions and metallicities of the high ionization clouds could not be well  constrained .",
    "stis / hst spectra of pg  @xmath1 are now available , with high resolution coverage of and the lyman series , , , , , and . with these new data ,",
    "we aim to test the models of @xcite , and to reach more detailed conclusions about the phase structure , metallicity , ionization conditions and kinematic properties of the @xmath10 system toward pg  @xmath1 .    in   [ sec :",

    "spectra of the @xmath32 quasar pg  @xmath1 , obtained with the three instruments hires / keck , stis / hst , and fos / hst , were used to study the various transitions from an intervening absorber at @xmath33 .",
    "other systems along this line of sight are published elsewhere .",
    "there are three weak , single  cloud absorbers at @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite and a strong absorber at @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "although a wfpc2/hst image of the quasar field exists , it is not deep , so it provides only a limited constraint on the luminosity of the host galaxy of this @xmath10 absorber .",
    "after subtraction of the point spread function of the @xmath38 quasar from the image , @xcite did not detect any galaxies within the @xmath39 planetary camera field of view to a magnitude of @xmath40 ( at the @xmath41 level ) .",
    "this implies that there are no galaxies brighter than @xmath42 with impact parameter less than @xmath43  kpc at the redshift of our absorber ( @xcite used @xmath44 ) . due to uncertainties in the psf",
    "the limit is not as restrictive within @xmath45 kpc .",

    "the optical depth is @xmath90 , using the method of @xcite , which implies @xmath91 .",
    "we derive constraints on the kinematic , chemical , and ionization conditions of the absorbing gas .",
    "our method is to compare the absorption profiles of the observed chemical transitions ( presented in figures  @xmath79 and @xmath92 ) with those predicted by photoionization and collisional ionization models .",
    "we summarize the method here , and it is also described and applied in our earlier papers @xcite .    for photoionization , we use the code cloudy @xcite and adopt the extragalactic background spectrum of @xcite for the ultraviolet ionizing flux .",
    "we use the spectrum normalized at @xmath93 .",
    "we have also considered the influence of stellar ionizing flux , which we describe below in   [ sec : stellar ] . for collisional ionization ,",
    "we adopt the equilibrium models of @xcite , which provide the column densities of various transitions for assumed temperatures and metallicities .    for photoionization",
    ", each cloud is modeled as a constant density plane - parallel slab with the ionizing flux incident on one face .",
    "we assume a solar abundance pattern , however , deviations from this pattern are considered when suggested by the data .",
    "the ionization conditions are defined by the ionization parameter , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , the ratio of the number density of hydrogen ionizing photons to the number density of hydrogen .",
    "the quantity @xmath96 is fixed by the normalization of the extragalactic background spectrum , so that the relationship between @xmath94 and @xmath97 is @xmath98 .",
    "since the abundance pattern and ionization parameter are interdependent , the models are not unique .",
    "we have found that the absorption lines can not be modeled as a single ionization `` phase . '' in this context , phases denote regions or `` clouds '' with similar ionization parameter , density , metallicity , and temperature . for simplicity , clouds in the same phase are assumed to have the same metallicity .",
    "moreover , we consider physical scenarios that require a minimum number of phases to explain the data .",
    "the lower ionization transitions in the @xmath10 absorber reveal clear kinematic structure and we therefore use them as a template to place constraints on the phase structure of the system . in order to obtain the best initial estimates for the cloud properties , we begin with the lowest ionization transition that is most clearly detected and resolved in each of the subsystems .",
    "we obtain the column densities and doppler @xmath99 parameters for this transition using voigt profile ( vp ) fits . in subsystem",
    "a , we adopt the column densities and doppler parameters for the doublet from @xcite as stated above . in subsystem b ,",
    "@xmath100 is not covered by keck and so we fitted the  @xmath75 profile .",
    "vp profile fits are dependent on spectral resolution .",
    "although they do not provide a unique description of the physical conditions of the gas , we can still use them to identify a plausible range of parameter space .",
    "the data are of lower resolution than the data . compared to the",
    ", the fits to the grouping will in general likely yield fewer clouds , which will have larger @xmath99 parameters and smaller column densities , and this is likely to be a bias rather than a real , physical effect .",
    "we use the optimization mode of cloudy . for each cloud , we `` optimize '' on the vp column density of a selected transition , for an assumed ionization parameter and metallicity .",
    "cloudy then calculates the column densities for all other ionization species and determines the kinetic temperature .",
    "this temperature is used to calculate the thermal component of the @xmath99 parameter for the optimized transition .",
    "this thermal @xmath99 is then compared to the vp @xmath99 parameter to calculate the turbulent component assuming gaussian turbulence .",
    "doppler parameters for all other transitions are then computed using this turbulent component and scaling for ion mass .    to compare the cloudy model predictions to the observations , we generate synthetic spectra based upon the cloudy column densities and derived @xmath99 parameters .",
    "the synthetic spectra are convolved with the appropriate instrumental profile , and are assigned the same pixel sampling as the instrument with which a given transition was observed . for hires and fos , we used gaussians with fwhm@xmath101   and @xmath89  , respectively .",
    "for stis , the instrumental spread function for the e230 m grating was taken from the stis performance web pages at _",
    "www.stsci.edu_.    the ionization parameters and metallicities of cloudy models are then iteratively adjusted in order to minimize deviations between the observed and synthetic spectra .",
    "although we considered a strict @xmath102 criterion for optimization , we found this to be unrealistic given the tendency for one or two pixels to have a dominant contribution to that statistic .",
    "visual inspection , comparing the model profiles to the data , generally yield ionization parameters and metallicities accurate to @xmath103@xmath59 dex .    the ionization conditions are determined by examining the relative absorption strengths of the different metal transitions . for the optically thin regime ,",
    "the entire cloud is subject to the same ionizing spectrum ( there is no ionization structure ) and thus @xmath94 can be determined from two metal transitions independent of metallicity .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cloudyill ] , which shows two grids of cloudy models with different metallicities , @xmath104  solar and solar . to construct the grids ,",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density was fixed at @xmath105 , and the ionization parameter was varied from @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "the figure shows that the ratio of the column densities of various transitions , at a given @xmath94 , does not depend on the metallicity . for the allowed range of @xmath94 , metallicity",
    "is then constrained by the partial lyman limit break and the transition .    in this paper",
    ", we have assumed a solar abundance for the optimized transition .",
    "however , it is straightforward to consider how the metallicity derived would differ if we assumed a different abundance .",
    "if the optimized transition has an abundance of @xmath108  dex relative to solar , then a model with a metallicity of @xmath109 would be correct .",
    "of course , the abundances of other elements would have to be adjusted relative to the optimized transition based on whatever abundance pattern was assumed .",
    "we present constraints on the gross properties of the @xmath33 absorber along the line of sight to pg  @xmath1 .",
    "we do not attempt to find a unique model to describe the data , however we consider what general conclusions can be drawn about the kinematics and multi - phase ionization structure of the absorbing gas .",
    "we present examples of plausible models of the column densities , doppler parameters , ionization parameters , and metallicities in tables @xmath92 and @xmath3 .",
    "we constrained the range of ionization parameters for subsystems a and b using detected metal transitions and limits . for subsystem",
    "a , we consider two models : one in which the and arise in the same phase ( model 1 ) , and the other in which they arise in different phases ( model 2 ) .",
    "the vp fits yield four clouds with column densities ranging from @xmath110 to @xmath111 and @xmath112 parameters from @xmath3 to @xmath113   ( see table @xmath92 ) . in model 1 we assume that the and arise in the same phase . to fully account for the absorption the four clouds would have @xmath94 values of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath114 , and @xmath114 , respectively .",

    "[ sec : system ] ) is apparent in the  @xmath117 panel as well as in the expanded data in figure  [ fig : offset ] .",
    "this leads us to consider an alternative model , in which the and are produced by separate , kinematically offset clouds .      in model 2",
    "we assume that the absorption for subsystem a is produced entirely in a phase separate from the .",
    "we again choose as the optimized transition for the lower ionization `` clouds '' , and use the vp fits to the as the starting point for our model .",

    "the presence of an additional high ionization component is convincingly confirmed by the presence of absorption at a consistent velocity .",
    "it seems likely that the seen in the fos spectrum and the seen in the stis spectrum would arise in the same phase .    because of the limitations of the low resolution data , the @xcite work was unable to distinguish between two scenarios for the origin of the in the redward part of the profile .",

    "this suggests that the subsystems arise in a smaller region internal to a galaxy or structure , more likely to be close to the stellar sources of metals .",

    "the very strongest absorbers ( which are common only at @xmath249 ) , could also have an origin in superwinds @xcite .",
    "these absorbers have a characteristic saturated `` double  trough '' absorption profile in , which breaks up into multiple clouds in other weaker low - ionization transitions . as with our two subsystems ,",
    "the saturated troughs are typically separated by @xmath157@xmath243  .",
    "strong low - ionization absorption could arise from clouds close to the point of origin of the wind or from early evolutionary stages of the superwind phenomenon .",
    "as we reach larger distances or later stages when low  ionization superwind clouds may have fragmented or dispersed , we might expect weaker absorption profiles like the ones we are seeing in the @xmath10 absorber toward pg  @xmath1 .",
    "if more multiple cloud , weak absorbers with two subsystems are observed it should be possible to test between an origin in two structures and an origin in a wind or outflow . if winds are responsible then we would expect to see broad , high ionization absorption to the blue of the blueward subsystem and to the red of the redward subsystem .",
    "if two separate structures were responsible , the offset low and high ionization components would be due to kinematic differences between two components in such structures .",
    "in such a case , the broad , high ionization absorption should arise at random to the red or to the blue of each of the subsystems , and sometimes would even be superimposed .",
    "_ there are about two thirds as many multiple cloud weak absorbers as there are strong absorbers _ there must be a set of structures responsible for multiple cloud weak absorption with a cross section comparable to the set of @xmath69  kpc regions around all @xmath14 galaxies .",
    "if these are outer disks around all @xmath250 galaxies , an annulus with thickness of @xmath27  kpc would be required .",
    "@xcite found that it was plausible for the expected number of superwinds at redshift @xmath251 to account for the observed number of saturated `` double  trough '' strong profiles .",
    "similarly , we speculate whether the outer winds of a plausible number of bursting dwarfs could account for the observed number of multiple - cloud weak absorbers .",
    "there are about 2/3 as many multiple cloud weak absorbers are there are strong absorbers @xcite .",
    "strong absorption arises from regions around @xmath13 galaxies with sizes of @xmath252  kpc @xcite .",
    "if the regions around starbursting dwarfs that give rise to multi - cloud weak absorption have sizes of @xmath253  kpc , then a number density @xmath133 times that of @xmath254 galaxies could account for all these multi - cloud weak absorbers .",
    "realistically , it seems likely that there would be contributions to multiple cloud weak absorption from a variety of types of structures and processes .",
    "conversely , all types of structures that contain gas must all make some contribution to the absorber population , contributing either strong or weak absorption and/or contributing to or absorption .",
    "it is fairly well understood that @xmath14 galaxies produce most all of the observed strong absorption at @xmath11 .",
    "but it is not well understood what type of absorption systems quiescent dwarf galaxies or dwarf galaxies with winds would produce .",
    "above , we have considered the various properties of the @xmath10 absorber and discussed what types of structures and processes might be consistent .",
    "clearly , there is no unique interpretation .",
    "however , a model in which this absorber is related to dwarf galaxy winds is consistent with most of the listed properties .",
    "it can explain the phase structure of the absorber , the relative metallicities of the phases , and the kinematics of the two subsystems relative to the broad , higher ionization components .",
    "this model is also appealing in that it accounts for some of the absorption cross section presented by starbursting dwarfs , which were common at redshift one .",
    "many more multiple cloud , weak absorbers must be studied in order to evaluate the relative contributions of dwarf galaxy winds , of quiescent dwarf galaxies , of outer galaxy disks , and of other phenomena . in conjunction with such a statistical study",
    ", it will be essential to find analogs in the local universe so that the host galaxies and responsible processes can be directly identified .",
