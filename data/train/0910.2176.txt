    "the production mechanism of w / z bosons at the lhc is well known .",
    "higher order predictions of many w / z observables have been carried out .",

    "the compact muon solenoid  ( cms ) experiment is a 4@xmath3 general - purpose hadron - collider detector , which is suitable for high-@xmath4 physics studies at the lhc .",
    "the central feature of the compact muon solenoid apparatus is a superconducting solenoid , of 6  m internal diameter , providing a field of 3.8  t. within the field volume are the silicon pixel and strip tracker , the crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) and the brass / scintillator hadronic calorimeter ( hcal ) .",
