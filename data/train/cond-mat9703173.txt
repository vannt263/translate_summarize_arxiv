    "the aim of the present paper is to discuss the nature of the quadrupolar ordering in ceb@xmath0 .",
    "this compound is classified as a dense kondo system . with decreasing temperature",
    ", the resistivity grows logarithmically , attaining its maximum at @xmath2 k @xcite .",
    "the kondo temperature was initially estimated as @xmath3 k @xcite .",
    "later this value was significantly revised to a value of @xmath4 k from the experimental data on the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature @xcite .",
    "this revision was caused by an unusual picture of the crystal field splitting , revealed in the raman and neutron spectroscopic measurements @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the crystalline electric field ( cef ) of cubic symmetry ( the elementary cell , containing the ce ion with its boron environment , is shown in fig .",
    "1 ) results in splitting of the ce@xmath5 multiplet ( @xmath6 ) into a @xmath7 doublet and a @xmath8 quartet .",
    "the ground state of ce@xmath5 in ceb@xmath0 is realized as the well isolated @xmath8 quartet , and the @xmath9 cef gap has been determined as 47 mev @xcite . prior to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite many difficulties in interpretation of experimental data had arisen in connection with incorrect assumptions on the multiplet splitting : the ground state level had generally been ascribed to @xmath7 ( cf .",
    ", however , @xcite ) .",
    "the quadrupolar and magnetic transitions were proved in the specific heat measurements @xcite , nmr @xcite and neutron diffraction @xcite studies .",
    "since the typical ordering temperatures ( quadrupolar , @xmath10 k , and magnetic , @xmath11 k ) are much smaller than the cef splitting , for low energy phenomena with @xmath12 not exceeding several tens kelvin , it should be legitimate to neglect a @xmath7 contribution and to deal with @xmath8 only . the quadrupolar ordering",
    "is characterized by the following features :    * there are two lines in the @xmath13 phase diagram , which separate the anti - ferro - quadrupolar ( afq ) phase from the complex antiferro - magnetic ( afm ) phases ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and from the disordered ( d ) phase . the afq - d transition line , @xmath1 , exhibits a highly anisotropic behavior .",
    "starting at @xmath10 k , @xmath14 increases with @xmath15 at not very high magnetic field , and increases linearly , @xmath16 the re - entrant behavior of @xmath1 , predicted theoretically in @xcite , has not yet been confirmed experimentally up to magnetic field of 18 tesla @xcite ( for recent experimental data , see fig .",
    "it is worth noting , that the estimates from _ below _ for the values of the critical field at the re - entrance and @xmath17 are 18 tesla and 60 tesla , respectively , according to ref .",
    "* there are contradictory afq patterns obtained in different microscopic measurements : neutron @xcite , nmr @xcite and @xmath18sr @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of neutron experiments is consistent with the afq patterns of the @xmath19 $ ] modulation , whereas the nmr and @xmath18sr measurements display more complicated afq structures .",
    "note , that until now the above - mentioned microscopic methods , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath20b  nmr , neutron diffraction , as well as @xmath18sr , are used in non - zero magnetic fields which generate magnetically ordered states . indeed , picking up an identical modulation with the afq state , a magnetic ordering",
    "is a secondary effect with respect to the primary quadrupolar ordering . the theoretical approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite selects the @xmath21$]structure as energetically preferential . *",
    "the specific heat jump at @xmath14 appears to be of order of magnitude smaller than its counterpart at @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "this points out an important role of fluctuations at the d  afq transition .",
    "this circumstance has been taken into account in @xcite by employing the spherical model description of the effective spin hamiltonian .",
    "the specific heat jump on the d ",
    "afq transition line grows with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the main features of the magnetic ordering have been presented in @xcite :    * with a magnetic field applied along @xmath24 $ ] , the afm - structure is characterized by the wave - vector , either @xmath25 $ ] or @xmath26 $ ] ( the single-*k * structure at sufficiently high magnetic field ) , by a couple of @xmath27 s , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( the doublle-*k * structure in moderate fields ) , and by a mixture of differently oriented domains at weak magnetic fields ( see fig .",
    "2 , where all these magnetic phases are sketched out ) . *",
    "the bragg peaks at the wave - vectors @xmath28 and/or @xmath29 are accompanied by @xmath30 $ ] and/or @xmath31 $ ] , respectively @xcite .",
    "their occurrence is a sign of a crucial role of the afq modulation , @xmath32 $ ] , in the formation of magnetic structures .",
    "a possible double-*k * structure , identified in @xcite , is shown in fig .",
    "4 .    in the next section an effective `` separation '' of spin and orbital degrees of freedom",
    "is carried out by introducing a formalism , according to which magnetic and quadrupolar moments can be properly described by means of two pauli matrices , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "section iii concerns the analysis of the afq ground state and relevant excitations . in section iv ,",
    "on the basis of the two relevant interactions , zeeman and quadrupolar , and using the spherical model for picking up these interactions , we are able to determine the shape of @xmath1 .",
    "it occurs to be strongly anisotropic in the @xmath13 plane . despite a perfect cubic lattice symmetry , such a strong anisotropy is due to a spacial anisotropy of the quadrupolar interaction .",
    "its conventional form , following from the coulomb s interaction , gives rise to a very soft mode of @xmath35-excitations in the particular case of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "experimentally , strong fluctuations are indicated by a small specific heat jump at the d - afq transition .",
    "this is a reason for employing the spherical model which is an appropriate tool for describing systems with developed fluctuations .",
    "the spherical model is applied for deriving analytical formulae for the specific heat near the afq - d transition .",
    "we also outline how the magnetically ordered state can be generated by the quadrupolar interaction via quantum fluctuations of orbital - like `` spins '' , @xmath35s . in section v the @xmath36 representation is used for the case of a single @xmath37 hole ( configuration @xmath38 ) , which is likely ascribed to the rare - earth compound tmte . in the concluding section we discuss what kind of experiments could be critical for establishing the nature of the afq order unambigiously .",
    "we represent the set of the @xmath8 states with use of the @xmath39 ( abbreviation for @xmath40 ) basis in the following form : @xmath41    the quartet constituents in eq.([j ] ) are labelled in such a way in order to make use of the pauli matrices , @xmath42 and @xmath34 , convenient . for each @xmath43 ,",
    "the kramers doublet @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45    the orbital doublet @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be suitably defined with using the pseudo - spin operator @xmath34 as @xmath48    this representation was proposed in @xcite ; however , expressions for the magnetic moment in terms of @xmath33 and @xmath49 , given in @xcite , are oversimplified .    in order to derive formulae for the moments ( * j * , * s * , * l * , * m * ) , we need to calculate the matrix elements of , say , * j * over the set @xmath50 : @xmath51 within the russell - saunders scheme , the matrix elements of the moments can be obtained from their @xmath52 counterpart in accordance with @xmath53-factors of the @xmath54 multiplet : @xmath55    using the matrix elements ( [ j1 ] ) we can express the operator of magnetic moment * m * , which is associated with @xmath8 as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 the derivation of formulae ( [ mom ] ) from the set of matrix elements ( [ j1 ] ) is outlined in appendix a. note , that the @xmath58-component is not involved in ( [ mom ] ) . for the zeeman interaction @xmath59 we shall use representation ( [ mom])-([mom1 ] ) . in ( [ hz ] ) the sum",
    "runs over the ce lattice sites . as usual , summation over repeated indices ( @xmath60 , cartesian coordinates ) is supposed .",
    "let us discuss some simple properties of hamiltonian ( [ hz ] ) , which are important in experimental applications to ceb@xmath0 .    1 .",
    "if the `` orbital '' , _ i.e. _ , @xmath35-subsystem exhibits some afq order characterized by the modulation vector * q * , then at @xmath61 the effective zeeman term , acting on @xmath62s , produces , _ first _ , the uniform @xmath62-component , and _ second _ , the * q*-modulated @xmath62-components .",
    "both are absent in zero field . as a result ,",
    "a _ uniform",
    "_ magnetic field causes the * q*-modulated magnetization .",
    "this property of the afq phase has been used in neutron , nmr and @xmath18sr experiments . in the weak - field region , with @xmath15 not exceeding few tesla , the * q*-modulated magnetization is linear in @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   in the magnetically ordered phase ( see fig .",
    "2 ) the bragg peaks are related either to the single * k*-structure ( either @xmath63 $ ] , or @xmath64 $ ] ) , or to the double * k*-structure ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "these peaks at @xmath28 and @xmath65 are accompanied by the bragg peaks at @xmath66 $ ] and @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "this fact can be easily understood if we note , that magnetization ( [ mom ] ) is related not only to the @xmath62-modulations ( wave vectors @xmath28 and/or @xmath29 ) , but also to the ( @xmath68)-modulations . the latter correspond to wave vectors @xmath69 and/or @xmath70 with @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "non - interacting @xmath8 ionic states can be realized practically , say , in la@xmath72ce@xmath73b@xmath0 .",
    "owing to a non - trivial form of the zeeman interaction , magnetization is not aligned with @xmath74 except for a few special @xmath15-orientations , _",
    "e.g. _ , [ 001 ] , [ 110 ] , [ 111 ] , and their equivalents . at fixed @xmath15 the bigger energy gain",
    "is achieved for directions of the [ 001]-type . this kind of * h*anisotropy is an inherent property of the well - isolated @xmath8 states .",
    "not only the vector moments , but the quadrupolar moment @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) on a ce site as well , can be expressed in terms of the @xmath42 and @xmath34 operators . for calculating the matrix elements of @xmath75 over the set @xmath50 , @xmath77 we can employ the wigner - eckhart theorem , according to which",
    "these matrix elements are proportional to the operator equivalents : @xmath78 given below are the matrix elements of the quadrupolar moment ; we measure them in units of @xmath79 _ i.e. _ , @xmath80    the @xmath81 matrix elements can be classified as @xmath62-independent @xmath82 as well as the @xmath62-dependent @xmath83 we omit the hermitian conjugated matrix elements in eqs.([q_ind])-([q_dep ] ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath84 can be written in the operator form as ( see appendix a for elementary explanations ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 . the fact that @xmath75 contains the @xmath62-variables signals that the quadrupolar interaction can be responsible not only for pure orbital interactions , but also for magnetic interactions .",
    "the dependences of @xmath87 and @xmath75 on @xmath33 and @xmath34 determine the time - reversal properties of the @xmath42 and @xmath34 components .",
    "it is evident from ( [ mom ] ) that @xmath42@xmath88@xmath42 under @xmath89 , whereas @xmath90 and @xmath91 are unchanged .",
    "the off - diagonal components of @xmath75 require @xmath92 under the time - reversal transformation .",
    "we suppose that the predominant contribution to the interactions of ce ions in ceb@xmath0 comes from their quadrupolar interaction , the role of which in ce compounds was first mentioned by bleaney @xcite ( for a discussion on various forms of the quadrupolar interaction see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we accept the form of the quadrupolar interaction of the electrostatic origin , which is free of any model assumptions .",
    "thus , our consideration is confined to the zeeman and quadrupolar interactions : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is determined by the interaction @xmath95 of two quadrupolar moments located at @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath98 thus , we obtain from ( [ v ] ) @xmath99 evident are the following properties of @xmath100 s with respect to permutation of indices : @xmath101 the diagonal elements of matrix @xmath84 give rise to the order parameter which is transformed according to representation @xmath102 characterized by two components ( @xmath103 ) of @xmath34 , while the off - diagonal elements are related to symmetry @xmath104 and are characterized by the vector @xmath105 .",
    "keeping this in mind , we can rewrite @xmath106 as follows : @xmath107\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the greek indices @xmath108 prescribe summation over @xmath109- and @xmath110-components only .",
    "the expressions for @xmath111 and @xmath112 are given in appendix b. the hamiltonian in eq.([qd1 ] ) represents an evident separation of the orbital - like and spin - like parts .",
    "the magnetic exchange interactions are not relevant for a theoretical analysis of the afq ordering in ceb@xmath0 .",
    "this applies to a major part of the phase diagram outside its low - temperature - and - weak - field part .",
    "the latter requires the rkky- and kondo - like interactions to be included .",
    "taking the fourier transform of the hamiltonian ( [ qd1 ] ) , we arrive at its * k*-diagonal form : @xmath113 \\tau_{{\\bf k},\\alpha}^*\\tau_{{\\bf k},\\beta}+{\\cal b}^{ij}[{\\bf k } ] \\mu_{{\\bf k},i}^*\\mu_{{\\bf k},j}\\right\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the notation @xmath114 $ ] and @xmath115 $ ] for the fourier transformed coupling constants at general @xmath27 . for high symmetry points of reciprocal space , such as [ 000 ] ,",
    "@xmath116 $ ] , @xmath117 $ ] and @xmath118 $ ] , as well as along the cubic edge @xmath119 $ ] , the fourier transformed hamiltonian ( [ qdk ] ) becomes completely diagonal : @xmath120 table i shows the result of numerical calculations for the coefficients in units of @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the lattice constant .",
    "let us estimate the order of such an energy unit .",
    "in doing so , we return to definition ( [ unit ] ) , and then , performing the radial and angular integrations , we get : @xmath123 then , the energy unit becomes @xmath124 for ceb@xmath0 , the lattice constant @xmath125 4  , the @xmath37-electron radius @xmath126  , the lattice coulomb unit @xmath127 3 ev , and we arrive at the @xmath128-unit of order 1 k ( cf .",
    ", however , @xcite ) . from table",
    "i one can see that the coefficients @xmath129 are small as compared to the dominant ones , @xmath130s .",
    "additional smallness of the @xmath131-terms comes from the fact that the maximal value of @xmath132 is 16/3 times smaller than the maximal value of @xmath133 .",
    "thus , it seems appropriate to simplify the model by neglecting the @xmath131-terms and to employ the simplified version of @xmath106 in its purely orbital @xmath35-form : @xmath134    according to table i , the global energy minimum could be achieved at @xmath135 .",
    "not only the high - symmetry points of reciprocal space , but also wave vectors of a general position have been checked numerically in order to identify @xmath136 with the global energy minimum .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize that the energies at @xmath137 $ ] and @xmath136 are only slightly different .",
    "this is an indication of pronounced soft modes along the directions of cubic edges , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath138 , [ \\frac 12\\kappa\\frac 12]$ ] and @xmath139,-\\frac 12\\leq\\kappa\\leq\\frac 12 $ ] .",
    "thus , competing afq patterns create fluctuations which should significantly decrease the afq - d transition temperature , as compared to the mean - field estimate .",
    "the wave vector * q * is consistent with the afq patterns which have been found experimentally by the grenoble group @xcite .    at the two points of reciprocal space , namely , @xmath140 and * q *",
    ", we have @xmath141",
    ". then the fourier transform of @xmath142 takes a planar form @xmath143 in other high - symmetry points , @xmath144 $ ] and @xmath118 $ ] , @xmath142 exhibits an easy - axis form with non - equal values of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "it is also valid for a general point of reciprocal space , but , in general , the off - diagonal component @xmath147 is non - zero , and the easy - axis should be different from either @xmath109-axis or @xmath110-axis .",
    "it is worth noting , that searching for the ground state energy of the _ classical _ vector field @xmath34 by using a fourier transformation of hamiltonian ( [ orb ] ) ( also known as the luttinger - tissa method ) would be a standard procedure , if the hamiltonian were invariant under the homogeneous @xmath34 rotations . nevertheless , although the rotational symmetry of @xmath142 at @xmath148 $ ] and @xmath149 $ ] is broken , the energy values listed in table i are rigorous .      in this section",
    "we consider a quantum effect , namely the zero motion of the @xmath35 `` spins '' with respect to the afq background .",
    "in fact , when a decoupling procedure is applied to the @xmath131 terms in ( [ qd1 ] ) , we obtain the effective spin - like hamiltonian : @xmath150 @xmath58 does not enter the hamiltonian ( [ orb ] ) ; this is responsible for the formation of the orbital ordering .",
    "this would be a reason for neglecting all the contributions caused by @xmath58 , including interaction ( [ qd_m ] ) , were it not for quantum fluctuations of @xmath34 .",

    "@xmath159 is a periodic function of @xmath154 with periodicity @xmath160 .",

    "@xmath162 and @xmath163 remain unchanged , if @xmath154 is simultaneously shifted by @xmath160 .",
    "numerical calculations show that @xmath164 , etc .",
    ", are related to equivalent minimums of @xmath159 . using one of them ,",
    "say , at @xmath165 , we calculate the correlation functions ( [ tau_y ] ) numerically .",
    "the sign of the first neighbor correlators is negative : @xmath166 , @xmath167 .",
    "this is a reminder of the afq ordering . among the second neighbors only @xmath168 are not negligible , all others are much smaller . for the resulting coupling constants of ( [ qd_m ] )",
    "see appendix b.    this curious mechanism which , in principle , leads to the effective magnetic interactions ( see ( [ qd_m ] ) ) , could be a reason for magnetic ordering at temperatures much smaller than @xmath14 , because , _ first _ , the @xmath131 coupling constants of hamiltonian ( [ qdk ] ) are much less numerically than their @xmath130 counterparts , and , _ second _ , the additional smallness comes from the quantum fluctuations of @xmath58 s .",
    "the low - temperature magnetism in ceb@xmath0 is unlikely to be described by such an unusual mechanism .",
