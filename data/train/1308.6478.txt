    "a value of @xmath81 ( @xmath2 10@xmath89 s@xmath16 ) helps to achieve and mantain a high n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance .",
    "a pre - shock density of @xmath2 10@xmath12 @xmath6 is consistent with the results suggested by the study of deuteration in l1157-b1 ( codella et al .",
    "2012b ) where it was found that the most likely scenario is that of a a gas passing through a pre - shock phase with @xmath64 @xmath47 4 @xmath10 10@xmath12 @xmath6 , during which formaldehyde and methanol ices are formed .",
    "we present the first detection of diazenylium towards outflowing gas far from the driven low - mass protostar .",
    "we found evidence that n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) emission observed towards the l1157-b1 shock originates from the dense ( @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) gas associated with the cavities opened , and accelerated by the prototellar wind .",
    "the line width ( @xmath4 4 km s@xmath16 ) is significantly broader than the n@xmath0h@xmath1 line widths previously observed towards the driving protostar l1157-mm ( @xmath22 1 km s@xmath16 ) , as well as than the typical line widths observed in quiescent regions , probably as a result of the energy injection from the sweeping outflow .",
    "the estimated n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance is ( 28 ) @xmath10 10@xmath11 , which can be reproduced by a model of quiescent gas evolved for more than 10@xmath12 yr ( i.e. older than the shock kinematical age , 2000 yr ) . in other words",
    ", n@xmath0h@xmath1 can be considered a fossil record of the pre - shock phase , when the gas density was @xmath2 10@xmath12 @xmath6 .",
    "modelling of c - shocks confirms that @xmath72(n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) is not enhanced by the passage of the shock .",
    "the present n@xmath0h@xmath1 detection is the result of the increase of its column density due to the compression ( by a factor @xmath2 10 ) of swept - up material , and not to its relative abundance .    c. codella , c. ceccarelli , b. lefloch , and s. viti",
