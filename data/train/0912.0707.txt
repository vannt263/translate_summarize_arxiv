    "the code used to generate events is , therefore , missing the terms that are completely due to new physics : those proportional to the anomalous couplings squared .",
    "this approximation is justified because those terms do not generate @xmath0-odd correlations .",
    "in addition , as long as the conditions that allow us to write the new physics in terms of anomalous couplings remain valid , their contribution to the total cross - section is small .    for event generation",
    "we require the top quark and @xmath20 boson intermediate states to be within 15 widths of their mass shell , and two sets of cuts .",
    "the first set of cuts includes a minimum transverse momentum for all leptons and jets , a minimal separation between them , and a pseudorapidity acceptance range : @xmath59 with @xmath60 .    for the second set of cuts ( in the lepton plus jets channel ) we add a missing transverse energy requirement @xmath61 we use sm parameter values as in madgraph , except for @xmath62 ; and we use the cteq-6l1 parton distribution functions .",

    "the relatively large number @xmath69 is chosen to facilitate distinguishing signals from statistical fluctuations .",
    "once we establish a non - zero asymmetry we can cast our result as a function of the anomalous couplings since the asymmetries are linear in them .",
    "as mentioned above , we include the new physics only through its interference with the sm .",
    "since these @xmath0-odd terms are also @xmath27 odd , they do not affect the cross - sections as they integrate to zero .",

    "this is due to two reasons : first the gluon fusion initiated process is more sensitive to the anomalous couplings . for the case of the tevatron , only about 15% of top - quark pairs are produced via this mechanism .",
    "numerically we have seen that if we restrict the top - quark pair sample to that originating from gluon fusion , the asymmetries increase roughly by factors of three .",
    "the second reason is that the di - lepton channel is more sensitive to these anomalous couplings .",
    "in addition , the statistical sensitivity of the tevatron with 1000 events is about five times below that of a @xmath91 run at lhc which would produce about 23000 @xmath3 dimuon events after the cuts in eq .",
