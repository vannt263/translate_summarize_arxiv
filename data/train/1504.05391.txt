    "high - mass stars are very energetic and influential on dynamics of the interstellar medium via stellar winds , ultraviolet radiation and supernova explosions .",
    "injection of the heavy elements at the end of their lives is another important effect of high - mass stars in galactic evolution .",
    "it is therefore one of the most important issues in astrophysics to understand formation of high - mass stars and considerable efforts have been made by a number of works published so far ( for recent reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is now generally accepted that most of the high - mass stars are formed by mass accretion instead of collisional stellar merging after some years of debates . in the current paradigm ,",
    "monolithic collapse @xcite and competitive accretion @xcite are the two scenarios of the mass accretion processes . in the monolithic collapse",
    "a massive dense molecular cloud is the initial condition for the star formation , which is followed by disk accretion , whereas in the competitive accretion a massive cluster of stars / pre - stellar cores is assumed to grow in mass by accretion of the ambient gas .",
    "the two scenarios still lack detailed confrontation with the initial conditions provided by observations .",
    "this is in part due to the lack of well - resolved observational views of high - mass star formation at small distances ; even the orion nebular cluster , the most outstanding high - mass star forming region at the smallest distance 400pc , is three times more distant than typical low - mass star - forming regions like taurus , and the second nearests are at a distance around 2kpc .",
    "therefore , our understanding of high - mass star formation yet remains to be significantly corroborated .",
    "it is interesting to note that insight - full discussion is made on the mechanisms of high - mass star formation in the review article by @xcite , where we find the following sentence : `` rapid external shock compression ( i.e. , supersonic gas motions ) generating high - column densities in less than a local free - fall time rather than slow quasi - static build - up of massive cores may be the recipe to set up the initial conditions for local and global bursts of massive star formation . ''",
    "this idea of supersonic gas motions to collect gas was not explored further in the literature in the context of high - mass star formation except for the several papers on cloud - cloud collision discussed in section 1.3 .",
    "molecular observations with nanten2 have shown that o - type star formation in the milky way disk is triggered by supersonic collisions between two clouds at velocity of 1030@xmath0 in several places .",
    "the first discovery was made in the super star cluster westerlund2 which is ionizing an hii region rcw49 @xcite , and the authors suggested that two giant molecular clouds collided to trigger formation of the cluster some 2myrs ago .",
    "these observations were followed by discovery of cloud - cloud collisions which triggered formation of the super star cluster / mini - starburst in ngc3603 @xcite , and formation of the single o star in hii regions m20 @xcite and rcw120 @xcite .",
    "most recently , in the large magellanic cloud alma observations led to a discovery of formation of a 40@xmath6 star n159w - s triggered by collision between two filamentary clouds at a relative velocity of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these results raise a novel possibility that formation of o stars may be due to , or at least facilitated , by the supersonic compression in cloud - cloud collision , which was not considered in the theories for high - mass star formation , either in the monolithic collapse or in the competitive accretion scenarios . on a global scale of galaxies , numerical simulations show that collisions between clouds are fairly frequent at every @xmath510myrs @xcite , which is similar to an evolutionary timescale of giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "it is thus becoming possible to consider cloud - cloud collision as one of the modes of high - mass star formation .",
    "cloud - cloud collision was studied using hydrodynamics simulations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these authors found that cloud - cloud collision induces the formation of cloud cores by enhanced self - gravity as a consequence of shock compression , while the connection of cloud - cloud collision to high - mass star formation was not discussed into depth .",
    "recent magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) numerical simulations on cloud - cloud collision show that colliding molecular gas can indeed create dense and massive cloud cores , precursors of high - mass stars , in the shock - compressed interface , giving a theoretical basis for triggered the o - star formation @xcite . in the simulations after the collision the density increases from 3001000@xmath8 to @xmath9@xmath8 and the turbulent velocity and magnetic field increase by about a factor of five , leading to a 100-times higher mass - accretion rate to form stars .",
    "this indicates that the conditions for the high mass - accretion rate postulated in high - mass star formation theories @xcite are created by cloud - cloud collision .",
    "following these findings , as a next step we need to have a better understanding on the physical details of the collision , which include direct observations of the shock interaction as well as the statistical properties of cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "we are carrying out a systematic study of high - mass star formation toward hii regions in order to elucidate the role of cloud - cloud collision with nanten2 , mopra , and aste telescopes .",
    "these hii regions include spitzer bubbles , compact hii regions , and mini - starbursts including ngc6334 , ngc6357 , w43 , etc .      hoping to better understand the origin of massive clusters we in this paper focus ourselves on the super star cluster rcw38 @xcite , which is the youngest super star cluster with an age of @xmath101myr in the milky way ( @xcite ; see also table2 in @xcite ) .",
    "+ citetwol2006 estimated the age of rcw38 as 0.5myrs with an upper limit of 1myrs so that it does not conflict with the number of o stars for the size of the cluster , and @xcite measured the ages of the several members of the rcw38 cluster , which ranges from 0.13.5myrs .",
    "the cluster age may be even smaller than 0.5myrs as discussed in the present paper ( section 4 ) .",
    "the extreme youth will benefit study of the molecular gas close to the central o stars , which is particularly important to address the ionization / dispersal of the molecular gas .",
    "rcw38 has large total mass , similar to that of the orion nebula cluster , and is an active high - mass star forming region , second nearest to the sun , at a distance of 1.7kpc .",
    "an overview of the previous studies on rcw38 is summarized in an article by @xcite .",
    "rcw38 is known as one of the closest high - mass star forming regions containing @xmath510,000 stars ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) ( figure[rcw38 ] ) .",
    "in the central part of rcw38 , two remarkable infrared peaks have been identified @xcite .",
    "the brightest at 2@xmath11 m is labeled irs2 , which corresponds to an o5.5 binary located at the center of the rcw38 cluster @xcite . @xcite",
    "derived a total infrared luminosity toward irs2 to be @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "the brightest feature at 10@xmath11 m is found 0.1pc west of irs2 , and is labelled irs1 .",
    "irs1 is a dust ridge extending by 0.10.2pc in the north - south direction ( figure[rcw38]b ) , which has a color temperature of about 175k and includes several dust condensations @xcite .",
    "infrared and millimeter wave observations has indicated a `` ring - like '' or `` horseshoe '' structure around irs2 about 1@xmath142@xmath14 across @xcite . inside the ring - like shape two regions are cleared of dust and form cavities ; one is the region centered on irs2 with a diameter of @xmath50.1pc , and another is just west of irs1 with a similar size @xcite , suggesting that they were formed by feedbacks from high - mass stars .",
    "a large - area infrared image shows that rcw38 includes numerous filaments and bubbles ( see figure[rcw38]a ) .",
    "@xcite made comparisons of the dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) maps with the c[ii ] 158@xmath11 m map and discussed that the pahs and dust grains are well mixed along the line - of - sight and pahs play an important role for photo - electric heating of gas in photo - dissociation regions .",
    "many observational studies to investigate the cluster members of rcw38 have been carried out so far .",
    "near infrared observations by using the very large telescope ( vlt ) identified more than 300 young stars for the @xmath50.5pc@xmath15 area centered on irs2 @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ observations reported by @xcite were used to identify 345 x - ray sources likely associated with rcw38 , and completeness arguments suggest a total estimated cluster size of between 1500 and 2400 stars .",

    "we interpret that the dark lane toward irs1 along with another dust feature comprising the western cavity corresponds to the finger cloud which probably lies on the near side of the cluster .",
    "irs1 is clearly irradiated by the cluster and the physical association of the bridging feature with the cluster is supported .",
    "the number of known super star clusters in the milky way is 13 , including rcw38 and the 12 clusters listed in table2 of @xcite .",
    "the cluster members of rcw38 were previously estimated to be a few 1000 ( wolk et al .",
    "2006 ) and rcw38 was not included in the table by @xcite which limited the cluster mass to be more than @xmath65@xmath6 .",
    "the recent estimate shows that rcw38 harbors 10,000 stars @xcite and it is appropriate to include rcw38 as one of the super star clusters . among the 13 rcw38 is the youngest one with an estimated age of less than 1myr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the present work ) and the ages of the others are @xmath102myrs . the orion nebula cluster is listed as an ob association with an age of 1myr in @xcite .",
    "the ambient interstellar medium will reflect youth of a cluster , and cloud dispersal by the feedback will be less intensive in younger clusters than in more evolved clusters . according to eye inspection of the infrared images , only five clusters among the 13 clusters , rcw38 , ngc3603 , westerlund2 , dbs[2003]179 , and trumpler14 ,",
    "are associated with dust nebulosity , and their ages are from 2myrs to 3.5myrs except for rcw38 . the remaining 8 clusters , most of which have ages between 3.5myrs and 18myrs , have no associated nebulosity , with an exception of the arches cluster having an age of 2myrs .",
    "it is likely that the interstellar medium around the 8 clusters is completely dispersed by the stellar feedback including ionization and stellar winds .",
    "figure [ radial_plot ] shows the averaged co intensity in the three clusters with nebulosity rcw38 , ngc3603 , and westerlund2 , and indicates that rcw38 still has significant molecular mass within @xmath53pc of the cluster . in westerlund2 and ngc3603 whose ages are 2myrs the central part of the molecular clouds within 10pc of the cluster is already strongly ionized / dispersed .",
    "the rich remaining gas toward the cluster is a unique feature of rcw38 and is consistent with its age significantly smaller than 2myrs .",
    "rcw38 may therefore provide a best opportunity to study the initial conditions for the super star cluster formation .",
    "the present observations have revealed the distribution of the two molecular clouds with 12@xmath0 velocity separation toward rcw38 at a spatial resolution of @xmath50.1pc .",
    "the following pieces of evidence offer robust verification of the association between the two clouds and the cluster .    1 .",
    "the ring cloud shows a central cavity created by the feedback of the cluster .",
    "the ring cloud is also associated with the infrared filamentary / bubble - like features heated by the cluster .",
    "the finger cloud shows good correspondence with irs1 and the western cavity .",
    "the morphological correspondence supports the physical association of the clouds with the cluster .",
    "the line intensity ratio of the @xmath1co @xmath4=32 emission to @xmath1co @xmath4=10 emission shows significantly high values , indicating high gas temperatures toward the cluster .",
    "lvg calculations show that the temperature there is higher than 2030k , consistent with local heating by the o stars in the cluster .",
    "another sign of the connection between the two clouds is seen as the bridging features in velocity between them at least in three places including the direction of the cluster center .",
    "alternative possibility that the bridging features are due to stellar winds is unlikely as discussed later in this section .    in rcw38",
    "the observed cloud velocity separation is large 12@xmath0 as seen in the previous two cases westerlund2 and ngc3603 @xcite .",
    "the velocity is too large for the clouds to be gravitationally bound by the total mass of the clouds and cluster , less than @xmath103@xmath6 .",
    "this indicates that the association of the two clouds is by chance .",
    "we frame a hypothesis that the two clouds collided with each other recently and that the collision triggered formation of stars , primarily o stars , as have been suggested for westerlund2 and ngc3603 .",
    "we note that the fourth and fifth super star clusters with nebulosity , dbs[2003]179 and trumpler14 , are also associated with two molecular clouds which appear colliding to form the cluster ( kuwahara et al . in preparation ; fukui et al . in preparation ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the five super star clusters with nebulosity are all formed by triggering under cloud - cloud collision , suggesting the important role of collision in formation of a super star cluster and multiple o stars . in the remaining 8 super star clusters without associated nebulosity",
    "it is not likely that we are able to detect the parent molecular clouds .",
    "stellar wind acceleration may be an alternative interpretation to cloud - cloud collision ( e.g. , see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we see a velocity gradient in the finger cloud of rcw38 ( section3 ) , which may suggest some acceleration by the o stars via the stellar winds .",
    "this is however not likely because the gradient is extended outside the cluster and rather uniform over the finger cloud ; the velocity shift should be most prominent toward the cluster if the winds originating from the o stars play a role .",
    "we also note that the finger cloud is located on the nearside of the cluster as suggested by the coincidence with irs1 ( figure[vlt+red ] ) , implying that the wind acceleration will cause blue - shift instead of the observed red - shift .",
    "the collision between the two clouds is therefore a plausible interpretation , and we exclude wind acceleration as the cause of the two velocities of the clouds .",
    "the possible role of the winds in acceleration raises an alternative to the origin of the bridging feature toward the cluster center . since the bridging feature , having a tight link with the finger cloud , shows a good correspondence with the o stars ( figure [ spi0]d ) , the bridging feature may be part of the finger cloud accelerated by the stellar winds and not created by the collision .",
    "the mass of the bridging feature in figure11d is estimated to be 17@xmath82 from the @xmath1co intensity with the x(co ) factor .",
    "the kinetic energy in the bridging feature is estimated to be @xmath104erg , small enough to be accelerated by the winds of @xmath520 o stars whose kinetic energy can be more than @xmath105erg ( e.g. , in @xcite ) . in this scenario , the wind - accelerated gas will be blue - shifted since the finger cloud lies in front of the o stars .",
    "this contradicts red - shift of the bridging feature .",
    "the velocity range of the bridging feature which lies only between the two velocities of the colliding clouds , not beyond the velocity of the finger cloud , is also consistent with the collision @xcite .",
    "the other two bridging features in the south ( figure [ comp ] ) are not associated with o stars and it is unlikely that the winds are a source of acceleration . to summarize ,",
    "the three bridging features are likely formed by the collisional interaction between the ring cloud and the finger cloud , lending additional support for the cloud - cloud collision .",
    "recent theoretical studies of global numerical simulations of galactic disks indicate that collisions between giant molecular clouds are frequent with a mean free interval of @xmath510myrs @xcite .",
    "this is comparable to the typical lifetime of a giant molecular cloud 20myrs @xcite , suggesting that a giant molecular cloud experiences cloud - cloud collision more than once in its lifetime .",
    "it is also possible that the relatively rich molecular gas in the vela molecular ridge where rcw38 is located @xcite favors more frequent encounters between the clouds than the average over the wilky way .",
    "currently , we see the two clouds , the bridging feature , and the o star cluster , all of which are within 1pc of the cluster center . the ring cloud has a cavity of 0.3pc radius which is likely ionized by irs2 and the other o stars .",
    "the finger cloud is probably being ionized and observed as irs1 whose surface is irradiated by the o stars .",
    "theoretical studies of the collision scenario show that a shock - compressed interface layer is formed between the two clouds @xcite .",
    "it is likely that major part of the interface layer has already been converted to the o stars and that the bridging feature is a remnant of the interface layer .    by assuming tentatively that the relative cloud motion is inclined to the line of sight by 45@xmath106",
    ", we estimate the relative velocity of the two clouds to be 17@xmath0 .",
    "the actual velocity of the shocked interface layer may be decelerated by momentum conversation in collision between the two clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and we adopt 10 @xmath0 as the relative velocity of the interface layer .",
    "the distribution of the triggering - formed o stars is extended by about 1pc ( figure[spi0 ] ) .",
    "we estimate the typical collision timescale to be @xmath107 , which gives roughly the age of the o stars in the cluster .",
    "if we assume the o stars are formed by a constant mass accretion rate in the collision time scale @xmath103 yrs , the mass accretion rate is estimated to be @xmath108/yr for a 40@xmath82 star ( an o5.5 star ) .",
    "magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations of cloud - cloud collision have shown that the turbulence is enhanced and the magnetic field is amplified in the interface layer @xcite .",
    "this leads to two orders of magnitude increase of the mass accretion rate from the pre - collision state ; e.g. , a core of 126@xmath82 is formed in 0.3myrs in the shocked interface layer as shown by model4 of inoue and fukui ( 2013 ) and such a massive core is a promising precursor of an o star .",
    "the total mass of the o stars in rcw38 is estimated to be @xmath109 , if we assume a typical mass of an o star to be 20@xmath82 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath510% of the total @xmath3co clump mass of the ring cloud 3000@xmath82 ( see table1 ) .",
    "the cavity of the ring cloud is created by ionization of the o stars .",
    "the propagating velocity of the ionization front is roughly estimated to be 3 @xmath0 from a ratio 0.3pc/@xmath103yrs .",
    "this is consistent with the ionization front velocity in a molecular cloud driven by hii regions @xcite . in figure[radial_plot ] rcw38 shows a molecular peak within 3pc of the center , whereas the other two ngc3603 and westerlund2 show decrease of molecular gas within 10pc of the cluster .",
    "this trend is explained as due to ionization .",
    "the latter two clusters have an age of 2myrs , an order of magnitude larger than rcw38 . by taking a ratio of 10pc/2myrs , we roughly estimate the average velocity of the ionization front to be 5@xmath0 , which is comparable to 3@xmath0 in rcw38 .",
    "if we assume velocity of the ionization front to be 35@xmath0 and common molecular cloud density , the ring cloud of 1pc radius will be ionized within 0.20.3myrs and triggered star formation will be completely terminated .",
    "this poses an upper limit of a few times 0.1myrs for the age spread of the stars formed by triggering .",
    "we note that the age spreads of the youngest members of the two super star clusters , ngc3603 and westerlund1 , are determined to be 0.10.3myrs , an order of magnitude larger than their cluster age 25myrs , by a careful photometric study with vlt for proper - motion selected young cluster members with hst @xcite .",
    "we note that model calculations of ngc3603 by @xcite and @xcite also suggest the rapid cluster formation through a single starburst event followed by significant residual gas explusion . the small age spread is possibly explained by the collision scenario so that formation of @xmath520 o stars by triggering is terminated quickly due to the ionization in the order of 0.1myrs . most of the low - mass stars were probably formed in the ring cloud prior to the cloud - cloud collision , since they are extended over the ring cloud with a radius of a few pc ( figure[rcw38 ] ) .",
    "we suggest that this naturally causes duality in the stellar age in rcw38 ; i.e. , young o stars of 0.1-myr age and older low - mass stars of 1-myr age , which is to be observationally confirmed for the cluster members at infrared and x rays .",
    "such duality in age is also found in the other super star clusters ( e.g. , for ngc3603 see @xcite ) .",
    "it is shown that cloud - cloud collision triggered formation of the o stars in center of the super star cluster rcw38 .",
    "the present two clouds show a sign of collisional interaction , the bridging features , in the three regions denoted as br1 , br2 and br3 in figure5 . only br1 shows formation of multiple o stars with projected density of @xmath530(pc)@xmath110 @xmath111 $ ] , and br2 and br3 no o star formation .",
    "the ring cloud has the highest molecular column density @xmath112@xmath79 around br1 and has lower column density of @xmath113@xmath79 in br2 and br3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the finger cloud has nearly uniform column density of @xmath114@xmath79 , and the relative velocities between the two clouds are almost the same in the three regions .",
    "we suggest that the high column density is the necessary condition for o star formation in cloud - cloud collision .",
    "the total molecular masses toward the three regions are estimated to be @xmath5260@xmath82 , @xmath590@xmath82 , and @xmath5100@xmath82 , respectively , suggesting that br2 and br3 are probably not massive enough to form multiple o stars like in br1 , while it is possible that the collision is in its early phase prior to o star formation in br2 and br3 .",
    "table3 compares the observational properties of the molecular clouds in rcw38 with the other two super star clusters , westerlund2 @xcite and ngc3603 @xcite , and with the single o stars in m20 @xcite , and rcw120 @xcite , where cloud - cloud collision is suggested to be a trigger of o star formation .",
    "the comparison shows a trend that the multiple o star formation as in rcw38 is found only for a high column density of @xmath115@xmath79 in either of the two clouds , whereas the cloud mass and relative velocity do not show a particular trend in multiple o star formation ; i.e. , the mass range is from @xmath116 to @xmath117 and the observed relative velocity is 1030@xmath0 in either of the multiple or single o star formation .",
    "the high column density in one of the two colliding clouds is therefore possibly the necessary condition for the multiple o star formation .",
    "the two scenarios for high - mass star formation , the monolithic collapse and competitive accretion , are not yet verified by confrontation with observations @xcite .",
    "cloud - cloud collision , another possible scenario for high - mass star formation , provides directly testable three observational signatures including with and between the two clouds , and rcw38 show all the signatures .",
    "according to @xcite , the effective sound speed in the shocked interface layer is isotropic and given roughly as the velocity separation of the two colliding gas .",
    "it is then possible that low velocity collision of molecular gas may lead to a lower mass accretion rate and formation of a lower mass star .",
    "observations of low - mass star formation without o stars triggered by cloud - cloud collision are presented by several authors @xcite .",
    "the relative velocity of these collisions is as small as a few kms@xmath55 , and leaves room for non - triggered star formation under a gravitationally bound system.it remains to be explored what is the role of cloud - cloud collision in low - mass star formation .",
    "we have carried out co @xmath4=10 and @xmath4=32 observations toward the super star cluster rcw38 with mopra , aste and nanten2 mm / sub - mm telescopes .",
    "the main conclusions of the present study are summarized as follows ;    1 .",
    "we have revealed distributions of two molecular clouds at velocities of 2@xmath0 and 14@xmath0 toward rcw38 .",
    "the ring cloud ( the 2@xmath0 cloud ) shows a ring - like shape with a cavity ionized by the cluster and has a high molecular column density of @xmath118@xmath79 .",
    "the other , the finger cloud ( the 14@xmath0 cloud ) , has a tip toward the cluster and has a lower molecular column density of @xmath119@xmath79 .",
    "the total masses of the ring cloud and the finger cloud are @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "it is likely that the two clouds are physically associated with the cluster as verified by the high intensity ratio of the @xmath4=32 transition to the @xmath4=10 transition , @xmath56 , toward the cluster .",
    "the observed ratio indicates kinetic temperature of @xmath12230k according to the lvg calculations , which is significantly higher than the canonical molecular cloud temperature 10k with no extra heat source .",
    "the heating is mainly due to the o stars .",
    "the association is further supported by the distribution of the molecular clouds corresponding to the cluster and the infrared dust features ; the ring cloud shows the cavity toward the cluster center and good coincidence with the extended dust features , and the finger cloud corresponds to the infrared ridge irs1 .",
    "in addition , the two clouds are linked with each other by bridging features in velocity at least in three places including the direction of the cluster , supporting further the physical connection between the two clouds .",
    "3 .   the total mass of the clouds and",
    "the cluster is less than @xmath123@xmath6 .",
    "the velocity separation of 12@xmath0 is too large for the clouds to be gravitationally bound , and we suggest that the clouds encountered by chance .",
    "we present an interpretation that the two clouds collided 0.1myrs ago at 17 kms@xmath55 with each other to trigger formation of the o stars in the cluster .",
    "we argue that the double o5.5 star ( irs2 ) was formed within this timescale at an average mass accretion rate @xmath124@xmath6yr@xmath55 .",
    "the tip of the finger cloud and the bridging feature connecting the two clouds well coincide with the o stars within 0.5pc of the cluster center , indicating that the triggering happened only toward the inner 0.5pc and the other member low - mass stars outside 0.5pc are pre - existent , being extended over the ring cloud where collisional interaction is not taking place .",
    "rcw38 is the third super star cluster alongside of westerlund2 and ngc3603 where cloud - cloud collision triggered o star formation in a super star cluster , lending further support for an important role of supersonic collision in o star formation . among the three super star clusters ,",
    "rcw38 is unique because it is the youngest cluster where the initial conditions prior to the o - star formation still hold without significant cloud dispersal by stellar feedbacks beyond 1pc .",
    "the present findings suggest a possibility to prepare a recipe for o star formation in a super star cluster . multiple o star formation is triggered where collision of two clouds at velocity 1030@xmath0 takes place .",
    "one of the clouds has a high column density of @xmath118@xmath79 , while the other has a lower column density .",
    "since o star formation takes place only at the spots of the collision , the distribution of o stars keeps the distribution of the collisional interaction as long as the gravitational rearrangement of o stars after the collision does not play a role .",
    "this picture provides a natural set up for the highly turbulent interstellar medium as the initial condition for o star formation along the line of suggestion by @xcite .    in order to better establish the role of cloud - cloud collision in o star formation , we need an extensive systematic study of molecular clouds toward a number of young hii regions and young stars whose mass exceeds 20@xmath6 .",
    "such a study is on - going and will allow us to test how cloud - cloud collision triggers and regulates o star formation .",
    "it is imperative to attain very high angular resolution in imaging the molecular gas to resolve dense cores in the shocked region and alma is the most important instrument toward the goal .",
    "it is also a challenge to test if mini - starbursts in galaxies are triggered by supersonic collisions between molecular clouds .",
