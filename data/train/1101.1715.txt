    "bayesian networks ( bns ) are a popular graphical formalism for representing probability distributions .",
    "a bn consists of structure and parameters .",
    "the structure , a directed and acyclic graph ( dag ) , induces a set of independencies that the represented probability distribution satisfies .",
    "the parameters specify the conditional probability distribution of each node given its parents in the structure .",
    "the bn represents the probability distribution that results from the product of these conditional probability distributions .",
    "typically , a single expert ( or learning algorithm ) is consulted to construct a bn of the domain at hand .",
    "therefore , there is a risk that the so - constructed bn is not as accurate as it could be if , for instance , the expert has a bias or overlooks certain details .",
    "one way to minimize this risk consists in obtaining multiple bns of the domain from multiple experts and , then , combining them into a single consensus bn . this approach has received significant attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "the most relevant of these references is probably @xcite , because it shows that even if the experts agree on the bn structure , no method for combining the experts bns produces a consensus bn that respects some reasonable assumptions and whose structure is the agreed bn structure .",
    "unfortunately , this problem is often overlooked . to avoid it",
    ", we propose to combine the experts bns in two steps .",
    "first , finding the consensus bn structure and , then , finding the consensus parameters for the consensus bn structure .",
    "this paper focuses only on the first step .",
    "specifically , we assume that multiple experts provide us with alternative dag models of a domain , and we are interested in combining them into a single consensus dag .",
    "specifically , we are interested in that the consensus dag only represents independences all the given dags agree upon and as many of them as possible . in other words ,",
    "the consensus dag is the dag that represents the most independences among all the minimal directed independence ( mdi ) maps of the intersection of the independence models induced by the given dags .",
    "is defined as the dag that contains the most of the arcs in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the difficulty lies in keeping as many arcs as possible without creating cycles .",
    "note that , unlike in the present work , a dag is not interpreted as inducing an independence model in @xcite . ] to our knowledge , whether the consensus dag can or can not be found efficiently is still an open problem .",
    "see @xcite for more information . in this paper",
    ", we redefine the consensus dag as the dag that has the fewest parameters associated among all the mdi maps of the intersection of the independence models induced by the given dags .",
    "this definition is in line with that of finding a dag to represent a probability distribution @xmath1 .",
    "the desired dag is typically defined as the mdi map of @xmath1 that has the fewest parameters associated rather than as the mdi map of @xmath1 that represents the most independences .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "the number of parameters associated with a dag is a measure of the complexity of the dag , since it is the number of parameters required to specify all the probability distributions that can be represented by the dag .    in this paper",
    ", we prove that there may exist several non - equivalent consensus dags and that finding one of them is np - hard .",
    "thus , we decide to resort to heuristics to find an approximated consensus dag . in this paper , we consider the following heuristic due to @xcite .",
    "first , let @xmath2 denote any ordering of the nodes in the given dags , which we denote here as @xmath0 .",
    "then , find the mdi map @xmath3 of each @xmath4 relative to @xmath2 .",
    "finally , let the approximated consensus dag be the dag whose arcs are exactly the union of the arcs in @xmath5 .",
    "it should be mentioned that our formulation of the heuristic differs from that in @xcite in the following two points .",
    "first , the heuristic was introduced under the original definition of consensus dag .",
    "we justify later that the heuristic also makes sense under our definition of consensus dag .",
    "second , @xmath2 was originally required to be consistent with one of the given dags .",
    "we remove this requirement .",
    "all in all , a key step in the heuristic is finding the mdi map @xmath3 of each @xmath4 . since this task is not trivial , @xcite present two algorithms , called methods a and b , for efficiently deriving @xmath3 from @xmath4 .",
    "methods a and b are claimed to be correct although no proof is provided ( a proof is just sketched ) . in this paper , we show that methods a and b are not correct and propose a correction of them .    as said , we are not the first to study the problem of finding the consensus dag .",
    "in addition to the works discussed above by @xcite and @xcite , some other works devoted to this problem are @xcite .",
    "we elaborate below on the differences between these works and ours . @xcite",
    "propose to adapt existing score - based algorithms for learning dags from data to the case where the learning data is replaced by the bns provided by some experts .",
    "their approach suffers the problem pointed out by @xcite , because it consists essentially in learning a consensus dag from a combination of the given bns .",
    "a somehow related approach is proposed by @xcite .",
    "specifically , they propose a bayesian approach to learning dags from data , where the prior probability distribution over dags is constructed from the dags provided by some experts .",
    "since their approach requires data and does not combine the given dags into a single dag , it addresses a problem rather different from the one in this paper .",
    "moreover , the construction of the prior probability distribution over dags ignores the fact that some given dags may be different but equivalent .",
    "that is , unlike in the present work , a dag is not interpreted as inducing an independence model .",
    "a work that is relatively close to ours is that by @xcite .",
    "specifically , they show how to construct a mdi map of the intersection and union of the independence models induced by the dags provided by some experts .",
    "however , there are three main differences between their work and ours . first , unlike us",
    ", they do not assume that the given dags are defined over the same set of nodes .",
    "second , unlike us , they assume that there exists a node ordering that is consistent with all the given dags .",
    "third , their goal is to find a mdi map whereas ours is to find the mdi map that has the fewest parameters associated among all the mdi maps , i.e. the consensus dag .",
    "finally , @xcite develop a general framework to construct the consensus dag gradually .",
    "their framework is general in the sense that it is not tailored to any particular definition of consensus dag .",
    "instead , it relies upon a score to be defined by the user and that each expert will use to score different extensions to the current partial consensus dag .",
    "the individual scores are then combined to choose the extension to perform .",
    "unfortunately , we do not see how this framework could be applied to our definition of consensus dag .",
    "specifically , we do not see how each expert could score the extensions independently of the other experts , what the score would look like , or how the scores would be combined .",
    "it is worth recalling that this paper deals with the combination of probability distributions expressed as bns .",
    "those readers interested in the combination of probability distributions expressed in non - graphical numerical forms are referred to , for instance , @xcite .",
    "note also that we are interested in the combination before any data is observed .",
    "those readers interested in the combination after some data has been observed and each expert has updated her beliefs accordingly are referred to , for instance , @xcite . finally , note also that we aim at combining the given dags into a dag , the consensus dag .",
    "those readers interested in finding not a dag but graphical features ( e.g. arcs or paths ) all or a significant number of experts agree upon may want to consult @xcite , since these works deal with a similar problem .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by reviewing some preliminary concepts in section [ sec : preliminaries ] .",
    "we analyze the complexity of finding the consensus dag in section [ sec : np - hard ] .",
    "we discuss the heuristic for finding an approximated consensus dag in more detail in section [ sec : heuristic ] .",
    "we introduce methods a and b in section [ sec : methodsab ] and show that they are not correct .",
    "we correct them in section [ sec : correctness ] .",
    "we analyze the complexity of the corrected methods a and b in section [ sec : efficiency ] and show that they are more efficient than any other approach we can think of to solve the same problem .",
    "we close with some discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section , we review some concepts used in this paper .",
    "all the dags , probability distributions and independence models in this paper are defined over @xmath6 , unless otherwise stated . if @xmath7 is in a dag @xmath8",

    "the _ length _ of a route is the number of ( not necessarily distinct ) arcs in the route .",

    ", then @xmath10 is called a _ descendant _ of @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath9 is a descendant of itself , since we allow routes of length zero . given a subset @xmath12",

    "given a route @xmath15 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath8 and a route @xmath16 between @xmath10 and @xmath17 in @xmath8 , @xmath18 denotes the route between @xmath9 and @xmath17 in @xmath8 resulting from appending @xmath16 to @xmath15 .",

    "we say that a node @xmath17 is a _ collider _ in a route in a dag if there exist two nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath23 is a subroute of the route .",
