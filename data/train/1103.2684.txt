    "<S> ( [ orbital2 ] ) and ( [ gpansatz ] ) essentially coincide with the respective orbital of isotropic systems .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ summary - and - outlook . ] ] summary and outlook .    </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the stability under rotation of attractive ultracold bose gases , confined by an isotropic as well as a slightly anisotropic harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> the problem has been mapped to and calculated in the corotating frame . </S>",
    "<S> both many - body and gross - pitaevskii approaches revealed that the rotation does not affect the stability of the gas against the collapse . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the maximum value of the interaction strength @xmath69 where the attractive gas collapses remains essentially unchanged as the rotation frequency @xmath11 varies within the extreme values @xmath73 and @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the frequency of the trap in the direction of the weakest confinement .    we have found here on both the mb and the gp ( mf ) levels that the ground state of the rotating attractive system carries zero ( or almost zero in the anisotropic case ) angular momentum for the whole range of the allowed values of @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> obviously , no vortex states are created . in the mb treatment </S>",
    "<S> , this means that no transition between lll states of different angular symmetries has been found for the rotating attractive system . in the gp ( mf ) </S>",
    "<S> analysis this means that no symmetry broken states were found to be energetically favorable as the rotation frequency @xmath11 increases from @xmath73 to @xmath75 . in both mb and gp approaches , </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the ground state remains practically unchanged and the attractive gas is condensed in the nodeless s - orbital as the rotation frequency increases . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the gp description agrees well with the mb computation . </S>",
    "<S> these results conflict the findings of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we revisited then the problem using the ansatz that incorporates a ` quadrupolar flow ' term , used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy and stability of the system were again found not to be affected by the rotation of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of this discrepancy lies in a sign error in the expectation value of the hamiltonian of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which leads to a qualitatively different behavior of the properties of the system as a function of the rotation frequency @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in agreement with findings in the literature for isotropic harmonic ( see @xcite ) and isotropic anharmonic traps with slight anharmonicity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we should , finally , stress that the present variational approach to the stationary ground state is not an extensive study of the rotating attractive gas . even though we can rule out the stability - enhancement of the stationary ground state and the vortex nucleation in the attractive gas rotating with a frequency @xmath11 smaller than the resonance frequency @xmath75 , there is more physics beyond that . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the stability of low - lying excited states with nonzero total angular momentum is expected to depend on @xmath11 .  . </S>",
    "<S> ] we have shown elsewhere @xcite that ground states with @xmath161 are generally fragmented states and thus more stable against collapse . a ground state with @xmath162 </S>",
    "<S> will not couple to the external rotation and hence the ground - state symmetry will not change as @xmath11 increases . on the other hand , a ground state initially with nonzero @xmath163 _ will be _ affected by the rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the critical parameter @xmath69 in that case could increase as a function of @xmath11 , before the latter reaches the extreme value @xmath75 , and this will further stabilize the rotating @xmath164 state against collapse . </S>",
    "<S> it is still to be investigated whether and for which parameters values crossings of energy levels and symmetry changing of the ( noncollapsed ) rotating ground - state might occur . </S>",
    "<S> last , based on the found absence of symmetry breaking of the ground state in the examined region @xmath165 and the divergence of the energy and angular momentum for @xmath166 , we may speculate that , in the rotating attractive gas a vortex ground state  if at all can exist  may only appear as a giant - vortex ( i.e. , a single vortex at the center of the trap whose radius and vorticity are increasing functions of time ) and this only for rotation with frequency @xmath166 . a time - dependent many - body treatment , for instance using the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree for bosons ( mctdhb ) method @xcite that has described successfully many - body dynamics of attractive becs @xcite , should shed light on this interesting problem and uncover the response mechanisms of attractive gases to rotations .    </S>",
