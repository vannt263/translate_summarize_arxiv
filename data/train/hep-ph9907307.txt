    "the qualitative feature that @xmath2 is one of the oldest problems in kaon decays that is not fully understood qualitatively .",

    "experimentally we have @xmath5 , the precise definition used here can be found in @xcite and a review of kaon physics is in @xcite more references can be found in either of these two .    the underlying standard model process is the exchange of a @xmath6-boson but due to the large difference in the kaon and @xmath6-mass very large corrections can come into play and even normally suppressed contributions can be enhanced by large factors @xmath7 . at the same time , at low energies the strong interaction coupling @xmath8 becomes very large which requires us to use non - perturbative methods at those scales .",
    "the resummation of large logarithms at short - distance can be done using renormalization group methods . at a high scale",
    "the exchange of @xmath6-bosons is replaced by a sum over local operators . for weak",
    "decays these start at dimension 6 .",
    "the scale can then be lowered using the renormalization group .",
    "the short - distance running is now known to two - loops @xcite ( nlo ) which sums the @xmath9 and @xmath10 terms .",
    "a review of this can be found in the lectures by a. buras @xcite .",
    "the major remaining problem is to calculate the matrix elements of the local operators at some low scale .",

    "various improvements have since been introduced .",
    "the correct momentum routing was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the use of the extended nambu - jona - lasinio model as an improved low energy model was introduced for weak matrix elements in @xcite and a short discussion of its major advantages and disadvantages can be found in @xcite .",
    "the results obtained were encouraging but a major problem remained . at nlo order",
    "the short - distance running becomes dependent on the precise definition of the local operators .",
    "this dependence should also be reflected in the calculations of the matrix elements as well as a correct identification of the scale of the renormalization group in the matrix element calculation .",
    "the more precise interpretation of the scheme of @xcite introduced in @xcite was shown there at one - loop to satisfy the latter criterion . here",
    "i present in the next section how this method also satisfies the latter at nlo and how it solves the first problem as well .",
    "we call this method the @xmath12-boson method",
    ". the third section describes the numerical results we obtained in @xcite",
    ".    other recent work on matrix elements is the work of @xcite and @xcite using the @xmath11 method as well .",
    "a more model dependent approach is @xcite .",
    "the basic underlying idea is that we know how to hadronize currents or at least that this is a tractable problem .",
    "so we replace the effect of the local operators of @xmath13 at a scale @xmath14 by the exchange of a series of colourless @xmath12-bosons at a low scale @xmath14 .",
    "the scale @xmath14 should be such that the @xmath11 suppressed contributions have no longer large logarithmic corrections .",
    "let me illustrate the procedure in a simpler case of only one operator and neglecting penguin contributions . in the more general case all coefficients become matrices .",

    "we now determine @xmath16 , @xmath17 as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "this is done by equalizing matrix elements of @xmath19 with the equivalent ones of @xmath12-boson exchange .",
    "the matrix elements are at the scale @xmath14 chosen such that perturbative qcd methods can still be used and thus we can use external states of quarks and gluons .",

    "the right - hand - side can be calculated in a very different renormalization scheme from the lhs .",
    "the infrared dependence of @xmath23 is present in precisely the same way in @xmath24 such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are scheme - independent and independent of the precise infrared definition of the external state in fig .",

    "one step remains , we now have to calculate the matrix element of @xmath12-boson exchange between meson external states .",

    "the first term we have to evaluate in a low - energy model with as much qcd input as possible .",
    "the @xmath27 dependence cancels between the two terms in ( [ split ] ) if the low - energy model is good enough and all dependence on @xmath28 cancels out to the order required as well . calculating the coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath29 gives the required correction to the naive factorization method as used in previous @xmath11 calculations .    it should be stressed that in the end all dependence on @xmath30 cancels out .",
    "the @xmath12-boson is a purely technical device to correctly identify the four - quark operators in terms of well - defined products of nonlocal currents .",
    "we now use the @xmath12-boson method with @xmath23 as given in @xcite and @xmath31 , the calculation of the latter is in progress , and @xmath32 . for @xmath33 we can extrapolate to the pole for the real case ( @xmath34 ) and in the chiral limit ( @xmath35 ) and for @xmath0 we can get at the values of the octet ( @xmath36 ) , weak mass term ( @xmath37 ) and 27-plet ( @xmath38 ) coupling .",
