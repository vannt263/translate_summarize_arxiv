    "infrared ( ir ) observations of supernova remnants ( snrs ) primarily reveal the thermal continuum emission of shock - heated dust ( dwek & arendt 1992 ; and references therein ) . for most remnants ,",
    "this dust is typical interstellar dust that has been swept up in the expanding supernova blast wave .",
    "only the very youngest snrs offer the possibility of observing dust that has formed from the metal - enriched ejecta of the supernova itself , before it is dispersed and mixed into the general ism .",
    "the dust content of snrs is not directly observable in any other wavelength regime .",
    "the ir portion of the spectrum also contains ground - state fine - structure lines from neutral to moderately ionized species of atoms from carbon to nickel .",
    "observations of these fine structure lines offer the capability of probing density and temperature regimes not represented by the commonly observed optical transitions .",
    "another distinct advantage of ir observations is that extinction is much lower at ir than optical or uv wavelengths .    the earliest airborne and ground based searches for ir emission from the cas a supernova remnant ( snr ) only managed to set upper limits on the intensity of the ir emission ( wright et al .",
    "1980 , dinerstein et al .",
    "observations with the _ iras _ satellite , launched in 1983 , provided the first clear detection of cas a at ir wavelengths .",
    "these measurements of the mid - ir emission in broad bands at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath0 enabled several detailed investigations into the nature of the heating mechanism of the dust within the remnant ( dwek et al .",
    "1987a , braun 1987 ) .",
    "however the _ iras _ data lacked the spatial resolution to reveal more than the gross distribution of dust within the snr .",
    "the _ iras _ data also lacked the spectral resolution needed to determine the amount of line emission that might be contributing in the mid - ir .",
    "subsequent observations by ( dinerstein et al .",
    "1987 ) detected weak line emission of [ s iv ] at 10.4 @xmath0 .",
    "greidanus & strom ( 1991 ) made a higher resolution ground - based map of the northern part of the remnant at 20 @xmath0 .",
    "this map reveals clumpy ir emission that does not appear to be strongly correlated with either the optical or x - ray emission . with the advent of the _ iso _ , ir observations with high spatial and spectral resolution are available .",
    "an isocam map of cas a at 10.7  12 @xmath0 ( lagage et al .",
    "1996 ) shows emission that is distributed in a manner similar to the de - extincted x - ray emission , or the radio emission .",
    "much of the brightest emission correlates with line emission from high velocity ejecta within the snr , leading lagage et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to propose that the observed emission arises from dust that has formed in the knots of supernova ejecta , and is now being heated as the knots are evaporating into the hot gas of the supernova blast wave ( dwek & werner 1981 ) .    in this paper",

    "background emission in the spectra is apparently very weak and thus has not been subtracted for any of the spectra shown here .",

    "1998 ) , the strongest background component at mid - ir wavelengths , indicates that this emission from local interplanetary dust should contribute less than 0.25 jy at 25 @xmath0 in the sws aperture .",
    "similarly , the data have not been corrected for extinction . using either the mathis ( 1990 ) extinction law or that calculated by drain & lee ( 1984 ) , and the visual extinction estimate of @xmath5 = 4.3 mag ( searle 1971 ) , the largest extinction in the mid - ir should be @xmath6 , found at the wavelength of the 10 @xmath0 silicate feature .",
    "this amount of extinction would reduce the observed intensities by @xmath7 at @xmath8 @xmath0 . at other wavelengths",
    "the extinction generally reduces the observed intensities by less than 10 % .",
    "correction for this would have little effect on the results presented here , and would introduce additional sources of error related to the accuracy of the @xmath9-band extinction and its extrapolation to ir wavelengths , and the uniformity of extinction across the remnant .",
    "we had previously obtained spectra of cas a at three locations using the kao ( moseley et al .",
    "these data cover a smaller wavelength range at lower resolution than the sws data .",
    "therefore , their main utility is to provide confirmation of the spectral features and relative calibration of the sws data .",
    "the highest quality kao data were obtained at a location roughly matching that of region n1 .",
    "the other observed locations , at regions s1 and at the optically bright filament 1 of baade & minkowski ( 1954 ) , showed no detectable emission .",
    "selected portions of the sws spectra of the ten observed fields are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the panels in each row of figure 1 , cover a wavelength range of exactly @xmath10 centered on the rest wavelength of a particular fine structure transition .",
    "each row is selected to cover the region of a different transition . in this depiction",
    ", different transitions observed at the same radial velocity in a given field should be aligned in each column .",
    "the most prominent line in the spectra is the [ o iv ] 25.89 @xmath0 line ( seventh row of fig .",

    ", this line falls in a region where the sws sensitivity is good .",

    "1980 ) , yielding @xmath72 m@xmath73 of dust in the region .",
    "comparison to the mass of the gas in region n3 ( table 3 ) suggests that as much as 2% of the si ejecta in the fmks has been condensed into dust assuming that mg protosilicate is @xmath74 si by mass , and all the si is traced by the observed dust and [ si ii ] emission .",
    "the total mass of hot dust in the snr can be roughly estimated by scaling this dust mass by the ratio of the total flux density of cas a to the flux density of this region . with a total flux density from _ iras _ observations of @xmath75 jy ( arendt 1989 ) at 25 @xmath0",
    ", we estimate that cas a contains @xmath76 m@xmath73 of hot dust .",
    "the mass derived here is a factor of 10  100 lower than previous estimates of @xmath77 m@xmath73 based on _ iras _ observations ( mezger et al .",
    "1986 ; braun 1987 ; dwek et al .",
    "1987a ; greidanus & strom , 1991 ; saken , fesen & shull 1992 ) .",
    "there are two reasons why our dust mass estimate is lower .",
    "first , the mass absorption coefficient for mg protosilicate is about a factor of 2 larger than that applied in the other studies .",
    "second and more importantly , the dust temperature we find is significantly higher than those estimated from the _ iras _ observations .",
    "part of this difference is the high temperature implied when fitting the data with mg protosilicate emissivity ( cf . figs . 3 and 4_c",
    "_ ) , and part of the difference is that the sws data do not include the 60 and 100 @xmath0 and are therefore insensitive to the presence of cooler dust grains in the fmks or elsewhere in the snr .",
    "the apparent excess of 60 and 100 @xmath0 emission in figure 3 suggests the presence of a second , cooler dust component in the cas a snr .",
    "a fit to the 60 and 100 @xmath0 flux densities only gives a dust temperature of 52 k ( arendt 1989 ) , and a resulting cool dust mass of @xmath78 m@xmath73 for the entire snr .",
    "( note that masses quoted by arendt 1989 are too large by a factor of @xmath79 . )",
    "the 25 @xmath0 emission of this cooler dust would be @xmath80 jy or @xmath81 of the total emission .",
    "this contribution would not greatly alter the spectral fitting discussed previously .      the collisional heating rate for a dust grain of radius @xmath82 ( in cm ) is given by ( dwek 1987 ) : @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are the electron mass , number density , and temperature , and @xmath87 is a grain heating efficiency , which approaches a value of @xmath88 for larger grains and lower temperatures .",
    "the radiative heating rate of the same dust grain can be expressed as : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the radiative energy density and @xmath91 denotes the spectrally averaged absorption coefficient . in the region immediately behind a shock passing through a fmk , we can approximate the energy density as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a mean scale length of the emitting region ( e.g. the cooling length of the shock ) , and @xmath94 is the cooling function of the shocked gas in units of erg cm@xmath1 s@xmath2 . the ratio of these heating rates is thus @xmath96 the sum of these heating rates will be equal to the grain cooling rate or luminosity : @xmath97 where @xmath65 is the dust temperature , and @xmath98 is the dust absorption coefficient averaged over a planck spectrum of temperate @xmath65 .    equating the grain heating and cooling rates , we can solve for the grain temperature given estimates to the gas temperature , density , and cooling function .",
    "sutherland & dopita ( 1995 ) present models of the structure and emission from shocked knots of o - rich ejecta .",
    "hurford & fesen ( 1996 ) suggest that these models with cloud shock velocities of @xmath99 km s@xmath2 may be appropriate for the cas a fmks , if the extinction is @xmath100 mag greater than the commonly adopted @xmath101 mag ( searle 1971 ) .",
    "thus , the 200 km s@xmath2 shock model of sutherland & dopita ( 1995 ) estimates a postshock temperature of @xmath102 k , @xmath103 @xmath47 , and @xmath104 erg cm@xmath1 s@xmath2 . for these conditions , collisional heating dominates radiative heating by factors of several hundred , and the dust temperature is given by @xmath105^{1/4}.\\ ] ] for silicate grains with @xmath106 k , @xmath107 ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "approximating @xmath108 , the estimated temperature for @xmath82 = 0.01 @xmath0 grains will be @xmath109 k. larger grains will be correspondingly cooler .",
    "this simple calculation shows that the high dust temperature indicated by the continuum spectrum of cas a is consistent with emission from collisionally heated dust in the post shock region of fmks , but not with radiatively heated dust in the fmks .",
    "note that the collisional heating mechanism is only tenable if the electron temperature equilibrates with the ion temperature as in the models presented by sutherland & and dopita ( 1995 ) , in contrast to some of the pure oxygen shock models calculated by itoh ( 1988 ) where electron temperatures only reach @xmath110 k.    in region n3 , the integrated flux of thermal emission from the hot dust is @xmath111 times the total flux in ir , optical , and uv lines , assuming that hurford & fesen ( 1996 ) fmk5 corresponds to the observed knot , and that the spectrum of sutherland & dopita s osp200 is a reasonable estimate of the uv line intensities .",
    "this suggests that thermal radiation from collisionally heated dust is the most important cooling mechanism for the shocked fmks , in agreement with the more general comparison of the relative importance of x - ray and ir cooling found by dwek et al .",
    "( 1987b ) for various snrs .    while the hot dust appears to be associated with the fmks , the location of the cooler dust producing the 60 and 100 @xmath0 emission is not as clear . if the cooler dust component is also associated with the fmks , it could be dust within the unshocked ( or cooled post - shock ) volume of the fmks . in a cooler environment ,",
    "collisional heating of the dust may no longer be significant , but the radiation of the shock passing through a typical fmk may be sufficient to heat nearby dust to the required temperature of @xmath112 k. in this case , the ratio of the mass of hot dust to the mass of cool dust ( @xmath113 ) will be equal to the fraction of the fmk mass that is contained within the hot post - shock region .",
    "however , the global 60 and 100 @xmath0 emission depicted in fig .",
    "3 may not originate in the fmks .",
    "it may be emitted by dust in the x - ray emitting gas between and around the fmks .",
    "a dust temperature of @xmath114 k would then imply electron densities of @xmath100 @xmath47 if the dust grains have radii of @xmath115 @xmath0 ( dwek 1987 ) .",
    "higher electron densities would be required if the grains are larger .",
    "this derived density is not atypical for snrs , but is somewhat low compared to some recent estimates of the density , @xmath116 @xmath47 s , derived from the x - ray observations of cas a ( holt et al . 1994 ; vink , kaastra , & bleeker 1996 ; favata et al . 1997 ) .      in the previous sections ,",
    "the correlation of the continuum emission with the line emission of the fmks is taken as evidence for dust radiating at equilibrium temperatures of @xmath3 170 k and collisionally heated by the shocked fmk gas .",
    "the composition of the dust appears to reinforce this conclusion .",
    "however , an alternate model for the strength and morphology of the continuum emission can be constructed , assuming that the bulk of the dust is embedded in within the x - ray emitting gas rather than the fmks . in this case , as _ iras _ observations had indicated , most of the dust is collisionally heated to temperatures of @xmath117 k in the hot x - ray emitting portion of the snr .",
    "then in regions where the fmks are plowing into the reverse shock , the bowshocks of the knots compress the gas which will increase the dust temperatures and the spatial density of dust grains ( sutherland & dopita 1995 ) . however , this environment is at a significantly lower density than the material of the fmks .",
    "therefore , if the dust grains are small enough they will be stochastically heated , i.e. the grain cooling time will be shorter than the collision time , and the grain temperatures will fluctuate instead of remaining at equilibrium temperatures . from the work of dwek ( 1986 ) , we see that silicate grains with radii of @xmath118 @xmath0 immersed in a gas with @xmath119 cm@xmath2 and @xmath121 k will have dust temperatures @xmath122 k. the presence of the colder grains leads to additional emission at longer wavelengths . for the example chosen here , this improves the fit between the model and the sws and kao data ( dashed line in fig .",
    "3 ) .    while dust heated in the bow shocks of the fmks may be responsible for the correlation of the optical fmks with the brightest emission in the 11.3 @xmath0 image ( lagage et al .",
    "1996 ) , the fainter diffuse emission that forms a nearly complete shell correlates fairly well with both x - ray and radio emission ( e.g. anderson & rudnick 1995 ) .",
    "this shell would be emission from stochastically heated dust grains in the lower density x - ray emitting gas .",
    "in addition , the shell could contain significant synchrotron emission , depending on the actual shape of the extension of the radio synchrotron spectrum into the ir regime ( e.g. mezger et al .",
    "1986 ; dwek et al .",
    "1987a ; tuffs et al .",
    "the morphology of the x - ray and radio emission are similar after correction for extinction ( keohane , rudnick & anderson 1996 ; keohane , gotthelf , & petre 1998 ) , making it difficult to distinguish thermal from synchrotron emission by the apparent structure .",
    "on a large scale , the cas a snr gives the impression of a star that has been dissected by layers .",
    "first , most of the h- and n - rich outer layers are lost in winds prior to the sn explosion , leading to the qsfs ( van den bergh 1971 ; peimbert & van den bergh 1971 ) .",
    "then , in the sn explosion , the outermost layer of the star is blasted away at the highest velocity , producing the n - rich fmfs ( fesen , becker , & blair 1987 ; fesen , becker , & goodrich 1988 ) .",
    "inner layers of the star produce the fmks , some of which are mainly oxygen , and others , from deeper layers of the star , contaminated with o - burning products ( si , ar , ca ) ( chevalier & kirshner 1979 ; winkler , roberts , & kirshner 1991 ) . all of these knots of ejecta are rendered visible when they are shocked in the expanding shell of the snr blast wave .",
    "the qsfs are caught by the shell , at the forward shock ; the fast - moving knots and flocculi catch the decelerating shell from the inside , at the reverse shock .    within this framework",
    ", the lack of [ ar ii ] emission from the south regions (  3.1 ) suggests that the material in this region originated in layers of the star above the o - burning zone .",
    "the observed ejecta is presumably trailed by ejecta enriched with o - burning products which has yet to catch up with the reverse shock because either the knots have lower velocities or the reverse shock is located at a larger radius than in the northern portion of the snr .",
    "additional suggestions of a lack of mixing in the sn ejecta are provided by the composition of the dust , discussed below .    despite the large scale differentiation of the ejecta , evidence for partial mixing of the ejecta",
    "is provided by the observation of [ fe ii ] and [ ni ii ] in optical spectra of fmks ( e.g. winkler , roberts , & kirshner 1991 ) , and now by the detection of ir lines of both ne and ar in the fmk spectra in the north regions of the snr ( lagage et al . 1996 ; tuffs et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the argon , iron , and nickel originate in layers of the progenitor that lie below the oxygen - burning shell , whereas the neon is found in layers above the oxygen - burning shell ( weaver , zimmerman & woosley 1978 ; woosley , axelrod , & weaver 1984 ; johnston & yahil 1984 ) .",
    "since the cas a snr is still sweeping up the circumstellar material shed by its progenitor , the dust in the snr must be relatively recently formed either in the pre - sn stellar wind , or from the ejecta of the sn itself .",
    "the correlation of the continuum intensity with the o and ar line strengths of the fmks suggest that the observed dust has formed from the ejecta . in  3.2 , we found that the continuum spectrum is well represented by dust with optical properties similar to those the mg protosilicates measured in the lab by dorschner et al .",
    "we favor the mg over the ca and fe protosilicates because of the good match to the position and width of the 22 @xmath0 emission feature , and because the mg abundance should exceed the ca and fe abundances in the o - rich layers of evolved massive stars ( weaver et al .",
    "1978 ; woosley et al .",
    "1984 ) , with no mixing of the ejecta required .",
    "similar mixing considerations have led clayton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to propose that type x sic grains found in meteorites must originate in type ia sne , rather than type ib or ii sne as cas a is generally believed to be .",
    "we also favor the mg protosilicate identification of the dust over the possibility of feo dust , because while feo dust could create the 22 @xmath0 feature , its spectrum drops quickly at @xmath123 @xmath0 and would still require another dust component to provide the longer wavelength emission seen in the sws spectra and in the _ iras _ data . finally , the 400 k dust temperatures required for the feo grains is higher that we expect to find in the snr at this time .",
    "the apparent presence of mg protosilicates does not preclude the presence of carbonaceous dust which may have formed in the ejecta .",
    "the fate of c in the cas a ejecta is difficult to determine .",
    "normally strong c lines are obscured by high extinction at uv wavelengths , optical lines are weak ( hurford & fesen 1996 ) , and no c lines are present in the spectral range of the sws . if the carbon is locked up in graphitic dust , its ir spectrum will lack any distinctive features in contrast to the strong spectral features of silicate grains .",
    "the composition of the dust required to explain the 60 and 100 @xmath0 emission seen by the iras is unconstrained by the broadband observations .",
    "this dust component could be either additional silicate dust or carbonaceous dust since only a fraction of the carbon in the ejecta is expected to be locked up in co molecules ( clayton , liu , & dalgarno 1998 ) .",
    "the _ iso _ sws data have allowed a detailed look at the line and continuum emission from the cas a snr .",
    "the data provide new information on the composition of both the gas and dust in the supernova ejecta .",
    "the line emission is dominated by [ o iv ] 25.89 @xmath0 , which is not surprising for this prototype of oxygen - rich snrs .",
    "emission from oxygen - burning products , particularly [ ar ii ] 7.99 @xmath0 , is also strong in some regions of the snr .",
    "the dust composition revealed by these data clearly show that the dust formed in the ejecta differs from typical interstellar silicates .",
    "a mg protosilicate composition is suggested for the recently formed dust .",
    "the mass of the hot dust observed appears to be a small fraction of the condensible silicon .",
    "however , a cooler dust component is also present in the snr , though not necessarily associated with the fmks .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , the sws data do not provide evidence for emission from iron in the sn ejecta , in either the gas phase or the dust .",
    "another unresolved question concerns the apparent morphological differences that are implied between the @xmath124 @xmath0 emission observed with the sws and previous _ iras _ and ground - based studies ( dwek et al . 1987a ; greidanus & strom 1991 ) .",
