    "for out of equilibrium situations , the only known formalism for perturbative calculations of green functions is the complex - time - path ( ctp ) formalism ( or keldysh formalism ) @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the thermal equilibrium case where there exists several formalisms which are completely equivalent ( imaginary - time ( it ) @xcite , real - time @xmath0 @xcite , retarded - advanced ( @xmath1 ) @xcite , keldysh @xcite )    in a series of papers @xcite , carrington and collaborators have gained experience in the keldysh formalism for 2-point , 3-point , 4-point functions in thermal equilibrium , together with some generalization to non - equilibrium situations .",
    "the keldysh formalism is very opaque , and it is so cumbersome that a mathematica program @xcite has to be used to write down one - loop diagrams integrands .    in the paper `` four - point",

    "ii ) how is it compatible with the ward identities for this 2-photon-2-fermion amplitude , which relate 4-point to 3-point , as well as 3-point to the 2-point keldysh fermion self - energy ?    in thermal equilibrium , the equivalence between the three real - time formalisms arises in perturbation theory from the existence of bogoliubov - like transformations between the three bases @xmath0 , @xmath1 , keldysh @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the one - loop qed case in order to establish the relations between the 3-point and 4-point qed keldysh amplitudes and the @xmath1 amplitudes .",
    "those are general relations and they have to be satisfied in this simple example . moreover , the @xmath1 amplitudes are well specified analytical continuations of the it amplitudes .",
    "a nice outcome is that the relation provides an interesting interpretation of the keldysh amplitudes in terms of discontinuity in an external energy ( i.e. in terms of cut diagrams ) .",
    "this interpretation is generally valid in thermal equilibrium .",

    "this paper stays in the framework defined by the authors of ref.@xcite for their proof of the ward identities in the non - equilibrium case : + i ) the out - of - equilibrium case is perturbative , i.e. bare massless particles have out - of - local - equilibrium distribution functions @xmath5 instead of the thermal ones @xmath6 , + ii ) the `` hard - loop '' qed approximation is restricted to the factor that involves the @xmath7 matrices , i.e. in this factor : a ) neglect all external momenta compared to the loop momentum @xmath8 , b ) ignore factors of @xmath9 .",

    "they just involve different analytical continuations : i ) retarded functions are related to retarded ones , ii ) a discontinuity in one energy variable is related to a discontinuity in the same variable , with the same weight .",

    "it is shown in the appendix that the addition of the two diagrams is incorrectly performed in ref.@xcite , so that four , out of the seven ward identities written for the full amplitude , have to be corrected .",

    "the easiest basis is the retarded - advanced basis . for @xmath92 ,",
    "there are the 3 retarded functions ( the advanced ones are their complex conjugate , i.e. they are not independent functions ) . for @xmath360 , there are 4 retarded ones , and 3 bi - retarded functions . out of equilibrium , in the keldysh basis , the retarded amplitudes belong to the basis .",
    "the interpretation of the other members of the basis has remained obscure .",
    "this work has established the general relation that exists in thermal equilibrium between 3-point and 4-point 1pi functions of the keldysh basis and analytical continuations of the corresponding imaginary - time ( it ) amplitudes .",
    "the intermediary has been the functions of the retarded - advanced basis , where a well defined prescription exists for the weight to be attributed to the many possible analytical continuations of the it amplitude .",
    "the relation has emphasized that a set of functions that are particular to the keldysh basis ( set ii ) , has to be interpreted in terms of discontinuity in energy in specific channels of the amplitude . as usual , a discontinuity in a given channel is associated with a process where particles are on - shell in a possible intermediate state of that channel . in other terms , the diagram is cut into two pieces .",
    "a characteristic property of those keldysh amplitudes is that the intermediate states weight differs from the weight as it appears in the retarded amplitudes . indeed , for a bosonic state , it is `` emission@xmath88absorption '' instead of `` emission@xmath87absorption '' ( and the reverse for a fermionic state ) .",
    "the nice property of these features is that they are expressed in a form that should carry over to the perturbative out - of - local - equilibrium case .",

    "indeed , those 1pi amplitudes properties are likely to be a consequence of the following result .",
    "the ( connected+disconnected ) green functions in the keldysh basis have been generally shown by chou et al @xcite to be an expectation value of time - ordered nested commutators and anticommutators .    in more precise terms , the external momenta @xmath361 have to be either of type @xmath362 or of type @xmath363 .",

    "the amplitudes that belong to set ii have two legs of type @xmath31 , @xmath364 , and they are a sum of discontinuities in one energy variable ( i.e. in one channel ) .",

    "+ the qed ward identities relate functions which belong to the same set .",
    "diagramatic rules allow one to write down the loop s integrands .",
    "there are , in the keldysh basis , other functions in addition to the sets i and ii . in the 3-point case",
    ", one function belongs to set iii , while four do in the 4-point case .",
    "a general result is that set iii contains a double discontinuity ( i.e. diagram cut into three pieces ) .",
    "a pattern emerges for the keldysh basis , in momentum space .",
