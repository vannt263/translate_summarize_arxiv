    "the conversion of one type of wave mode into another type of mode at resonance points in inhomogeneous plasmas and the associated irreversible transfer of wave energy to the mode conversion region are important and extensively - studied phenomena in both space and laboratory plasmas.@xcite there exists a vast literature on a large number of mode conversion phenomena involving many different wave modes , which we will not attempt to review here.@xcite since mode conversion is associated with the singularity of wave functions , theoretical studies encounter great difficulties and often adopt some kind of approximate methods such as the wkb method . in complicated cases where",
    "plasma waves are strongly coupled , these approximate methods are often unable to produce sufficiently accurate results",
    ". therefore development of a theoretical method that allows _ exact _ solutions to mode conversion problems will be of great value in the study of inhomogeneous plasmas .    in this paper and",
    "a series of companion papers to be published later , we will develop an exact theory of mode conversion based on a new version of the invariant imbedding method ( iim ) for wave propagation in arbitrarily - inhomogeneous stratified media .",
    "the main idea of the iim is to transform the original boundary value problem of wave equations , which are second - order differential equations , to an initial value problem of coupled first - order ordinary differential equations for the reflection and transmission coefficients and the field amplitudes.@xcite these equations are called the invariant imbedding equations and the independent variable , which is usually the thickness of inhomogeneous media , is called the imbedding parameter .",
    "this transformation makes the numerical solution of wave equations much easier .",
    "our iim utilizes a rigorous integral representation of wave equations and differs substantially from the better - known iim presented in ref .",
    "29.@xcite more specifically , our method gives the invariant imbedding equations with nonsingular coefficients even in the cases where the material parameters change discontinuously at some discrete points inside the inhomogeneous medium , unlike the imbedding equations derived in ref .",
    "when the inhomogeneity is one - dimensional , which is the case in stratified media , our method can be used to obtain exact solutions for the reflection and transmission coefficients and the electric and magnetic field amplitudes inside arbitrarily - inhomogeneous media . when the inhomogeneity is random , it can be used to obtain the exact disorder - averaged reflection and transmission coefficients and field amplitudes.@xcite our method can also be used to study the propagation of several coupled waves in both linear and nonlinear media in an exact manner.@xcite    in this paper , we apply our iim to the mode conversion of the simplest kind , that is the conversion and resonant absorption of obliquely - incident @xmath0-polarized electromagnetic waves into electrostatic modes in cold , unmagnetized plasmas.@xcite when a @xmath0 wave of frequency @xmath1 enters a stratified plasma with a monotonically - increasing density profile at an incident angle @xmath2 , it propagates first to the cutoff point where the local plasma frequency @xmath3 equals @xmath4 and is partially reflected .",
    "some fraction of the wave then tunnels to the mode conversion point where @xmath3 is equal to @xmath1 and is converted to electrostatic modes . since the generation of electrostatic modes requires the electric field component in the direction of inhomogeneity , only obliquely - incident @xmath0 waves can produce mode conversion in unmagnetized plasmas .",
    "mode conversion in unmagnetized plasmas has been studied extensively over many decades and a detailed review of the literature can be found in ref .  25 . in this paper , we restrict our attention to cold plasmas with zero temperature and postpone the discussion of finite temperature effects to future publications . though our method can be applied to stratified plasmas with arbitrary density profiles very easily , we consider only the cases with linear and parabolic density profiles in this paper .",
    "one of the main reasons why we revisit this well - studied problem is to establish the accuracy and efficiency of our method before applying it to more complicated mode conversion problems .    among a large number of references on the mode conversion in unmagnetized plasmas with a linear density profile in half- or entire space",
    ", we mention just two papers .",

    "<S> this is the first of a series of papers devoted to the development of the invariant imbedding theory of mode conversion in inhomogeneous plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> a new version of the invariant imbedding theory of wave propagation in inhomogeneous media allows one to solve a wide variety of coupled wave equations exactly and efficiently , even in the cases where the material parameters change discontinuously at the boundaries and inside the inhomogeneous medium . in this paper , the invariant imbedding method is applied to the mode conversion of the simplest kind , that is the conversion of @xmath0-polarized electromagnetic waves into electrostatic modes in cold , unmagnetized plasmas . the mode conversion coefficient and the field distribution </S>",
    "<S> are calculated exactly for linear and parabolic plasma density profiles and compared quantitatively with previous results . </S>"
