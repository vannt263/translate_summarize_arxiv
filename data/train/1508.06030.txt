    "holes in cubic semiconductors originate from atomic p - orbitals . therefore , the total angular momentum of a hole can take values @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "so the spin orbit split valence band consists of @xmath0 and @xmath1 subbands . in semiconductors with large fine structure",
    "the @xmath1 state is very high in energy and therefore is irrelevant .",
    "this is the case we consider here . following tradition in the field , below we call the angular momentum of the hole `` the effective spin '' and",
    "denote it by letter @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "studies of holes in cubic semiconductors have a long history .",
    "pioneering theoretical work belongs to luttinger who has applied the @xmath4 method and the group theory analysis for hole quantum states near bottom of the band at the @xmath5 point  @xcite .",
    "quadratic in momentum luttinger hamiltonian depends on luttinger parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian has a rotationally invariant part which is independent of the lattice orientation and it also contains a small correction which is related to the cubic lattice and which is not rotationally invariant . in the present work we neglect the small rotationally noninvariant correction and consider the rotationally invariant hamiltonian .    the hole binding in an acceptor level or in a quantum dot is a problem of a tremendous experimental interest .",
    "theoretically shallow acceptor levels have been studied thoroughly , from the spherical approximation  @xcite to accounting the lattice corrections  @xcite , spin orbit split valence band  @xcite , and so - called central cell correction  @xcite . as the acceptor spectrum is quite sensitive to variations of luttinger parameters ,",
    "the experimental data have been used to determine the parameters  @xcite .",
    "the hole spectrum of the spherically symmetric quantum dot with infinite walls has also been calculated  @xcite .",
    "zeeman splitting of acceptor levels in an external magnetic field has been also studied theoretically .",
    "the most detailed numerical calculation includes the rotationally invariant approximation , cubic lattice correction , and also higher order magnetic field corrections  @xcite .",
    "results of this calculation have been used in analysis of numerous experimental data , see also  @xcite .",
    "experimental data on the shallow acceptor spectrum in magnetic field have been obtained predominantly from infrared absorption spectroscopy for different acceptors in gaas  @xcite , ge  @xcite , si  @xcite and other semiconductors .",
    "we already pointed out above that in the present work we disregard the spin - orbit split @xmath1-band and limit our analysis by the rotationally invariant approximation in the luttinger hamiltonian .",
    "this implies that our analysis is applicable for gaas , inas , insb , and on the other hand the approximation is not justified in si .",
    "we calculate analytically g - factors of hole bound states for acceptors and spherically symmetric single hole quantum dots . at corresponding values of parameters our results are consistent with that of previous numerical computations for acceptors  @xcite .",
    "structure of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii we discuss the hamiltonian and approximations .",
    "in section iii we calculate energy levels and wave functions of a hole bound by a spherically symmetric potential .",
    "this section is very similar to the paper  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we present this section because of two reasons , ( i ) it introduces the method and the notations which we use in following sections .",
    "( ii ) we calculate previously unknown energy levels in a spherical parabolic quantum dot .",
    "section iv presents our main result , analytical calculation of zeeman splitting . in section",
    "v we specially consider the `` ultrarelativistic '' limit , the limit when mass of the heavy hole is diverging .",
    "section vi presents tables of g - factors , and our conclusions are summarized in section vii .",
    "algebra of tensor operators is described in appendix a , and the derivation of spin - orbit radial equations is given in appendix b.",
    "luttinger hamiltonian for @xmath6 free hole in a zinc - blende semiconductor reads  @xcite @xmath7 x , y , z are the crystal axes of the cubic lattice , @xmath8 is the quasi - momentum , @xmath9 is the electron mass , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are luttinger parameters , and @xmath13 denotes the anticommutator .",
    "this hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath14 where @xmath15 the irreducible 4th rank tensor @xmath16 depends on the orientation of the cubic lattice , the tensor is proportional to @xmath17 . since in the large spin - orbit splitting materials @xmath18 the rotationally noninvariant part of the hamiltonian can be neglected .",
    "hence the luttinger hamiltonian can be approximated by the following rotationally invariant ( independent of the lattice orientation ) hamiltonian @xmath19 since different components of momentum commute between themselves , @xmath20 can be rewritten as @xmath21 the @xmath22 term in ( [ lutsp ] ) represents the effective spin orbit interaction .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to introduce the parameter @xmath23 which characterizes the relative strength of the spin orbit interaction .",
    "eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ lutsp ] ) have definite helicity , the projection of spin on the direction of momentum , @xmath24 ( light holes ) and @xmath25 ( heavy holes ) .",
    "the corresponding masses are @xmath26 in the limit @xmath27 mass of the heavy hole is diverging , @xmath28 , therefore we call this the `` ultrarelativistic '' limit , the limit corresponds to maximum possible spin orbit interaction .    to account for a magnetic field @xmath29 imposed on the system one has ( i ) to account for the vector potential via the long derivative @xmath30 , and ( ii ) to account for the zeeman contribution @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the elementary electric charge . since different components of @xmath33",
    "do not commute there is a well known ambiguity between the gauge and the zeeman terms .",
    "in particular , @xmath34 . therefore the zeeman term added to eq.([lutsp ] ) is different from that added to ( [ lutsp1 ] ) . here",
    "we follow the standard convention  @xcite to use @xmath20 from ( [ lutsp1 ] ) with @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the spin zeeman interaction is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the spin magnetic moment , @xmath37 is bohr magneton , and value of @xmath38 depends on the material  @xcite .",
    "there is also cubic in spin zeeman - like interaction @xmath39 however it is small  @xcite and we disregard it .",
    "we restrict our analysis by linear in magnetic field approximation .",
    "therefore , gauge terms , @xmath30 , also result in a magnetic moment .",
    "as usually , see ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the gauge @xmath40 /2 $ ] to derive the orbital magnetic moment .",
    "all in all the operator of the total magnetic moment is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 here the first term corresponds to ( [ hz ] ) , the second term is the usual orbital magnetic moment which originates from the @xmath10-term in eq.([lutsp1 ] ) , and the last term is a spin dependent magnetic orbital moment which originates from the @xmath11-term in eq.([lutsp1 ] ) .",
    "the 3d - rank tensor in the last term is @xmath43 and @xmath44 is defined in ( [ lutsp1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the total hamiltonian which we consider in this work is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is spherically symmetric potential attracting the hole .",
    "we already pointed out that this section is very similar to papers  @xcite .",
    "we present this section to introduce the method and the notations for further calculations of g - factors . besides that we calculate previously unknown energy levels in a spherical quantum dot .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ hu ] ) is invariant under rotations around the center of symmetry of the potential .",
    "therefore , while because of the spin orbit interaction the orbital angular momentum @xmath47 $ ] is not conserved , the total angular momentum @xmath48 is conserved .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hu ] ) are also the eigenstates of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the hamiltonian contains only the orbital scalar @xmath51 and the orbital quadrupole @xmath52 .",
    "therefore an eigenstate can be a combination of at most two values of orbital angular momentum with @xmath53 , we denote by @xmath54 the minimum of these two values @xmath55 radial wave functions are normalized @xmath56 if @xmath57 , only two values of @xmath54 are possible : @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the special case of @xmath60 realizes only at @xmath61 or @xmath62 . in this case @xmath63 and the wave function is @xmath64 interestingly , while the states with @xmath57 are constructed of both heavy and light holes , the states with @xmath65 are constructed of light holes only .",
    "masses of light and heavy holes behave differently in the important limit @xmath27 , see eq.([mlh ] ) .",
    "we will see that this results in a qualitatively different behavior of @xmath66 and @xmath65 energy levels and g - factors in the limit @xmath27 .    to derive radial equations for functions",
