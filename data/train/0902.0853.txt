    "large scale structures in the universe like galaxies and clusters of galaxies are believed to have formed by gravitational amplification of small perturbations @xcite .",
    "much of the matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies is the so called dark matter that is believed to be weakly interacting and non - relativistic .",
    "dark matter responds mainly to gravitational forces , and by virtue of larger density than baryonic matter , assembly of matter into haloes and large scale structure is driven by gravitational instability of initial perturbations .",
    "galaxies are believed to form when gas in highly over - dense haloes cools and collapses to form stars in significant numbers @xcite .",
    "the formation of first stars in turn leads to emission of uv radiation that starts to ionize the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the period of transition of the igm from a completely neutral to a completely ionized state is known as the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , e.g. , see .",
    "the study of eor has been an active area of research in recent years .",
    "theoretical ideas about the reionization history have been constrained by a variety of observations .",
    "for example , observations of gunn - peterson troughs in agn spectra at @xmath2 @xcite indicate that the process of reionization was nearly complete by that redshift .",
    "bounds on luminosity function of ly@xmath3 galaxies at high redshifts @xcite also constrain the eor .",
    "these bounds are consistent with the conclusion that the igm was completely ionized by @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , thomson scattering by free electrons in the igm of the anisotropic photon distribution that constitutes the cmb leaves a signature in its temperature and polarization anisotropy .",
    "the optical depth due to this scattering @xcite is another probe of eor .",
    "wmap five - year data indicate a value of @xmath4 that corresponds to @xmath5 as the redshift for instantaneous reionization .",
    "realistic scenarios however predict a protracted eor where the process of ionization starts around @xmath6 and ends by @xmath2 .",
    "many possible sources of ionizing radiation have been considered , although stellar sources are believed to be the most plausible candidates @xcite .",
    "the agn density goes down more rapidly for @xmath7 than the density of star - forming galaxies @xcite and therefore agns are not expected to contribute significantly to the ionizing radiation .",
    "x - rays from low mass quasars , x - ray binaries and supernova remnants are constrained by the soft x - ray background observed today @xcite .",
    "particle decays can also play only a minor role in reionization @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we assume that it was radiation from early stars that ionized the igm and ignore other possibilities .",
    "the total photon emissivity of early stars is poorly known .",
    "studies of reionization typically use observations with semi - analytic models of heating and ionization of the igm where efficiency of star formation , evolution of star formation rates , the number of ionizing photons emitted per baryon in stars , etc .",
    "are parameterized in some manner @xcite .",
    "given the complexity of most of these approaches , and the number of parameters , it is often impractical to scan the parameter space .",
    "the main lesson we learn from these studies is that we may not require extraordinary physical processes in order to satisfy available observational constraints of reionization .",
    "we make an attempt to simplify modeling of star formation and other astrophysical aspects of the problem .",
    "this allows us to reduce the number of free parameters in this sector while retaining many significant astrophysical relationships .",
    "statements can then be made about quantities like the escape fraction of uv photons , @xmath8 and their correlations with the cosmological parameters .",
    "large uncertainties exist in parameters related to early star formation , e.g.  the escape fraction of uv photons , @xmath9 , the initial mass function ( imf ) and the efficiency of star formation , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested in the literature that a top - heavy imf with very massive stars is not necessarily favored to satisfy the reionization and metal enrichment constraints @xcite .    in this work",
    "we assume that early star formation happens predominantly during formation and major mergers of haloes , and occurs as a short lived burst .",
    "photon emissivities and metal yields can then be calculated using population synthesis models for different imfs @xcite .",
    "we then test if these scenarios generate enough photons to ionize the universe by @xmath11 by comparing with the observed thomson scattering optical depth .",
    "we also require the models to satisfy constraints arising from the observations of the metal content of the igm .",
    "this constrains the amount of processed elements that escape from the ism to the igm .",
    "we can use models for outflows as a guide and put constraints on the efficiency of star formation , or use `` reasonable '' values of the efficiency of star formation to constrain the metal escape fraction .",
    "we can also combine the two constraints to scale out efficiency of star formation .",
    "the questions we address in this work are :    * to combine constraints of enrichment of the inter - galactic medium with observations of reionization , and check whether the extra information can provide constraints on the initial mass function during early star formation .",
    "* can the combined constraints be used to make useful statements with regard to other potential sources of ionization ? * is there any correlation between the parameters that describe star formation and cosmological parameters ?",
    "relevant observations are described in  [ observation ] .",
    "the reionization model that we use is discussed in  [ reionization ] .",
    "results and discussion appear in  [ results ] and  5 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we solve these equations numerically for different cosmological models . the system of equations ( [ xtoy ] ) and ( [ ytoy ] ) is `` stiff , '' since @xmath12 is a stable point and time scales for evolution of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are very different .",
    "further , @xmath13 is bounded from above ( by unity ) while @xmath14 is not .",
    "thus the usual forward differencing methods do not give accurate solutions easily .",
    "we bypass this problem by noting that during the process of reionization almost every ionizing photon will be immediately absorbed by the medium .",
    "this means that the two terms in the right hand side of the second equation are of the same order till @xmath13 becomes nearly equal to @xmath15 , whereas the left hand side is much smaller and may be assumed to be zero .",
    "this reduces the system of equations to a single equation , which can now be solved using forward differencing methods .",
    "note that this approximation is not valid when @xmath13 approaches 1 , although in practice the approximate solution is fairly accurate up to @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , if we use the approximation up to @xmath17 then we make an error in estimation of @xmath18 of less than @xmath19 .",
    "we take @xmath20 , ignoring its dependence on temperature .",
    "this dependence is fairly weak at temperatures of interest .",
    "we use @xmath21 .",
    "we thus assume that most of the ionizing radiation is around the lyman limit .",
    "the number of ionizing photons released per baryon of stars formed , denoted by @xmath22 , depends on the initial mass function ( imf ) of the stars .",
    "we obtain this number from the starburst99 stellar population synthesis code m@xmath23 .",
    "we use the geneva evolutionary tracks for models with metallicity @xmath24 and the padova tracks with agb stars for models with metallicity @xmath25 . ]",
    "our aim here is to study a variety of models with varying cosmological parameters as well as parameters related to star formation and enrichment . we consider a random subset of flat @xmath0cdm models allowed by wmap5 @xcite .",
    "we do not consider models with massive neutrinos or a non - vanishing tensor component , or models where the primordial power spectrum deviates from a pure power law .",
    "we use only wmap constraints for limiting cosmological parameters .",
    "we used the mcmc chains made available by the wmap team ( http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) .",
    "we considered a random subset of all models allowed with a confidence level of @xmath26 from the mcmc chains .",
    "we studied a handful of models for parameters related to star formation ; details of these are given in table ( [ sfmodels ] ) .",
    "the table lists the imfs used in our study .",
    "we have also listed the amount of ionizing photons produced per baryon in stars , and the total metal yield per baryon for these imfs .",
    "these numbers also depend on the metallicity of gas from which stars form and this is listed in the table as well .",
    "it is interesting to note that for a given imf , as the metallicity increases , the production of ionizing photons per baryon comes down but the amount of enriched material returned to the ism increases .",
    "gas that forms the first stars is likely to have primordial abundance @xcite . in our analysis of all the models , we keep metallicity fixed and",
    "hence it is appropriate to use low values of input metallicity .",
    "metallicity of the igm constrains the product @xmath27 for a given model .",
    "similarly we constrain the product @xmath28 with the optical depth due to reionization for the cmb .",
    "figure ( [ row8fig ] ) shows these products for all cosmological models studies here , when the star formation parameters for model  1 in table  ( [ sfmodels ] ) are used .",
    "given that the efficiency of star formation can at best be @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 , the points in figure ( [ row8fig ] ) also represent lower bounds on @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these are shown as a function of the slope of the primordial power spectrum ( @xmath33 ) , optical depth due to reionization ( @xmath34 ) , and , amplitude of clustering at the scale of @xmath35 h@xmath36mpc ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the best fit wmap5 model is marked in each panel as a star .",
    "we find that there is some correlation between the lower bound on @xmath38 and @xmath34 , and also between @xmath39 and @xmath33 .",
    "there are weak correlations with other cosmological parameters but nothing as remarkable as the two mentioned above .",
    "the efficiency of star formation is likely to be much less than unity in any realistic scenario . indeed ,",
    "if we try to keep the different efficiencies and escape fractions at the same order then we require these to be around @xmath40 , or @xmath41 .",
    "while the escape fraction for ionizing photons and star formation efficiency we have obtained are comparable to those found in other studies , these are higher than the values seen in local galaxies . in particular , it is not clear if it is possible to expel @xmath42 of the metals from the ism to distant parts of the igm using known physical mechanisms . before commenting on the numbers , let us consider the sensitivity of the result to our assumptions .    *",
    "if the imf has a low mass cutoff that is higher than the @xmath43  m@xmath23 used for model  1 from table  ( [ sfmodels ] ) , then a larger fraction of mass goes into high mass stars that produce the ionizing photon flux and the enriched material .",
    "this can lower the required @xmath31 by a significant amount .",
    "the product @xmath39 for model  2 from table  ( [ sfmodels ] ) is shown in figure  ( [ otherfigs ] ) .",
    "there is some evidence that there are more intermediate mass stars in the population of metal poor stars in the halo of the galaxy as compared to metal rich stars , if we normalize the two distributions at low stellar masses @xcite .",
    "thus a higher cutoff for @xmath44 may be required for explaining other observations . *",
    "our analysis assumes that the metallicity of gas that forms stars is fixed . if we do a self - consistent analysis where this is allowed to evolve , the gas metallicity gradually increases .",
    "it is then clear from table  ( [ sfmodels ] ) that later generations of stars will enrich the ism faster . as an illustration",
    ", we can see the results of analysis with higher fixed input metallicity for models  24 in figure  ( [ otherfigs ] ) .",
    "our estimates show that @xmath31 required to satisfy observations can come down by a few tens of percents due to this .",
    "there is a corresponding increase in @xmath45 due to stars with higher metallicity producing fewer ionizing photons .",
    "* we have assumed that haloes with mass above @xmath46 m@xmath23 can form stars .",
    "the standard approach is to assume that radiative feedback during the eor increase this by about an order of magnitude in regions that have been photo - ionized @xcite .",
    "we do not take this into account as it has been pointed out that the actual effect may only be to reduce the efficiency of star formation in lower mass haloes @xcite .",
    "if we do consider the effect of radiative feedback as disabling star formation then it leads to a reduction in total gas available for star formation , and hence requires slightly higher efficiencies and escape fractions .",
    "we find that this effect requires an increase in the two products by about @xmath47 .",
    "* we have assumed that the universe is enriched uniformly .",
    "it may very well happen that the enrichment process is effective only in the vicinity of galaxies .",
    "in such a case only overdense regions are enriched .",
    "the escape fraction of metals required can be lowered by as much as a factor of two if this is the case .",
    "thus we may require only around @xmath19 of the ism to be ejected to the igm on an average in models with @xmath48 this is comparable with semi - analytic _ ab initio _ models of early star formation , outflows and igm enrichment that have been studied in the literature .    we have assumed the same loss fraction for ism for galaxies over the entire range of masses .",
    "this , of course , is not true .",
    "we expect that the low mass galaxies can potentially disperse a large fraction of the ism in supernova explosions but larger galaxies can retain most of their ism @xcite . if most of the igm enrichment is done by metals that form in dwarf galaxies then the constraint is not very stringent . in most models ,",
    "the fraction of mass in galaxies with a halo mass of less than @xmath49  @xmath50 is larger than @xmath42 even at @xmath51 .",
    "if these galaxies lose a significant fraction of the ism on an average and heavier galaxies lose very little mass then we can comfortably satisfy the constraints from enrichment of the igm .",
    "for the first imf listed in table  ( [ sfmodels ] ) .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "we now turn our attention to the ratio of escape fractions for photons and metals .",
    "figure  ( [ ratiofigs ] ) shows the ratio @xmath52 for the first imf listed in table  ( [ sfmodels ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ratio @xmath52 is of order unity , differing from unity by at most a factor of a few .",
    "thus the fraction of ionizing photons that escape galaxies is broadly of the same order as the fraction of metals that must leak into the igm in order to explain the observed enrichment of the igm .",
    "we have not plotted this ratio for other imfs in table  ( [ sfmodels ] ) as the expected change can be seen from figure  2 .",
    "indeed , the change in the ratio is less than a factor two as we consider imfs listed in rows @xmath53 of the table  ( [ sfmodels ] ) .",
    "the last row in the table  ( [ sfmodels ] ) is more appropriate for late time star formation and we need not discuss that here .",
    "most studies of reionization have tended to focus on the escape of ionizing photons . in order to satisfy observations of @xmath18 or the luminosity function of high redshift galaxies ,",
    "these often invoke a top heavy imf for the first generation of stars @xcite .",
    "other sources of ionizing radiation like agns , magnetic fields and decaying dark matter particles have also been studied @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that all such modifications lead to an enhanced production of ionizing photons without affecting the production of metals in a significant manner .",
    "this is because the very massive stars are expected to implode and do not enrich the ism with the products of nuclear fusion that takes place in the core .",
    "the ratio @xmath52 changes on addition of extra sources of ionizing radiation . in view of the arguments presented above , all modifications that have been discussed",
    "so far lead to a smaller @xmath32 . in other words ,",
    "the ratio plotted in figure  ( 3 ) should be thought of as a lower bound .",
    "an important implication of this is that the constraints from enrichment of the igm require certain amount of star formation , and this requirement needs to be satisfied even when we invoke other sources of ionizing radiation during the epoch of reionization .",
    "that is , adding new potential sources of ionizing radiation can be helpful only in lowering the escape fraction of ionizing photons and not in lowering the amount of star formation can be reduced by a significant amount . ] .",
    "we may even end up with a scenario where a much larger fraction of processed elements need to be transferred from the ism to the igm as compared to the fraction of uv photons escaping from galaxies .",
    "we have compared simple models for star formation in the early universe with two observational constraints .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows us to consider variation in cosmological parameters as well .",
    "we present a summary of our results here :    * the product of star formation efficiency and escape fraction of ionizing photons , @xmath38 , is correlated with the optical depth due to reionization . *",
    "the product of star formation efficiency and escape fraction of ism , @xmath54 , is anti - correlated with the index of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "* these are weak correlations , in the sense that the values for the two products do not change strongly for small changes in the cosmological parameter in question .",
    "* we do not find any other correlation amongst parameters of star formation and cosmological parameters .",
    "* we are able to satisfy observational constraints with the standard initial mass function for stars observed in the local universe @xcite , and with reasonable values for star formation efficiency and escape fractions for photons and ism . given that the local imf itself is somewhat ill constrained , this implies that we do not require a significant evolution of the imf in order to explain observations considered here .",
    "* small variations in the imf , indicated by observations of metal poor stars in the galaxy , reduce the efficiency of star formation and the escape fractions required for the standard imf .",
    "* approximations used by us in the model do not change the overall numbers by more than @xmath55 . indeed , different approximations change numbers in different directions so we can consider the overall results to be fairly robust . *",
    "our model allows us to estimate the ratio of the two escape fractions .",
    "we find that the two escape fractions are of the same order . *",
    "if we consider other potential sources of ionizing photons then the required escape fraction for photons can come down , however the escape fraction for processed elements does not change . indirectly , the required amount of star formation is required to remain the same unless there is some very efficient mechanism for transporting processed elements into the igm while keeping the escape fraction of ionizing photons low .",
    "the most important conclusion of this work is that star formation without a significant evolution of the imf is sufficient for satisfying the two constraints considered here .",
    "the escape fractions , and/or the star formation efficiency is required to be higher than we see in local galaxies .",
    "one can consider other sources of ionizing radiation , indeed at least some of these must be present .",
    "but as we have pointed out , these help in reducing only the escape fraction for ionizing radiation as none of the other potential sources help in transporting enriched material from the inter - stellar medium to the inter - galactic medium .",
    "this highlights the significance of the constraint arising from enrichment of the igm for epoch of reionization studies .",
