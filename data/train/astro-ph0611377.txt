    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is the most primary product of the star formation process . with this one relation , it is possible to directly probe the crucial predictions of star formation models .",
    "surprisingly , the imf is approximately universal , following the salpeter law ( salpeter 1995 ) for masses between 1 and @xmath10 ( kroupa 2002 ) . on the low mass end",
    ", there appears to be a universal rollover around @xmath11 , and the high mass end seems to be truncated by a sharp cutoff near @xmath12 ( weidner & kroupa 2004 ; figer 2005 ) .",
    "however , star formation theories predict that the lower mass cutoff ( @xmath13 ) should be a function of environmental parameters , i.e. magnetic field strength and cloud temperature ( e.g. , bonnell , larson , & zinnecker 2006 ) . in the extreme environment of the galactic center ( gc ) ,",
    "some of these models predict an elevated lower mass cutoff / rollover with respect to that observed in the disk ( morris 1993 ) .",
    "if this prediction is true , then the gc should have an abnormally bright lower mass cutoff , something that has not been _ directly _ observed anywhere in the universe .",
    "the best places to trace the imf near the gc are the two young star clusters therein : the arches and quintuplet clusters ( see figer et al .",
    "1999 for findings and early studies on these clusters ) .",
    "these clusters are very young ( 24  myr ) , compact ( @xmath14  pc ) , and only 2030  parsecs away from the gc in projection , while they appear to be as massive as the smallest galactic globular clusters ( @xmath15 ; kim et al .",
    "2000 ) . of the two clusters ,",
    "the arches is preferred for studies of the low - end mass function ( mf ) as the quintuplet is significantly more dispersed .",
    "while the arches cluster s compactness makes its stars easily identifiable for their high spatial density projected onto the background population , this same property makes confusion a problem at faint magnitudes . note for scale that a @xmath16 dwarf has @xmath17 in the cluster .",
    "for instance , the luminosity function ( lf ) obtained from _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) nicmos observations by figer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the whole cluster was 50  % complete at @xmath5 . the adaptive optics ( ao ) science demonstration data observed with the gemini / hokupaa system were analyzed by yang et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and stolte et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who obtained a 50  % completeness level at @xmath18 and a 75  % completeness level at @xmath5 for the whole cluster , respectively .",
    "stolte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have analyzed the natural guide star ( ngs ) ao observations of the cluster with the very large telescope naos / conica system , and derived the mf of the intermediate region of the cluster ( @xmath3@xmath19 ) down to @xmath20 at a 50  % completeness limit .",
    "although the last study reached the faintest magnitude to date , due to the lack of suitable ngs candidates for neighboring fields , it lacks the observations of nearby background populations , which should be subtracted from the lf / mf of the cluster field to obtain the true cluster lf / mf .",
    "it had no choice but to compare the mf from the central and intermediate regions of the cluster ( @xmath21 ) with that from the outer region ( @xmath22 ) to infer the mf of the cluster only . however , while there are almost no bright cluster stars in this outer region , a non - negligible number of faint cluster stars may be present there due to mass segregation . for example , the comparison between _ hst _ observations and @xmath23-body simulations by kim et al .",
    "( 2000 ) indicates that the tidal radius of the arches cluster is @xmath24@xmath25 .",
    "thus a reliable estimation of the lf / mf of the nearby background populations would require observations of control fields that are at least @xmath25 away from the cluster center .",
    "for this reason , we have carried out keck / nirc2 laser guide star ( lgs ) ao observations of the arches cluster and its nearby background populations to take advantage of the lgs ao system that does not have the distance limit from ngs candidates . here",
    ", we present the analysis of these observations along with results from several relevant @xmath23-body simulations .",
    "the images were obtained using the keck / nirc2 lgs ao system on 2006 may 4 & 5 .",
    "the arches cluster ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; j2000 ) was observed with the medium ( @xmath28 , 0.0198 pixel@xmath29 ) and wide ( @xmath30 , 0.0397 pixel@xmath29 ) field cameras , and three nearby control fields , separated @xmath31 from the cluster center , were imaged with the medium field camera in order to sample the background population .",
    "the locations of these fields in galactic coordinates are shown in figure  [ fig : location ] .",
    "all fields were imaged in @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands in a 9-point dither pattern with a leg size of @xmath32 .",
    "the multiple correlated double sampling ( mcds ) mode was used with 10 coadds and a 10  s integration time per coadd , giving a total exposure time of 900  s per field .",
    "obtained strehl ratios for the @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) images are 0.17 ( 0.08 ) , 0.19 ( 0.08 ) , 0.25 ( 0.06 ) , 0.13 ( 0.06 ) , and 0.12 ( 0.06 ) for the medium cluster field , control fields a , b , c , and wide cluster field , respectively , resulting in fwhms of 70100  mas for @xmath1 , and 6198  mas for @xmath0 .    for data reduction ,",
    "the dithered images were first combined by maximizing the cross - correlation .",
    "star finding , point - spread function ( psf ) building , and psf fitting procedures were performed using the daophot package within the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "the medium field camera psfs were moderately elongated toward the center of the image due to a relatively small isoplanatic patch obtained during the observations , thus we have allowed the psfs to be quadratically variable along both axes of the field .",
    "typical daophot magnitude errors were less than 0.05  mag down to @xmath33 for stars in the cluster field with @xmath34 ( @xmath35 for the wide field camera ) and @xmath36 for stars in the nearby fields .",
    "we do not include stars with errors greater than 0.2  mag ( @xmath37 ) in our analyses .",
    "the elongation of the psf of the medium camera was significant at the four corners of the images , so we excluded stars farther than @xmath19 from the image center .",
    "photometric calibration was done against the _",
    "photometry by figer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) assuming that @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes are identical to nicmos f160w and f205w magnitudes for the stars in our fields ( kim et al . 2005 and",
    "stolte et al .",
    "2002 indicate that the transformation from @xmath0 and @xmath38 to @xmath39 and @xmath40 filters has a very weak dependence on color for the stars in the arches cluster ) .",
    "completeness tests were performed for all images by adding artificial stars to the observed images with the psf obtained from our reduction .",
    "800 artificial stars were used per magnitude bin ( a total of 7200 stars ) , but only 200 stars were added per test image . for our analyses in the following sections , we will only consider magnitude and mass bins with a completeness fraction larger than 50  % .",
    "due to the relatively irregular shape of the ao psfs , the daophot star - finding algorithm resulted in many bogus stars around bright stars , and we have excluded from our photometry the faint stars that are @xmath41  mag fainter than a nearby ( within @xmath42 for the medium field camera and @xmath43 for the wide field camera ) , brighter star . since the central region of the cluster is dominated by bright stars , we will analyze the lf / mf of the intermediate region ( @xmath3@xmath44 ) where the photometry of the faint stars is limited by the background confusion .",
    "but there are still a few bright stars in the intermediate region that can hamper the recovery of nearby fainter stars .",
    "since we are more interested in the incompleteness of faint stars by background confusion than that by nearby bright stars , we exclude artificial stars that are @xmath41  mag fainter and within @xmath42 ( @xmath43 for the wide field ) from a nearby star from calculating the completeness fractions .",
    "for our analyses , we adopt the extinction law by rieke , rieke , & paul ( 1989 ; @xmath45 ) and the distance modulus for the gc of 14.52  mag ( 8  kpc ) .",
    "stolte et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported color variation of stars as a function of the distance from the cluster center and interpreted it as a local depletion of dust ( and thus a smaller extinction ) at the cluster center due to winds from massive stars or photo - evaporation of dust grains by the intense uv radiation field .",
    "our data confirm such variation , and we determine the extinction values for the @xmath3@xmath44 annulus of the cluster field , the outer ( @xmath46 ) region of the cluster field , and three control fields separately .",
    "then we assume that stars in the same field or annulus have the same extinction value .",
    "we compare the 2  myr , solar - metallicity isochrone from the geneva set of models ( lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) to our color - magnitude ( @xmath47 vs. @xmath1 ) diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cm ] ) and obtain an average extinction at @xmath1 of @xmath48  mag for the @xmath3@xmath44 annulus of the cluster field , which is consistent with the extinctin value estimated by stolte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for the same region .",
    "our control fields and outer region of the cluster field are expected to be composed of stars with a variety of ages and metallicities ( figer et al .",
    "however , @xmath47 colors of the stars with intrinsic @xmath1 magnitudes of 13  mag , which have undereddened , apparent @xmath1 magnitudes of 1820  mag at the gc , vary only little ( @xmath49  mag ; see kim et al .",
    "2005 , for example ) for various ages and metallicities .",
    "so we compare the 1  gyr , solar - metallicity isochrone to the @xmath47 color distribution of stars with underredened , apparent @xmath1 of 1820  mag , and find that our control fields a , b , & c have @xmath50 of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , & @xmath53  mag , respectively , and the outer region of the cluster field has @xmath54  mag ( quoted uncertainties are the averages of the extinction spread ) . since the amounts of extinction spread are similar in our cluster and control fields , the differential extinction in each field will not cause a problem to our subtraction of background population from the cluster field .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfkc ] compares the dereddened , completeness - corrected @xmath1band lfs for the control fields and that for the outer region ( @xmath55 ) of the cluster field obtained with the wide field camera . while the lfs of control fields a and c are quite similar , control field b and the outer region of the cluster field",
    "generally have higher lfs than the former .",
    "this is probably because the control field b is located closer to the galactic plane where the stellar density is larger and a part of the outskirt and tidal tail of the arches cluster might be included in our outer cluster field .",
    "we take an average of control fields a , b , and c as the lf of the background population of the cluster .",
    "note that this will probably overestimate the background population toward the arches cluster slightly since we do not have a control field that is located at the opposite side of the control field b , and thus our estimate for the cluster lf / mf would be a lower limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : lf ] compares the dereddened @xmath1band lfs for the background population ( an average of control fields a , b , and c ) and that for the intermediate region of the cluster field obtained with the medium field camera .",
    "the figure shows both raw and completeness - corrected lfs , and the latter of the cluster field is clearly larger than that of the background population at least down to @xmath56  mag , which is the 50  % completeness limit for the cluster field .",
    "the @xmath0band lfs give a similar result except that their 50  % completeness limit is 0.51 mag brighter than for the @xmath1 band ( the limit in @xmath0 itself is 1  mag brighter than that in @xmath1 , but the typical apparent @xmath47 colors of faint stars in the cluster field are 1.52 mag ) .",
    "we convert the apparent magnitudes into masses using the geneva models . here",
    ", we only use @xmath1band data as they provide deeper photometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : mf ] shows our completeness - corrected mf for the cluster intermediate region after background subtraction , along with the mf from stolte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that is also completeness - corrected , but _ not _ background - subtracted ; both are scaled to an area of @xmath3@xmath44 annulus .",
    "the mf of stolte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows a global turnover below @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , which is also their 50  % completeness limit , but our cluster mf , whose 50  % completeness limit is at @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , still has a significant amount of stars below @xmath61 and keeps increasing at least down to @xmath62 . note that our mf increases even below our 50  % completeness limit .",
    "stolte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) claim that there may be a turnover near @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) in their mf and that this might indicate a global decrease of the background - subtracted mf below that mass .",
    "however , our data , which have a quarter dex lower completeness limit in mass , indicate that the mf globally increases down to our completeness limit even after background subtraction . therefore , we presume that the turnover around @xmath65 claimed by stolte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is in fact a local bump in the mf as see in figure  [ fig : mf ] .",
    "eisenhauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find a similar bump in their lf of the galactic starburst template ngc 3603 , and show that such a bump is an indication of the young age ( @xmath66  myr ) using the evolutionary pre - main - sequence tracks by palla & stahler ( 1993 ) .",
    "when fit to a single power - law relation , our cluster mf gives a power - law exponent of @xmath67 ( the sapleter slope is @xmath68 ) for the mass range of @xmath691.7 .",
    "this is slightly steeper than the exponent for massive stars only ( @xmath701.7 ) , @xmath71 .",
    "we have performed several fokker - planck calculations ( for @xmath72 & @xmath16 ) and @xmath23-body simulations ( for @xmath73 ) targeted for the arches cluster with initial cluster conditions similar to those used in kim , morris , & lee ( 1999 ) and kim et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , one of which is no initial mass segretation .",
    "we find that the @xmath8 values for the projected annulus of @xmath3@xmath44 increase by 0.10.2 during the lifetime of the arches cluster , 22.5  myr .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that the imf of the cluster has @xmath74 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mf ] shows two mfs for our annulus from our fokker - planck calculations that best match the observed mf at 2  myr .",
    "these two calculations have considerably different @xmath13 s ( 0.1 & @xmath16 ) , but result in nearly identical mfs for the annulus .",
    "thus our estimate for the imf from the simulations does not sensitively depend on the choice of @xmath13 .    using the red clump stars in the region @xmath75 and @xmath76 that were observed with the infrared survey facility telescope , nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2006 ) newly estimated the near - infrared extinction law toward the inner galactic bulge . when assuming this extinction law , which is derived by averaging for rather larger region of the gc , is applicable to the stars in our images , we find that the 50  % completness limit moves down to @xmath16 , but there is almost no change in @xmath8 for our annulus ( @xmath77 )",
