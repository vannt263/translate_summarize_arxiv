    "the nucleons ( proton and neutron ) , the basic building blocks of nuclear matter , account for more than @xmath4 of the mass of the visible matter in the universe . understanding the nucleon structure is one of the most important issues in modern physics and has challenged us for decades .",
    "the internal structure of the nucleon presents a wealth of fundamental questions , that have a deep impact on our understanding of nature and the universe we live in .",
    "the strong interaction , that is mostly responsible for the structure of the nucleon , poses a special challenge to us due to the strong and non - linear nature of the force .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the accepted theory for the strong interaction .",
    "quarks and gluons are the fundamental particles and force mediators , while nucleons and mesons ( pions , kaons , etc . ) , collectively called hadrons , are composite particles and effective force mediators .",
    "qcd has been well tested at high energy ( asymptotic - free ) when the interaction is relatively weak due to the running of strong coupling constant .",
    "however , at low energy ( scale of the size of a hadron ) , the strong force becomes truly strong , leading to chiral symmetry breaking and the confinement of the quarks and gluons inside the hadron where none can escape to become free particles . in the strong region of qcd , the usual calculation technique of",
    "perturbative expansion fails , and qcd can not be easily solved .",
    "effective field theories , such as chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , are often used .",
    "recently , great progress has been made in the advancement of lattice qcd  @xcite , which has begun to provide some calculations of qcd in the strong region .",
    "another approach  @xcite is to stay with the continuous field theory by using the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "newly developed anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft )  @xcite might provide another useful tool to study strong qcd .",
    "in addition to the truly strong region , understanding the transition from weak ( perturbative ) to strong ( non - perturbative ) region is also very important .",
    "one approach is to start from high energy where the quarks and gluons ( collectively called partons ) are asymptotically free . with the help of the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite",
    ", one can systematically expand to a twist series , where the leading twist term gives the parton distributions and the higher - twist terms characterize the quark - gluon and quark - quark correlations .",
    "lattice qcd can also provide useful calculations .",
    "constituent - quark models are also often used to provide intuitive pictures in this region .",
    "experimentally , deep - inelastic lepton scattering ( dis ) together with other processes , such as drell - yan , direct photon and heavy quark productions , have been powerful tools to study nucleon structure .",
    "the unpolarized structure functions extracted from the last five decades , covering five - order of magnitudes in both @xmath5 and @xmath6ranges , are the most extensive set of precision data in nucleon structure study .",
    "the longitudinally polarized structure functions extracted from the last three decades have reached reasonable precision , covering two to three - order of magnitudes in @xmath5 and @xmath6 ranges .",
    "transversely polarized measurements have been the recent focus , but are still scarce .",
    "the lower moments of the structure functions provide the most direct tests and comparisons with theoretical calculations through sum rules .    in the study of nucleon structure",
    ", spin has played an essential role and often brought big surprises .",
    "spin was first introduced as an internal property of a particle , related to the magnetic moment , to explain the famous stern - gerlach results  @xcite that the silver atoms split into two beams after passing through an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "the discovery of the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton  @xcite was the first big spin surprise .",
    "this discovery was the beginning of the ( indirect ) study of nucleon structure , since the anomalous magnetic moment was one piece of evidence for the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "later on , it was related to the integration of the excitation spectrum of nucleon spin structure by the sum rule of gerasimov , drell and hearn ( gdh )  @xcite .",
    "the direct study of nucleon structure started decades later when hofstadter  @xcite used elastic electron scattering to directly measure the form factors of the proton .    in the last thirty years",
    ", the spin structure of the nucleon has led to very productive experimental and theoretical activity with exciting results and new challenges@xcite .",
    "this investigation has included a variety of aspects such as testing qcd in its perturbative region _ via _ spin sum rules ( like the bjorken sum rule@xcite ) and understanding how the spin of the nucleon is built from the intrinsic degrees of freedom of the theory : quarks and gluons .",
    "recently , results from a new generation of experiments performed at jefferson lab seeking to probe the theory in its non - perturbative and transition regions have reached a mature state .",
    "the low momentum - transfer results offer insight in a region characterized by the collective behavior of the nucleon constituents and their interactions . in this region",
    ", it has been more economical to describe the nucleon using effective degrees of freedom like mesons and constituent quarks rather than current quarks and gluons .",
    "furthermore , distinct features seen in the nucleon response to the electromagnetic probe , depending on the resolution of the probe , point clearly to different regions of description , _",
    "i.e. _ a scaling region where quark - gluon correlations are suppressed versus a coherent region where long - range interactions give rise to the static properties of the nucleon .    in this review",
    "we describe an investigation  @xcite@xmath7@xcite of the spin structure of the nucleon through measurements of the helicity - dependent photoabsorption cross sections or asymmetries by using virtual photons covering a wide resolution spectrum .",
    "these observables are used to extract the spin structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath8 and evaluate their moments .",
    "these moments are key ingredients to test qcd sum rules and unravel some aspects of the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon .",
    "leptons do not involve the strong interaction directly . with the electromagnetic interaction",
    "well - understood , lepton beams have been a very powerful precision probe to study nucleon structure .",

    "<S> nucleon structure study is one of the most important research areas in modern physics and has challenged us for decades . </S>",
    "<S> spin has played an essential role and often brought surprises and puzzles to the investigation of the nucleon structure and the strong interaction . </S>",
    "<S> new experimental data on nucleon spin structure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high momentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture in the strong region of the interaction and of the transition region from the strong to the asymptotic - free region . </S>",
    "<S> insight for some aspects of the theory for the strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , is gained by exploring lower moments of spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules ( i.e. the bjorken , burkhardt - cottingham , gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) , and the generalized gdh ) . </S>",
    "<S> these moments are expressed in terms of an operator - product expansion using quark and gluon degrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers . </S>",
    "<S> the higher - twist contributions have been examined through the evolution of these moments as the momentum transfer varies from higher to lower values . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , qcd - inspired low - energy effective theories , which explicitly include chiral symmetry breaking , are tested at low momentum transfers . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of these theories is further examined as the momentum transfer increases to moderate values . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that chiral perturbation theory calculations agree reasonably well with the first moment of the spin structure function @xmath0 at low momentum transfer of 0.05 - 0.1 gev@xmath1 but fail to reproduce some of the higher moments , noticeably , the neutron data in the case of the generalized polarizability @xmath2 . the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule has been verified with good accuracy in a wide range of @xmath3 assuming that no singular behavior of the structure functions is present at very high excitation energies . </S>"
