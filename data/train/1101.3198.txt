    "the potential to further extend the efficient use of resources when interchanging data between two nodes in a bi - directional way over a relay @xcite has led to a lot of recent works . although , some years ago , it has been shown that with a careful design of transmission protocols @xcite , relaying can also be used to increase the communication rate in the presence of a direct path , two - way relaying is still mostly considered in the context of a connectivity problem , e.g. , @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "there two nodes can not establish a direct communication and convey messages over a third node , the relay . here a more general approach to half - duplex two - way relaying is taken .",
    "two nodes that have a direct connection want to perform a dialog .",
    "it is to decide if a third node should join the communication process in order to facilitate the exchange of messages .",
    "the motivation to do so could be to maximize the communication rates for given resources or to minimize resources for given rates .",
    "the ultimate solution to both problems is to use the channel in the most efficient way by organizing the communication process in the network .",

    "* section 9.1 ) .",
    "each node faces a half - duplex constraint , i.e. , it can not receive and transmit simultaneously . for simplicity",
    "all links support one reliable bit per channel use .",
    "nodes 1 and 3 want to exchange messages ( bits ) while node 2 can assist the communication process as a relay .",
    "the simplest way to communicate is to let the dialog nodes send sequentially to each other while node 2 stays turned off ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2wrctwc ] ) .",
    "this communication strategy , referred to as two - way channel ( twc ) , allows to transmit two bits within two steps .",
    "the communication rate is @xmath0 bits per step ( bps ) . asking for the cost @xmath1 of the communication protocol",
    "we conclude that two links have been used , @xmath2 links per bit ( lpb ) or two nodes have been activated , @xmath2 nodes per bit ( npb ) .",

    "the rate attains @xmath5 bps while the cost is @xmath4 lpb or @xmath4 npb .",

    "note that interestingly with this scheme the rate is higher than in the simple two - way communication without relay at a lower node - based cost .    finally , consider a four - step scheme like depicted in fig .",

    "the simple example given indicates that two - way relaying schemes on half - duplex communication systems might offer possibilities to enhance the performance of bi - directional communication even in the presence of a direct connection",
    ". obviously , such wireline examples neglect the properties of wireless channels , i.e. , links supporting asymmetric rates , statistical dependence of links resulting in broadcasting and superposition .",
    "but note that there are wireless channels that might allow to enforce situations similar to wireline through _ pre - coding techniques _ , e.g. , mimo wireless channels @xcite .",
    "the example also suggests that treating the fully - connected problem like a _ separated two - way relay channel _ @xcite and ignoring the direct path might be not optimal .",
