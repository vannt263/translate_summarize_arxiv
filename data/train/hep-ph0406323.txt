    "lhc experiments will have the capability to observe a higgs boson , standard model ( sm ) or non , in a variety of channels , in particular if its mass lies in the intermediate mass region , @xmath14  gev , as suggested by direct searches  @xcite and electroweak precision data  @xcite .",
    "once the higgs boson is discovered and its mass measured , one will want to gain as much information as possible on its couplings to both gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "these measurements will provide crucial tests of the mass generation mechanism realized in nature .",
    "the various higgs couplings determine higgs production cross sections and decay branching fractions . by measuring the rates of multiple channels ,",
    "various combinations of couplings can be determined .",
    "a principal problem at the lhc is that there is no technique analogous to the measurement of the missing mass spectrum at a linear collider  @xcite which would directly determine the total higgs production cross section .",
    "the decay @xmath15 , which by far dominates for a light higgs boson , will be detectable but suffer from large experimental uncertainties .",
    "in addition , some higgs decay modes can not be observed at the lhc .",
    "for example , @xmath16 or decays into light quarks will remain hidden below overwhelming qcd dijet backgrounds .",
    "this implies that absolute measurements of ( partial ) decay widths are possible only with additional theoretical assumptions .",
    "one possible strategy was outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite . assuming the absence of unexpected decay channels and a sm ratio of the @xmath15 and @xmath17 partial widths , absolute measurements of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and of the top quark yukawa coupling squared , @xmath22 , are possible , with errors in the @xmath23 range .    here",
    "we revisit the information that could be extracted at the lhc from rate measurements of an intermediate - mass higgs boson .",
    "we consider the expected accuracies at various stages of the lhc program : after 30  fb@xmath24 of low luminosity ( @xmath25 ) running , 300  fb@xmath24 at high luminosity ( @xmath26 ) , and a mixed scenario where the weak boson fusion channels are assumed to suffer substantially from pile - up problems under high luminosity running conditions ( making forward jet tagging and central jet veto fairly inefficient ) .    a rather model - independent analysis , where only ratios of couplings ( or partial widths ) could be extracted , was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we consider general multi - higgs - doublet models ( with or without additional higgs singlets ) , in which the @xmath27 and @xmath28 couplings are bounded from above by their sm values , i.e. , we impose theoretically motivated constraints on these two couplings .",
    "these constraints are valid , in particular , for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and will sharpen the implications of lhc data for higgs couplings very significantly .    as an illustration of coupling measurements at the lhc",
    ", we consider specific mssm benchmark scenarios of ref .",
    "@xcite as examples .",
    "the significance of deviations of the measured rates from sm predictions provides a measure of the sensitivity of lhc measurements in the higgs sector .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : channels ] we review the existing analyses on the production and decay channels used throughout our paper , followed by our theoretical assumptions and fitting procedure details in sections  [ sec : nomodel ] and  [ sec : mssm_specific ] , respectively for general multi - higgs - doublet models and a specific mssm scenario . section  [ sec : sum_out ] contains a summary and outlook .",
    "in order to determine the properties of a physical state such as a higgs boson , one needs at least as many separate measurements as properties to be measured , although two or more measurements can be made from the same channel if different information is used , e.g. , total rate and an angular distribution .",
    "fortunately , the lhc will provide us with many different higgs observation channels . in the sm",
    "there are four relevant production modes : gluon fusion ( gf ; loop - mediated , dominated by the top quark ) , which dominates inclusive production ; weak boson fusion ( wbf ) , which has an additional pair of hard and far - forward / backward jets in the final state ; top - quark associated production ( @xmath29 ) ; and weak boson associated production ( @xmath30 ) , where the weak boson is identified by its leptonic decay .",
    "although a higgs is expected to couple to all sm particles , not all these decays would be observable .",
    "very rare decays ( e.g. , to electrons ) would have no observable rate , and other modes are unidentifiable qcd final states in a hadron collider environment ( gluons or quarks lighter than bottom ) .",
    "in general , however , the lhc will be able to observe higgs decays to photons , weak bosons , tau leptons and @xmath31 quarks , in the range of higgs masses where the branching ratio ( br ) in question is not too small .    for a higgs in the intermediate mass range , the total width , @xmath32 ,",
    "is expected to be small enough to use the narrow - width approximation in extracting couplings .",
    "the rate of any channel ( with the @xmath33 decaying to final state particles @xmath34 ) is , to good approximation , given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the higgs partial width involving the production couplings and where the higgs branching ratio for the decay is written as @xmath37 .",
    "even with cuts , the observed rate directly determines the product @xmath38 ( normalized to the calculable sm value of this product ) .",
    "the lhc will have access to ( or provide upper limits on ) combinations of @xmath39 and the square of the top yukawa coupling , @xmath40 .",
    ", because , for a light higgs , the decay @xmath41 is kinematically forbidden . ]    since experimental analyses are driven by the final state observed , we classify higgs channels by decay rather than production mode , and then discuss the different production characteristics as variants of the final state . however , some initial comments on production modes are in order",
    ". first , experimental studies mostly do not yet include the very large ( n)nlo enhancements known for @xmath42  @xcite . even if background corrections are as large as for the signal , which they typically are not , the statistical significance of the gf channels will be greater than estimated by the current studies ( which we have used for this paper ) .",
    "furthermore , the nnlo calculations may reduce also the theory systematic uncertainty for the signal .",
    "second , experimental studies do not consider wbf channels above 30  fb@xmath24 integrated luminosity , because the efficiency to tag forward jets at high - luminosity lhc running is not yet fully understood .",
    "this is a very conservative assumption .",
    "we also discuss a scenario where a higher luminosity is available in the wbf channels .",
    "the literature on higgs channels at lhc is extensive .",
    "we refer here only those analyses which we use in our fits .",
    "mostly , these are recent experimental analyses which contain references to the earlier phenomenological proposals .",
    "we always use the rates as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite for our fits .",
    "the individual channels used for the fits are :    * gf @xmath43 @xcite * wbf @xmath44 @xcite * gf @xmath45 @xcite * wbf @xmath46 @xcite * @xmath47 ( 2@xmath48 and 3@xmath48 final state ) @xcite * @xmath49 ( 2@xmath48 and 3@xmath48 final state ) @xcite * inclusive higgs boson production : @xmath50 @xcite * wbf @xmath51 @xcite * @xmath52 @xcite * @xmath53 @xcite * @xmath54 @xcite * wbf @xmath55 @xcite * @xmath56 @xcite    for the wbf channels we include a minijet veto , even if the study cited did not . in the discussion below , statements about higgs rates typically refer to the sm - like case .",
    "substantially suppressed branching ratios are possible beyond the sm and may change a measurement into an upper bound .",
    "leptons are the objects most easily identified in the final state , so this decay is regarded as `` golden '' due to its extreme cleanliness and very low background .",
    "it is a rare decay due to the subdominance of @xmath58 relative to @xmath59 , and because of the very small br of @xmath60 .",
    "fortunately , due to the possible decay to off - shell @xmath61  bosons , a sm higgs has non - negligible br to @xmath62 even for @xmath63 , down to approximately 120  gev .",
    "due to the low event rate , current studies concentrate on inclusive measurements which are dominated by gf .",
    "they provide information mainly on the product @xmath64 .",
    "the most advanced analysis for this channel  @xcite was made recently by atlas .",
    "( for an older cms study , see  @xcite ) .",
    "its principal improvement over previous studies is the use of all available nlo results ( the only study so far to do this ) for both the dominant gf signal and its major backgrounds .",
    "further improvements can be expected in the inclusion of off - shell contributions to the @xmath65 background , for which atlas used an approximate k - factor .    by isolating the wbf contribution",
    "one obtains some independent information on the product @xmath66 , in particular if high - luminosity running can be exploited for this channel .",
    "photons are also readily identifiable , but are more difficult than leptons to measure because of a large , non - trivial background from jets faking photons .",
    "higgs photonic decay is loop - induced and therefore rare , even more so because of destructive interference between the top - quark and @xmath67 loops .",
    "this is in some sense advantageous , because this decay mode is thus sensitive to variations in the weak gauge and top yukawa couplings and additional particles in the loop .",
    "this decay is visible in the sm only for the lower higgs mass range , @xmath68  gev .    despite the difficulties of identifying photons , which are not yet fully understood for the lhc , especially for high - luminosity running",
    ", higgs decays to photons should be observable in both gf  @xcite and wbf  @xcite , unless @xmath69 is substantially smaller than in the sm .",
    "these channels measure the products @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath50 signals in @xmath72 and @xmath73 production  @xcite are very weak , due to the paucity of events even at high - luminosity running , but could be used as supplemental channels , and would be especially useful if lhc observes a non - sm higgs .",
    "this decay can be observed in gf  @xcite and wbf  @xcite using @xmath75 final states , as well as in @xmath29 associated production using combinations of multilepton final states  @xcite .",
    "the first two modes extract the products @xmath76 and @xmath77 and are extremely powerful statistically , while the @xmath29 mode can extract the top yukawa coupling with high luminosity once @xmath78 is known .",
    "all these channels are accessible over a wide range of higgs masses , approximately @xmath79  gev .",
    "an additional study  @xcite of the @xmath80 channel for @xmath81  gev found only a very weak signal , less than @xmath82 even for 300  fb@xmath24 of data .",
    "we include this channel in our analysis .",
    "the gf mode should improve after ( n)nlo effects are included , although the backgrounds considered did not include off - shell @xmath83 .",
    "also , the single - top background was conservatively overestimated .",
    "a reanalysis of this channel with updated simulation tools would be in order .",
    "observing higgs decays to taus is not possible in gf because of serious background problems and because the invariant mass of a tau pair can be reconstructed only when the taus do not decay back - to - back , which leaves only a small fraction of gf events with sizable higgs transverse momentum .",
    "observation of @xmath84 is possible in wbf , however  @xcite , for higgs masses below about 150  gev . as the average higgs @xmath85 in this production mode is @xmath86  gev ,",
    "the taus are only rarely produced back - to - back .",
    "this is a relatively rare decay mode , since br(@xmath17 ) is typically @xmath87 in this mass region and the taus decay further .",
    "at least one tau must decay leptonically , giving another small br .",
    "fortunately , the qcd background to taus is small , due to excellent fake jet rejection . while not a discovery channel , this channel is statistically quite powerful even with only moderate luminosity , and thus becomes one of the more important decay modes in a couplings analysis .",
    "this channel measures the product @xmath88 .",
    "associated higgs-@xmath31 quark production has too small a cross section in a sm - like higgs sector to be observable , so the decay @xmath15 is the only experimental access to the @xmath31 yukawa coupling .",
    "because this mode dominates higgs decays at low mass ( @xmath89  gev within the sm ) , an accurate measurement of the bottom yukawa coupling is extremely important .",
    "unfortunately , due to the typically large qcd backgrounds for @xmath31 jets , it is very difficult to observe this decay .",
    "the production modes @xmath29  @xcite and @xmath90  @xcite might allow very rough measurements for such a light higgs , but the statistical significances are quite low and the background uncertainties quite large and their rates probably underestimated ; they are definitely high - luminosity measurements .",
    "the @xmath29 channel measures the product @xmath91 , and so would require a separate , precise measurement of @xmath40 to isolate @xmath92 .",
    "for @xmath90 production , the rate is proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "but here the @xmath94 continuum background has hitherto been underestimated since the nlo qcd corrections are very large and positive  @xcite .",
    "a veto on additional jets may help but requires another detector - level simulation ; unfortunately , it would also increase the background uncertainty because additional jet activity has been calculated at lo only .",
    "we include the @xmath29 channel but not @xmath90 in our analysis .",
    "the production and decay channels discussed above refer to a single higgs resonance , with decay signatures which also exist in the sm",
    ". the higgs sector may be much richer , of course .",
    "the mssm with its two higgs doublets predicts the existence of three neutral and one charged pair of higgs bosons , and the lhc may be able to directly observe several of these resonances . within susy models ,",
    "additional decays , e.g. , into very light super - partners , may be kinematically allowed .",
    "the additional observation of super - partners or of heavier higgs bosons will strongly focus the theoretical framework and restrict the parameter space of a higgs couplings analysis  @xcite .    at the present time ,",
    "even enumerating the possibilities is an open - ended task . for our present analysis",
    "we therefore ignore the information which would be supplied by the observation of additional new particles .",
    "instead we ask the better - defined question of how well lhc measurements of the above decay modes of a single higgs resonance can determine the various higgs boson couplings or partial widths .",
    "in spite of the many decay channels discussed above , the lhc is faced with the challenge that not all higgs decay modes can be detected ( e.g. , @xmath16 is deemed unobservable ) or that some important decay rates , in particular @xmath15 , will suffer from large experimental uncertainties . in a model - independent analysis , the limited information which will be available",
    "then will lead to strong correlations in the measurement of different higgs couplings .",
    "these correlations mask the true precision of lhc measurements when the expected errors of particular observables like individual partial widths or branching ratios are considered .",
    "the parameter correlations can be overcome by imposing theoretical constraints .",
    "one possible approach was suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite : fixing the ratio @xmath95 to its sm value , the @xmath17 measurements can be used to pin down the poorly measured higgs coupling to bottom quarks . here",
    "we follow a different approach .",
    "we perform general fits to the higgs couplings with the mildest possible theoretical assumptions , starting with the constraint @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) which is justified in any model with an arbitrary number of higgs doublets ( with or without additional higgs singlets ) .",
    "i.e. , it is true for the mssm in particular .    even without this constraint ,",
    "the mere observation of higgs production puts a lower bound on the production couplings and , thereby , on the total higgs width .",
    "the constraint @xmath98 , combined with a measurement of @xmath99 from observation of @xmath100 in wbf , then puts an upper bound on the higgs total width , @xmath32 .",
    "it is this interplay which provides powerful constraints on the remaining higgs couplings , allowing for their absolute determination , rather than simply ratios of their magnitudes .",
    "our analysis of expected lhc accuracies closely follows the work of dhrssen  @xcite .",
    "first , a parameter space ( @xmath101 ) is formed of higgs couplings together with additional partial widths to allow for undetected higgs decays and additional contributions to the loop - induced higgs couplings to photon pairs or gluon pairs due to non - sm particles running in the loops .",
    "we assume that the measured values correspond to the sm expectations for the purpose of determining statistical uncertainties , then form a log likelihood function , @xmath102 , which , for a given integrated luminosity , is based on the expected poisson errors of the channels listed in sec .",
    "[ sec : channels ] and on estimated systematic errors  @xcite , which are tabulated in the appendix .    as an alternative , in particular for the specific mssm scenarios discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mssm_specific ] , we use a gaussian approximation to the log likelihood function , i.e. , a @xmath103 function constructed from the same error assumptions that enter the log likelihood function .",
    "we take each of the channels considered in ref .",
    "@xcite as a bin in the @xmath103 . to mimic the effect of poisson statistics on channels with low numbers of events , we discard any channel with @xmath104 total events ( signal plus background ) in both approaches .",
    "this is relevant only in the case of low luminosity data .",
    "we have checked that the resulting accuracy estimates for coupling measurements are consistent for the two approaches .",
    "relative to sm expectations , we compute the variation of either @xmath105 or @xmath106 on this parameter space and trace out the surface of variations by one unit . the @xmath107 uncertainties on each parameter are determined by finding the maximum deviation of that parameter from its sm value that lies on the @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) surface .",
    "we repeat the procedure for each higgs mass value in the range @xmath110 gev in steps of 10 gev .",
    "we perform the fits under three luminosity assumptions for the lhc :    1 .",
    "30 fb@xmath24 at each of two experiments , denoted ; 2 .   300 fb@xmath24 at each of two experiments ,",
    "of which only 100 fb@xmath24 is usable for wbf channels at each experiment , denoted ; 3 .",
    "300 fb@xmath24 at each of two experiments , with the full luminosity usable for wbf channels , denoted .",
    "the second case allows for possible significant degradation of the wbf channels in a high luminosity environment , while the third case shows the benefits of additional improvements in wbf studies at high luminosity .    in both cases the higgs boson mass",
    "is not fitted , i.e. it is assumed that the mass of the higgs boson can be measured with high precision ( @xmath111 ) in @xmath57 or @xmath50 .",
    "if both of these channels go unobserved , the theoretical calculations of higgs boson brs get a large error due to the relatively low precision and larger systematic errors of mass measurements in wbf @xmath17 or @xmath112 .",
    "this is in itself not a problem for the measurement of products of higgs boson couplings , but a comparison to theoretical prediction , i.e. the upper limit on @xmath113 , will suffer considerably from this additional uncertainty .",
    "we begin by fitting for the uncertainties in the higgs couplings - squared in the most general scenario that we consider : we assume only that @xmath114 any model that contains only higgs doublets and singlets will satisfy the relations without the factor 1.05 ; the extra @xmath115 margin allows for theoretical uncertainties in the translation between couplings - squared and partial widths , and also for small admixtures of exotic higgs states , like su(2 ) triplets .",
    "we allow for the possibility of additional particles running in the loops for @xmath50 and @xmath116 , fitted by a positive or negative new partial width to these contributions .",
    "additional light hadronic decays of the higgs boson are fitted with a partial width for undetected decays .",
    "( invisible decays , e.g.  to neutralinos could still be observable  @xcite . )",
    "the results for the constraints on the new partial widths are shown in fig .",

    "the new partial width for @xmath116 is less well constrained , being less than @xmath122 of @xmath123 for 2@xmath11730  fb@xmath24 and @xmath124 for 2@xmath117300 + 2@xmath117100  fb@xmath24 over the whole range of higgs masses .",
    "the undetected partial width can be constrained to be less than @xmath125 of the total fitted higgs width for 2@xmath11730  fb@xmath24 and @xmath126 for 2@xmath117300 + 2@xmath117100  fb@xmath24 , at the @xmath107 level .",

    "for the latter case , typical accuracies range between 20 and @xmath127 for higgs masses below 150  gev . above @xmath67-pair threshold",
    "the measurement of the then - dominant @xmath128 partial widths improves to the @xmath129 level .",

    "one should note that improved selection and higher acceptance will decrease the statistical errors .",
    "at least as important is work on the reduction of systematic errors . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , the thin lines show expectations with vanishingly small systematics : systematic errors contribute up to half the total error , especially at high luminosity .    for a higgs boson mass below 140 gev the main contribution to the systematic uncertainty is the background normalization from sidebands .",
    "the largest contribution is from @xmath15 . for this channel",
    "the signal to background ratio is between 1:4 and 1:10 .",

    "there are two dominant contributions to the systematic error :    * the background normalizations in gf , wbf and @xmath29 ( systematic error @xmath115 to @xmath135 ) * the qcd uncertainty in the cross section calculations for gf ( @xmath136 ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath135 ) from given higgs boson couplings .",
    "this is especially evident in the measurement of the top coupling based on the @xmath29 channel . here",
    "the systematic uncertainties contribute half of the total error .",
    "the theoretical constraints used so far have been very moderate . if , in addition to the requirement that @xmath137 and @xmath138 , we assume that no new non - sm particles run in the loops for @xmath50 and @xmath116 ( which is approximately fulfilled for the mssm with a not too - light spectrum ) , the precision of the coupling measurements improves only slightly , with the only noticeable improvement for higgs masses below 120  gev .",
    "another small improvement comes about by restricting the @xmath67 and @xmath61 couplings to their sm ratio . within the multi - higgs - doublet models considered throughout , su(2 )",
    "symmetry relates these two couplings .",
    "it thus is natural to forgo an independent measurement of their ratio and to rather assume that @xmath139 within the mssm , this coupling ratio is indeed very close to its sm value .    over most of the mssm parameter space",
    "even the individual @xmath140 couplings will be close to their sm values since decoupling sets in rapidly once the mass of the @xmath141-odd higgs boson starts to become large , @xmath142  gev .",
    "this motivates a fit where in addition to eq .",
    "[ eq : su2 ] we assume @xmath143 we again assume that no new non - sm particles run in the loops for @xmath50 and @xmath116 . however , we fit additional higgs boson decays with a partial width for undetected decays .",

    "relaxing assumptions slightly , by allowing non - sm particles to contribute to the @xmath50 partial width , has a noticeable effect on the coupling determination only for @xmath146 gev .",
    "for example , for the 2@xmath117300 + 2@xmath117100  fb@xmath24 luminosity scenario , the precision on @xmath130 , @xmath144 and the higgs total width at @xmath147 gev jump to about @xmath127 .",
    "if the obtained higgs boson couplings differ from the sm predictions , one can investigate at what significance the sm can be excluded from lhc measurements in the higgs sector alone . as a specific example of physics beyond the sm , we consider the mssm .",
    "if supersymmetric partners of the sm particles were detected at the lhc , this would of course rule out the sm .",
    "it would nevertheless be of interest in such a situation to directly verify the non - sm nature of the higgs sector .",
    "besides the possible detection of the additional states of an extended higgs sector , a precise measurement of the couplings of the lightest ( sm - like ) higgs boson will be crucial .",
    "for the sake of brevity let us assume that the pseudoscalar higgs and the charged higgs are fairly heavy ( @xmath148  gev , and they may , but need not , have been observed directly ) so that they do not interfere with the @xmath149  signal extraction .",
    "we furthermore assume that only decays into sm particles are detected .",
    "then the light higgs that we consider here will have couplings to the @xmath67 and @xmath61 which are suppressed by the same factor @xmath150 compared to sm strength , and higgs couplings to fermions in addition depend on @xmath151 and @xmath152  @xcite , which incorporates non - universal loop corrections to the @xmath153 coupling .",
    "a fit of the higgs couplings can then be performed in terms of this reduced parameter set .",

    "we examine mssm points only for @xmath158  gev , where the narrow width approxmation is still valid .",
    "the resulting contours are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssm_contour ] for the three luminosity assumptions defined in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fitproc ] . in the areas to the left of the contours the sm can be rejected with more than @xmath82 or @xmath159 significance , respectively .",
    "the @xmath103 definition in fig .  [ fig : mssm_contour ] assumes the same systematic errors as our analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : nomodel ] .",
    "event rates and resulting statistical errors , however , are those expected for the mssm",
    ".    the source of the mssm analysis sensitivity can be understood as follows . in the @xmath155 scenario for @xmath142 gev",
    ", the couplings of @xmath149 to sm particles all essentially obtain their sm values except for the @xmath160 and @xmath161 couplings , due to the slower decoupling behavior of the latter . in this scenario the susy threshold corrections to the @xmath31 mass are also quite small , so that the ratio of the @xmath160 and @xmath161 couplings essentially takes its sm value .",
    "the @xmath162 decay mode dominates the higgs total width in this scenario .",
    "the pattern of higgs coupling deviations can then be summarized as follows : all the higgs production cross sections considered in our study are sm - like ; the partial widths into @xmath163 and @xmath164 are equally enhanced ( but with sm - like brs since the total width is dominated by @xmath163 and @xmath164 decays ) .",
    "this results in a larger total width for the higgs boson .",
    "the branching ratios into all other final states ( @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) are smaller than in the sm , reflecting this total width enhancement .",
    "we focus on the wbf channels , which have the strongest impact on the mssm fit .",
    "if systematic errors could be neglected , the well - measured wbf @xmath168 channel would give the best sensitivity to the discrepancy from the sm , since it is sensitive to the higgs branching ratio into @xmath165 .",
    "the less - well - measured wbf @xmath169 channels could be added to increase the statistics .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainties on the luminosity ( @xmath115 ) , wbf cross section ( @xmath170 ) , and forward tagging / veto jets ( @xmath115 ) hide this sensitivity to the higgs coupling deviations .",
    "these systematic uncertainties can be brought under control by including the wbf @xmath171 channel in the fit .",
    "while this channel by itself provides no sensitivity to the deviation from the sm ( because the wbf cross section and the branching ratio to taus are both sm - like ) , it serves to normalize out the systematic uncertainties .",
    "to a first approximation , this can be thought of as taking the ratio of the wbf rates with higgs decays to @xmath165 ( @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) versus @xmath164 , in which the aforementioned systematic uncertainties cancel .",
    "the @xmath103 fit of the rates in these channels offers a slight improvement over the ratio method because the systematic uncertainties are somewhat better under control .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssm_sensitivity ] we analyze the impact of the different channels included in our analysis . within the @xmath172 scenario",
    "we show the @xmath82 contours in the 2@xmath117300  fb@xmath24 luminosity scenario in the @xmath156@xmath157 plane .",
    "we plot separately the fit using only the wbf channels ( long  dashed ) , using all channels except wbf ( short  dashed ) , and the full fit ( solid ) .",
    "it becomes obvious that the wbf channels have the strongest impact .",
    "therefore it will be very helpful for this kind of analysis if the wbf channels can be fully exploited at high luminosity running .",
    "finally we would like to emphasize that the contours appear significantly different for different susy scenarios : other susy parameters can have a large effect on the relation of @xmath173 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and higgs couplings .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssm_contour2 ] , where the @xmath159 significance curves are shown in the `` gluophobic higgs '' ( left ) and the `` small @xmath174 '' ( right ) scenarios  @xcite . in the gluophobic higgs scenario the @xmath175 coupling",
    "is strongly suppressed over the whole @xmath156@xmath157 plane due to additional contributions from scalar top loops .",
    "we note that for this scenario the @xmath82 curves ( not shown ) move significantly to the left . within the small  @xmath174 scenario loop corrections",
    "can suppress the @xmath160 and @xmath161 couplings for moderate values of @xmath156 and large values of @xmath157 .",
    "both effects yield a strong deviation from the corresponding @xmath159 curves obtained in the @xmath155 scenario .",
    "it should be noted that the shown sensitivity to @xmath156 can not directly be translated into indirect bounds on @xmath156 .",
    "to establish realistic bounds , a careful analysis of the experimental errors arising from the incomplete knowledge of the spectrum of supersymmetric particles and of the theoretical uncertainties from unknown higher - order corrections is necessary .",
    "however , we observe that the contours shift only slightly if one instead uses sm rates to calculate the statistical errors .",
    "measurements of the higgs sector are expected to provide many complementary signatures after several years of lhc running .",
    "combining these measurements allows one to extract information on higgs partial widths and higgs couplings to fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "because significant contributions from unobservable channels can not easily be ruled out at the lhc , model - independent analyses produce large correlations between extracted partial widths .",
    "a reduction of correlations and hence smaller errors on particular couplings can be achieved with only very weak theory assumptions applicable to quite general higgs sector scenarios . in this paper we have analyzed the constraints expected in generic multi - higgs - doublet models , namely that @xmath176 couplings can not be larger than within the sm . within such models , the lhc can measure higgs couplings to the top quark , tau lepton , and @xmath67 and @xmath61 bosons with accuracies in the @xmath0 range once 300  fb@xmath24 of data have been collected . if , on the other hand , the slhc will be realized , one could hope for significant improvements over the results presented here .",
    "this applies in particular for the bottom yukawa coupling determination .    within the mssm",
    ", significant deviations in the higgs sector should be observable at the lhc , provided that the charged and the pseudoscalar higgs masses are not too heavy , i.e. , that decoupling is not completely realized .",
    "for example , within the @xmath155 scenario and with 300  fb@xmath24 of data , the lhc can distinguish the mssm and the sm at the @xmath159 level up to @xmath177  gev and with @xmath82 significance up to @xmath178  gev with the higgs data alone .",
    "the lhc will thus provide a surprisingly sensitive first look at the higgs sector , even though it can not match the precision and model - independence of analyses which are expected for a linear @xmath179 collider  @xcite .",
    "so far we have investigated the situation where no important channel suffers substantial suppression .",
    "however , it might be ( within supersymmetry or another extension of the sm ) that the wbf channels are degraded , or that the higgs decays more strongly to unobservable @xmath180 or @xmath181 final states .",
    "other decays like @xmath182  @xcite or @xmath183  @xcite may be detectable , or upper bounds may be put on their partial widths .",
    "channels with low statistics might be absent .",
    "finally , the mass measurement might be less precise due to a suppression of @xmath50 , thus weakening the higgs mass constraint .",
    "these scenarios are beyond the scope of this paper and will be discussed in a forthcoming publication .",
