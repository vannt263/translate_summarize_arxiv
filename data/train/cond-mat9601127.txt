    "a number of methods have been proposed for feedback control of chaos@xcite .",
    "two methods of control that stabilize an otherwise unstable periodic orbit have received considerable attention recently :    \\(a ) ott , grebogi and yorke ( ogy)@xcite introduced a method which stabilizes unstable periodic orbits ( upo s ) found in the chaotic regime via small feedback perturbations to an accessible parameter .",
    "the control perturbation is given when the orbit crosses a given poincar section , such that the trajectory will be close to the stable manifold of the desired upo . in this method , in the limit of zero noise , the orbit of the controlled system is identical to the upo of the uncontrolled system and the feedback perturbation vanishes .",
    "a drawback for the ogy method is that it becomes difficult to apply for very fast systems , since it requires computer analysis of the system at each crossing of the poincar section .",
    "also , noise can result in occasional bursts where the trajectory wanders far from the controlled periodic orbit .",
    "\\(b ) an alternative method of feedback stabilization of upo s , introduced by pyragas@xcite , consists of a continuous linear feedback applied at each computational time step . as in the ogy case ,",
    "in this method the controlled orbit coincides with the upo of the uncontrolled system and the feedback vanishes , for zero noise , when control is achieved .",
    "the feedback procedure can be applied without knowing a priori the location of the periodic orbit , for a version in which the feedback term contains a delayed variable , in which the delay corresponds to the period of the upo .",
    "moreover , it is expected that it can be used for fast systems , since no parameters are changed on a fast time - scale , and the method does not require a computer analysis of the system . for some systems , the method is robust even in the presence of considerable noise@xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of pyragas method is that it achieves control only over a limited range of the parameter space , i.e. , a given orbit will become eventually unstable in the controlled system as the parameters are varied more deeply into the chaotic regime .",
    "the use of delayed feedback also increases the dimensionality of the system .",
    "al._@xcite extended the pyragas method to include , in the control term , memory of all the previous states of the system , and were thereby able to increase the region of the parameter space where control can be achieved .",
    "the dimensionality of the system also increased in this method , to the same extent as in the method of pyragas .",
    "the desirable properties of a control system depend on the application . here",
    "we consider a system with a fixed period upo which we are attempting to control .",
    "the parameters that control the coordinates of the upo may be slowly varying compared to the upo period .",
    "the system can be considered subject to noise , which may take the system coordinates away from the periodic orbit . in this general situation",
    "we may consider the following properties of the control system as desirable : ( 1 ) in the neighborhood of the periodic orbit ( assumed stably controlled ) the actual orbit returns optimally fast to the periodic orbit when perturbed away from it ( in the limiting case the orbit is superstable ) .",
    "( 2 ) a slow drift in parameters can be tracked by the control over the largest possible parameter space .",
    "( 3 ) in the larger space we ( nonlinearly ) want the stability to be maintained over the widest range of uncertainty in either the system parameters or the dynamical variables ( basin of attraction ) caused by noise .",
    "( 4 ) in some average sense , we wish to minimize the time required to return to the desired solution from the basin of attraction ( in the nonlinear regime ) .    in the next section",
    "we examine these criteria for control of a fixed point of a mapping corresponding to a periodic solution of a continuous system , with a known period .",
    "we use the well studied logistic map as the test bed for the study . here",
    "we introduce modifications to the control methods of pyragas and socolar , using a nonlinear function in the feedback term . as in the ogy , pyragas and socolar methods ,",
    "the stabilized orbit is identical to the upo of the uncontrolled system , and when control is achieved the magnitude of the feedback term vanishes in the absence of noise .",
    "first we compare the linear control of pyragas to an analogous nonlinear control .",
    "next , we compare the case in which memory is introduced into the mapping parameters with case in which memory is introduced into the nonlinear control . in section  [ s3 ]",
    "we introduce a special case of nonlinear control with memory , that reduces to a remarkable simple form , whose properties are generally better than the other cases examined . we show that this latter control can be used efficiently to control other periodic points and higher dimensional mappings .",
    "we start by describing pyragas method@xcite .",
    "he considered a dynamical system that is governed by ordinary differential equations , which are in principle unknown .",
    "however , some scalar variable @xmath0 can be measured as a system output , and the system also has an input available for an external force @xmath1 .",
    "these assumptions can be met by the following model , @xmath2 where * x * describes the remaining variables of the dynamical system which are not available for observation or not of interest .",
    "the forcing term disturbs only the variable @xmath0 , and it is assumed that the system may be in the chaotic regime when the forcing term @xmath3 is zero .",
    "pyragas studied two types of forcing . in the first method one determines the upo @xmath4 of the chaotic attractor from @xmath5 , following well known algorithms@xcite .",
    "then one designs an oscillator that has an orbit equal to that of @xmath4 .",
    "the forcing term is given in this case by @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 is an empirically adjustable weight of the perturbation .",
    "in the other type of forcing considered by pyragas , the forcing term contains a delayed term of the variable @xmath0 , namely , @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the delay time .",
    "if the delay time coincides with period of the @xmath10-th upo then the perturbation @xmath3 vanishes and @xmath5 will coincide with upo , as in the first case .",
    "however , in this last case , one does not need to know the upo , just its period , nor is it necessary to design an external oscillator .",
    "[ although pyragas described his method for the situation in which one knows only a time series , in all the cases he studied the equations that described the system were known . ] here we are concerned with the second method , i.e. , the delayed feedback case .",

    "however , for the same value of @xmath20 the nonlinear control with @xmath94 is less robust than the case with @xmath68 , which is shown in fig .",

    "<S> we generalize a method of control of chaos which uses delayed feedback at the period of an unstable orbit to stabilize that orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the generalization consists of substituting some portion of the nonlinear dynamical system with a delayed dynamics , rather than using a linear delay function for control . </S>",
    "<S> a further generalization , in which the control function retains memory of all previous periods , allows the region of the parameter space over which control can be achieved to be extended , but at the price of losing the ability to achieve superstability . </S>",
    "<S> nonliner feedback results in a larger basin of attraction to the stabilized orbit than linear feedback . for a simple test mapping studied ( the logistic map ) the dimension of the system increases from one to two by introducing control . </S>",
    "<S> we show in the case involving memory , for a particular choice of the relationship between the control parameters , that the superstable orbit can be recovered without reducing the parameter space that can be controlled . </S>",
    "<S> this particular solution , in addition to having the largest basin of attraction of the methods considered , retains the dimension of the uncontrolled system . </S>"
