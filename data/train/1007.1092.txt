    "during the last decade , it has been shown that all adherent cell types sense and respond to mechanical cues in their environment , including substrate stiffness and prestress @xcite .",
    "for example , fibroblast - like cells adhere stronger to stiffer substrates , including decreased motility , increase in spreading area and higher contractile forces .",
    "most strikingly , the fate of stem cells can be controled by substrate stiffness @xcite .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that mechanosensing by tissue cells is not based on the functioning of one particular molecular entity , but depends on the dynamical function of a mechanosensitive system whose main components are actomyosin force generation and signaling from cell - matrix adhesions @xcite .",
    "for example , all the described effects are abolished by inhibiting myosin ii activity by blebbistatin or the rho - pathway by c3-toxin . here",
    "we perform a systems - level analysis of rigidity sensing by tissue cells taking into account both the mechanical and biochemical aspects .",
    "our model is sketched in ( a ) .",
    "cell mechanics is represented by a viscoelastic model for a stress fiber ( sf ) , which is the most prominent feature of the actin cytoskeleton developed in cell culture on flat substrates .",
    "the parallel arrangement of elastic and viscous elements leads to a kelvin - voigt element , that is the sf behaves like a solid on long time scales .",
    "in addition to the passive viscoelastic stress , we account for active actomyosin contractility .",
    "the myosin forces are determined by a force velocity relation whose properties are modulated by biochemical signals diffusing in the cytoplasm . therefore actomyosin contractility may vary spatially along the fiber . in the continuum limit of many elements in series , we arrive at a continuous kelvin - voigt material governed by a partial differential equation with mixed derivatives , the stress fiber equation @xcite .",
    "the forces generated in the sf are transmitted to integrin - based cell - matrix adhesions , so - called focal adhesions ( fas ) , where they trigger biochemical signals feeding back to the actin cytoskeleton .",
    "the main mechanism which has been suggested in this context is the force - induced activation of the rho signaling pathway through guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( gefs ) that reside in fas @xcite .",
    "activation of rhoa leads to activation of the rho - associated kinase ( rock ) .",
    "active rock is able to phosphorylate myosin light chain phosphatase ( mlcp ) to mlcp - p and thereby deactivates the phosphatase .",
    "mlcp and mlcp - p are freely diffusible in the cytoplasm and can reach the myosins in the sfs . increased phosphorylation of mlcp to mlcp - p by rock thus effectively leads to increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain ( mlc ) , increasing myosin contractility along the sfs . in our model , this signaling pathway is described by a system of reaction diffusion equations where each enzymatic step is described by michaelis - menten kinectics @xcite .",
    "the actomyosin force is assumed to activate the rho - pathway with michaelis - menten kinetics .",
    "this is the simplest assumption given a linear increase in biochemical activity at small force and saturation at large force .",
    "the biochemical signal couples into the sf contraction mechanics via the force velocity relation of the myosin motors . in this way",
    ", a mechanical and biochemical positive feedback loop is closed as depicted in ( b ) .",
    "the mechano - chemical model has been introduced before to describe inhomogeneous sf contraction upon myosin stimulation by the drug calyculin @xcite . to account for compliant substrates ,",
    "we now appropriately modify the boundary conditions of the sf equation .",
    "in this situation , at each fiber end the traction forces @xmath0 exerted by the sf have to be balanced by the elastic restoring forces of the substrate .",
    "the latter is modeled as a linear elastic spring of stiffness @xmath1 .",
    "all model equations and parameter values are summarized in the supplement .",
    "motivated by their experimental relevance , we start with a bifurcation analysis with the non - dimensional ratio of substrate and sf stiffness @xmath2 and the stimulation strength @xmath3 as control parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 accounts for the inhibitory effects of calyculin on mlcp : @xmath4 corresponds to an unperturbed system and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) lead to higher ( lower ) actomyosin activity . as state variable",
    "we introduce the absolute value of the exerted traction forces , @xmath7 .",
    "an alternative choice is the substrate deformation @xmath8 , see supplemental results .    shows the bifurcation diagram for the traction force @xmath0 as a function of the stiffness ratio @xmath2 for different values of the stimulation strength @xmath3 . for each value of @xmath3 ,",
    "the upper blue and the lower red branch represent the stable fixed points for different values of the stiffness ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the unstable branch is indicated as dashed line .",
    "the s - shape of these curves demonstrates that the system is strongly bistable due to the positive feedback between force and signaling .",
    "the stable upper branch corresponds to a highly contractile cell whereas the stable lower branch corresponds to an inactive cell that fails to establish a contractile state .",
    "both branches increase monotonically with substrate stiffness .",
    "however , the upper branch quickly saturates for high stiffness ratios .",
    "it can be deduced from that for all considered values of @xmath3 there exist a critical stiffness ratio , defined by the left bifurcation point , below which the upper stable branch vanishes . as a consequence , on very soft substrates",
    ", cells can not establish a highly contractile state .",
    "correspondingly on the stiff side there exists a threshold above which unperturbed cells are always contractile .    by systematically sampling the 2d parameter space ,",
    "the stable and unstable branches become surfaces defined over the @xmath9@xmath10 plane as shown in .",
    "the two folds where the surface bends over itself define two bifurcation curves representing the two thresholds involved .",
    "their projection on the parameter plane , shown as dashed lines , yields the stability diagram of the system .",
    "the curves divide the plane into three regions , namely inactive , contractile or bistable .",
    "if the system is driven out of the bistable region by a parameter change , it can be forced to a sudden transition between the inactive and the contractile states .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the experimentally observed abrupt appearance of mature sfs in 3t3 fibroblasts if the substrate stiffness is increased beyond a threshold value of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "cells also spread faster on stiff substrates @xcite which corresponds to a faster buildup of forces as predicted by our model , see fig .",
    "the course of spreading experiments is indicated by upward arrows in .",
    "however , they can not reach the upper stable branch in the bistable region .",
    "our results suggest that this state can be attained by stimulated cells after washout of calyculin , as indicated by the downward arrows in .",
    "an important consequence of the bistability revealed by our bifurcation analysis is the existence of a hysteresis loop for cell adhesion .",
    "to construct such a hysteresis cycle , cells had to be prepared on stiff substrates in the highly contractile state , compare . by reducing the substrate stiffness sufficiently slowly , such that the system can adapt and remain in a quasi - steady state",
    ", it will follow the upper stable branch until it reaches the left bifurcation point . here",
    ", the upper branch becomes unstable and the system is forced into the inactive state .",
    "when the control parameter is increased again , the system will stay on the lower branch while it reaches the right bifurcation point , where the lower branch becomes unstable .",
    "thus , the system is finally forced again onto the upper branch and the hysteresis cycle is closed .",
    "the ideal hysteresis scenario is expected to occur only for very slow changes in stiffness . in experiments",
    ", rate effects might occur .",
    "to analyze this situation theoretically , we now can take full advantage of our dynamical model .",
    "we have simulated this experiment with comsol multiphysics for a stiffness ratio @xmath12 which oscillates sinusoidally between @xmath13 and @xmath14 with different periods @xmath15 .",
    "this stiffness range is chosen such that it covers the bistable region .",
    "the resulting time courses for the traction forces are shown in . as an inset",
    "we show the encircled hysteresis area as a function of the period @xmath15 .",
    "for very large periods ( @xmath16 ) , the system follows essentially the bifurcation diagram .",
    "the area of the hysteresis cycle first increases with the frequency and reaches a maximum for @xmath17 , the red curve in .",
    "for very high frequencies the hysteresis cycle tightens up again as the period of the mechanical input becomes smaller than the relaxation time of the biochemical system . in this case , the biochemical part of the system conserves the initial activation and thus , the system can maintain higher forces on soft substrates , leading to a rather flat time course of the traction forces , compare @xmath18 in .",
    "a bifurcation analysis of our dynamical systems model showed that the described positive mechano - chemical feedback cycle leads to bistability for contraction as a function of substrate stiffness .",
    "this readily explains the experimentally observed abrupt change in the morphology and contractility of fibroblast - like cells at a rigidity threshold . due to its dynamical nature",
    ", our model also allows us to predict the different hysteresis curves expected for different frequencies of dynamically changing substrate stiffness .",
    "recently different experimental setups have been introduced which make cell experiments on substrates with time - dependent stiffness possible .",
    "hydrogels made from thiolated hyaluronic acid and polyethylene glycol diacrylate exhibits a time - dependent increase in the young modulus @xcite .",
    "the stiffness can be reduced again by breaking formed disulfide bonds with dithiothreitol .",
    "alternatively , micromanipulation systems like afms or microplates can be used to mimic compliant substrates through an electronic feedback system @xcite .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that such dynamical protocols open up a new dimension of controling cell behaviour through physical cues . here",
    ", we have restricted our treatment to a single fiber as a paradigm as to how cells couple biochemistry and mechanics .",
    "future work should also address how different fibers interact with each other .",
    "fibers in the same cell should share the biochemical input through diffusion fields , while all fibers ( including those from other cells ) might interact mechanically through a compliant substrate .                    ,",
