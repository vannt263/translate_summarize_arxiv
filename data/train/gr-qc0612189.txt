    "in the year 1933 leon lichtenstein published a book entitled `` gleichgewichtsfiguren rotierender flssigkeiten '' ( `` equilibrium figures of rotating fluids '' ) in which he collected his work on this topic , published in mathematische zeitschrift in the years 1905  1928 .",
    "lichtenstein showed existence of solutions of the nonlinear pdes describing rotating fluids in various configurations under the influence of newtonian gravity .",
    "the simplest configurations are : one axisymmetric rigidly rotating fluid ball and two self - gravitating fluid balls in circular motion around their center of gravity .",
    "more complicated configurations treated are toroidal rings or even families of nested rings .",
    "all these problems have in common that the equations become time independent in a corotating system and that they express the balance of gravitational , centrifugal and pressure forces .",
    "of particular importance is that the total force and torque on the bodies must vanish .",
    "lichtensteins method is  in modern language  the implicit function theorem in the context of bifurcation theory . in one class of problems",
    "he begins with an exact non rotating solution and finds a nearby solution with small angular velocity .",
    "more interesting are the cases with several bodies .",
    "starting from two point particles on a circular orbit around their center of gravity , one `` puts two small homogeneous fluid bodies on these orbits '' : this is no solution to the equation , however for a small body the error is small enough to begin an iteration which converges to an exact solution .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that basically all configurations lichtenstein treated can also be successfully studied if the bodies are made of elastic material .",
    "the case of one slowly rotating elastic body was studied in [ 1 ] . in this paper",
    "we treat : firstly , one elastic body in circular motion in the gravitational field of some central mass which is kept fixed .",
    "secondly , two bodies in circular motion around their common center of gravity under their mutual newtonian gravitational field .    we also deal with a static problem , where one small body is near a non - degenerate equilibrium point of a given gravitational field - such as that in the center of a hollow triaxial cylinder , ( iv ) like ( iii ) - with the mutual interaction and self - interaction of both bodies taken into account .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews elastostatics ; quotes properties of the elasticity operator and formulates the equations for general `` force functionals '' . in section 3",
    "we discuss various types of forces , which in particular include centifugal and gravitational forces .",
    "section 4 contains the main application , the motion of a body in an external gravitational field and the motion of two bodies under their gravitational attraction .",
    "section 5 is in a way separate from the main theme of rotating bodies .",
    "it shows , that the techniques developed can be used to demonstrate the existence of newtonian static two  body solutions for particular geometries of the bodies .",
    "this possibility had always been conjectured , but the existence of a full pde solutions had not been demonstrated .",
    "in this section we recall the setup of nonrelativistic elastostatics .",
    "we are using the material representation where elastic states are decribed by deformations , i.e. maps from material space , the `` body '' , to physical space .",

    "condition eq.([stressfree ] ) will mean that the reference state @xmath8 has vanishing stress .",

    "given a functional @xmath65 , we will try to solve ( [ equ ] ) by the implicit function theorem .",
