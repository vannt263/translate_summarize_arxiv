    "the most common interpretation of this quantity is the average ( over time and the phase space ) one - step gain of information about the initial state . in 1997 , frank blume proposed @xcite to analyze zero entropy dynamical systems by observing convergence rate of @xmath12 to the dynamical entropy of @xmath2 for certain classes of finite partitions of @xmath13 . in subsequent works @xcite he obtained several results characterizing the rate of convergence for completely ergodic and rank one systems .",
