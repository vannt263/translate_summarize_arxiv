    "suppression of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) with adaptive beamforming is widely used in radio astronomy , radar and telecommunications . the main idea behind many algorithms proposed for use in radio astronomy consists of weighting the outputs of array elements in such a way as to create zero values in the synthesized array pattern in the direction of rfi and to keep the signal of interest ( soi ) , the radio source to be observed , in the maximum of the main lobe without significant loss of gain @xcite . during recent years",
    "there has been a growing interest in radio astronomy for applying these methods of rfi mitigation both to existing radio telescopes and to future generation projects .",
    "there are several specific features of the large connected radio interferometers ( ri ) used in radio astronomy such as westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) , very large array ( vla ) and giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) which make the straightforward application of this adaptive beam - forming different and difficult when compared to classic phased arrays :    \\1 .",
    "connected ri are highly sparse arrays .",
    "their main mode of operation is correlation processing .",
    "direction of arrival ( doa ) of a signal of interest is a known and time - dependent vector .",
    "there is no computer - controlled amplitude weighting in the existing ri backend hardware .",
    "there is an auxiliary _ tied - array _ facility which is used during vlbi and pulsar observations .",
    "the mode of observation is similar to that of standard phase arrays : the signals from the antennas are added but without amplitude weighting , because the antennas of ri are identical .",
    "there is a phase - only control allowing coherent adding .",
    "the ri works as a  single dish \" .",
    "noise - like radio source signals are usually much weaker than system noise ( antenna + receiver ) and rfi .",
    "phase - only adaptive nulling is proposed for rfi mitigation during tied - array observations .",
    "small phase perturbations are introduced to the signals of every antenna .",
    "the values of these perturbations are optimized in such a way that the signal from soi is preserved and the rfi signals suppressed .",
    "this techniques has been widely discussed @xcite and is well suited to tied - array observations .",
    "there are two approaches to adaptive beam - forming : narrow - band ( complex weighting of amplitudes and phases ) and wide - band ( digital filtering , delay - tap weighting ) . the narrow - band approach will be used in the following text .",
    "let us consider an equidistant m - element linear array .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional array output vector @xmath1 , as a function of an angle , i. e. , the complex amplitude of the temporal signal @xmath2 consists of the following components : @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the signal vector corresponding to  the plane wave coming from the direction @xmath5 is the @xmath6th rfi vector , coming from any direction @xmath7 is the system noise vector .",
    "these three components are uncorrelated .",
    "vector @xmath4 depends on the incidence angle @xmath8 of the plane wave , measured with respect to the normal to linear array @xmath9^{t}\\ ] ] where phase shift @xmath10 is the spacing between array elements , @xmath11 is the wavelength . the phase of the first antenna is chosen to be equal to 0 .",
    "the beamformer , in general , consists of the complex weights @xmath12 which form the beamformer vector @xmath13 @xmath14^{t}.\\ ] ] the output of the phased array is @xmath15 the beamformer should satisfy both following requirements :    \\a ) _ steering capability _ : the soi is protected ( @xmath16 , for a prescribed direction @xmath17 the response of the array is constant regardless of what values are assigned to the weights @xmath13 ;    \\b ) the effects of rfi should be minimized .",
    "the _ minimum - variance distortionless response _ ( mvdr ) beamforming algorithm , subject to this constraint when @xmath18 is proposed in order to minimize the variance of the beamformer output@xcite .",
    "the solution for @xmath13 in this case is @xmath19^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the correlation matrix of @xmath21    as was mentioned in the introduction , wsrt and other large radio astronomy arrays can not use this algorithm in real time with the existing equipment because there are no amplitude control facilities .",
    "that is to say that `` rfi nulling '' is limited to _ phase - only _ control .",
    "phase - only weights can be found to be the solution to the following system of nonlinear equations :    @xmath22    @xmath23 are the weights in our phase - only case .",
    "the vector @xmath24 is known and is determined by the soi coordinates .",
    "the construction of the @xmath25 vector requires the knowledge of rfi s doa , which may be known beforehand or could be obtained from  the observed correlation matrix  @xmath26 , because soi is always much weaker than rfi .",
    "but it is necessary to have a special correlator for this purpose in order to follow all rapid scintillations of rfi which are usually averaged by the main radio interferometer correlator .",
    "so , in principle , the system of equations ( 6 - 9 ) can be solved and the phase corrections @xmath27 introduced into the phase control system . the optimal solution ( 5 ) can be used as a zero approximation for @xmath28 the difficulties in implementing the solution of the system ( 6 - 9 ) are not mentioned here .",
    "a more practical method of calculating the phase corrections @xmath27 in the tied array case is proposed here .",
    "the tied array total power detector output ( @xmath29 ) is @xmath30^{2}dt>=tpd_{sig}+tpd_{rfi}+tpd_{n},\\ ] ]    where the total power components @xmath31 correspond to the soi , rfi and system noise , respectively , @xmath32 means the statistical expectation .",
    "the mean value of the signal component is @xmath33dt\\right\\}^{2 } > , \\ ] ] the mean value of the n - th rfi component is @xmath34dt\\right\\}^{2 } > , \\ ] ] the mean value of the system noise component is constant .",
    "we assume also that @xmath35 and the different @xmath36 are uncorrelated .    considering the tpd output as a function of @xmath0 variables",
    "@xmath37 the following criterium for a `` good '' vector @xmath38^{t}$ ] can be proposed : @xmath39 the denominator @xmath40 is the total tpd output under the assumption @xmath41 the numerator @xmath42 can be calculated for each given @xmath43 and @xmath8 ( the doa of soi ) . therefore ,",
    "maximizing @xmath44 with a proper choice of @xmath43 , a higher signal - to - rfi - plus - noise ratio at the tied array output can be achieved .",
    "this is a classic @xmath0-variable optimization problem which is difficult to solve by the common gradient methods because of the multimodality of @xmath45 there are many local ( secondary ) maximums and a searching algorithm will `` get stuck '' at one of them without finding the global maximum .",
    "genetic algorithms ( ga ) search the solution for the set of variables through the use of simulated evolution , i.e. , _ survival of the fittest _ strategy .",
    "in contrast to the gradient algorithms which are , in general , calculus - based algorithms , ga , first introduced by @xcite , exploits a _ guided random techniques _ during optimization procedure @xcite .",
    "the multimodality problem is successfully overcome by this algorithm .",
    "a simplified block diagram of ga implementation in a radio interferometer is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "a phase control subsystem introduces a certain initial phase distribution @xmath46 corresponding to radio source coordinates and preliminary phase calibration corrections .",
    "the output of the tpd is then continiously measured and used to supply the ga program with the data ( cost function samples ) which monitor the performance of the tied array with respect to rfi .",
    "the ga uses these data to calculate new phases @xmath47 with the aim to maximize @xmath48 these new phases are introduced into the phase control subsystem after each iteration and a new value of the tpd output signal is used for the next step .",
    "thus the feedback loop , _ phase control subsystem - tpd - ga _ , maintains the low value of @xmath49 and therefore the high value of the fitness function @xmath44 , i. e. , the high signal - to - rfi ratio .",
    "computer simulation was performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the phase - only nulling in rfi mitigation .",
    "first , a 14-element half - wavelength linear array was modelled .",
    "the soi direction is equal to @xmath50 and there are two rfi signals : one at the angle @xmath51 , and the other at the angle @xmath52 figure 2 shows in logarithmic scale the quiescent ( dash line ) and adapted ( solid line ) array patterns .",
    "the significant suppression of rfi with the adapted pattern is clearly visible , while the quiescent pattern has the secondary lobe maximums at the rfi positions .",
    "figure 3 shows the corresponding array phase distribution .",
    "sparse 14-element array patterns are represented in figures 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 .",
    "the distance between the elements is @xmath53 and the central frequency is @xmath54 .",
    "the lobes are much narrower than for the half - wavelength array , so the different figures are given to illustrate the result of phase - only nulling .",
    "figure 4 ( a linear scale presentation of the pattern ) is given here to illustrate the loss and distortions of the main lobe .",
    "this is more visible in the linear scale , whereas rfi suppression is better seen in the logarithmic scale .",
    "5 - the quiescent and adapted patterns around angle @xmath50 logarithmic scale , figures 6 , 7 - the same patterns around the directions of rfi1 ( doa@xmath55 and rfi2 ( doa@xmath56 the corresponding array phase distribution is shown in fig .",
    "the subsequent figures illustrate this phase - only nulling for a two - dimensional planar array .",
    "adaptive nulling was simulated for the half - wavelength array with 10x10 elements , the central frequency is equal to @xmath54 .",
    "rectangular coordinates @xmath57 and @xmath58 are angles measured from the @xmath59 and @xmath60 axes , respectively , to the line from the array to the radio source ; thus the soi is at the zenith , with coordinates @xmath61 coordinates of rfi were chosen so as to put them on the maximums of the secondary lobes , the values of rfi suppression are shown in the captions .",
    "the following sequence of figures is given :    figure 9 : normalized ( a(@xmath62=1 ) quiescent array with indicated rfi positions ;    figure 10 : array s pattern after adaptation ;    figure 11 : this array s phase distribution after adaptation .",
    "\\1 . existing large radio interferometers ( wsrt , vla , gmrt ) have only phase control facilities and the _ real - time _ adaptive nulling in the rfi direction should take this constraint into account .",
