    "transition state theory ( tst ) provides the conceptual framework for large parts of reaction rate theory .",
    "originally developed to describe the reactivity of small molecules,@xcite it was later extended to encompass a wide variety of processes in different branches of science , whose only commonality is a transition from well - defined `` reactant '' to `` product '' states.@xcite the reason for this success is that tst proposes a simple answer to the two central problems of reaction dynamics : it identifies a reaction mechanism , and provides at the same time a simple approximation to the reaction rate .",
    "more specifically , tst is based on the observation that the rate limiting step in many reactions is the crossing of an energetic barrier .",
    "the top of this barrier then forms a bottleneck in the phase space of the reactive system .",
    "a reaction can only take place if the barrier is crossed .",
    "if a dividing surface ( ds ) between reactant and product regions of phase space is placed close to the bottleneck , the reaction rate can be computed from the steady - state flux through that surface .",
    "a strictly recrossing free ds can be constructed in the phase space of reactive systems with arbitrarily many degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the simplest approximation to the rate is then obtained under the assumption that reactive classical trajectories cross the ds only once and never return .",
    "this assumption is often appropriate for reactions in the gas phase if the ds is adequately chosen , but even then many reactions strongly violate this assumption .",
    "moreover , if the system is strongly coupled to an environment , for example a liquid solvent , the no - recrossing assumption is usually impossible to enforce strictly , and often any ds is crossed many times by a typical trajectory . as a result , a tst rate calculation significantly overestimates the reaction rate .",
    "for this reason , the focus of tst has long been to construct a ds that eliminates or at least minimizes recrossings ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "the recrossing problem can be solved if the reactive trajectories that contribute to the rate can be identified reliably .",
    "an obvious means to this end is the numerical simulation of representative trajectories under the influence of the environment .",
    "however , such calculations are usually very time consuming .",
    "the advantage of the tst approximation is its simplicity .",
    "it identifies reactive trajectories simply by noting that they cross the ds from the reactant to the product side .",
    "this criterion , which fails if recrossing can not be ruled out , is easy to use because it only takes account of the instantaneous velocity with which a trajectory crosses the ds .",
    "nevertheless , it raises the prospect of a criterion to identify reactive trajectories simply from their initial conditions , without the need to study their time evolution . in the present paper",
    "we will derive such a criterion and demonstrate how it can be used in a rate calculation .",
    "the langevin equation has been widely used to model the interaction of a reactive system with a surrounding heat bath.@xcite being a classical model , this description neglects quantum effects such as barrier tunnelling , which can be important in the case of light particles @xcite , and the interaction with excited surfaces through conical intersections @xcite . in this",
    "setting , kramers@xcite explicit derived expressions for the rate of escape across a parabolic barrier that apply separately in the limits of weak and strong damping .",
    "the generalized langevin equation is equivalent to a hamiltonian model in which the reactive system is bilinearly coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators.@xcite this reformulation allowed extensions of kramers rate theory that apply to situations with arbitrary friction@xcite or that include corrections due to anharmonic barriers.@xcite in this respect , it has long been predicted that the rates of activated processes should rise with the coupling to the solvent in the weak coupling regime .",
    "however , its direct observation in particle - based models had been elusive because the coupling typically places the processes in the spatial - diffusion limited regime wherein rates decrease with increasing friction .",
    "recently , the kramers turnover in the rate with microscopic friction has been observed in molecular dynamics trajectories calculation of the linc@xmath0licn in a bath of ar atoms.@xcite this observation provided direct and unambiguous evidence for the energy - diffusion regime in which rates increase with friction . in the present work we will not consider any explicit hamiltonian model for the heat bath ; its influence will instead be described by means of a langevin equation .",
    "this approach allows to work within the finite - dimensional phase space of the reactive system alone , rather than the infinite - dimensional phase space of the bath .",
    "this is advantageous from a computational point of view and also conceptually convenient because the phase space is easier to visualize in low dimension .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe the geometric phase space structures that allow to classify a trajectory as reactive or nonreactive just by looking at its initial condition , thus avoiding the need of carrying out a numerical simulation . because the fate of a trajectory with a given initial condition depends on the external force to which it is exposed",
    ", any such criterion must take account of the precise realization of that force . a general framework to do that was proposed in a recent series of papers,@xcite including the identification of reactive trajectories  @xcite and the rate calculation  @xcite .",
    "it was there shown that the langevin equation gives rise to a specific trajectory called the transition state ( ts ) trajectory that remains in the vicinity of the energetic barrier for all times , without ever descending into any of the potential wells .",
    "this ts trajectory depends on the realization of the noise , and takes over the role of the fixed saddle point in the conventional tst . a crucial observation in refs .   for the case of a harmonic barrier",
    "is that the dynamics described by the langevin equation become noiseless when expressed in a time - dependent coordinate system for which the ts  trajectory is the moving origin . in the system of relative",
    "coordinates it is easy to identify a tst ds that is rigorously free from recrossing .",
    "it gives rise to a ds in the original , space fixed coordinate system that is still recrossing - free .",
    "this ds is time - dependent since it is attached to the ts  trajectory , and it moves through phase space with it .",
    "even more significantly , this construction yields surfaces in phase space that separate reactive from nonreactive trajectories .",
    "these surfaces are the stable and unstable manifolds of the ts  trajectory , and they also depend on time and on the realization of the noise . once they are known , initial conditions on one side of the surface are immediately classified as reactive , while those on the other side are nonreactive .",
    "thus , the existence of these invariant manifolds solves the diagnostic problem of standard rate theory that was explained above .",
    "they were used in ref .   to obtain a compact rate formula , strictly valid only for harmonic barriers",
    "ad hoc _ application to systems with an anharmonic barrier produced , however , promising results.@xcite    in the present paper , we develop a rigorous generalization of the time - dependent tst formalism applicable to anharmonic barriers using perturbation theory .",
    "we show that the invariant manifolds persist in anharmonic systems and , more importantly , they retain the ability to distinguish between reactive and nonreactive trajectories , thus determining the chemical reactivity of the system .",
    "finally , a simple perturbative scheme that allows one to calculate the invariant manifolds for a specific anharmonic potential barrier will be presented , and it will be used to obtain an analytic expansion for the reaction rate . in the first part of the paper , we restrict our study to the one - dimensional case . in this situation , the finite barrier corrections that were obtained in refs .",
    "will be recovered .",
    "we have already given a brief account of these results in ref .  .",
    "we will here supply the details of the calculation that could not be presented within the confines of a communication .",
    "we will then introduce the modifications to the theory that are necessary to accommodate multidimensional reactive systems .",
    "the efficacy of our method is demonstrated by deriving the first and second order corrections to the reaction rate in the two - dimensional model potential already used in refs .  .",
    "a final point is worth commenting on in this introduction .",
    "perturbative rate calculations on multidimensional anharmonic barriers have also been recently reported in refs .  .",
    "as in the present work , these authors based their work on the identification of the ts  trajectory for the harmonic limit in refs .  .",
    "our work , however , goes beyond those previous results in two main respects .",
    "first , and most importantly , it provides an explicit and detailed description of the invariant geometric structures in phase space that govern the reaction dynamics , rather than studying them implicitly through approximate invariants and their imprint on an ensemble of trajectories .",
    "second , whereas the normal form procedure in refs .   aims at constructing a coordinate system in which the dynamics in the neighborhood of the barrier can be simplified in general terms , we derive a version of the perturbation theory that is specifically directed at calculating the invariant manifolds that are relevant to reaction rate theory .",
    "this perturbative scheme can therefore be much simpler , and permits the analytical computation of corrections to kramers transmission factor for anharmonic potentials .",
    "indeed , the calculation of the invariant manifolds can be easily carried out by hand , whereas a normal form transformation always requires computer assitance .",
    "this ease of computation makes the invariant manifolds an attractive tool for practical rate calculations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : ratesintro ]",
    "we present the basic definitions and results of rate theory that will be used to develop our method .",
    "section  [ sec : tdmf ] is devoted to a qualitative description of the invariant manifolds that give structure to the dynamics in the vicinity of an energy barrier , and section  [ sec : perturb1d ] presents a method for their calculation . in section  [ sec : rate ] a general expression for the reaction rate in the case of an anharmonic barrier is derived . a description of the statistical properties of the invariant manifolds that are required to evaluate the rate formula , the perturbative and numerical results for various one - dimensional potentials are also given .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:2d ] we discuss the modifications to the foregoing developments that are required in multidimensional systems , and we also present results for the reaction rate on an anharmonic two - dimensional barrier .",
    "in this section we outline the fundamentals of reaction rate theory that will be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "the reader is referred to refs .   for more details .",
    "we assume that the reactant and product regions in configuration space are separated by a ds that is characterized by the value @xmath1 of a generalized reaction coordinate @xmath2 , which we choose such that the product region is given by @xmath3 .",
    "the reaction rate is then given by the flux - over - population expression @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the average population of the reactant region and @xmath6 is the reactive flux out of that region .",
    "here , @xmath7 denotes the velocity component perpendicular to the ds , @xmath8 the coordinates within the surface and @xmath9 the corresponding velocities .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath10 takes the value  1 if the trajectory starting at @xmath11 is reactive , i.e. , moves to products for large times , and  0 otherwise .",
    "its purpose is to ensure that only reactive trajectories contribute to the reactive flux .",
    "the average in eq .   extends over the realizations , @xmath12 , of the external noise and over a thermal equilibrium ensemble of initial conditions that are constrained to lie on the ds .",
    "the latter ensemble is described by a probability density function @xmath13 which includes a boltzmann distribution of the velocities @xmath7 and a boltzmann distribution @xmath14 of the transverse coordinates and velocities .",
    "the factor  @xmath15 in eq .   is the partition function of the transverse motion .",
    "it ensures that @xmath16 in eq .",
    "we have used mass - scaled coordinates and we have left out an overall normalization factor . in particular , we did not include the arrhenius factor @xmath17 that includes the activation energy @xmath18 of the reaction .",
    "the overall normalization of the distribution function is well understood , and it is irrelevant to the calculation of the transmission factor   below , on which we will focus in this work . for simplicity , we can therefore work with the unnormalized distribution function  .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath19 in eq .   encodes the entire complexity of the reaction dynamics on an anharmonic barrier .",
    "the main task of a reaction rate calculation is to evaluate this function . in general , this can only be achieved by a numerical simulation .",
    "a simple approximation to this crucial ingredient is provided by tst .",
    "it assumes that no trajectory can cross the ds more than once . as a consequence ,",
    "every trajectory that crosses the ds from the reactant to the product side must be reactive , every trajectory that crosses in the opposite direction must be nonreactive . to implement this approximation",
    ", we replace the characteristic function in eq .   by @xmath20",
    "this gives rise to the tst approximation to the rate constant @xmath21 in which the average over the noise @xmath12 can be suppressed because @xmath22 does not depend on it .",
    "when the no - recrossing assumption of tst is not satisfied , the approximation   will overestimate the rate , often by a large factor . to quantify the effects of non - tst behavior , a transmission factor ,",
    "@xmath23 is introduced that relates the exact rate to the tst approximation .",
    "it can be obtained from the ratio of the flux across the barrier to its tst approximation : @xmath24 to evaluate   numerically , one can randomly sample initial conditions and noise sequences from the appropriate ensembles , and simulate the behavior of each trajectory until its energy is so far below the barrier top that it can be regarded as having been thermalized on either the reactant or the product side of the barrier . the trajectory can then be classified as reactive or non - reactive depending on what state it reached .",
    "all numerical results presented in this work were obtained in this way .",
    "this algorithm is conceptually straight - forward , but computationally costly",
    ". it would be highly desirable to find a criterion that allows one to identify the reactive trajectories without having to carry out a numerical simulation .",
    "the following sections will describe the phase space structures that will provide such a criterion .",
    "we begin by specifying the model that will be used .",
    "the langevin equation describes the reduced dynamics of a low - dimensional system coupled to an external heat bath.@xcite it is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an @xmath5 dimensional vector of mass - scaled coordinates , @xmath27 is the potential of mean force , @xmath28 is a symmetric positive - definite @xmath29 matrix of damping constants , and @xmath30 is the fluctuating force exerted by the heat bath .",
    "it is connected to the friction matrix @xmath28 by the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath33 is the temperature . throughout most of this work ,",
    "we consider a one - dimensional problem in which the friction matrix @xmath28 simply reduces to a scalar @xmath34 , and the position vector @xmath26 contains a single coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "if we expand the potential of mean force around its saddle point , we can write it as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a formal perturbation parameter that serves only to keep track of the orders of perturbation theory , and finally will be set to @xmath37 . for the mean force itself",
    "we write @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the anharmonic parts of the force .      because the langevin expression   is a second order differential equation ,",
    "its phase space is two - dimensional , with coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath40 . as it was observed in refs .",
    ", the dynamics of the langevin equation in the harmonic approximation can be diagonalized by rewritting it in coordinates @xmath41 and @xmath42 given by @xmath43 the constants @xmath44 are the eigenvalues that arise in the diagonalization .",
    "they satisfy @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the new set of coordinates , the equations of motion read @xmath47 these equations decouple in the harmonic approximation , i.e. , if @xmath48 , but they are still subject to the time - dependent stochastic driving force @xmath49 .",
    "this time dependence can be removed by the coordinate shift @xmath50 where @xmath51 , \\quad      s^\\ddag(t ) = -\\frac{1}{{\\lambda_\\text{u}}-{\\lambda_\\text{s}}}\\,s[{\\lambda_\\text{s } } , \\xi_\\alpha;t ] ,      \\ ] ] and the @xmath52 functionals  @xcite are given by @xmath53 = \\begin{cases }              \\displaystyle -\\int_t^\\infty g(\\tau)\\,\\exp(\\mu(t-\\tau ) ) \\,d\\tau \\!\\!\\ !                  & : \\ ; { \\operatorname{re}}\\mu>0 , \\\\[3ex ]              \\displaystyle + \\int_{-\\infty}^t g(\\tau)\\,\\exp(\\mu(t-\\tau ) ) \\,d\\tau \\!\\!\\ !                  & : \\ ; { \\operatorname{re}}\\mu<0 .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] the subscript @xmath54 is used in the @xmath52 functional to indicate the integration variable .",
    "this subscript will be left out whenever this does not cause any ambiguities . similarly , we have for the sake of simplicity not indicated in our notation that @xmath55 and @xmath56 depend on the realization @xmath12 of the noise , although they both obviously do .    the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 solve the equations of motion in the harmonic limit @xmath48 .",
    "they can therefore be regarded as the coordinates of a special trajectory called the ts  trajectory .",
    "this trajectory is distinguished from all other trajectories that are exposed to the same noise by the fact that it remains in the vicinity of the saddle point for all times , whereas a typical trajectory would descend into either the reactant or the product well both in the remote past and in the distant future .",
    "accordingly , when using coordinates @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we are describing a trajectory relative to the ts trajectory , which acts as a moving coordinate origin . in",
    "what follows , we will refer to @xmath57 and @xmath58 as relative coordinates and to the original @xmath41 and @xmath42 , or @xmath2 and @xmath7 as space fixed coordinates .",
    "the equations of motion in relative coordinates are    [ usdeltaeqnsorig ] @xmath59    at first sight , it appears that the time - dependent and stochastic shift   has removed both the time - dependence and the dependence of the realization @xmath12 of the noise .",
    "however , this is only true in the harmonic approximation . if we express the position coordinate @xmath2 in terms of the relative coordinates @xmath57 and @xmath58 as @xmath60 with @xmath61 , eq",
    ".   turns into    [ usdeltaeqnsgeneral ] @xmath62    the position @xmath63 of the ts  trajectory represents a time - dependent stochastic driving in these equations of motion .",
    "nevertheless , the coordinate shift has removed the stochastic driving from the leading - order terms in   and pushed it into the anharmonic perturbation .",
    "the description of the geometric phase space structure in the vicinity of the saddle point is most easily done if one starts from the harmonic limit .",
    "a full discussion can be found in refs .  .",
    "the equations of motion   decouple and become time independent when @xmath48 , and they can then be easily solved by writing @xmath64 since @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the coordinate @xmath57 grows exponentially in time , whereas @xmath58 shrinks .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 and @xmath58 correspond to unstable and stable directions in phase space , respectively . in particular , the lines @xmath67 and @xmath68 are invariant under the dynamics .",
    "a trajectory that starts on the line @xmath67 will asymptotically approach the origin as @xmath69 ; this line is called the stable manifold of the origin . a trajectory on the line @xmath68 will move away from the origin as @xmath69 , but it will approach the origin as @xmath70 ; this line is called the unstable manifold of the origin .",
    "+     the stable and unstable manifolds of the origin , together with several typical trajectories in relative coordinates , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf]a .",
    "the invariant manifolds separate trajectories with different qualitative behavior .",
    "trajectories above the stable manifold , i.e. , with larger relative velocity , move to the product side of the barrier for asymptotically long times , whereas trajectories below the stable manifold move to the reactant side .",
    "similarly , trajectories above the unstable manifold come from the reactant side in the distant past , whereas trajectories below the unstable manifold come from the product side .    for a reaction rate calculation",
    "we need to ascertain whether a trajectory will turn into reactants or products in the future . in our approach",
    "this sentence is rephrased into the condition : we need to decide whether a trajectory lies above or below the stable manifold .",
    "in other words , the stable manifold encodes the information about the reaction dynamics that is most relevant to us .",
    "we will therefore focus on the stable manifold in what follows , largely ignoring the unstable manifold .",
    "we can return to space fixed coordinates by undoing the time dependent shift  .",
    "after the shift , the stable and unstable manifolds are not attached to the origin of the coordinate system any more , but instead to the ts trajectory as a moving origin , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf](b ) . since",
    "the ts trajectory is time dependent , the manifolds will move through phase space with it .",
    "nevertheless , they still separate trajectories with different asymptotic behaviors . given a trajectory with a given initial condition at a certain time ,",
    "it can be classified as reactive or non - reactive by knowing the instantaneous position of the stable manifold at that time . through the ts trajectory ,",
    "that instantaneous position will depend on the realization of the noise .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : mf](b ) that at any time and for any realization of the noise the stable manifold intersects the axis @xmath71 at a point with a velocity @xmath72 . trajectories with initial positions @xmath71 and initial velocities @xmath73 are reactive , while trajectories with initial velocities @xmath74 are not .",
    "the critical velocity @xmath72 depends on time and on the realization of the noise . for the harmonic approximation ,",
    "it was shown in ref .  , and it will be rederived below , that @xmath75 since the critical velocity characterizes reactive trajectories , the transmission factor   can be expressed in terms of @xmath72 ( see ref .   and section  [ sec : rate ] below ) .",
    "this picture of the invariant manifolds was introduced in refs .   and applied to rate calculations in refs .  .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to explore how this picture changes when anharmonicities of the barrier potential are taken into account . in this case",
    "the equations of motion   are coupled in a nonlinear time - dependent way , and they can not be solved easily . however , as long as the coupling is sufficiently weak , it can be expected to find a ts trajectory and with its associated stable and unstable manifolds that are close to those in the harmonic approximation .",
    "indeed , there are general theorems in the theory of stochastic dynamical systems@xcite that guarantee the persistence of these structures . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf](c ) , the invariant manifolds in an anharmonic system will be tangent to their harmonic approximations at the ts trajectory , but they will not be straight lines anymore .",
    "because the coupling term in   is stochastically time dependent , the shapes of the invariant manifolds as well as their positions in phase space depend on time and on the realization of the noise .    the intersection of the stable manifold with the axis @xmath71 will give rise to a critical velocity @xmath72 such that trajectories with initial velocities larger than @xmath72 will be reactive , those with smaller initial velocities will not . the critical velocity can therefore be used in a rate calculation in an anharmonic system just as it can in the harmonic approximation , though its value will be different from  .",
    "a method to calculate the critical velocity will be developed in section  [ sec : perturb1d ] .",
    "in general it can not be guaranteed that there will only be a single intersection between the stable manifold and the axis @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , if the reaction potential has wells on the reactant and/or product side of the barrier , it is likely that there will be further intersections , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf](d ) .",
    "if a trajectory on the stable manifold is followed backwards in time , it will descend from the barrier , settling in one of the wells for some time .",
    "if it is followed for long enough , it will eventually cross the barrier again into the other well . in doing so , it must cross the line @xmath71 again , and thus give rise to additional intersections between the stable manifold and that line . however , as these additional intersections stem from previous barrier crossings , they must be neglected in the rate calculation . only for extremely strong nonlinearities",
    "additional intersections that are not separated by periods in which the trajectory was equilibrated in one of the wells will be found .",
    "we will neglect that possibility in what follows .",
    "instead , we will apply perturbation theory to calculate a value for the critical velocity that reduces to its harmonic approximation in the appropriate limit .",
    "the ts trajectory   solves the equations of motion   in the harmonic limit , but not in the presence of anharmonic coupling .",
    "strictly speaking , therefore , eq .   does not define a ts  trajectory on an anharmonic potential .",
    "such a trajectory could be obtained by a perturbative expansion similar to the one to be developed in section  [ sec : perturb1d ] . for our purposes , however , this will not be necessary .",
    "the harmonic ts  trajectory forms a suitable basis for the perturbation theory .",
    "we will therefore use the notation @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 exclusively to denote the harmonic approximation to the ts  trajectory .",
    "the critical velocity is defined by the intersection of the line @xmath71 with the stable manifold of the ts  trajectory .",
    "the stable manifold contains all those trajectories that approach the ts  trajectory as @xmath69 .",
    "they remain bounded for large times .",
    "solutions to the equations of motion   that satisfy this boundary condition at large time lie on the stable manifold .",
    "equation   can be formally solved in terms of the @xmath52  functional ( [ sdef ] ) as @xmath79.\\ ] ] notice that this is only a formal solution due to the presence of the unknown function @xmath57 in the r.h.s . of the equation .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath52  functional is undefined for most trajectories , only existing for the trajectories that remain bounded in the remote future .",
    "however , these are precisely the trajectories we are interested in . for consistency , we must then set @xmath80 , just as was done in refs .   in the construction of the ts  trajectory .",

    "nevertheless , it is clear that the perturbative expressions   and   describe the rate correctly .",
    "tst and related schemes have been widely used for rate calculations for a long time . for reactions that occur in solution ,",
    "recrossings of the ds pose a major difficulty in such calculations .",
    "many approaches try to overcome this problem by choosing the ds judiciously .",
    "by contrast , the method developed here is insensitive to the choice of this surface .",
    "the simplest choice of ds , which was taken here , also leads to the simplest calculation of the critical velocity .",
    "the use of a different ds would require a redefinition of the critical velocity to describe its intersection with the stable manifold , but this can be achieved with only minor modifications to the iteration procedure for the critical velocity .",
    "after that , any ds that lies within the barrier region would give the same rate .",
    "this independence of the ds is achieved by two crucial features of our method .",
    "first , the dynamics are described in phase space , rather than in configuration space , and modern geometric methods are used in our study .",
    "second , we focus on invariant geometric structures that are determined by the dynamics , rather than in structures , such as the ds , that are arbitrarily imposed by the researcher .",
    "the present results indicate that similar results apply to reactive systems that are coupled to their environments , i.e. , tst should focus on invariant structures in phase space .",
    "the focus of the present paper has been on analytic perturbation theory for the rate corrections on an anharmonic barrier .",
    "the different steps of this calculation have different levels of complexity . the critical velocity , which encodes the location of the invariant manifold , is very simple to calculate with the iteration scheme described here .",
    "moreover , it can easily be extended to higher orders .",
    "by contrast , the evaluation of the averages that yield the rate corrections is laborious . while straightforward in principle",
    ", it requires the calculation of a large number of exponential integrals something that , even for some of the results presented here , is only feasible with the help of a computer algebra system , _ _ mathematica__@xcite in our case .",
    "the crucial step that sets the current method apart from earlier algorithms is the calculation of the stable manifold and the critical velocity .",
    "it is encouraging , therefore , that this most important step of the calculation is also the easiest .",
    "this observation further suggests that to obtain an efficient algorithm to compute rates , the calculation of the stable manifold should be combined with numerical methods for the computation of averages . we will report on such combinations in a forthcoming publication",
