    "a promising avenue for new physics ( np ) to enter the observables of @xmath0-meson decays is given by @xmath3@xmath4 mixing . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the phenomenon of mixing originates from box topologies and is strongly suppressed . in the presence of np",
    ", new particles could give rise to additional box topologies or even contribute at the tree level .",
    "should these np contributions also involve new cp - violating phases , the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing phase @xmath2 could differ sizably from the tiny sm value of @xmath7 ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a key channel for addressing this exciting possibility is @xmath8 .",
    "a characteristic feature of this channel is that its final state contains two vector mesons and thereby requires a time - dependent angular analysis of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 decay products @xcite . over the last couple of years ,",
    "measurements at the tevatron of cp - violating asymmetries in  tagged \" analyses ( distinguishing between initially present @xmath3 or @xmath4 mesons ) of the @xmath8 channel indicate possible np effects in @xmath3@xmath4 mixing @xcite .",
    "these results are complemented by the measurement of the anomalous like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry at 0 , which was found to differ by @xmath11 from the sm prediction @xcite .",
    "this summer , the lhcb collaboration has also joined the arena , reporting , however , results that disfavour large np effects @xcite . the above measurements , which we will discuss in more detail below , are typically shown in the @xmath2@xmath1 plane , where @xmath1 is the width difference between the mass eigenstates of the @xmath0-meson system .    in this paper",
    ", we point out a new method for determining further constraints in the @xmath2@xmath1 plane using measurements of the effective lifetimes of @xmath0 decays .",
    "in particular , we show that the information provided by the lifetimes of a pair of decays into cp - even and cp - odd final states is sufficient to determine @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the advantage of this strategy is that it only requires an  untagged \" analysis , i.e.  it is not necessary to distinguish between initially present @xmath3 or @xmath4 mesons , which is experimentally advantageous .",
    "specifically , we will consider the @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite decays , which have final states with the cp eigenvalues @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . from here on we shall abbreviate the latter decay as @xmath14 .",
    "first measurements of the effective lifetimes of these channels are already available from the cdf and lhcb collaborations @xcite . for the theoretical interpretation of these results",
    "we also need to address hadronic uncertainties . a closer look will reveal that these decays are well suited in this respect . we will illustrate our method with the most recent data and shall compare the resulting constraints in the @xmath2@xmath1 plane with those from the alternative measurements listed above .    the outline is as follows : in section  [ sec : effective ] , we discuss the general formalism to calculate effective lifetimes and show in section  [ sec : cubic ] how the corresponding measurements can be converted into contours in the @xmath2@xmath1 plane . in section  [ sec :",
    "control ] , we turn to the hadronic uncertainties affecting this analysis and their control through experimental data . the constraints on the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing parameters arising from the current data for the effective lifetimes of the @xmath5 and @xmath14 channels are explored in section  [ sec : constraints ] , where we also illustrate the impact of future lifetime measurements with errors at the @xmath15 level .",
    "in section  [ sec : future ] , we give a collection of additional @xmath0 decays that can be added to this analysis in the future .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we will consider a @xmath16 transition with a final state @xmath17 into which both a @xmath3 and a @xmath4 meson can decay .",
    "the corresponding untagged rate can then be written as follows @xcite : @xmath18 where l and h denote the light and heavy @xmath0 mass eigenstates , respectively . using @xmath19",
    "we can straightforwardly write ( [ eqn : untagged ] ) as @xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath21    we define the effective lifetime of the decay @xmath22 as the time expectation value of the untagged rate @xcite , @xmath23 which is equivalent to the lifetime that results from fitting the two exponentials in to a single exponential @xcite .",
    "by making the usual definition @xmath24 we can express the effective lifetime as @xmath25y_s^2 + { \\cal o}(y_s^3 ) , \\label{eqn : tauexact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have also given the expansion in powers of @xmath26 up to cubic corrections .",
    "we proceed to consider the case where @xmath17 is a cp eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath27 . in the sm ,",
    "the decay amplitude can be written , without loss of generality ( using the unitarity of the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix ) , as @xmath28 where the @xmath29 are real and the @xmath30 and @xmath31 are cp - conserving strong and cp - violating weak phases , respectively . using the standard @xmath32@xmath33 mixing formalism @xcite , we have @xmath34 where @xmath35.\\ ] ] here we have introduced the abbreviation @xmath36 and @xmath2 denotes the @xmath32@xmath33 mixing phase , which is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the sm and np pieces , respectively .",
    "it is convenient for the following discussion to introduce the direct cp asymmetry of the @xmath40 decay @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 subsequently , we may write @xmath43 here @xmath44 is a hadronic phase shift , which is given by @xmath45 @xmath46 yielding @xmath47 the twofold ambiguity for @xmath44 arising from the latter expression can be resolved using sign information from @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "these expressions generalize those given in refs .  @xcite .    using ( [ eqn : adel ] ) and ( [ xi - simpl ] ) , we thus obtain @xmath50 as we will see in section  [ sec : control ]",
    ", there are fortunate @xmath0 decays into cp eigenstates where the hadronic parameter @xmath51 and the resulting phase shift @xmath44 can be controlled through experimental data . for these decays",
    ", we can hence use the corresponding lifetime measurements to constrain @xmath26 ( or @xmath1 ) with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "let us now have a closer look at , which we can write as the following cubic equation for the real parameter @xmath26 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 in order to solve this cubic equation , it is useful to rewrite it in the  reduced \" form @xmath54 with @xmath55 applying cardano s formula then yields the solutions @xmath56{r+\\sqrt{d } }       + e^{-i\\omega}\\ , \\sqrt[3]{r-\\sqrt{d}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 , where @xmath58 @xmath59    for @xmath60 , this solution is not valid as is then a quadratic equation in @xmath26 . furthermore , the above expressions may prove cumbersome to use in practice .",
    "a convenient approximate solution is obtained by solving the expansion in ( [ eqn : tauexact ] ) up to quadratic order in @xmath26 : @xmath61 \\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\left[\\frac{{\\cal a}^f_{\\delta\\gamma}}{2-({\\cal a}^f_{\\delta\\gamma})^2}\\right]^2 + \\frac{4}{\\tau_{b_s}}\\left[\\frac{\\tau_f - \\tau_{b_s}}{2-({\\cal a}^f_{\\delta\\gamma})^2}\\right]}.\\ ] ] this quadratic solution is in excellent agreement with the corresponding branches of the exact solution ( [ exact - sol ] ) for the numerical analyses discussed below .     given in for cp - even and cp - odd final states @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the decay amplitudes are assumed to have no cp - violating phases .",
    "we also show the constraint from the theoretical value of @xmath64 given in ( [ eqn : dggsm ] ) , as discussed in the text . ]    for illustration we consider two @xmath0 decays to cp eigenstates , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with positive and negative cp eigenvalues , respectively .",
    "further , we assume @xmath67 for these decays , yielding @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpillust ] , we show the lifetime constraints that are compatible with the theoretical sm calculation of @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath70 and the sm value of the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing phase , which is given as follows @xcite : @xmath71 throughout this paper , we shall use @xcite @xmath72 for the @xmath0 lifetime introduced in , resulting in the sm effective lifetimes @xmath73ps and @xmath74ps .",
    "the difference in behaviour for cp - odd and cp - even eigenstates is due to the non - linear dependence on @xmath26 in .",
    "said differently , if is expanded and only terms up to linear order in @xmath26 are kept the two curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpillust ] would overlap .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpillust ] , we have included another constraint , which is related to the theoretical value in ( [ eqn : dggsm ] ) as follows : if we assume that np can only affect @xmath1 through @xmath3@xmath4 mixing , which is a very plausible assumption , we have @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 here @xmath39 is the np @xmath3@xmath4 mixing phase , which also enters @xmath2 defined in ( [ phis ] ) on which @xmath77 depends , whereas the sm piece takes the following value @xcite : @xmath78    the formalism developed above is also valid for non - cp eigenstates provided the final state is accessible to both @xmath3 and @xmath4 so that mixing is possible .",
    "examples of such states are @xmath79 . for these decays the cp eigenvalue @xmath27 in should be replaced by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 denotes the relative orbital angular momentum of the decay products @xcite .",
    "examples of effective lifetimes that have been measured for @xmath0 decays to cp - even and cp - odd final states are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . unlike our hypothetical examples from the previous section , however , the decay amplitudes of these decays are not devoid of weak phases , and can be written in the sm as follows @xcite : @xmath84\\ ] ] @xmath85.\\ ] ] here @xmath86 is the wolfenstein parameter of the ckm matrix @xcite , @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the usual angle of the unitarity triangle whereas @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 are hadronic , cp - conserving parameters .",
    "consequently , the parameters introduced in and ( [ h - def ] ) take the forms @xmath93 and @xmath94 so that the hadronic phase shifts can be obtained from @xmath95\\sin\\gamma,\\ ] ] @xmath96\\sin\\gamma.\\ ] ] we observe that these phases are proportional to the tiny @xmath97 parameter , i.e.  are doubly cabibbo - suppressed .",
    "consequently , the @xmath98 observable given in ( [ eqn : adelcos ] ) is robust with respect to hadronic uncertainties for the decays at hand .    in the case of the @xmath5 channel",
    ", we can use the @xmath99-spin symmetry of strong interactions to relate it to the @xmath100 decay , which thereby allows us to determine @xmath88 as well as @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "the current status of an analysis along these lines , using also the direct cp violation in @xmath103 , is given by @xcite : @xmath104 where the errors include the uncertainties of the relevant input quantities and estimates of @xmath99-spin - breaking corrections .",
    "the @xmath88 result is in excellent agreement with the current fits of the unitarity triangle @xcite , thereby excluding large cp - violating np contributions to the @xmath5 decay amplitude . using these numbers in",
    ", we find @xmath105 where we have added the errors in quadrature .",
    "similarly , we also find @xmath106 .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is much more involved to control the hadronic effects in the @xmath14 decay through experimental data , and the potential control channel @xmath107 has not yet been observed . on the other hand ,",
    "contrary to @xmath82 , the denominator of ( [ tdelphi ] ) is equal to one at leading order in @xmath97 . following ref .",

    "<S> measurements of the effective lifetimes of @xmath0-meson decays , which only require untagged rate analyses , allow us to probe the width difference @xmath1 and the cp - violating phase @xmath2 of @xmath3@xmath4 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the dependence of the effective lifetime on non - linear terms in @xmath1 allows for a determination of @xmath2 and @xmath1 given a pair of @xmath0 decays into cp - even and cp - odd final states . using recent lifetime measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays , we illustrate this method and show how it complements the constraints in the @xmath2@xmath1 plane from other observables .    </S>",
