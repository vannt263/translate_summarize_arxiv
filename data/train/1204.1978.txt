    "using this observational result , @xcite showed that the summed contributions of dust in and outside galaxies appear to be in agreement with the total amount of dust ought to be produced in the universe .",
    "this implies that dust destruction does not play a major role in the global dust distribution and that most of the intergalactic dust survives over the cosmic time .    in this paper",

    "strong  absorbers , conventionally defined with a rest equivalent width @xmath7 , are associated with a range of galaxies with @xmath8 and are found at impact parameters ranging up to 100 kpc @xcite . while the physical mechanisms for the origin of these gas clouds are yet to be understood , most  absorbers seem to reside in galactic haloes .",
    "the use of absorbers offers an attractive property : the knowledge of the absorber incidence @xmath9 allows us to infer the cosmic mass density of dust contained in these systems without further assumptions on their spatial distribution .",
    "absorbers can hence be used to obtain a robust lower limit on the amount of baryons and dust residing outside galactic disks up to the halo radius , over the redshift range @xmath10 . in general , it is widely believed that absorbers do not host star forming regions and hence no source of dust grains .",
    "the presence of dust in these clouds would serve as an indicator to distinguish whether  absorbers predominantly are aggregates of pristine gas or are of secondary products from activities of nearby galaxies . characterizing and understanding its distribution is therefore an important task .",
    "the use of absorbers also allows us to infer the neutral hydrogen abundance in  clouds .",
    "these pieces of information concerning the ingredients of the clouds would lead us to infer properties of  absorbers , and then the nature and the formation of these systems . at the same time",

    "the extinction curve is not always monotonic , and the colour indices receive occasionally blueing for some wavelength ranges rather than reddening , with an amplitude of the order 0.01 magnitude .    choosing milky way type dust in our demonstration would increase the contribution from dust opacity by the relative @xmath48 ratio , i.e. by roughly a factor 8 . here , our choice of the smc type dust is motivated from the fact that it fits the extinction spectrum of  absorbers better , especially at short wavelengths @xmath49 , that is important to our consideration , and for the absence of the @xmath502175 feature @xcite .",

    "the overall agreement is good : the deviations from the theory curve are of the order of a few percent except for some specific case , which we discuss below .",
