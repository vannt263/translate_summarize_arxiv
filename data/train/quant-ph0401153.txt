    "this is the reason why the sample to sample variations of the optical tabulated data can not influence the value of the casimir force ( [ eq9 ] ) at separations @xmath69 nm .    in the separation region",
    "@xmath70 nm there are significant deviations depending on whether the casimir force ( [ eq9 ] ) is calculated using the optical tabulated data or by use of the plasma dielectric function ( [ eq12 ] ) .",

    "the scattering of electrons on phonons also contributes to the value of @xmath74 .",
    "however , the frequency of the electromagnetic field is so high that @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the debye temperature , so the frequency of the electron - phonon collisions is the same as it is at @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that of all the above processes , only the contribution of the electron - electron collisions to @xmath74 is frequency - dependent ( and increases as @xmath79 ) .",

    "<S> we compare theory and experiment in the casimir force measurement between gold surfaces performed with the atomic force microscope . </S>",
    "<S> both random and systematic experimental errors are found leading to a total absolute error equal to 8.5pn at 95% confidence . in terms of the relative errors , experimental precision of 1.75% is obtained at the shortest separation of 62 nm at 95% confidence level ( at 60% confidence the experimental precision of 1% is confirmed at the shortest separation ) . </S>",
    "<S> an independent determination of the accuracy of the theoretical calculations of the casimir force and its application to the experimental configuration is carefully made . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is paid to the sample - dependent variations of the optical tabulated data due to the presence of grains , contribution of surface plasmons , and errors introduced by the use of the proximity force theorem . </S>",
    "<S> nonmultiplicative and diffraction - type contributions to the surface roughness corrections are examined . </S>",
    "<S> the electric forces due to patch potentials resulting from the polycrystalline nature of the gold films are estimated . the finite size and thermal effects </S>",
    "<S> are found to be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical accuracy of about 1.69% and 1.1% are found at a separation 62 nm and 200 nm , respectively . within the limits of experimental and theoretical errors </S>",
    "<S> very good agreement between experiment and theory is confirmed characterized by the root mean square deviation of about 3.5pn within all measurement range . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion is made that the casimir force is stable relative to variations of the sample - dependent optical and electric properties , which opens new opportunities to use the casimir effect for diagnostic purposes . </S>"
