    "the possibility of a vortex glass phase in high-@xmath3 superconductors was proposed in 1989 by m. fisher and coworkers . @xcite throughout the years , two possible scenarios have been discussed : either there is a continuous phase transition from the vortex liquid to the vortex glass at a finite critical temperature,@xcite or there is a crossover temperature@xcite below which the vortex liquid freezes in a glassy regime . while early theoretical@xcite and experimental studies@xcite supported the existence of a finite temperature critical point , more recent theoretical arguments tend to favor the freezing scenario for the vortex liquid at a crossover temperature.@xcite experimentally , it is difficult to differentiate between a critical point and a strong crossover in near equilibrium measurements in superconductors with random pinning.@xcite the aim of this work is to show that the study of the _ nonequilibrium _ dynamics can help to clearly distinguish among these two scenarios . to this end , we will study nonequilibrium correlation and response functions in a model for the vortex glass transition that has a finite temperature critical point ( the unscreened gauge glass model)@xcite and compare with previous results in a model that has a crossover freezing transition to a glassy regime ( the interacting flux lines model).@xcite    the gauge glass ( gg ) model@xcite is a paradigmatic model for the vortex glass phase transition.@xcite it consists on the xy model with a random gauge potential vector .",
    "the gg is assumed to represent the physics of a superconductor with disorder at relatively high magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite it has been found that this model has a finite @xmath3 in three dimensions @xcite and several numerical works have studied its critical behavior , considering both equilibrium properties as well as dynamical and transport properties . @xcite early experiments",
    "@xcite on the scaling of current - voltage curves in high-@xmath3 superconductors obtained critical exponents @xmath4 and @xmath5 in reasonable agreement with the exponents obtained in simulations in the gg . however , in 1995 bokil and young@xcite showed that @xmath6 in three dimensions when magnetic screening in a finite length scale @xmath7 is included in the gg ( by adding fluctuations of the vector potential ) .",
    "@xcite later experiments also showed that the current - voltage curves do not scale as expected,@xcite while other experimental groups report good scaling with the gg exponents.@xcite since all superconductors have a finite screening length @xmath7 ( the london penetration depth ) , the findings of ref .",
    "discard the scenario of a finite temperature critical point .",
    "taking into account this result , zimanyi and coworkers@xcite considered a model of interacting flux lines ( ifl ) with finite interaction length @xmath7 and in the presence of quenched disorder.@xcite they found in this model that upon decreasing temperature the vortex - glass - like criticality is arrested at a crossover temperature signaling a freezing of flux lines .",
    "below this temperature the time scales grow very quickly with a dynamical behavior similar to what is found in structural ( `` window '' ) glasses.@xcite    this later result brings into attention the importance of the nonequilibrium behavior of vortex glasses as well as its possible relationship with the dynamical behavior of other glassy systems . in the recent years",
    ", there has been some progress in the general understanding of glasses through the study of their out - of - equilibrium dynamics.@xcite a characteristic of relaxing glassy systems is the loss of stationarity reflected by their _ aging _ properties , meaning that the dynamics of the system depends on the time elapsed after the preparation of the sample , @xmath8.@xcite as a consequence , dynamic correlation functions dependend on two times , the `` waiting time '' , @xmath8 , and the time @xmath9 elapsed during the measurement . also the linear response functions show aging effects , being dependent on @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and they are anomalous in the sense that they are not related to their associated correlation functions by the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "@xcite the standard protocol for the study of aging in glassy systems@xcite consists on preparing the sample at a high temperature ( @xmath10 ) and then to quench it to a final low temperature @xmath11 . at @xmath11 , two - time correlation functions @xmath12 and response functions @xmath13 are analyzed , where the measurement starts for @xmath14 . in several systems a simple aging law with @xmath15",
    "is typically found .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , a `` multiplicative '' aging law of the form @xmath16 has been found in polymers in random media @xcite and in systems that are quenched at the critical temperature , like ferromagnetic spin models@xcite and the ising sping glass.@xcite    in the case of vortices in superconductors with quenched disorder , bustingorry _ et al._@xcite have studied the nonequilibrium aging dynamics of the ifl model .",
    "they have found that it can be characterized by `` multiplicative aging '' , with a scaling form similar to what is found in polymers in random media.@xcite in order to compare with this result , we will study here the the aging and nonequilibrium dynamics of the gg model at the critical temperature , calculating two - times correlation and response functions .",
    "being at the critical point , a multiplicative aging law is expected , which in form should be similar to the type of aging observed numerically in the ifl.@xcite our aim is to compare the aging exponents of the gg at @xmath3 with the ones obtained for the ifl in ref .  . as we will show here",
    ", they turn out to be very different , a result that indicates that nonequilibrium aging experimental measurements could clearly distinguish among the two scenarios discussed in the first paragraph .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model hamiltonian and the simulation method . in section iii",
    "we define the observables to be calculated . in section",
    "iv we present our results for the correlation and response functions after a critical quench in the gg and we analyze their scaling with @xmath8 . finally in section",
    "v we discuss our results comparing with the disorder - free 3d xy model , the 3d isg and the ifl .",
    "the hamiltonian of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) gg model @xcite is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the superconducting phase at site @xmath19 , and we sum over nearest neighbors @xmath20 on a cubic lattice of linear size @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "the energy is normalized in units of @xmath26 , temperature in units of @xmath29 , and time scales are measured in number of monte carlo steps ( for full sweep for the @xmath30 sites ) .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium protocol used in this work , consists on a quench at time @xmath31 from a @xmath32 state to the critical temperature @xmath3 . for the 3d gg model ,",
    "the critical temperature is @xmath33 , according to ref .  .",
    "from this initial condition different two - times quantities are analyzed , which depend on both the waiting time @xmath8 , when the measurement begins , and a given time @xmath34 .",
    "for the monte carlo simulation local changes in the phases @xmath35 are accepted with probability given by the metropolis rate @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the inverse temperature and @xmath38 is the energy difference corresponding to the proposed phase change . in equilibrium simulations , the acceptance window for @xmath39",
    "is usually chosen less than @xmath40 and dependent on temperature in order to optimize the updating procedure . because we are interested in studying a nonequilibrium process , for local phase changes we will use the full @xmath40 acceptance angle window for the new phases @xmath39 , following the criterion used in ref .  .",
    "this is done in order to avoid the possibility that a limited acceptance angle might introduce an artificial temperature dependence in the relaxation .",
    "for simplicity , we will focus on the study of the two - times autocorrelation function defined as @xmath41}_{av } , \\label{correlation}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 indicates an average over different thermal histories ( different initial configurations and realizations of the thermal noise ) , and @xmath43_{av}$ ] represents a disorder average over different samples ( different realizations of @xmath23 ) . the corresponding two - times linear autoresponse function is @xmath44}_{av}. \\label{response}\\ ] ] in this case , the system is perturbed by applying an infinitesimal external field @xmath45 conjugated to @xmath46 .",

    "if we define the reduced integrated responses by @xmath52 then we can relate these functions to @xmath13 : @xcite @xmath53    if the perturbing field in each site , @xmath45 , is random and its two components are independently drawn from a bimodal distribution @xmath54 , both reduced integrated responses are given by @xcite @xmath55}_{av}. \\label{response2}\\ ] ]    in this work we show simulation results for systems of size @xmath56 at the temperature @xmath57 .",

    "abriet and karevski,@xcite have found @xmath131 , @xmath132 , which shows that in the disorder - free case the `` multiplicative '' scaling of aging is stronger ( i.e. , much larger values of @xmath133 and @xmath0 ) .",

    "@xcite as we can see , the aging exponents are slightly smaller in the 3d isg ( meaning a weaker multiplicative aging ) , but the values of @xmath2 are comparable within the statistical error with the gg",
    ". it has been argued in ref .   that @xmath2 is a novel universal quantity of non - equilibrium critical dynamics .",
    "it is interesting to observe that spin glass models like the isg and gg have similar values of @xmath2 .",
    "however , let us remind that most work on the _ equilibrium _ properties of the gg and the isg show evidence that they are in different universality classes.@xcite    as discussed in the introduction , two types of behaviors are predicted for the vortex glass transition : either a finite temperature critical point as described by the gg , or a crossover temperature as found in the ifl .",
    "the work of bokil and young@xcite discards the first scenario .",
    "however , from the experimental point of view , the issue is not clearly resolved since several experiments show reasonably good scaling at a transition temperature.@xcite comparing our results with the behavior found by bustingorry _",
    "et al._@xcite in the ifl , we believe that a study of the non - equilibrium dynamics of the vortex glass transition will be able to clearly distinguish between the two models . in simulations of the ifl , off - equilibrium correlation and response functions are found to scale as @xmath144 , and also it is found that @xmath145 for @xmath146.@xcite the first thing to notice when comparing with critical aging in the gg is that , in the ifl , the corresponding multiplicative aging exponent @xmath0 and the autocorrelation exponent @xmath147 coincide @xmath148 ( and similarly for the response exponents , @xmath149 ) .",
    "the second main difference is that the `` multiplicative '' aging in the ifl is very strong , @xmath150 when compared with the gg at the critical point , @xmath151 . in the ifl",
    "the competition between the elasticity of each flux line and the randomness of the pinning potential leads to a very slow dynamics and strong aging with a large @xmath152 exponent .",
    "moreover , @xmath152 depends with the disorder strength in the ifl , being larger for stronger disorder .    in this work",
    "we have analyzed the correlation and integrated response functions defined in eqs.([correlation ] ) and ( [ response2 ] ) , since they are easy to compute numerically . in experiments in superconductors ,",
    "correlation ( response ) functions of other observables like magnetization ( magnetic susceptibility ) and voltage ( resistance ) are , of course , more available . aging scaling similar to eqs.([co2 ] ) and ( [ re2 ] ) will also be expected in these other physical quantities .",
    "for example , one possible way of observing experimentally the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the vortex glass is monitoring the magnetic relaxation as done in ref . for granular samples .",
    "another possibility is to perform electrical transport experiments near the transition temperature following a protocol similar to the one used by ovadyahu and coworkers to study the electron glass regime in anderson insulators .",
    "@xcite in either case , an analysis of the multiplicative aging exponent will clearly distinguish among the two different models ( @xmath153 or @xmath151 ) .",
