    "in resent years ferromagnetic shape memory alloys have attracted considerable attention as a new class of actuator materials ( see , for a recent review , ref .  1 ) .",
    "among ferromagnetic shape memory alloys , the largest magnetic - field - induced strains arising from conversion of martensitic variants under action of a magnetic field  @xcite or caused by the shift of the martensitic transition temperature  @xcite have been observed in the most intensively studied ni@xmath1mnga alloy system .",
    "ni@xmath1mnga is a representative of mn - containing heusler alloys . for the stoichiometric composition a structural phase transition of martensitic type from the parent cubic to a complex tetragonally based structure occurs at @xmath4  k ,",
    "whereas long - range ferromagnetic ordering sets at @xmath5  k  @xcite .",
    "the martensitic transition temperature @xmath2 was found to be very sensitive to the composition , ranging from liquid helium temperature up to over 600  k  @xcite .",
    "contrary to @xmath2 , curie temperature @xmath3 of ni - mn - ga alloys is less composition dependent .",
    "based on the published experimental results  @xcite it can be concluded that the highest @xmath6  k is observed in the stoichiometric ni@xmath1mnga . a decrease of @xmath3 in the alloys with deficiency in mn , which possesses a magnetic moment of @xmath7 , is due to the dilution of the magnetic subsystem . for the alloys with mn",
    "excess , it was suggested that the decrease in @xmath3 is accounted for by antiferromagnetic coupling of the extra mn atoms  @xcite .",
    "analyzing data collected for a broad compositional range of ni - mn - ga alloys , chernenko  @xcite pointed out that there exists a correlation between the electron concentration and stability of high - temperature @xmath8-phase in the ni - mn - ga system .",
    "now it is generally acknowledged that a change of electron concentration @xmath9 significantly affects martensitic transition temperature @xmath2 of ni - mn - ga alloys , and , therefore , an empirical relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath9 can be reasonably used for the preparation of alloys with required martensitic transition temperature  @xcite . since large magnetic - field - induced strains are observed only in the ferromagnetic state , an efficient control of",
    "the ferromagnetic ordering temperature is of importance for realization of this effect in a large temperature interval and development of high temperature ferromagnetic shape memory alloys .",
    "since previous experimental studies  @xcite have shown that any deviation from the stoichiometry results in decrease of @xmath3 in ni - mn - ga alloys , we studied the influence of 3-@xmath0 ferromagnetic transition elements fe and co on curie temperature @xmath3 and martensitic transition temperature @xmath2 of ni - mn - ga .",
    "co- and fe - containing ni - mn - ga ingots of various compositions were prepared by arc - melting of high - purity initial elements in argon atmosphere .",
    "the ingots were annealed at 1100  k for 9  days in quartz ampoules and quenched in ice water .",
    "samples for the measurements were cut from the middle part of the ingots .",
    "the real compositions of the alloys were determined by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( icpms ) method .",
    "determination of the chemical compositions by icpms revealed that the real compositions of the alloys are close to the nominal ones .",
    "characteristic temperatures of the direct ( martensite start , @xmath10 and martensite finish , @xmath11 ) and the reverse ( austenite start , @xmath12 and austenite finish , @xmath13 ) martensitic transformations were determined from differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) measurements .",
    "the martensitic transition temperature @xmath2 was calculated as @xmath14 . a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm )",
    "was used for low - field magnetic measurements .",
    "curie temperature @xmath3 was determined as a minimum on the temperature derivative of magnetization curve measured upon heating , @xmath15 .",
    "nominal compositions of the alloys studied together with their martensitic and ferromagnetic transition temperatures are given in table  1 .",
    ".nominal composition , martensitic transition temperature @xmath2 and curie temperature @xmath3 of the alloys studied .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the nominal compositions of the alloys studied are ni@xmath16co@xmath17mn@xmath18ga ( @xmath19 = 0.03 , 0.06 and 0.09 ) and ni@xmath20mn@xmath21co@xmath22ga ( @xmath23 = 0.04 , 0.09 and 0.14 ) .",
    "it was found that the compositional dependencies of @xmath2 strongly depend on the co position .",
    "thus , the martensitic transition temperature @xmath2 of the ni@xmath16co@xmath17mn@xmath18ga alloys slightly decreases with the co excess , whereas in the ni@xmath20mn@xmath21co@xmath22ga alloys the increase in co content results in a significant increase of @xmath2 ( table  1 ) .",
    "a marked increase in the temperature of martensitic transition in the alloys where co is substituted for mn makes these materials attractive for use as high - temperature shape memory alloys .     for the ni@xmath20mn@xmath21co@xmath22ga alloys.,width=264 ]    the behavior of curie temperature @xmath3 in these two series of alloys also depends significantly on the position of co. in the ni@xmath16co@xmath17mn@xmath18ga alloys curie temperature increases from 348  k to 367  k with increasing co content from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( table  1 ) . contrary to this , @xmath3 in the ni@xmath20mn@xmath21co@xmath22ga alloys exhibits a non - monotonic dependence , and initially increases from @xmath26  k ( @xmath27 ) to @xmath28  k ( @xmath29 ) and then decreases to @xmath30  k for @xmath31 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 in the ni@xmath20mn@xmath32co@xmath33ga alloy exhibits hysteretic feature , as evidenced from @xmath34 measured upon heating and cooling ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "such an unusual behavior of ferromagnetic transition temperature is caused by the coupling of martensitic and ferromagnetic transition temperatures and has been observed in ni@xmath35mn@xmath36ga and ni@xmath37mn@xmath38ga alloys  @xcite .     measured upon heating and cooling for the ni@xmath20mn@xmath32co@xmath33ga alloy.,width=264 ]      in the fe - containing series of ni - mn - ga alloys fe",
    "was added instead of ni to the host ni@xmath39mn@xmath32ga composition .",
    "the nominal compositions of ni@xmath40fe@xmath41mn@xmath32ga alloys are characterized by the fe content @xmath42 = 0.04 , 0.08 , 0.12 and 0.16 .",
    "dsc measurements revealed that the martensitic transition temperature continuously decreases from @xmath43  k to @xmath44  k as fe content increases from @xmath45 to @xmath46 ( table  1 ) .",
    "the low - field magnetization measurements showed that curie temperature @xmath3 of the ni@xmath40fe@xmath41mn@xmath32ga alloys increases with the increase in fe content ( table  1 ) . in the sample with the highest fe content , ni@xmath47fe@xmath48mn@xmath32ga ,",
    "@xmath49  k is higher than that of the stoichiometric ni@xmath1mnga .",
    "it was suggested that the electron concentration plays an important role not only in stabilizing the heusler structure but that it is also a driving force for the structural phase transition in ni@xmath1mnga , which takes place when the contact between the fermi surface and brillouin zone boundary occurs  @xcite . the change in a number of valence electrons results in alteration of the density of states curve , which is a basis for the correlation the extent of phase stability and electron concentration @xmath9  @xcite .    our study of co- and fe - containing ni - mn - ga alloys revealed that increasing / decreasing in the number of conduction electron results in increase / decrease of the martensitic transformation temperature .",
    "data presented in fig .",
    "3 clearly demonstrate this tendency .",
    "resulting in decrease of the electron concentration @xmath9 , substitution of co for ni as well as fe for ni leads to the decrease of martensitic transition temperature . in the case of substitution of co for mn",
    ", the increase in the electron concentration brings to the increase of @xmath2 from 345  k for ni@xmath20mn@xmath32co@xmath33ga to 518  k for ni@xmath20mn@xmath50co@xmath51ga .",
    "this result is in agreement with an earlier experimental study of co - containing ni - mn - ga alloys  @xcite .     of the fe- and co - containing ni - mn - ga alloys as a function of electron concentration @xmath9.,width=264 ]    therefore , these results indicate that the approach used for the description of martensitic transition temperature as a function of electron concentration in ternary ni - mn - ga can also be applied for the case of quaternary heusler alloys . obviously , such an approach can be used only in a limited range of concentration of the forth element , where phase separation does not take place .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that new ferromagnetic shape memory alloys were found recently in ni - co - ga  @xcite and ni - fe - ga  @xcite systems , which formally can be considered as the case of complete substitution of mn for co and fe , respectively .",
    "magnetization measurements of two series of samples where ni was substituted by co or fe showed that curie temperature increases with increasing co ( or fe ) content ( table  1 ) .",
    "the most pronounced increase of @xmath3 is observed in the fe - containing alloys , where curie temperature increases from 347  k ( @xmath45 ) to 395  k ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "note that a considerable increase in @xmath3 was also observed in alloys where fe was added instead of mn , ni@xmath1mn@xmath52fe@xmath17ga  @xcite .",
    "the highest curie temperature , @xmath53  k , reported in those studies , was observed in the ni@xmath54mn@xmath55fe@xmath56ga@xmath57 composition .",
    "the mn content remains constant in the fe- and co - containing alloys ( mn content @xmath58 for the co - containing samples and mn content @xmath59 for the fe - containing samples ) and , therefore , the mn magnetic subsystem is supposed to be not influenced by these substitutions .",
    "the observed increase of @xmath3 in the co- and fe - containing samples implies that the magnetic properties of ni - mn - ga should be considered taking into account small magnetic moments located on ni atoms  @xcite and their coupling with magnetic moments of mn atoms .",
    "for example , the increase in @xmath3 in these alloys can be accounted for by a stronger co - mn ( fe - mn ) exchange interaction as compared to the ni - mn one . our experimental data , however , are not sufficient to make an unambiguous conclusion about the mechanism responsible for the increase of @xmath3 and therefore this effect needs further investigation .",
    "the experimentally observed increase of @xmath3 in ni@xmath16co@xmath17mn@xmath18ga and ni@xmath40fe@xmath41mn@xmath32ga is in accordance with a recent theoretical consideration of magnetic properties of ni@xmath1mnga and ni@xmath1mnal  @xcite . in ref .",
    "[ 25 ] a suggestion was made that ni significantly affects @xmath3 in these alloys and , therefore , curie temperature in ni@xmath1mnga could be increased by a substitution of the ni sites .",
    "note also that this suggestion is in accordance with empirical observation that curie temperature of co@xmath1mnz or cu@xmath1mnz ( z is a non - transition element ) alloys is higher than @xmath3 in corresponding ni@xmath1mnz alloys  @xcite .    in the ni@xmath20mn@xmath21co@xmath22ga alloys curie temperature @xmath3 exhibits a non - monotonous dependence as the co content increases ( fig .  1 )",
    "this is rather unusual , because in the mn - containing heusler alloys the dilution of the mn magnetic subsystem generally results in decrease of @xmath3 . in ni@xmath60mn@xmath52ga alloys , however , merging of @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "is accompanied by the increase of @xmath3 in a limited composition interval @xmath61  @xcite . by analogy with the ni@xmath60mn@xmath52ga alloys",
    "it could be suggested that the increase of @xmath3 from 352  k to 372  k as the co content changes from @xmath62 to @xmath29 is accounted for by the coupling of martensitic and ferromagnetic transitions , occurring in the ni@xmath20mn@xmath63co@xmath64ga alloy .",
    "this is not the case , as evident from the dsc measurements , which revealed that for this composition @xmath65  k is considerably higher than @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to look for another mechanism responsible for the non - monotonous compositional dependence of @xmath3 in the ni@xmath20mn@xmath21co@xmath22ga alloys .",
    "it is worth noting that similar behavior of @xmath3 has been observed in a fe@xmath1mn@xmath52v@xmath17si system , where curie temperature was found to increase from 219  k to 315  k with increasing @xmath19 from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , followed by a rapid decrease at a higher v content  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that this unusual behavior of the ferromagnetic ordering temperature in fe@xmath1mn@xmath52v@xmath17ga could be related to the band structure of the system  @xcite . in future",
    "it would be interesting to perform similar band calculation for the ni@xmath20mn@xmath21co@xmath22ga system .",
    "further experimental studies of ni@xmath20mn@xmath21co@xmath22ga alloys are also necessary in order to determine the critical co content at which curie temperature has a maximal value .",
    "in conclusion , our experimental results have revealed that in the studied fe- and co - containing ni - mn - ga alloys the behavior of the martensitic transition temperature can be satisfactory described as a function of the electron concentration @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic measurements have shown that addition of fe or co instead of ni results in increase of curie temperature @xmath3 . this observation together with the theoretical suggestion  @xcite gives a basic ground for the development of high temperature ferromagnetic shape memory alloys in the ni - mn - ga system ."
