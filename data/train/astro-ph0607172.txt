    "the past ten years have seen a number of increasingly successful attempts to detect and measure solar - like oscillations in other stars . due to its proximity and similarity to the sun , many of these studies",
    "have been focused on the star @xmath0 cen a. the first clear detection of p - mode oscillations on this star was made by @xcite from photometry using the wide - field infrared explorer ( wire ) satellite taken over a 50-day period .",
    "@xcite correctly determined the large frequency separation but , unfortunately , wrong @xmath1 identifications were made and hence an incorrect value for the small separation was determined .",
    "further detections and the first correct mode identifications were made by @xcite using a 13-day run of velocity measurements taken by the coralie spectrograph .",
    "more recently , @xcite determined the frequencies for over 40 individual modes from observations by the uves and ucles instruments taken over a period of 5 nights .",
    "the main driving force behind each subsequent study has been to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in order to initially detect as many modes as possible and then to better constrain the limits placed on the determined frequencies .",
    "it is of course also important to improve resolution , but practical constraints have meant all these studies were limited in the length of observations that could be made .",
    "this has meant accurate determination of mode parameters such as power , rotational splitting and lifetime has been difficult .    here , we apply two sophisticated fitting procedures to the wire @xmath0 cen a data collected in 1999 in order to improve the parameter determinations .",
    "although this data set has the poorest snr of the three studies mentioned above , it does have the longest time series .",
    "hence , we would expect to extract more reliable estimates of the average lifetime and rotational splitting of the @xmath0 cen a modes .",
    "the first fitting procedure we applied was a traditional power spectrum fitting method .",
    "this involved taking the fourier transform of the time series and then fitting a lorentzian - like model to the various mode peaks in the resulting power spectrum .",
    "the second procedure used is a new technique based on fitting the autocovariance function ( acf ) of the time series ( i.e. , the unnormalized autocorrelation function ) .",
    "since the modes seen in the acf are all superimposed , one must first filter the time series in order to isolate the modes one is hoping to fit .",
    "the acf can then be computed and a model based on an exponentially decaying , periodic function fitted to the result .",
    "this technique was first introduced as a possible method for mode determination by @xcite and developed more fully by @xcite in an attempt to better constrain mode parameters of long solar p - mode data sets .    in the initial investigation of the wire data by @xcite only a handful of modes",
    "were identified due to the poor snr in the data set . however",
    ", a distinct advantage of revisiting this data comes in having a large number of robust mode identifications from the aforementioned two later studies .",
    "this provides additional a - priori information that we can use as initial ` guess ' values for our fitting procedures .    in order to fully test our fitting of the wire data we also generated a set of artificial time series .",
    "these data were created specifically to mimic the wire data allowing us to explicitly determine the precision and robustness of our fitted parameters .",
    "we detail the creation of this simulated data in section  [ data_sec ] . in section  [ modelfit_sec ]",
    "we describe in detail the procedure involved in applying the two fitting techniques to the data .",
    "finally , in section  [ results_sec ] , we go on to present and analyse the results of our fitting for the mode frequencies , amplitudes , lifetimes and rotational splitting parameters .",
    "the wire satellite collected 50 days of photometry observations on the star @xmath0 cen a between july 15 and september 3 , 1999 .",
    "the orbit was 96 minutes , low earth and sun - synchronous , which unfortunately lead to rather significant pointing constraints .",
    "hence , observations could only be made for about 40 minutes out of each orbit .",
    "additionally there were some days when no data were collected and some days where data could not be used due to processing problems . hence , the resulting duty cycle for the wire time series was only 15% . the processing of the wire data to produce the final time series is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data were binned to a 10s cadence resulting in a series of 432,000 points .",
    "the processed time series is shown in fig  [ wire_timeseries ] , for both the full 50 days and a zoomed in section with just the first 8 days in order to show the main gap structure .",
    "being as the time series was made using photometry observations , the amplitudes are given in parts - per - million ( ppm ) .",
    "the method for converting between ppm and velocity is described in section  [ amps_sec ] .    a full set of simulated data made to resemble the wire time series was produced in order to test fitting on the real data .",
    "the laplace transform solution of the equation of a forced , damped harmonic oscillator was used in order to generate individual mode components of the artificial time series .",
    "the application of this model is described more fully in @xcite .",
    "a set of low-@xmath1 modes covering the ranges 0 @xmath4 2 and 1700 @xmath5 2650 @xmath2hz was created in this way .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath1 = 3 modes are not included since they do not appear to be detectable in the wire photometry data , although for more recent velocity observations they are @xcite . for each @xmath6 ,",
    "a rotationally induced splitting pattern was included , for which the visibilities , @xmath7 , of each component were fixed using the following equations ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 and the inclination , @xmath13 , was chosen as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a database of frequency and powers , based on preliminary fits to the wire data , was used in order to fix the various characteristics of each mode .",
    "where no modes could be identified , frequencies presented in @xcite were used .",
    "based on fits to the acf of the wire data ( see section  [ acf_sec ] ) we chose a constant rotational splitting of 0.5 @xmath2hz and a constant linewidth ( full width half maximum ) of 1.0 @xmath2hz ( equivalent to a lifetime or e - folding amplitude time of @xmath153.7 days ) .",
    "analysis of fits to these artificial data ( see sections 4.2 and 4.3 ) showed the parameters could be robustly determined .",
    "this gives confidence that the simulated spectra were a good match to , and a reliable cross check for , the real data .",
    "a background offset ( white noise ) was also added so as to match the wire data . in total 50 independent data sets",
    "were created , each of a length equal to the wire time series .",
    "the wire window function was imposed on each of them .",
    "in this section we outline the two different methods used to determine the various p mode parameters .",
    "first we discuss the more traditional power spectrum technique and then go onto introduce the acf method . in both cases",
    "we explain the specific models used to fit the wire data .      when fitting the power spectrum of a solar or solar - like p - mode time series the various mode components are generally modelled using either a lorentzian , or an asymmetric function that models small departures from a symmetric shape @xcite . for low-@xmath1 ( sun - as - a - star ) data this is commonly done by fitting individual mode pairs ( i.e. , @xmath1 = 0 with neighboring @xmath1 = 2 ; and @xmath1 = 1 with @xmath1 = 3 ) using narrow fitting ` windows ' centered on the target pair .",
    "unfortunately , certain characteristics of the wire data make this strategy difficult to implement .",
    "the rather severe window function mentioned in section  [ data_sec ] results in prominent sidebands at 173.6 @xmath2hz from the mode peaks . as a result the sidebands of modes lie in the vicinity of other overtones .",
    "this makes it very difficult to isolate a single mode pair and its sidebands without the presence of intervening modes .",
    "therefore , we adopt a strategy of fitting lorentzian profiles to all modes simultaneously .",
    "note that the wire power spectrum and the spectral window are shown in fig .",
    "[ powerspec ]    in the 1700 @xmath5 2650 @xmath2hz range a total of 27 modes were included in the simulated data sets : 9 each of @xmath1 = 0 , 1 and 2 .",
    "the @xmath1 = 1 and 2 modes were split into three and five components respectively to match the rotational splitting pattern .",
    "however , we chose to fit only the modes that are identifiable in the wire data , of which there are eighteen .",
    "for the power spectrum method , the power spectral density , @xmath16 , was modelled using a standard lorentzian profile for each peak summed over all visible modes and corresponding sidebands in the chosen frequency range , offset with a flat background , @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 where @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the height of each mode component ( i.e. , maximum power spectral density ) , @xmath21 is the central frequency of a mode , @xmath22 is the rotational splitting , w is the sideband spacing and @xmath23 is the width .    in the wire data , over the range 1700 @xmath5 2650 @xmath2hz",
    ", the radial overtone number , @xmath24 , increases from 14 to 23 .",
    "however , since we fit only 18 modes we do not sum over all the possible @xmath25 combinations .",
    "table 1 gives the list of @xmath24 and @xmath1-valued modes that are fitted .",
    "@xmath26 is the azimuthal order and is summed over @xmath27 , while @xmath28 is a dummy variable allowing us to include the first order sidebands in our model and as such is summed over @xmath29 .    .@xmath24 and @xmath1 values included in fitting . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the errors on the real data estimates given in tables  [ freqps ] and [ freqacf ] and on the artificial data estimates in fig .",
    "[ freqdiff ] show how the uncertainties vary quite substantially from one mode to the next .",
    "this is to be expected since the uncertainties depend strongly on the snr , when the snr is poor .",
    "the equation ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) : @xmath30 gives an estimate of the error on the fitted frequency , @xmath31 as a function of the linewidth , @xmath23 , the length of the time series , @xmath32 and the noise - to - signal ratio , @xmath33 ( i.e the inverse of the snr ) .",
    "when the snr is high , @xmath33 is small , and the level of uncertainty will be dominated by @xmath23 and @xmath32 and as such will remain fairly constant from mode to mode . however , for a poor snr , the @xmath33 term is important and so small changes in this , due to the difference in amplitudes of the modes , will have a large effect on the uncertainty .",
    "the relationship between the snr and the errors on the frequencies can be seen more clearly by plotting the standard deviation against the input amplitude of the modes , as in fig .",
    "[ freqerr - power ] ( this is equivalent to plotting against the signal - to - noise in amplitude since the background is kept constant with frequency ) .",
    "the large snr in the wire data also means that the typical uncertainties on our frequency estimates are somewhat larger than those given by @xcite , which were @xmath150.3 @xmath2hz",
    ".      there have to date been no successful attempts to measure the rotational splitting of the p - modes in @xmath0 cen a and thereby make a first step to constraining the internal rotation .",
    "however , by applying the acf fitting technique to the wire data and assuming a constant splitting across the frequency range we have been able to determine a reasonably well constrained estimate of 0.54 @xmath3 0.22 @xmath2hz .",
    "the simulated data were again used in order to check the accuracy of this estimate . by fitting the acf of the 50 artificial data sets an average splitting of 0.44 @xmath3 0.03 @xmath2hz was returned .",
    "this was within 2 standard errors of the input value of 0.5 @xmath2hz , indicating that the fits are relatively unbiased .",
    "it should be noted that of the 50 estimates returned via the acf method , 10 gave a splitting very close to zero .",
    "these ` null ' splitting results are a common problem when fitting poorly defined modes ( either due to poor resolution , low snr or a large width - to - splitting ratio ) , and we have taken the usual step of disregarding these values when determining the mean and standard deviation of the fits to the simulated data @xcite .    a value of the splitting was also returned when fitting the power spectrum .",
    "this method gave an estimate of 0.64 @xmath3 0.25 @xmath2hz , which is within errors of the estimate given by fitting the acf .",
    "however , fits to the simulated data showed a tendency for the estimates of the splitting to overestimate the true input value .",
    "an average of 0.68 @xmath3 0.03 was returned which gives a result which is @xmath156 standard errors too large .",
    "this is also a common problem in the solar case but is generally due to a large width - to - splitting ratio at high frequencies rather than a poor snr . because of the bias in the power spectrum estimate we would suggest that the value of the rotational splitting returned via fitting the acf is more robust .    a rotational splitting of 0.54 @xmath3 0.22 @xmath2hz gives a rotational period of 21@xmath34 days",
    "this agrees with a measurement of the @xmath0 cen a surface rotation rate determined by @xcite of 23@xmath35 days using chromospheric and transition region emission line features as markers of rotation .",
    "also , a surface rotation rate of 2700 @xmath3 700 ms@xmath36 from @xcite coupled with theoretical predictions of the alpha cen a radius of 1.23 r@xmath37 @xcite , give a prediction of 23 @xmath3 6 days .",
    "a similar correspondence of the low-@xmath1 splittings and the surface rate of rotation is seen for the sun .      since our model also assumed a fixed value for the linewidth we were able to obtain a well constrained estimate of this parameter .",
    "however we lose any knowledge of how the parameter varies with frequency .",
    "our estimate for the average linewidth of the modes from fitting the acf of the wire time series is 0.92 @xmath3 0.30 @xmath2hz , which equates to a lifetime of 3.9 @xmath3 1.4 days .",
    "fits to the acf of the simulated data gave an average width of 1.10 @xmath3 0.05 @xmath2hz , which is again within 2 standard errors of the input value of 1.0 @xmath2hz .",
    "our fits to the artificial data also showed a clear anti - correlation between the fitted linewidths and the fitted rotational splittings .",
    "this meant that the fits that returned ` null ' splittings also returned artificially high linewidths , as one might expect .",
    "we therefore removed these fits from our calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the artificial results , in the same manner as for the rotational splitting .",
    "our estimates of the linewidth from fitting the power spectrum gave us a much smaller value of 0.46 @xmath3 0.38 @xmath2hz , which is a lifetime of 8.1 @xmath3 6.8 days .",
    "however , fits to the simulated data showed estimates of the linewidth to be significantly underestimated .",
    "an average fitted value across the 50 data sets of 0.62 @xmath3 0.06 @xmath2hz was returned indicating an underestimate of over 6 standard errors .",
    "the same anti - correlation between linewidth and rotational splitting values that was seen when fitting the acf was also seen here with overestimates of the splitting being combined with underestimates in the linewidth .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the acf fitting technique also gives a more reliable estimate of the linewidth and hence lifetime of the @xmath0 cen a p - modes .    in relation to our assumption that fitting a constant width returns the average linewidth across the fitted modes we note that the acf fitting has also been tested on artificial data simulating solar oscillations , for which the linewidth varies with frequency .",
    "in this case we found that fitting a constant width did indeed return the input average across the modes .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite studies were both made from observations lasting just a few days ( 5 and 12 respectively ) and a direct measurement of the mode lifetime was difficult to achieve .",
    "however , @xcite were able to develop a method of estimating the lifetime from the scatter in the frequency measurements .",
    "their initial estimate put the average mode lifetime at @xmath38 days at 2.1 mhz , however , that has recently been reevaluated as @xmath39 days @xcite .",
    "this estimate is smaller than our value determined from fitting the acf of the wire data , although the error bars overlap .",
    "@cccc & & & +   + & & & + & & & + & & & + & & [ & + & & & + & & & + & [ & & + & & [ & + & & & + & & & + [ ampps ]    @ccccc & & & +   + & & & + & & & + & & & + & & & + & & & + & & & + & & & + & & & + & & & + & & & + [ ampacf ]    we have chosen to present the strength of the modes in terms of their amplitudes rather than power .",
    "we have also converted the units to velocity ( cms@xmath36 ) even though the wire observations were intensity measurements . in both cases",
    "this was done so as to more easily make comparisons with the @xcite study . to convert between intensity given in parts per million ( ppm ) and velocity we use the expression given in @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the amplitude of velocity oscillations in ms@xmath36 , @xmath42 the change in intensity at the effective wavelength @xmath43 ( @xmath15 450 nm for wire ) , @xmath44 the effective temperature of the star ( @xmath15 5770 for @xmath0 cen a ) and 5777k",
    "is taken as the effective temperature of the sun .",
    "of the four types of parameter examined in this paper the amplitudes are the least well constrained .",
    "this is because we have attempted to fit a separate power to each mode , rather than an average value across several modes as was done with the linewidth and splitting .",
    "this results in large uncertainties on the amplitude estimates as shown in tables  [ ampps ]  and  [ ampacf ] for the power spectrum and acf fitting respectively .",
    "indeed the errors on some of the weaker modes are larger than the actual estimated powers .",
    "hence , we can not put much credence in these values as they will be dominated by background noise .",
    "we have again used simulated data to test the accuracy of the fitted powers . in a similar fashion to that used for the fitted frequencies , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ powerdiff ] the difference between the power estimates averaged over the 50 artificial data sets and the input values .",
    "the plots show that both methods return a number of estimates that significantly underestimate the true input amplitude . in fig .",
    "[ powerdiff - power ] we plot the same data but as a function of the mode amplitude .",
    "this shows that when fitting the acf , the amplitude of the stronger modes seem to be underestimated by around 30 percent , whereas the weaker modes suffer less bias .",
    "this pattern is less obvious when fitting the power spectrum with little evidence of the bias being dependent on the strength of the modes .",
    "[ powerdiff ] , also shows a tendency for the power of the lower @xmath1-valued modes to underestimate the input values more so than for higher @xmath1-valued modes .",
    "this is particulary noticeable for the power spectrum fits .",
    "the 50-day time series of photometry observations taken in 1999 by the wire spacecraft has been reanalysed using power spectrum and autocovariance fitting methods . with the help of a - priori information , regarding the location in frequency of modes from other recent",
    "@xmath0 cen a studies , we have managed to fit 18 different modes in the power spectrum and autocovariance function ( acf ) , 16 of which were fitted in both .",
    "the values of the fitted frequencies are slightly lower than those determined by @xcite @xcite and @xcite @xcite , although without better data we can not say with any confidence whether this is indicative of an activity cycle for @xmath0 cen a.    in addition to the frequencies we have also been able to estimate an average rotational splitting across the fitted modes of 0.54 @xmath3 0.22 @xmath2hz using the acf .",
    "an average lifetime was also estimated by fitting the acf and was found to be 3.9 @xmath3 1.4 days . although the actual fitted value is larger than the lifetime estimated by @xcite , the error bars do overlap .",
    "estimates of the amplitude were also obtained , however they were rather poorly constrained , especially for the weaker modes .",
    "simulated time series made to mimic the wire data were created in order to test the accuracy and precision of the fitting methods using a monte carlo approach .",
    "we found that for the most part , the fitted parameter estimates averaged over a number of realizations agreed with the input values used to create the data .",
    "however , we did find that fits to the power spectrum tended to underestimate the linewidths and overestimate the splittings .",
    "the bias on both of these parameter estimates were reduced when fitting the acf .",
    "there still may be opportunities to refine this work further .",
    "for example , in this analysis , a fairly basic approach to dealing with the window function was employed , simply allowing for the subsequent sidebands in the models",
    ". a more sophisticated approach for fitting the power spectrum would be to convolve the spectral window with the model and fit that to the data .",
    "also , because of the weiner - khinchine relation , that states that the acf is actually the fourier transform of the power spectrum , this technique can probably be applied to the acf fitting approach as well .",
    "additionally , there is now a new set of wire @xmath0-cen observations that was taken in january 2004 and lasted for around 30 days .",
    "if modes can be identified and fitted from this data as well , it will give an excellent comparison with the 1999 time series and should allow for a better investigation into a possible activity cycle .",
    "we would like to thank all those who are , or have been , associated with the launching and operation of wire .",
    "we also thank the referee , t. bedding , for his careful review of the paper .",

    "consider a time series of length @xmath32 , of a stochastically excited p - mode with mean power @xmath16 and a lifetime @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting power spectrum peak can then be modelled according to a lorentzian function with a linewidth , @xmath46 . therefore , assuming the modal peak is well resolved in frequency , the maximum power spectral density per bin , @xmath20 , is given by : @xmath47 notice that @xmath23 is multiplied by @xmath32 in order to give the width in terms of the number of bins rather than hz .",
    "this expression can be rewritten in terms of the lifetime @xmath45 .",

    "therefore , a full description of @xmath20 in terms of the other parameters is @xcite : @xmath51 unfortunately , this does not give an adequate description for @xmath20 when @xmath52 . in order to do this we modify equation  [ heightpowtau ] slightly to give : @xmath53 which can be seen to work in both the over and undersampled regimes .    in order to test equation  [ heightpowmod ]",
    "we produced 1000 artificial time series of a single p - mode signal with linewidth of 1 @xmath2hz , ranging in length from 100 days down to 0.1 days .",

    "the figure shows clearly how the expressions given in equation  [ heightpowall ] diverge away from the true maximum power spectral density in the region @xmath54 , whereas equation  [ heightpowmod ] matches reasonably closely throughout the entire range .",
    "if one wishes to determine the power from the fitted linewidth , @xmath23 and the maximum power spectral density then equation  [ heightpowmod ] can be rearranged to give : @xmath55 which is the equation used in section  [ powspec_sec ] .",
