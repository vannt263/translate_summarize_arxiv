    "there have been many researches on quantum noise in light - emitting devices ( leds ) since the celebrated work of shawllow and townes @xcite .",
    "we here consider the quantum noise in semiconductor leds .",
    "this subject was first studied by haug and haken @xcite , who derived from a microscopic model useful formulae for the first and second optical coherence of leds .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid to sub - poissonian light ( spl ) , which has the intensity fluctuations lower than the standard quantum limit @xcite , of various leds @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for generation of spl in leds is quite different from that of squeezed light in nonlinear crystals @xcite .",
    "the latter mechanism is well understood as a bogoliuvov transformation of a coherent state into a squeezed state of light @xcite . the former mechanism , on the other hand , is often described by the langevin theory of laser @xcite .",
    "previous studies on spl in leds assumed that only a single mode or a few modes of photons are excited @xcite .",
    "when the injection level is lowered , however , many modes of photons become relevant , and we must consider all of them .",
    "simple theories for such a case were reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , they are too simplified so that they can not explain recent experiments by hirano , kuga ( hk ) and coworkers @xcite , who demonstrated that the experimental results at a low - injection level ( lil ) disagree with the predictions of the simplified theories .",
    "the disagreement appears when the quantum efficiency @xmath0 differs from the differential quantum efficiency @xmath1 .",
    "hk @xcite suggested that non - radiative processes might be responsible for the disagreement .    in this paper , to resolve the discrepancy between the previous theories and the experiments , we theoretically investigate the quantum noise in leds _ at a low - injection level _ @xcite .",
    "to this end , we extend the langevin - equation method of chow , koch and sargent @xcite to treat the case where many photon modes are excited in an led . from the microscopic quantum langevin equations ( qles ) and the associated noise correlations , we derive the semiconductor qles and the noise correlations at the lil .",
    "an important assumption is that the photon - absorption and emission rates are much smaller than the photon - escape rate from a `` cavity . '' in the experiment @xcite , it has been reported that @xmath4 in low - injection regions , whereas @xmath5 in high - injection regions . the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is , in our theory , attributed to non - radiative processes and carrier - number dependence of lifetimes .",
    "they always exist in real leds , and become particularly important in low - injection regions .",
    "in contrast , we can easily show that the previous simplified theories @xcite always give @xmath2 .",
    "hence our theory is a minimal one to simulate real leds .",
    "a new formula for the photon fano factor @xcite is derived .",
    "it gives the photon - number statistics as a function of the pump statistics , measuring frequency , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and some factors arising from _ multimodeness _ of leds .",
    "simplified formulae are derived for homogeneous cases , in which photons in each mode of the cavity are emitted and detected homogeneously , and for inhomogeneous cases , in which they are emitted and/or detected inhomogeneously . using these formulae",
    ", we discuss the condition for generation of spl in an led .",
    "our results agree with the experimental results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we derive the semiconductor qles and the noise correlations at the lil . in section 3 ,",
    "the semiconductor qles are used to derive a new formula for the photon fano factor . in section 4",
    ", we examine the formula in various cases , and compare our theory with recent experiments @xcite . in section 5 , we summarize the paper .",
    "chow _ et al_. @xcite discussed the case where a _ single mode _ is excited among many - photon modes of a cavity .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the photon statistics of leds at the lil , we extend their method to treat _ many modes _ of photons . the total hamiltonian @xmath6 ( which describes multimode photons in the cavity and carriers in the active layer of an led ) is written as @xmath7 ,   \\\\   { \\cal h}_{\\rm dipole }   & = &   \\sum_{l,\\bf k }   \\hbar ( g^{0}_{l,\\bf k } d^{\\dagger}_{-\\bf k } c^{\\dagger}_{\\bf k } a_l   +   { \\rm h.c . } ) , % \\\\ % \\label{def_of_g } % g^{0}_{l,\\bf k }   % & = & % -i \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\omega^0_{\\bf k } \\mu^0_{\\bf k})^2 } % { 2 \\hbar \\epsilon \\nu_l}}u_l({\\bf x}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of the multimode photons , @xmath9 is the annihilation operator for the photons in mode @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the field oscillation frequency in mode @xmath10 .",

    "the interaction among the carriers and the photons is represented by @xmath19 in the dipole approximation , with @xmath20 being the bare coupling constants , and h.c .",
    "means hermite conjugate .",
    "note that we here consider only a direct radiative transition , however , in real devices , there are other processes , and we will include them when necessary .",
    "the many - body interaction between the carriers is represented by @xmath21 , the hamiltonian of baths ( or environments ) by @xmath22 , and the interaction between the baths and the system ( the carriers and photons ) by @xmath23 .    to obtain qles , we start with making a mean - field approximation for @xmath21 , and consequently @xmath18 and @xmath24 are renormalized ( see , _",
