    "blueshifted fe k absorption lines have been detected in recent years between 7 and 10  kev in the x - ray spectra of several radio - quiet agns ( e.g. , chartas et al .",
    "2002 ; chartas et al .  2003 ; pounds et al .  2003 ; dadina et al .  2005 ; markowitz et al .",

    "2007 ; cappi et al .  2009",
    "; reeves et al .  2009 ) .",
    "these lines are commonly interpreted as due to resonant absorption from fe xxv  xxvi associated with a zone of circumnuclear gas photo - ionized by the central x - ray source , with ionization parameter log@xmath2@xmath135  erg  s@xmath3  cm and column density @xmath4@xmath1@xmath5@xmath6  @xmath7 .",
    "the energies of these absorption lines are systematically blueshifted and the corresponding velocities can reach up to mildly relativistic values of @xmath10.20.4c .",
    "these findings are important because they suggest the presence of previously unknown massive and highly ionized absorbing material outflowing from their nuclei , possibly connected with accretion disk winds / ejecta ( e.g. , king & pounds 2003 ; proga & kallman 2004 ; sim et al .",
    "2008 ; ohsuga et al .  2009 ; king 2010a ; sim et al .",
    "2010 ) or the base of a possible weak jet ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in particular , a uniform and systematic search for blueshifted fe k absorption lines in a large sample of 42 radio - quiet agns observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ has been performed in tombesi et al .",
    "( 2010a , hereafter ta ) . this study allowed us to assess their global detection significance and to overcome any possible publication bias . for clarity , there we defined ultra - fast outflows ( ufos ) those highly ionized absorbers detected essentially through fe xxv and fe xxvi k - shell absorption lines with blueshifted velocities v@xmath910,000  km / s ( @xmath10.03c ) .",
    "this was done to distinguish from the classical warm absorbers ( wa ) in agns , which are commonly detected in the soft x - ray band of more than half of radio - quiet objects .",
    "in fact , these absorbers are usually less ionized , are outflowing with velocities lower than @xmath11000  km / s and are supposed to have a different physical origin ( e.g. , blustin et al .",
    "2005 ; mckernan et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in ta we detected ufos in @xmath1035% of the sources , with outflow velocities even larger than 0.1c in @xmath125% of them , and observed also short time - scale variability of @xmath1days in a few cases",
    "however , in ta , the narrow absorption lines were modeled with simple inverted gaussians and the blueshifted velocities were estimated assuming a line identification essentially as fe xxv / xxvi 1s2p and 1s3p transitions . here",
    "we extend that work and model the fe k absorbers using the detailed photo - ionization code _ xstar _ v.  2.2 ( kallman & bautista 2001 ) , specifically developed for x - ray astronomy , which allows to derive a physically self - consistent estimate of the ionization parameter , column density and outflow velocity of the ufos .",
    "in addition , tombesi et al .",
    "( 2010b , hereafter",
    "tb ) also detected , for the first time , ufos in three out of five radio - loud agns observed by _",
    "suzaku_. these are in the form of a series of narrow absorption lines at energies greater than 7  kev . their likely interpretation as blueshifted fe xxv / xxvi k - shell resonance lines implies an origin from highly ionized gas outflowing with mildly relativistic velocities , in the range @xmath11@xmath120.040.15c .",
    "a fit with specific photo - ionization models give ionization parameters in the range log@xmath2@xmath1245.6  erg  s@xmath3  cm and column densities of @xmath4@xmath12@xmath5@xmath8  @xmath7 .",
    "their estimated location within @xmath10.010.3pc from the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) suggests a likely origin related to accretion disk winds / ejecta and maybe the jet present in these sources .",
    "depending on the absorber covering factor and geometry , the mass outflow rate of these ufos can be comparable to the accretion rate and their kinetic power can correspond to a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity and is comparable to the typical jet power of radio - loud sources .",
    "therefore , they might have the possibility to bring outward a significant amount of mass and energy , which can have an important influence on the surrounding environment ( e.g. , see review by cappi 2006 ) .",
    "in fact , feedback from the agn is expected to have a significant role in the evolution of the host galaxy , such as the enrichment of the ism or the reduction of star formation ( e.g. , see review by elvis 2006 and fabian 2009 ) . moreover",
    ", the ejection of a substantial amount of mass from the central regions of agns can also inhibit the growth of the smbhs and could also explain some fundamental relations ( e.g. , king 2010a , b , and references therein ) , potentially affecting their evolution .",
    "therefore , these ufos can play a significant role in the expected cosmological feedback from agns and can give us further clues on the relation between the accretion disk and the formation of winds / jets in both radio - quiet and radio - loud sources .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe a curve of growth analysis of the main fe xxv / xxvi k - shell absorption lines . in ",
    "3 we present the calculation of the average sed of the ta sample sources and the fits to the _ xmm - newton _ spectra with the photo - ionization code _ xstar_. in  4 we discuss the results of the fits and show the distribution of the ionization parameter , column density and outflow velocity of the ufos .",
    "the conclusions are reported in  5 . in appendix",
    "a we report the detailed photo - ionization modeling for each source and in appendix b the @xmath13 statistic and absorber redshift contour plots for each observation .",
    "we refer to a successive paper iii of this series ( tombesi et al . in prep . ) for a detailed discussion of the physical properties , geometry and energetics of the ufos here analyzed and also a comparison with the classical warm absorbers .",
    "due to the intense x - ray luminosity of the central source , absorbers in the inner regions of agns are mainly photo - ionized by this radiation instead of being locally ionized by thermal collisions ( e.g. , kinkhabwala et al .",
    "2002 ; crenshaw et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this way",
    ", they can reach very high levels of ionization maintaining relatively low and constant temperatures of @xmath14@xmath1@xmath15@xmath16  k ( e.g. , nicastro et al .  1999 ; bianchi et al .",
    "2005 ) . in order to properly parameterize the observed absorption features we need first to have a clear quantitative idea of the general dependence and effects of the different physical parameters of the photo - ionized plasma on the strength of the fe k absorption lines .",
    "these effects and dependencies have already been studied by bianchi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and risaliti et al .",
    "nevertheless , these authors were mainly interested in low velocity photo - ionized outflows in agns , instead of the ultra - fast outflows considered here , and used slightly different assumptions .",
    "however , the radiation processes are essentially the same in both cases and their results can be directly compared with ours .",
    "therefore , in this section we describe a detailed curve of growth analysis of the highly ionized fe k - shell absorption lines and then compare with what observed in the _ xmm - newton _ spectra of ta .",
    "we consider the most intense k - shell transitions of fe xxv and fe xxvi reported in table  1 .",
    "all line parameters throughout this paper have been taken from the nist atomic database , if not otherwise stated .",
    "the most prominent fe xxv lines are due to the he@xmath17 ( 1s@xmath181s2p ) and he@xmath19 ( 1s@xmath181s3p ) transitions , which further subdivide into inter - combination ( i ) and resonance lines ( r ) . at the moderate energy resolution of the _ xmm - newton _",
    "european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn instrument ( fwhm@xmath10150  ev at 6  kev ) these fine structure line components are not distinguishable and they are blended .",
    "therefore , we averaged their energies , weighted for the respective oscillator strengths .",
    "the consequent line energies are 6.697  kev for the fe xxv he@xmath17 and 7.880  kev for the fe xxv he@xmath19 , respectively , see table  1 .",
    "the most intense lines from fe xxvi are instead due to the lyman series , in particular the ly@xmath17 ( 1s2p ) and ly@xmath19 ( 1s3p ) , each of which further subdivide into two resonance doublets , r@xmath20 and r@xmath21 .",
    "their average energies , weighted for their oscillator strengths , are 6.966  kev for the fe xxvi ly@xmath17 and 8.250  kev for the fe xxvi ly@xmath19 , respectively , see table  1 .",
    "it should be noted that these strong lines are always accompanied by further less intense , higher order k - shell resonances , such as : fe xxv he@xmath22 ( 1s@xmath181s4p ) at e@xmath128.295  kev , fe xxv he@xmath23 ( 1s@xmath181s5p ) at e@xmath128.487  kev , fe xxvi ly@xmath22 ( 1s4p ) at e@xmath128.701  kev and fe xxvi ly@xmath23 ( 1s5p ) at e@xmath128.909  kev .",
    "however , their detection is hampered by the fact that they are intrinsically weaker than the former , with oscillator strengths @xmath245% and therefore with less intensity , and they are located at e@xmath08  kev where the s / n and energy resolution of the epic pn spectra are worse . therefore , here we do not present a curve of growth analysis of these weak lines but they are consistently taken into account when fitting the spectra using the _ xstar _ code ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "we performed a curve of growth analysis of the most intense fe xxv / xxvi k - shell absorption lines generated in a photo - ionized plasma .",
    "we used the line parameters reported in table  1 .",
    "this study allows us to derive a quantitative estimate of the dependence of the equivalent width ( ew ) of the lines , directly observable in the x - ray spectra , on the main physical parameters describing the absorbing material , such as the ionization parameter @xmath2 , the column density @xmath4 and the velocity broadening parameter @xmath25 .",
    "all calculations were performed separately for each line component listed in table  1 and only their final ews were summed .",
    "the relative abundances of fe xxv and fe xxvi ions are calculated by means of the photo - ionization code _",
    "xstar _ as a function of the ionization parameter and column density .",
    "we assume a power - law ionizing continuum with @xmath26@xmath272 , which is the typical value for seyfert galaxies in the x - rays ( e.g. , bianchi et al .",
    "2005 ; dadina 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "we use the standard definition of the ionization parameter @xmath28 , in units of erg  s@xmath3  cm ( tarter , tucker & salpeter 1969 ) , where @xmath29 is the ionizing luminosity between 1  ryd and 1000  ryd ( 1  ryd@xmath2713.6  ev ) , @xmath30 is the number density of the material and @xmath31 is the distance of the gas from the central source .",
    "this expression directly derives from the ionization balance equations and essentially represents the ratio between the density of the ionizing photons and the density of the absorbing material .",
    "we assume standard solar abundances and in particular an iron abundance relative to hydrogen of @xmath32 ( asplund et al .",
    "we assume a constant density of the gas , with the typical value used for the broad line region of type 1 agns , @xmath30@xmath27@xmath33  @xmath34 ( e.g. , crenshaw et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "we did not fix the gas temperature but let the code calculate the thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , the resultant temperatures are always consistent with the typical value of @xmath14@xmath1@xmath16  k ( e.g. , nicastro et al .  1999 ; bianchi et al .",
    "2005 ) . finally , we limited the treatment to a compton thin absorber , @xmath4@xmath35@xmath6  @xmath7 , distributed on a geometrically thin shell , @xmath36 .",
    "these assumptions are slightly different from those of bianchi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and risaliti et al .",
    "in particular , they derived the iron ions populations using a different photo - ionization code , cloudy ( ferland 2003 ) , but considered the same power - law continuum with @xmath26@xmath272 as in this work .",
    "they assumed a lower gas density of @xmath30@xmath27@xmath16  @xmath34 and fixed the gas temperature to @xmath14@xmath27@xmath16  k. they considered a slightly different iron abundance relative to hydrogen of @xmath37 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "they also used a different definition of the ionization parameter , @xmath38 , which however can be simply related to ours as log@xmath2@xmath124@xmath39log@xmath38 , for the @xmath26@xmath272 power - law continuum considered here .    to derive the ew of the absorption lines we followed an approach similar to that of nicastro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and bianchi et al .",
    "the ew of a resonant absorption line is defined as :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the dimensionless frequency specific optical depth of the considered transition :    @xmath42    in the above equation @xmath43 is the absorption coefficient at the frequency @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the number density of ions of the given element that populate the lower level of the transition considered , @xmath46 is the linear extension of the material along the line of sight , @xmath47 is the oscillator strength of the electron transition from the lower to the upper level and @xmath48 is the normalized voigt profile of the line .",
    "we then directly integrated the voigt profile , which can be written as ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the voigt function :    @xmath51    in which @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this is essentially a convolution of the gaussian and lorentzian line profiles . the gaussian profile , which represents the core of the line , depends on the doppler broadening @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the rest - frame specific frequency of the transition and @xmath25 is the velocity broadening parameter .",
    "the latter is the square root of the quadratic sum of the thermal velocity of the ions , @xmath56 , where @xmath14 is the gas temperature and @xmath57 the ion mass , and the gas turbulent velocity , or velocity dispersion along the line of sight , v@xmath58 : @xmath59 .",
    "the expected temperature of a highly ionized gas in photo - ionization equilibrium in the central regions of agns is of the order of @xmath14@xmath1@xmath16  k ( e.g. , bianchi et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) and the opacity is dominated by fe ions .",
    "we can estimate that the consequent thermal velocity of the gas is less than 20  km / s and therefore its contribution to the velocity broadening is negligible , less than 2% , for a typical value of the turbulent velocity of @xmath11000  km / s ( e.g. , nicastro et al .",
    "1999 ; bianchi et al .",
    "therefore , the velocity broadening parameter is dominated by the turbulence component and this fact is also strengthened by the linear dependence @xmath60  v@xmath58 , instead of @xmath61 .",
    "on the other hand , the lorentzian profile contributes to the broadening of the line wings and is a function of the natural broadening parameter @xmath22 , which in turn depends on the einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission for the transition considered , @xmath62 ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "the curve of growth of the fe xxv he@xmath17 and fe xxvi ly@xmath17 lines for a fixed ionization parameter log@xmath2@xmath273.5  erg  s@xmath3  cm are reported in the upper and lower panels of fig .  1 , respectively .",
    "for relatively low column densities , less than @xmath1@xmath5  @xmath7 , the curves follow a linear relation and the increase in ew is proportional to @xmath4 , ew @xmath63 . for larger columns , instead , saturation effects become more intense and the increase in ew is lower .",
    "however , here we can clearly see the effects of increasing the velocity broadening , from 20  km / s up to 10,000  km / s .",
    "the gaussian line core broadens and the column density needed to saturate the line is larger",
    ". therefore , the linear branch of the curve of growth spans over a larger range of @xmath4 before saturating and the lines can reach higher ews .",
    "in fact , we can see that for column densities of @xmath4@xmath1@xmath8@xmath6  @xmath7 the ew of both lines can reach values of @xmath110  ev for @xmath25@xmath1220  km / s and up to a few @xmath1100  ev for @xmath25@xmath1210,000  km / s .    as already noted before ,",
    "given that the temperature of the photo - ionized gas remains almost constant at the value of @xmath14@xmath1@xmath16  k ( e.g. , nicastro et al .  1999 ; bianchi et al .",
    "2005 ) , which corresponds to a thermal velocity of the fe ions lower than @xmath120  km / s , the broadening is essentially dominated by an increase in the turbulence component .",
    "we note that absorption lines with turbulent velocities as high as @xmath11000  km / s are shown by many broad - line agns ( e.g. , crenshaw et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) and such values are easily reached in gas moving close to smbhs ( e.g. nicastro et al .",
    "1999 ; bianchi et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "the dependence of the ew of the fe xxv he@xmath17 and fe xxvi ly@xmath17 absorption lines with respect to the ionization parameter is shown in fig .  2 for a set of given column densities and velocity broadening .",
    "the location of the peak of the distributions depends on the specific ionic population for different ionization states .",
    "in fact , the highest abundance for fe xxv is reached around log@xmath2@xmath123  erg  s@xmath3  cm .",
    "consequently , fe xxvi peaks at higher ionization levels of log@xmath2@xmath123.54  erg  s@xmath3  cm .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the ew distribution of fe xxv he@xmath17 is narrow , with a sharp rise and decline between log@xmath2@xmath12.54  erg  s@xmath3  cm . instead , that of fe xxvi ly@xmath17 is much broader , with a sharp rise at log@xmath2@xmath123  erg  s@xmath3  cm and a tail extending even up to log@xmath2@xmath126  erg  s@xmath3  cm .",
    "therefore , the fe xxvi transitions clearly dominate for ionization levels higher than log@xmath2@xmath124  erg  s@xmath3  cm .",
    "it is also important to note the rise of the ew following an increase of the velocity parameter , which is equivalent to say for higher turbulent velocities .",
    "in fact , increasing the velocity broadening @xmath25 from 100  km / s up to 5000  km / s , the resultant value at the peak can reach values from a few @xmath110  ev up to a few @xmath1100  ev for @xmath4@xmath1@xmath8@xmath6  @xmath7 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this , again , shows that the increase in turbulent velocity is an efficient mechanism to reduce the line saturation .",
    "3 shows the ratio between the ews of the fe xxv he@xmath17 and fe xxvi ly@xmath17 absorption lines as a function of the ionization parameter and for different column densities .",
    "we can note that for an ionization level of log@xmath2@xmath13.5  erg  s@xmath3  cm the ratio is @xmath11 and therefore we expect to observe both lines in the spectrum with comparable ews .",
    "instead , for lower or higher values of the ionization parameter the fe xxv he@xmath17 or the fe xxvi ly@xmath17 respectively dominate . in these cases",
    "we expect to observe essentially only one of these two strong lines .",
    "however , we can note that increasing the column density the ratio tends to approach unity for a wider range of ionization levels . in the limit of @xmath4@xmath1@xmath6  @xmath7",
    ", there is a plateau in the range log@xmath2@xmath134  erg  s@xmath3  cm in which the ratio is @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , also in this case we would expect to observe both lines in the x - ray spectrum with similar ews .",
    "this is again an effect due to the line saturation and it is less intense for higher velocity parameters .",
    "the ew ratios of fe xxv he@xmath17/he@xmath19 and fe xxvi ly@xmath17/ly@xmath19 for different column densities and velocity parameters are shown in the upper and lower panels of fig .  4 , respectively .",
    "the ionization level is fixed to log@xmath2@xmath273.5  erg  s@xmath3  cm for reference .",
    "we can note that for column densities lower than @xmath1@xmath64@xmath5  @xmath7 the ratios are essentially dictated by the ratios of the different oscillator strengths of the transitions , @xmath15 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "however , there is a tendency to approach unity for higher column densities .",
    "this effect is again due to the line saturation .",
    "in fact , for a fixed velocity broadening , the transitions with higher oscillator strengths , in this case he@xmath17 and ly@xmath17 , quickly reach high ews and therefore their cores saturate earlier than for the weaker lines , whose ews can instead still grow .",
    "it follows that for high column densities , @xmath4@xmath10@xmath5  @xmath7 , there is the possibility to observe both he@xmath17/he@xmath19 and ly@xmath17/ly@xmath19 absorption lines with comparable ews in the spectrum .",
    "this effect is however mitigated by an increase in the velocity broadening .",
    "as clearly shown in the upper and lower panels of fig .  4 , higher values of @xmath25 cause the decrease trend of the ratios to shift toward higher columns and the initial values are maintained for a wider range of @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we investigate the effects of changing different input parameters to the _ xstar _ code on the curve of growth of the fe k absorption lines .",
    "first , we checked the effects of assuming different continuum slopes .",
    "we find that changes of the power - law photon index in the wide range of values @xmath26@xmath271.52.5 provide ews which are always consistent within 10% .",
    "in particular , this essentially causes a slight shift of the peak of the ew distribution towards higher / lower ionization parameters for flat / steep slopes .",
    "this effect is mainly due to the fact that , given the same bolometric luminosity , in the flat / steep power - law cases we have more / less high energy photons at e@xmath06  kev that can effectively ionize iron atoms and produce fe xxv / xxvi absorption lines .",
    "therefore , to obtain the same iron ionic populations , steep spectra require slightly higher ionization levels than flat ones . from the definition of the ionization parameter , and assuming constant luminosity and density ,",
    "this can be translated into the need for the material to be closer to the x - ray radiation source for steep spectra in order to get more hard x - ray flux to increase the fe xxv / xxvi populations .",
    "we also tested that the inclusion of a possible uv - bump between @xmath11100  ev in the sed yields negligible effects to the fe k band based results . in fact , as already stated by mckernan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the presence or absence of the bump in the sed does not change significantly the parameters of the photo - ionized gas in the fe k band because the main driver here is again the ionizing continuum in the x - rays .",
    "we checked that the gas density does not play an important role in the overall modeling and the results are basically the same for a wide range of values , @xmath30@xmath1@xmath65@xmath66  @xmath34 ( e.g. , yaqoob et al .",
    "2003 ; bianchi et al .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that changing the density is equivalent to change the distance or luminosity , while leaving the same ionization parameter .    finally , it is important to note that , even using slightly different assumptions , our results showed in fig .  1 to fig .",
    "4 are quantitatively consistent overall with those showed in fig .  1 to fig .  6 of bianchi et al .  ( 2005 ) and fig .  4 of risaliti et al .  ( 2005 ) .",
    "the consistency of these independent studies means that the results do not drastically depend on the different assumptions and photo - ionization codes employed and this puts our final conclusions on a solid theoretical ground .",
    "in this section we describe the direct fit of the blueshifted fe k absorption features detected by us in ta at e@xmath06.4  kev in the spectra of the _ xmm - newton _ epic pn with the detailed photo - ionization code _",
    "xstar_. this allows us to derive estimates of the fundamental parameters of the absorbing material , such as the ionization level , column density and outflow velocity , in a physically self - consistent way .",
    "a good knowledge of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each source is important for the successive photo - ionization modeling of the fe k absorbers and is one of the main input quantities required by the _ xstar _ code .",
    "the shape of the sed in different energy bands depends on the emission processes which dominate the production of that radiation .",
    "as stated by elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , a single , nearly horizontal power - law is indeed a good phenomenological representation of the sed of typical agns , from the ir up to the x - rays .",
    "however , some deviations can be observed .",
    "for instance , the _ millimeter break _ , which is a drop in the power output in the sub - millimeter band compared to the optical . if the drop is @xmath12 orders of magnitude the sources are classified as radio - loud , instead if higher , even @xmath156 decades , they are labeled as radio - quiet .",
    "the latter are far more common , about @xmath1510 times more than the former ( e.g. , kellerman et al .",
    "1989 and references therein ) . in particular , the radio - loudness parameter defined as @xmath67 is usually used to formally differentiate between radio - loud and radio - quiet agns , where @xmath68 is the core 5 ghz radio flux and @xmath69 is the flux at 4400  , both in units of mjy ( e.g. , kellerman et al .",
    "1989 and references therein ) .",
    "this low energy emission is usually associated with the power - law synchrotron radiation from the relativistic radio jet .",
    "the _ uv bump _ ( or big blue bump ) is a rise of the optical - uv continuum above the ir .",
    "it is often interpreted in terms of thermal emission from the putative accretion disk . in particular , the beginning of the bump is marked by an inflection between 1 and 1.5 @xmath70 m , which is called the _ near - ir inflection point_. this is the only continuum feature which wavelength is well defined and it will be fundamental for the successive calculation of the average sed ( e.g. , elvis et al .  1994 ) .",
    "however , these `` low energy '' parts of the sed are almost negligible for our purposes of the photo - ionization modeling of highly ionized iron ions . instead , it is more important to have a good knowledge of the sed in the x - ray band , especially at e@xmath01  kev",
    ". the x - ray emission of radio - quiet agns is generally supposed to come from inverse compton of optical - uv seed disk photons in a hot corona .",
    "this component is well represented by a power - law continuum with typical photon index @xmath26@xmath122 , where @xmath71@xmath72@xmath73  ph  s@xmath3 @xmath7  kev@xmath3 , and exponential cut - off at e@xmath10100  kev ( e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1991 ; dadina 2008 and references therein ) .    as already stated , we need an estimate of the sed to calculate the _ xstar _ grid for the successive fitting of the fe k absorption lines .",
    "however , given the large number of sources ( 42 ) and observations ( 101 ) of the ta sample , it would be too much time consuming to calculate one for each case .",
    "moreover , the observed flux values at different energies have not been measured simultaneously and the seds should be corrected for possible intrinsic source variability . thus , there is the need to find a reasonable approximation of the typical phenomenological sed .",
    "we focus on the seds of the radio - quiet type 1 sources of our ta sample .",
    "this is due to the fact that possible obscuration and stellar contamination effects can prevent us from deriving a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic shape of the sed for the type 2s .",
    "we will make the reasonable assumption that their central engine is analogous to that in type 1s and that the overall shape of their intrinsic sed is essentially the same .",
    "this is consistent with the widely accepted unification model for agns which states that the main difference between the two classes is essentially due to a different observing angle with respect to the line of sight ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the type 1s also constitute the majority of the objects of our sample , 35 over 42 , and therefore they allow for better statistics .",
    "we derive the average sed of the radio - quiet type 1 sources as follows : 1 ) we downloaded the observed seds of the 35 type 1 agns from the ned database .",
    "these are composed by a collection of flux values measured from radio up to @xmath22-rays .",
    "2 ) we followed the approach of elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and normalized all the seds to the same arbitrary flux value at the near - ir inflection point at @xmath121.25 @xmath70 m ( e@xmath121  ev , see above ) .",
    "interestingly , the overall shape of the seds seems to be rather simple and is indeed similar for all the sources , see fig .",
    "5 ( black lines ) . then , 3 ) , we calculated the mean flux value for each energy and derived an average sed for each object .",
    "4 ) we averaged the flux values for each energy among all seds and derived a single average sed for all the sources . then , 5 ) , we interpolated the fluxes between consecutive energy points with power - laws . in doing so , we noted that the slopes were consistent one with each other for several wide energy intervals and this suggested to us the identification of three main energy bands .",
    "finally , 6 ) , we derived that essentially only four energy - flux points are required to properly describe the overall phenomenological sed and we calculated the power - law slopes among them .",
    "the values are reported in table  2 .",
    "the final average phenomenological sed can be simply divided in three main intervals : from radio to millimetric ( @xmath26@xmath12 ) , from millimetric to ir ( @xmath26@xmath10.1 ) and from ir to x - rays ( @xmath26@xmath12 ) .",
    "we remind the reader that the relation between the photon index ( @xmath26 ) and spectral index ( @xmath17 ) is @xmath74 . as shown in fig .  5 ( red line )",
    ", this indeed provides a good representation of the overall phenomenological sed of the type 1 agns .",
    "it is important to note that the value of @xmath26@xmath12 for the x - ray continuum , third interval in table  2 , is in agreement with the more detailed work of elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and with extensive broad - band x - ray spectral analyses ( e.g. , dadina 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , the mean phenomenological power - law slope in the e@xmath27410  kev band of the type 1 sources of ta is @xmath75@xmath26@xmath0@xmath11.8 .",
    "this is also expected from the two phase comptonization models , which describe the production mechanism of the x - ray radiation ( e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , and @xmath26@xmath12 is also usually assumed in photo - ionization studies of fe k absorbers in agns ( e.g. , bianchi et al .",
    "2005 ; cappi et al .",
    "2009 ; tb and references therein ) .",
    "we consider our previous paper ta as the starting point for the modeling of the fe k absorbers and we refer the reader to that for a detailed description of the data reduction , the continuum and emission lines modeling and the absorption lines detection significance . here",

    "however we checked that repeating the analysis considering a grouping of only 25 counts per bin and the use of the @xmath13 statistic , or alternatively not grouping the data at all and using the c - statistic ( cash 1979 ) , provide equivalent results . the detailed description of the fits for the observations of each source is reported in appendix a. the errors are reported at the 1@xmath76 level , if not otherwise stated .",

    "these values are reported in appendix a for each observation .",
    "the identification of spectral features in the fe k band is relatively secure since only k - shell lines of heavy ions are expected at e@xmath06  kev and those of iron are by far the most intense ( e.g. , kallman et al .",

    "there we explained the reasons supporting this choice , but postponed to this second paper for a conclusive test .    the possible contribution from lower ionization species of iron and the presence of ionized fe k edges should be taken into account .",
    "these edges have rest - frame energies in the range from e@xmath127.1  kev to e@xmath129.3  kev , depending on the ionization state of iron , from neutral to h - like ( e.g. , kallman et al .  2004 ) . as a sanity check , in ta we tested that the alternative modeling of the absorption lines with simple sharp absorption edges ( _ zedge _ in xspec ) did not significantly improve the spectral fits , as expected from the narrowness of the observed spectral features .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that the commonly held view of sharp fe k edges is an oversimplification of the real process and could lead to misleading results .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated that if the adequate treatment of the decay pathways of resonances converging to the k threshold is properly taken into account , the resulting edges are not sharp but smeared and broadened ( palmeri et al .",

    "this effect can be negligible for neutral or extremely ionized iron ( he / h - like ) but is quite relevant for intermediate states , with energies in the range e@xmath127.29  kev .",

    "for the case of 1h0419 - 577 we stepped the redshift starting from @xmath93 because the source cosmological redshift is @xmath94@xmath27@xmath95 .",

    "the @xmath13 of the fits plotted against the absorber redshift is reported for all observations in fig .  12 in appendix b. this is the best way to derive a physically self - consistent identification of the absorption features .",

    "then , if the possible alternative solutions had @xmath13 values consistent at the 90% level with respect to the best - fit , i.e. with a difference of @xmath97@xmath982.7 , we averaged the values of the parameters among them and derived the errors as half of the interval between the lowest and the highest possible values .",
    "this allows us to take into account both the statistical errors of measure and the uncertainty in the determination of the best - fit model or , equivalently , of the line identification .",
    "however , it is important to note that all the detected narrow fe k lines are indeed consistent with an identification as resonance transitions essentially from fe  xxv and fe  xxvi ions .",

    "the detailed treatment of the continuum modeling complexities , the background checks , the consistency check with the simultaneous _ xmm - newton _ epic metal oxide semi - conductor ( mos ) camera and the detection significance of the lines through the f - test and extensive monte carlo simulations were already reported in ta . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , fig .  7 and fig .  8 , here",
    "we note again that the background level of the observations of the sample in the 710  kev band is always less than @xmath110% of the source counts .",
    "we also checked that none of the reported blue - shifted absorption lines were induced by an erroneous subtraction of the epic pn instrumental background emission lines from ni k@xmath17 and cu k@xmath17 at the energies of 7.48  kev and 8.05  kev , respectively ( katayama et al .  2004 ) .",
    "in fact , only 4/22 of the absorption lines detected at e@xmath07  kev may have observed energies consistent at the 90% level with these and the features are present in the source spectra with and without background subtraction .",
    "moreover , the detected features can not be attributed to some sort of epic pn calibration artifact because they have been detected always at different energies and are narrow . instead , if due to instrumental calibration problems",
    ", they would have been expected to be present always at some specific energies or , if due to effective area calibration problems , to induce broad continuum distortions .    here , we perform additional tests to check the consistency of the photo - ionization modeling .",
    "we start with the sed .",
    "we checked that a different choice of the power - law slope in the wide range @xmath26@xmath271.52.5 has @xmath7510% effects on the @xmath4 and log@xmath2 estimates , within the measurement errors .",
    "this is consistent with what derived in  2.2 .",
    "we then compared the results using the average phenomenological sed derived in  3.1 with the power - law of @xmath26@xmath272 assumed in the curve of growth analysis of  2.2 .",
    "we reproduced the ew distributions reported in fig .  2 for these two cases and find a slight shift toward higher ionization parameters for the average sed to obtain the same value of the power - law sed at the peak .",
    "this effect is essentially due to the different high energy part of these two seds .",
    "in fact , the power - law and average seds have the same slope of @xmath26@xmath272 until e@xmath27@xmath15  ev , then the average sed drops to zero and the power - law one instead extends up to the upper limit of the _ xstar _ input energy band of e@xmath27@xmath16  ev .",
    "this means that , given the same bolometric luminosity , the average sed has slightly less high energy photons that can effectively ionize iron with respect to the power - law one .",
    "therefore , to obtain the same iron ionic populations , the average sed needs to increase the global ionization level of the material .",
    "however , the presence of the high energy cut - off at e@xmath12100  kev in the average sed causes only a negligible difference in the estimated ionization parameters in table  3 , being less than 5% and within the measurement errors .",
    "moreover , this high energy cut - off is naturally expected from comptonization models of the x - ray continuum in agns ( e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1991 and references therein ) and is in agreement with what is observed for local seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , dadina 2008 and references therein ) . moreover , as already noted by mckernan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the presence or absence of the possible uv - bump in the sed has a negligible effect on the parameters of the photo - ionized gas in the fe k band .",
    "again , this and the previous results are essentially due to the fact that only the high energy part of the x - ray continuum at e@xmath106  kev is capable of photoionizing the highly ionized absorbers studied here , which are dominated by fe xxv / xxvi .",
    "therefore , we can directly compare the _",
    "results in table  3 with the general trends reported in the curve of growth analysis of  2 .",
    "another important parameter of the _ xstar _ grids is the turbulent velocity of the plasma .",
    "it should be noted that the turbulent velocity considered in the grid is different from the velocity broadening parameter @xmath25 considered in the previous curve of growth analysis (  2.2 ) , which is the square root of the quadratic sum of the turbulent and thermal velocities .",
    "_ xstar _ already incorporates the thermal broadening of the lines .",
    "however , as already stated in  2.2 , the thermal velocity term for the highly ionized absorbers considered here is essentially negligible and the velocity broadening parameter @xmath25 is dominated by the turbulent component .",
    "therefore , for the highly ionized fe k features studied here and if not strongly affected by line blending , the velocity parameter @xmath25 defined in  2.2 , the turbulent velocity of the _ xstar _ grids @xmath116 and the velocity width of the lines @xmath77 measured from the spectra are all comparable .",
    "we tested that for lower / higher choices of this parameter , in the wide range @xmath11005000  km / s , the resultant estimate of the ionization parameter is essentially not affected , although the derived absorber column density is found to be slightly higher / lower .",
    "this is due to the line saturation effect , which changes the slope of the curve of growth for high column densities , see fig .  1 . to compensate for these possible systematics",
    ", we used an _",
    "grid with a turbulent velocity closest to the line velocity width , for the few cases in which the latter was constrained from the data .",
    "instead , for the other cases with only upper limits , we averaged the values of the parameters derived from fits using grids with different turbulent velocities , see  3.2 and appendix a.",
    "the summary of the best - fit parameters of our photo - ionization modeling of the fe k absorbers detected in the _ xmm - newton _ epic pn spectra of ta is reported in table  3 .",
    "we can see that the absorbers are systematically outflowing and their velocities are determined with high accuracy , with errors taking into account also the uncertainty on the line identification ( see   3.2 and appendix a ) .",
    "the velocity values are consistent overall with those derived in ta using inverted gaussians to model the absorption lines and a more simplistic line identification , see  4.1 and table  a.2 of ta .",
    "the observations in which we detected a ufo are marked with an asterisk in table  3 .",
    "the fraction of sources showing ufos with respect to the whole sample is again 15/42 , which corresponds to @xmath135% .",
    "however , as already discussed in  4.2 of ta , if we take into account the fact that we have only conservative estimates on the velocities and that there is a number of spectra in the sample with low s / n , the fraction of ufos is more probably in the range @xmath140%60% . the fraction of sources in the sample with ufos having velocities @xmath100.1c is @xmath111/42 ( @xmath125% ) .",
    "this frequency is instead @xmath111/15 ( @xmath170% ) only considering those with ufos .",
    "the fraction of sources showing ufos with respect to the total number with detected fe k absorbers is 15/19 ( @xmath180% ) .",
    "therefore , the great majority of sources with detected fe k absorbers show the presence of ufos .",
    "the number of observations with detected fe k absorption lines consistent with ufos is 19/28 ( @xmath170% ) , as reported in table  3 .",
    "the histograms representing the distribution of the outflow velocity , ionization and column density for the ufos and the lower velocity systems are shown in fig .",
    "9 , fig .  10 and fig .  11 , respectively .",
    "following the same considerations of ta , we averaged the values reported in table  3 among the observations of each source and considered the fractions with respect to the total number of sources in the sample ( 42 ) . instead , using each observation separately would have introduced a bias because the sources with more observations would have had a higher weight . from fig .",
    "9 we can see that the velocity distribution of ufos spans from @xmath110,000  km / s ( @xmath10.033c ) up to @xmath1100,000  km / s ( @xmath10.3c ) , and has a peak and mean value at @xmath142,000  km / s ( @xmath1 0.14c ) . instead , by definition , the distribution of the lower velocity systems is narrow and has a mean value of @xmath13,000  km / s ( @xmath10.01c ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the present data are affected by several selection effects that hampers the detection of absorption lines at higher energies , or equivalently , of absorbers with higher outflow velocities .",
    "an estimate of the magnitude of this effect was already reported in  4.2 and fig .",
    "this is due to a combination of different causes , such as : the upper limit of the epic pn detector bandwidth at @xmath110  kev , which does not allow the detection of fe k lines with blueshifts higher than @xmath10.30.4c for the local sources studied here , the drop in effective area and energy resolution of the instrument at e@xmath07  kev , the intrinsic lower number of counts for the power - law spectra at high energies and the relatively short exposures .",
    "we can derive an estimate of the influence of the limited s / n of the xmm - newton observations on the derived ufo velocity distribution normalizing the fraction of observations for each velocity interval in the histogram taking into account the number of observations that actually offer enough statistics to detect an absorption line at @xmath117 .",
    "as already discussed in  4.2 of ta , this number decreases rapidly for lines with lower ew and higher associated velocity .",
    "consequently , the allowed fraction of observations with higher velocity increases . assuming the typical absorption line ews of 2050",
    "ev , this implies that the peak and mean of the outflow velocity distribution of ufos in fig .",
    "9 can potentially shift from @xmath10.14c up to @xmath1 0.160.18c .",
    "as reported in table  3 , we have been able to measure the ionization parameter of the absorbers with good accuracy for all observations with fe k absorbers , taking also into account the uncertainty in the line identification .",
    "the distributions of the ionization parameter of the fe k absorbers ascribable to ufo and to the lower velocity systems are shown in fig .",
    "the values log@xmath2@xmath12.5 and 6 erg  s@xmath3  cm delimit the range in which fe  xxv / xxvi lines have observable ew@xmath1010  ev , consistently with fig .  2 .",
    "we can note that the ionization distribution for the ufos is much broader than for the other lower velocity absorbers , spanning the whole range from log@xmath2 of 2.5 up to 6 erg  s@xmath3  cm , with a mean value of log@xmath2@xmath14.2  erg  s@xmath3  cm .",
    "the very high log@xmath2 values of the ufos may possibly suggest that in some cases the material could not be detected in absorption due to the fact that even iron was completely ionized .",
    "instead , the lower velocity fe k absorbers are limited in the range log@xmath2@xmath12.54.5  erg  s@xmath3  cm , with a mean value of log@xmath2@xmath13.5  erg  s@xmath3  cm .",
    "11 shows the distribution of the column densities for the ufos and the lower velocity systems .",
    "we included only the best - fit values in table  3 for the cases in which the @xmath4 was constrained .",
    "we limited the treatment to compton - thin absorbers with @xmath4@xmath98@xmath6  @xmath7 .",
    "we can see that both distributions have column densities in the wide range @xmath4@xmath1@xmath5@xmath6  @xmath7 , with those of the ufos slightly higher than the lower velocity systems .",
    "their mean values are of @xmath4@xmath1@xmath118  @xmath7 and @xmath4@xmath1@xmath119  @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this might suggest the presence of possible compton thick material , at least in the inner regions of the flow .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the velocities and column densities of the fe k absorbers derived by fitting the x - ray spectra depend on the unknown inclination angle of the outflows with respect to our line of sight .",
    "in other words , they depend whether we are actually looking directly down the outflowing stream or if we intercept only part of it ( e.g. , elvis 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , these measures should be regarded only as conservative estimates and the intrinsic values might be higher .",
    "in this paper we performed an extension of the work presented by us in ta , in which we showed the detection of blueshifted fe k absorption lines ascribable to ufos in @xmath1035% of 42 local radio - quiet agns observed with _",
    "xmm - newton_. here , we started with a curve of growth analysis of the main fe xxv / xxvi k - shell transitions in photo - ionized plasmas .",
    "we studied the dependence of the equivalent width of the absorption lines as a function of the ionization parameter , column density , velocity broadening and the lines ratios .",
    "then , we estimated an average sed for the sample sources and directly modeled the fe k absorbers in the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic pn spectra with the photo - ionization code _ xstar_. a single absorption component is capable of self consistently parameterizing the simple gaussian absorption lines of ta for each observation .",
    "we derived the absorbers column density , ionization parameter and outflow velocity .",
    "the summary of the best - fit parameters is reported in table  3 .",
    "we confirm that the frequency of sources showing ufos in the radio - quiet sample is @xmath1035% and that the majority of the fe k absorbers are indeed associated with ufos ( @xmath1080% ) .",
    "we derived that the outflow velocity distribution of the ufos spans from @xmath110,000  km / s ( @xmath10.03c ) up to @xmath1100,000  km / s ( @xmath10.3c ) , with a peak and mean value at @xmath142,00055,000 km / s ( @xmath10.140.18c ) , taking into account also the presence of selection effects that hampers the detection of the higher velocity absorbers .",
    "these effects can only be reduced by performing much longer observations of these sources with the present instruments or using the higher sensitivity and energy resolution of the calorimeters on board the future astro - h and the proposed athena missions .",
    "the ionization parameter of the ufos is very high and in the wide range log@xmath2@xmath136  erg  s@xmath3  cm , consistent with fe  xxv / xxvi being the dominant lines , with a mean value of log@xmath2@xmath14.2  erg  s@xmath3  cm .",
    "this might give rise to the possibility of the presence of additional columns of material , which are unseen to absorption line spectroscopy because even iron is completely ionized .",
    "the column densities associated with the ufos are also large and in the broad range @xmath4@xmath1@xmath5@xmath6  @xmath7 , with a mean value of @xmath4@xmath1@xmath8  @xmath7 .",
    "this might suggest the presence of compton thick material , at least in the inner regions of the flow .",
    "however , besides possible selection effects , the measured velocities and column densities should also be regarded as conservative estimates because they depend on the unknown inclination angle of the flow with respect to the line of sight .",
    "depending on the actual outflow geometry and covering factor , the latter estimated from the detection frequency on the whole sample of @xmath10.40.6 in  5 of ta , this material might be observed also in emission , through fluorescence / recombination lines , continuum reflection , bremsstrahlung and/or black body emission .",
    "the electron temperature of kt@xmath1100  ev ( see  2.2 ) then suggests the continuum emission might be mainly in the soft x - rays ( e.g. , king & pounds 2003 ; pounds & reeves 2007 ; sim et al .",
    "2008 ; sim et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) . finally , it is important to note that the parameters here derived for the ufos in the local radio - quiet agn sample of ta in table  3 are consistent overall with those estimated for the complementary , but much smaller , local radio - loud agn sample in tb , suggesting a possible link between the two agn classes .",
    "we refer to a successive paper iii of this series ( tombesi et al .  in prep .",
    ") for a detailed discussion of the physical properties , geometry and energetics of the ufos here analyzed and also a comparison with the classical agn warm absorbers .",
    "finally , significant improvements are expected from the high effective area and supreme energy resolution in the fe k band offered by the x - ray microcalorimeters on board the future astro - h and the proposed athena missions .",
