    "the location of the spiral arms in our galaxy and their influence on the kinematics of gas and young stars is undoubtedly of great importance for understanding the large - scale hydrodynamic processes and the evolution of stellar groupings and that of the galaxy as a whole . only in our own galaxy",
    "it is possible to derive the space velocity field of young stars and analyze the radial and azimuthal velocity components simultaneously .",
    "however , even now the location of spiral arms in the galaxy remains a subject of discussion .",
    "there are two main approaches to the problem .",
    "the first one consists in identifying spiral arms from regions of enhanced density of young objects in the galactic disk ( morgan _ et al . _",
    "1952 ; fenkart and binggeli 1979 ; humphreys 1979 ; efremov 7198 ; berdnikov and chernin 1999 , and others ) .",
    "the main idea of the second approach is to look for telltale kinematical signatures of spiral arms ( burton 1971 ; burton and bania 1974 ; creze and mennessier 1973 ; gerasimenko 1993 ; mishurov _ et al .",
    "_ 1979 , 1997 ; melnik _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , 1999 ; sitnik and melnik 1999 ; sitnik _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 , and others ) .",
    "we consider the latter approach to be more promising , because kinematical analyses can be performed on incomplete samples , whereas when comparing stellar space densities in different regions of the galaxy , it is necessary to allow for observational selection , which is a very difficult problem .",
    "however , when performing kinematical analyses , one is up against another problem .",
    "almost all stars with known line - of - sight velocities and proper motions are located within 3 kpc of the sun , with the kinematical data becoming extremely scarce at greater heliocentric distances . as a result",
    ", it is impossible to infer the pitch angle of spiral arms directly from observations , because such a determination would require kinematic data for a solar neighborhood comparable in size with the distance to the galactic center .",
    "the basic idea of our approach to analyzing the velocity field is to determine the wavelength @xmath6 of periodic velocity variations along the galactic radius - vector ignoring the nonzero spiral - arm pitch angle and assuming spiral - arm fragments to have the shapes of circular segments .",
    "the wavelength in question is to a first approximation equal to the interarm distance .",
    "we first applied this technique to the cepheid velocity field and found @xmath7 kpc ( melnik _ et al .",
    "it is this parameter and not the spiral - arm pitch angle that we determine directly from an analysis of stellar kinematics . to estimate the pitch angle",
    ", we must also know the number or arms @xmath8 .",
    "we can then determine the mean pitch angle @xmath9 of spiral arms in terms of a model of regular spiral pattern using the simple relation @xmath10 of the density wave theory ( lin _ et al .",
    "the number of spiral arms is very difficult to establish even from radio observations , because no reliable distance estimates are usually available for gas clouds and other spiral - arm indicators observed at radio frequencies at large heliocentric distances .",
    "for a two - armed spiral pattern a wavelength of @xmath11 kpc corresponds to a mean pitch angle of @xmath12 .    in the density - wave theory",
    "there is a fixed phase shift of @xmath13 between the oscillations of radial and azimuthal components of velocity perturbations for tightly wound arms ( lin _ et al . _ 1969 ) .",
    "however , simulations of the kinematics of spiral arms with allowance for gas - dynamic effects ( roberts 1969 ) showed both components to exhibit maximum variations at the shock front .",
    "therefore , one would expect that the oscillations of the radial and azimuthal components of residual velocity must be synchronized , and their phases should not be shifted relative to each other .",
    "the allowance for shock effects , even in a coarse approximation , requires an independent determination of the phases of oscillations of the radial and azimuthal components of residual velocity .",
    "it is the dropping of the requirement of the fixed phase shift between the oscillations of the two components that allowed considerable perturbations in the azimuthal residual velocities to be found in the @xmath3 region .",
    "unfortunately , our method allows us to determine the arm location only up to @xmath14 , i.e. , up to shifting arms into the interarm space .",
    "moreover , it is impossible to choose between the two solutions for the location of the spiral pattern based on kinematical data alone . for the final choice",
    ", we invoke the additional information about the location of starburst regions with respect to the periodic pattern found in the velocity field studied .",
    "this information allows us not only to choose the right spiral - pattern solution , but also to determine the position of the region considered ( within 3 kpc from the sun ) with respect to the corotation radius .",
    "it is impossible to analyze the spiral pattern of our galaxy without the knowledge of reliable distances to the objects studied .",
    "the use of ob associations instead of individual stars allows , due to averaging , a more reliable distance scale to be constructed and more reliable velocities to be derived .",
    "ob associations are sparse groupings of young stars ( ambartsumyan 1949 ) .",
    "a comparison of virial mass estimates of ob - associations with the masses estimated by modeling their stellar content suggests that these groupings are gravitationally unbound . presently , there are several partitions of galactic ob - stars into associations , those of blaha and humphreys ( 1989 ) , garmany and stencel ( 1992 ) , and melnik and efremov ( 1995 ) .",
    "all these partitions are based on the catalog of luminous stars of blaha and humphreys ( 1980 ) .",
    "however , garmany and stencel ( 1992 ) identified their ob - associations only in the @xmath15 region .",
    "melnik and efremov ( 1995 ) used cluster analysis technique to identify the densest and most compact groups , the cores of ob - associations . however , these groupings contain twice as few stars than the associations of blaha and humphreys and , moreover , in dense regions , kinematical data are available for a smaller fraction of stars .",
    "we therefore consider the partition of ob - stars into associations suggested by blaha and humphreys ( 1989 ) to be more suitable for kinematical analyses .",
    "the sky - plane sizes of most of the ob - associations of blaha and humpreys ( 1989 ) do not exceed 300 pc ( except cep ob1 and ngc 2430 ) , and the use of these objects for identifying periodic patterns with typical scale lengths greater than 1 kpc is a quite correct procedure .",
    "the inclusion of a list ob - stars in the hipparcos ( 1997 ) program allowed their space motions to be analyzed for the first time ( de zeeuw _ et al._1999 ) .",
    "to construct the velocity field of ob associations , we used the following data :    1 .   the catalog of stars in ob associations by blaha and humphreys ( 1989 ) and heliocentric distances @xmath16 of these associations ; 2 .",
    "the catalog of classical cepheids ( berdnikov 1987 ; berdnikov _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) with distances on the so - called short distance scale ( berdnikov and efremov 1985 ) ; 3 .",
    "the solar galactocentric distance @xmath17 kpc ( rastorguev _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; dambis _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; glushkova _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) ; 4 .",
    "the short distance scale for ob associations , @xmath18 , which is consistent with the short distance scale for cepheids ( sitnik and melnik 1996 ; dambis _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) ; 5 .   stellar line - of sight velocities from the catalog by barbier - brossat and figon ( 2000 ) ; 6 .",
    "proper motions of stars adopted from the hipparcos ( 1997 ) catalog .",
    "the distances to ob associations that we use here and the solar galactocentric distance were obtained on the same distance scale , which agrees with the short distance scale for cepheids .",
    "the catalog of blaha and humphreys ( 1989 ) includes a number of extended open clusters , such as collinder 121 and trumpler 16 , because it is very difficult to distinguish unambiguously between ob - associations and young clusters .",
    "however , we did not use in our analysis other young clusters that were not included in the catalog of blaha and humphreys ( 1989 ) , because of a considerable overlap between the lists of ob - association and young - cluster stars with known kinematical parameters ( glushkova 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "we determined median line - of - sight velocities for a total of 70 ob associations containing at least two stars with known line - of - sight velocities , and median tangential velocities , for 62 associations containing at least two stars with known proper motions.anna/page3.html ] the velocity of each ob association is based , on the average , on 12 line - of - sight velocities and 11 proper motions of individual stars .",
    "we excluded the distant association ara ob1b ( @xmath19 kpc ) from our sample because of its large @xmath20 velocity component , which exceeds 20 km s@xmath2 .",
    "in the case of tightly wound spiral arms , the velocity field must exhibit variations of the value and direction of residual stellar velocities ( i.e. , velocities corrected for the solar apex motion and galactic rotation ) on galactocentric distance .",
    "we now write the expressions for the perturbation of radial @xmath21 and azimuthal @xmath22 components of residual velocities in the form of periodic functions of the logarithm of galactocentric distance @xmath23 :    @xmath24    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the amplitudes of variations of velocity components @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "parameter @xmath6 ( in kpc ) characterizes the wavelength of the periodic velocity variations along the galactic radius - vector .",
    "the angels @xmath28 and @xmath29 determine the phases of oscillations at the solar galactocentric distance . assuming that galactic arms have the shape of logarithmic spirals",
    ", we adopted a logarithmic dependence of the wave phase on galactocentric distance , which degenerates into a linear function @xmath30 if @xmath31 is small .    to demonstrate that the periodic pattern in the field of residual velocities is independent of the adopted model of circular rotation",
    ", we found the parameters of the periodic pattern jointly with those of differential circular galactic rotation and the components of solar velocity .",
    "we inferred all these quantities from a joint solution of bottlinger equations ( kulikovski 1985 ) for line - of - sight velocities @xmath32 and velocity components @xmath33 ( @xmath34 [ km s@xmath2 kpc@xmath2 ( arcsec yr@xmath35 @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the proper - motion component along the galactic longitude ) with allowance for perturbations induced by the density wave :    @xmath38    @xmath39    here , @xmath40 is the azimuthal galactocentric angle between the directions toward the star and the sun ; @xmath41 is the angular velocity of galactic rotation at the solar galactocentric distance ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the first and second derivatives with respect to galactocentric distance taken at a distance of @xmath44 ; @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are the solar velocity components relative to the centroid of ob - associations in the directions of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 axes , respectively .",
    "the @xmath48-axis is directed away from the galactic center , the @xmath49-axis is in the direction of galactic rotation , and the @xmath50-axis points toward the north galactic pole .",
    "velocity components @xmath45 and @xmath46 include the solar - velocity perturbation due to the spiral density wave .",
    "( in galactic astronomy the @xmath48-axis is traditionally directed toward the galactic center and one should therefore compare @xmath51 and not @xmath45 with the standard solar apex ) .",
    "we adopted @xmath52 km s@xmath2 for the solar velocity component along the @xmath50-coordinate ( kulikovski , 1985 ; rastorguev _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .    to linearize equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) with respect to the oscillation phases @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we rewrite the formulas for perturbations of velocity components @xmath21 and @xmath22 as follows :    @xmath53    @xmath54    the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 can then be found from the relations :    @xmath55    @xmath56    we computed the weight factors @xmath57 in the equations for @xmath32 and @xmath33 as follows :    @xmath58    @xmath59    here @xmath60 is the dispersion of residual velocities of ob associations with respect to the adopted model of motion ( without allowance for the triaxial shape of the velocity distribution ) ; @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the standard errors of measured stellar line - of - sight velocities and proper motions , respectively .",
    "we determined the dispersion using iterations technique , which yielded @xmath63 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we then applied the least - squares technique to find a joint solution of the system of equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , which are linear with respect to the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , with weight factors ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) and fixed @xmath6 ( see p. 499",
