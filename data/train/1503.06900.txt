    "let @xmath481 be the set of @xmath337-regular vns and @xmath482 the set of @xmath325 regular cns .",
    "interest is in the case where the expansion in the previous definitions is for sets of vns and @xmath483 and its boundary is a subset of the cns @xmath482 and bounds on the resulting expansion coefficients is in terms of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix .",
    "this case was included in the interesting recent work @xcite and several results from that work will be of interest here . that work defined the @xmath459-biregular bipartite graph @xmath418 to be ramanujan if @xmath484 a natural extension of the regular graph case by setting @xmath485 , although not theoretically justified .    for coding applications ,",
    "the parity check matrix @xmath88 is often the @xmath37 matrix derived from a combinatorial configuration or finite geometry , where the @xmath4 rows of @xmath88 are identified with the blocks of the configuration or lines of the geometry and the columns of @xmath88 with the points .",
    "it can be described as the line - point adjacency matrix of the structure .",
    "the work of @xcite refers to this matrix as the _ transfer matrix_.    in terms of this matrix @xmath88 , the adjacency matrix of the configuration or geometry which is @xmath472 , a point - point adjacency matrix , ( and not using the blocks as graph vertices ) is easily seen to be @xmath486 where there are @xmath487 lines intersecting a point and @xmath113 is a @xmath472 identity matrix .    the related adjacency matrix @xmath360 which includes both the left vertices of the tanner graph ( vns of the code ) and the right vertices ( cns of the code ) , is of the form @xmath488    this is the matrix and graph whose expansion properties are of interest .",
    "of course in the case of a @xmath459-biregular bipartite graph , the rows of the @xmath37 matrix @xmath88 have weight @xmath325 and columns have weight @xmath337 .",
    "note that @xmath489    as discussed in @xcite , the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of graphs of partial geometries are well known .",
    "such combinatorial structures correspond to two class association schemes and strongly regular graphs and the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graphs of the pag@xmath490 @xmath491 of ( [ eq : srg ] ) are given by : @xmath492    it is clear @xcite that the eigenvalues of @xmath493 are those of the matrix @xmath491 of ( [ eq : srg ] ) , with @xmath9 added to each eigenvalue , and with the same multiplicities , i.e. , the eigenvalues of @xmath493 are @xmath128 , @xmath494 and @xmath39 .    it is noted in @xcite that if @xmath495 is an eigenvector of @xmath496 with eigenvalue @xmath497 then @xmath498 is an eigenvector of @xmath499 with the same eigenvalue .",
    "thus @xmath496 and @xmath114 have the same eigenvalues ( with different multiplicities ) .",
    "it is not difficult to show that if the eigenvalues of the matrix of interest @xmath360 in ( [ eq : tanner ] ) are @xmath500 , then the eigenvalues of @xmath496 are @xmath501 and the expansion properties of the graph are determined by the `` second '' eigenvalue @xmath502 .",
    "as @xmath360 is a real symmetric matrix we have the rank of @xmath360 , @xmath503 , is equal to the rank of @xmath504 and from ( [ eq : tanner ] ) , @xmath505 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath504 are those of @xmath496 which are the same ( in magnitude , not necessarily in multiplicity ) as those of @xmath114 .",
    "thus , arguing in the reverse from the previous paragraph , the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath360 of ( [ eq : tanner ] ) are @xmath506 , @xmath507 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus the second eigenvalue is @xmath508 .",
    "the expansion coefficient of any @xmath459-biregular bipartite graph is given by @xcite @xmath509 and the importance of the magnitude of the second eigenvalue is seen , i.e. , the smaller the size of @xmath502 the larger the expansion of the graph .",
    "such information is used in @xcite and @xcite to determine bounds on the minimum distance of the codes with parity - check matrix @xmath88 .",
    "the interest here is in the expansion properties of the code with parity - check matrix @xmath88 .",
    "since the second eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath360 is @xmath508 , this suggests that the graphs of partial geometries with @xmath11 as large as possible , while still being partial geometries , will have the best expansion properties , i.e. , @xmath22 corresponding to nets . notice that the two classes of partial geometries constructed in this paper are two classes of nets . for the first class , @xmath510 and @xmath511 , and for the second class , @xmath512 and @xmath513 .",
    "hence , they have good expansion properties . while the parameters of the partial geometry , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are not independent , the conclusion is interesting and worthy of further consideration .",
    "for interest , to conclude this section , the ratio of @xmath514 is compared for biregular bipartite graphs and @xmath139-regular graphs . from the discussion , for @xmath139-regular graphs , for the ramanujan case",
    ", @xmath515 while for @xmath516-biregular bipartite graphs from partial geometries the ratio is @xmath517 if parameters can be chosen so that @xmath518 and @xmath11 small , the two ratios are similar . for larger values of @xmath11 , however , such as for nets , the ratio of the eigenvalues of the partial geometry is approximately @xmath519 , suggesting graphs with large @xmath10 and @xmath11 would have better expansion .",
    "several aspects of codes derived from partial geometries have been considered .",
    "new results on codes from partial geometries were given , including an interesting characterization of them in terms of arrays of cyclic permutation matrices and two new and simple constructions .",
    "the trapping sets of codes from partial geometries were also investigated using the geometric properties of their constructions . finally , comments were given on the expansion properties of graphs from partial geometries .",
