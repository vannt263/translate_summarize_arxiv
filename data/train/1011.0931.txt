    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm , for recent reviews see @xcite ) provides an elegant solution to the @xmath5-problem of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite : after the replacement of the @xmath5-term in the superpotential of the mssm by the coupling to a gauge singlet superfield @xmath6 , the superpotential is scale invariant and the only dimensionful parameters in the lagrangian are soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , all components of the gauge singlet superfield @xmath6 mix with the components of the mssm - like higgs doublet superfields @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "accordingly nmssm specific phenomena can take place in the cp - even higgs sector , the cp - odd higgs sector and the neutralino sector . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the neutralino sector , where the 5th singlet - like neutralino ( in addition to the two neutral higgsinos , the neutral wino and the bino ) can be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) @xcite and , simultanously , give rise to a dark matter density in agreement with wmap constraints @xcite .",
    "such a scenario is not far fetched : a conceptually simple origin of soft susy breaking terms is a minimal coupling to supergravity ( with a flavour independent khler potential and minimal gauge kinetic terms ) , and the assumption of spontaneously broken susy in a hidden sector .",
    "then , the soft susy breaking terms are universal at the planck scale ( not far from the gut scale ) in the form of universal scalar masses @xmath9 , universal gaugino masses @xmath10 and universal trilinear scalar couplings proportional to @xmath11 .    the correspondingly constrained nmssm ( cnmssm ) has been studied first in @xcite .",
    "since then , the precision of the radiative corrections has been considerably improved , and the computation of the dark matter relic density has become possible @xcite .",
    "imposing the requirement of a dark matter relic density in agreement with wmap constraints @xcite as well as present constraints on higgs and supersymmetric particle ( sparticle ) masses , the parameter space of the cnmssm has been analysed recently in @xcite .",
    "( for studies of the semi - constrained nmssm , where the singlet - dependent susy breaking parameters are allowed to be non - universal , see @xcite . )    within the cnmssm , the dark matter constraints require a singlino - like lsp .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is quite easy to understand : first , the cp - even scalar singlet @xmath12 has to assume a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) in order to generate the required @xmath5-term . for this reason",
    "its susy breaking mass squared @xmath13 at the electroweak scale must not be very large ; otherwise the minimum of its potential is at @xmath14 .",
    "second , @xmath13 is hardly renormalized between the gut and the electroweak scales , which leads to @xmath15 with the consequence that , in the cnmssm , @xmath9 must be small compared to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    it is well known that , within the cmssm @xcite , a small value of @xmath9 would imply a stau ( @xmath16 ) lsp , which is not a reasonable candidate for the dark matter . in the cnmssm ,",
    "the singlino - like neutralino @xmath17 can  and must  be lighter than the @xmath16 for this reason . in order for its dark matter relic density not being too large , its mass must be only a few gev below the mass of the @xmath16 such that @xmath18 coannihilation processes are sufficiently fast @xcite .    such a scenario would necessarily have a strong impact on sparticle searches at colliders ( see  @xcite for reviews of searches at the lhc ) : since the @xmath16 is the nlsp and the singlino - like neutralino @xmath17 couples only very weakly to all sparticles , the sparticles decay first into the @xmath16 under the emission of at least one @xmath0-lepton .",
    "subsequently the @xmath16 decays into @xmath19 , hence each sparticle decay cascade contains typically two @xmath0-leptons . in the present paper we study , for the first time , the corresponding implications for sparticle searches at the lhc .    as discussed in @xcite , the sparticle ( and higgs ) spectrum",
    "is quite constrained in the cnmssm , and can essentially be parametrized by @xmath10 .",
    "the present lower bounds on @xmath20 and the lower lep bound of @xmath21  gev on the cp - even standard model like higgs mass require @xmath22  gev which , inspite of @xmath9 @xmath23  gev , implies a quite heavy sparticle spectrum : squark masses @xmath2  tev ( apart from the somewhat lighter stop and sbottom masses ) , and a gluino mass @xmath1  tev . since consequently squark production will be relatively frequent compared to gluino production ( in fact , squark + gluino production dominates )",
    ", the signal events will mostly lead to two jets ( not counting isr and fsr ) with a quite large @xmath24 as well as a large missing transverse energy .",
    "the sum of the squark and/or gluino production cross sections is , however , just @xmath25  pb or less ( for larger @xmath10 ) .",
    "each sparticle production event in the cnmssm will contain typically four @xmath0-leptons in the final state : two of the @xmath0-leptons ( those originating from @xmath16 decays into @xmath19 ) will be quite soft due to the small @xmath26 mass difference @xmath27  gev and are difficult to detect , whereas the @xmath0-leptons from decays as @xmath28 are relatively energetic .    the aim of the present paper is to show that a dedicated analysis allows for much better signal to background ratios for the cnmssm than standard ( generic ) supersymmetric analyses .",
    "we simulate and study signals and various standard model backgrounds for the lhc at 14  tev c.m .",
    "energy , and find that the signal to background ratio is sufficiently large allowing for the discovery of the cnmssm for a wide range of values of @xmath10 .",
    "events with , jets and @xmath0-leptons could also be a signal for the ( c)mssm in the so - called stau - coannihilation region @xcite .",
    "since the squark / neutralino spectrum of the cmssm is necessarily different from the cnmssm , the combination of @xmath29 ( essentially the sum of the transverse momenta and ) and the signal rate has sensitivity to distinguish the two models .    in the next section we present the spectrum of the cnmssm . in section  3",
    "we discuss the signal , backgrounds and appropriate cuts .",
    "details of the simulation of the cnmssm signal and the standard model backgrounds , the effect of cuts , and the resulting cross sections and signal to background ratios are given in section  4 .",
    "section  5 is devoted to the comparison of the cnmssm with the cmssm , and section  6 to conclusions and an outlook .",
    "the nmssm with a scale invariant superpotential @xmath30 @xcite differs from the mssm through the replacement of the @xmath5 term in @xmath31 by the coupling to a gauge singlet superfield @xmath6 and a trilinear @xmath6 self - coupling : [ eq:2.1 ] w_mssm = h_u h_d +  ",
    "w_nmssm = s h_u h_d + s^3 +   , where we have omitted the quark / lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "hence , if the vev @xmath12 of @xmath6 is non - zero ( induced by the soft susy breaking terms ) , an effective @xmath5 term @xmath32 of the desired order of magnitude is generated and solves the @xmath5 problem of the mssm @xcite .",
    "apart from the yukawa couplings in the superpotential and the gauge couplings , the lagrangian of the nmssm depends on soft susy breaking scalar masses for the higgs fields @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 , the squarks and the sleptons ; trilinear couplings among the scalars ( proportional to the couplings in the superpotential ) ; and gaugino masses for the bino ( @xmath33 ) , the winos ( @xmath34 ) and the gluino ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "assuming supersymmetry breaking from a hidden sector in minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , the susy breaking terms are assumed to be universal at the scale of grand unification ( near the planck scale ) and denoted as @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "hence the parameters of the corresponding cnmssm are , apart from the gauge and quark / lepton yukawa couplings , [ eq:2.2 ] m_0 ,  a_0 ,  m_1/2 ,   .",
    "it is convenient to fix @xmath36 from the requirement that the higgs vevs @xmath37 and @xmath38 generate the correct value of @xmath39 .    as mentioned in the introduction and discussed in detail in @xcite , the remaining parameters in ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) are strongly constrained : @xmath9 must be small such that the vev @xmath12 is non - zero .",
    "a small non - zero value for @xmath9 affects essentially only the singlet - like cp - even higgs mass @xcite , which is irrelevant for the present study ; hence we assume @xmath40 in the following . in order to avoid a @xmath41 lsp",
    ", the singlino ( the fermionic component of @xmath6 ) must be lighter such that @xmath41 is the nlsp .",
    "the singlino relic density can be reduced to an amount compatible with wmap constraints , if its co - annihilation rate with the @xmath41 is large enough , i.e. if the corresponding mass difference is sufficiently small .",
    "this fixes @xmath42 @xcite",
    ". finally @xmath43 must also be quite small , since @xmath43 induces mixings in the cp - even higgs sector between the doublet- and singlet - like higgs states : if the singlet - like higgs state is heavier than the ( standard model like )",
    "higgs state @xmath44 , the mass of @xmath44 falls below the lep bound of @xmath21  gev if @xmath43 is too large ; if the mass of singlet - like higgs state is below @xmath45 ( below @xmath46  gev as for the point p520 in table  [ tab:1 ] below ) , its coupling to the @xmath47 boson violates again lep bounds @xcite for @xmath43 too large .",
    "all in all one finds @xmath48 @xcite ( but @xmath49 in order still to allow for singlino-@xmath41 co - annihilation ) .",
    "@xmath43 induces also mixings between the singlet - like neutralino and the mssm - like neutralinos ( bino , neutral wino and higgsinos ) . for @xmath48 ,",
    "these mixings are very small . hence the couplings of the singlino - like lsp @xmath17 to all mssm - like sparticles ( squarks , gluino , sleptons , charginos and neutralinos ) , which are induced by these mixings , are very small as well . accordingly branching ratios of all these sparticles into the singlino - like lsp are negligibly small , unless a decay into @xmath17 is the only decay possible . due to r - parity conservation",
    "this is the case for the nlsp , the @xmath41 .",
    "hence sparticle decay cascades proceed as in the mssm ( with a spectrum as in the cnmssm , but without the singlet - like states ) until the @xmath41 nlsp is produced .",
    "depending on @xmath43 , the width of the final decay @xmath50 can be so small , that the @xmath41 decay vertex is visibly displaced @xcite .",
    "this case ( where the displaced vertex corresponds to the production of a soft @xmath0-lepton ) could be another interesting signature for the cnmssm , but subsequently we will not assume that @xmath43 is so small that this phenomenon occurs .    concerning the remaining parameter @xmath10 , we find that the lep constraints on the higgs sector require @xmath22  gev .",
    "then , all bounds on sparticle masses from colliders as well as constraints from b - physics are satisfied . for the calculation of the spectrum we use the code nmspec @xcite within nmssmtools @xcite , updated including radiative corrections to the higgs sector from @xcite . the dark matter relic density is computed with the help of micromegas @xcite",
    ". clearly , very large values of @xmath10 are generally disfavoured by fine - tuning arguments ; moreover , smaller values of @xmath51  tev allow to explain the discrepancy of the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with the standard model @xcite .",
    "subsequently we confine ourselves to @xmath52  tev . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we show the values for @xmath11 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( @xmath11 is determined by the correct dark matter relic density , whereas @xmath55 and @xmath54 are obtained as output ) as well as the higgs and sparticle spectra for @xmath56  gev and 1  tev for @xmath40 and @xmath57 .",
    ".input parameters , @xmath55 , @xmath54 and low - energy spectra for four points of the with @xmath40 and @xmath58 . in the last line",
    "we give the total nlo cross sections for the production of all sparticles at the lhc . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath59 spectrum for the mssm points , together with p520 , p600 and the sm background , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : meff_mssm ] .",
    "first , the point mssml ( with similar @xmath17 and @xmath16 masses as the point p520 ) has not only a larger signal cross section as compared to p520 , but we see that its maximum of @xmath59 is visibly shifted towards smaller values .",
    "can we distinguish the point mssmh from any of the cnmssm points ?",
    "due to the similar squark / gluino masses as p520 , mssmh has its maximum of @xmath59 in the same region as p520 , but a significantly smaller signal rate .",
    "the signal rate for the cnmssm point p600 of about 58  fb is still larger than 41  fb for mssmh .",
    "( the difference is slightly larger than a conservative error of 20 - 30% on the theoretical cross section prediction . ) on the other hand we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : meff_mssm ] that the maximum of @xmath59 for p600 is shifted towards larger values due to the heavier squarks / gluinos : the root mean square of the distributions is about 500  gev and the difference of the average effective mass is about 130  gev , so that the error on the average effective mass for 1  fb@xmath60 is about 70  gev , i.e. , about two times smaller than the difference .",
    "the average effective mass is affected somewhat by the tails for large effective mass . using a simple fit of the distributions , the peak to peak difference increases slightly to about 150  gev providing for a stronger separation of mssmh and p600 .",
    "any cnmssm point with still heavier squarks / gluinos ( such that the signal rate coincides with the one for mssmh ) will imply a maximum for still larger values of @xmath59 .",
    "hence , the cnmssm points have either measurably larger signal rates after applying the cnmssm cuts ( if the maxima of @xmath59 coincide with a mssm point ) , or maxima at measurably larger values of @xmath59 ( if the signal rates coincide with a mssm point ) .",
    "additionally one can compare the cross section ratios after the generic supersymmetric 4j0l cut , which are 242  fb ( mssmh , where squarks are somewhat lighter than gluinos ) as compared to 47  fb ( p600 , where gluinos are somewhat heavier than squarks ) .",
    "hence , given a corresponding signal in the data , a careful comparison of both the signal rates for generic and dedicated searches and the maximum of @xmath59 ( possibly including in addition the transverse momentum of the tau lepton ) should allow to distinguish the cnmssm from the mssm in the stau coannihilation region .",
    "in the present paper we have proposed criteria for the search for the fully constrained nmssm at the lhc . in view of the relatively heavy squarks and gluinos in the cnmssm and correspondingly small production cross sections ,",
    "this task is not quite trivial . on the other hand , due to the large number of @xmath0-leptons in the final states , signatures involving hadronic @xmath0 decays are relatively efficient .",
    "whereas the soft @xmath0-leptons in the final states are difficult to use , the requirement of at least one hard @xmath0-lepton has a relatively large signal acceptance .    combining this requirement with relatively hard cuts on the transverse momenta of two jets and @xmath61",
    "as specified at the end of section  3 , the signal to background ratio is significantly improved with respect to the more standard 4j0l or 4jtau analyses .",
    "this result was obtained after simulations including detector effects and a @xmath0 acceptance , which we compared with and checked against the analysis of susy signals by the atlas group .",
    "hence , already an integrated luminosity of 1  fb@xmath60 ( at 14  tev c.m . energy ) becomes sensitive to part of the parameter space of the cnmssm whereas , trivially , more luminosity is required in case of heavier squarks and gluinos .",
    "in any case we believe that the cuts proposed here are the most sensitive ones to the parameter space of the cnmssm .",
    "in addition we have discussed in how far a refined analysis employing both the signal rate and the maximum of @xmath59 allows to distinguish the cnmssm from the mssm in the stau coannihilation region .    in the near future",
    "the lhc is on track to accumulate an integrated luminosity of 1  fb@xmath60 at 7  tev c.m .",
    "energy at the end of 2011 .",
    "we have estimated the number of signal events for the point p520 , if we lower the cnmssm cuts correspondingly : for two jets we require @xmath62 and 20  gev , respectively , and @xmath63  gev .",
    "we obtain about 5 signal events passing these cuts . for our analysis of signals of the cnmssm at 14  tev c.m .",
    "energy we have left aside the presence of two soft @xmath0 leptons per event which represent , in principle , a spectacular signature for this class of models . in some regions of the parameter space of the cnmssm  for very small values of @xmath43 and/or a small @xmath16-@xmath17 mass difference  the life time of @xmath16 can be very small leading to displaced vertices of the decay @xmath64 into these soft @xmath0-leptons .",
    "using dedicated track - based algorithms , the search for these soft @xmath0-leptons originating from displaced vertices is perhaps not completely hopeless .    in the framework of the general nmssm",
    ", a singlino - like lsp can be accompagnied by a nlsp different from @xmath16 .",
    "the signatures of these scenarios would be very different from the ones discussed here ( depending on the nature of the nlsp ) , and should also be investigated in the future .",
