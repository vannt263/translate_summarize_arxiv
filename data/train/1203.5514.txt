    "the principal cause of all manifestations of solar activity is the magnetic field of the sun , which , through the process of its development , displays a surprising symmetry .",
    "the magnetic field of the sun displays the 22-year periodicity in two ways ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) .",
    "the first of the 22-year cycles is related to the global magnetic field of the sun ( as a magnetic dipole ) with a change of sign every 11 years , after the solar - activity maximum .",
    "another 22-year periodicity is connected with local magnetic fields ( magnetic fields of sunspots ) . according to the hale polarity law , at each minimum of solar activity , sunspots of a new cycle appear in each of the sun s hemispheres with the sign of the leading sunspots opposite to the sign of the following sunspots in the same hemisphere and opposite to the sign of the leading sunspots of the other hemisphere .",
    "the signs of the leading and following sunspots remain constant up to the following minimum when sunspots of a new 11-year cycle appear with polarities opposite to the previous ones .",
    "thus , the magnetic field of the sun varies with a 22-year periodicity that manifests itself both in the global magnetic field change , and in the change of local magnetic fields of the sun .",
    "there exist certain regularities in the changes of the global and the local magnetic fields during a 22-year solar cycle .",
    "when one considers the two magnetic cycles as a unique process , we see that in the course of a 22-year magnetic cycle there are moments when the relation between the polarities of the global and local magnetic fields changes .",
    "these moments are related either to the change of the sun s global magnetic - field polarity during high solar activity , or to the alternation of the polarities of leading and following sunspots at the solar - activity minimum .",
    "thus , during a 22-year cycle there are four intervals where the polarities of the global magnetic field and of the leading sunspots for each of the hemispheres are constant .",
    "these four intervals are from the solar - activity minimum to the magnetic - field reversal of the sun and from the reversal to the next minimum in an even 11-year solar cycle , and analogously for the next odd cycle .",
    "the relations between the polarities of the global and local magnetic fields will repeat themselves in the next 22-year cycle .",
    "there is one remarkable feature that we used in addition to this : for all ascending phases of solar activity from a minimum to the reversal the sign of the global field always coincides with the sign of the leading sunspot in the same hemisphere : for the northern hemisphere for an even cycle these signs will be minus , and for an odd cycle the signs are plus .    thus , seen on a longer time scale , the distributions of the local and the global magnetic field exhibit a symmetry with respect to the solar equator . at the same time , an asymmetry is observed in the magnetic fields , that manifests itself in three different forms : as the longitudinal asymmetry , as the north ",
    "south asymmetry , and as the asymmetry of the leading and following sunspots in an active region .",
    "we found it to be essential to divide a 22-year magnetic cycle into four intervals where the polarities of the local and global magnetic fields are constant when we considered the longitudinal distribution of sunspots @xcite and of photospheric magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal distribution for the ascending phase and the maximum sharply differ from the longitudinal distribution for the descending phase and the minimum of the solar cycle .",
    "active longitudes change by @xmath3 when we pass from the ascending to the descending phase .",
    "the maximum of the longitudinal distribution is reached at @xmath3 for the ascending phase and the maximum of the solar cycle when the polarities of the leading spot and of the global field coincide in each hemisphere , and at @xmath4 for the descending phase and the minimum when these polarities are opposite .    an analogous pattern of the active longitudes was discovered for coronal mass ejections by . in a manner similar to the results of and , two nearly antipodal longitudes dominated alternately : the domination of the longitude @xmath3 coincided with the ascending phase and the maximum , while the domination of the longitude @xmath5 coincided with the descending phase and the minimum of the solar cycle .",
    "there also exists an asymmetry between the leading and following sunspots in an active region @xcite . in his survey",
    "considered the question : `` why are leading polarity spots in an active region often larger than following polarity spots ? '' as one of the important open questions .",
    "asymmetry of the leading and following polarities of an active region are of interest and are discussed in many publications ( see ; ; , and references therein ) .",
    "another aspect of the solar - activity asymmetry is the north ",
    "south asymmetry that was discovered when investigating various forms of solar activity , such as sunspots , flares , or sudden disappearances of solar prominences ( see ; ; , and references therein ) .",
    "it was observed that there are some common features in the behavior of the north ",
    "south asymmetry for different solar - activity indices @xcite .",
    "for example , during the period of the northern sunspot dominance , 78% of solar flares were observed in this hemisphere @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown by that the north ",
    "south asymmetry of solar flares does not follow the 11- or 22-year cycle of the occurrence of major flares . the north ",
    "south asymmetry of sunspot areas ( see , and references therein ) shows three significant peaks in the power spectrum with periods of 43.25 , 8.65 , and 1.44 years . for the north ",
    "south asymmetry of sunspot groups the long - term period has been found to be about 80 years @xcite and about 110 years @xcite .",
    "the north ",
    "south asymmetry is important for the topology of the interplanetary space , and it influences both interplanetary and near - earth space parameters .",
    "for example , it affects the position of the heliospheric current sheet ( see ; , and references therein ) and leads to a difference in the number of away - from - the - sun and toward - the - sun interplanetary - magnetic - field - sector days @xcite . since some mechanisms of cosmic - ray modulation depend on the current sheet , the north ",
    "south asymmetry of solar activity must be taken into consideration when investigating cosmic - ray modulation .",
    "of special interest in the framework of the present article is the change of the north ",
    "south asymmetry in the course of 11-year solar cycle . and noted that the north dominates during the ascending phase of the cycle while the south dominates during the declining phase .",
    "showed that for cycles @xmath6 the sign of the north ",
    "south asymmetry of the sudden disappearance of solar prominences changed from positive to negative during the solar maximum at the time of the sun s magnetic - field reversal .",
    "studied the north ",
    "south asymmetry of solar flares and showed that the majority of flares was concentrated in the northern hemisphere before 1970 and in the southern hemisphere after 1970 ( the year of the reversal ) .",
    "the heliographic distribution of significant @xmath7 and x - ray flares has been studied during the period @xmath8 @xcite , who found that the northern hemisphere dominates in the ascending part of each solar cycle and the southern hemisphere dominates in the descending part .",
    "collected 20 different solar - activity phenomena to investigate solar activity in solar cycle 21 , and found that solar activity has a northern bias at first , and as the cycle progresses , southern predominance takes over . the pronounced north ",
    "south asymmetry in the distribution and the number of cmes in cycle 23 observed by the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",
    "spacecraft was reported by : this asymmetry is in favor of the northern hemisphere at the beginning of the cycle , and of the southern hemisphere from 2001 ( the year of the reversal ) onward .    the behavior of the north  south asymmetry during the sun s global magnetic - field reversal is of special importance .",
    "the transition of the dominant role from the northern hemisphere to the southern one during the time of the reversal was found for sunspot area for cycles @xmath9 @xcite and for the solar - flare index and solar - group area for solar cycles @xmath10 @xcite",
    ". studied the north ",
    "south asymmetry using a vector summation of the sunspot areas that reduced the stochastic , longitudinally evenly distributed sunspot activity and , therefore , emphasized the more systematic , longitudinally asymmetric sunspot activity .",
    "we found a systematic alternation of the dominant hemisphere during high solar - activity periods , which is reproduced from cycle to cycle .",
    "this effect was analyzed for cycles",
    "@xmath9 by a superposed - epoch method using the date of magnetic reversal in the southern hemisphere as the zero - epoch time to obtain an average pattern of the north  south asymmetry .",
    "discovered analogous patterns ( although with slightly different lengths of the domination periods ) for solar - flare index and solar - group area for solar cycles 21 and 22 .",
    "the connection of north  south asymmetry with the phase difference of solar activity in the two hemispheres was established in many articles .",
    "has shown that because of a phase shift , the hemisphere preceding in time is more active on the ascending branch of the solar cycle , whereas on the descending branch the hemisphere following in time dominates .",
    "the phase shift changes its sign every four cycles so that the full period contains eight 11-year cycles .",
    "this periodicity was observed for solar cycles @xmath11 .",
    "various methods were proposed to distinguish the two effects : real asymmetry , _",
    "i.e. _ difference between the strength of the solar cycle in the two hemispheres , and phase asymmetry . by using the cross - recurrence plot technique",
    "it was shown that the north  south sunspot asymmetry is due to phase asynchrony between northern and southern hemispheric activities (;",
    "the persistence of phase - leading in one of the hemispheres exhibited a secular variation . beginning from solar cycle 13 and up to the end of cycle 16 , the north was leading in time .",
    "after this epoch and until the beginning of cycle 20 , the situation was reversed . after cycle 20",
    "it was restored to the situation that was observed before cycle 16 .",
    "later these results were extended for the period of 300 years as far back as to the maunder minimum @xcite .",
    "have analyzed the phase asynchrony of hemispheric flare activity for the period of @xmath12 . during this period ,",
    "flare activity in the northern hemisphere developed six months earlier than that in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the empirical - mode decomposition showed that the main periodicities of flare activity in the northern hemisphere slightly differ from those in the southern one , which should also lead to phase asynchrony between them .",
    "another approach was used by , who represented the cycle profile by its centre of mass . for solar cycles",
    "@xmath13 the phase of the hemispheric cycles shows an alternating variation : the northern cycle led in four cycles and followed in four cycles .",
    "this period approximately corresponded to the length of the gleissberg cycle .",
    "as pointed out by the authors , this periodicity may not be absolutely rigid if the mechanism controlling this variation is not part of the solar dynamo .",
    "although this variation persisted for the last 14 solar cycles , it seems that phase relations are violated for solar cycle 24 @xcite where the northern hemisphere again precedes the southern one , contrary to the expected change of domination .",
    "the magnetic fluxes of the sun and their imbalance have been studied by many authors on the basis of different data that characterize the magnetic activity .",
    "the problem of the nature of the imbalance is widely discussed in the literature . as stated by",
    ", the theory can not explain why the positive or the negative field dominates for one year or more practically over the whole sun , or , more precisely , over the visible hemisphere .",
    "the observed prevalence of the negative mean magnetic field of the sun as a star in @xmath14 and @xmath15 could not be compensated by the northern field of the polar regions .",
    "studied the magnetic - flux imbalance of active regions using the longitudinal magnetograms obtained from the national solar observatory at kitt peak .",
    "the median value of the flux imbalance in 137 active regions was found to be about 9.5% .",
    "the global - flux imbalance in the active latitude zone of @xmath16 is solar - cycle dependent .",
    "the flux imbalance is lower than 5% when the active zones located in both hemispheres are considered .",
    "as demonstrated by these results , there are numerous manifestations of asymmetric features of solar activity and the sun s magnetic fields .",
    "further research is needed to combine all varieties of these phenomena within the framework of the generalized model of the solar dynamo .",
    "the present article is concerned with the asymmetry of strong photospheric magnetic fields ( @xmath1 g ) of the equatorial region ( helio - latitudes from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ) .",
    "we consider the north ",
    "south asymmetry of the magnetic fluxes as well as the imbalance between the positive and negative fluxes .    in section  [ secdatameth ]",
    "we describe the data and discuss the method applied in the article .",
    "section  [ secnsasym ] is devoted to the north ",
    "south asymmetry of the photospheric magnetic field . in section  [ secnands ] , positive and negative magnetic fields and their imbalance in each of the solar hemispheres are considered .",
    "the imbalance of positive and negative magnetic fluxes for the whole latitude range from @xmath17 to @xmath18 is considered in section  [ secimbal ] , while in section  [ seclead ] we are concerned with the relations between the imbalance of the fluxes and the properties of the leading and following sunspots . in section  [ secconcl ]",
    "we discuss and interpret the results obtained and draw our conclusions .",
    "for this study we used synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field produced at the national solar observatory / kitt peak ( available at http://nsokp.nso.edu[nsokp.nso.edu ] ) .",
    "these data cover the period from 1975 to 2003 ( carrington rotations @xmath19 ) .",
    "because the data have many gaps during the initial period of observations , we included in our analysis the data starting from carrington rotation 1646 .",
    "synoptic maps have the following spatial resolution : @xmath20 in longitude ( 360 steps ) ; 180 equal steps in the sine of the latitude from @xmath21 ( south pole ) to @xmath22 ( north pole ) .",
    "thus every map consists of @xmath23 pixels of magnetic - flux values .",
    "strong magnetic fields of both polarities occupy a relatively small part of the sun s surface .",
    "the magnetic - field strength for the period @xmath0 shows a nearly symmetric distribution with 98.7% of values in the @xmath24 g interval , whereas pixels with magnetic strength above @xmath25 g occupy only 1.3% of the solar surface .",
    "even so , the total number of the latter pixels is large enough , amounting to @xmath26 for @xmath0 , and thus allowing detailed analysis of strong magnetic fields and their temporal changes .",
    "we focused here on the photospheric magnetic fields connected with solar active regions . to do this , we limited our research to the near - equatorial and strong magnetic fields . from here on only equatorial magnetic fields are considered , _",
    "i.e. _ helio - latitudes from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . to calculate the magnetic flux only pixels with magnetic field strengths higher than @xmath25 g were selected .",
    "this approach allowed us to investigate changes of the photospheric magnetic field connected with active areas on the sun , among which bipolar sunspot groups play an important role .",
    "for each synoptic map , magnetic fluxes for the northern and southern hemispheres were analyzed separately .",
    "fluxes for positive and negative magnetic fields were calculated for each of the hemispheres .",
    "thus , for each synoptic map four different characteristics of magnetic flux were obtained : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . for each solar cycle ,",
    "positive and negative fluxes in the northern hemisphere [ @xmath31 and @xmath28 ] coincide in sign with the fields of the leading or following sunspots .",
    "the same is true for the southern hemisphere where the polarities of the leading ( following ) sunspots are opposite to those of the northern hemisphere .",
    "it is expected that under our restrictions ( strong magnetic fields of the sunspot zone ) each of the four fluxes is connected with the sunspots of either leading or following polarity , but they are not identical to the sunspot fluxes .",
    "we studied the changes of these fluxes , as well as temporal changes of the difference between positive and negative fluxes .",
    "we considered the total flux of the northern hemisphere ( latitudes from @xmath33 to @xmath18 ) as the sum of absolute values both of positive and negative fluxes [ @xmath34 and the total flux of the southern hemisphere ( latitudes from @xmath33 to @xmath17 ) as @xmath35 , respectively .    in figure  [ nshemisph ] , total magnetic fluxes for the northern and southern hemispheres",
    "are shown for 19762003 . to exclude random fluctuations ,",
    "flux values were smoothed using adjacent averaging over 20 solar rotations . both fluxes change following the 11-year cycle of solar activity . however , some differences between fluxes of the northern and southern hemispheres can be seen . during the ascending phase of the solar cycle , the northern hemisphere dominates , while during the descending phase the southern hemisphere always dominates the northern one .",

    "this rule can be formulated as follows : each of the 11-year cycles can be divided into two parts , the ascending phase and the descending phase of solar activity . for each of these parts ,",
    "the following effects take place :    \\i ) in the ascending phase the northern hemisphere always dominates the southern one ;    \\ii ) during reversal the dominant hemisphere changes so that in the descending phase to the solar minimum the southern hemisphere always dominates .",
    "this effect can not be seen in the north ",
    "south asymmetry averaged for long - term periods such as the 11-year cycle or longer .",
    "on the other hand , strong fluctuations mask the effect if one considers short time intervals . yet",
    "these features are clearly seen after averaging of the data over 20 solar rotations .",
    "maxima of the north  south asymmetry amount to @xmath38% of the average magnetic flux for @xmath0 .",
    "the close connection of the asymmetry with the solar - cycle phase is clearly seen during the three cycles .",
    "we emphasized in the introduction that characteristic points of the 22-year magnetic cycle play important roles for the solar - activity development .",
    "these points are : i ) reversal of the global magnetic field of the sun ( after the solar - activity maximum ) and ii ) change of sign of the leading and following sunspots in each of the hemispheres according to hale s law ( at solar - activity minimum ) . between these points the sign of the global magnetic field and the sign of leading sunspots for each of the hemispheres is constant .",
    "thus , for each quarter of the 22-year magnetic cycle the polarities of the global and local magnetic fields of the sun remain constant .",
    "as was shown , in the ascending phase up to the reversal , the magnetic flux of the northern hemisphere always dominates when compared with the flux of the southern hemisphere . at this time the leading sunspots of the northern hemisphere have the same polarity as the global field in the northern hemisphere . after the reversal , the sign of the global field in the northern hemisphere coincides with the sign of leading sunspots in the southern hemisphere . at the same time",
    ", we see that the dominant hemisphere has changed as well : domination passes to the southern hemisphere .",
    "an important conclusion follows : leading sunspots of the dominant hemisphere have the same polarity as the global magnetic field in the northern hemisphere .",
    "it should be noted that these results are true for the period of solar cycles @xmath2 when the activity of the northern hemisphere preceded that of the southern hemisphere ( see introduction ) .",
    "these results are summarized in table  [ polarity ] .",
    "we present the 22-year period ( cycles 21 and 22 ) , divided into four quarters .",
    "commonly , two consecutive solar cycles are combined into a 22-year magnetic cycle , starting with an even one @xcite . because we have no data for the whole of cycle 23 , we considered the odd  even pair of cycles .",
    "the first quarter of the 22-year period includes the ascending phase of cycle 21 from the minimum to the reversal ; the second quarter is a period of the descending phase of cycle 21 from the reversal to the minimum . similarly , cycle 22 is divided into two parts . for each of these quarters the following characteristics are shown : i ) the global magnetic - field sign ( northern hemisphere ) ; ii ) the dominant hemisphere ; iii ) the sign of leading sunspots of the dominant hemisphere .",

    "it has been shown that the balance of magnetic fluxes is not observed for all classes of sunspot groups @xcite . moreover , the longitude - averaged magnetic field of active regions does not become zero , the sign of the field being determined by the polarity of leading sunspots @xcite . for the northern hemisphere during odd solar cycles , magnetic fields with positive polarity slightly exceed in strength the fields of the opposite sign , occupying at the same time smaller areas .",
    "note that according to our results not only the strength [ @xmath52 , but also the flux of positive fields in the northern hemisphere ( @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the sunspot area ) exceeds the flux of the opposite sign during odd cycles .    the imbalance between magnetic fields of different polarities ( figures  [ imbnorth2 ] and [ imbsouth2 ] ) may be connected with the asymmetry in morphology of the leading and following sunspots .",

    "we were concerned here with the photospheric magnetic fields connected with solar active regions . therefore , we confined ourselves to the study of the near - equatorial helio - latitudes ( @xmath85 ) and strong magnetic fields ( @xmath1 g ) .",
    "for the northern and southern hemispheres , fluxes of positive and of negative photospheric magnetic fields were evaluated to obtain four resulting fluxes : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath86 . since we considered the sunspot region and only took into account strong fields , the main contribution to the flux of positive ( negative ) polarity for each hemisphere could be attributed to the flux of the leading or the following sunspots with the corresponding polarities .",
    "thus , each of the four fluxes may be considered as the flux of leading ( following ) sunspots in one of the hemispheres .",

    "the sign of the imbalance does not change during the 11 years from one reversal to the next and always coincides with the sign of the sun s polar magnetic field in the northern hemisphere .",
    "we showed that the imbalance of the magnetic fluxes of the leading sunspots ( 15% ) has the same sign as the total imbalance ( figure  [ leading ] ) and is in antiphase with the imbalance of the fluxes of the following sunspots ( figure  [ leadfollow2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the domination of the leading sunspots in one of the hemispheres determines the sign of the magnetic flux imbalance .",

    "the imbalance of the following sunspot fluxes is in antiphase with the imbalance of the leading sunspot fluxes .",
    "this means that domination of leading sunspots of a certain polarity is accompanied by the domination of following sunspots with opposite polarity in the same hemisphere .",

    "south asymmetry of the magnetic flux displays a regular alternation of the dominant hemisphere for solar cycles @xmath2 ( see figure  [ nsasym ] and table  [ polarity ] ) . in the ascending phase ( from solar - activity minimum to the reversal ) the northern hemisphere always dominates . during the reversal the dominant role passes to the southern hemisphere , which prevails until the next minimum . near the solar - activity minimum , the northern hemisphere becomes dominant again .",
    "data considered in our analysis ( @xmath0 ) refer to the four schwabe cycles ( @xmath87 ) , when activity of the northern hemisphere was leading in time ( see introduction ) . the regular change of the north  south asymmetry of the magnetic flux that we observed agrees with this effect .",
    "the domination of leading sunspots in one of the hemispheres determines the sign of the magnetic - flux imbalance . at the moment of the reversal ,",
    "the relative roles of leading sunspots change with the subsequent domination of leading sunspots with opposite polarity . during the solar - activity minimum ,",
