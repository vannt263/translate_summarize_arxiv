    "financial markets are complex systems where the simultaneous activity of a huge number of investors performs the task of finding the correct price of an asset through the action of trading .",
    "the way in which this collective task is obtained is only partially understood .",
    "theoretical and computational models of investors trading in a financial markets are very helpful in reproducing stylized facts and allow to investigate how specific cognitive assumptions and investment strategies affect the price dynamics @xcite .",
    "theoretical and computational models often classify investors in stylized classes such as the ones of fundamentalists and chartists @xcite sometime specialized in contrarian @xcite and momentum @xcite investors .",
    "theoretical and computational models also distinguish between informed and uninformed trading action , for example see @xcite , up to the limit case of considering the presence of only noise driven zero intelligence traders @xcite . in the above cited studies",
    ", the assumptions on the presence of different classes of investors are motivated by theoretical considerations , results of surveys and direct investigations of the trading profile of classes of investors ( see @xcite for some examples of these investigations ) .    even if theoretical and computational models take into account some type of agent s heterogeneity , analytical tractability or the need to keep low the number of model parameters force researchers to introduce a small number of groups of investors characterized by a specific type of strategy . without an empirical verification of the underlying assumptions , the assessment of the real amount of heterogeneity present in a market and the detection of its role in the price formation dynamics lack an empirical support .",
    "there are at least two reasons why such empirical investigations are difficult to be realized .",
    "first , due to confidentiality reasons , it is very difficult to have access to data allowing to track the trading activity of a large set of individual investors for a long period of time .",
    "second , even when the data are available , the identification of groups of investors trading in similar way is a complicated data mining task .    in this paper",
    "we make a first step in this direction by employing a recently developed and powerful data mining technique , termed statistically validated networks ( svn ) @xcite , for the analysis of a very special database , namely a database allowing to track the trading activity of individual investors of finnish stocks . with our approach",
    "we are able to identify groups of investors that trade in a very similar way over extended periods of time .",
    "this commonality of behavior can be due to the use of very similar trading strategies and can be seen as a strong form of herding .",
    "one of the most surprising results is that in some groups we find a very high degree of synchronization in agent s trading activity , both in terms of when they decide to trade ( as opposed to maintain their position ) and in terms of the specific activity ( i.e. buy , sell , or buying and selling approximately the same amount of shares in a given day ) performed in a given day . in this paper",
    "we will not investigate why the identified groups follow a specific trading patterns , i.e. we will not attempt here a reverse engineering approach to infer strategies from trading activity of investors .",
    "this is the topic of a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "our main focus here is in the identification and compositional characterization of the identified clusters of investors .",
    "the task of identifying groups of investors and infer their strategies and interactions from empirical data is receiving an increasing interest in recent years .",
    "some papers @xcite have investigated databases where it is possible to track the trading behavior of market members of the exchange .",
    "members are credit entities and investment firms which are the only firms entitled to trade directly",
    ". therefore they trade on behalf of a large number of investors . despite this fact",
    ", recent studies have shown that , probably due to a customer specialization , market member data allows to identify trading strategies , such as order splitting @xcite , liquidity provision @xcite , and contrarian or momentum trading @xcite .",
    "in particular in this last study authors have performed an analysis of the linear correlation matrix of the trading activity of market members of the spanish stock exchange in order to identify groups of investors ( market members in this case ) .",
    "it is important to stress that , as will be clear in the following , this approach can not be pursued with the finnish data of individual investors investigated here .",
    "the main reason is the extreme heterogeneity in the trading activity of individual investors ( heterogeneity is not so significant for market member data ) .",
    "for this reason in this paper we use the more sophisticated svn to identify clusters of investors .",
    "other studies have had access to databases with the resolution of the individual investors ( see for example @xcite for the profit analysis of taiwanese investors , @xcite for the analysis of the flash crash of may 6 , 2010 or @xcite for the investigation of order splitting for individual investors ) .",
    "the database used in this paper has been investigated extensively by grinblatt and keloharju in a series of studies @xcite on the trading profile of individual and institutional investors , and on behavioral aspects of individual investors .",
    "however to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study that attempts an unsupervised identification of groups of individual investors in a financial market .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the system and the special database investigated in this study . in section iii we describe the categorical variables used to characterize the trading activity of the investors and we introduce the bipartite system under investigation .",
    "section iv describes the statistically validated networks of investors and section v investigates the clusters detected in the statistical validated networks . finally , section vi concludes .",
    "we investigate the trading activity of institutional and individual single investors by using a special database maintained by the euroclear finland ( previously nordic central securities depository finland ) .",
    "the database is the central register of shareholdings for finnish stocks and financial assets in the finnish central securities depository ( fcsd ) .",
    "practically all major publicly traded finnish companies have joined the register .",
    "the register reports the shareholdings in fcsd stocks of all finnish investors and of all foreign investors asking to exercise their vote right , both retail and institutional",
    ". the database records official ownership of companies and financial assets and the trading records are updated on a daily basis according to the finnish book entry system .",
    "the records include all the transactions , executed in worldwide stock exchanges and in other venues , which change the ownership of the assets .",
    "the database classifies investors into six main categories : non - financial corporations , financial and insurance corporations , general governmental organizations , non - profit institutions , households , and foreign organizations .",
    "the database is collected since january 1st , 1995 .",
    "we have access to the database for the period 1995 - 2008 , under a special agreement with euroclear finland . in this paper",
    "we investigate the trading activity of the nokia stock , which is the most capitalized stock in the finnish stock market .",
    "note that the database covers transactions of nokia in all financial markets where this company is listed .",
    "however , while the database contains very detailed information about the finnish domestic investors , foreign investors can choose to use nominee registration .",
    "in this case , the investor s book entry account provider aggregates all the transactions from all of its accounts , and a single nominee register coded identity contains the holdings of several foreign investors .",
    "this means that our results describe in detailed way the actions of all the finnish domestic investors and those foreign investors who do not use nominee registration , while a very small fraction of the coded identities correspond to aggregated ownership .",
    "we consider the set of investors trading the nokia stock during the period of time from 19 october 1998 to 29 december 2003 ( a set of 1,300 daily records ) and we investigate all the market transactions performed by them .",
    "the total number of investors is @xmath0 and the total number of transactions is @xmath1 .",
    "the left part of table [ tabledescr1 ] gives the number of investors , the number of transactions , and the traded volume for the six categories .",
    "it also gives these numbers separating nominee registered and non nominee registered investors .",
    ".[tabledescr1 ] summary of the number of investors ( # ids ) , the number of transactions ( @xmath2 ) , and the exchanged volume ( @xmath3 , in millions of shares ) for the entire set ( left column ) of nokia investors in the period oct .",
    "10 , 1998 - dec . 29 , 2003 and for the restricted set ( right column ) of active investors investigated in the paper ( see text for a detailed description of the set construction ) .",
    "the investors are divided in the six categories ( top part ) or between nominee and non nominee registered .",
    "note that the total volume in the table is twice the traded volume , because each transactions is counted both for the buyer and for the seller .",

    "b15 shows a over - representation of c2 ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) links ( green links ) , whereas b14 , b19 , and b27 clusters have c1 ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) ( magenta links ) . in the f8 fdr cluster",

    "the over - represented link is c4 ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) & ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) ( black links ) . ]",
    "[ netf8 ]    we provide a concrete example of the above discussed concepts by comparing the f8 cluster of the fdr network and b14 , b15 , b19 , b27 and b29 bonferroni clusters included in it . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ netf8 ] we show the f8 cluster of the fdr network . from table",
    "[ fdr30 ] we note that the f8 cluster has over - expression of investors belonging to the non - financial corporations , general governmental organizations , non - profit institutions , and financial and insurance corporations categories , whereas household investors are under - expressed .",
    "the same table shows that the over - expressed co - occurrence combination is the c4 combination ( black links in fig .",
    "[ netf8 ] ) implying the ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) and ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) co - occurrence . in the bottom panel of the same figure",
    "we show the five clusters b14 , b15 , b19 , b27 and b29 of the bonferroni network ( we show only the 135 elements which are also present in the f8 cluster of the fdr ) .",
    "the links present in the bottom panel are the links of the bonferroni network . by comparing the top panel ( fdr cluster ) and the bottom panel ( bonferroni clusters ) , we note that the bonferroni clusters describe core regions of the wider fdr clusters , and that the number of multi - links grows if we move from the bonferroni to the fdr network . in some cases , links change nature from c1 and c2 co - occurrence combinations to c4 .",
    "in fact , by analyzing table [ bonf30 ] , we see that the over - expressed multi - links of the bonferroni clusters are c1 for b14 , b19 , and b27 , and c2 for b15 .",
    "[ arrayf8 ]    moving from the fdr to the bonferroni correction , we therefore increase the specificity of the system characterization and decrease its sensitivity .",
    "this aspect is summarized in fig .",
    "[ arrayf8 ] where we display the trading activities of investors of cluster f8 ( top panel ) and of clusters b14 , b15 , b19 , b27 and b29 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "note that 135 elements ( out of a total of 141 ) of the bonferroni clusters are present in the fdr cluster .",
    "the order of the investors in both panels is given according to the rank of the contribution of the single investor to the partitioning of the infomap algorithm .",
    "highest contribution is provided by investors located at the left of each region .",
    "it is worth noting that at the bonferroni level the specificity of the trading action of each cluster is quite evident and in fact differences among clusters involving trading actions of specific days can be clearly detected .",
    "the fdr cluster provides a less specific characterization but involves a larger number of investors .",
    "by using a database containing information about the trading actions of individual investors in a real financial market , we have studied how the investors different actions co - occur in the market . in particular , we have studied the trading of nokia stock for the period 1998 - 2003 by associating to each investor for all the days one of the states buy , sell or buy - sell .",
    "based on the co - occurrence of the trading actions of the investors over time , we have constructed statistically validated networks of investors .",
    "this has allowed us also to detect the clusters of investors within the networks and to characterize the observed investors clusters by the different categories investors belong to , and the type of co - occurence of trading actions , or multi - links , connecting the investors .",
    "we have found a very high degree of synchronization in the trading activity of the identified groups .",
    "this synchronization can be due to many different causes , such as the adoption of similar strategies , the recommendation of the same analysts , or a direct interaction and exchange of information among the investors .",
    "our results demonstrate that despite of the investors heterogeneity , it is indeed possible and feasible to make empirical observations and characterizations of the investors actions , to use the concepts and tools of network theory to describe this activity , and to study the clusters of investors formed in financial markets .",
    "the results presented here represent a starting point for further studies focusing on the empirical identification of the investment strategies of the agents @xcite and on the modeling of the complex interaction between clusters of agents in a market ecology .",
    "we are confident that the methods and results presented here will be important in the construction of realistic agent based models of this fascinating complex system .",
