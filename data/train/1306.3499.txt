    "considering a phase space embedded into a torus surface , with an angular constraint between polar @xmath0 and azimuthal @xmath1 angles given by @xmath2 , we have an effectively reduced degree of freedom from the torus to the ms ( figure [ mobius_line ] ) , with a trajectory described by the parametrization @xmath3 and the variation of @xmath4 leading to the ms .",
    "the cs for a quantum particle on the ms is then performed following the eigenvalue equation @xcite @xmath5 , where @xmath6 . in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the ms parametrization",
    ", the cs can be described by means of @xmath9 , that satisfies @xmath10 . in this form",
    ", the cs on the ms can be written as @xmath11 .",
    "the normalization is given in terms of jacobi theta functions @xmath12 , and the the projections relations for two different cs on a ms can be written as @xmath13 then , on a period in the ms , we have the behaviour characteristic of the topology associated to the ms . taking @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "the projections are given by @xmath16 that can be simplified , using ( [ projection ] ) , in the following form @xmath17 since the angular difference is a unity , i.e. , @xmath18 , we have that the state with a difference in the phase @xmath1 corresponding to the period @xmath19 of a ms will be the same @xmath20 , as expected from the ms topology . consequently , under a period of @xmath19 the state turns to be the same state .",
    "we can verify that this is in fact a property of scs too . considering a scs given in terms of cs of opposite angles @xmath1 and @xmath21 , including an additional phase term phase @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 ) is periodic in the ms , taking @xmath24 and @xmath25 , a period of @xmath19 , we can write @xmath26 .    now , if we relate the phase term @xmath22 directly to the ms angular variable @xmath1 , by means of @xmath27 , the states will still be periodic on ms , under a period of @xmath19 .",
    "we can also consider a scs given in terms of opposite cs states @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 , the scs @xmath31 is also periodic under @xmath19 period on ms .",
    "we can also verify that the state @xmath31 is also periodic in the case @xmath27 .",
    "the action of the operator @xmath32 on @xmath31 , leads to a scs also ms periodic , @xmath19 , @xmath33 , by means of @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath35 changes along the ms , the periodicity is still ms dependent .",
    "but the particle can realize an harmonic motion .",
    "for instance , @xmath36 , the scs carries a circle periodicity of @xmath37 on the ms , with @xmath38 . on the other hand , for @xmath39",
    "the scs carries a periodicity of @xmath19 on the ms ( figure [ mobius22 ] ) . in the case of @xmath40 , that corresponds to a cilinder parametrization @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , the scs turn to the same state after a period of @xmath37",
    "then , variations of @xmath35 in the ms generally do not alter the periodic properties of scs , leading to circle or ms periodicities .",
    "this is an important point for the study the stability of scs in the ms .     along the ms , @xmath36 and @xmath39.,title=\"fig : \" ]   along the ms , @xmath36 and @xmath39.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "cs provides a close connection between quantum and classical physics , with a suitable set of requirements , as continuity , resolution of unity , temporal stability and action identity .",
    "in particular , these properties are reflected in scs , that naturally will lead to cat states , the best analogues of classical behaviour .",
    "scs with minimal uncertainty relations can be associated to cat states , that are the best analogues of classical superpositions . in order to achieve them on ms",
    ", we have to consider the minimization of uncertainty relation in the context of ms .",
    "the uncertainty measurements associated to angular momentum @xmath44 and the phase angle @xmath45 , written in the form proposed by @xcite , for the ms case are given by @xmath46 where the expectation value of @xmath47 , associated to the cs @xmath28 on ms , can be @xmath48 , that can be simplified in terms of jacobi theta functions @xmath49 .",
    "the same procedure applied to @xmath50 , leads to @xmath51 , that , in terms of jacobi theta functions is given by @xmath52 . dividing both results by the cs normalization",
    ", we arrive at @xmath53 for the operators @xmath54 and @xmath55 the expectation value associated to the cs on ms , that will lead to @xmath56 , can be calculated as in @xmath47 case , leading to @xmath57}\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times&(1+r\\cos(\\frac{\\varphi}{2}))^{2\\lambda}\\frac{\\theta_{3}(l'-\\lambda|i\\pi)}{\\theta_{3}(l'|i\\pi)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 .     in a period of @xmath37 ,",
    "( b ) @xmath8 in a period of @xmath19.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in a period of @xmath37 , ( b ) @xmath8 in a period of @xmath19.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for sufficiently large @xmath8 , we have @xmath59 that reduces to the circle case for @xmath40 . in particular",
    ", this uncertainty relation has a set of minimum values depending on @xmath8 along a ms period @xmath19 in the angular variable ( figure [ lprima ] ) .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty relation in a more usual form @xcite @xmath60\\rangle\\right|^{2}$ ] , for the case of @xmath44 and @xmath47 , that satisfy the commutation relation @xmath61=e^{i\\hat{\\varphi}}$ ] on ms @xcite , we can also write @xmath62 that using @xmath63 we find that the minimum uncertainty relations on ms satisfy @xmath64\\right|^{2}. \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for sufficiently large @xmath8 , we have @xmath65 and the corresponding uncertainty relation is given by @xmath66 ; for @xmath67 , @xmath68 . for a small phase angle",
    "we can also write @xmath69    as a consequence , scs associated to minimum uncertainty relation states are directly related to cat states on ms , these states are important for the study of classical analogues on ms and the possibility of cs quantum computation on ms .",
    "since the cs and scs constructions on ms can be also reduced to circle topology cases , by @xmath40 or some variations of @xmath35 along the ms , this cs states are quite general .",
    "in contrast to cs for the fermions where the cylinder topology is used , forcing to introduce spin-1/2 by hand , the cs on ms is a natural framework phase space where the @xmath19 symmetry invariance emerges naturally , the symmetry properties of ms and fermions are then closely related , both with characteristic double covering that makes the symmetry invariance of @xmath19 instead of @xmath37 for the bosonic case . due to the double covering , cs on ms can also include the bosonic case , as we have showed in @xmath40 or an adequate choice of @xmath35 variation with @xmath1 angular variable .",
    "the mininum uncertainty relations for cs and scs on ms also leads to a natural phase space where cat states in a nontrivial topology can be formulated .",
    "we have considered cs and scs on ms , the uncertainty measurements associated to angular momentum and the phase angle for the ms and the connection between scs and cat states was considered . as a result , we extended previous proposes , including here the case of the uncertainty relation in the ms case .",
    "in particular , the uncertainty measurements can be associated to ms parameter @xmath8 .",
    "since the symmetry properties of ms and fermions are closely related , due to the double covering property shared by ms and fermions , symmetry invariance of @xmath19 , cs on ms naturally describes fermionic fields . due to the double covering ,",
    "cs on ms can also play the role of projector to the bosonic case @xcite , making a closer connection between classical and quantum formulations @xcite in a dirac - like quantization @xcite . when the particle is confined to a mbius topology",
    "its periodicity is similar to a fermionic behavior of a spin @xmath70 particle and the similarities can be used to investigate the couterparts associated to cat states in these systems , but it is important to emphasize that the @xmath19 invariance due to the ms topology is an invariance in the physical space , while the @xmath19 invariance associated with fermions is an invariance in the internal spin space .",
    "the behavior of cs and scs on ms are associated to a continous transformation , in contrast to the discrete behaviour of the spin system , but analogue to this one under spin rotations .",
    "cs can be very sensitive to the geometry they are constructed , the cs on ms has the advantage of recover cylinder topologies as particular cases when @xmath40 or an adequate choice of @xmath35 variation with @xmath1 angular variable .",
    "as ms is a more natural phase space for fermions symmetries of spin rotation , they can also be useful for investigating cat states analogues to fermionic fields .",
    "scs on ms are strong canditates to cat states in nontrivial topologies .",
    "this is reinforced by the minimum uncertainty relations for cs on ms .",
    "one consequence is the possibility of using cs and scs on ms to realize cvqc in nontrivial topologies .    for the scs in a period on ms , we showed the expected behaviour of periodicity in phase @xmath1 with a period of @xmath71 in the ms . in the case",
    "@xmath40 , corresponding to the case in the torus , the periodicity is , as expected , of @xmath72 . by varying @xmath35 along the ms , the particle can describe an oscillatory motion along the strip such that there is a mixing of the cases in the torus and ms cases .",
    "as the cs comes from a constraint on the torus parametrization , the cs on ms can also be connected to the cs on torus by means of the breaking of constraint between the angular variables .",
    "the topological stability of scs , as showed for particular @xmath35 variations , can also be used for cs quantum computation , topological physics on ms and formulations on riemannian superspaces @xcite .",
