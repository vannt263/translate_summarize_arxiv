    "the tw  hya association , a loose grouping of very young stars that does not appear to be related to any nearby molecular cloud material , has been the subject of considerable attention in recent years .",
    "the prototype of the association , tw hya itself , was the first recognized example of an isolated t tauri star .",
    "the first few members of the association were discovered more or less by accident , and were only later recognized to be related . aside from these , the systematic search for additional stars belonging to the group has relied on their x - ray properties ( such as their detection as a rosat source ) , or their similar kinematics ( proper motions ) .",
    "follow - up studies have been made in many cases to establish the youth of the candidate members , for example by the presence of strong lithium @xmath06708 absorption , h@xmath1 emission , infrared excess , etc . to date",
    "there are 19 objects recognized as true members in the published literature ( see , e.g. , kastner et al .",
    "1997 ; webb et al.1999 ; sterzik et al .",
    "1999 ; zuckerman et al .  2001 ) , along with many other potential members that need to be studied further .",
    "one of the goals of the present work is to investigate the kinematics of the candidate members , but in the direction to previous studies that have focussed only on proper motions .",
    "we present measurements along the line of sight ( radial velocities ) , which are complementary to the proper motions and help define the space motion of these objects .",
    "another goal of this project is to detect any spectroscopic binaries that might be present through repeated measurements of the radial velocities of our targets , and to determine their orbits .",
    "our observations were obtained using nearly identical echelle spectrographs on the mmt prior to conversion ( mt .  hopkins , az ) , the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( also on mt .",
    "hopkins , az ) , and on the 1.5 m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory ( harvard , ma ) .",
    "a single echelle order was recorded with a photon - counting reticon diode array , at a resolving power of @xmath2 and a central wavelength of 5187 .",
    "the spectral coverage is 45 .",
    "we report here on the results based on some 300 spectra , and an additional 150 archival spectra from the cfa echelle database .",
    "table 1 presents the sample of stars studied in this program , including for completeness hd  98800 ( twa-4 ) , which was observed several years ago with the same instrumental setup and was discovered to be a quadruple system ( torres et al .",

    "radial velocities were obtained using standard cross - correlation techniques ( the xcsao task running under iraf ) , as described , e.g. , by latham ( 1992 ) . the templates were taken from an extensive library of synthetic spectra based on the latest model atmospheres by kurucz ( morse & kurucz , in preparation ) . in addition , we derived effective temperatures ( @xmath10 ) and projected rotational velocities ( @xmath11 ) for all our stars by comparison with the synthetic spectra .",
    "a number of objects have turned out to be double - lined . for these we used the two - dimensional cross - correlation algorithm known as todcor ( zucker & mazeh 1994 ) , and in most cases we were able to derive the @xmath10 and @xmath12 for both components .",

    "one of such studies , by makarov & fabricius ( 2001 ) , has modeled the kinematics of the association as a moving group using a variant of the convergent - point method .",

    ", the velocity for hip 50796 agrees perfectly with the prediction .",

    "it has the lowest expected radial velocity ( @xmath28 km  s@xmath13 ) , and we do indeed measure a low value ( @xmath29 km  s@xmath13 ) .",
