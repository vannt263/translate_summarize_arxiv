    "a survey of the literature concerning analytical nonperturbative methods shows a growing interest in variational methods such as the gaussian approximation @xcite and the optimized linear @xmath1 expansion @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative variational method @xcite has been improved and successfully tested in the gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite both in the large @xcite and finite @xcite @xmath0 limits .",
    "basically this new approximation differs from the existing optimized linear @xmath1 expansion in two aspects : it provides a clear way of carrying on the renormalization program of the theory and improves the calculation with a simple but powerful analytical method which allows to attain arbitrarily large and even infinite order of perturbation in the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "our goal is to show that this calculational scheme , especially the variational procedure , still works when external parameters such as the temperature are considered . from the renormalization point of view",
    "the temperature does not create any new difficulties and the elimination of divergencies can be carried out exactly as at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "however , previous experience with the related @xmath1 expansion shows that the application of variational methods to the study of phase transitions is not necessarily straightforward @xcite .    here , our aim is to check the ability of the variational procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite in generating accurate results for the phase transition , especially near the critical temperature . in this first finite temperature application",
    "we restrict ourselves to the large @xmath0 limit of the gn model where the calculational scheme can be set up more clearly . for comparison",
    "we consider the results of refs . @xcite and @xcite as being",
    " exact \" in the large @xmath0 limit , despite their disagreement with existing theorems @xcite for symmetry breaking / restoration in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this interesting problem , which has been studied by several authors using different models [ 11 - 15 ] , will be explicitly treated in an extension of the present work @xcite .    in the next section we review the usual large @xmath0 result for the temperature dependent fermionic mass and perform the variational calculation to lowest orders .",
    "we shall see that , as in the zero temperature case , the variational procedure fails . in section iii",

    "in this section we shall follow ref .",
    "@xcite to perform an all order variational calculation in the large @xmath0 limit eliminating the optimization problem encountered in the previous section .",
    "the general philosophy within variational methods is to start with a trial value which is expected to be reasonably close to the true value of the physical parameters . in our case",
    "this means that we can start by formulating a nonperturbative ansatz which already resums a good part of the rg behaviour of the fermionic mass before launching into the actual variational calculation .",

    "one obtains @xmath8 to @xmath30 order of perturbation theory    m_f^(n)(m_0)= dz(++ ... + ) , which , at @xmath23 , gives m_f^(n)(m_0)= .",
    "once @xmath31 and @xmath32 are applied to the bare @xmath2 and @xmath33 one gets the finite expression for the dimensionless quantity @xmath34    = \\{1 + g^2 z } ^-1 . as noted in the case of the anharmonic oscillator @xcite , it is possible to extract more structure from the limit of infinite order by rescalling @xmath35 with the order @xmath29 .",
    "after distortion of the contour it is clear that only the vicinity of @xmath36 survives in the limit @xmath37 , which can be analyzed by changing variables 1- z = .",
    "rescalling @xmath35 by introducing @xmath38 we get , in the @xmath39 limit = [ oint ] , where the integration runs counterclockwise around the negative real axis . the function @xmath40 is given by k(v ) = ( ) + 2 i_1^t ( ) [ kv ] , where m^ = ( ) ^-1 , with @xmath41 . equations ( [ oint ] ) and ( [ kv ] ) , which summarize our variational approach , should be understood as follows : for a given variational parameter @xmath42 , and a given temperature @xmath43 , eq .",

    "( [ oint ] ) with respect to @xmath44 . in general",
    "this program has to be achieved numerically .",
    "however , before doing that one can use the fact that the large @xmath0 limit is free from infra red divergences to perform an analytical exploitation of the @xmath45 limit where the integral is dominated by the @xmath46 region .",

    "moreover , @xmath40 has a cut starting at a negative value of @xmath49 and lying along the negative real axis .",
    "hence , the integral eq .",
    "( [ oint ] ) converges exponentially to the expected result as @xmath50 .",
    "as @xmath51 , the branching point approaches the value @xmath52 merging to it at @xmath53 . at this point",
    "the integral becomes divergent at @xmath54 and does not allow more extrema for @xmath55 .",
    "numerical results obtained at different temperatures ( see fig . 1 ) indicate that @xmath54 is in fact the only real extremum which leads to a smooth ( second order ) phase transition occuring at the critical temperature t_c = 0.57 .",
    "the standard large @xmath0 structure of the phase transition is then exactly reproduced .",
    "in this letter , we have shown that a recently proposed variational method can be successfully generalized to the finite temperature domain . for comparison purposes , and to introduce the method in the study of phase transitions we have chosen to start with the large @xmath0 limit of the gross - neveu model .",
    "we have seen that optimization problems encountered in the zero temperature low order variational calculation persist at finite temperatures .",
    "then , by applying the all order variational calculation scheme developed in ref . @xcite we were able to recover the usual large @xmath0 result for the phase transitionof the gn model , showing that the whole calculational scheme works remarkably well at all temperatures .",
    "the finite @xmath0 case , which is interesting due to some important theorems related to phase transitions in one space dimension is also technically much more complex and will be discussed in a forthcoming work .",
