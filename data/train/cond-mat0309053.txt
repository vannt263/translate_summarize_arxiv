    "suppose we have a biased coin , so that the probability that any flip will result in a head is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a small and positive number . with this coin ,",
    "call it coin 1 , it is proposed that you play the following game : if the flip results in a tail you receive @xmath2 dollar , if not you pay the same amount .",
    "if you have unlimited capital then you should accept to play the game without hesitation : if @xmath3 is your opponent s capital after @xmath4 runs , it will not be difficult for you to show that its mean value , @xmath5 is a strictly a decreasing function of @xmath4 ( while your average capital is an increasing function of @xmath4 ) .",
    "now , it is proposed that you play a second game that uses two coins , call them coin @xmath6 and coin @xmath7 respectively .",
    "coin @xmath7 is flipped whenever your opponent s capital is a multiple of @xmath7 , in any other case coin @xmath6 is flipped ( note that your opponent can have negative capital ; by a multiple of @xmath7 it is understood any integer number that can be written as @xmath8 , with @xmath9 an integer number ) .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be the probabilities that your opponent wins with coin @xmath6 and coin @xmath7 respectively , see figure [ coins ] .",
    "the analysis of this game is not as simple as that of our previous game .",
    "however , it can be shown ",
    "see appendix 1 and figure [ coins ]  that this game , too , is favourable for you in the sense that the mean value of the opponent s capital @xmath5 is , once again , a strictly decreasing function of @xmath4 .",
    "let us call the first game we have described `` game a '' and the second one `` game b. ''    once you are convinced that your opponent will lose in both games you are given a third proposal : alternate the games following the sequence aabbaabb ... if you frown , the proposal can be modified to make it less suspicious : in each run we will randomly chose the game that is played .",
    "if you accept either of these proposals you would have trusted your intuition too much , not realizing that random systems , even as simple as the ones we have just described , may behave in an unexpected way .    indeed , if we alternate the games , either by following a fixed sequence aabbaabb ... or chosing randomly the game we play , then your opponent s average capital @xmath5 will be a strictly increasing function of @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ game_plot ] shows your opponent s capital in different situations : games a and b played alone , in several periodic combinations and in a random combination .",
    "the phenomenon we have just described is known as parrondo s paradox and it is receiving some attention @xcite because it is thought it might have application in areas such as economics and evolutionary theory .",
    "it is true that this phenomenon may arise in any situation that involves the interplay of two or more random dynamics .",
    "however , we have not yet described a real situation where the paradox takes place .",
    "let us see how we can analyse these paradoxical games .",
    "game b and the random combination of games a and b may be reduced to a 3-state markov chain @xcite .",
    "these states are : the capital is multiple of @xmath7 , multiple of @xmath7 plus @xmath2 or multiple of @xmath7 plus @xmath6 .",
    "the variable that determines these states is    @xmath12    which only takes on the values @xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "the analysis of this markov chain can be carried out by diagonalizing a @xmath14 matrix ( see appendix 1 ) .",
    "this analysis gives us the following intuitive explanation of the paradox .",
    "game b uses two coins : one  bad \" , coin @xmath7 , and one  good \" , coin @xmath6 .",
    "when game b is played alone , the probability of using coin @xmath7 is    @xmath15    where we have dropped the terms of order @xmath16 to simplify the analysis .",
    "notice , also , that the probability @xmath17 is not equal to @xmath18 , as one might have initially thought , but greater than @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , the probability of winning is    @xmath19    which is less than @xmath20 for any positive @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , when games a and b are combined randomly , the probability of using coin @xmath7 becomes    @xmath21    which is less than @xmath17 .",
    "the probability of winning is now    @xmath22    which is greater than @xmath20 if @xmath1 is small enough .",
    "what happens then is that game a , even though it consists of just one  bad \" coin , redistributes the frequencies of use of the two coins of game b in such a way that the  good \" coin is being used more often than its counterpart .",
    "this is the essence of the paradox : the winning tendency is already built - in into game b , but when this game is played alone , the losing tendency is dominant .",
    "the role of game a is to reverse this dominancy .",
    "thus , game a , in spite of being a losing game , effects a reprise of the  good \" coin of game b that overcomes its own losing tendency , so that the combination of games a and b becomes a winning game .",
    "what has all this to do with physics ?",
    "even though now the paradox is part of probability theory , it was originally inspired by a physical system , namely , a brownian motor or molecular motor @xcite .    with a slight change in the winning and losing probabilities ,",
    "the games described above could be interpreted as a brownian particle in one - dimension subjected to certain potentials .",
    "let us consider the following model of a brownian particle in one - dimension , where the particle can occupy the discrete set of positions @xmath23 .",
    "the particle jumps with certain probability from one position to another at discrete times @xmath24 suppose the particle is under the action of a certain periodic potential @xmath25 of period @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "this means the potential is completely defined by the three values : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which we denote by @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we will set @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , so that the potential is asymmetric ( see figure [ potential ] ) .",
    "in addition , suppose there is an external force @xmath36 acting on the particle and pointing to the left .",
    "the energy at each point is then    @xmath37    how does this particle move at a certain temperature @xmath38 ?",
    "when a physical system is at a certain temperature @xmath38 and can be found in different states @xmath39 with energy @xmath40 its evolution may be described by a markov chain @xcite .",
    "the dynamics are expressed in terms of the transition probabilities @xmath41 for jumping from state @xmath39 to the state @xmath42 .",
    "these probabilities must satisfy the detailed - balance condition .",
    "one of the dynamics to satisfy this requirement is the metropolis algorithm ( see appendix 2 ) that is used in monte - carlo simulations of systems in equilibrium at a certain temperature @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "when our brownian particle evolves following the metropolis algorithm at a finite temperature @xmath38 , its position @xmath3 behaves more or less like the capital in game b. on the other hand , if we follow the metropolis algorithm at a very high temperature , the resulting system is very much like game a. in both cases the external force plays the role of the games @xmath1 parameter .",
    "these analogies give us a strong indication how to reproduce the paradox in the behaviour of the brownian particle . at any temperature",
    "the particle moves to the left because this is the direction of the external force @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the mean value of @xmath5 decreases with @xmath4 . on the other hand , if we alternate two different temperatures @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the particle moves to the right against the external force , that is @xmath5 increases with @xmath4 .",
    "again , two dynamics where @xmath5 decreases give rise , when combined , to dynamics where @xmath5 increases .",
    "this phenomenon is depicted in figure [ position ] ; there we plot the position of the particle as a function of time , obtained by numerical simulation for the temperatures , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the alternating sequence @xmath47 .",
    "even more interesting is to check that the particle is a thermal engine .",
    "let us consider a periodic alternating sequence of the type @xmath48 , that is , we put the particle in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath43 for two time - steps , then in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath44 for the next two time - steps , and so on .",
    "let us assume @xmath49 .",
    "we have , thus , a system in contact with two thermal baths at different temperatures just as in the well known cycles of the classical thermal engines .",
    "so , the particle behaves exactly as a thermal engine , that is , it extracts energy from the hot source , does work against the external force and dissipates part of the extracted energy in the form of heat towards the cold source .",
    "let us see how to quantitatively study the energy exchange of this engine . in a certain step @xmath50 , in which the particle is in contact with , say , bath @xmath2 ,",
    "the energy transferred from the bath to the particle is    @xmath51(v(x)+fx)\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is the probability that the particle is at the position @xmath53 in time @xmath4 .",
    "the right hand side of the above equation can be decomposed into two terms    @xmath54    the first term is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the internal energy of the system    @xmath57    on the other hand , the second term is the change of energy due to the external force @xmath36 , that is , the work done by the force on the particle    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the mean velocity of the particle . hence equation ( [ equation10 ] ) has a simple interpretation : the work done by the force on the particle in a unit of time , or the power developed by the force , is the product of the force times the mean velocity of the particle . the minus sign arises because the direction of the force points to the left .",
    "the three quantities we have defined , the internal energy , heat and work are related through equation ( [ equation8 ] ) , which is nothing else that the first law of thermodynamics as part of the internal energy . in this interpretation ,",
    "the heat dissipated in each bath is the same as the one computed in this article .",
    "there are changes , however , in the work , which is always zero , and the internal energy .",
    "this interpretation has two problems .",
    "firstly , the engine is not strictly cyclic , because the internal energy increases in each cycle . and",
    "secondly , it is not possible to define in a simple way the efficiency of the engine . ]",
    "( the sign convention we follow is the usual one in physics , namely , that heat and work are both positive if there is energy entering the system ) .",
    "the same procedure is applied to the time - steps when the system is in contact with bath @xmath6 .",
    "when we alternate the two baths in a cycle of four steps , @xmath60 , the system , after a certain number of cycles , reaches a regime where the internal energy and the mean velocity are periodic in time . in this regime",
    "we can compute the amount of heat extracted from each bath and the total work done by the force .",
    "the analytical treatment is analogous to the one carried out for the games and it is based on a three - state markov chain .",
    "we shall not include here the details of the calculations but shall give some of the results that can be obtained . applying equation ( [ equation7 ] ) to the first two steps of the cycle we compute the energy @xmath61 transferred from bath @xmath2 to the system , which is positive if @xmath49 .",
    "however , when we apply the same equation to the last two steps of the cycle we obtain a negative energy @xmath62 , and , if @xmath36 is weak enough , we obtain a negative @xmath63 .",
    "these results tell us that the system extracts energy from the hot bath , dissipates part of this energy towards the cold bath and uses what remains of it to do work against the external force .",
    "the efficiency of the thermal engine is    @xmath64    which is positive and less than 1 .    in figure [ force ]",
    "we plot the engine efficiency as a function of the external force @xmath36 .",
    "when the force is zero the efficiency is zero because the engine does not do any work and there is an irreversible heat transfer from the hot source to the cold one .",
    "note that this holds even though in this case there exists a current of particles .",
    "for sufficiently strong forces the efficiency is once again zero .",
    "the reason is that the particles can not move against strong forces . on the other hand , there exists a force for which the particle is , on the average , at rest and does not do work , while there still exists heat transfer from the hot bath to the cold one .",
    "as it can be seen , the engine always works irreversibly , so it can never attain the efficiency of the carnot engine .",
    "this is a common fact in the majority of brownian motors @xcite ( an exception are the reversible ratchets @xcite , whose efficiencies can be arbitrarily close to carnot s @xcite ) , including the feynman ratchet @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that feynman did not notice the intrinsic irreversibility of his thermal engine and went on to show that under a certain hypothesis that the engine could attain the carnot efficiency .",
    "it has recently been shown that such hypotheses are incorrect @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ efficiency ] we show the engine s efficiency for several temperatures @xmath44 keeping fixed the temperature @xmath43 .",
    "observe that the carnot efficiency curve , @xmath65 , is well above all the curves plotted in figure [ efficiency ] .",
    "we have shown a physical application of the paradoxical games , namely , in brownian or molecular motors . the name",
    " molecular motor \" comes from biophysics where several forms of energy conversion within the cell are studied .",
    "for example , there arepumps \" capable of transporting ions from one side of a biological membrane to the other against the ion s electrochemical gradient @xcite ; molecules travelling through microtubules transporting diverse cellular material ; or molecules capable of  pulling off \" a filament and making up the muscular tissue @xcite .",
    "each one of these systems consists of a unique protein that changes its tri - dimensional configuration upon hydrolysis of atp molecules .",
    "the protein is different for each system considered ( kinesins in the transport through micro - channels , myosines in the muscular tissue ) , but all of them are motors capable of extracting the stored energy in the atp bonds and transform it into mechanical energy .",
    "all these transformations are carried out at a scale where the thermal fluctuations are unavoidable .",
    "for all this , we believe that in order to understand the energy - exchange processes at the cellular level a disposal of the authentic thermodynamics of brownian motors will be essential .",
    "this thermodynamics will have to be , as we have seen , one of irreversible processes wherein the thermal fluctuations play a relevant role .",
    "it will , also , have to be different from the so - called finite - time thermodynamics , since the latter studies irreversible motors but of macroscopic character .    in recent years",
    ", the first steps have been taken towards building up the theory of molecular motors .",
    "nevertheless , despite some work that shows general properties @xcite most of the results so far refer to concrete models @xcite that are too simple to represent the behaviour of molecular motors .",
    "finally , we would like to conclude by recalling that the paradoxical games may have applications in other contexts .",
    "the paradox shows that the result of alternating two stochastic dynamics is far from being the  sum \" or combination of the effects of each dynamic considered alone , and that could , in fact , be completely unexpected .",
    "this result should raise the interest in alternating dynamics in physical , biological and economics systems .",
    "a markov chain is a set of @xmath66 states and we consider a particle that jumps in from one state to another in a probabilistic way and in discrete time steps .",
    "the markov chain is defined by the matrix    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the particle transition probability from state @xmath39 to the state @xmath42 .",
    "contrary to the usual matrix notation we shall use @xmath39 as the column index and @xmath42 as the row index .",
    "it can be readily checked that all the matrix elements are real numbers between @xmath13 and @xmath2 and that the entries of every column add up to @xmath2 .",
    "let us call @xmath69 the probability that the particle is in the state @xmath39 in time @xmath4 .",
    "the probability to find the particle in the state @xmath39 at time @xmath70 is equal to the probability that the particle jumps , in the step @xmath71 , from any other state @xmath42 ( including the case @xmath72 ) , that is    @xmath73    hence the distribution of probability @xmath74 satisfies the following evolution equation    @xmath75    the distribution @xmath76 tends , at large @xmath4 , to a stationary distribution , @xmath77 , that satisfies equation ( [ equation14 ] )    @xmath78    that is , @xmath79 is the eigenvector of the matrix @xmath80 with eigenvalue @xmath2 .",
    "the stationary distribution tells us , in the limit of long times , what are the probabilities of the particle being in the different states @xmath81 .    game b consists of a markov chain of three states , namely , @xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "the matrix @xmath80 is    @xmath82    notice that the elements of every column add up to @xmath2 .",
    "the stationary probability distribution is    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is a normalization constant .",
    "finally , a similar analysis holds for the random combination of games a and b upon substituting @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 . from this stationary probability distribution",
    "@xmath77 it is easy to compute the probability of winning in a particular run , as we have done in the main text .",
    "let us suppose we have a physical system that can be in any of the states @xmath81 with energy @xmath40 .",
    "what are the transition probabilities @xmath68 that govern the probabilistic evolution of the system when this is in contact with with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath38 ?        where @xmath84 is a normalized constant and @xmath90 , with @xmath91 the boltzmann constant",
    ". consequently , the transition matrix @xmath80 has to be such that it has the distribution @xmath79 , given by ( [ equation17 ] ) , as its eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath2 .",
    "an even more particular case is the metropolis algorithm wherein the transition probabilities are given by the following rule , for @xmath93 : or @xmath39 and @xmath42 are not connected , in which case @xmath94 , or they are connected , so that      where @xmath96 is chosen so that all the transition probabilities are between @xmath13 and @xmath2 ( it often is the coordination number , i.e. the number of states connected to the state @xmath39 ) finally , the transition probability from @xmath39 to itself is        we shall use the metropolis algorithm in this article to model a particle in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "notice also that in equation ( [ equation19 ] ) there is a non - zero probability that the particle increases its energy .",
    "these transitions are the result of thermal fluctuations where the thermal bath gives energy to the particle .",
