    "blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies are dwarf irregular systems that are currently experiencing a burst of star formation .",
    "their appearance is dominated by the starburst , which appears compact and blue , hence their name .",
    "their spectra show all the characteristics of hii  regions , which has led many bcds to be classified as hii  galaxies ( although , in general , not all hii  galaxies are necessary dwarf systems ) . at their current star formation rates ( sfrs )",
    ", these systems would exhaust their total available gas in considerably less than a hubble time ; for this reason , it is generally accepted that their star formation must be episodic .",
    "gas  rich dwarf galaxies play an important role in our attempts to understand galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "bcds show low metallicities which suggests that they are chemically unevolved systems .",
    "they are more metal ",
    "deficient than the solar neighborhood by factors between three and twenty @xcite , with a few objects such as izw18 @xcite and sbs0335052 ( melnick , heydari ",
    "malayeri , & leisy 1992 ) reaching metallicities as low as @xmath1 .",
    "this said , most bcds do not seem to be young objects in the sense that they are undergoing their first episode of star formation .",
    "many reveal older stellar populations underlying the bright young stars produced in the current bursts @xcite .",
    "this poses some interesting questions regarding the production and possible loss of heavy elements .",
    "recent x  ray observations with the _ chandra x  ray observatory _ seem to indicate that in starbursting dwarf galaxies such as ngc1569 and ngc3077 ( martin , kobulnicky , & heckman 2002 ; ott , martin , & walter 2003 ) , blow  out of material into the halo occurs that will remove the products of nucleosynthesis in stars more massive than 8@xmath2  and disperse those across a larger volume .",
    "numerical simulations have suggested that in extreme cases blow  away can occur , which removes these products from the galaxy proper and enriches the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "it is not clear what causes a bcd to initiate a burst or episode of star formation , and several mechanisms have been proposed , ranging from internal instabilities to external ( especially tidal ) triggers .",
    "reports that some bcds are isolated systems ( e.g. , van zee , skillman , & salzer ( 1998 ) , who observed four such objects in hi ) suggests that interactions may not be the only explanation . but other studies ( e.g. , taylor et al .",
    "1994 ; taylor 1997 ; walter et al . 1997 ; pustilnik et al .",
    "2001b , and references therein ) have shown that the presence of close companions producing tidal interactions may be a sufficient condition to explain bcd bursts .",
    "furthermore , recent studies ( see e.g. , noeske et al .",
    "2001 ) of large samples of star  forming dwarf galaxies that look for faint companions give additional support to the hypothesis of interaction  induced star formation in bcds .",
    "most studies to date have focused , broadly speaking , on the optical characteristics of bcds , with several incorporating hi  observations of sufficiently high spatial resolution to resolve the objects under study . despite the fact that gas has to pass through a molecular phase for star formation to commence ,",
    "only very few authors have reported high  resolution ( interferometric ) maps of molecular gas in bcds .",
    "detecting co in dwarf galaxies has proved to be quite a challenge , a fact that is frequently attributed to the low metallicity in these objects ( gondhalekar et al .",

    "standard vla calibration and imaging procedures were applied , using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips , see van  moorsel , kemball & greisen ( 1996 ) for an up  to  date description ) .",
    "data cubes were produced with robust weighting @xcite in order to maximize sensitivity while preserving as high a spatial resolution as possible . in order to define the extent of the hi  emission , we initially averaged four line  free channels on either side of the band to create a first approximation of the continuum .",

    "a new continuum image was made using all channels deemed free from line emission .",
    "after continuum subtraction , the channels containing line emission were cleaned . in order to build moment maps from the data cubes we used a masking technique : for each cleaned cube with a beam of around 15@xmath9 , we applied a convolution to a beam approximately twice as large , i.e. , 30@xmath9 .",
    "the smoothed cubes were then clipped at a level of @xmath11 , and hi  emission was identified via visual inspection on the basis of spatial continuity in neighboring channel maps . a conditional transfer ( or _ mask _ ) was applied to the original cleaned cube using the blanked , smoothed data . as a last step hisurface brightness maps and velocity fields were created .",

    "comparison of our hi  detection with published single  dish data yields the following results .",
    "@xcite observed haro2 with the 300ft green bank telescope , which had a 10.8@xmath0  beam . from examining their published spectra",
    ", we deduce a peak flux of 34mjy and a line width at 50% of the peak of @xmath31  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the authors publish a line width at 20% of the peak of @xmath32  km  s@xmath8  and a total himass of 5.2@xmath1010@xmath33@xmath2  ( using a distance of 21mpc ) .",
    "if we adjust their distance to the one used throughout this paper ( 19.5mpc ) , the total hi  mass is @xmath34@xmath2 . in a more recent study with the effelsberg 100m telescope , which gives a 9.3@xmath0  beam , huchtmeier , sage , & henkel ( 1995 ) report @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and a peak flux of @xmath37mjy .",
    "these authors point out that their observations of haro2 may suffer from confusion with a close companion located 4.7@xmath0  to the east ( see also nilson 1973 ) .",
    "we inspected our data cube around the position of the putative companion but detected no hi  emission .",
    "it is therefore justified to use their single  dish data to derive an hi  mass for haro2 , which ( integrating the published spectra by hand ) comes out to be @xmath38@xmath2 .",
    "the two single  dish results agree with each other within their respective uncertainties .",
    "the single  dish linewidths also agree with the value we determine from our interferometric data , but the latter fall short as far as the integrated flux is concerned : the vla recovers an hi  mass of order @xmath39@xmath2 , i.e. , only @xmath40 of the single  dish mass ( see table [ tab - hiparm ] ) .",
    "we are aware of the fact that cleaned maps do not always yield accurate integrated fluxes , especially when the hidistribution in the channel maps is extended on scales comparable to or larger than @xmath41 of the primary beam ( see , e.g. , jrster & van moorsel 1995 ) . in the case of haro2",
    ", whose hi  emission has an extent of order @xmath42 , or less than 1/15th of the primary beam , we discard this as a possible explanation .",
    "instead , we postulate that the vla maps only reveal the `` tip of the iceberg '' and that the galaxy contains extended , low surface brightness gas that is mostly missed by the interferometer .",
    "figure  2 shows the integrated spectrum from our vla data .",
    "this profile is in very good agreement with that obtained by @xcite in terms of both the velocity width and the slight asymmetry towards lower velocity side , where a bump appears near 1420  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "we do not confirm the secondary peak seen by @xcite at 1550  km  s@xmath8 ; this feature was also not detected by @xcite at effelsberg . in figure  2",
    "it is also clear that we are missing part of the extended emission of the galaxy .",
    "figure  3 is a map at @xmath43 resolution of the hisurface brightness in haro2 superposed on an optical dss image in grey scale .",
    "it appears elongated in a southeast  northwest direction , much like what can be seen in the channel maps . the hi  disk dimensions are @xmath44 ( equivalent to @xmath45 at the distance of haro2 ) , at a level of @xmath46@xmath6 .",
    "these are estimated along the optical major and minor axis of the galaxy , respectively , as shown by the two lines drawn in figure  3 , but were measured from a smoothed hi  map that is not shown in this work .",
    "the hi  disk orientation roughly coincides with the @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) optical disk , whose major axis has a position angle of approximately 135@xmath49 .",
    "at least three features appear to be unresolved hi  clouds with optical counterparts : one to the west of haro2 , ( labeled a , at @xmath50 , @xmath51=+54@xmath4924@xmath000@xmath9 ) , one to the east ( labeled b , at @xmath52 , @xmath51=+54@xmath4924@xmath000@xmath9 ) , and one to the northeast ( labeled c , at @xmath52 , @xmath51=+54@xmath4924@xmath043@xmath9 ) .",
    "these hi  concentrations may either be dynamically distinct structures , or represent only the local peaks of a smooth extended hi  component that the vla otherwise resolves out . in either case , although each of the peaks is detected in at least two velocity channels , more sensitive observations will be needed to confirm their reality .",
    "figure  4 presents the hi  velocity field of haro2 and reveals the galaxy s complex kinematics .",
    "there is virtually no velocity gradient visible along the major axis defined by the optical light and hidistribution ; a cursory inspection of the channel maps ( figure  1 ) already hints at this behavior .",
    "a clear gradient is seen at roughly right angles to the major axis , with only a weak suggestion of rotation about the minor axis to the east .",
    "the low velocity resolution of our observations unfortunately prevent us from confirming this latter feature . in general",
    ", the kinematics of haro2 inferred from its hi  emission is consistent with the analysis of the inner @xmath53 by @xcite using the h@xmath54 emission line .",
    "figure  5 shows the co(10 ) total intensity map for haro2 , integrated over twelve channels from 1378 to @xmath55 lsr .",
    "we detect a clear arclike feature extending from southeast to northwest , containing several distinct emission peaks . taken together , these cover the same area on the sky as that in which vigorous star formation is seen in the optical , as the overlay in figure  6 shows .",
    "there appears to be an additional concentration of gas @xmath56 to the south , and a possible component just as far to the northwest ( labeled s and nw in figure  5 ) ; these clouds are also seen in independent data obtained with the iram plateau de bure interferometer by @xcite .",
    "after clipping the data cube at the @xmath57 level , we corrected for the primary beam response and measured the galaxy s total co(10 ) flux to be @xmath58 . excluding the outlying concentrations of gas",
    ", we find @xmath59 . assuming a galactic co ",
    "to@xmath60 conversion factor of @xmath61 @xcite , we estimate the total molecular hydrogen masses following sanders , scoville , & soifer ( 1991 ) : @xmath62 the observed line fluxes then imply @xmath63 and @xmath64 for all of haro2 and for its central regions , respectively .",
    "multiplying by an additional factor of 1.36 to account for helium will give the total masses of gas associated with the co  emitting structures .",
    "use of a metallicity ",
    "dependent @xmath65 ( wilson 1995 ; arimoto , sofue , & tsujimoto 1996 ) would elevate these gas masses by an additional factor of 34 for haro2 s @xmath66 . however , more recent studies of m33 @xcite and metal  poor dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , walter et al . 2004 , in preparation ) suggest that @xmath65 does not depend on metallicity .",
    "moreover , the results of the study of molecular gas in haro2 by @xcite validates the use of a nearly galactic conversion factor to estimate @xmath67 in this particular system .",
    "since interferometric data are insensitive to emission which is smoothly distributed on scales of order that of the primary beam , we wish to estimate the fraction of the total line flux our map recovers .",
    "we have therefore corrected the entire data cube for the primary beam response , convolved it to the half ",
    "power beamwidths of @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the nrao 12 m and iram 30 m telescopes , and measured the integrated intensities of our convolved data at the pointing centers used for published single  dish observations .",
    "we find we have recovered @xmath70 of the the total co(10 ) emission seen by @xcite in their @xmath68 beam , and a mean ( for four separate pointings ) of @xmath71 of the flux seen by @xcite and @xcite in their @xmath69 beams .",
    "we make no attempt to correct for this undetected flux in what follows .    a comparison between the co ( greyscale ) and hi  ( contours , as in figure  3 ) is shown in figure  7 , revealing interesting common features .",
    "the lower resolution obtained for the hi  relative to the co prevents a detailed comparison in the very center of haro2 where the co displays a large degree of structure . in spite of this limitation ,",
    "we confirm that the arc  like co feature follows a distribution along the same ( southeast  northwest ) direction as the hi ; both are coincident with the major axis of the galaxy seen in blue light .",
    "the co is more concentrated , with a linear size smaller than the stellar component , whereas the hiappears more extended . with the exception of the southeast tail ,",
    "the brightest co regions are projected onto the innermost hi  contour where star formation is observed to be most active ( see also section [ s - disc ] ) .",
    "a more detailed comparison is possible between the co map and the @xmath72 resolution _ rosat _ hri x  ray image published by summers , stevens , & strickland ( 2001 ) .",
    "figure  8 shows an overlay of co contours on a greyscale representation of the x  ray emission .",
    "given that residual _",
    "rosat _ pointing errors ( which dominate the uncertainty in the relative astrometry of these two images ) can be as large as @xmath73 , the agreement in the location and spatial extent of the highest surface brightness structures at both wavelengths ( as well as in the optical ; see figure  6 ) is quite good . in particular , there is a tantalizing alignment between the co arc and the lower of the two x  ray ridges defining a tilted `` v '' morphology in the central part of the hri image .",
    "this coincidence can be explained if part of the x  ray emission is produced by shock  heated gas at the interface between an expanding superbubble and a collection of dense molecular clouds .",
    "the comparable spatial extent of @xmath74 emission in haro2 @xcite and evidence for an expanding shell in ionized gas kinematics @xcite offers further support for this picture .",
    "alternatively , the x  ray emission could be a consequence of the active star formation that is taking place currently and the associated detonation of core  collapse supernovae . the formation of high mass x ",
    "ray binaries was deemed less likely by @xcite , based on their hardness ratio as compared to that of the extended emission seen in haro2 .",
    "higher resolution x  ray observations with instruments like _ xmm - newton _ or _ chandra _ will be needed to determine conclusively the nature of the x  ray emission and its relation to the ionized , atomic , and molecular ism .",
    "figure  9 shows the channel maps for the co(10 ) line in haro2 , obtained after smoothing down the data from the original @xmath75 resolution by a factor of three .",
    "although the signal  to  noise for many of the features is rather meager , it is clear that the kinematics of the molecular gas is quite complex .",
    "the central arc  like feature in the integrated intensity map ( figure  5 ) does not appear to have a coherent velocity structure .",
    "moreover , the spatially outlying structures do not seem to be moving at the higher relative velocities expected in the case of ordered rotation ( e.g. , the southeast component appears mainly in the @xmath76 channel ) . as on the larger spatial scales traced by hi ,",
    "the gas kinematics in the nucleus of haro2 are not those of a quiescent system .",
    "figure  10 shows the hi  channel maps for haro4 . despite the fact that it is almost twice as close as haro2 ,",
    "its hi  distribution is only marginally resolved at our 14@xmath9  resolution ( equivalent to @xmath70.5kpc ) .",
    "the integrated hi  map superposed on an optical dss image is shown in figure  11 .",
    "this map confirms the highly compact nature of the hi  distribution , even though it is still almost three times more extended than the stellar component ( see table [ tab - ratios ] ) .",
    "no clear rotation pattern is detected for this galaxy , and higher  resolution vla observations are required to understand the kinematics of this object in more detail .",
    "the hicontent we derive for this galaxy ( @xmath77@xmath78@xmath2 ) agrees with the single  dish value reported by @xcite , confirming that no hi  emission is missed by the vla .    as mentioned in section [ ss - coobs ] , no co(21 ) emission",
    "was detected from haro4 . from the per  channel rms of 9mk ( @xmath79 ) ,",
    "the corresponding conversion factor @xmath80 for the cso at 230ghz @xcite , and an assumed velocity width of @xmath81 ( matching the hi  fwhm ) , we derive a @xmath17 upper limit on the integrated co(21 ) flux from haro4 of @xmath82 . if the co(21)/co(10 ) intensity ratio is @xmath83 in temperature units , as is the case for the two bcds ( haro2 and mrk297 ) mapped by @xcite , then we would expect the co(10 ) line flux from haro4 to be @xmath84 .",
    "equation [ e - mh2 ] then implies that haro4 has a molecular hydrogen mass @xmath85 .",
    "correction of @xmath65 for the possible dependence on metallicity according to the prescriptions of @xcite and @xcite could increase this upper limit on @xmath67 by factors of 8 and 16 , respectively .    projected some 22@xmath0  sw of haro4 ,",
    "the neighboring spiral galay haro26 is well",
    " resolved by the vla beam and spans a much larger range in velocity .",

    "the total hi  surface brightness map presented in figure  14 shows the integrated hi  emission of haro26 superposed on a dss image .",
    "as is common , the hi  extends well beyond the optical image , in this case by about a factor of 1.5 ( see table [ tab - ratios ] ) .",
    "we measure a total hi  flux for haro26 of 40  jy  km  s@xmath8 , in good agreement with previous hi  line observations .",
    "@xcite observed this galaxy with the 91m nrao telescope and obtained an hi  flux of 48.3  jy  km  s@xmath8 , very close to the @xmath86 reported by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite observed this galaxy with the vla and reported an hi  mass of @xmath87@xmath2  ( scaled to the our assumed distance of 7.9mpc ) , only 15% larger than the value of @xmath88@xmath2  that we report in this work ( see table [ tab - hiparm ] ) .",

    "2001 ) , leading those authors to classify haro2 as a dwarf _",
    "elliptical_. haro 2 has a small to  optical diameter ratio , @xmath92 , whereas the hi  distributions of most bcds are usually considerably larger than their optical disks ( @xmath93 : taylor et al .",
    "1994 ; van  zee et al . 1998 ; van  zee , salzer , & skillman 2001 ) .",
    "the hi  content of haro2 is normal relative to other bcds , in contrast to its @xmath94 ratio ( see table  [ tab - ratios ] ) , which is at the low end for bcds @xcite . of the sample studied by @xcite ,",
    "haro2 is most similar to um38 and mrk324 , two other dwarf ellipticals @xcite with comparable atomic gas properties .",
    "um465 resembles haro2 in that it is a dwarf elliptical detected in both co and hi  emission , although it has a somewhat smaller hi  mass and somewhat larger metallicity @xcite .",
    "while haro2 does resemble a bcd in terms of its optical morphology and gas content , it is almost unique in the kinematics of its neutral atomic and molecular gas . whereas in disk  dominated systems the kinematic and isophotal major axes are aligned , in the case of haro2 they are nearly perpendicular .",
    "one of the few dwarf galaxies with equally pathological kinematics is ngc5253 , whose own molecular and atomic gas components also appear to be predominantly rotating about the galaxy s major axis @xcite . this configuration has been postulated to result from a tidal interaction , or from the accretion of gas from a formerly gas  rich ( now stripped ) companion .",
    "its kinematic complexity , together with the presence of a dust lane ( like that seen in haro2 : m \" ollenhoff , hummel , & bender 1992 ) , suggest ngc5253 may be a dwarf version of a giant , post  interaction , dust lane elliptical @xcite . in the context of this interaction scenario ,",
    "some of the similarities and differences between haro2 and ngc5253 deserve special attention .    in terms of star formation",
    ", ngc5253 appears to be undergoing a burst that is markedly younger and more intense than that in haro2 . while the youngest stars in haro2 have ages @xmath95 ( fanelli , oconnell , & thuan 1988 ) , population synthesis fits to star clusters in ngc5253 suggest ages in the 18myr range @xcite , and its extremely luminous and deeply embedded `` supernebula '' ( turner , beck , & ho 2000 ; gorjian , turner , & beck 2001 ; turner et al .",
    "2003 ) must be younger still .",
    "haro2 s older burst age is also indicated by its lower millimeter / centimeter continuum flux ratio . in particular , our @xmath17 upper limit of 2.3mjy on 112ghz emission from haro2 ( see section [ ss - coobs ] above )",
    "implies that no more than @xmath96 of its 24.6mjy observed at 1.4ghz can be due to optically thin free  free emission ( assuming a spectral index @xmath97 ) .",
    "virtually all of the 1.4ghz flux density from ngc5253 , on the other hand , is thermal ( turner , ho , & beck 1998 ; meier et al .",
    "2002 ) . finally , the star formation efficiency in ngc5253 is considerably higher , with its @xmath98 @xcite exceeding the more modest @xmath99 we infer for haro2 ( see section [ ss - sf ] below ) .",
    "it is tempting to associate the older , less vigorous starburst in haro2 with a dynamical disturbance that occurred longer in the past than the one currently afflicting ngc5253 .",
    "several lines of evidence indeed favor this interpretation . first , much of the molecular gas in the vicinity of ngc5253 appears still to be falling inward and is not associated with the regions of most intense star formation @xcite .",
    "haro2 , in contrast , has a distribution whose spatial extent broadly matches that of its star formation as traced by @xmath74 , x  ray , and optical continuum emission ; this agreement suggests that haro2 s molecular component has finished coalescing towards the bottom of its potential well .",
    "second , the disagreement between the position angles of the hi  and optical disks in ngc5253 in fact , they are nearly perpendicular on the sky represents a level of disturbance not seen in haro2 , where the hi  follows the optical disk quite well .",
    "third , we recall from section [ ss - hiobs ] that our vla data failed to recover about half of the hi  emission detected in single  dish observations of haro2 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "diffuse , extended emission could very well surround the galaxy on @xmath100 scales , having accumulated there in the same way that late infall in more massive post ",
    "interaction systems can build regular hi  disks @xcite .",
    "considering all of the above evidence , we conclude that haro2 is most likely a somewhat older cousin of ngc5253 a dwarf elliptical galaxy that has recently captured gas in a close interaction or merger with an initially gas  rich companion . for haro2 ,",
    "an obvious candidate donor is the putative companion lying 4.7@xmath0  to the east @xcite , whose non  detection in hi  by those authors could be explained if it lost all its gas in the interaction .",
    "if at the same redshift , its projected separation from haro2 would be a mere 27kpc ; however , there is no redshift estimate for this object , and the real distance which separates it from haro2 remains uncertain .",
    "alternatively , @xcite propose the galaxy ugc5676 as the trigger of the burst of star formation .",
    "this object lies much further away in projection , some 36@xmath0  ( @xmath101 ) northeast of haro2 , but is known to share roughly the same redshift .",
    "both neighbors are fainter than haro2 ( by 3 and 1.6 magnitudes , respectively ) and presumably less massive as well , consistent with our assumption that one of them would have lost its gas mass to haro2 rather than the other way around . in view of the mass  metallicity relation for dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , bender , burstein , & faber 1992 ) , haro2 should have received an infusion of less enriched gas from its less massive companion .",
    "this would tend to have left haro2 with a lower metallicity in its interstellar medium than in its stars , although exactly how much lower is difficult to predict without knowing what fraction of its gas mass originated elsewhere .",
    "we note that the possibility of tidal interaction with more than one object at different times should also not be ruled out .    in the `` passing encounter ''",
    "scenario depicted above and even if haro2 is actually in the final stages of a merger with a gas  rich dwarf gas would have been captured at a random angle with respect to the major axis of haro2 , and would have since settled into a relatively stable orbit encircling the galaxy s long axis .",
    "the fraction of gas settling further into the gravitational potential of haro2 would accumulate and reach densities high enough for molecules to form .",
    "molecular gas spiralling inward would naturally shock , leading to the current burst of star formation we are witnessing .    even if the hi  gas is of relatively recent acquisition , its motion is by now dominated by the gravitational potential of haro2 , any plausible donor having passed perigalacticon and no longer exerting any tidal pull .",
    "if we assume that the object 27kpc to the east was the source of the accreted gas , and if we take as an order of magnitude estimate a relative velocity between the two objects of 150  km  s@xmath8  ( a reasonable upper limit , according to taylor et al .",
    "1994 ) , @xmath102 have elapsed since closest approach , i.e. , a few revolutions of the captured gas in the potential of haro2 .",
    "it is therefore valid , as a first approximation , to assume for dynamical mass estimates that the gas is moving in roughly circular orbits .",
    "we recall that the hi  and co velocity fields show that any rotation is within a plane more or less perpendicular to the optical major axis . given that no value for the inclination is known",
    ", we can only estimate a lower limit to the dynamical mass .",
    "the extent of the gas along the kinematical major axis is @xmath71.0@xmath0 .",
    "taking a distance to haro2 of 19.5mpc and a projected rotational velocity of 62.5  km  s@xmath8 , we find a value of @xmath103@xmath2  and an @xmath104/@xmath105 ratio @xmath106 .",
    "even when taking into account the fact that the dynamical mass estimate is a lower limit , for any reasonable @xmath107 ratio for the stars in haro2 there does nt seem to be a need to invoke any dark matter .",
    "this is contrary to what is generally seen in bcds which , if anything , are more dark matter dominated than large , spiral galaxies .",
    "our estimate of 180myr as the time of closest approach leaves ample time for the hi  to turn into @xmath3 . following the same arguments as given in @xcite , the time to transform 20% of atomic hydrogen into @xmath3 is @xmath108 years where @xmath109 is the hivolume density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a rough estimate of the latter can be made by taking the average of the hicolumn density across the area where co has been detected and assuming a line  of  sight thickness for the hi  of order 200pc . the hivolume density thus derived is @xmath110 , suggesting that the time needed to transform a substantial amount of atomic to molecular gas is less than @xmath111years , much shorter than the typical time for solar mass stars to form subsequently ( @xmath112myr ) .",
    "@xmath113 is an appropriate indicator for the timescale on which molecular gas forms in haro2 as most of the gas is still atomic .",
    "lower metallicities and hence lower dust content will decrease linearly the rate at which this occurs .    the prominent nuclear star formation in haro2 has been analyzed in the uv and optical by @xcite using _",
    "these authors find evidence for gas flowing away from the central hii  region at a velocity of 200  km  s@xmath8 , notably strong @xmath114 emission with a clear pcygni profile and a complex velocity structure ( see also legrand et al .",
    "the column density of neutral hydrogen in this outflowing gas is @xmath115 @xmath6 .",
    "this is only a small fraction of the column density measured in the vla map , which is of order @xmath116@xmath6 ( averaged over the central pixel at a spatial resolution of @xmath117kpc ) .",
    "the data are best explained by assuming that the central starburst has created an expanding supergiant shell measuring @xmath118kpc and expanding at 200  km  s@xmath8 . in this model ,",
    "the outflowing gas is predominantly ionized by the central star cluster , and the total mass involved in the outflow ( if distributed in a spherical shell immediately surrounding the hii  region ) is of order 10@xmath119@xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , the size of this proposed shell is too close to the resolution limit of the hi  observations for us to be able to detect its signature in our data cube .",
    "editor : place table [ tab - ratios ] here .",
    "haro4 , shown in figure  11 , appears to be highly centrally concentrated in both its hi  and optical light distributions .",
    "the hi  mass of this galaxy is low compared to that of most bcds previously observed in hi@xcite ; we estimate a lower limit for its dynamical mass of @xmath120@xmath2 .",
    "however , as no clear indications for rotation are seen , this should only be considered indicative . other parameters of haro4 are rather typical among bcds , such as its @xmath77/@xmath105 and @xmath121 ratios .",
    "@xcite find in haro4 a broad damped ly@xmath54  absorption profile centered at the wavelength corresponding to the redshift of the h@xmath54 emitting gas .",
    "they show that this occurs chiefly because the hi  gas is smooth and virtually static , as confirmed by the new vla observations , with respect to the ionized region where ly@xmath54 photons originate .",
    "for haro26 , the hi  map in figure  14 confirms the strong warping towards the northeast already observed in the optical @xcite and in hi@xcite . while the former authors find no nearby companion to explain the warp , @xcite suggest that the emission extending towards the north  east may in fact be a separate object .",
    "we find no evidence to support this scenario , however , as our velocity field in the northeast extension appears to be continuous with that of the main galaxy . from the channel maps",
    "( figure  12 ) and the zeroth and first moment maps ( figures  14 and 16 ) , we speculate instead that a long  range interaction with haro4 is responsible for the warp , with haro4 pulling the near side of the disk of haro26 towards it .",
    "a similar case of a tidal interaction between the bcd sbs0335052 and the galaxy ngc1376 was proposed by @xcite to explain the burst of star formation in the former .",
    "the projected separation between the latter two galaxies is about 150kpc , almost three times the projected distance between haro4 and haro26 .",
    "we note that the radio continuum emission of haro26 shown in figure  17 follows the same warp seen in hi .",
    "the intensities of the radio continuum blobs in the south and the northeast warp reach @xmath122 .",
    "star formation is thought to occur whenever the local gas density exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "this can be an empirical level , as proposed by @xcite , who found that star formation in dwarf irregulars occurs for densities above @xmath123@xmath6 .",
    "alternatively , the local gas density can cause clouds to become gravitationally unstable @xcite .",
    "@xcite found in their sample that this threshold was equivalent to a column density of hi  of 10@xmath124@xmath6 .",
    "our spatial resolution is insufficient to independently calculate the threshold value for haro2 or haro4 .",
    "qualitatively , star formation activity is seen in our maps above @xmath125@xmath6 , and the regions of highest hicolumn density coincide with the galaxies seen in the optical .",
    "it is worth noting that the co in haro2 closely follows the highest hi  concentration , indicating that star formation is likely restricted to the very central regions as reported by @xcite .",
    "the radio continuum also traces the recent star formation activity . in the case of haro2 ,",
    "the radio continuum distribution ( obtained as a byproduct of the 21 cm spectral line observations ) was only marginally resolved and rather featureless .",
    "our 20 cm radio continuum flux ( see table [ tab - hiparm ] ) compares reasonably well with the 20mjy reported by @xcite , who show a much higher resolution map than ours ( vla a configuration ) restricted to a zone smaller than the optical galaxy .    although haro2 is metal  poor , its hii  region metallicity at @xmath126 is not extremely low .",
    "this implies that we are not observing its first burst of star formation and supports the suggestion that whereas the youngest burst began less than 10 myr ago , it was preceded by other bursts @xcite . we can estimate the current rate of formation of massive ( @xmath127 ) stars using the relations of @xcite .",
    "in fact , we can use three independent sfr indicators and check if they are mutually consistent .    based on the 1.4ghz continuum luminosity , and assuming the radio continuum is of non  thermal origin ( as argued in section [ ss - disc - h2 ] ) , we obtain from condon s equation ( 21 ) @xmath128 yielding @xmath129 for haro2 if we use @xmath130 from table [ tab - hiparm ] . using the @xmath74 luminosity , condon s equation ( 22 ) states",

    ", we estimate @xmath140 and @xmath141 . ]",
    "the good agreement between these three estimates suggests that dust does not severely attenuate haro2 s observed @xmath74 luminosity ( at least along our line of sight ) .",
    "this favorable geometry , together with the disordered co(10 ) velocity field in the inner starbursting region , may explain why haro2 shows a strong @xmath142 emission line with a p  cygni profile as reported by @xcite and seen in new _",
    "hst_/stis data @xcite .",
    "as we emphasized above , the absence of similar @xmath143 emission from haro4 in the same study may be in part related to that galaxy s much less disturbed velocity field , which renders @xmath143 photons less able to avoid resonant scattering and escape the galaxy .",
    "vla hi  observations of haro2 reveal emission extending over a 7.9kpc @xmath10 4.0kpc area , roughly coinciding with the optical galaxy ( 5.7kpc @xmath10 5.1kpc ) in extent and orientation .",
    "the hi  mass we see in our interferometric data is @xmath144@xmath2 ; a single dish spectrum suggests than that the object is embedded in a smooth , extended hi  halo containing an additional @xmath145@xmath2  of atomic gas .",
    "the @xmath77/@xmath105 ratio is about 0.1 in solar units .",
    "surprisingly , the kinematical major axis lies almost perpendicular to the optical ( photometric ) major axis .",
    "this strongly suggest an external source for the hi  gas .",
    "the picture emerging from our study is that of haro2 being a dwarf elliptical galaxy ( as already postulated by @xcite on the basis of their optical photometry ) , which has acquired in an interaction or recent merger a substantial amount of gas .",
    "assuming that this gas has settled into regular orbits we derive a dynamical mass of @xmath146@xmath2  and an @xmath104/@xmath105 ratio of 1.0 . as we have no independent handle on the inclination ,",
    "the estimate of the dynamical mass is a lower limit and could be larger by a factor of a few .",

    "haro4 seems to be interacting with the nearby spiral galaxy haro26 (= ngc  3510 ) , the latter object showing a pronounced warp in the direction of the bcd .",
    "our results provide additional proof that interactions with neighboring galaxies are responsible for the onset of the current episodes of star formation in bcds .",
    "although the two galaxies under consideration lie in relatively low ",
    "density environments , we conclude that a major accretion event or merger can account for the nuclear starburst in haro2 as well as for its peculiar kinematics , whereas a more transient encounter between haro4 and the neighboring spiral haro26 could explain both the star formation in the former and the pronounced warp in the latter .",

    "<S> the hi  data of haro2 reveal that the kinematical major axis lies perpendicular to the photometric major axis , indicating that the atomic hydrogen rotates about the major axis of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms earlier indications based on ccd photometry that haro2 is a dust  </S>",
    "<S> lane de rather than a dirr . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the present neutral and molecular ism configuration is due to recent gas accretion or a merger . </S>",
    "<S> the hi  distribution and dynamics of haro4 and the neighboring spiral haro26 suggest that they are currently undergoing a tidal interaction , reinforcing the notion that interactions play an important role in triggering the star formation witnessed in blue compact galaxies . </S>"
