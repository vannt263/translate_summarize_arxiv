    "galaxy members in a cluster of galaxies are embedded in a hot diffuse intra - cluster medium ( icm ) emitting x - rays , and suffering various environmental effects .",
    "since virgo is one of the nearest clusters , we can study the environmental effects there in greatest detail .",
    "observation in the 21 cm line show that the hi gas is deficient for galaxies near the center of the virgo cluster ( e.g. , cayatte et al .",
    "this is interpreted as being a result of ram pressure stripping .",
    "@xcite simulated the ram pressure effect by a numerical calculation and matched well the observed distortion of the hi disk due to the ram pressure .",
    "@xcite observed the virgo spiral galaxies in the co@xmath410 ) line using the 14 m telescope of the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) and found that the molecular gas content appears to be normal , even in hi deficient galaxies .",
    "they reported that hi - deficient galaxies have a high ratio of co flux to hi flux .",
    "whether a galaxy suffers environmental effects or not , the inner disk of a spiral galaxy is dominated by molecular gas , because in general the inner disk is originally dominated by molecular gas .",
    "therefore , it has not been clarified whether the inner disk is affected by environmental effects or not .",
    "we can enumerate three possibilities for the physical condition of the inner disk : ( 1 ) ram pressure stripping occurs only in the outer hi disk , and the inner disk suffers no environmental effect , ( 2 ) ram pressure stripping occurs in the inner disk as well as the outer disk , but only hi gas is selectively stripped , ( 3 ) the ism pressure of the inner disk increases due to external pressures , and molecular gas formation is enhanced .",
    "the molecular gas can be dominant in the inner disk in any of these three possibilities .    in order to develop our understanding of the physical condition of the gas in inner disks of cluster spiral galaxies",
    ", we must pay attention to the molecular fraction ( @xmath0 ; ratio of molecular to total gas surface density ) . in the first possibility",
    ", there would be no difference in the molecular fraction , @xmath0 , in the inner disk between cluster and field galaxies .",
    "however , the @xmath0 of cluster galaxies would be larger than that of field galaxies in the second and third possibilities .    in this paper",
    ", we show results of the highest resolution single - dish observations in the co line of five virgo cluster galaxies achieved with the nobeyama 45 m telescope equipped with a multi - beam receiver , bears .",
    "we also compare the co data with hi data with almost the same resolution obtained with the very large array ( vla ) c and d - configurations .",
    "these data sets enable us to investigate the molecular fraction at each point of the spiral galaxies with a fine scale , while earlier research has dealt with the total amounts of hi and co ( h@xmath3 ) gases in galaxies . based on clues from @xmath0 ,",
    "we quantitatively discuss the physical condition of the gas disks in terms of ( 1 ) hi stripping , ( 2 ) external pressure due to the icm or ram pressure , ( 3 ) intrinsic metallicity in a galaxy , and ( 4 ) the uv field of a galaxy .",
    "the distance of the virgo cluster is taken to be 16.1 mpc @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1co@xmath2 observations of the virgo cluster spirals were made from 2002 december to 2004 april with the nobeyama 45 m radio telescope .",
    "the half - power beam - width was @xmath5 ( 1.2 kpc at the virgo cluster ) at 115 ghz .",
    "we used a focal plane array receiver , bears ( sis 25-beam array receiver system ) , which consisted - of 25 beams ( @xmath6 ) and was operated in the double - side - band ( dsb ) mode @xcite .",
    "the separation between the beams was @xmath7 .",
    "twenty - five digital auto - correlators with a 500 khz resolution ( 1.3 km s@xmath8 at 115 ghz ) and a 512 mhz coverage ( 1332 km s@xmath8 ) @xcite were used as spectrometers .",
    "calibration of the line intensity was made with an absorbing chopper wheel in front of the receiver , which yielded the antenna temperature @xmath9 corrected for the atmospheric and antenna ohmic losses . since the scale of the intensity varies with the beams , mainly due to the difference of the side band ratio between the upper side band ( usb ) and the lower side band ( lsb ) , we scaled the observed dsb intensity to the ssb ( single side band ) intensity using scaling factors that were determined by comparing the co intensities of ngc 7538 measured with bears and a single - beam ssb receiver , sis100 .",
    "the main beam efficiency of the telescope was @xmath10 at 115 ghz , and the intensity given in this paper is the main beam brightness temperature , defined by @xmath11 .",
    "we mapped five virgo galaxies with a grid spacing of @xmath12 .",
    "the number of total observed points for each galaxy was 576 and the mapped area was @xmath13 , except for ngc 4254 and ngc 4569 , whose number of observed points was 1056 and the area was @xmath14 .",
    "the observations were made in the position - switching mode with an off - position at an offset of @xmath15 from the centers of the galaxies in azimuth .",
    "the typical rms noise of the main beam brightness temperature was @xmath16 k per velocity channel .",
    "pointing of the antenna was calibrated by observing the continuum point source 3c273 at 43 ghz , and its typical error was less than @xmath17 ( peak value ) .",
    "our observed samples were selected out of the galaxies in @xcite , and the observing parameters are listed in table 1 .     table 1     to compare with the distribution of co , we used the hi data of the target galaxies mapped with the vla .",
    "the hi data were adopted from @xcite for ngc 4254 , from @xcite for ngc 4402 , ngc 4569 , and ngc 4579 , and from @xcite for ngc 4654 .",
    "the spatial resolution of the hi maps was about @xmath18 , which is close to that of our co maps .",

    "the hi gas in ngc 4254 and ngc 4654 is abundant and its distribution is strongly distorted .",
    "the hi disks of ngc 4402 and ngc 4569 are truncated at the edges of the co disks . in ngc 4579",

    "the fraction of molecular gas to the total gas ( hi gas plus h@xmath3 gas ) , @xmath0 , is determined by the ism ( interstellar medium ) pressure @xmath21 , metallicity @xmath22 , and uv radiation @xmath23 @xcite . here",
    "the molecular fraction @xmath0 is defined as @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the surface mass densities of hi and h@xmath3 , respectively . since the ism pressure is approximately proportional to the square of the gas surface density @xcite , @xmath27 @xmath0",

    "@xmath0 is always larger than the dashed curve .",
    " figure 3         ram pressure stripping is a possible interpretation of the unusually large @xmath0 of ngc 4402 , ngc 4569 , and ngc 4579 .",
    "ram pressure stripping would occur if the criterion @xmath46 is satisfied , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the volume number density of the ism and the icm , respectively , @xmath49 is the galactocentric radius of the element , @xmath50 is the thickness of the gas disk , @xmath51 is the relative velocity of an ism cloud against the icm , and @xmath52 is the rotational velocity of the galaxy .",
    "for a simple case , we consider a gas disk with thickness @xmath53 kpc , rotating at @xmath54 km",
    "s@xmath8 . for a typical icm wind with @xmath55 h cm@xmath8 , and @xmath57 km s@xmath8 in the virgo cluster @xcite",
    ", we obtain for the criterion of where ram pressure stripping can occur , @xmath58.\\ ] ]    the hi gas can be dominant in the inter - arm region even in inner disks , and its density typically ranges from @xmath59 to @xmath60 h @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the hi gas can be stripped even in the inner disks . on the other hand , the molecular cloud",
    "can hardly be stripped because the gas density in the molecular cloud is @xmath62 h@xmath3 @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the hi gas can be stripped selectively from a disk , although the molecular gas still remains in the disk . in this case , @xmath0 in the @xmath28@xmath0 diagram moves toward the upper - left side of the @xmath28@xmath0 curve of field galaxies .",
    "ngc 4402 , ngc 4569 , and ngc 4579 are located within the projected radius of @xmath63 from m87 at the center of the cluster , and are known to be hi deficient . hence , they must have experienced ram pressure stripping of the hi gas .",
    "we emphasize that in these three galaxies , ( 1 ) the hi disks are restricted within the central co disks of @xmath64 radii ( 7 kpc ) ( figure 1 ) , ( 2 ) the hi clouds can satisfy the criterion of ram pressure stripping while the molecular clouds can not , and ( 3 ) the @xmath28@xmath0 diagrams show unusually large @xmath0 , indicating that the inner disks are highly hi deficient ( figure 3 ) .",
    "these three facts support the scenario that the ram pressure stripping of hi gas occurred even in the inner disks .",
    "on the other hand , ngc 4254 and ngc 4654 are located as far as @xmath65 from the center of the cluster .",
    "they show the hi distribution extending to the outer disks and the @xmath28@xmath0 relation being the same as that of field galaxies .",
    "hence , most of the hi gas must have not yet been stripped in spite of the strongly distorted hi disks .",
    "another possibility for making @xmath0 large is a higher external pressure due to the icm - pressure , or the ram pressure , which might make the ism pressure larger than that estimated by the surface density .",
    "the icm pressure affects all gas disks isotropically .",
    "the typical density and temperature of the icm at the virgo cluster are @xmath66 @xmath61 and @xmath67 k , respectively @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical density and temperature of the interstellar molecular gas are @xmath68 @xmath61 and @xmath69 k , respectively .",
    "since the pressure @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath70 , the icm pressure and ism pressure are comparable to each other near the cluster center .    the ram pressure would also increase the ism pressure if the ism were not stripped , as mentioned by @xcite .",
    "the typical velocity of a galaxy is @xmath71 km s@xmath8 near the virgo cluster center .",
    "the velocity dispersion of a molecular cloud is typically @xmath72 km s@xmath8 . since the pressure @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath73 , the ram and the ism pressures are comparable near the cluster center . as a result , the ism pressure would increase and the higher ism pressure would make @xmath0 larger .",
    "we present the @xmath28@xmath0 relation in figure [ fmol - px2 ] , adopting @xmath74 .",
    "the second term indicates an increment of the ism pressure due to the icm or the ram pressure .",
    "figure [ fmol - px2 ] shows that the icm pressure makes @xmath0 much larger .",
    "thus , we can conclude that a higher external pressure due to icm or ram pressures could be the origin of the large @xmath0 .      because the metallicity strongly affects @xmath0 , the larger metallicity might be an origin of the large @xmath0 . in order to examine",
    "whether the large metallicity makes @xmath0 large , data on the metallicity distributions are necessary",
    ". however , there is no available data for these galaxies , except for ngc 4254 .",
    "therefore , we below present a new idea to calculate the metallicity distribution using the co , hi , and h@xmath75 data instead of using the metallicity data .",
    "the metallicity is expressed using the oxygen abundance @xmath76})$ ] , which is correlated with the conversion factor @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "we here define @xmath78}),\\ ] ] and adopt the relationship @xmath79 the metallicity of the solar neighborhood @xmath80 is taken to be 8.9 .",
    "we can calculate the h@xmath3 surface density using @xmath77 if @xmath22 is given . combining the hi and h@xmath3 surface densities , we obtain the total gas density @xmath28 , which gives the pressure @xmath21 based on equation ( [ eq - pressure ] ) .",
    "the uv strength can be calculated using the h@xmath75 data .",
    "images of the virgo cluster galaxies , except for ngc 4402 , were archived by @xcite .",
    "figure [ halpha ] shows contours of h@xmath75 superimposed onto the co images .",
    "we convolved the h@xmath75 image with the same beams as the hi data .",
    "we adopted @xmath81 erg cm@xmath34 s@xmath8 sr@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "for ngc 4402 , we estimated @xmath23 while considering the schmidt law , @xmath82 where we adopted @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "thus , we can calculate @xmath77 , @xmath21 , and @xmath23 if @xmath22 is given .",
    "using obtained @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath22 , we can calculate the molecular fraction @xmath0 based on the model of @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we can independently calculate @xmath0 using only the hi and h@xmath3 surface densities .",
    "we search for an appropriate metallicity , which gives the same @xmath0 in the two ways .",
    "the searching range of the metallicity is adopted to be @xmath84 .",
    "this procedure is presented as a flow - chart in figure [ flowchart ] .",
    "we plotted the calculated metallicity against the radius for each galaxy ( figure [ metal ] ) .",
    "each point corresponds to each observed point .",
    "the metallicities of ngc 4254 and ngc 4654 show that @xmath85 is about 9.5  10 at the galactic center , and that it gradually declines .",
    "the metallicity of ngc 4254 was calculated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our obtained values are almost consistent with their results .    on the other hand , the metallicities @xmath85 of ngc 4402 , ngc",
    "4569 , and ngc 4579 often exceed 10 .",
    "however , the former research shows that there is no galaxy that gives @xmath86 .",
    "in addition , the dispersions of @xmath85 of ngc 4402 , ngc 4569 , and ngc 4579 are larger than the others . moreover , the metallicities @xmath85 of ngc 4402 and ngc 4569 increase with the radius .",
    "this tendency is unnatural because the metallicity @xmath85 usually decreases with the radius @xcite . in the case of ngc 4579",
    ", there are many points where @xmath22 can not be calculated within the solution range @xmath84 in the inner region .    therefore , the possibility of higher metallicity is less plausible , because an abnormal metallicity distribution is necessary to reproduce such a large @xmath0 .",
    "however , this possibility still can not be ruled out , since nobody has directly measured the metallicities of ngc 4402 , ngc 4569 , and ngc 4579 .",
    "because the uv strength affects @xmath0 , a lower uv radiation field might be the origin of the large @xmath0 . in order to examine this effect , we plotted the relation between the uv strength and the total gas density ( figure [ gas - uv ] ) , excluding the central 1 kpc to avoid h@xmath75 emission from active galactic nuclei .",
    "this figure shows that there is little difference in the uv strength , @xmath87 , for @xmath88 pc@xmath34 , although @xmath87 is lower in ngc 4569 than in ngc 4254 and ngc 4654 in the case of @xmath89 pc@xmath34 .",
    "thus , it is difficult to attribute the large @xmath0 to a lower uv radiation field , because a large @xmath0 for @xmath88 pc@xmath34 can not be explained by a difference in the uv strength .",
    "we observed five virgo spiral galaxies with the nro 45 m telescope with bears in the @xmath1co@xmath2 line . comparing the co data with the hi data to investigate the environmental effect",
    ", we found that ( 1 ) the hi gas disks of ngc 4402 , ngc 4569 , and ngc 4579 , located near the center of the cluster , are restricted within the inner disks , ( 2 ) the hi clouds can satisfy the criterion of the ram pressure stripping , while the molecular clouds can not , and ( 3 ) the @xmath28@xmath0 diagrams of the three galaxies show an unusually large @xmath0 for a low total gas column density .",
    "this large @xmath0 might imply that the hi gas is selectively stripped .",
    "on the other hand , ngc 4254 and ngc 4654 , located far from the cluster center , have extended hi disks and show the normal @xmath0 expected for field galaxies .",
    "most of the hi gas of these two galaxies must not have been stripped , in spite of the strongly distorted hi disks .",
    "moreover , we examined whether differences in the intrinsic conditions ( metallicity and uv ) cause the unusually large @xmath0 . as a result",
    ", we found that an unusually high metallicity is necessary to explain such a large @xmath0 , although it still can not be ruled out .      from these discussions , we note that the @xmath28@xmath0 diagram is a good tool for investigating the environmental effect .",
    "an abnormal @xmath0 indicates that the ism suffers cluster environmental effects : ram pressure stripping or higher external pressure .",
    "we are grateful to the members of the nobeyama radio observatory .",
    "we appreciate that m. honma kindly provided his code to calculate @xmath0 .",
