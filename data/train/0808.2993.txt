    "electromagnetic waves in free space constitute an important part of the calculus  based introductory physics course .",
    "in addition to other properties , all the textbooks we have surveyed include a discussion of the transverse nature of the waves . specifically , that ( plane ) electromagnetic waves have the electric field strength @xmath0 and the magnetic induction @xmath1 perpendicular to the propagation direction of the wave and to each other so that @xmath2 is an even permutation of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the poynting vector .",
    "the extent of the coverage and the arguments brought in the textbooks vary widely .",
    "while we have not checked all textbooks , none of the ones we have surveyed include a full and detailed theoretical argument for these important properties , even though all textbooks include the infrastructure needed for that purpose , i.e. , the ( integral ) maxwell equations .",
    "most textbooks derive the wave equations for the transverse components of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields , but do not show that these wave equations are unique , i.e. , that a longitudinal component violates the maxwell equations .",
    "that is , they show that transverse waves are _ consistent _ with the maxwell equations , but not that they are required .",
    "we make the case here that the theoretical argument is important for students of the calculus  based introductory course .",
    "much research has shown that understanding and retention of physics is enhanced if important concepts are not brought just as factoids , but rather derived from theoretical and physical argumentation . in the case of transversality of ( plane ) electromagnetic waves our case is even strengthened , as the argument is certainly at the right level for students of such courses . indeed ,",
    "a general demonstration without assuming planar symmetry is clearly beyond the scope of the introductory course , and rightfully belongs to more advanced courses .",
    "however , the physics and mathematics needed for the demonstration for plane electromagnetic waves are readily available for students of the introductory course , and in fact are already included in most textbooks we surveyed .",
    "therefore , no new physics or mathematics are needed to demonstrate the transversality of ( plane ) electromagnetic waves in the introductory course .",
    "all that is needed is to arrange the arguments that are already in the student s toolkit to achieve deeper level of understanding .",
    "the textbooks we have surveyed ( and again , we emphasize our literature search was not exhaustive , as the number of textbooks is indeed very large ; we do believe we have found the tendencies of existing textbooks ) fall under the following categories .",
    "a : textbooks that postulate the transversality ( but do nt derive it ) , and then show consistency with the ( either all four or just the dynamical ) maxwell equations @xcite ; category b : textbooks that only use the two dynamical equations ( faraday s law and the ampre ",
    "maxwell law ) to derive the wave equations for the ( transverse ) components of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields , but do nt show that _ only _ transverse fields are allowed @xcite ; and category c : textbooks that add to the treatment of category b also a demonstration that a longitudinal component of the @xmath0 field is disallowed ( but not that a transverse component is consistent with the maxwell equations ) @xcite . interestingly ,",
    "even introductory books that discuss the differential maxwell equations do not include a demonstration of the transversality of electromagnetic waves @xcite ( we have not surveyed more advanced books , appropriate for upper division courses on electromagnetism ) .",
    "none of the textbooks we have surveyed include physical arguments for the transversality of electromagnetic waves , even though all of them discuss polarization . on the other hand ,",
    "none of the textbooks we have surveyed include a discussion of the impossibility of genuine spherical electromagnetic waves ( either monopole of a combination of multipoles ) @xcite .",
    "either polarization or hypothetical spherical electromagnetic waves may be used in physical arguments for the transversality of electromagnetic waves .",
    "this omission is surprising , as building strong physical intuition is widely considered a primary goal of such courses .",
    "many of the properties of electromagnetic waves can be demonstrated also for the algebra  based introductory course @xcite , but examination of these arguments and their use in textbooks are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our theoretical argument is by no means original , and surely has been made numerous times .",
    "it is however absent in its entirety from all textbooks we have surveyed .",
    "even if it does appear in textbooks we have not surveyed , we believe it is fair to state that most textbooks do not include the full argument , and that similarly most calculus  based introductory physics courses do not discuss it .    in advanced courses",
    "the transversality of electromagnetic waves is easily shown @xcite from the maxwell equations and the wave equation for the vector potential @xmath5 in the lorenz gauge , and the skew symmetry of the maxwell  faraday tensor @xmath6 .",
    "consider , say , a vector potential @xmath7 .",
    "the only nonvanishing independent components of @xmath8 are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "these @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields manifestly satisfy the aforementioned properties , although the formality of the demonstration in addition to being inappropriate for the introductory course is devoid of physical insight .",
    "( one may of course try to impose longitudinality : take @xmath12 .",
    "one then finds that @xmath13 is non - zero , and one might be tempted to identify it with @xmath14 .",
    "however , the postulated vector potential is not a solution for the maxwell equations in the lorenz gauge , as can be readily verified . )",
    "one can also show the transversality without invoking tensor analysis , using only vector analysis methods @xcite .",
    "the demonstration using elementary methods is important , as it involves more physical insight than the advanced , more formal proof .",
    "notably , electromagnetic waves in matter do not have to be transverse @xcite . longitudinal electromagnetic waves ( or combinations of longitudinal and transverse waves )",
    "indeed exist in inhomogeneous media and in cavities ( because of the cavity s boundary conditions ) @xcite .",
    "one may also have in vacuum electromagnetic waves with @xmath15 , but those are standing waves ( with vanishing poynting vector ) @xcite .",
    "these interesting cases are typically beyond the scope of the introductory course .    in this paper",
    "we present a full argument for the transversality of ( plane ) electromagnetic waves in vacuum .",
    "we are hopeful that instructors of calculus  based introductory physics courses present a full argument in their classes .",
    "we use si units despite their awkwardness ( for the description of electrodynamics ) , as this appears to be the nearly universal practice in textbooks .",
    "we use only the integral form of the maxwell equations , as nearly all introductory textbooks ( for _ calculus_based physics ) refrain from introducing differential operators . in section [ phys_arg ]",
    "we describe physical arguments for the transversality of electromagnetic waves , based on polarization and on ( lack of ) monopole radiation . in section [ theor_arg ]",
    "we present a full argument at a level appropriate for the introductory calculus  based physics course , as follows : first , we show that @xmath0 can not have a longitudinal component , and that @xmath0 may have a transversal component .",
    "we then repeat the arguments for the @xmath1 field .",
    "we then show that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields are orthogonal to each other and to the direction of propagation , and finally , we show that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields satisfy the wave equation .",
    "we emphasize that the only assumption we make is that of planar symmetry . except for this assumption ( which makes the derivation possible for the introductory course )",
    "our argument is general .",
    "many introductory courses include a demonstration of polarization that includes two polaroid films , so that one can be rotated relative to the other .",
    "when the polarization directions of the two polaroids are orthogonal , no light is going through the polaroids , and the image on the screen is dark .",
    "assume there were a longitudinal component to the @xmath0 field .",
    "this component may be transmitted through either polaroid , so that a longitudinal component would arrive to the screen through both polaroids even when they are orthogonal .",
    "therefore , with a longitudinal component the screen will never get totally dark when the two polaroids are in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the light .",
    "a variant of this argument was given by schutz @xcite .",
    "schutz considers the two polarizers rotating relative to each other in the plane orthogonal to the direction of propagation . as",
    "the brightness on the screen oscillates with the polarizers , one must conclude the electric field acts across its motion , i.e. , transversally .    in order to make our argument compelling ,",
    "students need to have at least a qualitative understanding of how simple dichroic devices such as a wire ",
    "grid polaroid work ( most introductory texts do not discuss in depth other polarizers , such as beam  splitting polarizers , birefringent polarizers , or polarization by reflection ) . such understanding may be expected from students of the relevant course : there are three microscopic mechanism that filter out the component of the @xmath0 field in the plane of the polaroid parallel to the direction of the wires ( or polyvinyl alcohol polymers doped with an iodine solution in a commercial polaroid ) : first , by the lorentz force law , conduction electrons are accelerated along the wires , and oscillate with the oscillating @xmath0 field .",
    "when colliding with lattice atoms , kinetic energy is transferred to the lattice , thereby transferring energy from the parallel component of the @xmath0 field to the lattice (  joule heating \" ) .",
    "second , the oscillating conduction electrons reradiate in all directions , so that half the reradiation is backward ( reflection ) and the remainder forward .",
    "the backward reradiation takes away more energy from the parallel component of the @xmath0 field .",
    "the forward reradiation is not entirely in the direction of the original incident plane wave , so that it scatters and little of it arrives at the detector .",
    "most importantly , the forward reradiation is generally out of phase with the incident @xmath0 field ( phase difference of @xmath16 radians ) , thereby reducing it further by destructive interference @xcite .",
    "some textbooks explain the polarization effect by stretching a mechanical model too far . in such texts the electric field",
    "is modeled by a tension wave in a string that is passing through a fence with parallel beams @xcite .",
    "the mechanical wave naturally is transmitted only if the string oscillates parallel to the beams .",
    "this argument might imply the wrong component of the @xmath0 field is transmitted .",
    "for this reason , those texts refer to the polarization direction of the polarizer , stating that perpendicular components are filtered out . but this argument may then persuade some students to believe a longitudinal component of the @xmath0 field is also filtered out , such that this sort of argumentation , in addition to not empowering the students with an understanding of simple dichroic devices work , also might prevent them from understanding a simple physical argument for why electromagnetic waves are transverse , and give the students a misleading physical picture of electromagnetic fields oscillating in the space between the wires .      consider a hypothetical monopole electromagnetic wave .",
    "then , a radially pulsating spherical charge distribution would emit such spherical outgoing waves .",
    "as the fundamental equations of physics are symmetrical under time reversal ( @xmath17 ) , an incoming imploding spherical monopole wave would make an otherwise static spherical charge distribution pulsate radially .",
    "each charge pulsates radially because of a radial force acting on it .",
    "the form of the lorentz force law then implies there were a radial @xmath0 field acting on the charges .",
    "but a radial @xmath0 field is perpendicular to the imploding spherical wave front and therefore in the same direction of its motion , so that the @xmath0 field would have a longitudinal component .",
    "this qualitative argument implies that a monopole electromagnetic wave is necessarily longitudinal .",
    "( while students of the introductory course generally have not studied multipole expansions of the electromagnetic field , the argument may still be used in reference to a truly spherical wave front . )",
    "we do know , however , that outside a spherical charge distribution the electromagnetic field is static , as the monopole piece of the electromagnetic field is non - radiative .",
    "students are exposed to this argument also in newtonian gravity : because of the inverse square force law ( common to both newton s and coulomb s laws ) the field strength of any spherical charge ( or mass ) distribution is the same as if all the charge ( or mass ) were concentrated at the center .",
    "specifically , the electric field outside a radially pulsating spherical charge distribution is static .",
    "therefore , the longitudinal component of the @xmath0 field can not exist , as such a longitudinal component would have to be radiated by a pulsating spherical charge distribution @xcite .",
    "this physical argument may be cast in a more mathematical form , using a theorem from vector calculus that states that no unit two  dimensional continuous vector field @xmath18 on a sphere may exist on the entire sphere ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "this theorem is normally beyond the scope of the introductory course .",
    "in addition , it requires the assumption of transversality ( namely , that @xmath18 is a two - dimensional vector field on the sphere , or @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , it may be used to argue that any such spherical electromagnetic wave would have to be longitudinal .",
    "consider a plane electromagnetic wave traveling in vacuum in the direction of @xmath22 .",
    "( our coordinates may be rotated to this orientation . ) because of the planar symmetry the most general electric field strength is @xmath23 . in what follows",
    "we omit the explicit time dependence of fields .",
    "we first show there can be no component @xmath24 : construct a gaussian surface enclosing a volume @xmath25 as in fig .",

    "the components @xmath33 and @xmath14 identically do not contribute to the lhs integral , as these components are not functions of @xmath34 or @xmath35 , respectively , and as they are in the plane of the faces of the surface whose normals are in the direction of @xmath22 .",
    "notice that there is no flux of @xmath24 through the faces of the gaussian surfaces in the @xmath36 or @xmath37 directions because of the orthogonality of @xmath24 to the surface s normals .",
    "this immediately implies @xmath38 , or @xmath24 does not obey a non - trivial wave equation .",
    "therefore , the most general electric field is @xmath39 . without loss of generality",
    ", we may rotate our coordinate system so that @xmath40 .",
    "our demonstration depends on the lack of charges .",
    "presence of charges requires a non - vanishing gradient of @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , gauss s law would not be violated for longitudinal waves without assuming vacuum , as there are charges and inhomogeneities in matter .",
    "therefore , this demonstration does not rule out longitudinal waves in matter or inhomogeneous media .",
    "components of either @xmath0 or @xmath1 have to be independent of @xmath41 .",
    "the arrows indicate a case in which they are not .",
    "then , the surface integral must be nonzero , and proportional to their @xmath41 derivatives . in the case of @xmath0",
    "this implies free charges inside the box , i.e. , a continuous charge distribution , which contradicts the vacuum assumption . in the case of @xmath1",
    "that distribution would be of magnetic monopoles.,width=326 ]      consider next an electric field @xmath40 , as in fig .",
    "[ gauss2 ] . applying gauss s law",
    "does not yield a restriction on @xmath33 , because the lhs of the integral vanishes identically , as @xmath42 : @xmath43\\,dx\\,dz=0\\ , .\\ ] ]    this step may of course be combined with the preceding one by taking @xmath31 , and showing that gauss s law becomes @xmath38 . in conclusion ,",
    "a transverse component for @xmath0 is consistent with gauss s law .",
    "of course , were there not a transverse component , the solution would become trivial ( no electromagnetic wave ) .",
    "therefore , for any electromagnetic wave a transverse @xmath0 field is necessary .     or @xmath1 leads to no contradiction : as the fields are functions of only the spatial coordinate @xmath41 ( in addition to the time @xmath44 ) , the surface integral of the fields vanish along all faces , either because of the field being parallel to the face ( faces parallel to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 planes ) or because the field exiting the surface completely balances the field entering ( faces parallel to the @xmath47 plane ) .",
    "it is therefore important that the fields are only functions of @xmath41 , otherwise the cancellation would not be exact . ,",

    "<S> introductory calculus  based physics textbooks state that electromagnetic waves are transverse and list many of their properties , but most such textbooks do not bring forth arguments why this is so . </S>",
    "<S> both physical and theoretical arguments are at a level appropriate for students of courses based on such books , and could be readily used by instructors of such courses . here , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two physical arguments ( based on polarization experiments and on lack of monopole electromagnetic radiation ) , and the full argument for the transversality of ( plane ) electromagnetic waves based on the integral maxwell equations . </S>",
    "<S> we also show , at a level appropriate for the introductory course , why the electric and magnetic fields in a wave are in phase and the relation of their magnitudes . </S>"
