    "this is obviously not good enough for serious neutron star seismology .",
    "one must include : ( i ) the non - axisymmetric modes , ( ii ) the toroidal magnetic field , ( iii ) the realistic density profile .",

    "the late time asymptotic is determined solely by the location of the tips of the cuts and is not affected by the choice of the x - contour .",
