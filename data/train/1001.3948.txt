    "in the last years a number of exciting discoveries of new hadron states , the so called @xmath4 mesons , have challenged our description of the hadron spectroscopy . among them , one of the most mysterious states is the well established @xmath3 .",
    "it was first discovered by the belle collaboration in the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum of the decay @xmath6",
    "its existence was soon confirmed by babar  @xcite , cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the world average mass is @xmath7 and its width @xmath8 .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath9 decay  @xcite implies an even @xmath10-parity .",
    "moreover angular correlation between final state particles in the @xmath11 decay measured by belle  @xcite suggests that the @xmath12 and @xmath13 may be ruled out and strongly favors the @xmath14 quantum numbers although the @xmath15 combination can not be excluded .",
    "a later analysis by cdf collaboration  @xcite of the same decay is compatible with the belle results and concludes from the dipion mass spectrum that the most likely quantum numbers should be @xmath14 but can not totally exclude the @xmath16 combination .",
    "these conclusions were confirmed by a new cdf analysis of the decay @xmath17 followed by @xmath18 excluding all the other possible quantum numbers at @xmath19 confidence level  @xcite .",
    "however the small phase space available for the decay @xmath20 observed by belle  @xcite discards the @xmath21 leaving the @xmath22 assignment as the most probable option .    in the @xmath22 sector",
    "the only well established state in the pdg  @xcite is the @xmath23 with a mass @xmath24 .",
    "the first excitation is expected around @xmath25 . in this energy region belle",
    "has reported the observation of three resonant structures denoted by @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the last one was observed by belle in the @xmath29 reaction  @xcite and is already included in the pdg as the @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath26 has been seen as a peak in the recoiling mass spectrum of @xmath31 produced in @xmath32 collision .",
    "its main decay channel is @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 appears as a threshold enhancement in the @xmath33 invariant mass distribution of the @xmath34 decay  @xcite .",
    "finally , cdf collaboration has reported a new structure in the @xmath35 decay at a mass of @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "this state , called @xmath37 has some similarities to the @xmath27 state as far as decay channel is concerned .",
    "the decays measured for the @xmath3 outlines a puzzling structure . in one hand",
    "the decays into @xmath38 and @xmath39 through @xmath40 and @xmath41 mesons respectively suggests a sizable isospin breaking , incompatible with a @xmath1 structure . in the other hand",
    "the radiative decays into @xmath42 and @xmath43 suggest a sizable @xmath1 component .",
    "in this work we present a coupled channel calculation of the @xmath22 sector including both @xmath1 and @xmath0 states .",
    "the calculation is done in the framework of the constituent quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite widely used in hadronic spectroscopy .",
    "we start assuming a wave function given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 are @xmath1 eigenstates of the two body hamiltonian , @xmath46 are @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) eigenstates describing the @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) mesons , @xmath51 is the two meson state with @xmath52 quantum numbers coupled to total @xmath53 quantum numbers and @xmath54 is the relative wave function between the two mesons in the molecule .",
    "the eigenstates of the @xmath10-parity operator are given by @xmath55 .",
    "we use a phenomenological @xmath2 model  @xcite to couple the two and four quark systems using the operator @xmath56^{c=1,i=0,s=1,j=0 } \\label{tbon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) are the quark ( antiquark ) quantum numbers and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are dimensionless constants that gives the strength of the @xmath61 pair creation from the vacuum .",
    "the value of gamma is fitted to the @xmath62 decay width .    using the wave - function from eq .",
    "( [ ec : funonda ] ) with the two body eigenfunctions for all the mesons we apply the resonant group method to obtain the dynamics in the two meson sector .",
    "we finnally end up with the coupled channel equation @xmath63 where we include the @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xmath0 partial waves and @xmath66 is an effective interaction between the two mesons due to the coupling with intermediate @xmath1 states with @xmath67    the @xmath1 probabilities are given by @xmath68 with the normalization condition @xmath69 .",
    ".[t1 ] masses and channel probabilities for the three states in three different calculations .",
    "the first three states are found when we perform and isospin symmetric calculation with a value of @xmath70 fit to the decay @xmath71 .",
    "the second three states shows the effect of isospin breaking in the @xmath0 masses .",
    "the last three states correspond to a value of @xmath72 that fits the experimental mass of the @xmath3 .",
    "the probability is shown as zero when it is less than @xmath73 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results are given in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "part a corresponds to the isospin symmetric case while part b shows the effect of isospin breaking in phase space . in both cases no bound state",
    "is found without coupling to the @xmath1 sector , neither in the @xmath74 nor in the @xmath75 . this coupling generates a new state with an energy close to the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "having in mind that the @xmath2 model is probably too naive and we might be overestimating the value of @xmath70 , we vary this parameter to get the experimental binding energy . the probabilities are given in part c of table  [ t1 ] .",
    "in order to compare the predictions of our model with the experimental data we use a flatt - like parametrization of the @xmath0 amplitude following ref .  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section to final @xmath0 states is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 gives the branching to @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the width calculated from the @xmath2 model and @xmath80 where @xmath81 accounts for the width due to other processes different from the opening of the near @xmath0 threshold .",
    "this can consistently be done in our formalism assuming that the process takes place through the @xmath0 components of the @xmath3 which decays into @xmath85 and then into the final @xmath86 state .",
    "the decay width of the process is given by @xmath87 the amplitude @xmath88 is calculated in our model by the rearrangement diagrams of fig .",
    "[ diag ] , averaged with the @xmath0 component of the @xmath3 wave function .",
    "the rearrangement diagrams are calculated following ref .",
    "the amplitude is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 the spin - flavor - color matrix elements are taken from ref .",
    "once the decay width @xmath91 is calculated , the differential rate is given by @xmath92 in order to compare with the experimental data we determine the number of events distributions from the differential cross section following ref .",

    "a background is taken into account modelled as in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the @xmath93",
    "the @xmath94 signal interferes with the background and so a phase @xmath95 and @xmath96 have been introduced .",
    "also the experimental branching ratio @xmath97 is introduced .",

    "the solid line gives the result using the resolution functions as in ref .",
    "all the resolution functions are those given by belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite collaboration with the exception of the babar @xmath105 resolution where we use the prescription from ref .  @xcite .",
    "we find a good description of the belle @xmath106 data whereas the agreement is poor in the case of the babar data .",
    "it is important to notice that in the belle analysis the mass of the @xmath107 appears as @xmath108 while in the babar data the resonance is located @xmath109 above .",
    "the babar mass value does not coincide with the mass of the @xmath107 obtained in our calculation which may be the reason for the disagreement .",
    "the @xmath104 data are equally well described for the belle and babar experiments . in this case",
    "both collaborations give similar values for the mass of the resonance , namely @xmath110 , which are in much better agreement with our result .",
    "concerning other @xmath4 states , the @xmath26 , decaying to @xmath111 , with mass @xmath112 is a good candidate to our state with a @xmath113 @xmath22 @xmath1 component and mass @xmath114 ( see table  [ t1 ] part c ) .",
    "with respect to the other two states , it has been suggested that both , the @xmath27 decaying to @xmath115 and @xmath37 decaying to @xmath116 , are @xmath117 and @xmath118 hadronic molecules with @xmath119 respectively .",
    "we have explore these channels but we have not found in principle any molecular bound state .    as a summary",
    ", we have shown that the @xmath3 emerges in a constituent quark model calculation as a dynamically generated mixed state of a @xmath0 molecule and @xmath120 .",
    "this structure allows to understand simultaneously the isospin violation showed by the experimental data and the radiative decay rates .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that this solution explains the new belle data in the @xmath121 and @xmath86 decay modes and the @xmath86 babar data .",
