    "the nucleon structure functions are basic tool for understanding the nucleon internal structure in the language of qcd . and",
    "at the same time , the measuring and analysis of the structure functions represent the important experimental test of this theory .",
    "unpolarized nucleon structure functions are known with high accuracy in very broad kinematical region , but in recent years also some precision measurements on the polarized structure functions have been completed @xcite . for present status of the nucleon spin structure",
    "see e.g. @xcite and citations therein .",
    "the more formal aspects of the nucleon structure functions are explained in @xcite .",
    "in fact only the complete set of the four electromagnetic unpolarized and polarized structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 can give a consistent picture of the nucleon .",
    "however , this picture is usually drawn in terms of the distribution functions , which are connected with the structure functions by some model - dependent way .",
    "distribution functions are not directly accessible from the experiment and model , which is normally applied for their extraction from the structure functions is the well known quark - parton model ( qpm ) .",
    "application of this model for analysis and interpretation of the unpolarized data does not create any contradiction . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation is much less clear in the case of spin functions @xmath2 and @xmath1 .    in our previous study",
    "@xcite we have suggested , that a reasonable explanation of the experimentally measured spin functions @xmath3 @xmath1 is possible in terms of a generalized covariant qpm , in which the quark intrinsic motion ( i.e. 3d motion with respect to the nucleon rest frame ) is consistently taken into account",
    ". therefore the quark transversal momentum appears in this approach on the same level as the longitudinal one .",
    "the quarks are represented by the free dirac spinors , which allows to obtain exact and covariant solution for relations between the quark momentum distribution functions and the structure functions accessible from experiment . in this way",
    "the model ( in its present leading order version ) contains no dynamics but only exactkinematics of quarks , so it can be effective tool for analysis and interpretation of the experimental data on structure functions , particularly for separating effects of the dynamics ( qcd ) from effects of the kinematics .",
    "this point of view is well supported by our previous results :    _ a ) _ in the cited papers we showed , that the model simply implies the well known sum rules ( wanzura - wilczek , efremov - leader - teryaev , burkhardt - cottingham ) for the spin functions @xmath3 @xmath1 .",
    "_ b _ ) simultaneously , we showed that the same set of assumptions implies rather substantial dependence of the first moment @xmath4 of the function @xmath2 on the kinematical effects .    _",
    "c ) _ further , we showed that the model allows to calculate the functions @xmath3 @xmath1 from the unpolarized valence quark distributions and the result is quite compatible with the experimental data .    _",
    "d ) _ in the paper @xcite  we showed that the model allows to relate the transversity distribution to some other structure functions .",
    "these results can not be obtained from the standard versions of the qpm ( naive or the qcd improved ) , which are currently used for the analysis of experimental data on structure functions .",
    "the reason is , that the standard qpm is based on the simplified and non - covariant kinematics in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) , which does not allow to properly take into account the quark intrinsic or orbital motion .",
    "the subject of our previous study was the question : _ what is the dependence of the structure functions on quark intrinsic motion ?",
    "_ the aim of the present paper is a discussion of related problems :    _ 1 . how to extract information about the quark intrinsic motion from the experimentally measured structure functions ?",
    "_    _ 2 . what is the role of the quark orbital momentum , which is a particular case of intrinsic motion ? _    the paper is organized as follows . in the first part of sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the basic formulas , which follow from the generalized qpm , are presented .",
    "resulting general  covariant relations are compared with their limiting case , which is represented by the standard formulation of the qpm in the imf . in the next part of the section",
    "the relations for calculation of 3d quark momentum distributions from the structure functions are derived .",
    "the quark momentum distributions are obtained from the experimentally measured structure functions @xmath5 and @xmath2  and it is shown how their combination allows to calculate the momentum distributions of the positively and negatively polarized quarks .",
    "the particular form of the quark intrinsic motion is the orbital momentum . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the role of the quark orbital momentum in covariant description is discussed and it is shown , why its contribution to the total quark angular momentum can be quite substantial .",
    "it is demonstrated , that the orbital motion is an inseparable part of the covariant approach .",
    "the problem of quark orbital momentum in the context of nucleon spin was recognized and studied also in many previous papers , see e.g. sehgal , ratc , abbas , kep , casu , bqma , brod , waka , waka1,song , ji .",
    "the last section is devoted to a short summary and conclusion .",
    "in our previous study @xcite of the proton structure functions we showed , how these functions depend on the intrinsic motion of quarks .",
    "the quarks in the suggested model are represented by the free fermions , which are in the proton rest frame described by the set of distribution functions with spheric symmetry @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and symbol @xmath8 represents the quark and antiquark flavors .",
    "these distributions measure the probability to find a quark of given flavor in the state@xmath9where @xmath10 and @xmath11  are the quark mass and momentum , @xmath12 @xmath13 and@xmath14 coincides with the direction of proton polarization .",
    "the distributions with the corresponding quark ( and antiquark ) charges @xmath15 allow to define the generic functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and ( [ sp9 ] ) : @xmath18 and @xmath17 were denoted as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "apart of that we assumed for simplicity that only three ( valence ) quarks contribute to the sums ( [ sp8a ] ) and ( [ sp9 ] ) .",
