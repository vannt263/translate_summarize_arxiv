    "it is well established that nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements of diffusing spins can be used to probe the geometry of porous media .",
    "the nmr response is sensitive to the surface to volume ratio of the confining pore space  @xcite . for smooth ,",
    "ideal shapes , this relationship provides a means of estimating the pore size distribution  @xcite . naturally occurring materials",
    "may however have a more complicated pore structure than these ideal shapes , leading us to pose the question : can there be a direct link to pore size when the pore geometry is not ideal ?",
    "the standard approach in a nmr relaxometry experiment is to measure the transverse ( spin - spin ) relaxation time of water protons in a porous medium and estimate the relaxation time @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the relaxation processes in the bulk fluid the protons interact with paramagnetic sites at the pore surface , which increases the relaxation rate  @xcite . in this way , the relaxation experiment is sensitive to the surface - to - volume ( s / v ) ratio of the confining porous medium .",
    "brownstein and tarr realized that the complex nature of the spin - surface interaction is well described by a robin boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "the magnetization @xmath1 in a pore is then described by the following bloch - torrey equation    @xmath2    subject to a robin condition at the pore boundary @xmath3 where the scalar @xmath4 denotes the surface relaxivity and @xmath5 the diffusion coefficient of the spins . in an nmr relaxation experiment the relaxation rate(s )",
    "are sought . omitting the bulk fluid relaxation properties we restate the classical result @xmath6 which has been derived on multiple occasions and is true in the limit of the time @xmath7 approaching zero and in the so - called fast - diffusion limit depicted by @xmath8 where r denotes the pore size  @xcite .",
    "equation [ eq : fast - diffusion - limit ] allows an estimate of the pore size distribution from nmr measurements in cases where the pores can be approximated by ideal shapes ( i.e. slabs , spheres or cylinders ) where a simple relationship between @xmath9 and the pore radius can be established .",
    "experiments  @xcite and numerical studies  @xcite suggest that not only will a deviation from ideal shapes disrupt this relationship but that surface roughness may also have an impact ; no rigorous investigation of this latter effect has been conducted .    in this paper",
    "we show that when the surface is rough ( as is true for most naturally occurring materials ) the above expression is no longer directly translatable to the pore radius and that the derived pore size can differ substantially from the actual size . we demonstrate that in the presence of surface roughness the spins still behave as being in a smooth pore , but subject to a different , effective , surface relaxivity .",
    "we provide a means of calculating this quantity , by introducing a magnetization rate coefficient describing the magnetic dissipation over the rough surface .     with some a geometrical perturbation @xmath10 separated by a fictitious boundary @xmath11.[fig:1 ] ]",
    "we begin our analysis by considering a smooth pore @xmath12 with surface @xmath13 and with a small geometrical perturbation @xmath10 , with surface @xmath14 ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) representing surface roughenss .",
    "`` small '' here means that the volume ( area in this 2d representation ) of the perturbation is much smaller than the volume ( area in this 2d representation ) of the original pore @xmath15 .",
    "`` rough '' means that the perturbation is local with respect to the pore surface i.e. if we separate the two domains with a fictitious boundary @xmath11 then the surface ( length ) of @xmath11 is much smaller than the smooth pore surface ( length ) @xmath13 .",
    "hence the geometrical perturbation @xmath10 can be seen as a local roughening of the surface .",
    "we will utilize this fictitious boundary below .    separating the diffusion equation depicted in equation [ eq : bloch - torrey ] yields the problem at hand : to find relaxation modes @xmath16 and relaxation times @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the outward pointing normal of the total pore surface @xmath20 and where @xmath21 denotes the total pore @xmath22 .",
    "we now proceed by considering the right - hand side of equation [ eq : bt ] as a charge distribution @xmath23 .",
    "the equations for the two sub - domains then become two coupled electrostatic problems @xmath24 for @xmath25 and some unknown charge distribution @xmath26 at the boundary @xmath11 .",
    "these equations are satisfied when the charge distribution @xmath23 equals the original relaxation modes @xmath27 in equation [ eq : bt ] . a general solution to the coupled electrostatic problem in equation [ eq : poissons_equation ]",
    "is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 satisfies the laplace equation @xmath30 with the inhomogeneous boundary condition at @xmath11 : @xmath31 and where @xmath32 satisfies the poisson s equation @xmath33 with all homogeneous boundary conditions i.e. @xmath34 . by defining @xmath35",
    "one may note that the solution @xmath36 satisfies the following inhomogeneous robin condition @xmath37 at @xmath11 where we call the parameter @xmath38 the magnetization transfer coefficient @xmath39 this parameter describes the magnetic dissipation over the fictious boundary @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 may be estimated by noting that the relaxation times are proportional to the pore volume , i.e. @xmath41 hence , by forming a gaussian surface one may determine that @xmath42 with @xmath40 approaching zero as @xmath43 .",
    "therefore the inhomogeneous boundary condition described by eq .",
    "[ eq : inhomogeneous_rbc ] approaches a homogeneous b.c .",
    "when the perturbation @xmath10 is much smaller than the original pore . by continuity the same boundary condition must hold in the larger pore @xmath12 as well .",
    "the magnetic transfer coefficient @xmath38 can be estimated by assuming that it is constant over @xmath11 @xmath44 ( a good approximation when @xmath45 due to the form of the relaxation modes ) .",
    "we then have @xmath46     induced by a rectangular box with base dimensions @xmath47 ( @xmath48 m ) , @xmath49 ( @xmath48 m ) and height @xmath50 ( @xmath48 m ) as a function of @xmath51 ; the base @xmath52 corresponds to the fictitious boundary ( @xmath11 ) , the opening to the larger pore .",
    "three different values of the surface relaxivity were used : @xmath53 ( @xmath48 m / s ) ( dashed ) @xmath54 ( @xmath48 m / s ) ( dotted ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath48 m / s ) ( dashed - dotted ) .",
    "the solid lines depict the initial slope and the asymptotes .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ]    in the case when the domain @xmath10 is a separable geometry and where @xmath56 denotes the normal to @xmath11 the laplace equation becomes @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the constant of separation .",
    "the solution to equation [ eq : h_eq ] is then @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the eigenfunctions perpendicular to @xmath61 . when @xmath62 ( i.e. the spins inside the small domain can be considered to be in the fast - diffusion regime )",
    "the dominant contribution will be from the lowest relaxation mode @xmath63 .",
    "therefore one can consider the approximate expression @xmath64 where the subindex @xmath65 of @xmath38 denotes the average magnetic transfer coefficient and the first coefficient @xmath66 is @xmath67 a series expansion around @xmath68 gives @xmath69 and for @xmath70 we reach the asymptotic value @xmath71    we now represent the small geometrical perturbation as a rectangular box , and show in figure [ fig:2 ] the average magnetic transfer coefficient @xmath72 plotted as a function of the height @xmath51 of the box where the base area corresponds to the fictitious boundary @xmath11 .",
    "as the height increases the increased surface area has less impact on @xmath72 , which reaches a plateau value .",
    "the major impact comes however from the area of the base , revealed in the separation constant    @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 denote the lengths of the sides of the base of the rectangular box .",
    "while there are sharp corners between the spherical surface and the rectangular box , we are working with the robin kernel , which has a smoothing effect due to the dirichlet nature that regularizes this type of sharp features  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the identified robin condition in the electrostatic presentation tends towards a homogeneous boundary condition when @xmath76 . as a consequence",
    ", the original eigenequation describing the spin relaxation in the total domain @xmath21 may be well approximated by the altered ( homogeneous ) boundary condition of the smooth domain @xmath12 in the following way @xmath77 by adding many small perturbations we reach a rough pore surface with a significantly increased surface area .",
    "this problem may then be simplified further by defining an effective surface relaxivity @xmath78 in the following way @xmath79 and utilizing the well - known analytical solutions for a smooth pore  @xcite .",
    "as an example of the usefulness of these results consider a spherical pore with a radius of @xmath80 ( @xmath48 m ) where the sphere surface is roughened by modulating the surface using small rectangular boxes ( see inset in figure 2 ) .",
    "we let the surface relaxivity of the pore surface ( including the surface of the rectangular boxes ) be @xmath53 ( @xmath48 m / s ) and let the rectangular boxes have the dimensions @xmath47 ( @xmath48 m ) , @xmath49 ( @xmath48 m ) where again the base area @xmath52 denotes the fictitious boundary @xmath11 .",
    "setting the height of the boxes to @xmath50 ( @xmath48 m ) and using a diffusion constant @xmath81 ( @xmath82 @xmath83/s ) ( corresponding to water at @xmath84 c ) we get the average magnetic transfer coefficient    @xmath85 a considerably larger value than the original assigned surface relaxivity @xmath86 .",
    "this value describes the average relaxivity over the fictitious domain @xmath11 , as induced by the inclusion of the rectangular box to roughen the surface of the large pore .",
    "if we assume that @xmath80% of the spherical surface is covered by such boxes we get the effective relaxivity    @xmath87 the deviance between the original assigned @xmath86 and the effective @xmath78 is purely geometrical and due to the roughness of the pore surface . given the effective relaxivity it is straightforward to solve for the lowest relaxation time for this spherical pore  @xcite : @xmath88 given the pore size , the original surface relaxivity and the diffusion coefficient , we would conclude that we would be justified in evaluating the pore size using the fast - diffusion limit ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "this would however give a pore size of @xmath90 ( @xmath48 m ) , a value which deviates quite substantially from the assigned @xmath91 ( @xmath48 m ) of the pore we began with .",
    "using instead the effective surface relaxivity ( obtained by calculating the average magnetic transfer coefficient ) , we find that the fast - diffusion limit no longer applies ( @xmath92 ) . in order to obtain the correct pore radius in this regime , one must instead solve for @xmath93 in the following non - linear problem ( derived by the solution to the robin problem for a sphere @xcite ) , @xmath94 this yields @xmath95 @xmath96 , which is in close agreement with the actual pore radius .     as a function of surface - to - volume ( @xmath9 ) for a rough sphere of radius @xmath91 @xmath97 where the @xmath9 is increased by covering the @xmath98 of the surface of the sphere by small rectangular boxes of width @xmath99 @xmath97 and varying the length ( squares ) and alternatively covering @xmath98 of the surface by cylinders of radius @xmath100 @xmath97 and varying the length ( triangles ) .",
    "the dashed line show the fast - diffusion approximation and the dotted line denote the limit of the slow - diffusion regime .",
    "the diffusion coefficient was set to @xmath81 @xmath101 and two values of the surface relaxivity was used , @xmath102 @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xmath103 .",
    "both cases are expected to follow the fast - diffusion limit depicted by the dashed lines and tend towards the slow - diffusion limit ( @xmath105 ) as @xmath9 increases .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ]    the magnetic transfer coefficient is straightforward to obtain analytically where the surface roughness can be modeled by analytically solvable geometries . for example",
    "a cylinder of radius @xmath106 and height @xmath51 ( where the base area @xmath107 corresponds to @xmath11 ) has the separation constant @xmath108 which coincides with the rectangular box when the @xmath109 , i.e. the magnetization transfer coefficient becomes equal .",
    "the cylinder gives the initial slope    @xmath110    and the asymptotic value    @xmath111 as @xmath51 grow large .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] depicts the inverse of the relaxation rate of a spherical pore of radius @xmath91 ( @xmath48 m ) where @xmath80% of the spherical surface is covered by such cylinders as a function of surface - to - volume where the increased surface - to - volume is modulated by varying the height of the cylinders .",
    "finally , the developed homogenization procedure has been successfully validated in numerous numerical examples ( not included ) , with different type of surface roughness .",
    "the presented theory allows us to investigate the effect of rough surfaces on nmr relaxation experiments by introducing a magnetic transfer coefficient describing the dissipation of magnetization over the rough surface .",
    "this allows a convenient way of homogenizing rough pores to smooth equivalents with an effective surface relaxivity .",
    "we find that the effective relaxivity increases dramatically in presence of rough surfaces , in particular where the surface roughness is narrow and deep .",
    "the explicit expressions for the effective relaxivity demonstrates the possibility of determining a pore length scale for rough pores when the effective surface relaxivity is known .",
    "our results agrees well with recent experimental findings by keating  @xcite where surface roughness was induced by etching the surface of glass beads and with numerical simulations by mller - petke et al ."
