    "solid state entanglers represent the electronic analogues to the optical setups used for bell inequality tests .",
    "most setups propose a superconductor as a source of spin - entangled s - wave cooper pairs @xcite . these are transferred to spatially separated leads by the process of crossed andreev reflection ( car )",
    "different setups have been considered in order to achieve car without being dominated by elastic cotunnelling or ordinary andreev reflection ( ar ) processes @xcite .",
    "s - wave cooper pairs are entangled in energy and spin space .",
    "therefore , one may either filter the electrons of a cooper pair in spin space ( using ferromagnets @xcite or luttinger liquids @xcite ) , or in energy space ( using quantum dots @xcite , coupling to an electromagnetic mode @xcite , an appropriate voltage bias @xcite or ac - bias @xcite ) . filtering using quantum dots with large onsite interaction has been successfully realized in experiment @xcite and a non - local resistance has been measured as characteristics of cooper pair splitting",
    ". moreover , a positive cross correlation measured in a superconductor and normal - metal three - terminal device gave compelling evidence for car @xcite .",
    "however , s - wave cooper pairs only give access to one of the bell states , namely @xmath0 , where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to two normal leads .",
    "p - wave cooper pairs give access to the other bell states , especially those like @xmath1 , involving fully spin - polarized combinations of the two electrons .",
    "thus , a p - wave cooper pair splitter represents the essential counterpart to s - wave cooper pair splitters as on - chip sources of spin - entangled einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) electron pairs @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we approach the problem of p - wave cooper pair splitting in two steps .",
    "first , we show that p - wave splitting may easily be identified in a hybrid junction between a superconductor and two ferromagmets ( setup shown in fig .",
    "[ sfffull ] ) . however , p - wave superconductors that can be easily handled in quantum transport experiments are presently not available .",
    "therefore , in a second step we show how p - wave splitting can be realized without using a p - wave superconductor . indeed , the previous works on the charge transfer statistics of superconductor ferromagnet beamsplitters @xcite neglected the recently predicted @xcite and observed @xcite effects of the interface on charge transfer . by including a better description of the interface",
    "one can describe the shared triplet pairs formation between the ferromagnets .",
    "we calculate the full counting statistics ( fcs ) which allows us to identify the corresponding charge transfer process and to calculate the cross correlation as an experimentally observable quantity @xcite .",
    "splitting of spin - polarized p - wave cooper pairs can easily be identified in the conductance . from the result in @xcite",
    "we find the generalization of beenakker s formula @xcite for zero - bias conductance of a beamsplitter realized by a resonant level between a superconductor and two ferromagnets @xmath2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\left[\\delta_d^2 + \\gamma_s^2 +   \\gamma^2 ( 2 + \\sigma_1 p_1 + \\sigma_2 p_2)^2\\right]^{-1 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\left[\\delta_d^2 + \\gamma_s^2 + \\gamma^2 ( 2- \\sigma_1 p_1 - \\sigma_2 p_2)^2\\right]^{-1 } , \\label{gcar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        where @xmath3 is the tunnel rate through the two barriers between the quantum dot and the ferromagnet ( both are assumed to be equal ) and @xmath4 is the tunnel rate between the superconductor and the quantum dot .",
    "@xmath5 refers to the energy of the resonant level . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the ( parallel ) polarisations of the ferromagnets and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spins of the electrons in a cooper pair . + in usual s - wave superconductivity the spin directions obey @xmath10 , and we may maximize car by choosing @xmath11 ( or vice versa ) @xcite . however , if we choose the polarisations of the ferromagnets to be equal ( i.e. @xmath12 ) @xmath13 in equation ( [ gcar ] ) becomes zero ( see fig .",
    "[ sfffull ] ) .",
    "the situation is reversed if we introduce a spin - polarized p - wave superconductor so that @xmath14",
    ". now splitting is maximized if @xmath15 .",
    "of course now for antiparallel polarisation the current is blocked ( see fig . [ sfffull ] ) .",
    "therefore p - wave splitting is easily identified in the crossed conductance .",
    "the assumption of maximal polarisation is not easy to realize in experiment @xcite but we use it to illustrate the argument .",
    "+ in spite of the apparent simplicity of this consideration a serious problem remains : p - wave superconductors are very rare and materials such as @xmath16 are hard to handle @xcite .",
    "+ however , recent theoretical and experimental progress showed that the treatment of superconductor - ferromagnet interfaces requires special care with respect to the exact form of the interface and the associated spin - active nature of tunnelling @xcite . in the rest of this work",
    "we want to show how a spin - active interface can be used in exactly the same way as a p - wave superconductor and therefore allows to generate the other bell states . in order to accomplish this goal",
    "we will show how the transport characteristics of p - wave splitting can be imitated by spin - active scattering .      to identify the separate charge transfer processes and to evaluate the conductances and cross correlations",
    "we calculate the fcs of charge transfer @xcite using the generalized keldysh technique @xcite .",
    "the aim is to calculate the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) @xmath17 of the probability distribution @xmath18 to transfer @xmath19 units of charge during a ( long ) measurement time @xmath20 : @xmath21 .",
    "partial derivatives of this function provide direct access to the cumulants ( irreducible moments ) of @xmath18 .",
    "+ we model the superconductor ferromagnet beamsplitter by two ferromagnets @xmath22 and @xmath23 which are tunnel coupled to a resonant level , which is the simplest model of a quantum dot .",
    "the superconductor is also coupled to the resonant level via @xmath24 and @xmath25 which takes into account the interface effects .",
    "the result is the hamiltonian @xmath26 represents the resonant level . throughout the rest of exposition we use units",

    "+ ferromagnetic electrodes are described in the language of electron field operators @xmath29 , where @xmath30 using the stoner model with an exchange energy @xmath31 as in @xcite @xmath32 consequently they can be described as fermionic continua with a spin - dependent dos @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the polarisation .",

    "@xmath43 refers to the electron field operator of the superconductor introduced in equation ( [ super ] ) in position space .",
    "+ finally , we need a hamiltonian approach @xcite for spin - active scattering . there are manifold effects like spin - orbit coupling , magnetic anisotropy or spin relaxation that give rise to spin - activity of interfaces @xcite .",
    "previous studies of point contacts used a scattering states description @xcite in order to introduce a spin - active scattering angle as a phenomenological parameter to characterise the interface or a wave - function matching technique @xcite .",

    "@xmath20 the cgf can be calculated analytically using a generalized green s function formalism that has previously been used to calculate the fcs of other quantum impurity systems @xcite . following @xcite the cgf",

    "the derivatives of the @xmath60 s take the form of mixed and @xmath65-dependent green s function , e.g. @xmath66.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these mixed green s functions have to account for all orders of the tunneling coupling . by expanding them to first order in the relevant tunnel coupling",
    "they can all be rewritten as a product of a bare lead green s function ( subscript @xmath67 ) and an exact - in - tunneling dot green s function .",
    "e.g. for the derivative considered above @xmath68 therefore the remaining task is an exact calculation of the dot green s function .",
    "since the system s hamiltonian in equation ( [ hsys ] ) is quadratic the dyson equation can be solved exactly . however , as also noted in @xcite , coupling of the dot to the superconductor automatically leads to the appearance of anomalous dot green s functions of the type @xmath69 to second order in the tunnel coupling to the superconductor .",
    "additionally , the spin - flipping tunnel contribution in equation ( [ t2 ] ) gives rise to correlation functions of the type @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "consequently the full dot green s function for the spin species @xmath71 becomes a 4-component vector of correlation functions @xmath72 . since the counting fields take different signs on the backward / forward branch of the keldysh contour each correlation function",
    "is a 2x2 keldysh matrix again .",
    "the bare dot and lead green s functions are e.g. given in @xcite . since the solution of the dyson equation allows to sum up all orders in the tunnelling couplings the result is exact and also valid at finite temperature as discussed also in @xcite .",
    "+ however , the result for the average in equation ( [ cgf ] ) is quite long .",
    "we want to restrict ourselves to the study of the relevant aspects of the cgf in view of the possbility of p - wave splitting only .",
    "+ comparing our method to previous treatments of superconductor hybrids we should emphasize that also in the quasiclassical green s function formalism @xcite calculations of the current exact in tunneling have been done @xcite .",
    "however , there it was assumed to have two tunnel contacts to normal leads with large spatial separation . in our case",
    "the three leads are coupled via a quantum dot which corresponds to the opposite limit and involves an energy - dependent transmission .",
    "therefore the setup considered here is closer related to the studies in refs . @xcite and @xcite where ,",
    "however , a disordered quantum dot and no spin - active scattering was assumed , whereas here we treat the ballistic case with spin - active scattering .",
    "disorder for the case of tunnel contacts was considered using the keldysh - usadel formalism in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally we want to point out that the description of spin - active scattering used here and in refs . @xcite and @xcite is different : in the latter works the spin - mixing angle is introduced as a phenomenological parameter whereas we use a second tunneling transparency to account for spin flips . for a comparison of both descriptions of tunnel contacts",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .      in simple superconductor - ferromagnet tunnelling junctions",
    "the presence of spin - active scattering gives rise to a new type of ar .",
    "in ordinary ar an electron is retroreflected as a hole with opposite spin since cooper pairs represent spin singlets .",
    "however , due to the spin - active nature of tunnelling in the setup considered here the hole or the electron spin can be flipped .",
    "this spin - flipped andreev reflection ( sar ) induces triplet correlations in the ferromagnet @xcite . to see whether similar effects occur in our setup we calculate the zero - bias conductance analogously to equation ( [ gcar ] ) for the case of @xmath73 , meaning maximal parallel polarisation @xmath74 ^ 2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath75 and @xmath76 again refer to the tunnel rates for ordinary single electron tunnelling .",
    "@xmath77 describes the additional spin - flip tunnelling rate at the interface .",
    "obviously , spin - active scattering has lifted the current blocking indicated in fig .",
    "[ sfffull ] for a s - wave superconductor connected to two maximally parallelly polarised ferromagnets .",
    "therefore this finite conductance is similar to the one obatined for a p - wave superconductor junction in equation ( [ gcar ] ) .",
    "this indicates that this conductance for voltages below the gap is indeed associated to a spin - flipped crossed andreev reflection ( scar ) in which a triplet pair is transferred to the ferromagnets .",
    "+ of course one may also obtain this information from the cgf itself .",
    "however , the expression is complicated and the probability distribution of charge transfer is also not easy to access in an experiment @xcite .",
    "therefore we follow @xcite and use the cross correlation as an indication to probe whether the two charges of a cooper pair transferred in a scar process are indeed transferred to the ferromagnets at the same time . the presence of non - zero @xmath78 at voltages below the gap and @xmath79 in combination with a positive cross correlation",
    "can only be explained by a simultaneous transfer of a triplet pair to the ferromagnets , which implies that we indeed observe p - wave splitting .",
    "the cross correlation can be calculated as a mixed second derivative of the cgf @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined ] the result of equation ( [ cross ] ) is shown for two different configurations of the couplings and polarisations . for moderate polarisation ( @xmath81 ) and no spin - active scattering",
    "we find two cases in which positive cross correlation can be observed in accordance with previous results @xcite .",
    "first , for voltages close to the superconducting gap and @xmath82 car is strongly suppressed and one expects single electron transmission to be dominant .",
    "nonetheless , the energy - dependent dos of the superconductor leads to large transmission coefficients for double ar from one ferromagnet to the superconductor and further to the second ferromagnet .",
    "this process is known as andreev reflection enhanced transmission ( aet ) @xcite . the second case of positive cross correlation",
    "can be observed for one bias voltage being close to zero and finite bias on the second electrode . in this case",
    ", car dominates over single electron transmission and induces positive cross correlation @xcite .",
    "+        this picture changes dramatically if we go over to the case of full polarisation ( @xmath83 ) and finite spin - active scattering .",
    "since aet relies on double ar , and consequently the spin symmetry of ar , it must dissapear since sar violates spin - symmetry and it would be the only possible charge transfer process for a single lead for @xmath83 .",
    "however , for @xmath84 a positive cross correlation remains .",
    "this is exactly the position where we assume scar to be dominant since @xmath84 means that single electron transfer between the ferromagnets does not occur .",
    "+ the effect is , of course , still observable for @xmath85 but the polarisation should be rather strong .",
    "spin - active scattering in superconductor - ferromagnet hybrids is a general phenomenon @xcite and full polarisation was just assumed for clarity .",
    "therefore , we believe that scar is a generic phenomenon that should also be present in superconductor ferromagnet beamsplitters with tunnel contacts @xcite or chaotic cavities @xcite since its origin does not lie in the precise form of the energy dependence of the transmission coefficients",
    ". + experiments in the direction of the above described proposal have already been realized @xcite .",
    "multi - terminal hybrid systems with embedded quantum dots @xcite also based on inas nanowires @xcite have already been realised experimentally . in such devices a new subgap structure has been observed that can be explained by sar @xcite .",
    "this is of special importance , since in our consideration we did not include effects of coulomb interaction on the dot and so we should worry about a possible a suppression of scar .",
    "the mean field analysis of @xcite , however , revealed that sar and therefore also scar should be observable also in presence of strong coulomb interaction .",
    "apart from that , we can argue that also in interacting systems characteristic resonances , as the one of the resonant level considered here , are present and have a characteristic location and width associated with interactions",
    ". therefore the general scenario should be robust .",
    "however , one should mind that for more extended quantum dots or nanowires disorder could play an important role as mentioned in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another experiment has realized a superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor junction based on al and co electrodes with two closely spaced cobalt wires bridging two aluminum electrodes @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the resistancee in the case of antiparallel and parallel magnetisation of the two wires has been measured and for low temperatures it has been found that the antiparallel arrangement may even have higher resistance than the parallel one giving reliable evidence for spin - active scattering being present in the device . concerning a possible experimental realisation using quantum dots one should mind that interaction should be small enough and the polarisation large enough to not completely suppress scar and the coupling to the leads should be of the order of the superconductor gap @xmath86 . nowadays , this coupling is generically obtained in experiments using inas nanowires or carbon nanotubes as quantum dots @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we have first considered superconductor ferromagnet beamsplitters without a specific consideration of interface properties .",
    "we found that splitting of spin - polarized p - wave cooper pairs can easily be identified in the conductance .",
    "however , p - wave superconductors that are usable in experiments are not available but we proposed a scheme to mimic its behavior by taking into account the spin - activity of superconductor - ferromagnet interfaces .",
    "the newly identified scar process allows to obtain split p - wave cooper pairs which gives access to the bell states other than @xmath87 .",
