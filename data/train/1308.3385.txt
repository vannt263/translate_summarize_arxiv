    "rounds _ , with the cops going first in round @xmath6 and then playing alternate time - steps . the cops and robber occupy vertices ; for simplicity , we often identify the player with the vertex they occupy .",
    "we refer to the set of cops as @xmath7 and the robber as @xmath8 when a player is ready to move in a round they must move to a neighbouring vertex . because of the loops , players can _ pass _ , or remain on their own vertex . observe that any subset of @xmath7 may move in a given round .",
    "the cops win if after some finite number of rounds , one of them can occupy the same vertex as the robber ( in a reflexive graph , this is equivalent to the cop landing on the robber ) .",
    "this is called a _ capture_. the robber wins if he can evade capture indefinitely",
    ". a _ winning strategy for the cops _ is a set of rules that if followed , result in a win for the cops .",
    "a _ winning strategy for the robber _ is defined analogously .",
    "cops and robbers is often called a _",
    "vertex - pursuit game _ on graphs , for reasons that should now be apparent to the reader .",
    "if we place a cop at each vertex , then the cops are guaranteed to win .",
    "therefore , the minimum number of cops required to win in a graph @xmath0 is a well - defined positive integer , named the _ cop number _ ( or _ copnumber _ ) of the graph @xmath9 we write @xmath10 for the cop number of a graph @xmath11 .",
