    "the dynamics of a particle that interacts with its environment constitutes a basic problem in physics .",
    "classically , upon elimination of the environmental degrees of freedom , the reduced dynamics is most simply described in terms of langevin equation .",
    "solution of this equation , by utilizing fokker planck equation , is well known @xcite . in the absence of external potential",
    ", it yields spreading and diffusion .",
    "the latter effect is due to the interplay of noise and dissipation .",
    "however , diffusion may arise also from the interaction with disordered environment .",
    "this kind of non - dissipative `` random - walk '' diffusion is encountered , for example , in solid state physics , while analyzing electrical conductivity .",
    "it is well known @xcite that this latter type of diffusion may be suppressed quantum mechanically due to localization effect .",
    "still , diffusive - like behavior is recovered if noise and dissipation are taken into account .",
    "the unified modeling of the environment in terms of noise , dissipation and disorder is the first stage of the present study .",
    "one may take the notion of particle literally , and identify the environment as either external or internal bath that consists of infinitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "the bath may be a large collection of other particles or field modes ( photons , phonons ) .",
    "else , the internal degrees of freedom of the particle itself are considered to be the bath .",
    "the latter point of view has been suggested by gross @xcite in order to analyze inelastic scattering of heavy ions .    a totally different point of view , promoted by caldeira and leggett ( cl ) @xcite ,",
    "consider the notion of particle as a token for some macroscopic degree of freedom .",
    "a linear interaction with a speculated bath that consists of infinitely many uncoupled harmonic oscillators , is assumed ( zwanzig @xcite ) .",
    "the known classical limit , namely langevin - type equation , serves as a guide for the construction of the proper hamiltonian .",
    "( phenomenological rather than microscopic considerations are used , hence the usage of the term ` speculated bath ' ) .",
    "the power inherent in this approach is the capability to introduce an explicit path integral expression for the propagator , using the feynman vernon ( fv ) @xcite formalism .",
    "this fv - cl propagator constitutes a quantized description of brownian motion ( bm ) .",
    "the term `` bm - model '' will be associated from now on with this propagator .",
    "the first question which should be asked concerning the applicability of cl approach is obviously whether either the coupling , the bath , or both are `` too simple '' in order to account for the variety of physical phenomena that are associated with generalized bm .",
    "the term `` generalized bm '' is used in order to describe any dynamical behavior that corresponds in the classical limit to langevin - like equation . in the simplest case langevin equation is @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the mass and the friction coefficient , respectively .",
    "one should specify the stochastic force @xmath3 .",
    "this force may arise from interaction with some fluctuating homogeneous field ( @xmath4 ) , which is the usual formulation .",
    "however , _ more generally _ , this force may arise from the interaction with _ disordered _ potential ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "in the latter case the spatial auto - correlations of the force are significant .",
    "to avoid misunderstanding it should be emphasized that there are other aspects in which bm can be generalized ( for review see @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we construct a unified model for the study of diffusion , localization and dissipation ( dld ) .",
    "this model describes generalized bm in the sense specified above .",
    "the disordered environment may be either static ( quenched ) , noisy or dynamical .",
    "the model is treated within the framework of the fv formalism .",
    "the resultant path integral expression for the propagator contains a functional @xmath6 with kernel @xmath7 that corresponds to friction , and a functional @xmath8 with kernel @xmath9 that corresponds to the noise .",
    "both functionals depend also on a suitably defined auto - correlation function @xmath10 that characterizes the disorder .",
    "bm model constitutes ( formally ) a special case where the disorder auto - correlation length is taken to be infinite .",
    "optional derivations of the resultant path integral expression are presented for the particular cases of either classical or quantal systems with non - dynamical disordered potential .",
    "obviously , in the latter case the friction functional @xmath6 is not generated by the derivation .",
    "localization problem is obtained if the noise auto - correlation time is taken to be infinite ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "an explicit computation of both the classical and the quantal propagators @xmath12 will be carried out .",
    "this propagator generates the time evolution of @xmath13 , which is either the wigner function or the corresponding classical phase - space distribution . spreading and diffusion profiles are found for either noisy or ohmic environment .",
    "quantal corrections to the classical result are discussed . a new strategy is developed in order to handle the integration over paths .",
    "this strategy is utilized in order to study the anomalous `` diffusion '' profiles due to colored noise .",
    "later it is extended in order to demonstrate how localization comes out from the path integral expression .",
    "again , one may ask , whether the dld model is the `` ultimate '' model for the description of bm in the most generalized way ( as far as generic effects are concerned ) . in case of 2-d generalized bm",
    "one should consider also the effect of `` geometric magnetism '' @xcite , which is not covered by the 1-d dld model . here",
    "we limit the discussion to 1-d bm . in order to answer this question one should consider a general nonlinear coupling to a thermal , possibly chaotic bath . in the limit of weak coupling one",
    "may demonstrate ( see sec.vi(b ) ) that indeed the bath can be replaced by an equivalent `` effective bath '' that consists of harmonic oscillators , yielding the dld model .",
    "a further reduction to bm model is achieved if the coupling is linear .",
    "the derivation also demonstrates why the so called `` ohmic '' bath is generic .",
    "however , we can not prove that the path - integral expression that corresponds to the dld model is the most generalized description of bm ( in the sense of this paper ) .",
    "gefen and thouless @xcite , wilkinson @xcite and shimshoni and gefen @xcite have emphasized the significance of landau - zener transitions as a mechanism for dissipation .",
    "the weak coupling approximation misses this effect . still , there is a possibility that some future , more sophisticated derivation , will demonstrate that an equivalent `` oscillators bath '' can be defined also in the case of strong coupling .",
    "the existence of such derivation is most significant , since it implies that no `` new effects '' ( such as `` geometric magnetism '' in case of 2-d generalized bm ) can be found in the context of 1-d generalized bm .",
    "referring again to the landau - zener mechanism , wilkinson has demonstrated that anomalous friction , which is not proportional to velocity , may arise @xcite .",
    "the bm model can not generate such anomalous effect .",
    "however , we shall demonstrate that the _ non - ohmic _ dld model can be used in order to generate this effect .",
    "we turn to review previous works that are related to the present study .",
    "traditional approach to the study of dissipation is based on the master equation formalism @xcite , which is the quantal analog of the classical fokker planck treatment @xcite .",
    "systematic derivations are usually based , in some stage , on the markovian approximation .",
    "an alternative route is to apply the fv formalism @xcite .",
    "this has been done by mhring and smilansky @xcite , following gross @xcite , in order to study deep inelastic collisions of heavy ions .",
    "later , the fv formalism has been applied by cl @xcite and followers @xcite in particular to the study of macroscopic quantum tunneling .",
    "hakim and ambegaokar @xcite has applied fv model in order to compute the spreading and the diffusion of quantum brownian particle .",
    "cohen and fishman @xcite have computed the full wigner propagator in case of general quadratic hamiltonian , possibly time dependent .",
    "the latter study has demonstrated more clearly the significance of _ noise time - autocorrelations_. non - trivial auto - correlations may lead to non - markovian effects due to the non - local ( in time ) nature of the noise functional @xmath8 .",
    "the simplest example is the suppression of diffusion at low temperatures @xcite due to negative power - law correlations of the noise @xcite .",
    "a less trivial manifestation of non - markovian effect has been found by cohen @xcite while analyzing diffusion due to the destruction of localization by colored noise .",
    "non markovian features are usually speculated to be less relevant if disorder is taken into account .",
    "one may expect that for generalized bm , disorder will lead , at all temperatures , to normal diffusion .",
    "we shall find later in this paper that non - markovian effects are quite effective also in case of the dld model , and lead to anomalous spreading profiles .",
    "however , it will be clear that these effects , though counter intuitive at first sight , are of classical nature . non markovian effects can also arise from the non - locality of the friction functional @xmath6 , this is the case for non - ohmic bath .",
    "the retarded response of the bath has then long memory for the particle s dynamics , see for example the review papers by grabert et al . and by hnggi et al .",
    "in particular , for unbounded motion , in the absence of disorder ( bm model ) , it will be demonstrated that one encounters infinities in computations of the friction and of the effective mass .",
    "these infinities are avoided if disorder is taken into account ( sec.iv(b ) ) .",
    "the suppression of quantal interference due to dephasing process is an important issue for both semiclassical @xcite and mesoscopic @xcite physics .",
    "the dephasing of interference in metals due to electromagnetic fluctuations has been discussed by altshuler , aronov and khmelnitskii @xcite .",
    "general considerations has been presented by stern , aharonov and imry @xcite .",
    "the strong dimensionality dependence of the dephasing process has been emphasized . in this paper , the dld model",
    "is used in order to study the suppression of quantal interference due to the local interaction with either noisy or dynamical _ disordered _ environment .",
    "the dephasing is determined by the noise functional @xmath14 $ ] . due to the local nature of the dephasing process",
    ", the decay of coherence is exponential in time , and no longer depends on geometrical considerations .    in case of quenched disordered environment",
    "the dld model reduces to a localization problem that its solution is well known @xcite . in particular , for @xmath15 correlated potential the result for the localization length has been pointed out by thouless @xcite . as far as we know ,",
    "the real - time feynman path integral formalism has not been utilized so far in order to re - derive this result , though functional integration is frequently employed in closely related computations .",
    "the case of noisy disordered environment , where the potential is @xmath15 correlated both in time and in space has been considered by jayannavar and kumar @xcite . in the latter reference",
    "the spatial spreading has been computed , and a classical - like result has been obtained .",
    "quantal corrections to the dispersion profile , has not been discussed in the latter reference .",
    "no solution exists for a model that `` interpolates '' the crossover from quenched noise , via colored noise , to white noise disordered potential .",
    "marianer and deutsch @xcite have considered the problem of white noisy disordered potential with added dissipation .",
    "using bm model , they have demonstrated that a classical - like results is obtained for the spatial spreading .",
    "again , neither the spreading profile nor quantal corrections have been considered .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows :   in sec.ii the unified model for the study of diffusion , localization and dissipation ( dld ) is constructed .",
    "derivation of the reduced classical dynamics is presented in sec.iii-iv .",
    "it is shown that a well defined langevin equation is obtained for both subohmic and superohmic bath , as well as for ohmic bath .",
    "this is contrasted with bm model , where only the ohmic case is well defined . in sec.v - vi ,",
    "four derivations of the fv path integral expression for the propagator are presented : ( a ) a classical derivation that is based on langevin equation ; ( b ) a quantum mechanical derivation for non - dynamical noisy or quenched disordered potential ; ( c ) a quantum mechanical derivation for the full dld model ; ( d ) a quantal derivation for the general case of weak nonlinear coupling to a thermal , possibly chaotic bath .",
    "app.a clarifies the relation of bm - model and dld - model to the case of interaction with external bath that consists of extended field modes . in sec.vi(c ) the explicit expression for the influence functional allows concrete predictions concerning the loss of interference due to dephasing .",
    "app.b introduce a gedanken experiment that clarifies the manifestation of interference and dephasing in the presence of dynamical disordered environment . in sec.vii-viii three strategies for the computation of the quantal propagator",
    "are discussed . spreading and diffusion profiles are found for either noisy or ohmic environment .",
    "the dld model is compared with the bm model . in the latter case",
    "the result is classical - like , while in case of the dld model , a singular `` quantal correction '' should be included .",
    "the significance of this `` correction '' is further clarified in app.b .",
    "the strategy of sec.viii , which enables computation of diffusion profiles in the presence of _ colored _ noise , is extended in sec.ix .",
    "we use this strategy in order to demonstrate how , in the case of _ quenched _ noise , localization comes out from the general fv path integral expression .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in sec.x .",
    "as a starting point for later generalization we consider the classical langevin equation .",

    "the standard langevin equation can be _",
    "generalized _ by assuming that the stochastic force is due to some noisy potential , namely @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes spatial derivative .",

    "langevin equation predicts rigid motion with no diffusion . this feature is eliminated if an average over realizations of @xmath3 is performed .",
    "the _ standard _ langevin equation can be viewed as a special case of the _ generalized _ version ( [ e2_3 ] ) . for",

    "the resultant motion will be diffusive - like rather than rigid , even without averaging over realizations .",
    "it is crucial to do this important observation if one wishes to introduce a _ quantized _ version of langevin equation .      disregarding the friction term ,",
    "the langevin equation may be derived from the hamiltonian @xmath33 where average over realizations of @xmath20 is implicit .",
    "if @xmath20 is time independent , we shall use the notion _ quenched _ disordered environment .",
    "if @xmath20 is uncorrelated also in time , we shall use the notion _ noisy _ environment .",
    "if @xmath2 is non - zero , energy may dissipate , and we should consider `` dynamical '' environment rather than `` noisy '' or `` quenched '' one . in order to model the environment we generalize the fv - cl approach .",
    "namely , to facilitate later mathematical treatment , the interaction potential is assumed to be linear in the bath coordinates : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the dynamical coordinate of the @xmath36 scatterer or bath mode .",
    "@xmath37 is the normalized interaction potential , and @xmath38 are coupling constants . in case of dynamical environment ,",
    "the @xmath39 are assumed to be oscillators coordinates .",
    "the bath hamiltonian is : @xmath40 the total hamiltonian of the system plus the heat bath is @xmath41 in order to further specify the dld model , we should characterize the spectral distribution of the bath - oscillators , as well as their interaction with the particle @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we consider the case of localized scatterers .",
    "the scatterers are assumed to be uniformly distributed in space with @xmath42 .",
    "the joint distribution of the bath oscillators with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 is assumed to be factorized .",
    "consequently we can write @xmath45 the bath is characterized by the spectral function @xmath46 .",
    "if we consider a partition of the bath oscillators into subsets of oscillators whose positions @xmath44 are the same , then locally , within each subset , the @xmath43 will have the same distribution .",
    "the interaction is characterized by well defined spatial autocorrelation function @xmath47 , namely @xmath48 where `` density '' refers to the uniform spatial distribution @xmath49 .",
    "the scattering potential @xmath50 will be normalized so that @xmath27 , the normalization constant being absorbed in the coefficients @xmath38 . disregarding for a moment the dynamical nature of the bath , thus considering again the case of either `` noisy '' or `` quenched '' environment , one obtains @xmath51 which upon recalling previous definitions , leads to ( [ e2_4 ] ) with @xmath52  . thus , if the dynamical nature of the bath is ignored , the problem reduces to solving langevin equation with the appropriate @xmath47 and @xmath53 .",
    "the spectral function @xmath46 and the spatial autocorrelation function @xmath26 constitute a complete specification of the model hamiltonian ( [ e3_4 ] ) .",
    "this hamiltonian will be used in order to study diffusion localization and dissipation ( dld ) within the framework of a unified formalism .",
    "the bm model , where @xmath54 up to normalization , constitutes _ formally _ a special case of the dld model .",
    "it will be possible to apply the `` unified '' formalism that will be developed for the dld model , also for the analysis of the bm model , merely by substitution of the appropriate @xmath26 .",
    "namely , one may use @xmath26 of ( [ e2_5 ] ) , or alternatively one may take the limit @xmath55 in ( [ e2_6 ] ) . however , there are some minor , but significant differences that will be noted in due time .",
    "this is because our derivations rely on the _ local _ nature of @xmath26 .",
    "therefore we consider the notion `` bm model '' distinctively from the notion `` dld model '' .",
    "also the results will be both qualitatively and quantitatively different , in - spite of being derived , formally , from look - alike formulas .",
    "fig.[models ] illustrates the bm hamiltonian and the dld hamiltonian .",
    "looking at the figure it is apparent that the natural application of the bm model is for the description of the dynamics of a composite particle , with many internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this interpretation is due to gross ref.@xcite , who suggested to apply such models for the analysis of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the bath according to this interpretation is `` internal '' , carried by the particle , rather than `` external '' .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian ( [ e3_2 ] ) may also describe the interaction with some `` external '' bath that consists of extended field modes .",
    "for example , the electron - photon interaction and the electron - phonon interaction may be cast into the form of ( [ e3_2 ] ) , with @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is either the speed of light or the speed of sound . in the long wavelength limit",
    "this interaction resembles the bm - model rather than the dld - model . with minor modifications ,",
    "also these models may be treated within the framework of our `` unified '' treatment ( appendix a ) .",
    "finally , we re - emphasize that in general , the dld model as well as the bm model may be used on a phenomenological basis for the description of dissipation in mesoscopic quantum devices .",
    "this point of view will be discussed further later on ( sec.vi(b ) in particular ) .",
    "the quantal state of the particle may be represented by wigner function @xmath58 .",
    "the time evolution of wigner function corresponds to that of classical distribution in phase - space . in this section",
    "we consider a ` classical treatment of the dynamics ' .",
    "the latter term implies that the system is considered to be classical , ( @xmath59 ) , while the bath gets full quantum mechanical treatment .",
    "the limit @xmath60 is not taken .",
    "the equations of motion of classical points that form a distribution in phase - space are and @xmath61 the variables @xmath62 satisfy the equation @xmath63 which can be solved explicitly , namely , @xmath64 substitution of the latter expression into ( [ e4_1 ] ) yields @xmath65 with @xmath66 the response kernel @xmath67 is defined for positive times ( @xmath68 ) as follows : @xmath69    in order to make further progress , a specification of the initial state of the system plus the bath is needed .",

    "all these phenomena may be derived from the general path integral expression ( [ e6_7 ] ) , @xmath490 }   \\ \\ \\mbox{e}^{-\\frac{1}{\\hbar^2}s_n[r , r ] } \\ \\ \\ \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] upon inclusion of the appropriate functionals @xmath491 and @xmath8 .",
    "general expressions for these functionals are available and various limits may be considered : ( a ) quantal versus classical expressions ; ( b ) disordered versus non - disordered environment ; ( c ) dissipative versus non - dissipative environment ; ( d ) quenched versus noisy environment . in the classical limit",
    "the dld model constitutes a formal solution of langevin equation .",
    "the classical limit may be obtained by linearization of the quantal @xmath307 $ ] with respect to @xmath284 , while expanding @xmath306 $ ] to be quadratic in this path - variable .",
    "the disorder or its absence depends on the choice of the spatial auto - correlation function @xmath26 . the dissipation is turned on if the friction functional @xmath6 is included in @xmath491 .",
    "the nature of the noise , whether it is `` quenched '' , `` colored '' or `` white '' , is determined by the noise kernel @xmath28 . in the latter case any combination may be considered as well ( see further discussion at the end of this section ) .",
    "the classical bm model is well defined in terms of an appropriate langevin equation only in the case of an ohmic bath .",
    "this is not the case with the classical dld model .",
    "the classical dynamics in the latter case is well defined in terms of appropriate langevin equation also for non - ohmic bath .",
    "explicit expressions for the friction force , and for the effective mass have been derived .",
    "another nice feature of the dld model is the absence of `` switching impulse '' .    once the noise auto - correlation function @xmath28 is specified , the bm model is in - distinguishable from its classical limit .",
    "as long as the external potential @xmath219 is quadratic ( at most ) , the quantal propagator is identical with the classical one , and langevin equation can be used in order to describe correctly the time evolution of wigner function .",
    "all the quantal effects that are associated with the standard zwanzig - caldeira - leggett bm - model are ( formally ) reproduced by solving the classical langevin equation with an appropriate noise term . _",
    "the dld model is different_. the non - stochastic , genuine quantal features of the dld model have been discussed .",
    "these features constitute a manifestation of either the disorder or the chaotic nature of the bath .    for either noisy or ohmic environment both the bm model and",
    "the dld model leads to either spreading or diffusion . for the bm model ,",
    "the spreading and the diffusion profiles are described by a gaussian distribution . for",
    "the dld model one should include a quantal correction .",
    "the disorder freezes a piece of the wavepacket , letting it to propagate as if it were a free particle . both , the `` quantal correction '' to the propagator , as well as any other interference phenomena , die out exponentially in time .",
    "this exponential decay , due to dephasing , is independent of geometry .",
    "_ it should be contrasted _ with the results for loss of interference in the presence of bm - like environment @xcite .",
    "another important observation is that for _ disordered _ environment , quantal interference is unaffected by friction .    on the classical level",
    "it is fascinating to analyze the diffusion profile in the presence of disorder . for the low temperature ohmic bm - model , it is found that diffusion is suppressed , though its gaussian profile is maintained .",
    "the dld model , in the same circumstances , leads to an exponential profile that does not change with time .",
    "this new effect is due to the interplay of the temporal ( negative ) autocorrelations of the noise with the spatial disorder .",
    "even more fascinating `` diffusion '' profiles are found for other types of noise autocorrelations .",
    "quenched disorder in _ one dimension _",
    "leads to classical localization , as well as to quantal localization .",
    "the former is characterized by a localization length which is exponentially large at high energies .",
    "quantal localization on the other hand is dominated by interference phenomenon .",
    "we have identified the interference paths within the framework of fv formalism , and demonstrated how the well known exponential profile emerges .",
    "the localization length in the quantal case is proportional to the square of the velocity .",
    "the applicability of this result to other dispersion relations has been pointed out .",
    "it is obvious from the derivation , that localization can not be argued if the noise is not strictly static ( e.g. slowly modulated ) .",
    "diffusive behavior is recovered if the noise possess long but _",
    "finite _ auto - correlation time . also",
    "the case of white noise `` on top '' of the static disorder will evidently lead to diffusion @xcite@xcite . in this latter case , which has not been considered in this paper , non",
    "perturbative effects may manifest themselves @xcite as in the case of the `` quantum kicked particle '' @xcite .",
    "the dld model should also account for diffusion in the presence of both quenched disorder , noisy potential and friction ( all together ) .",
    "there should be a way to derive systematically well known heuristic results that corresponds to hopping , or variable range hopping @xcite .",
    "classical non - dissipative `` random walk '' diffusion has been discussed in the restricted case of long - time correlated noise .",
    "it is essential to generalize the dld model to _ more than one dimension _ in order to account for this phenomenon in the case of strictly static disorder .",
    "auto - correlations of the disordered potential , both in time and in space , should be considered , in order to generate the dynamics which is described by boltzmann transport equation . in the limit of quenched disorder , localization effect should be encountered .",

    "the research reported here was supported in part by the minerva center for nonlinear physics of complex systems .",
    "this appendix illustrates how the unified formalism that has been presented in this paper should be modified in order to deal with external bath that consists of extended field modes . unlike the case of the bm - model ,",
    "this modification is not as immediate as the mere substitution of appropriate @xmath26 . in the present derivation",
    "the bath hamiltonian is not specified , and also the assumption @xmath492 is altered .",
    "for the standard derivation of the dld model it has been assumed that the interaction hamiltonian is ( [ e3_2 ] ) with @xmath492 , leading to the factorized noise auto - correlation function ( [ e2_4 ] ) . in the more general case",
    "the classical derivation as well as the quantal derivations lead to a stochastic force that satisfies ( [ e2_3 ] ) or to the noise functional ( [ e6_11 ] ) respectively , with noise auto - correlation function which is @xmath493 here @xmath494  , and the interaction hamiltonian ( [ e3_2 ] ) is used with @xmath495 without loss of generality .",
    "the fields mode are still assumed to be decoupled , but the bath hamiltonian is not specified . instead , one relys on fluctuation - dissipation theorem as in ref.@xcite , writing the general expression : @xmath496 \\ \\ \\ \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that if the field modes are simple harmonic oscillators , then one should substitute @xmath497 .",
    "alternatively , one may speculate @xmath498 using known response characteristics of the bath .    to make further progress the interaction hamiltonian ( [ e3_2 ] ) should be further specified .",
    "using `` standing waves '' decomposition it is assumed to be @xmath499 substitution of the appropriate @xmath500 into ( [ ea_phi ] ) , and converting the summation to an integral over directions and over @xmath501 , the result can be cast into the following form @xmath502 the average over directions can be performed leading to @xmath503 in 1-d , bessel function @xmath504 in 2-d , and @xmath505 in 3-d .    in ref.@xcite the interaction with electromagnetic fluctuations in metal has been considered .",

    "it corresponds to @xmath506 . due to this assumption",

    "it is assumed that @xmath508 , where @xmath509 is the charge of the electron and @xmath510 is the conductivity .",
    "integration over @xmath501 leads to the result @xmath511   \\ \\ \\ \\   \\mbox{for $ d \\le 2 $ } \\ .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result , that has been obtained in ref.@xcite ( equation ( 7.8 ) there ) , is very similar to the corresponding result ( [ e_supp ] ) for the bm - model , the difference being the power @xmath512 which is not universal .",
    "an apparently simpler example for an interaction with external bath that consists of extended field modes , is the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "here we want to question the applicability of the bm model as an approximated description .",
    "the electron is assumed to be confined to a one dimensional `` quantum wire '' , while the phonons dwell in the 3-d bulk .",
    "considering longitudinal modes , the coupling of the @xmath513 `` oscillator '' with the electron is @xmath514 , with a coupling constant @xmath515 . summing over @xmath36 , as defined in ( [ e3_5 ] ) , one obtains effectively @xmath516 where @xmath517 is the dimensionality of the space where the phonons dwell .",
    "thus a phonons - bath is similar to a superohmic bm - model .",
    "however , this derivation is somewhat miss - leading , since a cutoff @xmath149 should be introduced , while for the original electron - phonon interaction a natural cutoff @xmath518 exists .",
    "in this appendix we consider the interference phenomenon from two different points of view , and demonstrate their consistency .",
    "first we consider the free propagation of two - wavepackets superposition .",
    "the decay of the interference pattern will be dictated by the propagator ( [ e9_2 ] ) .",
    "then we consider the scattering of a simple wavepacket from a double - barrier .",
    "the suppression of interference paths will be dictated by the noise functional ( sec.vi(c ) ) .",
    "finally , we argue that both points of view are physically equivalent , and must lead to the _ same _ result , which is indeed the case .    consider a superposition of two gaussian wavepackets which have the same momentum @xmath519 , the same initial spatial spreading @xmath520 , while their initial locations satisfies @xmath521 .",
    "the wigner function for this preparation is easily computed , and is of the form @xmath522 where @xmath523 denotes `` minimum - uncertainty '' gaussian distribution , and @xmath524 . for free propagation",
    "@xmath525 will develop fringes on the spatial scale @xmath526 .",
    "note that this gedanken experiment is formally equivalent to the usual `` two slit '' diffraction experiment upon the definition @xmath527 .",
    "for propagation in noisy non - disordered environment the interference pattern is smeared on scale @xmath528 , due to the diffusive momentum spreading .",
    "the smearing factor is @xmath529 $ ] leading to an exponential decay @xmath530 $ ] , that depends on the separation @xmath531 .",
    "on the other hand , for propagation in noisy disordered environment , using ( [ e9_2 ] ) , the exponential decay is @xmath532 $ ] , independent of geometry .",
    "consider now scattering problem in one dimension .",
    "the potential is assumed to be @xmath533 for @xmath534 , and @xmath535 for @xmath536 .",
    "a simple gaussian wavepacket with momentum @xmath537 and spatial spreading @xmath538 is launched from @xmath405 .",
    "the scattered particle is detected at the range @xmath185 which is assumed to be much larger than @xmath405 . in the absence of noise and dissipation , it is not difficult to work out the explicit solution of this scattering problem .",
    "a `` train '' of gaussian - like wavepackets will emerge from the scattering region .",
    "the spatial separation between each two wavepackets is @xmath531 , and the probability density function will contain interference pattern in between . from the fv path - integral point of view ( sec.vi(c ) ) , the interference pattern is due to the existence of `` interference paths '' . in the presence of noisy disordered environment the contribution of these interference paths to the propagator",
    "is suppressed exponentially in time .",
    "assuming that the dephasing during the time interval @xmath539 is negligible , one may use the results of the first gedanken experiment , leading to the same exponential decay .",
    "thus , the result ( [ e9_2 ] ) for the propagator is consistent with the analysis of interference in sec.vi(c ) .",
    "our gedanken experiment can be used also in order to illustrate and clarify the observation that friction does not affect the interference phenomenon .",
