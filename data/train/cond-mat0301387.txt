    "antiferromagnetism ( af ) appears in the hubbard and related models for an arbitrary interaction strength @xmath0 provided we are close to the half - filled - band situation ( @xmath1 in the orbitally nondegenerate case ) @xcite .",
    "this is easy to understand qualitatively , since the intraatomic hubbard interaction @xmath2 is diminished by keeping apart the electrons with the opposite spins . in the strong - correlation limit",
    "@xcite this interaction leads to an antiferromagnetic kinetic exchange for an arbitrary band filling @xmath3 . at the same time , the band energy is not increased because the concomitant nesting condition for the quasiparticle states achievable for bipartite lattices only leads to the energy decrease of the occupied states , even when going beyond the hartree - fock picture . in effect , the regime of the band filling @xmath4 for which the af state is stable at given @xmath0 has been determined for variety of theoretical approaches @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the reliability of the results for the half - filled case is not in question as long as they reduce to those in the hartree - fock and to the mean - field ( heisenberg ) approximations in the weak- and strong - correlation limits , respectively , as we will discuss in the following .",
    "the theoretical results are in accord with the fact that _ all _ known mott insulators with the half - filled band configuration are also antiferromagnetic insulators .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to overview the situation by discussing the crossover behavior from the hartree - fock to the mean - field approximation for the heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "similar , though not equivalent results can be reached within the dynamic mean - field theory ( dmft , see below ) . in the orbitally degenerate situation ( with the degeneracy @xmath5 ) the same type of magnetic(slater ) gap",
    "is generated by an alternant orbital ordering @xcite , as is also discussed at the end of the paper .",
    "explicitly , we concentrate our attention to two specific features of quasiparticle states not elaborated in detail so far , namely , ( i ) an evolution of the magnetic gap ( renormalized by the electronic correlations ) into the mott - hubbard gap , and ( ii ) a rather weak renormalization of the effective mass for the half - filled - band case , which is in contrast with that calculated in the paramagnetic ( para ) case @xcite . a rather strong mass enhancement is retained in the @xmath6 case , in direct analogy to the paramagnetic case @xcite . these results are obtained within the slave - boson approach in the saddle - point approximation , which we compare with the corresponding analysis in the infinite - dimension limit @xcite .",
    "in particular , we introduce the concept of a nonlinear staggered molecular field , which shows up as the effective ( nonlinear - in - magnetization ) magnetic gap , evolving at temperature @xmath7 continuously with increasing @xmath0 from the slater ( hartree - fock ) gap @xmath8 into the hubbard gap . in connection with this evolution , we single out the magnetic and coulomb parts of the localization energy . these particular features",
    "resolve explicitly the old question about the difference between the slater and mott - hubbard insulators in the sense that only the mott - hubbard gap survives when antiferromagnetism disappears ( i.e. above the nel temperature ) .",
    "most of the results are contained in the mathematical formulation established earlier @xcite - @xcite . here , we only discuss those points in an explicit manner .",
    "we believe that these points are relevant to the general physics of correlated systems .",
    "this reason is also behind publishing , perhaps belatedly , such a simple paper .",
    "additionally , since the effective mass is only weakly renormalized for the @xmath9 case and it never reaches zero for @xmath6 , the role of the quantum fluctuations is relatively not as crucial as for the discussion of the paramagnetic state .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide the analytic details of the af solution , which are followed by the numerical analysis ( section iii ) and the discussion in physical terms in section iv , where we also compare the results with those for a doubly degenerate - band case for @xmath9 .",
    "to stress the role of the molecular field coming from the electronic correlations , we start from the extended hubbard model , with intersite exchange interactions included , i.e. write @xmath10 where the labels @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent two interpenetrable sublattices , each containing half @xmath13 of available atomic sites .",
    "the first term represents single - particle hopping of electrons between the sublattices ( nearest neighbors ) , the second and the third express the intraatomic interaction of the same magnitude on _ all _ sites , the fourth includes the heisenberg exchange between the sublattices , and @xmath14 is the reference energy with @xmath15 being the chemical potential , and @xmath16the total number of fermions .",
    "the heisenberg term has been added only to provide an illustration of the concept of the exchange field coming from the electron correlations ( they will add to one another ) .    in the mean - field ( saddle - point ) approximation for the slave bosons , the rotationally invariant approach of li et al . @xcite and",
    "the original kotliar - ruckenstein @xcite formulations can be brought to an equivalent form @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the six bosons @xmath17 and @xmath18 appearing in the approach fulfill the following five constrains in the mean - field approximation @xmath19 @xmath20 where the subscript @xmath21 characterizes the sublattices , and fermion operators @xmath22and @xmath23 represent the new ( quasiparticle ) fermion operators appearing in the theory .",
    "the effective hamiltonian in the saddle - point approximation takes the form in reciprocal ( @xmath24 ) * *  * * space @xmath25 where @xmath26 contains the constraints appearing in the theory in the form of lagrange multipliers @xmath27 +   \\notag \\\\ & \\frac{n}{2}\\lambda ^{(1b)}\\left ( e^{2}+d^{2}+p_{b\\uparrow } ^{2}+p_{b\\downarrow } ^{2}-1\\right ) -   \\notag \\\\ & \\frac{n}{2}\\left [ \\lambda _ { \\uparrow } ^{(2b)}\\left ( p_{b\\uparrow } ^{2}+d^{2}\\right ) + \\lambda _ { \\downarrow } ^{(2b)}\\left ( p_{b\\downarrow } ^{2}+d^{2}\\right ) \\right ]   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the summation over ( @xmath24 * * ) * * comprises the states in the halved brillouin zone and @xmath28 is the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to the constraint ( [ con1 ] ) and , since they are spin symmetric we can put @xmath31 the spin - dependent lagrange multipliers @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent spin - resolved constraint ( [ con2 ] ) . in the antiferromagnetic",
    "( af ) case the magnetic moments @xmath34 @xmath35 have the opposite sign , i.e. @xmath36 this means that the constraints @xmath37 obey the relations @xmath38 the narrowing factor @xmath39 renormalizing the bare band energy @xmath40 assumes the form @xmath41    the hamiltonian ( [ hf ] ) can be diagonalized with the help of the bogolyubov transformation @xcite . in effect , the free energy functional of the system ( per atom ) takes the form @xmath42",

    "the quantity @xmath48 plays a role of the correlation induced molecular field , since it adds to the effective heisenberg field @xmath49 in the case @xmath50 ( taken in the numerical analysis ) @xmath51 constitutes the entire gap induced by the magnetic ordering ( it is the _",
    "magnetic _ gap ) . on the whole , the first two terms in ( [ hb ] )",
    "provide the contribution to the thermodynamics coming from the single particle excitations in the magnetic ( slater ) subbands caused by af ordering and having energies @xmath52 these quasiparticle energies comprise the effective band narrowing or the mass renormalization @xmath53 and the molecular field @xmath54 both to be determined in a self - consistent manner detailed below . the field @xmath51 arises from the local constraint ( [ con2 ] ) .",
    "thus , one can say that the molecular field is induced by the correlations .",
    "the functional ( [ hb ] ) must be minimized with respect to all appearing bose fields and the chemical potential @xmath55 effectively , one can reduce ( [ hb ] ) to the form with two variables @xmath56 and @xmath18 . for the purpose of simplicity and clarity of our points",
    "we take constant density of states @xmath57 for @xmath58 for which the ground state energy takes the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ground - state energy , and @xmath61 in this expression we have already connected @xmath62 to @xmath63via the relation @xmath64 for the sake of completness , we list also the explicit form of the band narrowing factor for @xmath9 : @xmath65 .\\ ] ] note that the variable @xmath66 has a physical meaning of the ratio of the slater gap to the renormalized band energy . in other words , it provides a relative strength of the effective local field with respect to the renormalized kinetic energy . the growing ratio @xmath67 drives the system towards localization induced by the formation of staggered magnetic moments arranged in two sublattices , whereas the growing ratio @xmath68 drives the system towards localization independent of magnetic ordering .",
    "therefore , the present formulation will allow us to single out the contributions coming from the two factors .",
    "the magnetic energy is thus measured with respect to the band energy @xmath69 renormalized by the coulomb interaction .",
    "we now show that the results obtained above provide correctly a mean - field solution in the @xmath72 limit . for the sake of simplicity",
    "consider the half - filled band case with @xmath50 and for symmetric form of the density of states , @xmath73 .",
    "we can then write the ground state energy ( per site ) in the form @xmath74 for large @xmath0 , the gap @xmath75 is also large . in that limit",
    "the energy has the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 . minimizing this expression with respect to @xmath75 we",
    "obtain that @xmath78 minimization with respect to @xmath62 and @xmath79 gives the relations @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 . combining eqs.([m1])-([m3 ] )",
    "we obtain that @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "explicitly , from the fact that @xmath85 and that numerically @xmath86 , we obtain that @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . thus finally , for the featureless form of the density of states we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 in other words , in the @xmath72 limit the hubbard model reduces to the heisenberg model @xcite with the hubbard gap @xmath91 , since in the mean - field approximation the ground - state energy is then given by the kinetic exchange contribution @xcite @xmath92 with @xmath93 . also , the magnetic gap reduces to the atomic value of the hubbard gap , as @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "the hartree - fock @xmath96 limit is recovered once one notices that the method has been constructed to obtain @xmath97 in the weak coupling limit @xcite , @xcite . under that circumstance eq.([eg ] ) reduce to the usual hartree - fock form if we assume that now @xmath98 .",
    "this limit was checked out also numerically , but the results are not reproduced here .",
    "in fig.1 we have displayed both the effective magnetic ( slater - type ) gap @xmath99 and the mott - hubbard gap for the paramagnetic phase , both for @xmath9    [ ptb ]    those characteristics are plotted for the ground state .",
    "the chemical potential is then @xmath100 the mott- hubbard gap is expressed through the difference in the chemical potential in the paramagnetic case @xmath101 for @xmath102(the upper part ) and for @xmath103 ( the lower part ) and was discussed earlier @xcite . for @xmath9 the slater split - band picture appears for arbitrary small @xmath0 and @xmath104 increases with increasing @xmath105 , where @xmath106 . in the limit @xmath107 the gap is composed of the slater and the mott - hubbard parts , and when @xmath108 the former merges gradually with the latter .",
    "this can be seen explicitly in fig.2 ,    [ ptbptb ]    ffig2.eps    where we have shown the ground state energy @xmath109versus @xmath110 in the strong - correlation limit the energy is determined by the kinetic - exchange contribution @xmath111 @xcite , as shown explicitly .",
    "the fitted coefficient @xmath112 to the numerical results can not be attributed to any particular 3d structure , since we have used in numerical calculation a constant value of @xmath113 .",
    "the energies of para- and antiferro - magnetic states merge for @xmath9 and in the @xmath114 limit .",
    "the inset illustrates another interesting characteristic of the solution , namely the magnetic gap _ is not _",
    "proportional to the magnetization , as one would expect from the hartree - fock ( slater ) solution .",
    "in other words , the molecular field @xmath51 is a nonlinear function of @xmath115 since from the condition @xmath116 we obtain the relation @xmath117 @xmath118 this is the reason why the antiferromagnetic gap for almost localized fermions can not be regarded as just the slater gap . also , the af solution disappears at the critical band filling @xmath119    to visualize the difference between the magnetic gap and the magnetization we have plotted in fig.3 both quantities as a function of the interaction strength @xmath120 @xmath35for different band filling parameter @xmath121    [ ptb ]    ffig3.eps    while for @xmath9 the magnetic moment saturates gradually with growing @xmath122 @xmath104 keeps increasing .",
    "the magnetic gap for @xmath9 increases and eventually @xmath123 ; this circumstance indicates again that the magnetic gap merges with the hubbard gap , which can be estimated analytically and is @xmath124 @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "the double occupancy probability @xmath127 is shown in fig.4 for different band fillings .",
    "[ ptb ]    ffig4.eps    it decreases continuously with growing @xmath105 , i.e. the charge fluctuations are gradually suppressed , while the magnetic moment grows ( cf .",
    "the difference in the behavior of @xmath128and @xmath129is caused by the circumstance that the @xmath79 is of intraatomic nature , whereas @xmath62 is determined from the competition between the magnetic energy @xmath130 ( also of intraatomic nature ) and the renormalized band energy @xmath131 .",
    "the inset to fig.4 exemplifies the difference between the diminution of @xmath79 with growing @xmath105 for @xmath9 in two situations : for the paramagnetic ( para ) case @xmath132 for @xmath133 this feature is concurrent with the well - known effective mass divergence at the mott - hubbard localization boundary ( the _ brinkman - rice point _ ) .",
    "this divergence _ does not emerge _ in the antiferromagnetic state as @xmath79 approaches zero gradually , in the same manner , as @xmath62 approaches saturation @xmath134    in fig.5 we have displayed the inverse band narrowing factor @xmath135 ( for @xmath136 ) which turns into the effective mass renormalization @xmath137 ( for @xmath138 ) as a function of @xmath139 and for different @xmath140  values .",
    "[ ptb ]    ffig5.eps    again , the inset illustrates the difference with the @xmath9 case .",
    "one should note that the enhancement factor in af state is very small compared to that in para state , which is equal to @xmath141 ^{-1}.\\,\\ $ ] the difference between af and para states diminishes with decreasing @xmath142as in that situation the magnetic moment is reduced rapidly .",
    "so , the weak band narrowing in the @xmath9 case can be associated with the circumstance that the fermi level falls in the gap .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath143 raises rather steeply around @xmath144 .",
    "thus , the appearance of the itinerant antiferromagnetism with an isotropic gap changes the brinkman - rice scenario for the mott - hubbard transition , as it has been underlined before @xcite .",
    "also , the physical parameters @xmath145 and @xmath146 are all of the same magnitude .",
    "this is easy to envisage when estimating e.g. the band narrowing @xmath147 which is in the af state roughly @xmath148 and is of the order of unity .",
    "in fig.6 we have displayed the stability regime @xmath149 of the af phase .",
    "[ ptb ]    ffig6.eps    the full circles has been obtained @xcite in the limit of infinite dimension with the help of quantum monte carlo simulation .",
    "one should note the range of the filling @xmath3 of stable af phase is the broadest for @xmath150 i.e. when the molecular field is the strongest ( cf .",
    "fig.3 ) . note also that the monte - carlo results did note provide the asymptotic behavior for @xmath1 , as it does not reduce correctly to the hartree - fock limit .",
    "for the sake of completeness we display in fig.7 the ground state energy as a function of @xmath105 , for different @xmath151close to the half filling .",
    "[ ptb ]    ffig7.eps    in each case ( for @xmath138 ) the system contains the contribution @xmath152 for @xmath153and the contribution @xmath111 for @xmath154 in other words , the solution interpolates between the hartree - fock and the kinetic exchange limits .",
    "moreover , the shift of the curves with diminishing @xmath155 @xmath3 @xmath35 in the @xmath70 limit is due to the presence of the band term proportional to @xmath156 one should note that in the paramagnetic state the direct coulomb interaction contribution @xmath157 competes with band energy @xmath158 in the antiferromagnetic state the local magnetic contribution @xmath159 is of the opposite sign than the coulomb part .",
    "however , it changes also the band energy . to specify the role of the staggered field we have plotted in fig.8 the difference @xmath160 as a function of @xmath110    [ ptbptb ]",
    "ffig8.eps    the magnetic contribution exceeds the coulomb part for @xmath161 ( i.e. away from the hartree - fock limit ) , and is particularly strong ( and comparable to the band energy ) in the regime @xmath162 where the mott - hubbard localization would take place for the paramagnetic case .",
    "this circumstance indicates why the metal - insulator transition present at @xmath7 in the paramagnetic phase is wiped out when the itinerant af sets in .",
    "simply , the magnetic contribution @xmath163 freezes gradually the spatially separated electrons in the antiferromagnetic phase , taking also advantage of nonvanishing kinetic energy ( the kinetic exchange , @xmath164 , contribution ! ) . in the para phase we have instead a direct competition between band and coulomb energies .    to summarize ,",
    "the mott - localization is achieved gradually at @xmath7 in the af state . in other words ,",
    "the present approach provides a crossover behavior from slater to mott insulator , as shown e.g. in fig.2 .",
    "the same holds true even when we include the intersite exchange @xmath165 which may originate from the quantum gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the continuous evolution with growing @xmath166does not preclude the first order transition at nonzero temperature , as has been demonstrated some time ago for the paramagnetic state @xcite and subsequently reconfirmed in the limit @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "the correlated state builts in gradually with increasing @xmath105 , as can be seen from the gradual increase of the mass enhancement in @xmath168case , i.e. when the ground state is always metallic .",
    "the same holds true for the ground state energy shown in fig.7 .",
    "we have addressed the question of crossover from slater ( hartree - fock ) to mott - hubbard ( atomic ) picture in the half - filled band case , as well as have analyzed the behavior of quasiparticle physical properties in af state in the half- and non half - filled - band cases . although our analysis is based on the saddle - point solution within the slave - boson functional - integral approach , the results can serve as a mean - field analysis , since they interpolate between those in the hartree - fock approximation in the limit @xmath169 and those in mean - field approximation for the heisenberg model ( for @xmath170 in the @xmath72 limit .",
    "they also represent basis for inclusion of gaussian fluctuations @xcite in a magnetically ordered ( af )  state close to the mott - hubbard localization .",
    "however , one should realize that for the half - filled band case the effective mass is only weakly renormalized so the renormalization factor @xmath171 . also , for @xmath172 @xmath173 remains always finite so , perhaps the role of the quantum fluctuations is not as crucial for af state , as it is for the paramagnetic state . in any case , it will be much more involved that in the paramagnetic case @xcite . the full analysis of the mott - hubbard boundary should also include the disordered local - moment phase @xcite , so far not included within the present scheme .",
    "the physical meaning of the results obtained within the slave - boson approach ( sba ) can be characterized as follows .",
    "it is well known @xcite , @xcite - @xcite , @xcite that the saddle point solution of the approach reproduces the results of the gutzwiller approach ( ga ) , as far as the overall ( ground - state ) behavior is concerned .",
    "moreover , sba leads to an improvement of the ga by incorporating both the quasiparticle picture of those systems and the quantum gaussian fluctuations ( not considered in this paper ) . in general , the pseudo - fermion fields @xmath174 representing the quasiparticle states are in one - to - one correspondence to the original fermion fields in the physical fock space .",
    "the mapping is quite obvious within the above analysis .",
    "specifically , the quasiparticle energy @xmath175 leads to the following density of states @xmath176 where @xmath177is the bare density of states in pm phase .",
    "thus the enhancement factor due to the correlations is distinct ( and disappear in the first factor ) from the change of the density of states caused by the appearance of the magnetic gap . by analogy , for the paramagnetic state ( @xmath178 ) , for which @xmath179 can be written as @xmath180 and where the self - energy @xmath181 leads to the mass enhancement @xmath182 we can not single out the factor ( @xmath183 ) in ( [ ro ] ) as the corresponding enhancement also in af state . in the doubly - degenerate - band case ( for @xmath9 ) and under the same - type of approximation scheme , the role of the magnetic gap is played by the gap formed by an alternant orbital ordering in the ferromagnetic state @xcite .",
    "the gap @xmath184 in the latter case is reproduced in fig.9 for the magnitude of the intraatomic ( hunds - rule ) exchange @xmath185 .",
    "again , the gap approaches asymptotically the mott - hubbard gap , which in this case @xcite is equal to @xmath186 .",
    "however , here there is a critical value of @xmath68 , at which the system exhibits antiferromagnetic orbital ordering . in the half - filled case for the doubly degenerate case",
    "@xmath187 the gap appears for an arbitrary small @xmath0 @xcite in the af case and for the critical value of @xmath0 for the paramagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "one should also note that within the present sb  scheme the antiferromagnetic slate - type state ( afs ) evolves for @xmath9 gradually into antiferromagnetic mott ( afi )  state with increasing @xmath68 ratio .",
    "for @xmath138 , we observe only antiferromagnetic metallic ( afm ) state .",
    "this is in contrast with the results obtained with the composite - operator method @xcite , as well as with an original analysis @xcite where a phase border line between itinerant- and localized - staggered moment - bearing phases is drawn .",
    "localized - moment phase for @xmath188 @xmath189 can be obtained only when the polaronic effects due to antiferromagnetic moments surrounding the hole in the mott insulator are included @xcite .",
    "obviously , such asf - afi border line at temperature @xmath190 ( for @xmath9 )  is present @xcite and is induced by the difference in entropy of afs and afi states .",
