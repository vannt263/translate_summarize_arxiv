    "the traditional method of determination of neutrino oscillation parameters requires reconstruction of the neutrino energy for each measured event .",
    "one assumes the target nucleon ( mass @xmath0 ) to be at rest and bound with mean binding energy @xmath1 .",
    "the neutrino energy is then reconstructed from the knowledge of charged lepton kinematics : its scattering angle @xmath2 and energy @xmath3 ( or momentum @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 the interaction is assumed to be quasi - elastic ( qe ) . the methodology presented in the final k2k experiment analysis",
    "is based on likelihood functions , which are dependent on the estimated neutrino energy reconstruction error@xcite .",
    "however at 1 gev energies the nucleon s fermi motion and non - qe interactions introduce significant and difficult to control uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the t2k experiment is a long baseline accelerator muon disappearance experiment held in japan .",
    "its main goal is the precise measurement of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and determination , whether the @xmath8 is nonzero .",
    "the expected error of the @xmath6 is smaller , than 4% and for the @xmath7 is of the order of 1% .",
    "the superkamiokande detector would collect about 1600 @xmath9 cc events / year if there were no oscillation @xcite .",
    "the statistics will be large enough to consider different approaches to extract oscillation parameters and in particular to avoid the neutrino energy reconstruction step .",
    "actually , what we observe in sk are mostly muons and ( sometimes ) pions and all the information about oscillation signal is contained in their distributions .",
    "the problem we address is this : which is optimal strategy ( e.g. statistical estimator and data binning ) to analyse the data ?",
    "our considerations and tests were performed for the t2k beam and super- kamiokande detection power .",
    "the method is based on the monte carlo prediction of muon distribution in the detector .",
    "the events have been produced by the _ nuwro _ neutrino generator@xcite .",
    "the algorithm of oscillation parameter extraction is as follows :    1 .",
    "generate a large number of cc neutrino events with a monte carlo generator for the given neutrino beam ( a typical size of the sample is 1000000 events ) .",
    "2 .   create reference oscillation samples for a set of different parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath10 ) using the muon neutrino survival probability @xmath11 .",
    "3 .   impose detector conditions like _ muon above cherenkov threshold _ , _ no observed pions_. approximate condition for the charged particle being detected is the kinetic energy above the cherenkov threshold .",
    "neutral pions are assumed to be always visible .",
    "4 .   produce independent samples of events of the size corresponding to about 6 years of data gathering .",
    "the sampling has been performed by a product of two probabilities : @xmath11 ( oscillation signal ) and 0.01 ( normalisation to the right amount of events ) .",
    "this is a way to approximately incorporate the statistical error of the overall normalisation .",
    "+ each sample represents a _",
    "typical _ set of events as they are expected to be seen in sk .",
    "compare the experimentally measured muon distribution with the reference samples in order to extract the oscillation parameters .",
    "two strategies are considered : * @xmath12 estimator is used ( the considered bins are expected to contain at least 10 or 20 events ) : @xmath13 the index @xmath14 runs through all bins containing data sets for muon exclusive and muon+pion(s ) events .",
    "the symbol @xmath15 stands for the number of measured events in each bin whereas @xmath16 is the expected number of events predicted by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the normalisation constant @xmath17 reflects the fact that our fit model has two unknown parameters : @xmath10 and @xmath6 .",
    "we go through templates produced in step ( 2 ) and look for a minimum of the @xmath18 . *",
    "poisson statistical estimator @xcite is used ( the considered bins are expected to contain at least 3 events ) : @xmath19.\\ ] ]",
    "the space of oscillation parameters is mapped into a two dimensional lattice on the ( @xmath6 , @xmath10 ) plane .",
    "the lattice intervals were @xmath20}$ ] in @xmath6 and @xmath21 in @xmath10 .",
    "physical expectation constraints have been used on the parameter ranges ( e.g. @xmath22 , @xmath23\\times 10^{-4}\\mathrm{[ev^2]}$ ] ) .",
    "tests have been performed for few values of `` true '' ( @xmath6 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "for each one of them 200 mc data samples have been created .",
    "the histograms have been made for several histogram bin sizes and statistical cuts .",
    "the range of the bins in muon energy has been fixed to 200 - 1200 @xmath24}$ ] . for the @xmath18 statistics 100 , 80 , 75 and 50 @xmath24}$ ] bins have been used .",
    "the binning in @xmath25 has been varied between 1/4 and 1/20 .",
    "the smallest bins were at the verge of super - k resolution@xcite .",
    "alternative binning in @xmath26 has been also performed .",
    "there were nine bins between 0 and 90 degrees and one bin for the backward scattered muons .",
    "this binning has been used to extract information in the near 1 [ kt ] detector in the super- kamiokande experiment@xcite .",
    "two statistical cuts were imposed on the bins : at least 10 and at least 20 events .",
    "bins with lower expected statistics had been discarded .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath18 statistics occurred to give unsatisfying results .",
    "too few samples were identified with the right oscillation parameters .",
    "the poisson method has given better results.the tested bins were 100 , 80 , 75 , 50 @xmath24}$ ] and 1/5 , 1/10 , 1/15 , 1/20 @xmath27}$ ] .",
    "the best result has been found for 50 @xmath24}$ ] x 1/5 @xmath27}$ ] binning .",
    "the figure [ fig : result ] shows the distribution of results on the reference lattice for ( @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath29 ) and ( @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 ) .",
    "each bin on the plot gives the number of data samples identified with one point of the lattice .",
    "[ fig : result ]    @xmath32{01.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=8cm]{02.eps }    \\end{array } $ ]",
    "the method gives quite good concentration of the results around the expected value .",
    "judging from the plots , without inclusion of the systematic errors , results have 1 @xmath33 areas of about @xmath34}$ ] in @xmath6 and @xmath35 in @xmath10 .",
    "the error in @xmath6 is close to the expected uncertainties of t2k@xcite , but the uncertainty of @xmath10 is larger .",
    "these uncertainties depend strongly on the area , in which the true values of oscillation parameters are located . for small values of both @xmath10 and @xmath6",
    "the concentration of the results around true value is rather poor .",
    "it seems , that this method is better at extracting the squared mass difference then the mixing angle .",
    "this happens probably due to the error of overall normalisation .",
    "the position of the oscillation probability maximum depends on @xmath36 , whereas its depth depends on the @xmath37 .",
    "thus the total number of recorded events should depend more on the @xmath37 , then @xmath36 .",
    "more effort must be made to find optimal method of binning .",
    "perhaps using non regular bin shapes will improve the method s performance .",
    "in general a compromise must be found : to have many bins in the region sensitive to oscillation signal but also to keep high statistics .",
    "we are aware that the systematic errors will add more uncertainty but its evaluation is a separate complicated problem .",
    "the authors were supported by the grant 35/n - t2k/2007/0 ( the project number dwm/57/t2k/2007 ) .",
