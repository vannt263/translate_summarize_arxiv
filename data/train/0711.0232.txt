    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , the higgs sector has two doublets , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which couple to fermions with weak isospin @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively @xcite .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , there remain five physical higgs bosons : a pair of singly charged higgs bosons @xmath13 , two neutral cp - even scalars @xmath8 ( heavier ) and @xmath14 ( lighter ) , and a neutral cp - odd pseudoscalar @xmath7 . the higgs potential is constrained by supersymmetry such that all tree - level higgs boson masses and couplings are determined by just two independent parameters , commonly chosen to be the mass of the cp - odd pseudoscalar ( @xmath15 ) and the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgs fields ( @xmath16 ) .    at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , gluon fusion ( @xmath17 , or @xmath7 )",
    "is the major source of neutral higgs bosons in the mssm for @xmath18 less than about 5 .",
    "if @xmath18 is larger than 7 , neutral higgs bosons are dominantly produced from bottom quark fusion @xmath19 @xcite . since the yukawa couplings of @xmath20 are enhanced by @xmath21 , the production rate of neutral higgs bosons , especially the @xmath7 or the @xmath8 ,",
    "is enhanced at large @xmath18 .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the search for a higgs boson produced along with a single bottom quark with large transverse momentum ( @xmath22 ) , where the leading order subprocess is @xmath23 @xcite , could be more promising than the production of a higgs boson associated with two high @xmath22 bottom quarks @xcite where the leading order subprocess is @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this has already been demonstrated to be the case for the @xmath25 decay mode of the higgs bosons @xcite . for a large value of @xmath18 ,",
    "the @xmath26 decay mode @xcite is also a promising discovery channel for the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 in the mssm because the branching fraction for higgs decay into tau leptons is greater by a factor of @xmath27 .",
    "the downside is that unlike muons , tau leptons can only be observed indirectly via their hadronic or leptonic decay products .    in this article , we present the prospects of discovering the mssm neutral higgs bosons produced with a bottom quark via higgs decay into tau pairs .",
    "we calculate the higgs signal and the dominant standard model ( sm ) backgrounds with realistic cuts and efficiencies and evaluate the @xmath28 discovery contour in the @xmath29 plane for the lhc and for the tevatron .",
    "we calculate the cross section at the lhc for @xmath30 and at the tevatron for @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) via @xmath33 with the parton distribution functions of cteq6l1 @xcite .",
    "the factorization scale is chosen to be @xmath34 @xcite . in this article ,",
    "unless explicitly specified , @xmath35 represents a bottom quark ( @xmath35 ) or a bottom anti - quark ( @xmath36 ) . the bottom quark mass in the @xmath20 yukawa coupling is chosen to be the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) running mass at the renormalization scale @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xcite , and it is calculated with @xmath39 gev and nlo evolution of the strong coupling @xcite .",
    "we have also taken the renormalization scale for the production processes to be @xmath34 , which effectively reproduces the effects of next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "therefore , we take the @xmath40 factor to be one for the higgs signal .",
    "the cross section for @xmath41 can be thought of as the higgs production cross section @xmath42 multiplied by the branching fraction of the higgs decay into tau pairs @xmath43 .",
    "when the @xmath44 mode dominates higgs decays , the branching fraction of @xmath45 is about @xmath46 where @xmath47 , the running mass at the scale @xmath48 , is used in the decay rates .",
    "this results in a branching fraction for @xmath49 of @xmath50 for @xmath51 gev .",
    "thus for @xmath52 and @xmath53 gev , the cross section of @xmath54 or that of @xmath55 is enhanced by approximately @xmath56 and the branching fraction of higgs decay to tau pair is close to @xmath57 .",
    "tau leptons can decay either purely leptonically , @xmath58 , with a branching ratio of around @xmath59 for each mode @xmath60 , or they can decay into low - multiplicity hadronic states and a @xmath61 with a branching ratio @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a @xmath63 pair , the most likely scenario is one decaying leptonically and the other hadronically , which has a combined branching ratio of @xmath64 . also , the presence of an isolated lepton in the final state is useful in triggering the event and reducing backgrounds .",
    "hence , we use this `` lepton + @xmath65-jet '' signature in our study .",
    "we model hadronic tau decays as the sum of two - body decays into @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 with branching ratios given in the literature @xcite .",
    "the tau is assumed to be energetic enough that all its decay products emerge in approximately the same direction as the tau itself .",
    "this manifests itself in the so - called `` collinear approximation '' which we use for both leptonic and hadronic decays .",
    "the approximation is confirmed to be accurate by comparison with an exact matrix element simulation for tau decay .    in figure 1 , we present the transverse momentum distribution ( @xmath69 ) for the bottom quark ( @xmath35 ) , or the lepton ( @xmath70 ) or the tau hadron ( @xmath71 ) from tau decays , for the higgs signal @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , we show the @xmath22 distribution for @xmath35 , @xmath70 , or @xmath71 from the sm background @xmath73 ( drell - yan ) . we have required @xmath74 gev and @xmath75 .",
    "the purpose of this figure is to show these cross sections before any other cuts have been applied .",
    "the atlas collaboration has studied identification efficiencies of @xmath65-jets in detail @xcite .",
    "based on this we use an overall efficiency of @xmath76 over 1- and 3-prong decays with a corresponding cut , @xmath77 gev for the hadron @xmath78 .",
    "this also corresponds to a mistag efficiency of @xmath79 for non-@xmath65 ( i.e. qcd ) jets .",
    "rejection of jets from @xmath35 quarks is higher , with only 1 in 700 being mistagged as @xmath65s .",
    "the transverse momentum cut on the lepton from tau decay is weaker , with @xmath80 gev .",
    "both the hadron and lepton are required to be in the central rapidity region @xmath81 .",
    "the acceptance cuts as well as tagging and mistagging efficiencies for the fermilab tevatron will be discussed in section vii .",
    "the higgs mass can be reconstructed indirectly , using the collinear approximation for @xmath65 decay products and the missing transverse momentum 2-vector , @xmath82 .",
    "taking @xmath83 to be the energy fractions carried away from the decays by the lepton and hadron respectively , we have : @xmath84 this yields two equations for @xmath85 and @xmath86 which can be solved to reconstruct the two original @xmath65 4-momenta @xmath87 @xmath88 . thus @xmath89 .",
    "physically we must have @xmath90 , and this provides a further cut to reduce the background .",
    "measurement errors in lepton and @xmath65-jet momenta as well as missing transverse momentum give rise to a spread in the reconstructed mass about the true value .",
    "based on the atlas and the cdf specifications we model these effects by gaussian smearing of momenta : @xmath91 for jets ( with individual terms added in quadrature ) and @xmath92 for charged leptons .",
    "we find that in more than @xmath93 of the cases , the reconstructed mass lies within @xmath94 of the actual mass .",
    "therefore we apply a mass cut , requiring the reconstructed mass to lie in the mass window @xmath95 , where @xmath96 for an integrated luminosity ( @xmath97 ) of 30 fb@xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 300 fb@xmath98 .",
    "this cut is actually rather conservative because for larger higgs masses , more than @xmath101 of the reconstructed masses are within @xmath102 of @xmath48 .",
    "we note that improvements in the discovery potential will be possible by narrowing @xmath103 if the @xmath65 pair mass resolution can be improved .",
    "figure 2 shows the invariant mass distribution of the tau pair for the higgs signal @xmath104 via @xmath105 , and for the tau pair from the sm drell - yan background @xmath73 .",
    "we have calculated the higgs signal in two ways : ( a ) with the narrow width approximation @xmath106 and ( b ) the full calculation @xmath107 with a breit - wigner resonance via @xmath108 . in this figure",
    "we have applied all acceptance cuts discussed in the next two sections except the requirement on invariant mass .",
    "we note that with energy - momentum smearing , the cross section in the narrow width approximation agrees very well with that evaluated for a breit - wigner resonance .",
    "from the above discussion , the signal we are looking for is @xmath35-jet ( @xmath35 ) + lepton ( @xmath70 ) + @xmath65-jet ( @xmath109 ) + @xmath110 + @xmath111 , where @xmath112 missing transverse energy @xmath113 missing transverse momentum .",
    "the dominant physics backgrounds to this final state come from :    * drell - yan processes : @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "approximately @xmath116 of the dy contribution arises from the subprocess @xmath73 .",
    "* top production ( @xmath117 ) : this can contribute in several ways depending on how the @xmath118s decay . in order of highest to lowest importance , the relevant channels are the following .",

    "( d ) @xmath126 : we can have both @xmath118s decay leptonically .",

    "we find that this background is effectively cut to less than @xmath57 of the dominant background at all times by an isolation cut on the lepton @xmath142 , the large rejection factor for non-@xmath65 jets , and the requirement @xmath143 gev .    for the lower integrated luminosity ( @xmath97 ) of 30 fb@xmath98",
