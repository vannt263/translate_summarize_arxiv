    "g1.9 + 0.3 has been known as a potentially young shell type galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) of very small angular size @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in this snr was revived by @xcite who analyzed the expansion rate of the object and deduced an age @xmath6 of about 100  yr , which makes it the youngest known snr in the galaxy . although the expansion rate was derived by a comparison of radio observations in 1985 and _ chandra _ observations in 2007 , this rate has been confirmed very soon thereafter by independent radio observations @xcite .    according to @xcite , the line - free x - ray emission has a pure synchrotron origin which clearly indicates that effective particle acceleration takes place , at least for electrons .",
    "there are also arguments , like the bilateral symmetry of the x - ray synchrotron emission suggesting a roughly uniform ambient magnetic field , that favor a type ia origin for g1.9 + 0.3 .",
    "finally , the distance estimate @xmath7  kpc is based on an analysis of the absorption toward g1.9 + 0.3 .    during the survey of the inner galaxy by h.e.s.s . in very high energy @xmath8-rays ,",
    "no emission was reported from the direction to g1.9 + 0.3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can derive an upper limit at the level of 2% of the crab flux above 200 gev .",
    "for the purpose of a more general study of such an unusual object regarding its nonthermal properties , it is of interest to describe it by a kinetic theory of cosmic ray ( cr ) acceleration in snrs , coupled with the gas dynamics of the thermal plasma , as given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this model assumes spherical symmetry , although the assumption is later relaxed .",
    "similar models on almost the same physical basis have recently been developed by two other groups @xcite , whose calculations very well confirm these earlier results .",
    "the kinetic description allows a corresponding analysis of the nonthermal evolution of an snr at a very early phase .",
    "this assumes that the plasma physics underlying especially the temporal dependence of the magnetic field amplification process can be extrapolated to such an early evolutionary phase , where the dynamical behavior of the ejecta plays an essential role .",
    "such a study is reported here .",
    "it is combined with a discussion about the influence of the assumption of a smaller distance on the tev @xmath8-ray flux .",
    "following @xcite it is assumed that g1.9 + 0.3 is a type ia supernova ( type ia sn ) which expands into a uniform interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "specifically , the object is assumed to eject a chandrasekhar mass @xmath9 with a total hydrodynamic explosion energy @xmath10  erg . during an initial period",
    ", the ejecta material has a broad distribution in velocity @xmath11 .",
    "the fastest part of these ejecta is described by a power law @xmath12 with @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ism mass density @xmath14 , which is usually characterized by the hydrogen number density @xmath15 , is an important parameter which strongly influences the expected snr dynamics and nonthermal emission ; here @xmath16 denotes the proton mass .",
    "following @xcite also a distance @xmath0  kpc is adopted for the main part of the paper .",
    "the observed shock size @xmath17  pc and shock speed @xmath18  km  s@xmath3 are then used to determine the snr age @xmath6 and the ism number density @xmath15 for the given source distance @xmath5 .    as reviewed earlier @xcite and elaborated most recently in detail in @xcite ,",
    "the key parameters of the theoretical model ( proton injection flux density , given by a constant injection parameter @xmath19 times the thermal particle flux density into the shock , electron - proton ratio below the synchrotron cooling range , later denoted as @xmath20 , and magnetic field amplification ) can be estimated in a semi - empirical way from a fit of the theoretical solution to the observed synchrotron emission spectrum if the characteristics of the initial explosion and the relevant astronomical parameters are known .",
    "for this purpose , the nonlinear aspects of the kinetic description are required .    of the above - mentioned processes , the magnetic field amplification @xcite is the least well understood .",
    "it is connected with the strong nonlinear excitation of magnetic field fluctuations in the shock precursor by the accelerating energetic particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is assumed here that these fluctuations lead to bohm diffusion of the energetic particles in this amplified field .",
    "such a bootstrap mechanism can be approximately justified by the results of recent particle simulations @xcite .",
    "in addition , the amplification process is strongly dissipative , as shown by hydromagnetic and kinetic simulations @xcite .",
    "therefore , it must be accompanied by strong gas heating within the precursor region @xmath21 due to wave dissipation , adopted in the present model in the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 is the gas thermal energy density , @xmath25 denotes the energetic particle pressure , and where , in a second bootstrap mechanism , @xmath26 is the alfvn velocity in the amplified field @xmath27 ( see below ) .",
    "the value @xmath28 corresponds to the assumption that the alfvn wave field excited within the precursor reaches amplitudes which are very much smaller than the maximal amplitudes which could be reached if the whole work @xmath29 done by crs went into wave excitation .",
    "in such a case , this work goes almost completely into gas heating due to the wave damping .",
    "the gas thermal pressure just ahead of subshock is in this case considerably larger than the pressure of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "therefore , the subshock can be treated approximately as a pure gas shock .",
    "this approximation will later be re - examined through the approximate inclusion of the amplified field and its associated turbulent gas motions in the subshock dynamics .",
    "the magnitude of field amplification in all young snrs is such that a non - negligible fraction of the shock energy @xmath30 is converted into magnetic field energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , a time dependent , amplified upstream magnetic field strength @xmath31^{\\delta } \\label{b0}\\ ] ] is used here , where the theory parameter @xmath32 is the rms field strength at the present epoch @xmath6 and is estimated by a comparison of the theoretically calculated synchrotron spectrum with the observed one ( see below ) .",
    "such a form of the time dependence of the amplified magnetic field with @xmath33 is consistent with the interior field strengths estimated from observational results for a number of young snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "( since @xcite even estimated a dependence @xmath34 for the field amplification due to the nonresonant streaming instability alone , also the case of @xmath35 will be examined here .",
    "the radial dependence of the rms .",
    "magnetic field strength @xmath36 in the shock precursor is then modeled by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the far upstream ( interstellar ) density . in the overall conservation relations for momentum and energy of the system ,",
    "the magnetic field strength in the upstream ism is @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 is the field amplification factor by the accelerating energetic particles alone .",
    "an analysis performed for a number of young snrs shows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the field strength @xmath41 , required to fit the observed synchrotron spectrum , is well within the range expected from theoretical estimates ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed x - ray morphology of snr g1.9 + 0.3 agrees with the theoretical expectations regarding the morphology of ion injection and the corresponding morphology of magnetic field amplification for a type ia sn @xcite .",
    "it is therefore consistent with a correction for the spherically symmetric solution by a renormalization factor @xmath42 of the energy density of nuclear particles , like in the case of sn  1006 @xcite . in this case",
    ", the electron - proton ratio @xmath20 , calculated under the assumption of spherical symmetry , should be increased by a factor @xmath43 .",
    "the calculated evolution of the gas dynamical variables of g1.9 + 0.3 is shown in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "the observed shock radius @xmath44 and shock speed @xmath45 are fitted at the age @xmath46 yr and for an ism hydrogen number density @xmath47 @xmath48 ( figure  [ f1]a ) . since the remnant is in the free expansion phase , it is approximately consistent with an analytical self - similar solution @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "note that an explosion model with an exponential ejecta velocity profile gives slightly larger values of the age , @xmath50 yr , and of the ism density , corresponding to a hydrogen number density of about @xmath51 @xmath48 , for the same assumed distance of @xmath0  kpc @xcite .",
    "the calculated radius @xmath52 of the contact discontinuity ( cd ) and the cd speed @xmath53 are also shown in figure [ f1](a ) .",
    "one can see that the ratio @xmath54 is rather small . at the current epoch @xmath55 .    to obtain a good fit for the observed synchrotron spectrum ( see below ) first of all a proton injection rate @xmath56 is required .",
    "it leads to a nonlinear modification of the shock which , at the current age of @xmath57  yr , has a total compression ratio @xmath58 and a subshock compression ratio @xmath59 ( figure [ f1](b ) ) .",
    "in addition , an electron - proton ratio @xmath60 and an upstream amplified magnetic field strength at the current epoch @xmath61",
    "@xmath62 g are required .",
    "this implies a downstream magnetic field strength of @xmath63  @xmath62 g .",
    "all the above quantities are almost the same for the two different time dependences of the magnetic field @xmath64 within the evolutionary period @xmath65  yr .",
    "the only difference between these cases is a slightly more rapid increase of the shock modification ( characterized by the shock compression ratio @xmath66 ) in the case @xmath67 compared with the case @xmath68 due to the increase of the alfvnic mach number @xmath69 .    to explain these results",
    "it is noted that , as in other , similar cases of strong , modified shocks , the existing measurements permit an estimate of the three parameters of the theoretical model .",
    "this takes into account the following influence of the parameters on the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "( 1 ) since the high - energy electrons undergo strong synchrotron losses and , since during the acceleration process they dominate the nonthermal electron pressure @xmath70 , the flux of x - ray synchrotron emission which they produce @xmath71 is approximately proportional to the total energy flux of nonthermal electrons @xmath72 , and is only weakly sensitive to the magnetic field strength @xmath41 .",
    "the spectrum of high - energy protons @xmath73 , which give the main contribution to the total cr pressure @xmath74 , is only weakly sensitive to the injection parameter @xmath75 in the case of a modified shock .",
    "therefore , the fit of the _ observed x - ray flux _ mainly determines the value @xmath20 of the electron : proton ratio .",
    "the spectrum of accelerated electrons is calculated in absolute numbers .",
    "it is expressed in terms of @xmath20 , due to the presumably dominant dynamical role of protons .",
    "( 2 ) values @xmath76 of the radio spectral index @xmath77 , as observed in young snrs , require a modified shock with @xmath78 ( this also implies a curved electron spectrum that hardens toward high frequencies ) .",
    "the value of @xmath79 is mainly determined by the subshock compression ratio @xmath80 , which in turn is determined mainly by the proton injection rate @xmath75 .",
    "therefore the fit of the _ measured spectral shape _ of the radio synchrotron emission gives mainly the required value of the injection parameter @xmath75 .",
    "( 3 ) finally , since the radio emission flux value @xmath81 is strongly dependent upon the magnetic field strength , its value @xmath82 is derived from the fit to the _ observed amplitude _ of the radio spectrum .",
    "thus , three measured characteristics of the synchrotron spectrum  x - ray flux , shape , and amplitude of the radio emission  make it possible to obtain an estimate of the three relevant `` theory parameters ''",
    "@xmath82 , @xmath20 and @xmath75 even though this is not a simple three - step procedure but an iterative procedure , minimizing the combined @xmath83-value ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "note that the magnetic field value @xmath82 can also be estimated by another , independent method , namely from a fit of the _ observed spatial fine structure _ of the x - ray emission .",
    "in all the cases where such measurements exist , both methods give consistent values of @xmath82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the fine structure of the x - ray emission is not determined yet for g1.9 + 0.3 .",
    "therefore , this consistency check can not be made at present .",
    "the uncertainties of the estimated values of @xmath75 , @xmath82 , and @xmath20 depend upon the quality of the measurements of the synchrotron spectrum and can be rather small , as it was recently demonstrated for the case of sn  1006 @xcite . in the case under consideration",
    "it is about 20% for @xmath82 and @xmath20 and 30% for @xmath75 .",
    "it should also be noted that due to the very low age of the snr and the low ism density the expected thermal x - ray emission is far below the observed x - ray flux , which is therefore completely dominated by the nonthermal component .",
    "the required proton injection rate @xmath56 is considerably higher than the critical value @xmath84 , which separates a nonlinearly modified shock with @xmath85 from an unmodified state , resulting from very low injection rates @xmath86 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.38 ) .",
    "the relatively weak shock modification is the result of the very large magnetic field @xmath41 , that leads to strong gas heating within the precursor region @xmath21 .    in order to check the sensitivity of the results to the adopted value of the parameter @xmath87 , calculations with",
    "@xmath88 were performed .",
    "it turned out that even for @xmath89 the shock properties are not very far from the case @xmath23 : the required far upstream magnetic field value is @xmath90  @xmath62 g , and the shock compression ratios are @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it is noted here that the results of @xcite suggest a stronger sensitivity of the shock properties to the value of @xmath87 .",
    "the reason is that in the considerations of these authors the parameter @xmath87 determines not only the gas heating through the term @xmath93 , but also the upstream magnetic field generation through a complementary term @xmath94 .",
    "such an approach implies that magnetic field amplification takes place only due to resonant excitation of alfvn waves and , in addition , according to such a quasi - linear expression .",
    "in contrast , the present model allows that the magnetic field is also amplified nonresonantly @xcite .",
    "secondly , the determination of the amplified field @xmath32 in the present semi - empirical model uses the synchrotron observations of the source .",
    "for both these reasons , the magnetic field amplification and the gas heating are not connected by a simple relation .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , an alfvnic connection @xmath95 between the magnetic field fluctuation vector @xmath96 and the fluctuation vector @xmath97 of the mass velocity is assumed .",
    "this implies an approximately incompressible plasma turbulence with a locally homogeneous mass density @xmath98 , where the total ( mean square magnetic field plus plasma turbulent ) pressure is given by @xmath99 , and the total ( mean square magnetic field plus plasma turbulent ) energy flux density equals @xmath100 ; here @xmath101 denotes the shock - normal mean mass velocity in the shock frame .",
    "these normal components of the momentum and energy flux densities , immediately upstream and downstream of the subshock were included in the rankine ",
    "hugoniot conditions for the subshock .",
    "the latter is approximated as a locally plane , normal shock wave .",
    "( in the precursor region , @xmath102 is the mean square strength of the amplified magnetic field @xmath27 , introduced in the previous section and assumed here to be isotropically distributed with gaussian statistics ; the field strength downstream of the subshock is taken to be @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the field strength upstream of the subshock . )",
    "note that the above expression for the total turbulent energy flux density @xmath105 in the downstream region differs somewhat from the expression used by @xcite .",
    "since the consideration of these authors is based on the transmission and reflection of small - amplitude alfvn waves at purely parallel subshock , it is believed here that this linear treatment is not applicable to the actual case of a strongly perturbed and amplified magnetic field ( see also the arguments of @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the approximations introduced above do not exactly describe the true physical situation thatalso contains the nonresonantly unstable modes of the bell instability @xcite , because these transverse modes will in their nonlinear evolution also develop compressible elements @xcite . in addition",
    ", also the acoustic modes @xcite will contribute .",
    "their influence on the strength of the subshock remains to be evaluated .",
    "however it is believed that the present description gives a roughly correct estimate of the subshock effects of at least the incompressible part of the fluctuation fields produced by the accelerating particles .    in the adopted approximation @xmath106 , @xmath107 for @xmath108 , very close to the previous case , where the turbulent momentum and energy fluxes were ignored in the subshock conservation relations",
    "the effect is somewhat larger for the smallest value of the parameter @xmath89 : it leads to a decrease of @xmath109 from @xmath91 to @xmath110 and to a decrease of the magnetic field strength from @xmath90  @xmath62 g to @xmath111  @xmath62 g , which is not a large effect either .",
    "it should also be noted that the assumption of considerable gas heating due to wave dissipation , corresponding to @xmath112 , is consistent with the numerical modeling of the nonresonant wave excitation @xcite .",
    "such dissipation should operate in a similar way for the resonant alfvn mode instability .",
    "it is therefore concluded that insignificant gas heating , which occurs for @xmath113 within the present formalism , is an unrealistic assumption .      with the renormalization @xmath114 , the nuclear crs inside g1.9 + 0.3 snr contain ( figure [ f1](c ) ) @xmath115 the volume - integrated ( or overall ) cr spectrum @xmath116 has , for the case of protons",
    ", almost a pure power - law form @xmath117 over a wide momentum range from @xmath118 up to the cutoff momentum @xmath119 ( figure [ f2 ] ) .",
    "this value @xmath120 is limited mainly by the finite size and speed of the shock , its deceleration and the adiabatic cooling effect in the downstream region ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "as pointed out above , particle diffusion is approximated by bohm diffusion in the amplified magnetic field @xmath27 , cf .",
    "equation ( 1 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the calculated value of @xmath121 is therefore an upper limit , because it is assumed that up to the cutoff all particles `` see '' the amplified field everywhere .",
    "consequently , g1.9 + 0.3 represents the youngest snr where the accelerated proton spectrum extends up the so - called knee energy .",
    "such a maximum proton energy appears indeed required to describe the overall cr spectrum for energies up to @xmath122  ev @xcite .",
    "the shape of the overall electron spectrum @xmath123 deviates from that of the proton spectrum @xmath73 at high momenta @xmath124 on account of the synchrotron losses during the electron residence time in the downstream region ( figure [ f2 ] ) . within the momentum range @xmath125 ,",
    "the electron spectrum is considerably steeper , @xmath126 , due to synchrotron losses taking place in the downstream region after the acceleration at the shock front .",
    "the maximum electron momentum @xmath127 corresponds closely to the result obtained by equating the synchrotron loss time and the acceleration time .",
    "figure [ f3 ] illustrates the consistency of the synchrotron spectrum , calculated for the above - mentioned best set of parameters with the observed spatially integrated spectra .    as mentioned above , values @xmath128 of the radio spectral index @xmath129 , as observed in young snrs , require a curved electron spectrum that hardens toward higher energies , as predicted by nonlinear shock acceleration theory . to have @xmath130 in the radio range , as observed for g1.9 + 0.3 @xcite , requires efficient cr acceleration with a proton injection rate @xmath56 which leads to the required shock modification , and also leads to the high magnetic field value above .",
    "as it is clear from figure [ f3 ] , a good fit of the observed x - ray energy flux can only be achieved due to the softening of the synchrotron spectrum for @xmath131  hz , which is due to the strong synchrotron losses of electrons with momenta @xmath132 . using the known dependence @xmath133 , at @xmath134 one",
    "can immediately estimate the required value of the interior magnetic field value @xmath135  @xmath62 g , consistent with the above determination from the radio spectrum .",
    "the calculated hard power - law x - ray spectrum continues almost up to 50  kev , making this source in principle attractive to be observed with _",
    "suzaku _ and _ integral _ and the future astro - h x - ray instrument .",
    "a very important question for every young snr is whether the existing data indeed unavoidably require efficient proton acceleration accompanied by strong magnetic field amplification . in order to explore the alternative possibility , figure [ f3 ]",
    "presents in the dotted curve a synchrotron spectrum which corresponds to a hypothetical leptonic scenario with a proton injection rate so small ( @xmath136 ) that the accelerated nuclear crs do not produce any significant shock modification and therefore also no magnetic field amplification .",
    "this corresponds to the test particle limit , when the distribution function of shock accelerated electrons has the form @xmath137 where the amplitude @xmath138 and the value of the cutoff momentum @xmath121 are determined by the fit to the observed synchrotron spectrum for a given interior magnetic field value @xmath82 .",
    "since magnetic field amplification is not expected in this case , the downstream magnetic field can not be larger than the mhd - compressed ism field @xmath139  @xmath62 g .",
    "the maximal possible downstream field @xmath140",
    "@xmath62 g is adopted which corresponds to the minimal number of accelerating electrons , and therefore the @xmath8-ray emission produced by these electrons is also minimal .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum for the leptonic test particle scenario in figure [ f3 ] corresponds to the maximal electron energy @xmath141  tev , determined by the _",
    "chandra _ observation .",
    "there are two differences in the synchrotron spectra , corresponding to these two scenarios .",
    "the high - injection scenario leads to a soft radio spectrum @xmath142 with power law index @xmath130 , whereas in the test particle case @xmath143 .",
    "on the other hand , the two spectra behave essentially differently at x - ray frequencies @xmath144 .",
    "this demonstrates that only in the high - injection case with its high , amplified magnetic field value @xmath145  @xmath62 g the spectrum @xmath146 has a smooth cutoff , consistent with the observations ( see figure [ f3 ] ) . in the test particle case the spectrum",

    ", the galactic interstellar optical and infrared radiation fields in the inner galaxy are considerably higher than previously thought , for this region the calculation of the ic flux was performed on the basis of those estimates .",
    "the higher radiation field leads to an increase of the ic gamma - ray flux at energies @xmath153  tev by an order of magnitude compared with a standard interstellar radiation field in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "was already explored by h.e.s.s . for times of more than 100  hr without detection of g1.9",
    "+ 0.3 , this purely leptonic test particle scenario should be rejected as in all similar cases of type ia sne @xcite .",
    "it is , however , to be noted that the expected @xmath8-ray flux is very sensitive to the assumed source distance @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , snr g1.9 + 0.3 could be a potential @xmath8-ray source if the actual distance was lower than 8.5  kpc .",
    "qualitatively , the dependence of the expected @xmath8-ray flux on distance can be understood if one takes into account that the @xmath150-decay @xmath8-ray energy flux @xmath154 is proportional to the mass of gas , @xmath155 , swept up by the sn shock , and to the energy density @xmath156 of the crs producing @xmath8-rays of given energy . since for high acceleration efficiency",

    "taking also into account that for a fixed angular expansion rate of the object @xmath162 , one obtains @xmath163 according to this relation a mere 30% reduction of the source distance leads to an increase of the expected @xmath8-ray flux by a factor of more than 10 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ f4 ] , where also @xmath8-ray spectra are presented that were calculated for the distance value @xmath164  kpc . in this case",
    "the shock velocity and size could be fitted at the same age @xmath46 yr and for an ism hydrogen number density @xmath165 @xmath48 .",
    "a similar fit for the radio and x - ray data as in figure [ f4 ] could be achieved with an electron - proton ratio @xmath166 and a downstream magnetic field strength @xmath167  @xmath62 g .",
    "it is clear that g1.9 + 0.3 could be visible in tev @xmath8-rays by future instruments like the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) , if the actual distance was not larger than @xmath164  kpc .    the theoretical , spatially integrated radio synchrotron flux slowly increases with time , as can be seen in figure [ f5 ] , essentially due to the rapidly increasing total number of accelerated electrons in the increasing snr volume @xmath168 .",
    "the x - ray synchrotron flux is expected to be nearly constant in time ( figure [ f5 ] ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the strong synchrotron cooling of the highest energy electrons which produce the x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "the tev @xmath8-ray flux is expected to increase with time as well ( figure [ f5 ] ) , mainly due to the increase of overall number of crs with energy above 10  tev .",
    "if the ambient interstellar magnetic field would be completely disordered on spatial scales smaller than the shock size , then efficient cr injection / acceleration would be expected across the whole shock surface .",
    "in such a case @xmath169 and the expected gamma - ray flux would be higher by a factor of @xmath170 , whereas all the emission produced by cr electrons would remain the same since the normalization of the electron spectrum was done based on the observations .",
    "however , it is believed that the actual situation is opposite : the bilateral symmetry of the x - ray synchrotron emission suggests a roughly uniform ambient magnetic field on a parsec scale and therefore @xmath171 like in sn  1006 .",
    "the existing data for g1.9 + 0.3 , when analyzed within the framework of the nonlinear kinetic theory of cr production in snrs described above , are consistent with a type ia explosion in a rarefied medium at a distance of @xmath0  kpc , whose nuclear cr spectrum reaches the energy of the `` knee '' in the observed galactic cr spectrum at the present epoch .",
    "this conclusion also concerns the derived strong magnetic field amplification .",
    "a test particle , purely leptonic gamma - ray scenario , is inconsistent with existing tev gamma - ray observations with the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope array .",

    "since the expected @xmath8-ray flux is very sensitive to the distance @xmath5 , @xmath172 , a detection of the @xmath8-ray flux from g1.9 + 0.3 , as improbable as it may be , would yield the distance .",
    "however , in the case when g1.9 + 0.3 is located near the galactic center ( @xmath0  kpc ) , the expected tev @xmath8-ray energy flux is so low , @xmath173  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 , that it is not detectable with present instruments .",
    "it is clear that for a distance that was not larger than @xmath164  kpc g1.9 + 0.3 could be visible with future instruments like cta which can be assumed to have a sensitivity of @xmath174  mcrab at a few 100 gev @xcite .",
