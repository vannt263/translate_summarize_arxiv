    "combining observational data available from the successful launch of chandra and xmm / newton x - ray space missions with the significant progress in theoretical studies of the physics of dense matter , these developments offer the hope for distinguishing various competing neutron star thermal evolution models . through this way we would have an opportunity to determine various important properties of dense matter , such as the composition , superfluidity and the equation of state .",
    "these progresses should help us obtain deeper insight into the properties of dense matter .",
    "quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) predicted the existence of quark matter at high density .",
    "moreover phenomenological and microscopic studies also confirmed that quark matter at a sufficiently high density , as in compact stars , undergoes a phase transition into a color superconductivity state , which are typical cases of the 2-flavor color superconductivity ( 2sc ) and color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phases .",
    "theoretical approaches concur that the superconductivity order parameter , which determines the gap in the quark spectrum , lies between 1 and @xmath0 for baryon densities existing in the interiors of compact stars .",
    "it is generally believed that appearance of quark matter would be implied in structure and evolution of compact stars .",
    "mass - radius relation and changes in structure have been deeply investigated in an amount of literatures@xcite .",
    "the evolutionary properties associated with spin of the star have been extensively discussed in past work@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , someones had ever expected compact star cooling as a probe to distinguish quark matter from hadronic matter@xcite .",
    "the researches showed that the cooler stars contain perhaps quark matter .",
    "however , the problem is unsolvable .",
    "as known , continuous deconfinement processes occur during the rotation evolution of the star if quark core exists@xcite .",
    "the corresponding deconfinement heating(dh ) extremely influences the evolution temperature of the star .",
    "no matter whether a strange star which sustain a tiny nuclear crust is in normal phase or in color superconducing phase , dh should delay the cooling of the star .",
    "consequently , the strange star become warmer so that it would nt cooler@xcite .",
    "it is well know that a compact star spins down due to magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "so the dh processes are closely related with the magnetic field .",
    "when we take constant field into account for the calculations of heating rate , the star would maintain too high temperature at old age evolutionary time , during which we have not found such hot pulsar yet(see figures in @xcite ) except a few of millisecond pulsars .",
    "however , the observations support the fact that the field could decay such as ohmic decay and the decay time scale is about @xmath1 years .",
    "obviously , the dh will decrease due to field decay at old ages . in this paper",
    ", we will assess how the thermal evolution of a strange star would be affected .",
    "the most efficient cooling process in unpaired quark matter is the quark direct urac(qdu ) process @xmath2 and @xmath3 , given by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath6,@xmath7 is the baryon density and @xmath8 is the nuclear saturation density,@xmath9 is the electron fraction , and @xmath10 is the temperature in units of @xmath11k . when the qdu process being switched off due to a small electron fraction ( @xmath12 . )",
    ", the dominating contribution to the emissivities is the quark modified urca(qmu ) @xmath13 and quark bremsstrahlung(qb ) @xmath14 processes , estimated as@xcite @xmath15 @xmath16    because of the pairing in color superconducting phase , the emissivity of qdu process is suppressed by a factor of @xmath17 and the emissivities of qmu and qb processes are suppressed by a factor @xmath18 for @xmath19@xcite .    in order to compute the cooling curves of the stars , we need to give the specific heat of the electrons and quarks@xcite : @xmath20 @xmath21    but in color superconductivity phase",
    ", the quark specific heat is changed exponentially@xcite @xmath22\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{k_{b}t}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is critical temperature related to @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "compare with the total mass of the stars , the mass of the crust is very small(@xmath26 ) .",
    "so we neglect its contribution to neutrino emissivity and specific heat@xcite .",
    "we consider a strange star embodied by a nuclear crust .",
    "the dh is determined by the mass change of the crust .",
    "the total heat released per unit time as a function of @xmath27 is : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , the heat release per absorbed neutron , is expected to be in the range @xmath30 .",
    "its specific value depending on the assumed sqm model , and @xmath31 is the mass of baryon .",
    "the mass of the crust @xmath32 can be approximated by a quadratic function of rotation frequency @xmath33 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the mass of the crust reads @xmath34 where @xmath35hz and @xmath36 is the mass of the crust in the static case .    assuming the spin - down is induced by the magnetic dipole radiation , the evolution of the rotation frequency @xmath33 is given by@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the stellar moment of inertia",
    ", @xmath39 is the inclination angle between magnetic and rotational axes . in our work",
    ", we combined the heating with magnetic field decay , so in eq.([nu ] ) the magnetic is denoted as a function of time .",
    "the field decay of the magnetic field is expected to be a very complicated process . for purposes of illustrate its main features , we assume a simple model equation@xcite , @xmath40 with the initial condition @xmath41 . eq.([bt])is a crude approximation",
    ", we are dealing with a typical value of the magnetic field , neglecting the spatial variation of the field throughout the crust .",
    "moreover , we adopt that the magnetic field dissipate on a time scale @xmath42",
    "considering the energy run away and heating effect of the star , the cooling equation can be written as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total specific heat , @xmath45 is the total neutrino luminosity and @xmath46 is the surface photon luminosity given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath49 is the surface temperature .",
    "the last term in eq.([ls ] ) represents the dh due to the spin - down of the star .",
    "the surface temperature of the stars is related to internal temperature by a coefficient determined by the scattering processes occurring in the crust .",
    "we apply an formula which is demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the proper surface gravity of the star in units of @xmath52@xcite . in principle",
    ", magnetic fields may change the expression of eq([ts ] ) .",
    "however , @xcite have present that the effect is negligible if the field strength is lower than @xmath53",
    ". so eq([ts])is a good approximation for our case .    considering the gravitational red - shift , and",
    "then the effective surface temperature detected by a distant observer is @xmath54^{1/2}\\ ] ] here @xmath55 is the radium of the star in units of @xmath56    we consider a canonical strange star of @xmath57 at a constant density in our work , which is a very good approximation for strange stars of mass @xmath58@xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath59 , @xmath60 , the initial temperature @xmath61 , initial period @xmath62 , initial mass of the crust @xmath63 , the magnetic tilt angle @xmath64 and the time scale @xmath65 .    using the model described in the preceding section",
    ", we plot the cooling curves of rotating strange star in normal phase with dh for various initial magnetic fields ( @xmath66 ) in fig.1 .",
    "the observational data are taken from @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath67 for @xmath68 which is a representative for the qdu process contributing to the cooling , whereas @xmath69 for @xmath70 when qmu and qb processes dominates .",
    "we also show the thermal evolution curves of strange star in cfl phase in fig.2 .",
    "in contrast to previous work@xcite , dh increases surface temperature of strange stars effectively . with constant fields ,",
    "the stars still maintain high temperature at old ages but we ca nt find such hot pulsars during the phase . in the case of field decay ,",
    "the cooling curves are exponentially suppressed at tails .",
    "this modification is very important . under consideration ,",
    "the thermal evolutionary model is compatible with the pulsar data .",
    "we have given out the cooling curves of rotating strange stars by considering the dh effect with magnetic field decay .",
    "the thermal evolution of rotating strange stars are different from previous works .",
    "the dh could increase the temperature of strange star to the inferred pulsar data while the magnetic field decay suppresses dh to retain rapid cooling at old ages(@xmath71 ) . obviously , there is no evidence for the existence of extra hot source at old age",
    ".    we should noticed that the used model of magnetic field decay which is crude .",
    "we here apply a simple magnetic field decay model .",
    "the decay time scale is taken according to statistical data of pulsar .",
    "actually , the magnetic field decay model is an endless controversial problem .",
    "the rigorous discusses may be necessary but our conclusion wo nt be changed by future study .",
