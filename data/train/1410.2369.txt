    "blazars are observed to emit highly variable non - thermal radiation spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum . the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is assumed to be dominated by emission from a relativistic jet pointing close to our line of sight .",
    "the jets in blazars consist of ultra - relativistic particles embedded in a magnetic field , with the entire plasma flowing outward from the central region with relativistic speed .",
    "the characteristic sed of blazars shows two broad non - thermal well defined continuum peaks .",
    "the first hump peaks somewhere between the infrared ( ir ) and x  ray bands , whereas the second hump exhibits a maximum at @xmath0ray energies .",
    "the origin of low energy peak is attributed to the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons in the magnetic field of the jet . in leptonic models",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0ray emission in high energy ( he : e@xmath9100 mev ) and very high energy ( vhe : e@xmath9100 gev ) regimes is attributed to the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of low energy photons by the same electron population producing the synchrotron radiation ( ssc : synchrotron self compton ) or with the possible contribution from external photons ( ec : external compton ) . in hadronic models",
    "@xcite , both electrons and protons are accelerated to ultra - relativistic energies , with protons exceeding the threshold for photo - pion production on the soft photon field in the jet . in these models ,",
    "the he and vhe @xmath0ray emissions are dominated by proton synchrotron emission , neutral pion decay photons , synchrotron and compton emission from secondary decay products of charged pions .",
    "blazars are broadly classified in two groups namely bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) @xcite .",
    "bl lacs are characterized by the weak or absence of thermal features like broad emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "on the other hand , fsrqs exhibit luminous broad emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "the peak frequency of the synchrotron component in the sed of blazars is usually used to subdivide them in 3-classes : low - synchrotron peaked ( lsp : @xmath10 hz ) , intermediate - synchrotron peaked ( isp : @xmath11 hz @xmath12",
    "@xmath13 @xmath12 @xmath14 hz ) and high - synchrotron peaked ( hsp : @xmath15 hz ) blazars @xcite .",
    "bl lacs are assumed to be good vhe candidates for ground based tev telescopes because their ic peak is in the tev regime . to date , bl lacs observed at vhe energies are predominantly high frequency peaked objects , which have been predicted as possible tev candidate blazars @xcite .",
    "blazars often show violent flux variability from radio to vhe @xmath0rays at different time scales which may or may not be correlated . therefore , simultaneous multi - wavelength ( mwl ) observations are important to understand the underlying physics of blazars .",
    "furthermore , vhe observations of blazars at cosmological distances would help in constraining the intensity and spectrum of extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , which is a very important physical quantity to understand the structure and star formation history @xcite .",
    "thus , besides their importance for study of emission mechanisms and relativistic jet dynamics , growing interest for blazar study is also motivated by the use of vhe spectra as a probe for ebl @xcite .",
    "1es 1218 + 304 ( ra:@xmath16 , dec : @xmath17 ) is an hsp bl lac object located at a redshift z = 0.182 @xcite .",
    "the source was discovered as a candidate bl lac object on the basis of its x - ray emission and was identified as x - ray source 2a 1219 + 30.5 @xcite .",
    "being an x  ray bright source , it was predicted to be a tev candidate blazar from the position of the synchrotron peak in its sed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 ( high energy gamma ray astronomy ) collaboration observed 1es 1218 + 304 during 1996 - 2002 for 3.9 h and reported an upper limit of 12@xmath2 of crab nebula flux above 750 gev @xcite .",
    "the vhe emission from 1es 1218 + 304 was first detected by the @xmath7 ( major atmospheric gamma ray imaging cherenkov ) telescope in 2005 above 120 gev @xcite .",
    "the differential energy spectrum ( d@xmath19/de = f@xmath20 e@xmath21 ) , with power law index ( @xmath22 ) of 3.0@xmath230.4 , was also reported by the @xmath7 group . in may 2006 , 1es 1218 + 304",

    "the @xmath25 ( solar tower atmospheric cherenkov effect experiment ) detector monitored 1es 1218 + 304 during 2006 - 2007 above 160 gev but did not detect any significant @xmath0ray emission from the source @xcite . in 2007 ,",

    ", @xmath8 telescope revealed a prominent flaring activity from the source at 20@xmath2 of the crab nebula flux above 200 gev @xcite .",
    "the time averaged differential energy spectrum , in the energy range 0.2 - 1.8 tev , was found to be a power law with index of 3.07@xmath230.09 .",
    "this flaring activity was characterized by a variability time scale of days .",
    "the corrected spectrum after accounting for absorption due to ebl suggests a very hard intrinsic source spectrum with index @xmath26 1.28@xmath230.28 @xcite in vhe regime based on lower limit ebl model @xcite .    _",
    "fermi_-lat ( large area telescope ) also detected significant emission from 1es 1218 + 304 during its first two years of operation @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi_-lat spectrum of the source is described by a power law with index 1.71@xmath230.07 , making it one of the hardest spectrum sources in mev - gev range .",
    "due to relatively large redshift of the source , we expect a significant attenuation of tev photons above 1 tev due to ebl absorption .",
    "this makes the source a good candidate for probing ebl using tev observations .",
    "it is because of these characteristics of the source we were motivated to observe the source with @xmath1 ( tev atmospheric cherenkov telescope with imaging camera ) in the tev energy region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives a brief description of the @xmath1 telescope and in section 3 we present details of observation and data analysis . in section 4",
    "we present the mwl data analysis of the source from radio to he . in section 5",
    "we discuss the results and the conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "the @xmath1 @xmath0ray telescope is located at mount abu ( 1300 m asl , @xmath27n , @xmath28e ) , india @xcite . the telescope is equipped with a f/1-type tessellated light collector of approximately 9.5 @xmath29 area consisting of 34 front - face aluminium coated , spherical glass mirror facets of 60 cm diameter .",
    "the point - spread function has a full width at half maxima ( fwhm ) of 0.185@xmath30 ( @xmath3112.5 mm ) and d@xmath32 @xmath330.34@xmath30 ( @xmath3122.8 mm ) . here",
    ", d@xmath32 is defined as the diameter of a circle , concentric with the centroid of the image , within which 90@xmath2 of reflected rays lie .",
    "the telescope deploys a 349-pixel imaging camera , with a uniform pixel resolution of @xmath34 and a @xmath35 field - of - view , to record atmospheric cherenkov events produced by an incoming cosmic - ray particle or a @xmath0-ray photon .",
    "data used in this work have been collected with inner 225 pixels where the innermost 121 pixels ( 11 @xmath36 11 matrix ) are used for generating the event trigger .",
    "the trigger scheme is based on a nearest neighbour non - collinear triplets trigger criterion . apart from generating the prompt trigger with a coincidence gate width of @xmath3718ns",
    ", the trigger generator has a provision for producing a chance coincidence output based on @xmath38@xmath39 combinations from various groups of closely spaced 12 channels .",
    "the data acquisition and control system of the telescope is designed around a network of pcs running the qnx ( version 4.25 ) real - time operating system .",
    "the triggered events are digitized by camac based 12-bit charge to digital converters ( cdc ) , which have a full scale range of 600 pc .",
    "the relative gain of the photomultiplier tubes is monitored regularly once in 15 minutes by flashing a blue led , placed at a distance of about 1.5 m from the camera .",
    "other details regarding hardware and software features of the data acquisition and control system of the telescope are discussed in @xcite .",
    "major upgrade , involving replacement of signal and high voltage cables and installation of new compound parabolic concentrators ( cpc ) was taken up in november - december 2011 for improving the sensitivity of the telescope . while detailed simulation and experimental results on the crab nebula , after upgrade will be presented elsewhere , we present here only a brief summary of the upgrade work . new cpcs with square entry and circular exit aperture were installed on the @xmath1 imaging camera in order to increase its photon collection efficiency .",
    "the collection efficiency of the new cpcs was measured to be about 80@xmath2 in the wavelength range 400550 nm . apart from removing the dead space in between the photomultipliers substantially ,",
    "the new cpcs has also helped us to improve the gamma / hadron segregation capability of the telescope .",
    "in addition , the trigger criteria was also modified by including more nearest neighbor collinear triplet combinations .",
    "a dedicated ccd camera was also installed for conducting detailed point run calibrations and data collected were successfully used for determining the position of the source in the image plane with an accuracy better than @xmath23 3 arc min .",
    "the point run calibration data ( i.e. position of the star image in the camera ) were also incorporated in the analysis software so that appropriate corrections can be applied in an off line manner while calculating source position dependent image parameters .",
    "the analysis procedure was improved by using the asymmetry parameter so that additional hadronic background can be further removed by identifying the `` head / tail '' feature of cherenkov images .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the @xmath0ray images have their head closer to the assumed source position in the imaging camera and thus can be selected preferentially by imposing asymmetry @xmath90 cut .",
    "the upgrade of the telescope has led to an increase in the prompt coincidence rate from 2.33 hz to 4.70 hz close to the zenith .",
    "furthermore , as a result of the upgrade the @xmath0ray rate from the crab nebula has also increased from 9.13 h@xmath5 to 15.30 h@xmath5 and this translates to the reduction in the telescope threshold energy from 1.2 tev to 0.87 tev .",
    "the blazar 1es 1218 + 304 was monitored with the @xmath1 from march 1 , 2013 to april 15 , 2013 ( mjd 5635256397 ) at zenith angles between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "all the data were collected in tracking mode , during which the telescope continuously monitored the source .",
    "this mode of observation maximizes the source observation time and increases the possibility of detecting flaring activity from the source .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present results of tev @xmath0ray observations of the high synchrotron peaked bl lac object 1es 1218 + 304 ( z=0.182 ) with the @xmath1 ( tev atmospheric cherenkov telescope with imaging camera ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observations are primarily motivated by the unusually hard gev - tev spectrum of the source despite its relatively large redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the source is observed in the tev energy range with the @xmath1 from march 1 , 2013 to april 15 , 2013 ( mjd 5635256397 ) for a total observation time of 39.62 h and no evidence of tev @xmath0ray activity is found from the source . the corresponding 99@xmath2 confidence level upper limit on the integral flux above a threshold energy of 1.1 tev is estimated to be 3.41 @xmath3 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( i.e @xmath6 crab nebula flux ) assuming a power law differential energy spectrum with photon index 3.0 , as previously observed by the @xmath7 and @xmath8 telescopes . for the study of multi - wavelength emission from the source , we use nearly simultaneous optical , uv and and x  ray data collected by the uvot and xrt instruments on board the _ swift _ satellite and high energy @xmath0ray data collected by the large area telescope on board the _ fermi _ satellite . </S>",
