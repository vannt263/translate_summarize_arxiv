    "the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite of anderson type , occurring in systems without interactions having randomly distributed on - site impurities , is related to electron localization in disordered systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mott - hubbard mit is caused by correlations arising from coulomb interactions in a disorder - free system @xcite .",
    "both types of mit have been extensively explored on its own framework and also when coulomb correlations and on - site disordered potentials are simultaneously involved @xcite .",
    "then , if the disorder is intense enough , the mott - hubbard mit will naturally take anderson - localization effects into account .",
    "the interplay between disorder and coulomb correlations in electronic systems of narrow band is of great interest since the experimental control of charge concentration through doping and undesired charged impurities in the background generates coulomb disorder scattering @xcite . for models where",
    "coulomb interactions are considered locally , such as the ones described by the hubbard @xcite and the falikov - kimball model @xcite , coulomb disorder should also be taken into account when considering a random medium which gives rise to anderson localization phenomena .",
    "hence , in this work we consider the electron - electron coupling strengths to have a random distribution across the lattice and we investigate how anderson and coulomb disorder can mutually contribute to the mit , in the framework of the falicov - kimball model .",
    "this model was introduced @xcite in order to describe the mit in transition - metal compounds and rare - earth materials .",
    "it basically assumes that there are two species of particles ( fermions ) .",
    "one is free to hop among nearest - neighbor sites , the other one is frozen , and they experience a local coulomb interaction . apart from being the simplest framework for describing a mit induced by electronic correlations , the falicov - kimball model has also a much broader appeal which includes , to name a few , the study of crystallization @xcite , order - disorder transition in binary alloys @xcite , charge transport @xcite , and itinerant magnetism @xcite . in the anderson - falicov - kimball model @xcite , a local random potential",
    "is included thus disturbing the propagation of free fermions . in order to turn the model more realistic",
    ", we will also consider disorder in the coulomb repulsion , i.e. , the interaction strength between free and frozen fermion species in each site is randomly distributed along the lattice .",
    "the model including both sources of disorder is solved within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite formalism .",
    "a great review on the dfmt applied directly on the falicov - kimball model as well as on the model itself can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . by increasing the coulomb interaction strength ,",
    "the model captures several aspects of the mott - hubbard mit as the local density of states ( ldos ) for mobile fermions splits into two sub - bands , leading to a correlation gap at the fermi level .",
    "an open gap ( forbidden energy range ) in the density of states at the fermi level characterizes the mott - hubbard mit .",
    "the most likely value of the ldos exhibits a discontinuity when the system is going through an anderson transition . along these lines",
    ", it is expected that both types of mit can be detected by evaluating the ldos .",
    "although this quantity is not an order parameter associated with a symmetry breaking of the phase transition @xcite , it discriminates between a metallic and an insulator phase .    in a disordered system , an appropriate average of the random quantities of interest",
    "must be performed in order to describe the ldos",
    ". however , the underlying probability distribution function is not completely known in most of the situations , but only certain averages . around the anderson - mit boundary , for instance ,",
    "a witness for localization can be provided by evaluating the geometric mean .",
    "this last , in contrast with the arithmetic mean which is noncritical and does not enable the distinction between localized and extended states , gives a better approximation for the ldos average as it vanishes at the critical disorder value .",
    "however , by using both averages , each in its the appropriate regime , we are allowed to provide a good description of the phase diagram and most of the relevant information regarding the effects of disorder in the mit can then be accessed . in what follows",
    "[ secii ] , the anderson - falicov - kimball model with coulomb disorder is introduced and solved within the dmft . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] , the phase diagrams are presented and the interplay between both sources of disorder are discussed .",
    "final remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] .",
    "the falicov - kimball model @xcite describes two species of spinless fermions : one is free to move and the other is trapped due to its infinite mass .",
    "there is a local coulomb interaction between these two particles and the pauli exclusion principle assures that no more than one particle ( of a given type ) is allowed to occupy the same site .",
    "here we consider two kinds of disorder , a local random anderson - like impurity and coulomb disorder .",
    "this allows us to explore the features in the mit provided by the competition between these two sources of disorder .",
    "the system s hamiltonian is then expressed by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hopping transfer integral for fermions moving between nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are , respectively , the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the mobile and trapped fermions at site @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the chemical potential for the mobile fermions .",
    "@xmath8 is the local impurity and @xmath9 denotes the local coulomb interaction strength between trapped and mobile fermions .",
    "these two aforementioned quantities are randomly distributed through the lattice , being characterized by a probability distribution function of the form @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the step function , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) measures the amount of anderson ( coulomb ) disorder , and @xmath15 is the mean value of the coulomb interaction strength .",
    "here , we deal only with a repulsive interaction , @xmath16 , which leads to @xmath17 .",
    "the mean particle number for the mobile and trapped fermions at the @xmath6th site are given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , and are independent from each other .",
    "the changes caused by coulomb disorder in the phase diagram of the anderson - falicov - kimball model , i.e. how it drives the mit , will be explored in the framework of dmft in the following sections .",
    "the equations of motion for hamiltonian ( [ eq01 ] ) are expressed by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the green s functions for the single and double particle states @xcite , and @xmath23 is the kronecker delta function .",

    "the green s functions must be solved by taking into account the averages for which the translational invariance can be restored .",

    "therefore , @xmath41 , where the energy is expressed in units of the band width . in eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) , it was assumed that the band is half - filled , i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , the chemical potential was set to @xmath44 in order to fix the band center to lie in @xmath45 .",
    "the quantum states corresponding to the band center can determine the ground - state properties for the half - filled case .",
    "in the mit , for example , the ldos vanishes at this point .",
    "when the system is in the metallic phase , the ldos is arbitrarily small in the vicinity of the mit region .",
    "hence , the transition points on the phase diagram can be determined by linearizing the dmft equations @xcite .    in the band center , the green s function is purely imaginary , @xmath46 , due to the symmetry of @xmath47 thus leading to the recursive relation @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath49 , by using eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) we can obtain the dmft recursive relation @xmath50 where @xmath51 the boundary between metallic and insulating phases can be obtained when the condition @xmath52 is satisfied .",

    "( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) and evaluating the averages on @xmath28 and @xmath9 , we finally obtain the expressions which determine the mit for both arithmetic and geometric means , respectively , @xmath53 @xmath54 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "now we investigate the system s phase diagrams obtained from the dfmt scheme discussed in the previous section .",
    "the ldos was evaluated for a variety of parameters as it gives information about the allowed states on the system .",
    "for instance , the ground - state properties can be analysed from the following outcomes of @xmath55 and @xmath56 at the band center @xmath45 @xcite : i ) @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote a metallic phase ; ii ) @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 indicate a mott - insulator phase ; and iii ) for @xmath57 and @xmath62 there is anderson localization without a mott gap .",
    "there are also coexistent phases which will not be highlighted in this work .",
    "all these situations occur for appropriate sets of @xmath15 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 and give rise to a rich phase diagram .    in the case where no coulomb disorder is considered ( @xmath63 ) @xcite ,",
    "the metallic phase is identified for small values of @xmath15 and @xmath13 , the mott - insulator phase stabilizes as we increase @xmath15 , and anderson localization naturally overcomes for large @xmath13 .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where we compare the phase diagrams evaluated at the band center with and without coulomb disorder .        for the latter case",
    ", three different interaction regimes can be identified @xcite regarding the metallic and mott phase boundaries ( see the small arrows at the @xmath15-axis in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : weak ( @xmath64 ) , intermediate ( @xmath65 ) , and strong ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "when @xmath67 , these regimes still hold but for different critical values , with the intermediate one shrinking as @xmath14 increases .",
    "the left side of the vertical dotted lines indicates a non - physical region as we are dealing with @xmath68 only .",
    "thus , in fig . [ fig1 ] we see the major effect of including coulomb disorder into the problem , which is to drive the system to the anderson localized phase .",
    "all the critical curves presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] were obtained directly from eqs .",
    "( [ critical_arith ] ) and ( [ critical_geom ] ) , however , it is worth pointing out that the numerical results obtained by solving the self - consistent equations of dmft absolutely matches with those from the linearised dmft .",
    "the above analysis was performed for the band center .",
    "nevertheless , it is relevant to also observe the effects of coulomb disorder in the whole band . for this",
    ", we study the ldos by proceeding with a similar analysis for the entire set of @xmath69 solving the self - consistent equations of dmft ( without resorting to the linearized dmft ) .    at the weak interaction regime ,",
    "the mott gap is not available and the system is in the metallic phase as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . by increasing @xmath13",
    "we reduce the density of states at the center of the band , @xmath70 , thus making the spectrum of gapless extended states narrower and expanding the total bandwidth @xcite . for this weak regime ,",

    "localized states with no gap ( anderson insulator ) can be detected in a thin energy band between the band gap and metallic states for @xmath72 and @xmath67 .",
    "however , this phase diagram is qualitatively similar to that obtained for the anderson model with no interaction @xcite . therefore , at the weak interaction regime , a uniform or disordered distribution of coulomb coupling strengths have no major effects in the system s properties .    as @xmath15 increases",
    ", the mott gap starts to rise . at this point , we have reached the intermediate interaction regime as depicted earlier in fig .",
    "both sources of disorder can take the system out of this mott phase .",
    "in contrast with the previous weak interaction case , coulomb disorder now has a significant role on the spectral density as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for a fixed amount of anderson disorder @xmath13 .",
    "coulomb disorder decreases the ldos [ this effect turns to be clearer for the geometric mean in fig .",

    "phase diagrams describing the metal - insulator phase transition in the falicov - kimball model with anderson and coulomb disorder were obtained by means of the dmft .",
    "coulomb disorder has been shown to add new features into the problem as it directly affects the spectral density by decreasing its intensity and increasing the total bandwidth as @xmath14 is increased . even in the absence of structural disorder , it is possible to observe localized states with no gap .",
    "we showed that the critical values associated with the mit change as the intensity of coulomb disorder is tuned , thus turning the system insulator - like if this source of disorder and/or the electronic interaction are strong enough .",
