    "partial differential equations with nonlocal or fractional operators are widely used to model scientific problems in mechanics , physics , signal processing and other subjects , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "we consider in this paper a nonlocal conservation law which appears in the formation and dynamics of sand structures such as dunes and ripples @xcite .",
    "namely , fowler ( @xcite ) introduced the following equation [ fowler1 ] @xmath0 ( x )   - \\partial^2_{xx } u(t , x ) = 0 & t \\in ( 0,t ) , x \\in { \\mathbb{r } } , \\\\",

    "the nonlocal term appears after a subtle modeling of the basal shear stress .",
    "this operator appears also in the work of kouakou & lagre @xcite .",

    "one simple way to establish this fact is the derivation of a new formula for the operator @xmath4 @xcite @xmath7(x)= c_{{\\mathcal{i } } } \\int_{-\\infty}^{0 } \\frac{\\varphi(x+z)-\\varphi(x)-\\varphi'(x ) z}{|z|^{7/3 } } \\ : dz,\\label{intformula}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 .",

    "for this purpose , the following cauchy problem solved by the perturbation @xmath29 has been considered : @xmath30(x ) - \\partial^2_{xx } v(t , x ) = 0 & t \\in ( 0,t ) , x \\in { \\mathbb{r } } , \\\\",

    "we must be careful to distinguish between the instability which stems from the model and numerical instabilities , which could be caused by a careless discretization .",
    "+ the numerical stability ensures that the difference between the approximate solution and the exact solution remains bounded for increasing @xmath46 for @xmath110 given . + as noticed",
    ", the fowler model amplifies slowly the low frequencies whereas the high frequencies are quickly dampened .",
    "thus , the classical notion of @xmath111-stability ( strong stability ) and @xmath45-stability are not suitable nor desirable .",
