    "the financial crisis started in 2007 highlighted , once again , the high degree of interdependence of financial systems .",
    "a combination of excessive borrowing , risky investments , lack of transparency and high interdependence led the financial system to the worst financial meltdown since the great depression ( fcic @xcite ) .",
    "an increasing interest in financial contagion , motivated by the crisis , gave rise to several works in this field in the last years , although the subject is not new .",
    "the interdependence of financial systems exhibits multiple channels .",
    "financial institutions are connected through mutual exposures created in the interbank market , through which institutions with surplus liquidity can lend to those with liquidity shortage . while the interbank market is responsible for efficient liquidity allocation , it also introduces the possibility for credit risk via financial contagion .",
    "insolvency of one bank can propagate through its links leading to insolvency of other banks .",
    "equally important , financial institutions are indirectly connected by holding similar assets exposures and by sharing the same mass of depositors .    with respect to the direct connections of mutual exposures , the structure of interdependence can be easily captured by using a network representation , in which the nodes of the network represent financial institutions , while the links represent exposures between nodes ( allen and babus @xcite ) .",
    "mutual exposures networks are directed networks in which _ in _ links stand for credits while _ out _ links represent debts . the link direction indicates the cash flow at the time of debt payment ( from debtor to creditor ) and also indicates the direction of impact or financial loss in case of default of borrowers .    theoretical studies ( allen and gale @xcite , freixas et .",
    "@xcite ) have shown that the possibility for contagion via mutual exposures depends on the precise structure of the interbank market .",
    "allen and gale @xcite assess the contagion generated from an increased demand for liquidity ( liquidity shock ) of a system consisting of 4 identical regions .",
    "they demonstrate that if the system formed by these 4 regions is a complete network , in which all nodes have connections to each other , then contagion effect is minimized .",
    "the authors argue that in complete networks the impact of a liquidity crisis in one region may be distributed among all others and thus attenuated .",
    "similar results are found by freixas et .",
    "@xcite in a model with money - centre banks .    in recent studies , different models of complex network have been used to generate artificial interbank networks , in order to identify if a given network is more or less prone to contagion .",
    "nier et al . @xcite simulate contagion from the initial failure of a bank in an erds - rnyi random network , finding a negative nonlinear relationship between contagion and the level of capitalization of banks .",
    "the relationship between contagion and connectivity is also nonlinear .",
    "an increase in the number of interbank exposures initially has no effect on contagion , since the losses are absorbed by the capital of each affected node .",
    "however , as the number of connections is raised , contagion increases until the point where further increase in connectivity cause contagion to decline .",
    "the non - monotonic relationship between connectivity and contagion found by the authors reflects the action of two effects : on the one hand , the addition of new links adds new channels through which contagion can occur . on the other hand",
    ", increasing links also represent the distribution of losses among a larger number of nodes , diluting the impact of the failure and mitigating the effects of the crisis .    studying a specific case of power - law network , cont and moussa @xcite find similar results as nier et al .",
    "@xcite for the relation between connectivity , level of capitalization and contagion .",
    "battiston et al .",
    "@xcite simulate contagion on a regular network and also find a nonlinear relationship between connectivity and contagion , but with opposite effect : initially the increase in the number of connections decreases the network contagion , while later additions make contagion to increase .",
    "the differences in the results indicate that the possibility and extent of contagion depends considerably on the structure of each network and specific assumptions of each model .",
    "empirical studies reveal that some interbank networks have features of scale - free networks : this means that the distribution of connections among banks follows a power law , @xmath0 ( boss et al .",
    "@xcite , cont et al .",
    "@xcite , soramki et al .",
    "@xcite , inaoka et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in general terms ,",
    "some of the most outstanding features reported in the literature are :    * networks have low density of links , that is , they are far from complete ; * asymmetrical in - degree and out - degree distribution ; * power law distributions for in and out - degree whose exponent varies around 2 and 3 .",
    "it is also noteworthy the characteristic reported by cont et al .",
    "@xcite in the study of the brazilian network : there is a positive association between the size of exposures ( assets ) and the number of debtors ( in - degree ) of an institution , and a positive association between the size of liabilities and the number of creditors ( out - degree ) of an institution .",
    "more ( less ) connected financial institutions have larger ( smaller ) exposures ( links weights ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to identify , through simulations of networks whose distributions approach power laws , how scale free networks behave with regard to financial contagion via mutual exposures and what characteristics make a given network more or less prone to propagate crises .",
    "our particular interest is to evaluate the role of the exponents that characterize the scale free network , since these exponents determine the concentration of debts ( out - degree ) and credits ( in - degree ) in the financial network .",
    "we construct networks whose connectivity distribution approaches a power law using the algorithm introduced by bollobs et al .",
    "@xcite , as extension of the method for network construction used by barabasi and albert @xcite .",
    "another important ingredient that we include in our analysis is to introduce a simplified model that determines the banks balance sheets from information of network connectivity ; we simulate the patrimonial structure of the financial system by dividing each balance sheet in bank assets and liabilities ( relationships with other financial agents ) and nonbank assets and liabilities ( relations with non - financial agents ) .    by varying the parameters for the creation of the network ,",
    "several interbank networks are built , in which concentrations of debts and credits are obtained from links distributions during the networks creation process .",
    "three main types of interbank network are analyzed for their resilience to contagion : i ) networks in which concentration of debts is greater than concentration of credits , ii ) networks in which concentration of credits is greater than concentration of debts and iii ) networks in which concentrations of debts and credits are similar .",
    "we also tested the effect of a variation in connectivity in conjunction with variation in concentration of links , as well as the effect of network size and the level of bank capitalization .",
    "for all networks that we have generated , the financial contagion starts from the single failure of a node , which affects neighboring nodes by default on its obligations in the interbank lending market .",
    "thus , this work focuses on the problem of credit risk , disregarding other equally important sources of contagion , as the risk of adverse shocks reaching several institutions at the same time .    some topological indices of systemic risk suggested in the literature ( cont et al .",
    "@xcite ) are evaluated in order to verify its ability to explain the impact of the failure of a node on the system .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section [ cap3 ] describes the model used for simulation of financial networks .",
    "we describe the methodology used in the construction of connections between nodes , as well as the method for the simulation of their balance sheets .",
    "section [ cap4 ] introduces the method used to simulate financial contagion and presents the impact indices , by which we evaluate the nodes in respect to their default effect . for each simulated network",
    "all nodes are analyzed individually .",
    "section [ cap5 ] presents the results of the various simulations performed by varying the parameters of the networks formation , the scale of the system ( number of nodes ) and the capital level . in section [ cap6 ]",
    "we investigate the contribution of local characteristics of the networks in explaining the level of contagion .",
    "section [ cap7 ] summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "in their study on scale free networks , barabasi and albert @xcite propose a preferential attachment mechanism to explain the emergence of the power - law degree distribution in nondirected graphs .",
    "the resulting network exhibits a few nodes with very high connectivity ( called hubs ) and a large number of nodes with a few or a single link .",
    "this is not really representative of real bank networks where there exist hubs but not so many single connected nodes .",
    "bollobs et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a modification of the algorithm : a generalization for directed networks of the model developed by barabasi and albert @xcite . in their model",
    "the network is formed by preferential attachment that depends on the distribution of in - degree , @xmath1 and out - degree @xmath2 .",
    "this algorithm has the advantage of producing different exponents for the in and out degrees , which are necessary to reproduce the characteristics of real networks ( allen and babus @xcite ) .",
    "the following describes the steps for generating the network according to bollobs et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 be non - negative real numbers such that @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be any initial network , consisted of 2 nodes , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , connected by 2 directed links , @xmath12 e @xmath13 .",
    "] , and let @xmath14 be the number of links of @xmath9 .",
    "at each step , @xmath15 , starting with @xmath16 , we add a new link to the network , so that in step @xmath15 the network has @xmath15 links and a random number of nodes , @xmath17 . at each step",
    "the addition of the new link may be accompanied or not by adding new node , according to the following method ( bollobs et al .",
    "@xcite ) :    * with probability @xmath3 , we add a new node @xmath18 with a link from @xmath18 to an existing node , @xmath19 , selected with probability : @xmath20 * with probability @xmath4 , we select an existing node @xmath18 with probability : @xmath21 and add a link from @xmath18 to an existing node @xmath19 , chosen with probability : @xmath22 * with probability @xmath5 , we add a new node @xmath19 with a link from an existing node @xmath18 to @xmath19 , where @xmath18 is selected with probability : @xmath21    where @xmath23 is the in - degree of node @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the out - degree of node @xmath26 .",
    "since the probability @xmath4 refers to the addition of a link without any creation of a node , increasing the value of @xmath4 implies increasing the average network connectivity . in turn , the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath5 are related to the addition of new nodes while increasing the connectivity of existing nodes .",
    "as stated above , for interbank networks the in - degree of a node , @xmath1 , represents its number of debtors , so large values of @xmath3 tends to generate nodes that concentrate many credits , i.e. , the most connected nodes are large creditors . in a complementary way , large values of @xmath5 ( as opposed to @xmath3 ) tend to generate large debtors nodes . on the other hand , the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent weights distributed among the nodes , causing everyone to have a chance of being selected in the attachment process .",
    "for example , with @xmath27 , even a node without any _ in _ link can be selected to receive an _ in _ link with probability :    @xmath28    the similar situation occurs when we have @xmath29 .    in their work ,",
    "bollobs et al .",
    "@xcite show that , when the number of nodes goes to infinity and the connectivity grows , we have :    @xmath30    @xmath31    where : @xmath32 @xmath33    the limit @xmath34 can obviously not be achieved , but the result is valid when the number of nodes grows and we take the more connected ones , i.e. , power laws for @xmath1 and @xmath2 will emerge in the tail of the distribution of large networks . performing several simulations using different parameter values",
    "we find that , as the network grows , the convergence to the limit values occurs from the left , i.e. , from lower values than predicted by the formulas of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we want to compare networks with different values for @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( featuring different concentrations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , while keeping other characteristics similar , such as average connectivity and total concentration of links distribution .",
    "we are particularly interested in networks whith values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 around 2 and 3 , in agreement with estimated empirical values ( for example , boss et al .",
    "@xcite , cont et al .",
    "@xcite , soramki et al .",
    "we restrict the degrees of freedom of the model , imposing the following constraints on the parameters :    @xmath37    @xmath38    for @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 . since @xmath4 is the probability of creating a link without addition of a new node , we can not use a value of @xmath4 too small , otherwise we will have a network with very low average connectivity . on the other hand , we would like to have values of @xmath3 and @xmath5 high enough for creating asymmetry between the distributions of in - degrees and out - degrees .",
    "the values @xmath39 and @xmath40 satisfy those requirements .",
    "for example , the asymmetry between the exponents estimated @xmath35 and @xmath36 for networks of 1000 nodes is apparent if we use values @xmath3 and @xmath5 in the ratio of 1:3 ( or 3:1 ) , which implies , with @xmath39 , the values @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .    also the differences between @xmath6 and @xmath7 cause asymmetry between the estimated exponents @xmath35 and @xmath36 . we use @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the both ratios 1:3 and 3:1 , in order to accentuate the asymmetry of the network .",
    "in addition to the equations [ eq : restr1 ] and [ eq : restr2 ] , we will cover the spaces of parameters @xmath45 e @xmath46 by varying the following radial lines :    @xmath47    the intersection points of equation [ eq : radiais ] with the constraints [ eq : restr1 ] and [ eq : restr2 ] give us the set ( @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , which in turn define pairs ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) as shown in figure [ fig : parametros ] .     and",
    "@xmath46 are represented with origin in the upper right corner and the space of exponents @xmath48 with origin at the bottom left.,width=453 ]    using the equations [ eq : restr1 ] , [ eq : restr2 ] and [ eq : radiais ] we restate the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 e @xmath7 as functions of @xmath6 : @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 replacing expressions [ eq : parametrica1 ] , [ eq : parametrica2 ] and [ eq : parametrica3 ] in the equations for @xmath35 e @xmath36 respectively , we obtain the two parametric equations : @xmath52 @xmath53 from which we finally have : @xmath54    the networks constructed using relationship [ eq : curva ] are therefore generated through variation of a single degree of freedom , having similar average connectivity and link concentration ( limited by the constraints [ eq : restr1 ] and [ eq : restr2 ] ) , differing in the value of pairs @xmath55 . as we reported above , the exponent of a power law distribution reflects the concentration of the distribution : a smaller absolute value of the exponent corresponds to a more concentrated distribution ( kunegis and preusse@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , differences between exponents @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent differences between the concentrations in _ in - out _ degree distribution .    for our studies of contagion we selected three points on the curve in figure [ fig : parametros ] ( equation [ eq : curva ] ) , representing three distinct networks , denominated as @xmath56 , @xmath57 e @xmath58 .",
    "the network @xmath56 is more concentrated in debtor side : with a higher concentration of debts than credits it is generated so that the largest banks in the network are major debtors of the system .",
    "the network @xmath58 has higher concentration of credits : the biggest banks are major creditors of the network .",
    "the network @xmath57 corresponds to the symmetric case , in which the concentration of debts and credits are similar .",
    "the limit values @xmath55 for these networks are shown in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    ".limit values ? ?",
    "of the exponents @xmath35 e @xmath36 , average connectivity and gini index for three selected networks . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for networks @xmath59 and @xmath60 the lowest concentration of links causes worsening of the indices of contagion .",
    "for such networks the negative effect of the reduction in concentration of credits is superior to the positive effect of reducing the concentration of debts .    for networks @xmath61",
    "the @xmath62 index shows a slight improvement ( from 0.48 to 0.46 ) , whereas the index @xmath63 has a slight worsening ( 0.99 to 1.01 ) , indicating that in this case the two effects are balanced .",
    "figures [ fig : perfis_di ] e [ fig : perfis_dc ] summarize the results of this section presenting the values of @xmath62 e @xmath63 for the 5 types of network analyzed .",
    "comparisons among types suggests that for networks constructed with the algorithm of bollobs et al . @xcite and with exposures positively related to connectivity , the best scenario is that of a more connected network with high concentration of credits , featuring large creditors nodes which act as stabilizers of the network .",
    "it should be emphasized again that in comparisons among network types performed in this work , we do not consider differences among nodes regarding their probabilities of default , differences that can change the evaluation of each network type .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the financial contagion via mutual exposures in the interbank market through simulations of networks whose degree distributions follows power laws .",
    "we have seen that among the measures of systemic importance ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , _ default cascade _ ( @xmath63 ) is the one that most differentiates the categories of network analyzed .",
    "we also observe that , for all categories , both the _ default impact _ and _ default cascade _ of each node alone does not reach large percentage of the network assets and number of nodes , respectively .",
    "this result is in agreement with the results of stress tests on empirical networks ( upper , c. @xcite ) .",
    "although contagion generated by the failure of an individual node has been shown to be of small amplitude , the differences found among network types may be relevant in the event of market shocks that affect capital of several institutions simultaneously , which would make the system more vulnerable to contagion .",
    "comparisons among types of network suggest that , for networks whose distributions are close to power laws and exposure is positively related to connectivity , the best scenario is one with a more connected network with high concentration of credits , featuring large creditors nodes which act as stabilizers of the network .",
    "this results suggests that the asymmetry observed in distributions of certain real networks is a positive factor , as long as the network be more concentrated in distribution of credits ( _ in _ links ) . in real networks having power laws exponents estimated between 2 and 3 ,",
    "the results imply that the most stable networks are those with distribution of _ in _ links with exponent 2 and distribution of _ out _ links with exponent 3 .",
    "as expected , the increase of capital level reduces contagion in all three categories of network , since the equity of banks absorbs impacts suffered by them .",
    "we also observed that larger networks have nodes with less potential for contagion , situation already observed in previous works ( cont and moussa @xcite ) .",
    "our simulation shows that the _ default impact _ is strongly determined by the _ initial impact _ , which was expected , since the assets of large banks ( greater initial impact ) represent significant portion of the network assets .",
    "however , the _ initial impact _ does not determines the _ default cascade _ to the same extent : _ default cascade _ appears to be more sensitive to characteristics of local connectivity .",
    "the results suggest that the size of the balance sheet is the most important factor in determining the impact on assets resulting from the failure of a node , and should not be disregarded or replaced by topological measures that reflect only information of network connectivity . on the other hand , the network structure has important consequences on the _ default cascade_. in some cases , the banks which trigger the largest cascades are not the ones with greater balance sheet . for those banks , topological measures such as _ local network frailty _ are good indicators of their systemic importance .",
