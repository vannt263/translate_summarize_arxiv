    "topological properties of a system are often important in investigating the dynamics of the system .",
    "it seems certain that m - theory@xcite has membranes as dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the only existing proposal for formulation of m - theory , namely the matrix model of m - theory@xcite , can be considered as an attempt to define quantum membrane theory  @xcite .",
    "more explicitly stated , it is a regularized version of membrane theory in lightcone gauge , dynamical variables becoming @xmath0 matrices instead of functions defined on two - dimensional worldspace .    but ,",
    "at present , the topological properties of membranes in m - theory are not known .",
    "the concern of this paper is membrane topology which has genus @xmath1 . ] in the matrix model .",
    "it is believed that the matrix model can describe membranes of arbitrary topologies .",
    "however , there has been a problem : we do not know whether and how the information of the topology manifests itself in the matrix model .",
    "the cause for this problem lies in the manner in which the correspondence between matrices and functions has been given .",
    "there has been no unique rule that can deal with all membrane topologies .",
    "instead , we have many different rules for different topologies @xcite , interrelationships between those rules being unclear .    in this paper",
    ", we address this problem by reexamining the regularization procedure , the so - called matrix regularization .",
    "we shall show that the information indeed manifests itself in the eigenvalue distribution of a single matrix .",
    "the precise manner of the manifestation will be described .",
    "moreover , we have constructed a new correspondence rule between functions and matrices which can be applied to all membrane topologies in a unified way .",
    "we start by discussing relevant aspects of matrix regularization , in section [ smatreg ] .",
    "we take the simple view that , classically , the matrix regularization is an approximation of continuum theory by a discretized theory .",
    "theory carefully .",
    "] this approximation between two theories is based solely on some fundamental large-@xmath2 approximation formulae ( [ appnrm])-([appbra ] ) .",
    "they play a vital role in this paper .",
    "we also recall the well - known mathematical analogy between the matrix regularization and canonical quantization of systems with one degree of freedom , which will be our main tool in subsequent discussions .",
    "then , in section [ stop ] , we turn to the investigation of membrane topology in the matrix model .",
    "our basic observation is that , in order to study membrane topology , it suffices to consider the two - dimensional base space , which we shall term as the @xmath3-space , not the shape of the membranes in the target space .",
    "this observation greatly simplifies the analysis , since it enables us to deal with only a single matrix , not many matrices .",
    "we base the discussion on the analog of the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition .",
    "we shall show that , in the case where the fundamental approximations hold well , the eigenvalue distribution of a matrix has a particular structure .",
    "namely , the set of all eigenvalues can be decomposed into subsets characterized by the following property : the eigenvalues in one of the subsets , when sorted , increase smoothly .",
    "we call these subsets as eigenvalue sequences .",
    "the grouping of the eigenvalues into sequences reveals a branching phenomenon of sequences .",
    "we find that the branching phenomenon , in turn , reflects certain morse - theoretic information of topology of the @xmath3-space .",
    "this is our answer to the above problem .",
    "thus , the information of topology manifests itself , in the world of matrices , as a branching phenomenon of eigenvalue sequences .",
    "furthermore , the notion of eigenvalue sequences enables us to construct a new correspondence rule between matrices and functions , which is the subject in section [ smrcorr ] .",
    "the matrix elements are approximately equal to fourier components of the corresponding function , calculated along appropriate orbits on the @xmath3-space .",
    "the rule is analogous to the correspondence noticed by heisenberg when he created matrix mechanics pursuing bohr s correspondence principle@xcite .",
    "there , the matrix elements of an observable , in the basis which makes the hamiltonian diagonal , are equal to the classical fourier components of the observable along the appropriate classical orbits on the phase space .",
    "we shall show that the fundamental approximation formulae hold well if the new correspondence rule holds .",
    "the correspondence rule contains the above - mentioned analog of the bohr - sommerfeld condition .",
    "this justifies the use of it in section [ stop ] .",
    "the new rule is semi - local in the @xmath3-space , and consequently can be applied for all membrane topologies uniformly , in marked contrast with the previously known rules .",
    "this , in particular , enables one to construct functions corresponding to given matrices when the approximations are good . using previous rules",
    ", one could only do the reverse , namely , to construct matrices corresponding to given functions .",
    "this is because one could not know the topology corresponding to the given matrices , and therefore could not choose the rule to be used .    apart from the unified treatment for all topologies , the new rule has the virtue that the identification of the matrix elements with fourier components is direct , and so that the geometrical meanings of the matrix elements are clear .",
    "our arguments are also relevant to the matrix model of type iib string theory @xcite , since the same regularization is involved .",
    "further , the same kind of mathematics as that of matrix regularization appears in such subjects as bound states of d - branes or non - commutative field theory .",
    "ideas in this paper may find some applications in those subjects .",
    "a few illustrative numerical examples are given in section [ snumex ] .",
    "the consistency between our new rule and previous rules is checked by studying them .",
    "finally , we conclude with some discussions in section [ scondis ] .",
    "let us briefly recall the matrix regularization procedure from our viewpoint .",
    "although it is supermembrane theory in eleven dimension @xcite that is relevant to m - theory , we consider bosonic membrane theory for simplicity of presentation .",
    "firstly , we shall describe the continuum theory .",
    "we parametrize the membranes by three parameters @xmath4 .",
    "then , the geometrical shape of membranes in spacetime is described by the coordinate functions @xmath5 . in lightcone",
    "gauge formalism , @xmath6 is chosen to be equal to @xmath7 , and @xmath3 is chosen so as to make the area of a domain in the @xmath3-space proportional to total @xmath8 contained in the domain . here",
    ", we denote the momentum density vector of the membranes by @xmath9 .",
    "the canonical variables of the system are transverse coordinates and momenta ( which are functions defined on the @xmath3-space ) as well as zero modes , x^( ) , p^( ) ; x^- , -p^+.[conticanvar ] the hamiltonian is given by h=[ ] d^2 , [ contih ] with lie brackets @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are functions on the @xmath3-space .",
    "we have also introduced a conventional constant @xmath13 $ ] which is the total area of the @xmath3-space , @xmath13 = \\int d^2\\ss$ ] .",
    "the remaining ingredients of the theory are the phase space constraints \\{x^ , p^}()=0,[conticon ] and its global version .",
    "they correspond to the local symmetry of the lightcone gauge theory under reparametrization by area - preserving diffeomorphism ( apd ) on the @xmath3-space .",
    "this is a local symmetry , because one can perform reparametrization by different apd for different @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , we shall give the regularized theory .",
    "the canonical variables are @xmath14 matrices as well as zero modes , ^,^ ; x^- , -p^+.[regcanvar ] the hamiltonian is given by h= n,[regh ] and the constraints are , = 0,[regcon ] where @xmath15 $ ] is a commutator of matrices .",
    "now , we turn to the explanation of the matrix regularization .",
    "the following fact is essential : there exists a correspondence between appropriate functions on the @xmath3-space @xmath16 and matrices @xmath17 such that the fundamental approximation formulae f( ) d^2  & & [ appnrm ] + & & [ appmtp ] + & & -i [ , ] [ appbra ] hold . here",
    ", we denote by @xmath18 and @xmath19 the matrices which correspond to the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    ", for the sake of completeness .",
    "we have omitted it since it holds trivially in all our discussions . ]",
    "the larger is @xmath2 , the better is the approximation . from these formulae",
    "it follows that the continuum theory , defined by ( [ conticanvar])-([conticon ] ) can be approximated by a regularized theory defined by ( [ regcanvar])-([regcon ] ) .",
    "we stress the importance of above formulae .",
    "they are almost the definition of the matrix regularization .",
    "since lie brackets and matrix commutators both obey the jacobi identity and antisymmetry , the important advantage of matrix regularization follows .",
    "namely , the regularized theory has local symmetry under the transformation x^()=u()x^ ( ) u()^-1 ,   p^()=u()p^ ( ) u()^-1 , [ locsymmat ] where @xmath22 is an arbitrary matrix which is a function of @xmath6 , corresponding to the apd symmetry in continuum theory .",
    "the matrix regularization procedure is analogous to the quantization of a system which has one degree of freedom , as is well known .",
    "the analogy can be summarized as ,    c|c & + ( x , p ) & ( ^1,^2 ) + & + \\ {  ,  } _ p.b . -i [  ,  ] & \\ {  ,  } -i [  ,  ] + & +    [ analogytable ] where @xmath23 is the usual poisson brackets .",
    "we shall motivate our discussion by this analogy in section [ stop ] .",
    "we conclude this section with discussions on the previously known correspondence rules .",
    "we first recall the general manner the rules are formulated .",
    "we must , first of all , fix topology of the @xmath3-space .",
    "after that , we consider a basis in the vector space of all functions defined on the @xmath3-space .",
    "then , we define an appropriate basis in the vector space of all @xmath0 matrices , and postulate a correspondence between it and the basis in the space of the functions appropriately truncated .",
    "the rules are , finally , justified by checking that the fundamental approximations ( [ appnrm])-([appbra ] ) hold well for large @xmath2 by them .",
    "this manner has made difficult to consider whether and how membrane topology manifests itself in the matrix model .",
    "in particular , one can expand an arbitrary matrix by basis referring to any particular topology .",
    "this fact , at first sight , seems to suggest that a configuration of matrix model could be interpreted as membranes of arbitrary topology , and there would be , therefore , no information of topology in the matrix model .",
    "this is not necessarily true .",
    "even if one can formally expand some matrices by a basis referring to a particular topology , the fundamental approximations may not work at all.[multiblock footnote omitted ] in our perspective , that the matrix regularization is an approximation scheme , we can not , then , interpret the matrices as membranes of the particular topology .",
    "information of topology may be hidden in the matrices in this way . through sections [ stop ] and [ smrcorr ] , we shall see indeed that , provided that the approximations are good , the information reflects in the eigenvalue distribution .",
    "in this section , we show that the information of membrane topology manifests itself in the matrix model . before explicit description of the manner of the manifestation , let us give some basic observations .",
    "if one wishes to specify the complete shape of membranes in the target space , one needs information of many ( that is , roughly speaking , as many as the dimension of the target space ) functions .",
    "this would imply that one should study many matrices in the matrix model .",
    "however , the information of membrane topology , or at least the information of topology of the @xmath3-space , is contained in one generic function defined on the @xmath3-space , as is strongly suggested by morse theory .",
    "we choose , as our basic strategy , to consider the latter information .",
    "then , we shall seek in a single matrix the information of topology of the @xmath3-space .",
    "there is another point we would like to discuss .",
    "it is most natural to identify functions which are transformed into each other by apd transformations .",
    "we shall identify those matrices which are transformed into each other by similarity transformations , since ( [ appbra ] ) tells us that the counterpart of the apd transformation is the similarity transformation .",
    "this has some non - triviality , since it may happen that the identification is only allowed approximately .",
    "nonetheless , we shall carry out the identification , because that the apd symmetry survives as ( [ locsymmat ] ) is the most important advantage of the matrix regularization .",
    "this identification and our strategy , to consider the topology of the @xmath3-space , act together to greatly simplify the analysis .",
    "since one can always diagonalize a single matrix , we can concentrate on the eigenvalue distribution of the matrix .",
    "having explained our basic strategy , we shall now proceed to investigate the manner of the manifestation of membrane topology in the eigenvalue distribution .",
    "first , let us consider how one can read off the information of topology from a function in an apd invariant way .",
    "we choose an arbitrary generic function @xmath24 .",
    "it could be one of the transverse coordinates , for instance .",
    "the function is fixed , throughout our discussion , as a kind of reference .",
    "thus , we shall use @xmath11 , shortly below , as both an analog of the hamiltonian in canonical quantization and a morse function . as a natural apd - invariant concept with a given function @xmath24",
    ", we introduce an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) =\\ {  , f } [ eomonss ] , drawing analogy to the hamiltonian equation of motion with a given hamiltonian function @xmath25 , which is invariant under canonical transformations .",
    "this ode governs the motion of points of the @xmath3-space .",
    ", is just a mathematical tool to substantiate the analogy to canonical quantization .",
    "it has nothing to do with physical time coordinates of membrane theory . ]",
    "thus , we envisage an auxiliary hamiltonian - like dynamical system with the @xmath3-space as its phase space and with @xmath11 as its hamiltonian . since @xmath11 is conserved along the motion by the identity @xmath26 , an orbit of this equation is a part of an equal-@xmath11 line in the @xmath3-space .",
    "it will form a closed loop because of the compactness of the @xmath3-space .",
    "-space which has topology of a torus .",
    "the height in the figure is the reference function .",
    "some orbits of the ode @xmath27 are drawn , which form closed loops that are , in turn , parts of the equal-@xmath11 lines .",
    "if one gradually increases the value of @xmath11 , one observes a branching phenomenon of the orbits : appearing , branching , merging , and disappearing processes at the points a , b , c , and d , respectively .",
    "depicted is essentially the @xmath3-space , so that the horizontal directions of the figure have rather arbitrary meanings .",
    "if one wishes , one can also give definite meanings to the horizontal directions by interpreting this figure as the geometrical shape of a membrane in the target space , and the reference function as one of the coordinate functions . ]",
    "then , if we scan the @xmath3-space by gradually increasing the value of @xmath11 , we will observe branching processes of these orbits .",
    "there are four types of these branching processes : appearing , disappearing , branching and merging .",
    "let us consider , for a typical example , the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ ftorus ] .",
    "the membrane topology is that of a torus .",
    "the reference function @xmath11 is chosen to be the height in the figure , and some orbits of ( [ eomonss ] ) are drawn . in this example , at the points a , b , c , d , the orbits appear , branch , merge , disappear , respectively .",
    "we can read off the information of topology from these processes .",
    "this is just the well - known idea of morse theory . in particular",
    ", we obtain the euler number of the @xmath3-space , by subtracting the total number of the branching and merging processes from the total number of the appearing and disappearing processes .",
    "now , we shall show that this analysis of topology in the world of functions has a counterpart in the world of matrices .",
    "the analogy of the matrix regularization to canonical quantization is useful here . in the latter",
    ", the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition determines the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian operator @xmath28 from the classical hamiltonian function @xmath29 defined on the phase space @xmath30 .",
    "namely , we draw classical orbits in @xmath30 space , that are parts of equal-@xmath31 lines , so that the areas of the domains between two adjacent orbits are equal to @xmath32",
    ". then eigenvalues of @xmath28 are given by the values of @xmath31 at these orbits .",
    "here , we shall exploit the analogy , which is summarized in ( [ analogytable ] ) , and state the analog of the bohr - sommerfeld condition .",
    "namely , we draw orbits of ( [ eomonss ] ) in the @xmath3-space so that the areas of the domains - space not in the target space .",
    "its physical meaning is the total @xmath8 contained in the domain , apart from a conventional factor , by the gauge choice made in the lightcone gauge formalism .",

    "since @xmath13 $ ] is the total area of the @xmath3-space , this simply means that we divide the @xmath3-space into @xmath2 parts of equal area .",
    "eigenvalues of @xmath33 are then given by the values of @xmath11 at these orbits .",
    "we assume this rule to hold .",
    "we shall justify the assumption in section [ smrcorr ] .    if we apply this rule to the case in fig .",
    "[ ftorus ] , then the eigenvalues of @xmath33 can be grouped into four subsets each of which corresponds to the family of the orbits belonging to ( i ) the region from the point a to the point b , ( ii ) the left branch of the torus from the point b to the point c , ( iii ) the right branch of the torus from the point b to the point c , ( iv ) the region from the point c to the point d , respectively .",
    "we call these subsets as eigenvalue sequences . for large enough n , eigenvalues belonging to each sequence have the following property .",
    "if we sort the eigenvalues contained in a sequence in increasing order of their values , and make a graph plotting the values of them versus their order , then the plotted points can be linearly approximated locally . to put it short , the eigenvalues in a sequence increase smoothly .",
    "it should be clear that , in general , if we do not group the eigenvalues properly , then the graph become zigzag - shaped and the above property is lost . in section [ smrcorr ]",
    ", we see that this linear approximation is essential in order the fundamental approximations ( [ appnrm])-([appbra ] ) to hold .",
    "the eigenvalue sequences should exhibit the same branching phenomenon as that of the orbits .",
    "for the example of fig .",
    "[ ftorus ] , the sequence ( i ) appears and then branches into the sequences ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "they merge into the sequence ( iv ) , and finally ( iv ) disappears .",
    "it is clear that all these considerations work the same in general cases other than that of fig .",
    "[ ftorus ] .",
    "thus , the information of membrane topology manifests itself in the branching phenomenon ( which consists of appearing , branching , merging , disappearing processes ) of eigenvalue sequences . a few examples , including the case similar to the situation in fig .",
    "[ ftorus ] , are given in section [ snumex ] .",
    "in this section , we present a new correspondence rule between matrices and functions , and then show that the fundamental approximations ( [ appnrm])-([appbra ] ) stem from the rule .",
    "we choose an arbitrary generic function @xmath11 and fix it as a reference , as in section [ stop ] .",
    "the rule is formulated in such a way that the representation of matrices is so chosen that the matrix @xmath33 , corresponding to the function @xmath11 , is diagonal . for simplicity of notation , we shall consider the case where only one eigenvalue sequence is present .",

    "the eigenvalue sequences , which we have introduced in this paper , are subsets of the all eigenvalues whose members can be linearly approximated locally . from the analog of the bohr - sommerfeld condition ,",
    "we have shown that the branching phenomenon reflects the information of topology .",
    "thus , we have clarified the manner the information of topology manifests itself in the eigenvalue distribution .",
    "it is natural to further ask the question : `` how completely can we read off the information of topology from given matrices ? '' .",
    "we shall give here some observations which are essential to this question .",
    "in the first place , our argument implies that there is no information of topology in such ill - behaved matrices for which the fundamental approximation formulae ( [ appnrm])-([appbra ] ) do not hold well .",
    "indeed , it is only for the case ( [ appnrm])-([appbra ] ) work , that the linear approximation ( [ qtzofarea ] ) should hold .",
    "hence , even the existence of the eigenvalue sequences is not guaranteed for those ill - behaved matrices .",
    "secondly , there occurs overlapping of topologies when we consider the interaction of membranes . for a typical example , let us consider process shown in fig .",
    "[ ftopologychangeconti ] . at first",
    "there are two spheres .",
    "then , these spheres approach each other and the distance @xmath135 ( in the target space ) between two spheres reduces to zero gradually , and finally the two spheres merge into a sphere .",
    "this overlapping is also present in the eigenvalue distribution .",
    "the process from the viewpoint of eigenvalue distribution is as follows . in fig .",
    "[ ftplcngevals ] the eigenvalue distribution of the matrix corresponding to the height in fig .",
    "[ ftopologychangeconti ] is shown .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution consists of two eigenvalue sequences .",
    "if the distance @xmath135 between the two eigenvalue sequences gradually reduces to zero , then we can not distinguish the eigenvalue distribution from that of a matrix corresponding to one sphere .",
    "it is interesting to treat topology changing processes of membranes by the matrix model in this way .",
    "our discussion in this paper has been of purely kinematical nature . to explore the dynamical implication of our rule",
    "is also clearly important .",
    "for example , our consideration has made clear the distinction between the configurations of matrices which approximate membranes well and which do not .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether and how the former configurations dominate in the path integral of the matrix model .",
    "we would like to comment on the issue of the membrane instability@xcite .",
    "let us consider a configuration of membranes which has a spike - like portion whose area is less than @xmath48 .",
    "if we simply apply the analog of the bohr - sommerfeld condition , we should fail to include the information of the spike into the matrices .",
    "stated more appropriately , our argument tells us that the configuration can not be well approximated by @xmath14 matrices .",
    "we want to stress that this spike has an essential difference to the spike which is considered in the membrane instability .",
    "one uses the word spike for a portion of a surface when its linear dimension is large , and at the same time its area is small .",
    "the difference between the spike in our context and the spike in the instability context lies in the meaning of the area . in the former",
    ", the area means area in the @xmath3-space , that is essentially @xmath8 . in the latter",
    ", the area means area in the target space , or the energy of the spike .",
    "this difference is meaningful . indeed , there are membranes which have portions that have small energy but large @xmath8 or vice versa",
    ". in particular , one can construct configurations of the matrix model which approximate well the membranes with spikes in the sense of the membrane instability .    as a direction of further investigation of the matrix regularization procedure itself , we recall the discussion at the end of section [ smrcorr ] . our rule in the present form",
    "does not include tunneling effects between sequences .",
    "although our rule gives correct overall behaviour of the matrix elements , we could not trust the rule in the present form to investigate the matrix elements in the immediate vicinity of the merging and branching processes . concrete examples of the processes are the points b , c in example 3 in section 5 .. the jump in the plot of the difference of eigenvalues is a natural consequence of our rule . ]",
    "it is an important task to extend our rule to incorporate the tunneling effects@xcite .",
    "one possible strategy would be to revisit the analog problem , namely the quantum mechanics of a particle in a double - well potential .",
    "we can construct a formula to relate the semi - classical wave functions in both wells , which is valid even for the energy level near the local maximum , extending the ordinary argument in the wkb approximation using airy functions .",
    "another interesting question is the uniqueness of the correspondence which gives the fundamental approximations .",
    "although we can not , at present , provide the proof , we suspect that the correspondence rule from which ( [ appnrm])-([appbra ] ) can be derived is unique up to similarity transformation .",
    "indeed , examples studied in section 5 suggest that the previously known rules and our new rule are the same up to similarity transformation . an immediate consequence of the uniqueness is that a change of the reference function should amount to a similarity transformation .",
    "it is believed that the matrix regularization can be extended for general even dimensional base spaces on which the lie brackets can be defined .",
    "the correspondence rule between matrices and functions can be easily constructed by using tensor product of matrices , when the topology of the base space are given by direct product of some two dimensional spaces .",
    "these extensions are important in the matrix model of m - theory , in order to incorporate longitudinal 5-branes .",
    "to extend our analysis to study topological properties of these higher dimensional objects is also an interesting problem .",
    "we believe that the analysis analogous to the wkb approximation , used throughout in this paper , will also be useful for the higher dimensional case .",
    "however , it would be a challenging task , since the wkb approximation itself is not fully understood for generic non - integrable hamiltonian systems on four or more dimensional phase spaces , compared to that for the necessarily integrable systems on two dimensional phase spaces considered in this paper .",
    "we conclude with three possible applications of the new correspondence rule .",
    "\\(1 ) one can construct various interesting configurations of the matrix model by our rule .",
    "a particular merit of our rule in this respect is that it can be applied to a membrane which has genus higher than two , with no more difficulty than to a membrane having topology of a sphere or a torus .",
    "\\(2 ) our rule may be useful when investigating the lorentz symmetry of the matrix model .",
    "it has been tried to regularize the lorentz generators of the continuum theory in order to construct those of the matrix model @xcite . however , since some of the lorentz generators are not built up by simple multiplications or integrations or lie brackets , one has been inclined to use the basis expansion of the previously known correspondence rules .",
    "since there are many different expansions for different topologies , it has been difficult to define the lorentz generators in a unique way . since our rule can be applied uniformly to all topologies , it is a promising tool in constructing definitions of the lorentz generators of the matrix model in a unique way .",
    "\\(3 ) the geometrical interpretation of matrix elements in our rule may make the problem of the large @xmath2 limit of the matrix model accessible .",
    "the problem can be interpreted as a renormalization of the membrane theory .",
    "we hope that our rule , by determining the short - distance ( or rather , the small - area ) degrees of freedom , enables us to construct a block - spin transformation of the matrix model .",
