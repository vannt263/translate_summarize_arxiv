    "particle - based simulation techniques have recently become an attractive alternative to more traditional methods for the coarse - grained modeling of a fluctuating solvent .",
    "a particularly appealing algorithm , introduced by malevanets and kapral @xcite , and later called multi - particle collision dynamics @xcite or stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) @xcite provides a `` hydrodynamic heat bath , '' the details of which are not resolved , but which provides the correct hydrodynamic interactions and thermal fluctuations .",
    "the coarse - grained dynamics ignores molecular details , but enables simulations which span much longer time scales than can be addressed using molecular dynamics techniques .",
    "it has been used to study the behavior of polymers @xcite , colloids @xcite ( including sedimentation @xcite ) , vesicles in shear flow @xcite , and complex fluids @xcite .",
    "in addition to srd s numerical advantages , its simplicity has made it possible to obtain analytic expressions for the transport coefficients which are valid for both large and small mean free paths , something which is very difficult to do for other mesoscale particle - based algorithms .    in its original form @xcite ,",
    "the srd algorithm was not galilean invariant at low temperatures , where the mean free path , @xmath0 , is smaller than the cell size @xmath1 .",
    "however , galilean invariance can be restored by introducing a random shift @xcite of the computational grid before every multi - particle interaction .",
    "in addition to restoring galilean invariance , this grid shifting procedure accelerates momentum transfer between cells and leads to a collisional contribution to the transport coefficients .",
    "two approaches have been used to analyze the resulting algorithm and determine the shear viscosity and thermal diffusivity . in refs . @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a non - equilibrium kinetic approach is used to derive the transport coefficients . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a discrete - time projection operator technique was utilized to obtain green - kubo relations @xcite for the model s transport coefficients , and explicit expressions for the transport coefficients were derived in accompanying papers @xcite .",
    "the two approaches are complementary and , for the most part , agree in their conclusions .",
    "the first is rather straightforward and intuitively appealing , but makes several assumptions which are not easily verified .",
    "the current approach justifies in detail several assumptions used in the non - equilibrium calculations of refs . @xcite and @xcite ; it can also be used to analyze the transport coefficients of the longitudinal modes , namely the bulk viscosity and thermal diffusivity , which are hard to calculate analytically in the non - equilibrium approach @xcite .",
    "note , in particular , that the collisional contribution to the thermal conductivity has not yet been determined using the non - equilibrium methods .    in this paper",
    ", we show in detail how the time series in the green - kubo relations for the transport coefficients can be resummed in such a way as to eliminate all dependence on the space - fixed cell coordinates of the particles @xcite .",
    "this leads to a dramatic simplification of the sums , and enables an exact evaluation of the collisional contribution to the transport coefficients .",
    "it is also shown that there are only pure kinetic and collision contributions to the transport coefficients , as was implicitly assumed in the calculations of refs .",
    "explicit expressions for the collisional contributions to the viscosities and the thermal diffusivity are given , and the consequences of the fact that the collisional contribution to the microscopic stress tensor is _ not _ symmetric are discussed in detail . in particular , it is shown that this lack of symmetry leads to a slight change in the longitudinal viscous transport coefficient .",
    "the hydrodynamic modes are , however , not affected , and it does not impact on the applicability and stability of the method , even at low temperature .",
    "in the srd algorithm , the fluid is modeled by particles with continuous spatial coordinates @xmath2 and velocities @xmath3 .",
    "the system is coarse - grained into the cells of a regular lattice with no restriction on the number of particles in a cell .",
    "the evolution of the system consists of two steps : streaming and collision . in the streaming step",
    ", the coordinate of each particle is incremented by its displacement during the time step , @xmath4 .",
    "collisions are modeled by a simultaneous stochastic rotation of the relative velocities of _ every _ particle in each cell . as discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite , a random shift of the particle coordinates before the collision step is required to ensure galilean invariance .",
    "all particles are shifted by the _",
    "same _ random vector with components in the interval @xmath5 $ ] before the collision step .",
    "particles are then shifted back to their original positions after the collision .",
    "if we denote the cell coordinate of the shifted particle @xmath6 by @xmath7 , the algorithm is summarized in the equations @xmath8+\\bomega[\\bxi_i^s(t+\\tau ) ] \\cdot\\{{\\bf v}_i(t)-{\\bf u}[\\bxi_i^s(t+\\tau)]\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 denotes a stochastic rotation matrix , and @xmath10 is the mean velocity of the particles in cell @xmath11 .",
    "all particles in the cell are subject to the same rotation , but the rotations in different cells are statistically independent . there is a great deal of freedom in how the rotation step is implemented , and any stochastic rotation matrix consistent with detailed balance can be used . in two dimensions , the stochastic rotation matrix , @xmath12 ,",
    "is typically taken to be a rotation by an angle @xmath13 , with probability @xmath14 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in three dimensions ,",
    "two collision rules have been considered . in the first , ( model a in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one performs rotations by an angle @xmath15 about a randomly chosen direction , where all orientations of the random axis occur with equal probability . in the second , ( model b in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , rotations are performed about one of three orthogonal rotation axes , i.e. @xmath16- , @xmath17- and @xmath18-axes of a cartesian coordinate system . at each collision",
    "step one of these three axes is chosen at random , and a rotation by an angle @xmath13 is then performed , where the sign is chosen at random .",
    "because of the cell structure introduced to define coarse - grained collisions , angular momentum is not conserved in a collision @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the macroscopic viscous stress tensor is not , in general , a symmetric function of the derivatives @xmath19 .",
    "its general form can be determined as follows . both the macroscopic viscous stress tensor , @xmath20 , and the velocity gradient tensor , @xmath21 which appear in the navier - stokes equation are rank two tensors .",
    "if the velocity gradients are small , we can assume  as is generally done  that the momentum transfer due to viscosity depends only on the first derivatives of the velocity , so that @xmath22 symmetry arguments can be used to reduce the number of independent elements in the compliance tensor @xmath23 .",
    "because of the simple cubic grid structure used in the algorithm , we have at least cubic symmetry . in this case",
    ", it can be shown @xcite that the most general form for @xmath23 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rank four unit tensor @xcite , @xmath1 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are viscosity coefficients , and @xmath29 is the mass density of the fluid .",
    "it follows that @xmath30 with kinematic shear viscosities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and bulk viscosity @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the spatial dimension .",
    "@xmath35 is the viscous transport coefficient associated with the non - symmetric part of the stress tensor , and @xmath28 is a viscosity coefficient related to a possible lack of full rotational symmetry ; both @xmath35 and @xmath28 are usually zero in simple fluids . if we define a new tensor from the diagonal elements of @xmath21 , namely @xmath36 , the resulting form of the momentum equation for a fluid reads @xmath37 & = & -\\nabla p + \\nabla \\cdot \\tensor{\\hat \\sigma } \\\\ & = & -\\nabla p + \\rho ( \\nu_1 + \\nu_2 ) \\delta{\\bf v } + \\rho \\left ( ( 1-\\frac{2}{d } ) \\nu_1 -   \\nu_2 + \\gamma \\right )   \\nabla ( \\nabla\\cdot{\\bf v } ) + \\epsilon \\nabla \\cdot \\tensor{r}\\;\\ ; , \\label{shear1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the pressure .",
