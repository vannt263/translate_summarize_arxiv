    "we differ local from global methods , whether they focus on the previous limit sets related to the two branches .    after some introductory theory culminating into the presentation of what the invariant sets @xmath23 , said ` _ _ hedgehogs _ _ ' , are meant in holomorphic dynamics , we will illustrate the related problem by showing how most available techniques fail to display @xmath23 adequately ; finally , we will discuss how to solve this question and to code an approach via pseudo - c@xmath24 language code .",
    "we are going to sketch out the mathematical terms of our local environment : here complex dynamics are mostly interested in the orbits behavior induced by iterates @xmath25 near limit cycles of the map @xmath8 and focuses on cycles of order 1 , i.e. fixed points @xmath26 .",

    "one understand that the indifferent case stands at the middle way and it is the conjunction point among those ones , either in a _ inclusive _ way by presenting subcases where all dynamical features are shown at the same time and in an _ exclusive _ way , i.e. showing features which are not enjoyed by both extremal cases .",
    "in fact ( super)attracting fixed points can be reached by forward iterates , whereas julia sets include cycles of repelling points and reached by backward iterates . obviously , the dynamical characters ( contraction , repulsion ) of entries [ fixedpointsuper ] ) , [ fixedpointattracting ] ) and [ fixedpointrepelling ] ) hold for the direct function @xmath39 , while they are inverted for @xmath40 .",

    "the main separation , into the two great classes of @xmath42 ( rationally indifferent @xmath11 , _ parabolic _ case ) and of @xmath43 ( irrationally indifferent @xmath11 , _ elliptic _ case ) , is followed by a number of sub - cases .",
    "the former relates to one only invariant set , namely the fatou - leau flower ( see def . at p. ) , and does not branch out ; while @xmath43 generates a richer variety whose local dynamics get far more complicate : here a second level opens to local invariant sets , distinguishing for the numerical properties of @xmath44 , some of which are extremely weak and shunning the machine finite digits computation .",
