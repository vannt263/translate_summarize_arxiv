    "solid - electrolyte interphase ( sei ) films that passivate low voltage anode surfaces are critical for lithium ion battery operations.@xcite these films arise from electrochemical reduction and subsequent breakdown of the organic solvent - based electrolyte and additive molecules , which are unstable under battery charging potentials .",
    "the sei blocks further electron transfer from the anode to the electrolyte , yet permits lithium ion ( li@xmath2 ) transport .",
    "sei films on traditional graphite anodes are not static , but grow thicker during cycling .",
    "moreover , they are known to evolve either by dissolution or chemical processes.@xcite silicon , a potential next - generation anode material,@xcite can expand by 300% upon full lithiation , and the sei films coating its surfaces@xcite are likely to crack , delaminate,@xcite and in general exhibit more dynamic evolution than on graphite surfaces .",
    "lithium metal,@xcite much more reactive than graphite , is also being considered as transportation battery anode material .",
    "hence there is an urgent need for further understanding of sei evolution and stability on these reactive anode surfaces .    in terms of sei stability ,",
    "sei dissolution in liquid electrolytes has been discussed,@xcite as has the chemical instability of sei components due to elevated temperature,@xcite the presence of acid,@xcite and reactions with transition metal incorporated into the sei.@xcite a recent pioneering computational work that emphasizes the concept of sei stability has predicted that organic sei components can react with li@xmath3si surfaces , as well as undergo attacks by radicals present in the electrolyte.@xcite these interfacial reactions between sei components and active materials help determine the chemistry at electrode / sei interfaces .",
    "understanding such reactions is crucial for generating detailed models of sei structures that govern their electron - blocking and li@xmath2 transmitting functions .",
    "the present work systematically addresses the stability of multilayer organic and inorganic sei components on li metal and li@xmath3si surfaces .",
    "this work is motivated by solid - solid interface modeling conducted in the context of lithium ion battery solid electrolytes,@xcite and assumes a time lapse between the first deposition of sei products and their destruction .",
    "thus it is complementary to the liquid - solid interface approach@xcite more pertinent to the initial stages of sei growth .",
    "first we distinguish three possible criteria of sei stability : thermodynamic , electrochemical , and interfacial .",
    "( 1 ) following ref .  , we define `` thermodynamic instability '' to mean that the bulk sei material ( assuming it can be synthesized in bulk quantity ) can be decomposed into one or more solid or gas phases with lower overall free energy .",
    "this criterion allows breaking any chemical bond and is agnostic about reaction kinetics .",
    "( 2 ) `` electrochemical instability '' is taken to mean that the phase can be readily electrochemically oxidized or reduced during cyclic voltametry.@xcite only the cleavage of covalent or ionic bonds that can break in the time scale of electron transfer is permitted , although further work is needed to refine the precise meaning of the kinetic constraint .",
    "electrochemical stability is related to band - alignment diagrams frequently invoked in the battery literature,@xcite where redox reaction are assumed to begin when the fermi levels in the metallic electrode coincide with the valence or conduction band edges of the electrolyte . however , organic electrolytes , sei components such as li@xmath0co@xmath1 , and many cathode oxide materials form localized charge states ( `` states in the gap '' ) , or small polarons , upon being reduced or oxidized . thus redox potentials , not band edge positions , are the rigorous governing quantities .",
    "note that some authors describe this instability criterion as `` thermodynamic''@xcite rather than `` electrochemical '' ( this work , ref .  , and others ) .",
    "( 3 ) `` interfacial instability '' here means that exothermic reactions can occur at the interface within typical lithium ion battery charge / discharge time scales . when a sei component is thermodynamically unstable but electrochemically stable",
    " thus preventing long - range electron transfer ",
    "interfacial reactions represent one key way to trigger the intrinsic thermodynamic instability . in this work",
    ", we impose a one - hour reaction time threshold ; short reaction times are considered to yield interfacially unstability .",
    "this work focuses on two dominant sei components , namely inorganic lithium carbonate ( li@xmath0co@xmath1 ) and organic lithium ethylene dicarbonate ( ledc ) .",
    "both components are widely reported to be significant components of the anode sei when the liquid electrolyte contains ethylene carbonate ( ec ) and other linear carbonates.@xcite crystalline li(100 ) and amorphous silicon ( a - si ) surfaces are used to represent two extremes of reactive anode surfaces on which the sei may decompose .",
    "we stress that the a - si / sei interface is intended to represent sei - covered si anode surface after cycling , not pristine si surfaces which should be covered with native oxides.@xcite the sei / li(100 ) interface is relevant to undersirable li - plating on graphite anodes@xcite and intentional li - deposition when li metal is used as anode.@xcite li(100 ) may also be a reasonable proxy for high @xmath4 li@xmath3si surfaces because in previous modeling studies,@xcite the low energy surfaces of high-@xmath4 li@xmath3si are found to be dominated by li atoms .",
    "si outcroppings on li(100 ) are considered for its effect on sei reactivity in the supporting information document ( s.i . ) .",
    "it has generally been accepted that anode sei consists of an inner inorganic layer ( e.g. , li@xmath0co@xmath1 , li@xmath0o , and/or lif ) and an outer organic layer ( e.g. , ledc and polymeric species).@xcite however , the ledc / li(100 ) interface is relevant for reasons not just related to inadvertant li - plating on the outer sei surface.@xcite a recent ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) study has shown that ledc can form from a sub - monolayer of ec molecules on li metal surfaces at low temperature.@xcite this finding is in agreement with a modeling work suggesting that ledc may be formed by two - electron reduction of ec during the initial stages of sei formation,@xcite not ( only ) at late stages via one - electron reduction . hence the reactions of ledc on active material surfaces , presumably to produce inorganic species , are also relevant to the anode / sei interface .",
    "the voltage dependences of these processes will be discussed . by `` voltage '' we refer to the electronic potential,@xcite which depends on the fermi level and reflects the instantaneous applied potential .",
    "this definition is consistent with computational studies in many electrochemical applications.@xcite in contrast , the lithium chemical potential , which is a function of the li - content , is a slow - responding property that indicates whether the interfacial structure is out - of - equilibrium or not ; at interfaces it does not by itself determine the instantaneous voltage.@xcite    _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) simulations are also conducted to show that decomposition reactions of organic sei components similar to edc can readily occur in less well - controlled , liquid - solid interface environments , with multiple species decorating the surfaces of li@xmath3si crystalline anode with finite li - content  instead of just li(100 ) or si - doped li - metal surfaces .",
    "these simulations examine the decomposition of lithium vinylene dicarbonate ( li@xmath0vdc ) during the initial stages of sei formation , when liquid electrolyte , lif clusters , and submonolayer li@xmath0vdc are all present .",
    "vdc differs from edc only by a carbon - carbon double bond and two less protons .",
    "it can be formed in the presence of vinylene carbonate , a well - known electrolyte additive .",
    "the lif cluster represents another surface `` defect '' on otherwise crystalline li@xmath3si .",
    "the aimd predictions in these systems complement and broadly agree with our static , solid - interface results .",
    "the reactions of li@xmath3si with the other sei component considered herein , li@xmath0co@xmath1 , are more challenging due to the need for lattice matching between crystalline li@xmath0co@xmath1 and the large li@xmath3si surface unit cells.@xcite such studies will be conducted in the future .",

    "we apply periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) dft methods to assess thermodynamic stability and interfacial stability , and cluster - based ( cb ) dft calculations to examine electrochemical stability .",
    "an sei component is defined to be thermodynamically unstable if energy is gained by transforming it into other phases upon reaction with li metal ; to exhibit interfacial instability on a particular anode material surface if it reacts exothermically within one hour ; and to exhibit electrochemical instability if cb - dft predicts a reduction potential which is positive relative to the li@xmath2/li(s ) reference . if an sei component reacts on an anode surface and transforms into a new stable phase or film which passivates the anode , the original sei component is still regarded as unstable at the interface .",

    "it can be argued that the inclusion of liquid electrolytes will reduce this value to approximately 0  v vs.  li@xmath2/li(s ) ( in chemical equilibrium with the li metal slab ) due to preferential interfacial dipole moment alignment of organic solvent molecules.@xcite since liquid electrolyte is not considered in this section , we explore the effect of voltage variations by adding two li interstitials between the outermost layers of li@xmath0co@xmath1 ( fig .",

    "the reason is that the electric field generated by the two li@xmath2 interstitials is weak ( @xmath47  v/@xmath48   ) .",
    "this calculation suggests that , if the outer surface is occupied by a high - dielectric liquid with counter - ions , so that it is the electrolyte rather than interstitual li@xmath2 that lowers the electronic voltage from 0.88  v to about 0  v , the effect on li@xmath0co@xmath1 degradation at the solid - solid interface will still be small  just because of the thickness of the carbonate layer dictates a weak electric field .",

    "another possibility is that li@xmath2 interstitials or vacancies right at the interface lead to a narrow edl and a much larger local electric field just outside the active electrode material ( fig .",

    "suggests that oc@xmath0h@xmath19o@xmath40 rapidly reacts with intact solvent molecules to form oligomers that can subsequently yield li@xmath0co@xmath1 and ledc .",
    "since the latter components are not stable on li metal surfaces , oc@xmath0h@xmath19o@xmath40 may eventually be destroyed in multistep reactions .",

    "note that other sei components like li@xmath0vdc may still decompose on the outside of the li@xmath0o layer.@xcite    if the anode is li@xmath3si , the situation is more complex .",

    "li@xmath0o has been found in the sei region immediately next to li@xmath3si in silicon anodes , although this has been attributed to the transformation of sio@xmath0.@xcite this li@xmath0o slowly transforms into lif , indicating that even the deepest - lying sei layer can undergo evolution as cycling proceeds.@xcite since we have not considered f - containing compounds in our static dft work , the competition between lif and li@xmath0o in the innermost sei layer will the subject of future studies .",

    "it is possible that organic components may coat on the electrode surface after first nucleating in the liquid electrolyte region,@xcite and then transform into inorganic components like li@xmath0o . in light of this work ,",
    "it is of interest to re - examine the stability of newly discovered sei components.@xcite    we stress that most calculations in this work are either static or short aimd trajectories .",
    "our simulation conditions can only be related to dynamical measurements qualitatively .",
    "for example , the charging or `` c''-rate can not be quantified .",
    "however , quasi - static overpotential voltage conditions can be represented by creating mismatches between the electronic voltage ( related to fermi levels ) and ionic voltage ( related to lithium content).@xcite in anode materials like si or sn , sei thickness and chemical composition ( e.g. , organic vs.  inorganic ) can change during charge / discharge ; the passivating film can even crack , exposing pristine anode materials , and needs to be reformed from scratch ( i.e. , the surfaces are at `` zero sei thickness '' ) .",
    "dft - based data will be crucial to parameterize multiscale models to address these issues .",
    "finally , in terms of modeling , this work highlights the challenges facing systematic treatment of buried solid - solid interfaces.@xcite imaging techniques have yet to achieve the resolution needed to elucidate the atomic details that can be used as starting points for modeling such interfaces .",
    "therefore a suite of surface models ranging from pristine to defect - incorporated are considered .",
    "other factors to be considered in the future include strain induced by inserting / removal li during charge / discharge . the low bulk modulus li metal and high `` x '' li@xmath3si materials considered in this work are not expected to have their electronic properties or reactivities strongly affected by strain , but amorphous si may .",
    "chemical / spatial heterogeneities , facet dependence , and mechanical deformation also need to be addressed .",
    "systematization of interfacial modeling will likely emerge after more modeling studies of individual sets of interfaces have highlighted the commonalities and differences .",
    "in this work , we consider three criteria of sei stability : thermodynamic , electrochemical , and interfacial . two key sei components , lithium carbonate ( li@xmath0co@xmath1 ) and lithium ethylene dicarbonate ( ledc ) , are predicted to be electrochemically stable but thermodynamically unstable .",
    "the fundamental reason for thermodynamic instability is likely the existence of carbon atoms in high formal charge states under highly electrochemically reductive conditions . by this definition ,",
    "we conjecture that most carbon - containing sei components may actually be thermodynamically unstable .",
    "interfacial reactions can trigger the decomposition of these sei products .",
    "our static dft calculations focus on the interfaces between these sei components and two model surfaces .",
    "li(100 ) and a - si are chosen to represent two extremes of reactive anode .",
    "ledc proves to be fragile , decomposing on li(100 ) with reaction barriers predicted to be significantly lower than 0.92  ev .",
    "this suggests that decomposition will occur within battery operation ( i.e. , about one - hour ) timescales .",
    "ledc decomposition on a - si surfaces is predicted to be slower than the 1-hour threshold time frame .",
    "li@xmath0co@xmath1 decomposition is observed on li metal surfaces .",
    "the reaction barrier is below the 0.92  ev threshold in the presence of excess li atoms at the interface .",
    "therefore we predict that a thin layer of li@xmath0o , of at present unknown thickness , exists on lithium metal surfaces below the rest of the sei components , unless li@xmath0o is subsequently converted into lif .",
    "similar li@xmath0co@xmath1 degradation reactions and li@xmath0o formation are speculated to occur on high li - content li@xmath3si surfaces .",
    "dft - based molecular dynamics simulations are also used to demonstrate that organic sei components spontaneously decomposes on explicit li@xmath3si surfaces .",
