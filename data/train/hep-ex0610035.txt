    "the putative @xmath1(5s ) resonance was discovered at cesr long ago by the cleo  @xcite and cusb  @xcite collaborations by observing an enhancement in the total @xmath17 annihilation cross - section into hadrons at a center - of - mass energy of about 40 mev above the @xmath18 production threshold .",
    "its mass and its production cross - section were measured as ( 10.865@xmath190.008 )  gev/@xmath20 and about 0.35  nb , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the possible final states of the @xmath1(5s ) resonance decays are : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where the @xmath14 and @xmath31 mesons can be either neutral or charged .",
    "several models involving coupled channel calculations have predicted the cross - section and final state composition @xcite .",
    "the unitarized quark model @xcite , for example , predicts that the total @xmath32 cross - section at the @xmath1(5s ) energy is dominated by @xmath24 and @xmath33 production , with @xmath0 production accounting for about 1/3 of the total rate .",
    "the original @xmath34116 pb@xmath4 of data collected at cesr did not reveal if any @xmath0 mesons were produced . by measuring the inclusive @xmath11 production rate using cleo iii data we previously measured the fraction of @xmath0 meson production at the @xmath1(5s ) , @xmath2 , to be @xmath35 of the total @xmath36 rate  @xcite",
    "; this measurement uses a theoretical estimate of @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 production was confirmed in a second cleo analysis  @xcite that fully reconstructed @xmath0 meson decays .",
    "in addition , this analysis showed that the final states are dominated by the @xmath38 decay channel .",
    "these results have been confirmed by the belle collaboration  @xcite .",
    "a third cleo analysis of the exclusive @xmath14 reconstruction at the @xmath1(5s ) showed that the @xmath39 final states in @xmath1(5s ) decays are dominated by @xmath24 with a considerable contribution from @xmath25 and @xmath40 final states  @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath0 production rate at the @xmath1(5s ) resonance , @xmath2 , is necessary to compare with predictions of theoretical models of @xmath41-hadron production .",
    "more importantly , @xmath2 is also essential for evaluating the possibility of @xmath0 studies at the @xmath1(5s ) using current @xmath14-factories , and for future @xmath42 super-@xmath14 factories , should they come to fruition , where precision measurements of @xmath0 decays are an important goal @xcite .",
    "however , the determination of @xmath2 in a model independent manner requires several tens of fb@xmath4  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we improve our knowledge of the @xmath0 production at the @xmath1(5s ) by using inclusive @xmath8 meson yields to make a second model dependent measurement of @xmath43 .",
    "we choose to examine @xmath8 meson yields because they will be produced much more often in @xmath0 decays than in @xmath14 decays .",
    "the branching fractions of @xmath0 to @xmath11 mesons and @xmath14 to @xmath44 mesons are of order 1 , while the rates of @xmath0 to @xmath44 mesons and @xmath14 to @xmath11 mesons are on the order of 1/10 .",
    "we also know that the production rate of @xmath8 mesons is one order of magnitude higher in @xmath11 decays than in @xmath45 and @xmath46 decays as measured using recent cleo - c data  @xcite .",
    "these results are shown in table  [ tab : dinc ] .",
    "the rate of @xmath44 mesons into @xmath8 mesons is only 1% , while the rate of @xmath11 mesons into @xmath8 mesons is 16% .    .@xmath45 ,",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 inclusive branching ratios into @xmath8 mesons .",
    "the @xmath44 meson decays used 281 pb@xmath4 of data at the @xmath48 , while the @xmath11 decays were measured using 195 pb@xmath4 at or near 4170 mev . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we measure the momentum spectra of @xmath8 mesons from @xmath1(4s ) and @xmath1(5s ) decays , and use these data to estimate the ratio @xmath2 of @xmath49 to the total @xmath36 quark pair production at the @xmath1(5s ) energy as @xmath50 .",
    "we also update our previous measurement of @xmath2 using @xmath11 yields @xcite , and we find @xmath51 . the central value and the error slightly change due to a better determination of the relative luminosity .",
    "furthermore , using our cross - section measurement of @xmath52 nb for hadron production above 4-flavor continuum at the @xmath1(5s ) energy , we measure total @xmath14 meson production and extract @xmath53)% . taking a weighted average of all three methods",
    "gives @xmath16% , where common systematic errors have been accounted for .",
