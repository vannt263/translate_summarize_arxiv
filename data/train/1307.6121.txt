    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors gives another opportunity to study the physics of high - temperature superconductivity besides the cuprates.@xcite the parent compounds of iron - based superconductors are antiferromagnetic semimetals , and superconductivity can be induced by hole , electron doping or applying pressure .",
    "for example , superconductivity was induced in bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 by the doping of co , ni , and cu.@xcite in the case of co and ni doping , the doped electron numbers predicted by rigid band model are @xmath5 and 2@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the study on phase diagram of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4 and ba(fe@xmath0ni@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4 by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) indicates that the doped electron number roughly follows the rigid - band model.@xcite therefore , it is natural to expect that superconductivity could be induced by cu doping and the doped electron number is 3@xmath5 .",
    "however , superconductivity was observed in a very narrow range of doping in ba(fe@xmath0cu@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4,@xcite and no superconductivity was observed in sr(fe@xmath0cu@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4.@xcite    although the doping effect of co and ni is clear now , the role of cu doping is still under debate .",
    "x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) and x - ray absorption ( xas ) measurements show that cu 3@xmath6 states locate at the bottom of the valence band in a localized 3@xmath7 shell , so that the formal valence state of cu is @xmath8 and the substitution of fe@xmath9 by cu@xmath10 results in hole doping.@xcite the theoretical and experimental studies on srcu@xmath4as@xmath4 , the end member of sr(fe@xmath0cu@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4 series , indicate that it is an @xmath11-band metal with hole - type carries dominate and cu in the nonmagnetic 3@xmath7 electronic configuration corresponds to the valence state cu@xmath10,@xcite which further supports the result of xps and xas .",
    "in addition , the doping effect of cu is similar to that of mn , which is also considered as hole doping and no superconductivity has been found.@xcite on the other hand , electron doping by cu was proved by arpes,@xcite and further confirmed by hall measurement on ba@xmath12k@xmath13(fe@xmath0cu@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4.@xcite similar superconducting dome to that of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4 was observed in the phase diagram of ba(fe@xmath14co@xmath1cu@xmath15)@xmath4as@xmath4 ( x @xmath16 0.022 and x @xmath16 0.047),@xcite indicating the similar doping effect between co and cu , and suggesting electron doping induced by cu substitution . to reconcile this controversial situation ,",
    "it is of great interest to further investigate the cu doping effect in other family of iron - pnictide superconductors .    besides bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 ,",
    "high quality of nafeas single crystal is also available now , which turns out to be suitable for studying the cu doping effect .",
    "nafeas is regarded as a filamentary superconductor , and the superconductivity can not be detected by specific heat . by substituting co or ni on fe sites , bulk superconductivity was obtained.@xcite the ni doping doubles the amount of electron doping of co,@xcite which follows the rigid band model .",
    "moreover , it has been reported that @xmath2 of analogous compound life@xmath0cu@xmath1as is suppressed linearly by cu doping.@xcite hence , we study the role of cu doping in nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as , and compare it with the effect of cu doping in bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 and lifeas . in this paper , we report the study on the physical properties and phase diagram of nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as by measuring x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , hall coefficient , specific heat , and high pressure .",
    "a phase diagram similar to nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as is established .",
    "the comparison of the physical properties and phase diagrams between nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as and nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as clearly indicates that cu doping is electron doping and the electron concentration deviates from the expected 3@xmath5 .",
    "the deviation can be explained that part of the doped electrons fill the impurity band which is located deep below the fermi level ( @xmath17 ) and do not fill the energy bands as predicted by the rigid - band model.@xcite",
    "a series of nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as single crystals was grown by adopting the naas flux method .",

    "as also suggested by high pressure measurement , the impurity effect of cu is stronger than co. the dome of superconductivity is mainly controlled by the balance of carrier concentration and impurity scattering induced by the dopants .",
    "so the narrow or even absence of superconducting dome in the phase diagram of cu doped bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 arises from that enough carriers are doped and so many impurities are induced .",
    "therefore , the expanded superconducting dome of ba(fe@xmath14co@xmath1cu@xmath15)@xmath4as@xmath4 ( @xmath5 @xmath16 0.022 and 0.047 ) than ba(fe@xmath0cu@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4 can be understood that fewer carriers are needed when bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 have been electron doped with co. while in nafeas , whose structural / sdw transition temperature is much lower than bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 , fewer electrons are required to suppress sdw and induce superconductivity . therefore , cu doping can provide enough carriers to map out a phase diagram similar to nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as and ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "meanwhile , as the cu concentration further increases , density of states ( dos ) at @xmath17 is gradually removed by the impurity band induced by cu doping . as a result ,",
    "metal - insulator transition is observed as a function of doping .",
    "this scenario can also explain the contradiction between results of xps / xas and arpes . since cu 3@xmath6 states are located deeper below the @xmath17 than co,@xcite the extra @xmath6 electrons for cu almost totally locate around the substituted site .",
    "hence , closed 3@xmath6 shell is observed by xps and xas , although there is a little delocated electron introduced by cu dopant .",
    "it is found that substitutions of cu for fe in ( ba , sr)fe@xmath4as@xmath4 at low level result in electron doping , while in srcu@xmath4as@xmath4 , the end member of sr(fe@xmath0cu@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4 , is an @xmath11-band metal with hole - type carries dominate.@xcite the contradictory result has been interpreted that there is a crossover between electron and hole doping with increasing @xmath5 , which is induced by tetragonal ( t ) to collapsed tetragonal ( ct ) phase transition as a function of doping.@xcite thus , in the case of nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as , where no ct phase has been observed , it is natural to observe electron doping at low - level substitution of cu for fe .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed structural , transport , thermodynamic , and high pressure measurements on nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as single crystals .",
    "enough carries can be provided by cu doping to map out a phase diagram similar to nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as . in underdoped region ,",
    "both the structural and sdw transition are monotonically suppressed by cu doping . @xmath2 and",
    "the superconducting shielding fraction are enhanced with the doping .",
    "bulk superconductivity with @xmath2 = 11.5 k is observed at optimally doped sample , and a metal - insulator transition is observed with further doping . finally , insulating instead of metallic behavior in nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as is observed in extremely overdoped non - superconducting samples .",
    "@xmath2 is obviously enhanced by pressure , but the @xmath3 decreases with cu concentration .",
    "the hall measurements and comparison between cu and co doped nafeas phase diagrams indicate that cu doping introduces electron into system , but the number of electron is far from 3@xmath5 as predicted by rigid - band model .",
