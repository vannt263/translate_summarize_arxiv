    "recent years have witnessed remarkable qualitative and quantitative progress in the understanding of the casimir effect @xcite both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "measurements of the casimir force have reached a precision level of 1% @xcite .",
    "further improvements are currently aimed at with intense efforts , owing to the increasing relevance of these quantum forces for nano- and micro - scale mechanical systems . also from the perspective of fundamental physics , casimir precision measurements play a major role in the search for new sub - millimeter forces , resulting in important constraints for new physics @xcite .    on this level of precision , corrections owing to surface roughness , finite conductivity , thermal fluctuations and geometry dependencies have to be accounted for @xcite .",
    "these corrections may be classified in terms of material corrections on the one hand ; they are induced , for instance , by surface roughness and finite conductivity which may be viewed as a deviation from the ideal casimir configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "corrections due to geometry dependence are of direct quantum origin and thus universal , i.e. , independent of the microscopic details of the interactions between the fluctuating field and the constituents of the surfaces . since material corrections are difficult to control with high precision , force measurements at larger surface separations up to the micron range are intended . though this implies stronger geometry dependence , this universal effect is , in principle , under clean theoretical control , since it follows directly from quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "straightforward computations of geometry dependencies have long been conceptually complicated , since the relevant information is subtly encoded in the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "generically , analytic solutions are restricted to highly symmetric geometries .",
    "this problem is particularly prominent , since current and future precision measurements predominantly rely on configurations involving curved surfaces , such as a sphere above a plate .",
    "curved configurations help to circumvent the difficulty of maintaining parallelism as it occurs in the parallel - plate configuration ; the latter has been mastered so far only in one experiment @xcite with a precision level of @xmath1 . as a general recipe for curved configurations , the proximity force approximation ( pfa",
    ") @xcite has been the standard , though uncontrolled , tool for estimating curvature effects for non - planar geometries in all experiments so far .    in recent years",
    ", various new techniques have been developed for computing casimir effects in more involved geometries @xcite , each with its own merits and limitations .",
    "this includes improved approximation techniques which can deal with curved geometries more reliably , such as the semiclassical approximation @xcite and the optical approximation @xcite , as well as exact field theoretic methods based on functional - integral techniques @xcite or scattering theory @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we use and further develop _ worldline numerics _",
    "@xcite , which facilitates casimir computations from field - theoretic first principles .",
    "worldline numerics builds on a combination of the string - inspired approach to quantum field theory @xcite with monte carlo methods . as a main advantage",
    ", the worldline algorithm can be formulated for arbitrary geometries , resulting in a numerical estimate of the exact answer @xcite .",
    "the inherent use of feynman path - integral techniques circumvents the problem of determining the casimir fluctuation spectrum @xcite , which is often encountered in other approaches .",
    "the resulting algorithms are trivially scalable and computational efforts increases only linearly with the parameters of the numerics .    here , we present worldline algorithms to examine the casimir effect in a sphere - plate and cylinder - plate geometry for a fluctuating scalar field , obeying dirichlet boundary conditions ( `` dirichlet scalar '' ) .",
    "we compute the casimir interaction energies that give rise to forces between the rigid surfaces .",
    "this allows for a quantitative determination of validity bounds of approximation methods such as the pfa , some results of which have already been presented in a recent letter @xcite .",
    "we detail significant improvements of the numerical algorithms which facilitate high - precision calculations . apart from numerical discretization errors which are kept at or below the 0.1% level",
    ", no quantum - field - theoretic approximation is needed .",
    "our results further strengthen the agreement with recently obtained analytic solutions for medium or larger curvature @xcite and for small curvature @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the casimir energies for the dirichlet scalar should generally not be taken as an estimate for those for the electromagnetic ( em ) field , leaving especially the experimentally most used sphere - plate case as a pressing open problem .",
    "nevertheless , a comparison with other techniques can meaningfully be performed , and the validity constraints that we derive , e.g. , for the pfa hold independently of the type of boundary condition , since the pfa approach makes no reference to the nature of the fluctuating field .",
    "if an experiment is performed outside the pfa validity ranges determined below , any comparison of the data with theory using the pfa has no firm basis .",
    "we also revisit casimir s classic parallel - plate configuration , first because further algorithmic strategies can easily be illustrated here ; and second , we thereby obtain a mapping between the @xmath0 dimensional casimir effect and characteristic properties of a random - chain polymer ensemble ( say , in 3 space dimensions ) , due to the use of path integrals in the worldline method .",
    "our work is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : cew ] , we briefly review elements of the worldline formulation for casimir configurations as well as the basic ideas of worldline numerics . in section [ sec : wacc ] , the construction of our new worldline algorithms is detailed for various casimir configurations .",
    "we present our conclusions in sect .",
    "[ sec : c ] .",
    "we close this introduction with a brief review of casimir curvature effects and the pfa ; the latter is not only a simple ( though potentially misleading ) approximation , but also provides for a useful normalization for our numerical results .",
    "an intriguing property of the casimir effect has always been its geometry dependence .",
    "as long as the typical curvature radii @xmath2 of the surfaces are large compared to the surface separation @xmath3 , the pfa is assumed to provide for a good approximation . in this approach",
    ", the curved surfaces are viewed as a superposition of infinitesimal parallel plates @xcite .",
    "the casimir interaction energy is obtained by an integration of the parallel - plate energy applied to the infinitesimal elements .",
    "part of the curvature effect is introduced by the choice of a suitable integration measure which is generally ambiguous , as discussed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "for the case of a sphere with radius @xmath4 at a ( minimal ) distance @xmath3 from a plate , the pfa result at next - to - leading order reads @xmath5 where the upper ( lower ) coefficient in braces holds for the so - called plate - based ( sphere - based ) pfa .",
    "they represent two limiting cases of the pfa and have often been assumed to span the error bars for the true result .",
    "furthermore , @xmath6 for an em field or a complex scalar , and @xmath7 for a real scalar field .    the first field - theoretic confirmation of the zeroth - order result @xmath8 has been obtained within the semi - classical approximation in @xcite .",
    "we will use this zeroth - order interaction energy ( and its analogue for the cylinder - plate configuration ) as a normalizer for our numerical estimates . as an advantage ,",
    "any deviation from this result can be interpreted as a true quantum - induced casimir curvature effect .",
    "future experiments are indeed expected to become sensitive to the first - order curvature correction , which therefore is of particular interest to us .",
    "conceptually , the pfa is in contradiction with heisenberg s uncertainty principle , since the quantum fluctuations are assumed to probe the surfaces only locally at each infinitesimal element .",
    "however , fluctuations are not localizable , but at least probe the surface in a whole neighborhood . in this manner , the curvature information enters the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "this quantum mechanism is immediately visible in the worldline formulation of the casimir problem .",
    "therein , the sum over fluctuations is mapped onto a feynman path integral , see below .",
    "each path ( worldline ) can be viewed as a random spacetime trajectory of a quantum fluctuation .",
    "owing to a generic spatial extent of the worldlines , the path integral directly samples the curvature properties of the surfaces @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall from @xcite how the casimir effect for a real scalar field @xmath9 satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions can be described in the worldline formalism . for this",

    "we concentrate on casimir forces between disconnected rigid bodies which we represent by a time - independent potential @xmath19 ; the potentials @xmath20 for the single bodies have pairwise disjoint supports , i.e. , @xmath21 for all @xmath22 and @xmath23 . from the effective action",
    ", we obtain the casimir energy by scaling out the trivial time integration , @xmath24 for the casimir force , only the portion of the casimir energy which depends on the relative position of the objects is relevant .",
    "this portion can conveniently be extracted from the total casimir energy by subtracting the ( self-)energies of the single objects .",

    "any worldline that intersects the surfaces does not satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "all worldlines that intersect both surfaces thus should be removed from the ensemble of allowed fluctuations , thereby contributing to the negative casimir interaction energy .",

    "for the numerical evaluation of the expectation value eq .  , two discretizations are required : first , the path integral is approximated by a finite sum over an ensemble of @xmath50 random paths @xmath51 , each of them forming a closed loop in space(-time ) .",

    "although this corresponds to a loss of generality , we believe that the strategies which we describe in the following , e.g. , for the sphere - plate configuration , are examples for a general set of algorithmic tools which will be useful also for other casimir configurations .",
    "the general structure of a worldline algorithm for computing casimir interaction energies is summarized by eq .  .",
    "the only part of the algorithm that depends on the geometry consists of a diagnostic routine which checks whether a given loop ( for given @xmath71 and @xmath49 intersects with ( more than one of ) the surfaces @xmath72 .",
