    "a century after the birth of general relativity , we now take for granted the existence of various stationary spacelike slicings of stationary spacetimes which have certain special geometrical properties useful in studying the astrophysical consequences of say , black hole spacetimes .",

    "we here survey the various categories of such useful slicings for nonrotating and rotating black hole spacetimes , but starting with the limiting flat minkowski spacetime which allows the greatest variety of examples of special slicings .    among the observer - defined slicings of black hole spacetimes",

    "smarr and york @xcite pioneered linking the preservation of kinematical properties of the slicing to the choice of time lines in an evolving spacetime , while constant mean curvature slicings were seen as privileged from the point of view of the initial value problem even earlier @xcite .",
    "special spherically symmetric slicings of the nonrotating schwarzschild black hole spacetime were first considered by estabrook et al @xcite .",
    "recent work has investigated the geometry associated with analogue black holes @xcite and shown that neither intrinsically flat nor conformally flat slicings of the kerr spacetime exist @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis of the cauchy problem of general relativity has also led to the introduction of spacetime slicings useful in simplifying the evolution equations , like harmonic slicing @xcite ( and closely related time gauges @xcite ) , defined by requiring the time coordinate of the spacetime associated with the slicing to be a harmonic function .",
