    "<S> we show that isotropic helicoids may be engineered and used to find different helical regions in complex flows , with potential new applications in microfluidics , chemistry and medical manufacturing . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest observable that is statistically sensitive to spatial reflections of the carrying flow is given by its helicity averaged over a volume  @xmath9 : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the local flow helicity , defined as the product of the velocity @xmath12 and vorticity @xmath13 of the flow . under a spatial reflection @xmath14 of the flow , </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : isotropic_helicoid_both ] , if the right - handed particle experience a difference , @xmath3 , between the fluid velocity @xmath12 and its own velocity @xmath19 , such that the vector @xmath3 is perpendicular to the plane of one of the great circles , the particle obtains a net torque @xmath4 parallel to @xmath20 in addition to the drag force @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this net torque is a consequence of the vanes being positioned at the same angle along the great circles . </S>",
    "<S> the three great circles give three directions in which the applied velocity difference results in a torque parallel to @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> linear superposition implies that a velocity difference applied in _ any _ direction results in a torque parallel to that direction . </S>",
