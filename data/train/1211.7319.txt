    "the first step in describing the interaction between many particles is to determine their pair potential or the forces among a single pair .",
    "if the governing physical equations are linear ( like for gravity or electrostatics ) , this approach yields a quantitatively reliable description of the physical system considered , based on the linear superposition principle .",
    "however , if nonlinearities are present , linear superposition of pair potentials is no longer accurate and nonadditivity gives rise to many - body effects .",
    "these latter effects can lead , e.g. , to a strengthening or weakening of the total force acting on a particle surrounded by more than a single other one , a change of sign of that force , or the appearance of stable or unstable configurations .",
    "many - body effects appear in rather diverse systems such as nuclear matter  , superconductivity  @xcite , colloidal suspensions  @xcite , quantum - electrodynamic casimir forces  @xcite , polymers  @xcite , nematic colloids  @xcite , and noble gases with van der waals forces acting among them  @xcite . each of these systems is characterized by a wide range of time and length scales . integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with small scales ( such as the solvent of colloidal solutes or polymers ) for fixed configurations of the large particles , generates effective interactions among the latter , which are inherently not pairwise additive .",
    "this is the price to be paid for achieving a reduced description of a multicomponent system . driven by these effective interactions the large particles of the system may exhibit collective behavior of their own ( like aggregation or phase separation , see refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite and references therein ) , which can be described much easier if it is governed by pair potentials . in order to be able to judge whether this ansatz is adequate",
    "one has to check the relative magnitude of genuine many - body forces .    in this paper",
    "we assess the quantitative influence of such many - body effects on critical casimir forces ( ccfs )  @xcite .",
    "these long - ranged forces arise as a consequence of the confinement of the order parameter fluctuations in a critical fluid  @xcite .",
    "they have been analyzed paradigmatically by studying the effective interaction between a _",
    "single _ colloidal particle and a homogeneous  @xcite or inhomogeneous  @xcite container wall as well as between _ two isolated _ colloidal particles  @xcite upon approaching the critical point of the solvent . here",
    "we add one sphere to the sphere - wall configuration , which is the simplest possibility to study many - body forces .",
    "( the wall mimics a third , very large sphere . )    in order to be able to identify the latter ones one has to resort to a theoretical scheme which allows one to compute the forces between individual pairs and the three - body forces on the same footing .",
    "since these forces are characterized by universal scaling functions , which depend on the various geometrical features of the configuration and on the thermodynamic state , we tackle this task by resorting to field - theoretic mean field theory ( mft ) , which captures the universal scaling functions as the leading contribution to their systematic expansion in terms of @xmath1 spatial dimensions .",
    "experience with corresponding previous studies for simple geometries tells that this approach does yield the relevant qualitative features of the actual universal scaling functions in @xmath2 ; if suitably enhanced by renormalization group arguments these results reach a semi - quantitative status .",
    "we point out that even within this approximation the numerical implementation of this corresponding scheme poses a severe technical challenge .",
    "thus at present this approach appears to be the only feasible one to explore the role of many - body critical casimir forces within the full range of their scaling variables .",
    "accordingly we consider the standard landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian for critical phenomena of the ising bulk universality class , which is given by    @xmath3 = \\int_v{\\rm d}^d\\mathbf{r } \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\nabla\\phi \\right)^2 + \\frac{\\tau}{2}\\phi^2 + \\frac{u}{4!}\\phi^4 \\right\\ } ~,\\ ] ]    with suitable boundary conditions ( bcs ) . in the case of a binary liquid mixture near its consolute ( demixing ) point , the order parameter @xmath4 is proportional to the deviation of the local concentration of one of the two species from the critical concentration .",
