    "the moduli space @xmath0 of stable curves of genus @xmath1 has been an important subject of study in algebraic geometry .",
    "it is a smooth deligne - mumford stack ( orbifold ) .",
    "the moduli space @xmath2 of stable maps of degree @xmath3 from genus-@xmath1 curves to the projective space @xmath4 is a natural generalization of @xmath0 , but this generalization leads us from a smooth space to a space that can contain singularities as bad as possible ( vakil s murphy s law ) . for the purposes of some programs ,",
    "it is important to obtain the ( local ) structures of the moduli space @xmath2 .    a point @xmath5 $ ] of @xmath2 is ( the isomorphism class of ) a map @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an algebraic curve of arithmetic genus @xmath1 with at worse nodal singularities such that the automorphism group of the map @xmath5 $ ] is finite . here",
    "a nodal singularity locally is given by @xmath8 ; the point corresponding to the origin is called a node . an automorphism of @xmath5 $ ] means a morphism @xmath9 such that @xmath10 the automorphism group of the map @xmath5 $ ] is finite if and only if any genus-0 irreducible component of @xmath7 contains at least three nodes whenever it is contracted by the map and any genus-1 irreducible component of @xmath7 contains at least one node whenever it is contracted by the map .",
    "one may add @xmath11 marked points to the domain curve @xmath7 away from the nodes and obtain the moduli space of stable maps with @xmath11 markings , denoted @xmath12 .",
    "but , as far as singularity is concerned , @xmath12 and @xmath2 have exactly the same local singularity types simply because each marked point moves in a smooth local domain .",
    "hence , as far as singularity types are concerned , we may only consider moduli spaces without markings .",
    "when @xmath13 , @xmath14 is smooth ( as a stack or orbifold ) ; when @xmath15 , @xmath2 is singular ( as a stack or orbifold ) . indeed ,",
    "if allowing arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath3 , ravi vakil showed that @xmath2 can contain all possible singularity types over @xmath16 .",
    "this seems to be a piece of bad news , but thinking positively , it also makes the spaces @xmath2 ultimately rich as modular singularity models to investigate .    historically though",
    ", @xmath2 was introduced for the ( sole ) purpose of defining the gromov - witten invariants .",
    "an important standing problem in this area is to enumerate the ( virtual ) number of curves with fixed genus and degree in a smooth calabi - yau threefold in @xmath17 , or more generally , in a complete intersection @xmath18 in @xmath4 . in principle",
    ", the curve - counting business on @xmath18 can be done on the ambient space @xmath4 , using the defining equations of @xmath18 .",
    "the moduli space @xmath19 of stable maps of degree @xmath3 from curves of genus @xmath1 to @xmath18 is naturally a submoduli space of @xmath20 .",
    "for example , let us assume that @xmath18 is a smooth hypersurface defined by @xmath21 for some section @xmath22 with some positive integer @xmath23 .",
    "if we let @xmath24 be the universal family over the moduli space @xmath2 with the universal map @xmath25 and let @xmath26 then we have @xmath27 if @xmath28 were locally free , then it would have a natural euler class , and this euler class would bridge the intersection theory on @xmath19 to the intersection theory on @xmath2 . thus , resolving the non - locally free locus of the direct image sheaf @xmath28 is essential in gw theory of complete intersections in @xmath4 . here , by resolving the sheaf , we mean a diagram @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a blowup and @xmath31 such that the direct image sheaf @xmath32 is locally free .",
    "thus , one sees that on the one hand , it is important for gw theory to resolve the sheaf @xmath28 ; on the other hand , it is important for singularity theory to resolve @xmath2 . the two problems are related .",
    "the point of @xcite is that it is more natural to resolve the sheaves @xmath28 first , and at least when the genus is low , resolving the sheaves will also ensure a resolution of the moduli space .    to see this point , observe that a stable map @xmath33\\in \\mpdg$ ] , as a morphism , is given by the data @xmath34 : c\\lra\\pn,\\quad u_i\\in h^0(u\\sta \\so_{\\pn}(1));\\ ] ] its deformation is determined by the combined deformation of the curve @xmath7 and the sections @xmath35 .",
    "since the deformation of the curve is unobstructed , the irregularity of @xmath2 is closely related to the non - local - freeness of the direct image sheaf @xmath36 this alludes that desingularizations of @xmath2 _ should be _ governed by desingularizations of @xmath36 . for genus-1 ,",
    "this is true in the simplest form , a desingularization of @xmath37 implies a desingularization of @xmath38 .",
    "vakil and zinger first discovered a desingularization of the main component of the moduli space @xmath38 in @xcite .",
    "their method is analytic in nature .",
    "they found a natural sequence of blowups that resolve singularities of @xmath38 and then showed that the same blowups also resolve the sheaves @xmath39 .",
    "as hinted in the last paragraph , from the algebro - geometric approach , it is more natural to resolve the sheaves first . in @xcite",
    ", we first obtain local structures of the sheaf @xmath40 .",
    "the structures of @xmath36 allow us to derive local defining equations of the moduli space @xmath38 .",
    "having obtained these local equations , it is rather clear what loci one should blow up , how the resulting space turns out to be smooth , and why the resulting direct image sheaves become locally free .",
    "this note , through some concrete examples , is solely devoted to reveal the structures of the sheaf @xmath41 . by working out these examples ,",
    "we hope the student will familiarize himself / herself with the aspects of families of elliptic curves that are useful for obtaining the local structures of the moduli space of stable maps .    during the summer school , i gave four lectures on tropical curves and their applications to plane enumerative geometry . when the school was over , the organizers asked every speaker to write up his lecture notes for the proceeding .",
    "however , as there have been already several excellent expository articles on tropical curves that the students can easily find on arxiv and i did not feel that i could make any meaningful improvement , instead , i thought that an introductory note on elliptic stable maps should help students to learn this important subject .",
    "the idea is that through some examples the students will gain the intuition about the approach to the local structures of the stable map muduli @xcite .",
    "i hope that the material will be a more converging addition to the proceeding , and it will be more useful for graduate students as well as for researchers . most of the note should be accessible to any graduate student with some backgrounds on algebraic geometry .",
    "_ this note recollects the toy examples that jun li and i calculated in the summer of 07 as the warm - up as well as the guide for our approach toward the general theory @xcite , but , needless to say , all the mistakes in this detailed presentation must be due to my own oversight . _",
    "i thank jun li , from whom i have learned a lot , for the collaboration .",
    "i also thank cms of zhejiang university and the organizers of the summer school , especially lizhen ji , for the excellent environment and for supporting the idea to include this note in the proceeding .",
    "we begin with motivating the setups of our examples .",
    "let @xmath42 be the universal family with the universal map @xmath43 .",
    "as for any sheaf , the question on the structures of the direct image sheaf @xmath44 is ( tale ) local . given any point @xmath45=[u : c \\lra \\pn ] \\in \\mpd,\\ ] ] we choose a small tale neighborhood @xmath46   \\subset \\mpd$ ] . by choosing @xmath23 general hyperplanes @xmath47 of @xmath4 , we can assume that @xmath48 is a simple divisor @xmath49 of degree @xmath50 ( @xmath51 are disjoint ) .",
    "let @xmath52 , then @xmath53 by an tale base change , we may assume that @xmath54 where each @xmath55 is a section of @xmath56 such that @xmath57 . hence , the local structures of @xmath58 is reflected in the structure of @xmath59 .",
    "this motivates us to consider some examples of flat families of elliptic curves , @xmath60 with a section @xmath61 , and study the associated direct image sheaf @xmath62 .",
    "the core @xmath63 of a connected genus - one curve @xmath7 is the unique smallest ( by inclusion ) subcurve of arithmetic genus one .",

    "an elliptic curve @xmath63 attached with 3 rational tails    given any connected genus - one curve @xmath7 , upon removing the core of @xmath7 , the rest of irreducible components are all rational curves ( i.e. , genus zero curves ) , we denote their union by @xmath64",
    ". we will call each connected component of @xmath64 a tail , it is a tree of rational curves .",
    "if there are @xmath65 such connected components , we will say the curve @xmath7 has @xmath65 ( rational ) tails .",

    "so we will study examples of families @xmath60 together with a section @xmath61 having a point @xmath70 such that    * for @xmath71 , the fiber @xmath68 is smooth ; * the fiber @xmath72 is an elliptic curve with @xmath65 tails ; * @xmath61 misses the core of @xmath72 but meets the tails .",

    "we now begin to construct a one - parameter family of genus-1 curves whose central fiber is a smooth elliptic curve attached with a smooth rational curve .",
    "one may consult figure 2 for picture of such a construction .",

    "we make an observation here that any map @xmath125 such that @xmath126 is a scalar multiple of @xmath120 .",
    "this is because @xmath127 and @xmath128 has a basis @xmath129 .",

    ", we see that the @xmath134 restricted to the factor @xmath165 is nontrivial .",
    "so , up to a non - zero scalar , we can assume that it is given by multiplication by @xmath154 .",
