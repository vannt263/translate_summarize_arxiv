    "trace gases play an important role in climate change and air quality of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "spectroscopic techniques are widely used today for measurements of many trace species , and have evolved over the past century from the first use of the sun as a light source to identify atmospheric trace gases .",
    "many different light sources ( e.g. , infrared and uv - visible lamps , lasers , and natural sources such as the sun ) are now conventionally used to identify light - absorbing species as well as determine their concentrations using lambert - beer s law , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the initial intensity of light , @xmath10 is its intensity after traveling through a sample of path length , @xmath11 , with concentration , @xmath12 .",
    "each species has its characteristic absorption cross section , @xmath13 , a measure of its ability to absorb light that varies with wavelength .",
    "the use of ( [ lambert1 ] ) is convenient for multi - component samples in laboratory spectrometers , but it is more difficult to determine the value of @xmath9 in the atmosphere over a large wavelength range .",
    "a new method , differential optical absorption spectroscopy ( doas ) , was introduced in the 1970s @xcite to analyze atmospheric trace gas concentrations .",
    "doas analysis separates the trace gas absorptions , which typically vary quickly with wavelength , from features that vary slowly with wavelength , e.g. , light scattering processes by molecules and aerosols .",
    "differential cross sections are then defined relative to this new broad background in place of the true @xmath9 .",
    "several important trace gases were measured for the first time with doas , e.g. , hono , @xmath14 , bro , clo in the troposphere , and oclo and bro in the stratosphere .",
    "a large number of other molecules absorb in the uv and the visible wavelength region and most aromatic hydrocarbons can also be detected .",
    "an advantage of doas is the ability to measure absolute trace gas concentrations _ in situ_. doas is therefore especially useful for measuring highly reactive species such as the free radicals oh , @xmath14 , or bro , and it provides a powerful tool for studying emissions , transformation and transport of chemicals throughout the troposphere and stratosphere .",
    "it can also help to understand the influence of atmospheric chemistry on climate and air quality .",
    "a detailed description of doas can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in general , doas spectra contain overlapping absorption structures which consist of complex multiple scales and peaks .",
    "they must be separated by the analysis routine to retrieve the concentrations of the trace gases .",
    "least squares techniques are most often used for analysis of doas spectra , with the use of high pass filters to fit or separate out the slowly varying components .",
    "for example , the approach described in @xcite applies a polynomial fit to remove the broad ( slow - varying ) spectral features , and known reference spectra to retrieve the concentrations of reference gases .",
    "however , the existing doas approaches have two limitations : 1 ) the condition of least squares ( _ that errors are normally distributed _ ) is often violated .",
    "this suggests that a different norm other than @xmath15 ( least squares ) norm should be used ; 2 ) the fitting residuals for atmospheric samples are in most cases not pure noise due to imperfect references , atmospheric turbulence , instrument effects , and unknown trace gases . among other interesting problems ,",
    "the identification of gas structures in the fitting residuals is of great importance .",
    "the method in this paper has been developed to address these issues , in the hope of providing a tool for atmospheric chemists to analyze the residuals for possible hidden trace gases .",
    "the method is designed to deal with the following three major challenges .",
    "first , doas spectra are complex multi - scale multi - peak structural data containing slow - varying features , structured signals due to the trace gases , and instrumental noise .",
    "hence a multi - resolution analysis tool is needed for scale decomposition .",
    "second , the identification of gases from the residuals is actually a problem of blind source separation ( bss ) as both the trace gases ( including their numbers ) and mixing process are not known .",
    "a major problem is to find a working assumption on the source ( hidden trace gas ) signals and effective bss algorithms .",
    "third , the new objective function for data fitting should not only overcome the limitations of least squares fitting , but also help to maintain the non - negativity . to tackle these problems ,",
    "we have made an initial attempt of developing a semi - blind approach which contains three steps .",
    "the first step uses multi - resolution analysis to remove the very slow ( e.g. scattering ) and very fast components ( noise ) in the doas spectral data matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the second step decomposes the preprocessed data @xmath1 in the first step into a linear combination of the reference spectra plus a remainder , or @xmath2 , where columns of matrix @xmath3 are known reference spectra , the matrix @xmath4 contains the unknown non - negative coefficients .",
    "the second step is carried out by solving a convex minimization problem @xmath16 , where the norm is a hybrid @xmath6 norm that helps to maintain the non - negativity of @xmath4 .",
    "the third step performs a blind independent component analysis of the remainder matrix @xmath7 to extract remnant gas components .",
    "our method can be useful for separating unknown sources from the residuals after any known reference spectra have been first deployed to fit the data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review the essentials of doas and the existing approach , then introduce our method . in section 3 , we illustrate the proposed method in processing a set of doas experimental data , and show satisfactory numerical results . concluding remarks are in section 4 .",
    "a typical experimental setup for a doas instrument consists of a continuous light source , e.g. , a xe - arc lamp , a light - absorbing sample ( the atmosphere or gases in a chamber ) , a grating spectrometer , and an optical detector .",
    "it is also possible to use the light from the sun or moon , or scattered sun light as light sources @xcite .",
    "the typical length of the light path in the atmosphere ranges from several hundred meters to many kilometers and @xmath17 100 m in laboratory doas experiments .",
    "the light of intensity @xmath9 passes through the sample , is typically dispersed by a grating spectrometer and is measured by a detector . during its way through the sample the light undergoes extinction due to absorption processes by trace gases and scattering by air molecules and aerosol particles . in the atmosphere ,",
    "the intensity @xmath10 at the end of the light path is given by lambert - beer s law , @xmath18 + n(\\lambda)\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the absorption cross section of a trace gas @xmath20 , @xmath21 is its number density .",
    "@xmath11 is the length of the light path .",
    "the rayleigh extinction by gases and mie extinction by aerosols are described here by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the measurement noise .",
    "the basic idea of doas is the separation of the cross section @xmath25 in which @xmath26 represents broad spectral features and the differential cross section @xmath27 represents narrow spectral structures that are of interest for identification and quantification of the trace gases . if one considers only @xmath27 , interferences with rayleigh and mie extinction are avoided .",
    "the mathematical description of this process is a convolution of @xmath10 with the instrument function @xmath28 of the spectrometer , @xmath29 @xmath30 \\ ; h(\\lambda ' ) \\mathrm{d}\\lambda'\\\\     =      \\int^{\\delta \\lambda}_{-\\delta \\lambda } i'_0(\\lambda-\\lambda')\\exp \\biggl",

    "suppose that there are @xmath38 known trace gases in the data .",
    "the logarithm of the above equation becomes @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 represents the broad spectral features .",
    "the noise @xmath42 . in the experiment ,",
    "the wavelength range is mapped onto @xmath43 discrete pixels of the detector .",
    "the sampled data points form @xmath43-dimensional column vectors of a data matrix @xmath0 .",
    "suppose there are @xmath44 measurements , then @xmath45 \\in \\mathbb{r}^{p\\times n}$ ] whose column vectors are recorded doas data points . equation ( [ log ] ) in matrix form is : @xmath46 where the columns of matrix @xmath3 correspond to the reference spectra of the known trace gases ; the matrix @xmath4 contains non - negative coefficients ; the matrix @xmath47 includes the slow - varying components , and the matrix @xmath48 contains the noise components .",
    "most doas approaches use the least squares methods to calculate @xmath4 due to its computational simplicity . to deal with the problem that the data contain both broad and narrow spectral features ,",
    "a high pass filter is needed to remove the broad spectral features .",
    "it is common to use polynomials to model and filter out the slowly varying parts from the narrow trace gas absorption .",
    "equation ( [ modeleq ] ) is written as follows in @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 where the polynomial @xmath50 models the broad spectral structures .",
    "given the order of polynomial and the known reference spectra , ( [ poly ] ) can be solved with a least squares method .",
    "the polynomial fitting however has the following drawbacks : ( 1 ) the order of the polynomial is determined empirically and different orders might be used for different data ; 2 ) the non - negativity of the concentration is not guaranteed during the fitting .",
    "an open problem after the fitting is how to identify and extract trace gases from the fitting residuals besides the noise . to address these issues",
    ", we propose a three step method in the next section .",
    "doas data can cover a range of scales and contain high frequency ( @xmath171 nm ) artifact structures , for example due to pixel - to - pixel variability in the detector , while the reference spectra of the trace gases contain fewer peaks and peak widths on the order of several nm .",
    "hence it is helpful to remove the fast varying artifacts from the spectra data by multi - resolution analysis .",
    "in addition , the broad features ( slow - varying parts ) in the data need to be eliminated in order to fit the reference spectra of the known trace gases .",
    "we propose to use the empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) to extract these components .",
    "the detailed description of emd can be found in @xcite .",
    "the emd method does not assume anything about the data , contrary to fourier methods where data is assumed linear and stationary .",
    "emd handles also non - stationary and nonlinear data .",
    "the concept of emd has been developed rapidly in many areas of science and engineering since huang et al .",
    "@xcite invented emd .",
    "its key feature is to decompose a signal into so - called intrinsic mode function ( imf ) .",
    "the essential step extracting an imf is to identify an oscillation embedded in a signal from local time scale . considering a signal @xmath51 between two consecutive local extrema ( say , two minima at times @xmath52 and @xmath53 )",
    ", we can heuristically define a ( local ) high frequency part @xmath54 , where @xmath55 corresponds to the oscillation terminating at the two minima and passing through the maximum in between . for the picture to be complete , we also identify the corresponding ( local ) low - frequency part , or local _ trend _ , @xmath56 so that we have @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "assuming that this is done in some proper way for all the oscillations in the entire signal , we get an intrinsic mode function as well as a residual consisting of all local trends . the procedure can then be repeated on the residual , and constitutive components of a signal can be iteratively extracted .",
    "the emd method decomposes the doas data into a finite number of components of different frequencies .",
    "the advantage of emd is that it is completely data - driven ( no need to specify a parameter such as the order of a fitting polynomial ) , fast and automatic .",
    "[ dosadata1 ] shows a typical doas spectrum of a trace gas mixture containing hono , whose reference spectrum is also shown in the bottom panel .",
    "[ result1 ] shows the fast and slow components extracted from the doas data in fig .",
    "[ dosadata1 ] .",
    "the emd preprocessed ( high - passed ) data @xmath1 satisfies the following model @xmath59 where the columns of matrix @xmath3 are the reference spectra of the known trace gases , and those of @xmath4 matrix contains their concentrations , and @xmath7 is the fitting residual which might contain the instrument noise , hidden trace gas structures , etc . for the estimation of the concentration matrix @xmath4 , we minimize the following constrained objective function : @xmath60 for a proper choice of the norm .",
    "there are many kinds of norms available , e.g. , @xmath15 ( least squares ) , @xmath61 ( least absolute deviations ) .",
    "the regular least squares method ( ignoring the non - negative constraint on @xmath4 ) is the conventional choice , if the unknown noise @xmath48 is assumed to be gaussian .",
    "however , it is rather sensitive to the outliers in the data , even one outlier can drastically change the estimation .",
    "the least absolute deviations ( @xmath61 norm ) is more robust to outliers in the data , however it is less effective if the peaks in @xmath48 are not isolated ( or sparse ) .",
    "we find that a hybrid @xmath15 and @xmath61 norm ( @xmath15 on small peaks and @xmath61 on large peaks ) , or a huber estimator @xcite , is able to resist the influence of outliers , and maintain non - negativity of @xmath4 for our data fitting task .",
    "the huber norm is both regular and convex .",
    "the corresponding nonlinear function @xmath62 is a parabola ( @xmath15 ) in the vicinity of zero , and increases linearly ( @xmath61 ) at @xmath63 for any positive constant @xmath64 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath65 the non - negativity of @xmath4 under the huber norm indicates that the choice fits the empirical distribution of the noise @xmath48 arising from detection and photon statistics @xcite .",
    "[ huber_example ] is an example showing the superiority of huber s estimator over least squares : it is resistant to outliers in the data , while the least squares result deviated significantly from the exact line due to the two outliers .",
    "least squares assigns equal weighting to each observation ; the weights for the huber estimator decline when @xmath63 ( see the weight functions in fig .",
    "[ huber_example ] ) .",
    "the value @xmath64 for the huber estimator is called a tuning constant ; smaller values of @xmath64 produce more resistance to outliers , but at the expense of lower efficiency when the errors are normally distributed . the tuning constant is generally selected to yield high efficiency in the normal case ; in particular , @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 is the standard deviation of the errors ) .",
    "the minimization of huber s objective can be achieved by the method of iterative re - weighted least squares . for the doas data in our numerical experiments",
    ", we found that the huber s estimator produced non - negative solutions @xmath4 without explicit enforcement of non - negativity constraint .",
    "the theoretical underpinning is under further study . in the residual of huber",
    "estimation , there might be spectral structures ( one or many ) of trace gases buried in noise , or just random noise . in either case",
    ", we decompose the residuals in a blind fashion due to the lack of the knowledge of the hidden trace gases .",
    "the source signal assumption required for the decomposition is that the spectra of different trace gases are statistically independent ( orthogonal ) .",
    "this appears to be a reasonable working assumption for many trace gases",
    ". independent component analysis ( ica ) can now be readily applied .     plus noise .",

    "ica finds the independent components in the mixtures by maximizing the statistical independence ( minimizing mutual information ) of the estimated components .",
    "mathematically , given the mixture matrix @xmath70 and the number of independent source components @xmath71 , ica finds a full rank matrix @xmath72 such that the output matrix @xmath73 given by @xmath74 contains columns ( recovered source signals ) as independent from each other as possible . here",
    "@xmath44 is the number of residuals from the data fitting , @xmath43 is the number of wavelength pixels .",
    "the columns of @xmath75 correspond to the decomposed independent source signals .",
    "we may choose one of many ways to approximate independence , and this choice governs the form of the ica algorithm .",
    "the two broadest definitions of independence for ica are : ( 1 ) minimization of mutual information ; ( 2 ) maximization of non - gaussianity .",
    "the non - gaussianity family of ica algorithms use kurtosis and negentropy .",
    "the minimization of mutual information family of ica algorithms use the kullback - leibler divergence and maximum - entropy , however , the knowledge of source signal probability distribution function ( pdf ) is needed .",
    "algorithms for ica include infomax @xcite , fastica @xcite , and jade @xcite .",
    "we opt for jade because jade is based on cumulants ( 2nd and 4th order statistics ) and the approximate joint diagonalization of cumulant matrices ( hence does not rely on pdf information of source signals ) . for moderate number of sources ,",
    "it is more direct and stable than iterative methods such as infomax @xcite and fastica @xcite .",
    "it was recently found @xcite that the infomax method @xcite may even diverge and that it only converges in a weak sense under proper rescaling and soft dynamic control of the iterations .",
    "the most attractive aspect of jade is that it does not require parameter tuning ( e.g. choosing the learning parameter in the iterative methods ) . in general",
    ", ica algorithms can not identify the actual number of source signals , so this number needs to be found by other means , for example by human evaluation of the end results . in our decomposition of huber residuals",
    ", we tested a range for this number , and pinpointed the one with the most reliable and meaningful outcomes when calibrated with the knowledge of the existing trace gas spectral properties .",
    "spectra of chemical mixtures were collected using an environmental chamber @xcite for which doas is one of the analytical techniques used to measure species during experiments .",
    "[ doas_setup ] shows a simplified schematic of the chamber and optical arrangement for doas .",

    "spectra can also be collected before and after addition of ultrapure air and each gaseous analyte of interest through various ports .",

    "the light beam enters the chamber through a quartz window and undergoes multiple reflections using white cell mirrors @xcite through the gas mixture in the chamber .",
    "the multiple reflections increase the path length of the light beam through the sample to a total path length of @xmath11 = 52 m. the light beam exits the chamber through the quartz window and is focused on the entrance slit of a monochromator ( jobin yvon - spex , model hr460 ) with a diode array detector ( princeton instruments , model pda-1024 st121 ) .",
    "the grating ( 1200 grooves @xmath77 blazed at 330 nm ) gives a dispersion of @xmath78 nm @xmath79 and the detector has 1024 channels giving each spectrum a total wavelength range of @xmath80 44 nm .",
    "spectra can be collected in different wavelength ranges by moving the grating motor .",
    "changes in grating position as well as temperature lead to changes in dispersion of the light beam on the detector .",
    "this is taken into account in the least squares analysis by allowing for shifting or linear compression / expansion in one or more reference spectra along the wavelength axis to obtain the best fit .",
    "the use of such techniques is standard and user controlled to correlate wavelengths with channels of the detector .",
    "absolute dispersion and wavelength were calibrated using a mercury lamp spectrum that was recorded daily and at the beginning of each experiment .",
