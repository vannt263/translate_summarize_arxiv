    "recent experimental observations of new particles at @xmath14-factories , have revitalized the field of hadron spectroscopy . while some of these observed states , like the @xmath15 @xcite , can be understood as @xmath16 states @xcite , these observations suggest that the spectrum of the charmonium states is much more rich than suggested by the quark - antiquark model and may include tetraquark or molecular states . in particular , the @xmath17 @xcite , with quantum numbers @xmath18 ,",
    "was the first observed state that did not fit easily the charmonium spectrum .",
    "it also presents a strong isospin violating decay that disfavors a @xmath19 assignment .",
    "the @xmath20 , recently observed in the @xmath21 decay mode @xcite , is the most intriguing one since , being a charged state , it can not be a pure @xmath16 state .    besides the @xmath17 and @xmath20 mesons , at least three peaks of the @xmath5 family : the @xmath0 @xcite , the @xmath22 @xcite or / and @xmath23 @xcite ( that here we call @xmath1 ) and the @xmath2 @xcite can not be easily fited in the charmonium spectrum @xcite . since the only observed decay channels for these states are those containing the @xmath24 ( for @xmath0 ) or @xmath25 ( for the others ) plus a pair of pions , in ref .",
    "@xcite this was considered as an indication that these mesons contain a particular charmonium resonance , @xmath24 or @xmath25 , that stays intact inside a more complex hadronic structure .",
    "a critical information for understanding the structure of these states is wether the pion pair comes from a resonance state . from the di - pion invariant mass spectra shown in ref .",
    "@xcite there is some indication that only the @xmath2 has a well defined intermediate state consistent with @xmath26 @xcite . due to this fact and the proximity of the mass of the @xmath27 system with the mass of the @xmath2 state , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath2 was considered as a @xmath28 bound state .",
    "the @xmath2 was also suggested to be a baryonium state @xcite and a canonical 5 @xmath29s@xmath30 @xmath16 state @xcite .    in the case of @xmath0 , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was considered as a @xmath31-scalar - diquark @xmath32-scalar - antidiquark in a @xmath33-wave state . in a naive estimate , the mass of a @xmath31-scalar - diquark would be approximately equal to the mass of the @xmath34 meson . since a unit of angular momentum",
    "can be estimated as the mass difference between the nucleon and the lowest - lying odd parity excited state , and it is about 600 mev @xcite , one would expect the mass of a @xmath31-scalar - diquark @xmath32-scalar - antidiquark in a @xmath33-wave state about 4540 mev , almost 300 mev above the @xmath0 mass .",
    "here we use the qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite to study the two - point function for a diquark - antidiquark tetraquark state with a symmetric spin distribution : @xmath35_{s=1}[\\bar{c}\\bar{s}]_{s=0}+ [ cs]_{s=0}[\\bar{c}\\bar{s}]_{s=1}$ ] , to see if any of these new @xmath36 mesons can be described by such a current . in previous calculations ,",
    "the qcdsr approach was used to study the @xmath17 considered as a diquark - antidiquark state @xcite , and the @xmath20 meson , considered as a @xmath37 molecular state @xcite . in both cases a very good agreement with the experimental mass was obtained .",

    "the two - point correlation function is given by : _",

    "( [ inv ] ) : ^phen(q^2)=-ds ( s)q^2-s+i+ , [ phen ] where @xmath40 is the spectral density and the dots represent subtraction terms .",
    "the spectral density is described , as usual , as a single sharp pole representing the lowest resonance plus a smooth continuum representing higher mass states : ( s)&=&^2(s - m_y^2 ) + ^cont(s ) , [ den ] where @xmath41 is proportional to the meson decay constant @xmath42 , which parametrizes the coupling of the vector meson , @xmath36 , to the current @xmath43 : [ eq : decay ] 0 | j_|y = f_ym_y^4 _  =  m_y _  .    for simplicity",
    ", it is assumed that the continuum contribution to the spectral density , @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ den ] ) , vanishes bellow a certain continuum threshold @xmath45 . above this threshold , it is assumed to be given by the result obtained with the ope .",
    "therefore , one uses the ansatz @xcite ^cont(s)=^ope(s)(s - s_0 ) , with ^ope(s)=1im[^ope(s ) ] .    in the ope side , we work at leading order in @xmath6 and consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension six .",
    "we keep the term which is linear in the strange - quark mass @xmath7 .",
    "we use the momentum space expression for the charm quark propagator , while the light - quark part of the correlation function is calculated in the coordinate - space .",
    "the correlation function , @xmath46 , in the ope side can also be written in terms of a dispersion relation : ^ope(q^2)=_4m_c^2^ds ^ope(s)s - q^2 . therefore , after making an inverse - laplace ( or borel ) transform on both sides , and transferring the continuum contribution to the ope side , the sum rule for the vector meson @xmath36 can be written as ^2e^-m_y^2/m^2=_4m_c^2^s_0ds",

    "[ 8m2 ] where the integration limits are given by @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the contribution of dimension - six condensates @xmath50 is neglected , since it is suppressed by the loop factor @xmath51 . in eq .",
    "( [ 8m2 ] ) we have included , for completeness a part of the dimension-8 condensate , related with the mixed condensate - quark condensate contribution .",
    "we should note that a complete evaluation of these contributions require more involved analysis including a non - trivial choice of the factorization assumption basis @xcite .",
    "( [ 8m2 ] ) the @xmath52 term is treated separately because its imaginary part is proportional to delta functions and , therefore , can be easily integrated @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to notice that the current in eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) does not get contribution from the quark condensates when @xmath53 .",
    "this is very different from the ope behavior obtained to the scalar - diquark axial - antidiquark current used for the @xmath17 meson in ref .",
    "@xcite , but very similar to the ope behavior obtained for the axial double - charmed meson @xmath54 , also described by a scalar - diquark axial - antidiquark current @xcite .",
    "the values used for the quark masses and condensates are @xcite : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 with @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "we evaluate the sum rules in the borel range @xmath63 , and in the @xmath45 range @xmath64 gev . to fix the continuum threshold range we extract the mass from the sum rule , for a given @xmath45 , and accept such value of @xmath45 if the obtained mass is around 0.5 gev smaller than @xmath65 .    from fig",
    "[ figconvtcc ] we see that we obtain a quite good ope convergence for @xmath66 gev@xmath67 .",
    "therefore , we fix the lower value of @xmath68 in the sum rule window as @xmath69 gev@xmath67 .",
    "this figure also shows that dimension - eight condensate contributions is very small .",
    "since this is not a complete evaluation of the dimension - eight condensates contribution , it will be neglected in this calculation .    in fig .",
    "[ figpvc ] we show the comparison between pole and continuum contributions for @xmath70 gev , and we see that for @xmath71 , the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum contribution . therefore , we fix @xmath72 as the upper limit of the borel window for @xmath70 gev .",
    "the same analysis for the other values of the continuum threshold gives @xmath73 gev@xmath67 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 gev@xmath67 for @xmath76 .",
    "we then consider , for each value of @xmath45 , the range of @xmath68 values from 3.2 @xmath77 until the one allowed by the pole dominance criteria given above .    to extract the mass @xmath55 we take the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) with respect to @xmath78 , and divide the result by eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ figmx ] , we show the @xmath36 meson mass , for different values of @xmath65 , in the relevant sum rule window , with the upper and lower validity limits indicated . from this figure",
    "we see that we get a very good borel stability for @xmath55 .    to check the dependence of our results with the value of the charm quark mass , we fix @xmath79 and vary the quark masses and the quark condensate in the range given above .",
    "we see that the results are not very sensitive to the changes in the values of the quark masses and condensate , the main source of uncertainty being the continuum threshold . adding the errors in quadrature we finally get m_y = ( 4.650.10 )  , [ ymass ] in excelent agreement with the mass of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "therefore we conclude that the meson @xmath2 can be described by a tetraquark state with a spin configuration given by scalar and vector diquarks .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , from the di - pion invariant mass spectra shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is some indication that only the @xmath2 has a well defined intermediate state consistent with @xmath26 .",
    "the di - pion invariant mass spectra for the pions in the decay @xmath80 could be consistent with a broad intermediate state with a mass around 600 mev .",
    "this could be a @xmath81 scalar meson @xcite and , in this case , one would not expect strange quarks in the current in eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) .    replacing the strange quarks in eq.([field ] ) by the generic light quark @xmath82 and using @xmath83 , we show , in fig  [ figope43 ] , the ope convergence using @xmath84    since now the quark condensate contribution is multiplyed by the light quark mass , its cotribution is now neglegible . from this figure",
    "we see that we get a good ope convergence for @xmath85 .",
    "again the upper limits for @xmath68 are obtained by imposing that the pole contribution should be bigger than the continuum contribution .",
    "these values are given in table i for each value of @xmath65 .",
    "+    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     again we get a very good borel stability as a function of @xmath68 , in the allowed sum rule window , as can be seen by fig .",
    "[ mmolq ] . considering the variations on @xmath68 , @xmath45 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the regions indicated above we get : m_d_0|d^*= ( 4.270.10 )  , in excelent agreement with the mass of the meson @xmath0 .",
    "again , to conclude if we can associate this molecular state with the meson @xmath0 we need a better understanding of the di - pion invariant mass spectra for the pions in the decay @xmath88 . from the spectra given in ref .",
    "@xcite , it seems that the @xmath0 is consistent with a non - strange molecular state @xmath89 .    regarding charmed non - strange scalar mesons , a broad enhancement ( @xmath90 )",
    "mass distribution has been observed @xcite .",
    "its mass is now compiled as @xcite @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath89 threshold is around 2360 mev and is 100 mev above the molecule mass in eq .",
    "( [ massmol ] ) .",
    "in conclucion , we have presented a qcdsr analysis of the two - point functions for tetraquark charmonium states with @xmath5 , to study the charmonium @xmath36 mesons recently observed by babar and belle collaborations .",
    "we have considered two kinds of currents : a diquark - antidiquark tetraquark state with a symmetric spin distribution @xmath92_{s=1}[\\bar{c}\\bar{q}]_{s=0}+ [ cq]_{s=0}[\\bar{c}\\bar{q}]_{s=1}$ ] ( where the generic quark @xmath82 can be either a light @xmath93 or @xmath94 quark , or a strange , @xmath95 , quark ) , and a molecular state with a symmetrical combination between scalar and vector charmed mesons .",
    "our findings indicate that the @xmath2 meson can be very well described by a diquark - antidiquark @xmath96 tetraquark state .",
    "this quark content is consistent with the di - pion invariant mass spectra shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows that there is some indication that the @xmath2 has a well defined di - pion intermediate state consistent with @xmath26 .    in the case of the @xmath1 meson",
    ", its mass can be reproduced , considering the errors , if we assume that it is a diquark - antidiquark @xmath97 tetraquark state , or a @xmath10 molecule . since an indication from its quark content",
    "can be obtained from the di - pion invariant mass spectra in the decay @xmath98 , we need a better understanding of it before we can reach a definite conclusion about its structure .",
