    "thermodynamic properties of hot and dense matter out of quarks and gluons are of theoretical and experimental importance . to this end the monte - carlo method on the lattice has worked quite successfully to simulate the matter at high temperature from the first principle , that is , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that such hot and dense matter has been created in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) located at bnl .",
    "since the baryon stopping power in the nucleus - nucleus collision is small at the rhic ( top ) energy @xmath0 , the created matter is nearly free from the net baryon density , and thus , the corresponding baryon chemical potential is much smaller than the temperature .",
    "we are facing two experimental possibilities for the future exploration of the qcd phase diagram : one is going toward even hotter matter as planned in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "the other one is realizing denser matter , which is accessible by collisions at smaller energy with larger baryon stopping power .",
    "the formation of baryon - rich matter is within the scope of the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) at gsi and the systematic energy scan is also under discussion in the future plan for rhic with emphasis on the qcd critical point search .",
    "the present work is focused on the latter ; the thermodynamic properties of matter with a finite quark chemical potential @xmath1 whose magnitude is comparable to the temperature @xmath2 .    the lattice qcd simulation has a serious limitation if a finite chemical potential is turned on in the dirac operator  @xcite .",
    "that is , the notorious sign problem prevents us from applying the monte - carlo method to a finite - density system .",
    "there are a number of proposals to tame this problem  @xcite , among which the taylor expansion in terms of @xmath3 seems to work well insofar as @xmath3 is under the radius of convergence  @xcite . in this way",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) at finite @xmath2 and @xmath1 is partially available from the direct lattice qcd simulation .",
    "actually the eos is an indispensable input for the sake of the hydrodynamic evolution of matter . from the @xmath4-constant line , where @xmath5 is the entropy density and @xmath6 is the baryon number density",
    ", we can draw the isentropic trajectory along which the adiabatic system evolves  @xcite .",
    "an interesting progress has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the isentropic thermodynamics was investigated with a constraint that the strange quark density must be zero , i.e.  @xmath7 .",
    "such a constraint is necessary to emulate matter created by the ultra relativistic heavy - ion collisions because thermalization is achieved within the time scale of the strong interaction and the system is far from @xmath8-equilibration .    in this paper",
    "we will utilize the nambu  jona - lasinio model with the polyakov loop coupling ( pnjl model )  @xcite to reveal the isentropic thermodynamics with @xmath7 imposed .",
    "in contrast to the njl model study along the same line  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for another type of approach ) , the pnjl model has an advantage that a part of the gluon degrees of freedom is included , which gives us a hope that the pnjl model can lead to a better eos reflecting the gluodynamics as well as the chiral dynamics . in ref .",
    "@xcite we can already find the isentropic trajectory evaluated in the pnjl model and notice that they are qualitatively similar to the results in ref .",
    "we will see that the constraint @xmath7 causes only little change in the resultant isentropic trajectory because the strange quark mass @xmath9 is still substantially large around the crossover region and the strange density is suppressed in any case .",
    "the extension from the njl model to the pnjl model is not a minor improvement , however .",
    "our nontrivial finding is , in fact , that the pnjl model is capable of capturing the correct behavior of the induced strange quark chemical potential @xmath10 to keep @xmath7 . since the nonzero @xmath11 has its origin in confinement physics , as we will discuss later , the njl model without any confinement effect is of no use but the pnjl model naturally provides us with @xmath10 which is related to the ratio of the polyakov loop @xmath12 and the anti - polyakov loop @xmath13 . as a matter of fact , although it is known that @xmath12 deviates from @xmath13 at @xmath14  @xcite , our present work is the very first demonstration to show that this difference @xmath15 has a physical consequence in the best of our knowledge .",

    "the essential point is that we consider not the difference but the ratio , @xmath141 , which may take a huge value when @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "( or logarithm of the ratio between @xmath12 and @xmath48 ) on the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane.,width=340 ]    we plot the induced @xmath11 on the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane in fig .",

    "the functional shape is quite characteristic at small temperature .",
    "let us disclose the origin of this triangle - peak structure at low @xmath2 separating the @xmath1-region into three pieces :    \\i ) quark - regime  at small @xmath1 up to the peak position , the induced @xmath11 rises linearly along with @xmath1 . in this region",
    "the mesonic correlation is the governing dynamics as already explained above .",
    "\\ii ) diquark - regime  the turning point of @xmath1 where @xmath11 starts decreasing corresponds to the chemical potential with which the diquark excitation @xmath144 is energetically more favorable than the quark excitation @xmath145 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mus ] ) we can derive the condition @xmath146 for the diquark excitation overcoming the quark excitation .",
    "since the constituent quark mass is @xmath147 in this model , the threshold should be @xmath148 .",
    "this estimate is really consistent with our numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_ratio ] . in this @xmath1-region @xmath11 decreases because diquarks behave like anti - quarks in color space .",
    "in other words the mesonic ( quark  anti - quark ) correlation is taken over by the baryonic ( quark  diquark ) correlation which carries nonzero baryon number and so @xmath11 is partially canceled by this effect .",
    "\\iii ) baryonic - regime  if @xmath1 is greater than @xmath149 the color singlet contribution , @xmath150 , is dominant , which is interpreted as the baryonic excitation . in this regime",
    "the polyakov loop is decoupled from the dynamics and there is no confinement effect , even though the polyakov loop is zero .",
    "( such a state is recently named the `` quarkyonic phase ''  @xcite . )",
    "then @xmath126 suffices for @xmath7 .",
    "we have calculated the isentropic trajectories on the phase diagram in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane using the pnjl model .",
    "our results are quantitatively consistent with the lattice results in the high-@xmath2 and low-@xmath1 region where the lattice data is available by means of the taylor expansion .    to test whether the taylor expansion is under theoretical control or",
    "not , we have expanded our numerical results of the entropy @xmath5 and the baryon density @xmath6 into polynomial series in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "we have confirmed that the taylor expansion can access the trajectories for @xmath68 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , but can not for @xmath108 at which the isentropic thermodynamics differs substantially from that at zero density .",
    "we have also realized that @xmath84 has pathological behavior if expanded at high temperature , which can be cure by the pad approximation .",
    "finally we have discussed the induced strange quark chemical potential @xmath11 to keep @xmath7 in the system ruled by the strong interaction .",
    "we have found the interesting relation between @xmath11 and the ratio of the polyakov loop @xmath12 and the anti - polyakov loop @xmath13 .",
    "this prediction could be confirmed in the lattice qcd simulation .    in this work we neglected the effect of the soft - mode fluctuations around the critical point .",
    "this is one important direction of the future extension .",
    "another interesting direction is the origin of the poor convergence in the expansion of @xmath84 .",
    "this is not fully understood in the present work ; other thermodynamic quantities like @xmath83 have a smooth expansion but only @xmath84 fails",
    ". it would be also interesting , if the baryon number susceptibility does not have such a problem of expansion ( we guess so ) , to validate the idea that the qcd critical point is to be deduced from the radius of convergence using the model .",
