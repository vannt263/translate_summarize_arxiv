    "based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics , quantum protocols can increase the security of communication channels @xcite .",
    "quantum - based communication systems using optical fibers are already commercially available .",
    "however , one faces the disadvantages of limited flexibility concerning the positions of sender and receiver , bounding the distances to @xmath0100  km , due to losses @xcite .",
    "an alternative consists in atmospheric free - space channels . in past years",
    ", it has been demonstrated that quantum communication is possible through free - space links @xcite and even via orbiting satellites @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility to establish a global quantum communication network .    beside many experimental demonstrations in discrete variables",
    "@xcite , a different approach is the continuous - variable quantum key distribution ( cv - qkd ) @xcite .",
    "the latter works even in the presence of bright day light @xcite . however , the standard cv - qkd protocols require further improvements , as current methods only support rather limited communication distances @xcite .",
    "the generation of gaussian entangled states is nowadays quite advanced and , thus , they serve as the main class of states for improving cv - qkd @xcite .",
    "gaussian states are fully characterized by the covariance matrix of their field quadratures or , equivalently , of their complex field amplitudes .",

    "the description of the quantum properties of light after transmission through the turbulent atmosphere requires a quantum theory of atmospheric fading channels with fluctuating losses @xcite .",
    "such channels are characterized by a probability distribution of transmission ( pdt ) .",
    "the derivation of the pdt relies on detailed knowledge of the atmospheric properties , such as the propagation distance , the weather , and the daytime conditions .",
    "it requires one to unify the knowledge on classical atmospheric optics  @xcite with quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "for gaussian quantum light , one usually measures the field quadratures with balanced homodyne detection .",
    "this technique has been adapted for fading atmospheric channels @xcite by propagating the signal and the reference field , i.e. , the local oscillator , in orthogonal polarization modes . some scenarios with gaussian entanglement in the atmosphere",
    "have been studied @xcite , but a full analysis of the evolution of bipartite gaussian entanglement in arbitrary free - space links is missing yet . such a complete analysis would allow one to optimize the transmitted entanglement , e.g. , for ensuring a maximal security of cv - qkd protocols .",
    "the treatment of secure data transfer through atmospheric channels needs interdisciplinary research , combining the fields of classical atmospheric optics , quantum optics , and quantum information theory .    in this contribution",
    ", we aim at a full study of the transmission of bipartite gaussian entanglement through the turbulent atmosphere . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce input - output relations for the simon entanglement criterion .",
    "we consider two fundamentally different cases .",
    "the first one is the case of uncorrelated fading channels where both modes are subjected to independent losses , e.g. , due to propagation in different directions .",
    "the second one is the case of correlated fading channels .",
    "based on adaptive methods , we show that any channel can attain this correlated form , which results in entanglement preserving links .",
    "a remarkable consequence of our analysis is a dependence of the gaussian entanglement on the local coherent displacements of the input fields .",
    "an adjustment of these parameters allows one to optimize gaussian entanglement transfer through the turbulent atmosphere .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ch : general ] , we derive the output covariance matrix and the corresponding entanglement test for the transmission of bipartite gaussian entanglement trough turbulent channels .",
    "we focus on the effects of uncorrelated atmospheric losses in sec .",
    "[ ch : uncorrelated ] . in sec .",
    "[ ch : adaptive ] , we introduce an adaptive method to correlate the channels and discuss the gaussian entanglement in this case .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ ch : summary ] .",
    "gaussian states are completely described by the first- and second - order moments of their field quadratures or , equivalently , bosonic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the simon entanglement criterion @xcite in the form of ref .",
    "@xcite states that any two - mode gaussian state is entangled if and only if @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the partial transposition of the matrix @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the second - order matrix in bosonic creation and annihilation operators , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 denoting the annihilation operators of the two field modes and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "the matrix @xmath4 can be given in a block form with @xmath9 blocks @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related to the single - mode covariances and @xmath12 describes the correlations between the modes .",
    "the description with bosonic field - mode operators can always be rewritten in terms of quadratures via a linear transformation .",
    "note that the simon criterion  eq .",
    "is an entanglement test which indicates entanglement .",
    "however , it is not aimed at quantifying the amount of entanglement . for a quantification of gaussian entanglement",
    ", one needs to employ entanglement measures ( monotones ) ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will introduce the treatment of atmospheric fading channels .",
    "the theoretical description of a general two - mode quantum state after transmission through fading channels is a bipartite generalization of the theory established in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this context , the elements of matrix  ( [ eq : simonmatrix ] ) can be expressed in terms of normally ordered moments , @xmath13 here , @xmath14 are the field moments of the state and @xmath15 denote the moments after propagating the state through the turbulent atmosphere . moreover , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the amplitude transmission coefficients of the two field modes which are fluctuating according to the joint pdt , @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 due to the negligibly small depolarization effects of the atmosphere @xcite and no dephasing between different polarizations @xcite , the transmission coefficients can be considered as real random variables @xcite .",
    "in contrast to fading channels with fluctuating loss , deterministic loss channels are characterized by a deterministic pdt , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the constant loss in the subsystem @xmath22 .",
    "for example , deterministic losses may properly describe the attenuation in optical fibers .",
    "the above description of fading losses is general and applies to all passive polarization - preserving turbulent loss media . however , in order to give some realistic examples in the further course of this work , we will shortly comment on existing models of different atmospheric loss regimes which show good agreement with experimental data . in the case of weak turbulence ,",
    "the leading effect is beam wandering , which describes the wandering of the beam spot at the receiver aperture plane due to atmospheric turbulence . for this effect",
    ", a pdt model has been derived @xcite , which agrees well with experiments with a propagation distance of @xmath23 km  @xcite .",
    "recently , the approach was generalized for including elliptic beam - shape deformation effects @xcite .",
    "this model even applies to conditions of strong turbulence .",
    "the derived pdt behaves similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite for a @xmath24 km free - space link .",
    "these examples show that the propagation distance is one of the relevant parameters controlling the transition from weak to strong turbulence .    after passing through turbulent channels ,",
    "the quantum state of light is , in general , not gaussian anymore .",
    "the simon criterion is solely based on moments of second order .",
    "hence , it yields a complete entanglement characterization of bipartite gaussian states . for non - gaussian states",
    ", it still certifies the entanglement inherent in the second moments , denoted as the gaussian part of entanglement .",
    "however , it can not identify entanglement effects related to higher - order correlations .",
    "let us formulate the input - output relations , which connect matrix   at the source with that at the receivers .",
    "for technical details , we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric output matrix reads @xmath25 in the following , we discuss this result in detail including the notations and the used symbols .",
    "the effect of a deterministic loss , @xmath21 , is represented by the attenuated matrix @xmath26 , which has been extensively studied @xcite . here",
    ", we have @xmath27 .",
    "the atmospheric matrix @xmath28 is further characterized by the two correlation coefficients @xmath29 it is easy to see that @xmath30 $ ] @xcite . the @xmath31 index in the matrix @xmath32 [ cf .",
    ".  ] indicates that the correlations between the two modes are diminished by a factor @xmath33 .",
    "that is , the correlation block in eq .",
    "maps as @xmath34 . moreover , the second term in eq .",
    "depends on the vectors of local displacement @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that these vectors are scaled with the atmospheric fluctuations of the transmission coefficients .",
    "hence , fading channels lead to a strict dependence of the entanglement certification on the coherent amplitudes , unlike in the case of deterministic attenuation ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "again , the off - diagonal ( intermode ) part of the displacement contribution in eq .   is scaled with a correlation coefficient , @xmath38 .",
    "thus , major channel characteristics are determined by the two correlation parameters @xmath31 and @xmath38 , which will be studied for different scenarios later on .    the corresponding entanglement criterion , @xmath39 ,",
    "is calculated by inserting the partial transposition of @xmath28 in eq .   into eq .  .",
    "this results in  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the well - known deterministic loss contribution and with a displacement vector @xmath42 ( @xmath43 indicates the perpendicular vector to @xmath44 ) . additionally , we have the terms @xmath45 where @xmath46 ( for @xmath47 ) denotes the @xmath48 blocks of @xmath49 [ cf",
    ". eqs .   and  ] after partial transposition , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , as well as @xmath52 .",
    "let us analyze the structure of eq .  .",
    "the first two terms represent the decrease of the correlation between the two modes by the factor @xmath33 in turbulent loss channels [ see eqs .   and  ]",
    "where @xmath53 .",
    "the last two terms in eq .  , being related to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , show the dependency of the simon entanglement test on coherent displacements , which is an important finding for turbulent loss channels . in particular , the contribution including @xmath56 can be negative for @xmath57 with proper choices of displacement vectors",
    "this leads to the fact that the entanglement transfer can be optimized , as we will discuss in the continuation of this work .",
    "note that , in the case of deterministic attenuation , i.e. , @xmath58 , this criterion reduces to the case of deterministic attenuation which always preserves gaussian entanglement @xcite .",
    "equations   and   represent the most general form of the input - output relation for the gaussian entanglement test in atmospheric links .",
    "after this full treatment , we continue our analysis with the case of uncorrelated channels , with @xmath59 . thus , we have for the correlation parameters in eq .  : @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "a natural example is the case of counterpropagation , i.e. , both modes propagate in different directions through the atmosphere .",
    "the case in which one mode undergoes only a deterministic loss is also included .",
    "an example is a scenario where entanglement is established between the sender , who locally keeps one mode in a fiber loop , and a remote receiver of the other mode , connected via a free - space link @xcite .",
    "let us assume zero coherent displacements , @xmath62 .",
    "then , the entanglement test   reduces to @xmath63 the first term resembles the deterministic loss scaled by the atmospheric coefficient @xmath64 [ cf .",
    "the second term is clearly positive , as @xmath53 . with decreasing @xmath31 ,",
    "the absolute value of the negative first term becomes smaller , while the positive second term increases .",
    "consequently , the gaussian entanglement part vanishes , as @xmath65 becomes positive .",
    "is shown for a tmsv state for two uncorrelated atmospheric channels with channel characteristics obtained from experiments .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to a 144-km - long channel with @xmath66 , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) and to a 1.6-km - long channel with @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath72 is scaled by @xmath73 for the solid line .",
    "surprisingly , if @xmath74 exceeds a certain value no gaussian entanglement persists . ]",
    "a surprising effect can be observed when we consider the propagation of a two - mode squeezed - vacuum ( tmsv ) state through uncorrelated atmospheric channels ; @xmath75 with squeezing parameter @xmath76 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmsv ] , we see that the increase of squeezing can frustrate the transfer of gaussian entanglement through atmospheric links .",
    "thus , too strong squeezing might be hindering in turbulent loss channels .",
    "consequently , an optimal squeezing interval can be identified .",
    "let us stress that this statement has to be understood in terms of the significance of verified entanglement , which yields an operational quantification of the entanglement transferred through the atmosphere in the sense of its significance .",
    "we examine the initial partially transposed matrix @xmath77 of the tmsv state .",
    "all blocks of @xmath77 have a diagonal form , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . with increasing @xmath74 ,",
    "all nonzero entries of @xmath77 become approximately @xmath80 .",
    "however , the turbulence reduces the correlations @xmath81 by the factor @xmath31 . as these correlations are responsible for the entanglement this reduction eventually yields @xmath82 .",
    "a more intuitive way to understand this effect can be given by considering the squeezing ellipses .",
    "a tmsv state appears to show squeezing in the joint position and momentum basis of the two modes , respectively .",
    "the stronger the squeezing the more pronounced are these ellipses . uncorrelated turbulent losses cause different fluctuations in both modes which leads to rotational blurring of the original squeezing ellipses around the origins . for stronger squeezing this smearing effect",
    "is more grave as the antisqueezed parts of the ellipses fluctuate more intensively .",
    "this leads to the fact that tmsv states with stronger squeezing may disentangle faster in uncorrelated turbulent loss channels .",
    "in particular , the smaller @xmath31 is , the smaller is the squeezing interval for which gaussian entanglement survives ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : tmsv ] ) .    in order to exemplarily demonstrate the capability of our approach to describe real atmospheric channels , we use measured experimental transmission characteristics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmsv ] we apply turbulent loss parameters obtained from two experiments which correspond to a rather long and a short transmission channel : the first one for a 144-km - long free - space link between two canary islands @xcite and the second one for a 1.6-km - long atmospheric channel @xcite . for the former , we used a pdt model which resembles the log - normal distribution @xcite , the latter is described by the dominant effect of beam wandering @xcite .",
    "both pdt models are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data @xcite , which demonstrates the applicability for different atmospheric conditions .",
    "now , we will consider the surprising effect of coherent displacements on the simon test for uncorrelated fading channels .",
    "as @xmath61 , we see that the second term in eq .   only adds a positive part to the single - mode blocks of the matrix @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath11 get the additional summands @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , and @xmath12 has no additional displacement dependent term . in terms of the test in eq .",
    ", this means that the last term is positive and increases with the local displacements . as a consequence ,",
    "gaussian entanglement vanishes with increasing the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 . here , a similar argument , as given above for the frustration of entanglement transfer by strong squeezing ,",
    "can be employed to give the reader a more intuitive explanation of this behavior .",
    "we already mentioned that uncorrelated turbulent losses lead to rotational blurring in the phase space which is more pronounced the further the state is displaced from the origin .",
    "consequently , one can directly understand why coherent displacements are disadvantageous in such environments .",
    "hence , coherent displacements should be avoided to preserve entanglement in uncorrelated atmospheric channels . however , for certain scenarios , such as cv - qkd protocols , one employs coherent displacement ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in such cases",
    ", one may optimize the displacements to conserve the entanglement .",
    ", are displayed as a function of the coherent displacement @xmath87 .",
    "the circle and the ellipse correspond to the displaced symmetric and asymmetric tmsv states with squeezing parameter @xmath88 .",
    "the interior ( exterior ) regions satisfy @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the channel parameters are @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) . ]",
    "an example of the displacement dependence in phase space is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropy ] .",
    "we study an asymmetric tmsv state , which can be generated by mixing two equally squeezed , single - mode states on a beam splitter with transmission coefficient of @xmath93 and a consecutive displacement in one mode , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the standard tmsv state is obtained with a @xmath96 beam splitter ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the here considered asymmetry of the input state leads to larger values of @xmath87 in some directions of the phase space for which the entanglement is still preserved .",
    "we proceed with our analysis to characterize the case of fully correlated channels , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "thus , we get the maximal values @xmath99 [ see eq .  ] which reduces eq .   to @xmath100 completely correlated fading channels can be established in the case of copropagation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , this ideal correlation can be produced in other kinds of communication channels by artificially monitoring and adapting the channel transmissivities . in detail , ( i ) one has to measure the transmission coefficients in both channels , ( ii ) share this information via classical communication , and ( iii ) attenuate the channel with the higher transmissivity to the level of the lower one .",
    "the online monitoring of the turbulence can be performed with the copropagating local oscillator beam @xcite . as long as the classical communication time",
    "does not exceed the coherence time of the atmosphere such an approach is feasible .",
    "the joint pdt of our adaptive scheme @xmath101 can be obtained straightforwardly from the initial distribution @xmath102 [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] by mapping the random variables @xmath103  @xcite , @xmath104\\!\\!.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , applying the proposed steps of this protocol , the fading channels become perfectly correlated , as @xmath105 results in @xmath106 .    at first glance",
    "it might seem counterintuitive that an additional attenuation improves the entanglement transfer .",
    "however , we will see that this is the case due to the resulting correlation . in the absence of coherent",
    "shifting , @xmath107 , we see that the simon test for perfectly correlated channels in eq .  , reduces to the exact form of deterministic attenuations .",
    "because such a deterministic loss always preserves gaussian entanglement @xcite , this also holds true for any gaussian entangled state with @xmath108 and @xmath109 propagating in the atmosphere and by applying our adaptive protocol .",
    "this is an important finding , as it shows that there is no trade - off due to artificial attenuation by using the adaptive scheme , as long as @xmath110 .",
    "the additional attenuation , due to the integration in eq .",
    ", is worthwhile , as the introduced correlation between the modes ( @xmath106 ) assures the survival of gaussian entanglement .",
    "the influence of the turbulence occurs when we consider coherent displacement which results in a non - zero second term @xmath111 [ see eq .  ] .",
    "notably , this term is not necessarily positive ( see previous discussion of uncorrelated channels ) , and is a genuine effect of turbulent loss channels which differs from deterministic loss scenarios .",
    "hence , an optimal choice of coherent shifting can ensure the entanglement transfer in the atmosphere , especially for cv - qkd applications , as we discussed before .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : coshift ] the entanglement test for a displaced tmsv state in a correlated fading channel ( @xmath105 ) is shown for two different atmospheric characteristics .",
    "the state has a fixed , joint displacement amplitude @xmath112 .",
    "the dependency on @xmath113 and the sum of the phases of the coherent amplitudes @xmath114 , with @xmath115 and @xmath116 , is depicted .",
    "if gaussian entanglement persists , it strictly depends on the choice of phase of the coherent shifting .",
    "in particular @xmath117 and @xmath118 lead to the worst and the optimal case , respectively .",
    "additionally , the sensitivity to the channel characteristics @xmath119 and @xmath120 can be seen by comparing the two cases .",
    "however , there also exists the entanglement - persisting region , which does not depend on the channel characteristics  @xcite .",
    "we have introduced input - output relations for the entanglement of bipartite gaussian states propagated through the turbulent atmosphere . in particular ,",
    "our rigorous studies demonstrate that the gaussian entanglement preservation strongly depends on the initial coherent amplitudes , which is not the case for standard gaussian channels .",
    "moreover , we show that optimal and finite squeezing levels exist that are preferable for fading quantum communication links .",
    "our findings open up new perspectives for optimal cv - qkd protocols in free - space links which employ entangled gaussian states and encode information via coherent displacements .    for uncorrelated fading channels , one can choose the displacement to increase the range of distributed gaussian entanglement by steering the input state with passive optical elements .",
    "in addition , we proposed an adaptive technique which , by monitoring and controlling the channel transmittance , can correlate the atmospheric channel characteristics . in this manner ,",
    "gaussian entanglement is always preserved .",
    "therefore , this approach renders it possible to distribute gaussian entanglement between arbitrary points on earth and orbiting satellites via atmospheric links .",
    "we believe that our rigorous studies and proposed methods will find a number of applications for atmospheric continuous - variable entanglement transfer , global quantum - communication networks , and in - lab experiments to improve observable properties of gaussian entanglement in turbulent media .",
    "an extension of our treatment to non - gaussian entanglement certifiers might further improve the entanglement detection and the related applications in free - space channels .",
