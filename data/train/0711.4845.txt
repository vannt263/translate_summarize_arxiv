    "the so - called `` lyman - break '' technique ( steidel & hamilton 1992 ) is now widely used to select galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "this method relies on multi - band imaging to identify the characteristic discontinuity  the _ lyman - break _  in the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of high - redshift galaxies , which is largely caused by the lyman - limit and @xmath2 absorptions of intervening neutral hydrogen along the sightlines to such galaxies ( e.g. , madau 1995 ) .",
    "the technique requires imaging in at least two passbands , one to the blue side of the break and the other to the red side .",
    "lyman - break makes high - redshift galaxies much fainter in the blue band than in the red one , or in other words , it makes them seem to `` drop - out '' from the blue band .",
    "for this reason , this method is also known as the `` drop - out '' selection , and the candidates found in this way are usually referred to as `` dropouts '' .    as its first application in the @xmath1 regime , yan , windhorst & cohen ( 2003 ; hereafter ywc03 ) used this technique in a deep field observed by the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; ford et al .",
    "2003 ) in the default pure parallel mode ( sparks et al .",
    "2001 ) soon after its deployment on - board the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) . in this redshift range ,",
    "lyman - break occurs at around 8512 in observer s frame ( restframe 1216 ) , which is well targeted by the f775w and f850lp filters through which this deep parallel field was imaged .",
    "ywc03 found a large number of f775w - band dropouts , and argued that the vast majority of them were very likely galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "the number density of @xmath1 galaxies inferred from ywc03 , however , seem to be much higher than those in other deep acs fields ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2003 ; stanway , bunker & mcmahon 2003 ; dickinson et al . 2004 ; bouwens et al . 2004 ; bunker et al .",
    "2004 ; yan & windhorst 2004 , hereafter yw04 ) . while the cosmic variance could result in significant fluctuation in the number density ( e.g. , somerville et al .",
    "2004 ; bouwens et al . 2004 ) , it can not account for the large difference between the result of ywc03 and those of others .",
    "as the true number density of galaxies at @xmath1 is closely related to a series of important cosmological questions ( e.g. , the formation of early galaxies ; the reionization history of the universe ; etc . ) , it is prudent to closely examine the cause of the observed difference .    in this paper",
    ", we present new results that shed light to the nature of this overdensity .",
    "we first describe the existing and new _ hst _ observations in  2 and the data reduction in  3 .",
    "the overdensity of f775w - band dropouts in ywc03 is scrutinized in  4 , and a new interpretation is given in  5 .",
    "we conclude with a summary in  6 . for simplicity , we refer to the _ hst _ f475w , f775w , f850lp , f110w , and f160w passbands as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the f775w - band dropouts are then referred to as @xmath0-dropouts .",
    "the magnitudes are in ab system .",
    "all coordinates quoted are in j2000 .",
    "the following cosmological parameters from the first - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) results in spergal et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are adopted : @xmath8 . using the three - year wmap results ( spergal et al .",
    "2007 ) would not change any of our results .",
    "in addition to the acs parallel field discussed in ywc03 ( hereafter referred to as `` par1 '' ) , we have acquired two sets of new observations to help tackle the question at hand .",
    "to follow - up a subset of the @xmath0-dropouts found in ywc03 , two regions in par1 were imaged by the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) camera 3 ( nic3 ) . during",
    "the course of these nic3 observations , the acs instrument was working in parallel , which resulted in a new acs parallel field ( hereafter referred to as `` par2 '' ) that is several arcminutes away from the original one .",
    "the layout of these two acs fields are show in fig .",
    "1 . note that they are in the general direction of the virgo cluster .",
    "we describe all these observations below .",
    "the center of par1 is at @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the acs data were taken during _ hst _",
    "cycle 11 soon after the instrument was installed in march , 2002 .",
    "in fact , the observations spanned from april 28 to june 19 , 2002 , and were acquired during the execution of the guest observer ( go ) program i d 9043 ( pi .",
    "tonry ) , when it was using the wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) as the primary instrument to image ngc4647 , which is a member of the virgo cluster . only @xmath4 and @xmath5 filters were used for these acs parallels . in total ,",
    "15 images were taken in @xmath4 and 27 images were taken in @xmath5 . the total exposure time in these two bands is 2.65 hours and 4.28 hours , respectively .",
    "our nic3 observations of par1 were carried out as a go program ( pid 9780 ) in _ hst _ cycle-12 .",
    "two regions in par1 , designated as fields `` sub1 '' and `` sub2 '' , were observed in @xmath6 and @xmath7 . due to an unfortunate system glitch that caused nicmos",
    "enter a short safing - mode period in early august 2003 , our program missed its originally planned visit windows , and its execution had to stretch from january to december 2004 through rescheduled visits .    for each field ,",
    "the observations were done at 15 dithering positions in @xmath6 and 25 positions in @xmath7 .",
    "the observation mode was multiaccum with spars64 sequence .",
    "the exposure time at each dithering position is 512 seconds , resulting in a total integration time of 2.13 hours in @xmath6 and 3.56 hours in @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "while our nic3 program was not executed in august 2003 as originally scheduled , part of its acs parallel observations were still automatically carried out on august 5 and 6 , 2003 as planned in default .",
    "this resulted in par2 , which is about 8@xmath11 to the north of par1 .",
    "the field center is @xmath12 , @xmath13 . in total , 5 images in @xmath5 , 12 images in @xmath4 and 6 images in @xmath3 were taken in this field , giving a net exposure time of 1.00 , 1.80 and 0.89 hours in these three bands , respectively .",
    "in this section , we discuss the data reduction and photometry of all relevant _ hst _ images .      when the ywc03 paper was written ( september 2002 ) , the hst `` on - the - fly reprocessing '' ( otfr ) calibration pipeline could only process acs data up to the step of geometric distortion correction .",
    "the _ multidrizzle _ package ( koekemoer et al . 2002 ) , now a standard tool for mosaicing acs images using the drizzle algorithm ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) , was then not yet well known and tested .",
    "therefore , the acs mosaics of par1 used in ywc03 were created by stacking the flat - fielded , distortion - corrected images utilizing the well - tested _ imcombine _ task of iraf that had been used by the community for decades .    for this current study ,",
    "the acs data of par1 were retrieved again from the _ hst _ data archive . in so doing",
    ", the requested data were automatically reprocessed by the otfr pipeline using the best reference files ( bias , dark current , flat field , etc . )",
    "currently available .",
    "new mosaics were then made from these reprocessed images by using the now - fully - matured _ multidrizzle _ routine as available in stsdas under pyraf .",
    "the reduction of the par2 acs data followed the same procedure .",
    "some acs / wfc otfr - processed images are known to show a quadrant - to - quadrant `` jump '' in background because of the varing residual bias levels in the four acs / wfc readout amplifiers ( pavlovsky et al .",
    "while this bias offset is minimal in the data of par2 ( @xmath14 level ) , it is obvious in most of the par1 images ( @xmath15 level ) .",
    "although such `` jumps '' do not have significant impact on the photometry of compact sources in general , they do affect the sources that are close to quadrant boundaries .",
    "therefore , before stacking the par1 data , such jumps were removed by subtracting the background from each quadrant using our home - grown routines .",
    "the quadrant offsets were reduced to @xmath16 level after this process .",
    "the final mosaics were created following the standard drizzling procedures implemented in _ multidrizzle _ , and were normalized to unit exposure time ( count per second ) .",
    "a square kernel was used in drizzling , and the linear size of drop was set to 0.9 ( the `` final_pixfrac '' parameter of _ multidrizzle _ ) . to get a finer spatial resolution ,",
    "the drizzle scale ( the `` final_scale '' parameter ) was set to 0.6 , which resulted in an output pixel scale of 0.03@xmath17/pixel . for each field , the output mosaics in different passbands were all registered to the same reference position in the process .",
    "the absolute astrometry of the final mosaics was calibrated by using the compact objects visible in the digital sky survey images .    in order to provide a reference frame for par1 nic3 data reduction , another version of par1 acs mosaics",
    "was also created by setting drizzle scale to 1.0 , i.e. , preserving the native pixel scale ( 0.05@xmath17/pixel ) of the acs / wfc .",
    "we will refer to these lower - resolution mosaics and the higher - resolution ones mentioned above as `` lowrs '' and `` highrs '' acs mosaics , respectively .",
    "they each serve different purposes in the analysis process .    as the original pixels were resampled during drizzling ( and during geometric distortion correction as well ) , the final mosaics all have correlated pixel noise . the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of a given object derived directly from the final mosaic would therefore be overestimated , and hence its photometric error would be underestimated .",
    "we used a routine , kindly provided to one of us ( hy ) by dr .",
    "mark dickinson , to calculate the correlation amplitude and hence to calculate proper statistical error associated with each pixel .",
    "the error map ( so - called `` rms '' map ) derived in this way are widely used , e.g. , in the data analysis of goods ( e.g. , dickinson et al . 2004 ) .",
    "all data obtained by nicmos show a number of persistent anomalies that can not currently be handled by the otfr pipeline .",
    "therefore , the otfr - processed nic3 data of sub1 and sub2 fetched from the archive were further reduced before stacking .",
    "an additional count - rate and wavelength dependent non - linearity of nicmos was recently identified by the stsci nicmos team ( nicmos instrument science reports 2006 - 001 , 002 and 003 ; see also http://www.stsci.edu/hst/nicmos/performance /anomalies / nonlinearity.html ) .",
    "this non - linearity was removed from the data by using the routine provided by the team .",
    "the quadrant bias of nicmos also has a stochastic behavior similar to what described above for acs . as a result , a bias - corrected nicmos image using the standard bias reference file usually show `` pedestals '' from quadrant to quadrant .",
    "such pedestals were removed by using the _ pesky _ task included in the stsdas package .",
    "all otfr - processed nic3 data have a persistent , additive pattern across entire field .",
    "this pattern is different in different passbands , but is rather stable with respect to time . to remove this pattern , a `` pattern image '' in each band",
    "was first created by stacking all the pedestal - corrected images in this band .",
    "the pattern image was then subtracted from each individual image .",
    "after all the above steps , the individual images were combined using the series of drizzle tasks included in the _ dither _ package of stsdas in iraf .",
    "each input science image was weighted by a weight image calculated from its associated error array stored in the [ err,2 ] extension of the otfr - processed image . for the purpose of matched - aperture photometry that will be discussed below ,",
    "the lowrs par1 acs @xmath5-band mosaic was binned in @xmath18 and then used as the reference .",
    "the nic3 images were all mapped ( i.e. , rotated and registered ) to this binned acs image during the drizzling process .",
    "the drizzle scale was set to 0.5 , which resulted in a final resolution of 0.10@xmath17/pixel , i.e. , the same as the binned lowrs acs image .",
    "the final mosaics were normalized to unit exposure time as well .",
    "the associated rms maps of all these nic3 mosaics were derived in the way similar to what described above for the acs mosaics .      as compared to the acs mosaics used in ywc03 ,",
    "the new mosaics created through the imporved reduction process ( see  3.1 ) are of much higher quality , and hence we can push to a significantly lower thresold for source detection .",
    "sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) was run on the highrs mosaics in dual - image mode to extract source catalogs for both par1 and par2 .",
    "`` mag_auto '' magnitudes were used to best approach the total magnitudes .",
    "a number of source catalogs were obtained for different purposes .",
    "the @xmath4-band and @xmath5-band mosaics were used alternatively as the detection images to perform `` matched - aperture photometry '' , i.e. , measuring the magnitudes of a given source in different bands through the same aperture defined by its appearance on the detection image .",
    "we will refer to these catalogs as `` @xmath4-based '' and `` @xmath5-based '' acs catalogs , respectively .",
    "source detection was performed at the threshold of 0.8  @xmath19 , using a @xmath20 gaussian filter with a full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 2.5 pixels .",
    "a minimum number of 4 connected pixels were required for a source to be included .",
    "as par1 was observed in parallel mode during the very early stage of acs , the data were all taken at a high gain setting of 4.0  @xmath21/adu , probably for safety reason ( i.e. , avoiding saturation ) . in order to make the zeropoints derived at a gain setting of 1.0  @xmath21/adu universally applicable ,",
    "the acs otfr pipeline multiplies the flat - field reference file by the gain of the object image before flat - field correction . in the end",
    ", an otfr - processed acs image always has an effective gain of 1.0  @xmath21/adu . when ywc03 was written , unfortunately , the authors were not aware of this  at that time poorly - documented  step in the otfr processing , and made a redundant correction for the gain by adding @xmath22 to the zeropoints . as a result , while the candidate selection in ywc03 remains valid , all magnitudes reported in that paper were too faint by 1.505 mag . this error has been reported in a footnote in yw04 .    in this current study ,",
    "the zeropoints published in the latest acs handbook were used ; namely , 26.068 , 25.654 and 24.862 mag for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . the 3  @xmath19 limits within a circular aperture of 0.1@xmath23 in radius are 29.1 and 28.3 mag in @xmath4 and @xmath5 in par1 , and 28.9 , 28.7 and 27.9 mag in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 in par2 , respectively .",
    "photometry of sub1 and sub2 nic3 mosaics in par1 was also done in dual - image mode , using @xmath6 and @xmath7 mosaics alternatively as the detection images .",
    "similarly , we will refer to these catalogs as `` @xmath6-based '' and `` @xmath7-based '' catalogs , respectively .",
    "the detection filter was a @xmath20 gaussian filter with a fwhm of 3 pixels , the detection threshold was set to 0.4  @xmath19 , and a minimum of 2 connecting pixels were required .",
    "again , mag_auto magnitudes were adopted . as the magnitude zeropoints provided by the otfr pipeline were no longer valid after the non - linearity correction described in  3.2",
    ", we followed the recipe given by the nicmos team to derive the zeropoints as 23.242 and 23.139 mag in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .    during this process , acs magnitudes of the nic3 sources",
    "were also extracted in order to properly measure their acs - to - nicmos colors for later analysis .",
    "as the nic3 mosaics were created by registering to the reference frame defined by the @xmath18 binned lowrs acs mosaics , matched - aperture photometry between nic3 and acs passbands was fairly straightforward .",
    "the detection images were still the nic3 mosaics , and the object images were @xmath18 binned acs mosaics that were convolved by the psf of the @xmath6 images ( derived using the tinytim tool ) .",
    "the binning operation was sum , which preserves the original acs magnitude zeropoints .",
    "using the newly produced acs mosaics of par1 , new nic3 data obtained at two pointings within par1 , and a new acs parallel field par2 for comparison , here we will re - examine the overdensity of @xmath0-dropouts in par1 reported by ywc03 .",
    "ywc03 reported 30 @xmath0-dropouts in par1 , whose @xmath5 magnitudes range from 26.8 to 28.3 mag . using the correct zeropoints ,",
    "their true @xmath5-band magnitude range should be 25.3 to 26.8 mag ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "the corresponding cumulative surface density thus is @xmath24 2.7 per arcmin@xmath25 to @xmath26 mag .",
    "taken at its face value , this number is 34 times higher than those in other deep , high galactic - latitude acs fields , including the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; beckwith et al .",
    "the @xmath0-dropouts in ywc03 were selected based on their invisibility in the @xmath4 image , i.e. , by selecting sources that have @xmath27 in @xmath5 but have @xmath28 in @xmath4 . as a result , about 2/3 of those objects have @xmath29 mag .",
    "other studies utilizing acs data ( including yw04 ) all have adopted less stringent selection criterion of @xmath30 mag or @xmath31 mag .",
    "therefore , the high surface density of ywc03 is even more difficult to be reconciled with all the other later work .    to study this problem in detail , here we reselect @xmath0-dropouts in par1 from the new @xmath5-based acs catalog as described in  3.3 .",
    "we only consider sources with @xmath27 in @xmath5 , and adopt the color criterion of @xmath30 mag for ease of comparison with other results .",
    "the candidates thus selected are visually examined to eliminate false detections such as residual cosmic rays and image defects .",
    "the final @xmath0-dropout sample consists of 356 objects to @xmath32 mag .",
    "this is much deeper than what we achived in ywc03 , and is the result of the much improved data quality . in particular , 198 of them have @xmath33 mag ( among which 21 have @xmath34 mag ) , which is a factor of 20 more than the @xmath0-dropouts selected in the hudf ( yw04 ; bunker et al .",
    "2004 ) to the same depth .",
    "this confirms  and reinforces  the unusually large overdensity of @xmath0-dropouts seen by ywc03 .",
    "the distribution of these @xmath0-dropouts in par1 are shown in fig .",
    "a necessary condition for an @xmath0-dropout being a legitimate candidate of galaxy at @xmath1 is that it must be a dropout in bluer bands . however , par1 does not have any data to the blue of @xmath4 . fortunately , as a subset of these @xmath0-dropouts have nic3 observations , we can use their acs - to - nic3 colors to judge whether they are consistent with being galaxies at @xmath1 .      in total , 21 @xmath0-dropouts are detected in our nic3 data .",
    "3 displays the image cut - outs of one such objects .",
    "the optical - to - ir color - color diagrams of all these sources are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "4 . for comparison , the right panel of fig . 4 shows the similar color - color diagrams from the hudf .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath0-dropouts in par1 reside in the similar regions in the optical - to - ir color space as the @xmath0-dropouts in the hudf . in particular , they are well separated from brown dwarf stars and e / s0 galaxies at lower redshifts , which are the most common contaminators to @xmath1 galaxy samples selected by the drop - out technique .      in order to compare with the results obtained in par1 , we perform @xmath0-dropout selection in par2 in a similar way .",
    "as this field has @xmath3 data , an additional constraint of non - detection in @xmath3 at 2  @xmath19 level is imposed for the selection .",
    "the final @xmath0-dropout sample consists of 20 objects to @xmath35 mag , which , while much less than the ones in par1 , is still a factor of @xmath36 more than those found in the hudf to the same depth ; in other words , the overdensity of @xmath0-dropouts also seems to present in par2 .",
    "the analysis in  4 indicates that the @xmath0-dropouts in par1 are consistent with being galaxies at @xmath1 , and that the overdensity is also present in par2 .",
    "if this interpretation is true , we will have to draw the conclusion that the overdensity of @xmath0-dropouts in this region is due to an extremely unusual concentration of @xmath1 galaxies over @xmath37  mpc scale . in this section , however , we present another possibility .",
    "the alternative interpretation is triggered by an unusual field population seen in both par1 and par2 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 , which shows the @xmath5 vs. @xmath4@xmath38@xmath5 color - magnitude diagrams in these fields using the @xmath5-based catalogs , together with the corresponding diagrams constructed in the hudf based on the photometry from yw04 .",
    "the left panel only plots the sources at @xmath39 , while the right panel includes all the sources at @xmath40 .",
    "a striking feature in this figure is the large concentration of objects at the faint end in the two parallel fields , which is not seen in the hudf ( and other deep acs fields ) . due to the shallower depth in par2 , this population is at the verge of being detectable at @xmath39 ; however , it gets very prominent if the threshold is lowered to @xmath40 .",
    "ywc03 noticed only a hint of this excess in par1 ; the source detection back then did not reach a sufficient depth that could unambiguously confirm its existence .",
    "this excess of faint field objects in par1 and par2 is present in all passbands . to quantify this excess , fig .",
    "6 compares the surface densities of the detected sources in these two fields and the ones in the hudf , derived at two different threshold levels of @xmath40 ( left panel ) and @xmath39 ( right panel ) .",
    "again , while the excess in par2 is only detectable when the sources of low @xmath41 are included , the excess in par1 is obvious even at a high source detection threshold .",
    "this excess starts at about 26.0 mag in both par1 and par2 , and extends to a much fainter level .",
    "in particular , the deep mosaics in par1 allow this excess to be traced to at least @xmath42 and 27.2 mag in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . to further ensure the existence of the excess",
    ", we split the available images of par1 into two groups and created shallower stacks in both bands .",
    "the same excess was detected as well .",
    "the @xmath0-dropout surface densities are also superposed in fig .",
    "we point out that the @xmath0-dropout excess in the two parallel fields resides in the region where the field population excess happens .",
    "this is further discussed later in the paper .",
    "what is the nature of this field population excess ?",
    "the answer probably lies in the proximity of par1 and par2 to the galaxy pair m60/ngc4647 , which is several arcminutes away to the south ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . extended diffuse emissions of different natures have been detected around some nearby galaxies , for example in ngc 5907 ( shang et al .",
    "1998 ; zheng et al . 1999 ) and in m31 ( e.g. , ferguson et al . 2002 ) . while there is no previous report in the literature",
    ", we speculate that such extended diffuse emission also exists around m60/ngc4647 , and propose that the excess population is due to the fact that we have resolved the diffuse light extending from this interacting pair .",
    "if we adopt an average distance of @xmath43  mpc to m60/ngc4647 ( from nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) , par1 and par2 are @xmath24 32 and 69  kpc away from the center of pair , respectively .",
    "therefore , what we have detected are most likely the halo stars of the two galaxies and/or the tidal `` debris '' repelled from this pair during the course of the interaction .    here",
    "we exam the property of this excess more closely .",
    "we only use par1 for this purpose , as the data in this field are much deeper than in par2 .",
    "7 plots the surface densities of @xmath39 sources in par1 as functions of magnitudes in @xmath4 ( left ) and @xmath5(right ) , and compares them with the results in the hudf .",
    "the insets show the net excess after subtracting the surface density calculated in the hudf . tab .",
    "1 lists the surface densities of the net excess as a function of magnitudes .    taken at face value , the net excess in par1 as shown in fig .",
    "7 has a total magnitude of 15.0 and 15.7 mag in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the average surface brightness from the net excess ( i.e. , spreading the total integrated light of the net excess over the entire field of par1 ) , on the other hand , is 26.6 and 27.2 mag / arcsec@xmath25 in @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "if this excess is isotropic with respect to m60/ngc4647 , the total magnitude integrated over an annulus 3.4@xmath44 in width ( i.e. , about the width of one acs field ) at the distance of par1 ( centering on the galaxy pair ) is 12.2 mag in @xmath4 and 12.9 mag in @xmath5 . for comparison ,",
    "the total flux of m60 in johnson i - band is 8.46 mag ( or 0.925  jy , i.e. , 8.98 mag in ab ) within 84@xmath23 aperture ( boroson , strom & strom 1983 ) .",
    "therefore , the total diffuse light within this annulus is about a few percent of the central galaxies .",
    "the net excess peaks at about 27.1 and 26.6 mag in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "if these objects are indeed at the distance of virgo cluster , these values correspond to absolute magnitudes of @xmath45 and @xmath46 mag , respectively , which are in the regime of giants / supergiants or low luminosity globular clusters .",
    "we shall point out that the excess that we detected relates more closely to m60/ngc4546 rather than to the virgo cluster in general .",
    "a supporting evidence comes from the spatial gradient of this excess , which decreases in amplitude when moving away from the pair .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "8 , which plots the spatial distribution of all @xmath39 sources at @xmath5@xmath47  mag detected in the @xmath5-based catalog of par1 .",
    "the gradient is obvious : there are more sources to the south , which is the direction where the galaxy pair lies .",
    "another piece of evidence is that the amplitude of this excess ( see fig .",
    "7 and tab .",
    "1 ) can not be attributed to the intracluster stellar populations of the virgo cluster alone .",
    "we only consider virgo s intracluster globular clusters ( igc ) and red giants ( irg ) , as they are the only two type of stellar objects that are within the luminosity range of the detected excess .",
    "the _ total _",

    "2003 ) and the symmetry of globular cluster luminosity function , is only @xmath493.0  arcmin@xmath50 ( for any reasonable color transformation from f814w to f775w ) , depending on the proximity to a member galaxy . on the other hand , the deep _ hst _ surveys of virgo s irg ( e.g. , ferguson , tanvir & von hippel 1998",
    "; durrell et al . 2002 ; williams et al .",
    "2007b ) show that their cumulative surface density to @xmath51 mag can be as high as @xmath52  arcmin@xmath50 ( again for any reasonable f814w to f775w transformation ) .",
    "however , this is still a factor of 56 lower than what shown in fig . 7 and tab",
    "we suggest that the @xmath0-dropout overdensity observed in par1 & par2 might be related to the field object overdensity in the same regions .",
    "the field object excess becomes significant at 26.0 mag in both bands , and extends to at least 28.2 mag in @xmath4 and 27.2 mag in @xmath5 in the deeper par1 images ( see the insets in fig .",
    "8) where the excess can be traced to a faint level at high confidence .",
    "the @xmath0-dropouts selected in these fields resides in the @xmath5 magnitude range that the field object excess spans ( fig .",
    "the spatial distribution of the @xmath0-dropouts also seems to follow the gradient that seen in the distribution of the excess field population ( see fig . 2 & 7 ) .",
    "this excess field population is also red in color . fig .",
    "9 shows the surface densities of the sources in the above mentioned magnitude ranges as a function of @xmath4@xmath38@xmath5 color . for comparison ,",
    "the surface densities of the hudf sources in the same magnitude ranges are also shown . the insets plot the net excess using the hudf result as the reference .",
    "the excess population peaks at @xmath4@xmath38@xmath5@xmath53 mag in the @xmath4 image , and peaks at @xmath4@xmath38@xmath5@xmath54 mag in the @xmath5 image . note that the distribution extends continuously beyond @xmath4@xmath38@xmath5@xmath55 mag , which is the regime where the @xmath0-dropouts are selected .",
    "if the @xmath0-dropouts are indeed some stellar objects related to m60/ngc4647 , what type of stars could they be ?",
    "thus far we have not yet been able to identify the satisfactory candidates . as fig .",
    "4 shows , brown dwarfs are not likely to contribute much to our @xmath0-dropout sample because their optical - to - ir colors are different .",
    "in addition , their luminosities are too low .",
    "the only possibility then left is dusty stellar population , for example , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "however , the optical - to - ir colors of agb stars are quite different from the @xmath0-dropouts as well .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "10 , where the synthesized colors of agb stars generated from the model spectra of lancon & mouhcine ( 2002 ) are superposed on the color - color diagrams of the @xmath0-dropouts in par1 .",
    "we should also point out that no external dust extinction to any known types of stars could produce such colors ; no know extinction law could create such a red color in @xmath56 and yet keep @xmath57 and @xmath58 colors around zero .",
    "the red , excess field objects that we have discovered here seem to have some connection to the so - called `` red halo phenomenon '' ( zackrisson et al .",
    "2006 ) , which referrs to the very red colors of the halos found around some galaxies ( e.g. , zibetti , white & brinkmann 2004 ; zibetti & ferguson 2004 ; taylor et al .",
    "such red halos can not be easily explained by standard stellar populations . the @xmath56 color shown in fig .",
    "9 quantitively agrees with that of the halo around an edge - on disk galaxy in the hudf reported by zibetti & ferguson ( 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , the excess field objects that we see might represent the first example where such red halos have been resolved , and the @xmath0-dropouts might be the most extreme sources among this population that is most difficult to explain .",
    "in this paper , we use new and existing _ hst _ data to closely examine the large overdensity of @xmath0-dropouts that ywc03 found in a deep acs parallel field .",
    "the new data include nic3 imaging of a subset of the @xmath0-dropouts , and a set of new acs parallel data in a nearby region obtained during the nic3 observations .",
    "we confirm that a factor of @xmath59 overdensity of @xmath0-dropouts does exist in the parallel field of ywc03 , and that the optical - to - ir colors of these objects are similar to those selected in other deep acs fields such as the hudf",
    ".    however , these @xmath0-dropouts might _ not _ be galaxies at @xmath1 as one would expect . during the course of our investigation",
    ", we have found a large excess of discrete sources in both the field of ywc03 and the new acs parallel field .",
    "this excess is most likely due to a stellar population that is related to m60/ngc4647 , an interacting galaxy pair in the virgo cluster , which lies several arcminutes to the south of the acs parallel fields . at the distance of the virgo cluster ,",
    "the acs parallel fields are several tens of kpc away from the galaxy pair , and hence the stellar objects are likely tidal `` debris '' expelled from the pair and/or distant halo stars belong to these two galaxies .",
    "both the spatial distribution and the amplitude of the excess indicate that it is a population related more closely to the galaxy pair rather than to the virgo s intracluster populations .",
    "the @xmath0-dropouts in the field of ywc03 are within the magnitude range where the field object excess occurs .",
    "their distribution also shows similar spatial gradient of the field object excess .",
    "most importantly , the field object excess is red in color , and the red wing of its color distribution extends well into the regime where the @xmath0-dropouts were selected . for these reasons , we believe these @xmath0-dropouts are part of the stellar objects that constitute the field object excess rather than galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , we should caution that we still can not completely rule out the possibility that these @xmath0-dropouts might indeed be @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "on one hand , we do not have any definite evidence against this interpretation . on the other hand ,",
    "we have not yet found a stellar population that can reasonably explain the colors of these @xmath0-dropouts . to unambiguously identify their nature , spectroscopic observations of these objects are in demand .",
    "as the brightest sources in our sample are brighter than 26.0 mag in @xmath5 , this might be feasible with the existing spectrographs at our current 810 m class telescopes .",
