    "the spectroscopic detection of the energetic supernova sn 2003dh coincident with grb 030329 ( hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ; stanek et al . 2003 ) has firmly established that - at least some - long grbs accompany the core collapse of massive stars , as it was first suggested by the spatial and temporal coincidence of grb 980425 and sn 1998bw ( galama et al .",
    "such spectroscopic signatures of supernovae ( snae ) associated with grbs have been detected in a handful of cases during the last years , e.g. grb 031203/sn 2003lw ( malesani et al .",
    "2004 ) , grb 021211/ sn 2002lt ( della valle et al .",
    "2003 ) , grb 050525a / sn 2005nc ( della valle et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the recent case of grb 060218/sn 2006aj ( campana et al .",
    "2006 , modjaz et al .",
    "the possibility that core - collapse snae are progenitors of grbs has been further supported by the detection of re - brightening in the late - time afterglow light curves , interpreted as a contribution of accompanying snae ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 , zeh et al .",
    "2004 , castro - tirado & gorosabel 1999 ) and the localizations of afterglows in star forming regions ( e.g. djorgovski et al .",
    "2001 , bloom et al .",
    "2002 , fynbo et al .",
    "2000 , fruchter et al . 1999 ,",
    "holland & hjorth 1999 ) .    indeed , the currently mostly favored scenario for the origin of long grbs involves the collapse of a massive wolf - rayet star endowed with rotation ( woosley 1993 , macfadyen & woosley 1999 , woosley & heger 2004 ) .",
    "recently , yoon & langer ( 2005 ) considered the evolution of massive , magnetized stars where rapid rotation induces an almost chemically homogeneous evolution , and found that the requirements of this collapsar model are satisfied if the metallicity is sufficiently small , namely less than @xmath14 ( see woosley & heger 2006 ; yoon et al .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the estimates of metallicities of long grb hosts , which yielded preferentially subsolar - down to @xmath15 - values ( e.g. gorosabel et al . 2005 ; chen et al .",
    "2005 ; starling et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "clearly this scenario has key implications not only on the physics of the event and on the evolution of massive stars at low metallicities , but also on the event rate and redshift distribution of long grbs compared with that of snae .",
    "the cosmological consequences of a metallicty threshold can be explored by considering an average cosmic metallicity evolution , as in the work by langer & norman ( 2006 ) . in the present paper",
    "we instead explore the effects of a metallicity threshold following the star formation and chemical evolution of individual galaxies .    in order to derive the rates of progenitors and the characteristics of their host galaxies at high redshift , the star formation history and the chemical evolution for a large range of galaxy mass and virialization redshift must be computed .",
    "baryon condensation in cold gas , stars and in a central massive black hole ( bh ) within galaxy dark matter ( dm ) halos is a quite complex outcome of a number of physical processes ( including shock waves , radiative and shock heating , viscosity , radiative cooling ; star formation , bh accretion , gas inflow and outflow ) largely affecting each other ( see granato et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ; de lucia et al .",
    "when treating these processes within a self - consistent cosmological framework of galaxy formation , most of the complexity is related to the different scales involved .    for the sake of definiteness , here we adopt as a reference the galaxy formation scenario developed by granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which consistently accounts for the coevolution of spheroidal galaxies and their nuclear activity and intrinsically follows in time the gas content , star formation rate ( sfr ) and metallicity evolution for each galaxy mass .",
    "this enables us to investigate in detail the effect of a metallicity threshold on the properties not only of the grb population , but also of their host galaxies .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in   2 we briefly review the conceptual issues of the adopted galaxy formation scenario and explain how the grb progenitor rate has been estimated .",
    "our results are presented in   3 . in   4",
    "we discuss our findings , by comparing them with observational results and with previous studies . in   5",
    "we summarize our conclusions . throughout the paper a flat cosmological model with matter density parameter @xmath16 and hubble constant @xmath17 km s@xmath3",
    "mpc@xmath3 is adopted .",
    "long grbs at high redshift ( @xmath18 ) have progenitors which formed at least @xmath19 gyr ago .",
    "their coeval stellar populations are as old as the populations of spheroidal galaxies and spiral bulges and older than the populations in present galaxy discs ( see renzini 2006 ) : thus high redshift long grbs trace the formation history of the oldest stellar populations .",
    "low redshift grbs conversely trace the star formation in small mass irregular / interacting galaxies with low sfr ( fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ; wainwright et al .",
    "since we focus on high-@xmath20 grbs , in the following we will neglect the contribution of star formation in discs of present - day spiral galaxies .",
    "we exploit the physical model elaborated by granato et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2004 ) , which follows the evolution of baryons within protogalactic spheroids taking into account the effects of the energy fed back to the intra - galactic gas by sn explosions and by accretion onto the nuclear supermassive bh ( see also de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ; croton et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the model envisages that during or soon after the formation of the host dm halo , the baryons falling into the newly created potential well are shock - heated to the virial temperature .",
    "the hot gas is ( moderately ) clumpy and cools fast especially in the denser central regions , yielding a strong burst of star formation .",
    "star formation also promotes the storage of the cooled gas into a reservoir around the central seed bh , eventually leading to accretion onto it ( see kawakatu & umemura 2002 ) .",
    "the ensuing sn explosions and the nuclear activity feed energy back to the baryons , and regulate the ongoing sfr and bh growth .",
    "these mutual energy feedbacks actually _ reverse _ the formation sequence of the baryonic component of galaxies compared to that of dm halos : the star formation and the buildup of central bhs are completed more rapidly in the more massive haloes , thus accounting for the phenomenon now commonly referred to as _ downsizing _",

    "2004 ) .    in appendix",
    "a we present a simplified version of basic equations of the model , which allow to derive analytical solutions for the time evolution of sfr , mass in stars and metallicity , the quantities relevant to this work .",
    "these analytical functions are very good approximations of the more complex system of equations numerically solved in granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ; see for details lapi et al .",
    "2006 and mao et al .",
    "because of their fundamental character , these equations catch the basic aspects of the physical processes ruling star formation in protogalaxies at high redshift .",
    "the adopted initial mass function ( imf ) is a double power - law with slope @xmath21 from @xmath22 to @xmath23 and @xmath24 from @xmath23 down to @xmath25 ( romano et al .",
    "2002 ) , which is quite similar to that proposed by chabrier ( 2005 ) .    in fig .  1 we present the results for dm halos virialized at @xmath26 and endowed with mass ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath28",
    "for masses @xmath29 the sfr increases almost linearly with galaxy age in the initial stages , and then it is suddenly halted by the energy feedback from the quasar after a few @xmath30 yr . on the contrary , for @xmath31",
    "it is first almost constant and then slowly declines due to gas exhaustion .",
    "in fact , for small masses the effect of snae feedback regulates the star formation , while the bh is rather small there and the sfr can proceed for a much longer time ( see eq .  [ 16 ] in shankar et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the mass cycled through stars at any time is easily obtained by integrating the sfr ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "note that the quantities plotted in fig .",
    "1 refer to redshift @xmath26 ; however , both sfr and mass in stars scale approximately as @xmath32 for a given halo mass .    from the figure it is apparent that the chemical enrichment of the cold gas component is very rapid ; e.g. with the adopted imf the gas attains @xmath33 and @xmath34 the solar abundance in about @xmath35 and @xmath36 yr respectively , almost independently of the halo mass and redshift .",
    "a salpeter imf yields timescales about twice as long .",
    "this rapid enrichment is due to the fast evolution and formation timescales ( @xmath37 , see appendix a ) for the massive stars ( greater than @xmath38 ) relative to the timescale for the infall of the diffuse medium with primordial composition , which dilutes the metallicity of the cold star - forming gas .",
    "this behavior shows that a possible change of the imf at metallicity lower than a threshold around @xmath39 ( see bromm et al .",
    "2001 ; schneider et al .",
    "2006 ) is not critical for the issue related to long grbs . in other words , if long grbs are associated with low metallicity environments , the quick enrichment implies that the most relevant epoch for grb progenitors comes soon after halo virialization .",
    "this galaxy formation model neglects spatial resolution and assumes instantaneous mixing , i.e. it averages both sfr and chemical composition over the entire mass of cold gas .",
    "we stress that the cold gas is only a small fraction of the overall baryons associated with the galaxy halo ( cf . appendix",
    "a ) , and thus the averaging concerns the mass / volume of the protogalaxy wherein star formation is occurring and not the overall dm halo mass / volume . on the other hand , metallicity gradients have been observed in local spheroidal galaxies , @xmath40/\\delta \\log r \\approx -0.25 $ ] ( e.g. annibali et al .",
    "2007 , sanchez - blanquez et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this implies variations of about a factor two in metal abundance within a radius enclosing most of the galaxy mass .",

    "it is plausible that the core - collapse , believed to give rise to the formation of a bh and a grb event , is related to the final phases of the evolution of stars with masses greater than @xmath60 and with rapidly rotating cores ( yoon & langer 2005 ; woosley & heger 2006 ; yoon et al .",

    "a major issue in this respect is the large mass loss , that would entail also large angular momentum loss .",

    "though observations are still scanty in supporting this expectation , we will consider low metallicity and high rotation velocity as necessary and sufficient conditions for a massive star to be considered as a grb progenitor .",

    "we can conclude that grb hosts should well reproduce the lbg lf at its faint and bright ends .",
    "similar conclusions hold for lae lf .",
    "the shortness of @xmath160 myr implies that the hosts must exhibit quite large [ @xmath1/fe ] enhancement .",
    "in fact , the cumulative fraction of snia explosions after an instantaneous burst of star formation ( @xmath117 at @xmath161 gyr ) is negligibly small for @xmath162 myr ( corresponding to the lifetime of a @xmath163 star ) , for a wide class of progenitor models , i.e. single degenerates ( sd ) , and double degenerates ( dd ) exploders ( greggio 2005 ) . at @xmath120 gyr it reaches @xmath126 per cent in the most favorable case of close dd scheme .",
    "furthermore , the typical timescales required to significantly decrease the [ @xmath1/fe ] ratio from its initial value produced by a single generation of massive stars ( approximately @xmath164 depending on metallicity , imf and stellar yields , gibson et al .",
    "2003 ) , is @xmath165 , @xmath117 and @xmath127 gyr , for close dd , sd and wide dd progenitors , respectively .",
    "thus while in the most massive ellipticals the duration of the burst of star formation ( around @xmath165 gyr ) may be enough for a mild pollution by fe - peak elements ( depending on the assumed scenario for snia progenitors ) , the lower timescale required to reach the critical metallicity implies that grb hosts should display the original pattern of heavy elements produced by massive star chemical evolution .",
    "notice that the subsequent history of star formation decreases the initial @xmath1-enhancement more in smaller than in larger objects ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we conclude that at high redshift , grb hosts ( and the similarly young laes ) exhibit the highest values of @xmath1-enhancement , even higher than those of high-@xmath20 quasar hosts and of their descendents , the massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "finally , we can also estimate the distribution of intrinsic sfrs .",
    "it is worth stressing that generally the hosts with sfrs exceeding a few @xmath166 yr@xmath3 are significantly less than the overall galaxy population .",
    "this suppression reflects not only the steep halo mass function , but also the short duty cycle of grb hosts following the rapid metal enrichment in the initial stages of star formation . and again the effect gets more pronounced at decreasing @xmath20 due to the increased fraction of observable hosts which are below threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "the model allows for the existence of grb hosts with sfrs exceeding a few @xmath167 yr @xmath3 within halos endowed with @xmath168 : as shown in fig .  1 and fig .  8 , the fraction of these hosts should amount to a few per cent of the total",
    "nevertheless they should not have formed a large amount of stars @xmath169 , exhibit specific sfr @xmath170 yr@xmath3 and should be rather extincted by dust ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the adopted galaxy formation scenario coupled with the metal poor collapsar model suggested by stellar evolution have been exploited to infer the above results , which include grb counts and redshift distribution and the complete description of the relevant properties of their hosts , such as sfr , mass in stars , chemical evolution in the cold star forming gas and in the stellar component within individual galaxy halos , with specified mass and formation redshift . in this ",
    "4 these results are discussed in the light of presently available observations and they are compared to previous studies .      the imposed metallicity threshold affects the grb progenitor redshift distribution .",
    "instead of peaking at around @xmath171 as in the case without metallicity constrain , the threshold @xmath105 yields a broad peak at @xmath140 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "a significant fraction of progenitors are expected at high redshift : approximately @xmath106 per cent at @xmath107 and approximately @xmath4 per cent at @xmath5 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "this behavior is shared by all models which associate grbs with metal poor progenitors ( e.g. natarajan et al .",
    "2005 ; langer & norman 2006 ; salvaterra & chincarini 2007 ) .",
    "in particular , our findings are similar to those inferred by langer & norman ( 2006 ) , who explored the effect of a metallicity threshold in the environment of grbs , by adopting a mass - stellar metallicity relation for galaxies and an average cosmic metallicity @xmath172 $ ] dependence on redshift @xmath173/{\\rm d}z\\approx -0.15 $ ] dex .",
    "this law , derived to reproduce the metallicity of stars in galaxies , has been extrapolated to the ism .",
    "this extrapolation implies that at @xmath174 all cosmic star formation occurs in environments with @xmath172\\la 0.1\\ , z_{\\odot}$ ] , independently of the processes occurring in galaxy halos . as a result the corresponding rate of low metallicity snae peaks at @xmath140 . in our model",
    "the combination of cooling and feedback processes implies that at @xmath175 the sfr in cold gas with @xmath176 amounts to about @xmath177 per cent of the cosmic one , due to the short timescale for gas enrichment .",
    "therefore , despite of the quite different approach , the redshift distributions of grb progenitors found by langer & norman ( 2006 ) and yoon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are very similar to ours , since their assumed sfr for metal poor stars peaks at @xmath140 , similarly to our sfr in cold gas environment ( see fig",
    ".  2 ) .",
    "the combination of the galaxy formation scenario with the low metallicity collapsar hypothesis for grb events leads to a good agreement of the predicted and observed ( bright , @xmath129 ph s@xmath3 @xmath118 ) _ swift _ counts ( see fig .",
    "this naturally follows - without any tuning - from the derived number of grb progenitors , under quite simple and plausible assumptions on the grb jet opening angle , prompt gamma - ray luminosity distribution and spectral shape , without requiring any luminosity evolution ( see   2.3 and   3.2 ) .",
    "the corresponding redshift distribution ( see fig .  5 ) implies that at this bright limit the adopted model predicts about @xmath128 grbs per year , while only one grb at @xmath5 has been identified in two years of _ swift _ operation . as a matter of fact , only for about half of the _ swift _ bursts an optical afterglow has been observed , and for only @xmath4 per cent it has been possible to infer a redshift estimate .",
    "it is therefore quite reasonable to guess that this fraction could be about @xmath126 per cent for bursts at @xmath5 ( see fiore et al . 2007 ) .",
    "recently salvaterra & chincarini ( 2007 ) obtained a good formal fit to the _ swift _ counts down to @xmath178 ph s@xmath3 @xmath118 , adopting as free parameters the count normalization and the grb lf ( two further parameters ) .",
    "they considered the case of low metallicity environment by adopting a kinematical model and predict the occurrence of only 1 grb yr@xmath3 for the _ swift _ bright flux limit ( @xmath117 ph s@xmath3 @xmath118 ) .",
    "their result imply a redshift determination efficiency for grbs greater than @xmath162 per cent .",
    "it is worth noticing that reaching completeness down to @xmath120 ph@xmath3 s@xmath3 @xmath118 would significantly increase the number of detected grbs and in turn allow to explore the universe during the recombination epoch , @xmath179 , with good statistical significance .",
    "a further decrease in the flux limit to @xmath119 ph@xmath3 s@xmath3 @xmath118 , would instead only increase the grb sample by a factor of @xmath101 ; at this flux limit practically all grbs would be detected ( see figs .  5 and 6 ) .    in order to account for the trend of grbs to be at substantial redshift firmani et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed that the grb lf is evolving .",
    "daigne et al .",
    "( 2006 ) tested the hypothesis of an increasing efficiency of grb production by massive stars with increasing redshift .",
    "detailed redshift distributions of grbs will discriminate among these different possibilities .",
    "we can conclude that the hypothesis that metal - poor , rapidly rotating massive stars are the grb progenitors ( woosley & heger 2006 ; yoon et al .",
    "2006 ) is consistent with the observed _ swift _ counts .",
    "clearly determinations of grb redshifts will be extremely informative on the progenitor and galaxy formation models .",
    "we stress that the adopted galaxy formation scenario exploits quite a standard imf , independent of the gas metallicity . as a matter of fact",
    ", we showed that the cold star forming gas is rapidly ( @xmath180 yr ) enriched to the possible threshold around @xmath181 , below which the imf might be strongly biased toward high mass stars ( see bromm et al .",
    "2001 ; schneider et al .",
    "therefore the possible contribution of pop iii stars with imf strongly biased toward high masses is not considered here .",
    "however , bromm & loeb ( 2006 ) showed that at @xmath159 the contribution of pop iii to cosmic sfr could be of order of 1/10 of the overall sfr , becoming dominant at @xmath182 ; the grb rate from pop iii massive stars would grow correspondingly .",
    "though the idea that grbs are preferentially located in metal poor environments is attractive , nevertheless observational estimates of the metal content of host galaxies are still controversial . while most of the results suggest that at high-@xmath20 grb hosts exhibit metallicity @xmath183 ( prochaska et al",
    "2007 , price et al . 2007 ) , there are claims of higher metal content ( see savaglio et al . 2003 ) .    once a metal poor ( @xmath184 ) collapsar model is assumed , our galaxy formation scenario predicts that grb hosts are very young , with age less than @xmath185 yr , independently of the halo mass .",
    "this young age directly mirrors the predicted short timescale , @xmath186 yr , of chemical enrichment of the cold gas , independently of mass .",
    "such independence makes the grb rate at high-@xmath20 a good tracer of the virialization rate of relatively small galaxy halos , @xmath187 ( see fig .",
    "a definite prediction issuing from their youth is that grb hosts should exhibit high [ @xmath1/fe]-enhancement , as their metal content directly reflects the chemical yields of core collapse snae . indeed , in the most favorable scenario of close dd progenitors , type ia snae may halve the [ @xmath1/fe ] ratio produced by the generations of massive stars in a few 10@xmath188 yr , somewhat longer than @xmath156 .",
    "recent observations by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest that @xmath1/fe ratios are more than @xmath127 times the solar value .",
    "though differential depletion could be responsible for the result , the young age of the hosts is a much more palatable explanation .",
    "the shortness of @xmath156 implies that star formation has not much proceeded , i.e. the model predicts high specific star formation @xmath189 yr@xmath3 .",
    "notice that even the specific star formation is almost independent of halo mass .",
    "specific sfrs at this high level have been claimed by several authors ( fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ; le floch et al .",
    "2003 ; christensen et al . 2004",
    "; savaglio et al . 2006 ; castro cern et al .",
    "2006 ; michaowski et al .",
    "we caution that metal poor gas may be left over particularly in external regions of relatively old galaxies , hosting a burst of star formation even if most stars already formed and the gas was already metal enriched .",
    "however , we expect that relatively evolved hosts endowed with significant stellar mass are exceptions : grb  020127 could be one of such cases ( berger et al .",
    "the vast majority of grbs are hosted by small galaxies soon after their first stars shine .",
    "since the hosts are very young galaxies , our model predicts that they are gas rich objects with large column density @xmath190 , once more independently of their galaxy halo mass .",
    "observations confirms the tendency for grb hosts to exhibit large @xmath190 ( prochaska et al .",
    "2007 ; schady et al .",
    "2007 ) . at odd with these results , tumlinson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) set stringent upper limits on the molecular hydrogen ( @xmath191 ) abundance , concluding that the fraction of molecular hydrogen @xmath192 is extremely low in the examined hosts .",
    "these authors also point out that the deficiency may be related to low dust abundance , @xmath191 formation being catalyzed on the surface of dust grains .",
    "an additional possibility is the destruction of @xmath191 by uv radiation .",
    "the model here proposed predicts that grb hosts are dust poor and are pervaded by a intense uv radiation field ; therefore they are expected to be quite poor in molecular hydrogen .",
    "concerning the uv emission , most of the hosts ( @xmath193 ) should have uv magnitude at @xmath147 in the range @xmath12 .",
    "the most luminous hosts are bright enough to be included in the already available lbg lf .",
    "interestingly , jakobsson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have shown that grb hosts are tracing the faint end of the lbg lf at @xmath194 .",
    "the predicted host ly@xmath195 luminosity should fall in the interval @xmath196 erg s@xmath3 , only marginally overlapping with the range explored by currently available ly@xmath1 lf ( fig .",
    "tanvir & levan ( 2008 ) have shown that the uv rest frame luminosity distribution of ly@xmath1 selected galaxies and grb hosts at @xmath197 are quite similar .",
    "we notice that mao et al .",
    "( 2007 ) pointed out that lae are expected to be younger , with lower stellar masses , more compact and associated with less massive halos than lbgs .    in summary",
    ", observations supports the model prediction that the grb hosts trace the faint end of the lf of lbgs and laes .",
    "a further issue concerns the amount of dust in grb hosts . while most hosts have not been detected at mid - ir or submm wavelengths ( e.g. tanvir et al .",
    "2004 ; le floch et al 2006 ; priddey et al .",
    "2006 ) in a few cases submm and radio emission have been actually detected ( michaowski et al . 2008 ) .",
    "how can the existence of these hosts be interpreted within the proposed scenario ?",
    "the model predicts that only grbs hosted in large galactic halos @xmath198 can have significant dust absorption .",
    "these also exhibit large sfr ( @xmath199 yr@xmath3 ) and relatively small stellar mass ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "these properties correspond to those inferred by michaowski et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for the submm and radio detected objects .",
    "the model also predicts that these systems should represent only @xmath200 of all the grb hosts at @xmath201 and practically disappear at @xmath202 .",
    "we stress that the conclusions regarding the host properties refer to the average grb population , and do not exclude the possibility that individual grbs might reside in low metallicity local regions within their host ( as might be the case for grb  060206 , fynbo et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the above findings have been derived in the framework of a galaxy formation scenario , where a key role is played by the energy feedbacks provided by snae and quasars",
    ". however , the fast chemical enrichment leading to gas metallicity above @xmath203 takes place at early galactic times , before quasar feedback becomes effective . on the other hand ,",
    "the stellar feedback is very relevant since it regulates the star formation activity even at early galactic times .",
    "we have explored the cosmological consequences of the assumption that metal poor and rapidly rotating single stars are the progenitors of most long grbs .",
    "our main conclusions are :    @xmath204 the overall long grb rate amounts to approximately @xmath2 yr@xmath3 sr@xmath3 .",
    "counts are reproduced by assuming a non - evolving prompt ( gamma - ray ) luminosity distribution .",
    "@xmath204 above a flux limit of @xmath117 ph s@xmath3 @xmath118 about @xmath4 per cent of grbs are predicted to be at @xmath5 and @xmath126 per cent at @xmath205 , amounting to approximately @xmath206 for two years of _ swift _ operation .",
    "only one have been located above @xmath5 in two years : this would require a redshift determination efficiency around @xmath126 per cent , to be compared with the @xmath4 per cent efficiency for events at lower @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath204 the host galaxies are very young , with age less than @xmath7 yr , gas rich ( large column densities ) but poorly extincted systems ( @xmath152 ) , because of their chemical immaturity .",
    "only the few per cent of hosts associated with large halos ( @xmath198 ) have large extinction ( @xmath207 ) , high sfr ( @xmath199 yr@xmath3 ) and can be detected at relatively bright submm flux levels .",
    "this result has implications for the origin of ` dark ' grbs [ about @xmath208 of _ swift _ grbs can be considered ` dark ' , e.g. schady et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ] , lacking a detection of the optical afterglow .",
    "dark grbs should largely comprise a population of high @xmath20 events , rather than highly extincted systems .",
    "@xmath204 the young age of hosts implies that ( i ) the specific sfr is high ( @xmath189 ) and ( ii ) the ratios of abundance of different chemical elements are just those of the respective chemical yields of type ii snae , i.e. large @xmath1-enhancements should be the rule .",

    "granato et al . ( 2004 ) have proposed a model for early galaxy formation , in which the most relevant processes ( gas cooling and inflow , star formation and gas accretion onto bh , stellar and quasar feedback , gas outflow ) are included in a set of equations , that can be solved with straightforward numerical computations . in this appendix",
    "we present a simplified version of the model describing the sfr , mass in stars and chemical evolution , which are relevant for this work .",
    "the analytical formulae presented below are very good approximations of the results found by solving the full set of equations of the model ( for details see lapi et al .",
    "2006 and mao et al .",
    "we stress that , because of their fundamental character , the equations listed below describes the main aspects of star formation and chemical evolution in protogalaxies at high redshift .",
    "when a dm halo of mass @xmath51 reaches the virial equilibrium , it contains a mass @xmath212 of hot gas at the virial temperature , @xmath213 being the mean cosmic baryon to dm mass - density ratio .",
    "the gas in virial equilibrium flows toward the central region at a rate @xmath214 where the _ condensation _ timescale @xmath215 $ ] , is the maximum between the dynamical time and the cooling time at the halo virial radius @xmath216 . when computing the cooling time , a clumping factor @xmath217 in the baryonic component is also included : @xmath218 implies @xmath219 on relevant galaxy scales at high-@xmath20 . by defining such a condensation time ,",
    "we implicitly neglect the effect of angular momentum .",
    "however , angular momentum decays on a dynamical friction timescale @xmath220 , where @xmath221 and @xmath222 is the typical mass cloud involved in major mergers ( e.g. mo & mao 2004 ) ; major mergers , which are very frequent at high redshift and in the central regions of halos , imply @xmath223 a few .",
    "the cold gas is piled up following the cooling of hot gas , is consumed by star formation ( @xmath58 ) , and is removed by the energy feedback from snae ( @xmath226 ) and quasar activity ( @xmath227 ) : @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the fraction of gas restituted to the cold component by the evolved stars . under the assumption of instantaneous recycling , @xmath230 for the adopted imf ( @xmath231 for a salpeter imf ) ; this value of @xmath229 is an upper limit , since only a fraction of evolved stars have a significant mass loss in the evolutionary phases considered here .",
    "however , the relevant results are only very weakly sensitive to the chosen value , in the physically allowed range .",
    "the mass of cold baryons that is going to be accreted onto the central supermassive bh is small enough to be neglected in the above equation ( see granato et al . 2004 ) .",
    "stars are formed at a rate @xmath232 } \\approx \\frac { m_{\\mathrm{cold}}}{t_{\\star}}~,\\ ] ] where now @xmath233 and @xmath234 refer to a mass shell @xmath235 , and @xmath236 is the star formation timescale averaged over the mass distribution .",
    "the rate of cold gas removal due to snae is parameterized as @xmath237 where the averaged efficiency @xmath238 @xmath239 depends on the number of snae per unit solar mass of condensed stars @xmath240 , the energy per sn available to remove the cold gas @xmath241 , and the specific binding energy of the gas within the dm halo , @xmath242 .",
    "following zhao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and mo & mao ( 2004 ) , the latter quantity has been estimated , for @xmath18 , as @xmath243\\ , { \\mathrm{cm}^2~\\mathrm{s}^{-2}}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath244 is the halo circular velocity at the virial radius and @xmath245 is a weak function of the halo concentration @xmath246 a few .",
    "lapi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that high redshift lfs of quasars and galaxies constrain @xmath247 ; the same value is required in order to reproduce the fundamental correlations between local ellipticals and dormant bhs .    by analyzing the results of the numerical solution of the full set of equations by granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , it is apparent that the term of quasar feedback is important only during the final stage of bh growth , around @xmath248 e@xmath249folding times ( approximately @xmath30 yr ) before the peak of quasar luminosity , when the energy discharged by the quasar is so powerful to unbind most of the residual gas , quenching both star formation and further accretion onto the supermassive bh .",
    "the time integral over the quasar bolometric power exceeds the gas binding energy after @xmath250 where @xmath251 for @xmath252 and @xmath253 for @xmath254 .",
    "therefore a good approximation for the star formation history is obtained by neglecting the quasar feedback effect in eqs .",
    "( a1 ) and ( a2 ) and by abruptly stopping star formation and accretion onto the central bh after@xmath255 since halo virialization",
    ".    then eqs",
    ".  ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) can be easily solved , with the outcome that the infalling mass declines exponentially as @xmath256 , while the sfr evolves according to @xmath257~,\\ ] ] with @xmath258 .",
    "the quantity @xmath259 is the ratio between the timescale for the large - scale infall estimated at the virial radius and the star formation timescale in the central region ; it corresponds to @xmath260 , both for an isothermal or nfw ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) density profile .",
    "the following expression well approximates the condensation timescale ( see mao et al .",
    "2007 ) : @xmath261 the scaling with redshift reflects the dependence of the dynamical time ; the weak dependence on @xmath51 reproduces the impact of the energy feedback from the quasar on the infalling gas , which is stronger for more massive halos hosting more massive bh .    in order to compute the metal content of the cold gas , one has to take into account the infall of primordial abundance gas , the enrichment due to earlier generations of stars , and outflows driven by winds generated by snae and quasars . we assume , as common , that in the cold gas there is an instantaneous mixing of metals released by stars .",
    "the corresponding simplified equation reads @xmath262 where @xmath263 the imf is denoted by @xmath264 and @xmath265 is the metal yield of stars of mass @xmath266 . from fig .  1 it is apparent that metallicity rapidly ( in a time less than a few @xmath30 gyr ) increases from primordial content to the limiting value @xmath267 with @xmath268 for the adopted imf ( @xmath269 for the salpeter imf ) .",
    "in early galaxy evolution an important role is played by dust , that absorbs the uv emission and re - radiates it in the mid and far - ir band .",
    "the amount of dust in a galaxy is expected to be correlated with that of cold gas [ or sfr , see eq .",
    "( a3 ) ] and with metallicity .",
    "mao et al . (",
    "2007 ) have shown that it is possible to describe the luminosity - reddening relation found by shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for @xmath194 lbgs with the simple law @xmath270 where @xmath145 is the attenuation at @xmath147  . by inserting in the above equation the sfr and metallicity",
    ", we get the attenuation as function of time .",
    "then the uv magnitude is simply given by @xmath271      on the other hand , for massive halos attenuation is large soon after @xmath30 yr ; this corresponds to the quick appearance of very luminous submm - selected galaxies . for these systems the model by granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) includes a sophisticated treatment of dust attenuation through the grasil code ( silva et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the scheme presented here traces the evolution of single galaxy halos as function of time , given their mass and their formation redshift .",
    "the results can be interfaced to the formation rate , @xmath55 ( see   2.2 ) yielding lfs , counts and redshift distribution for spheroidal galaxies .",
    "moreover , the quasar lf can also be reproduced ( lapi et al .",
    "2006 ) , as well as the lf of lbgs and ly@xmath1 emitters ( mao et al .",
