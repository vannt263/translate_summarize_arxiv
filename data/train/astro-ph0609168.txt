    "microquasars are x - ray binary stars which exhibit relativistic jets , i.e. , bipolar outflows of relativistic matter ejected perpendicularly to both sides of an accretion disc .",
    "the jets contain relativistic electrons that produce the synchrotron radiation detected at radio wavelength .",
    "these systems mimic many phenomena seen in quasars at smaller scales ( mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ) .",
    "the recent detection of tev @xmath0-ray emission coming from the microquasars ls 5039 and ls  i  + 61  303 ( aharonian et al . 2005a ; albert et al .",
    "2006a ) , using the ground - based cherenkov telescopes hess and magic , is a remarkable result that consolidate microquasars as a new group of very high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "moreover , this fact strengthes the analogy quasar / microquasar as it is well known that quasars are also sources of strong @xmath0-ray emission ( hartman et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the third egret catalog ( hartman et al . 1999 ) has shown that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are strong @xmath0-ray ( e@xmath1100 mev ) emitters .",
    "at least 30% of the 271 sources detected above 100 mev are agns and possibly some more agns are present amongst the still unidentified sources ( about 60% ) .",
    "all high - confidence identified agns are blazars and no radio - quiet agn was detected by egret .",
    "this fact can be explained because in blazars there is a highly relativistic outflow of particles that can produce non - thermal emission extending from radio to @xmath0-rays , being the high - energy emission produced via inverse compton scattering ( ic ) .",
    "the relativistic outflow is almost aligned with the observer s line of sight , producing relativistic beaming and amplifying the flux by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the @xmath0-ray sky at vhe ( e@xmath1 100 gev ) contains a few more than 30 sources at the tome of writing ( spring of 2006 ) .",
    "most of them are galactic sources , although there are 12 extragalactic objects ( 11 blazars and a radio galaxy , m87 ) .",
    "some of these reported blazars have been seen by hess ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005b ) and/or magic ( see albert et al .",
    "2006b and references therein ) .",
    "although by extrapolation from egret sources we should expect to detect many more sources , it is necessary to take into account that vhe @xmath0-rays are partially absorbed by the low - energy photons of the extragalactic background light ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ) , and spectral steepening above gev energies can occur .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars exhibits a double - peaked structure .",
    "one peak is in the optical / x - ray band and is due to synchrotron emission in the magnetic field of the jet .",
    "the other peak , located in the gev - tev band , is caused by ic scattering of low - energy photons .",
    "these seed photons can come from outside the jet and produce external compton scattering ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ) or be generated within the jet as a result of synchrotron radiation ( synchrotron self - compton or ssc ) ( maraschi et al .",
    "among the known 280 x - ray binaries ( liu et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) , 43 of them ( 15% ) display radio emission thought to be of synchrotron origin , being 8 high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) and 35 low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) ( rib 2005 ) .",
    "at least 15 of them have a relativistic jet and are considered microquasars .",
    "this relatively low number of microquasars probably will increase in the future due to a better sensitivity of the high resolution radio interferometers , since it might be that the majority of radio emitting x - ray binaries are microquasars ( fender 2001 ) .",
    "the hmxb microquasars are : ls  i  + 61  303 , v4641  sgr , ls  5039 , ss  433 , cygnus  x-1 and cygnus  x-3 , and the lmxb microquasars are : circinus  x-1 , xte  j1550@xmath2564 , scorpius  x-1 , gro  j1655@xmath240 , gx  339@xmath24 , 1e  1740.7@xmath22942 , xte  j1748@xmath2288 , grs  1758@xmath2258 and grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "although all of them share the relativistic jet as a common characterisitic , there are some physical properties that make them individually interesting .",
    "eight of them have ( or are suspected to have ) a black hole as a compact object , six of them display superluminal velocities , others have periodic radio emission , etc .",
    "a compilation of the properties of the microquasars in our galaxy can be found in paredes ( 2005 ) .",
    "the detection of extended non - thermal radio emission from microquasars provided clear evidence for the presence of relativistic leptons in the jets , although it was not considered that jets could emit significantly at x - rays or beyond until the detection of x - ray extended emission in some microquasars , like for instance ss  433 or xte  j1550@xmath2564 ( migliari et  al .",
    "2002 ; corbel et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "two types of approach have been used to model the emission from jets of microquasars .",
    "the hadronic approach considers that hadrons lead radiative processes at gev - tev @xmath0-rays and beyond , producing significant amounts of neutrinos , and leaving electrons as possible significant emitters only at lower energies .",
    "the other approach , the so - called leptonic models , extends the energy of leptons from synchrotron radio emitting energies up to soft @xmath0-rays exploring several scenarios that included ic and/or synchrotron emission in the jets .",
    "one of the firsts leptonic models that were able to produce vhe @xmath0-rays was developed to explain the non - thermal flares in grs  1915 + 105 ( atoyan & aharonian 1999 ) .",
    "relativistic electrons , which were suffering radiative , adiabatic and energy - dependent escape losses in fast - expanding plasmoids , caused the flares via synchrotron radiation .",
    "if the electrons were accelerated in - situ up to tev energies , the synchrotron radiation could then extend beyond the x - ray region , and the ssc radiation to high and very high energies ( see fig .  [ figgr ] ) . in this case , since grs  1915 + 105 is a lmxb , the contribution of the companion star to the ( external ) ic is not important , while in the case of hmxbs the contribution of the bright companion can be relevant .",
    "some examples of a leptonic model applied to a hmxb are given by the work of kaufman bernad et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and georganopoulos et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , in which the authors studied the case where the microquasar jet is exposed to the star photon field .",
    "kaufman bernad et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) proposed as well that recurrent and relatively rapid variability could be explained by the precession of the jet , which results in a variable doppler amplification .",
    "bosch - ramon & paredes ( 2004 ) developed a leptonic model in which ssc was taken into account , showing that this mechanism could compete with ic of star photons under certain conditions , and more recently other authors have developed models of high energy emission from microquasars showing that tev photons could be produced ( e.g. bosch - ramon et  al .",
    "2006 , dermer & bttcher 2006 ) .",
    "several hadronic models to explain the @xmath0-ray emission from microquasars have been developed in the last years .",
    "one of them , developed by romero et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , estimates the @xmath0-ray emission expected from the jet - wind hadronic interaction in a high mass microquasar ( see fig .  [ figrom ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission arises from the decay of neutral pions created in the inelastic collisions between relativistic protons , moving in a conical jet at energies of @xmath3ev , and ions from the strong wind of the stellar companion .",
    "the only requisites for the model are a windy high - mass stellar companion , the presence of multi - tev protons in the jet and enough mixing of relativistic protons and wind ions .",
    "( romero et al . 2003 ) . ]",
    "other hadronic models consider a scenario based on high energy protons that escape from the jet and diffuse through the interstellar medium ( ism ) interacting with molecular clouds .",
    "bosch - ramon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) developed a hadronic model that covers the emission from radio to vhe .",
    "they computed the spectrum of gamma - rays coming out from the p - p primary interactions via neutral pion decay , as well as the emission ( synchrotron , bremsstrahlung and ic scattering ) produced by secondary particles produced from the decay of the charged pions generated in the same p - p collisions .",
    "all the relevant energy losses were taken into account and impulsive and permanent microquasar ejections were considered .",
    "microquasars have been targets for most high - energy instruments . in table",
