    "we investigate the harary - kauffman  @xcite conjecture for a class of knots that , following  @xcite , we call the turk s head knots .    let @xmath8 be an alternating knot diagram with no nugatory crossings .",
    "if the determinant of @xmath8 is a prime number @xmath9 , then every non - trivial fox @xmath9-coloring of @xmath8 assigns different colors to different arcs of @xmath8 .",
    "turk s head link , width=432 ]    the link @xmath1 ( where @xmath0 are both integers greater than @xmath10 ) can be formed by taking a braid representation of the @xmath2 torus link and making it alternate as illustrated in figure  [ figthkmn ] . as is the case with torus links , this results in a link of @xmath11 components ;",
    "in particular , @xmath1 is a knot precisely when @xmath5 and @xmath12 are relatively prime .",
    "if @xmath13 and @xmath12 is odd , @xmath14 is a @xmath15 torus knot and is also a rational knot and a montessinos knot .",
    "the harary - kauffman conjecture is known to hold for such knots @xcite .",
    "so , we will assume that @xmath5 is at least @xmath16 .",
    "our key observation is that very few turk s head knots have prime determinant and , therefore , most @xmath1 satisfy the harary - kauffman conjecture in a trivial way .",
    "we conjecture that if @xmath1 is a turk s head knot of prime determinant , then @xmath17 . for these knots",
    "the determinant is a pell number :    [ thmdetm2]let @xmath18 .",
    "the determinant of @xmath6 is the @xmath5th pell number @xmath7 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for @xmath18 .",
    "thus , we conjecture that the only @xmath1 knots with prime determinant are the @xmath6 for which @xmath7 is a pell prime .",
    "in particular , this means that @xmath5 must be a prime .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that every non - trivial coloring of the diagram of @xmath6 assigns different colors to different arcs :    [ thmkhm2]let @xmath18 be odd .",
    "the harary - kauffman conjecture holds for the diagram of @xmath6 .",
    "to be precise , theorem  [ thmkhm2 ] verifies the conjecture for the diagram of @xmath6 shown in figure  [ figthkmn ] .",
    "however , since minimal diagrams are related by flypes  @xcite , figure  [ figthkmn ] is essentially the unique minimal diagram for this knot .",
    "thus , in addition to the case @xmath22 , we have a proof of the harary - kauffman conjecture for all @xmath1 with composite determinant",
    ". we can prove this class includes all knots with @xmath23 or @xmath5 even :    [ thmdet]let @xmath18 and @xmath4 be relatively prime integers .",
    "if @xmath24 or @xmath5 is even , then the turk s head knot @xmath1 has composite determinant .    for the remaining knots ,",
    "that is , @xmath1 with @xmath3 odd and @xmath4 relatively prime to @xmath5 , we propose a formula @xmath25 for the determinant in section 6 below , where we also show that @xmath25 is composite :    [ thmgmn]@xmath25 is composite when @xmath26 and @xmath5 is odd .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce fox coloring , the determinant , and connections with spanning trees of the checkerboard graph of a knot . in sections 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ,",
    "we prove theorems [ thmdetm2 ] , [ thmkhm2 ] , [ thmdet ] , and [ thmgmn ] , respectively .",
    "in this section we give a brief overview of the idea of fox @xmath9-coloring and its connections with the knot s determinant .",
    "a more complete discussion can be found in @xcite .    in a @xmath9-coloring of a knot diagram",
    ", we assign to each arc an integer between @xmath27 and @xmath28 such that at each crossing the over strand @xmath29 and the two under strands @xmath30 and @xmath31 satisfy the relation @xmath32 .",
    "further , at least two different `` colors '' must be used .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this is a knot invariant ; we will say that a knot is @xmath9-colorable if it has a diagram that can be @xmath9-colored .",
    "the determinant of a knot determines the valid choices for @xmath9 : a knot is @xmath9-colorable if and only if @xmath9 has a common factor with the determinant of the knot .    for an alternating knot",
    "the determinant is given by the number of spanning trees of a checkerboard graph of an alternating diagram of the knot ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the checkerboard graph is obtained by first shading alternate regions of the knot diagram .",
    "we then place a vertex in each shaded region and an edge between regions that share a crossing .",
    "figures  [ figspanmodd ] , [ figspanmeven ] , [ figwn ] , and [ figspanmn ] give examples of checkerboard graphs .",
    "see also  @xcite for an introduction to this idea .",
    "in this section we prove    let @xmath18 be odd .",
    "the determinant of @xmath6 is the @xmath5th pell number @xmath7 .",
    "is odd , the graph of @xmath6 has @xmath5 vertices.,width=259 ]     is even , the graph of @xmath6 again has @xmath5 vertices.,width=264 ]    * proof : * we use induction to show that @xmath7 is the number of spanning trees of the checkerboard graph @xmath33 of @xmath6 .",
    "the general form of the checkerboard graph @xmath33 breaks down into two cases .",
    "if @xmath5 is odd we have the graph on @xmath5 vertices shown in figure  [ figspanmodd ]",
    ". if @xmath5 is even , as shown in figure  [ figspanmeven ] , the graph again has @xmath5 vertices .",
    "first observe that the number of spanning trees of @xmath34 is @xmath35 and the number of spanning trees of @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "so the theorem holds for @xmath23 and @xmath38 .",
    "now assume that it holds for all @xmath39",
    ". we will show that it holds for @xmath40 .    , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is even.,width=264 ]    first",
    ", assume that @xmath43 is even .",
    "we will label vertices and edges for @xmath44 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 as in figure  [ figm2keven ] .",
    "given any spanning tree of @xmath44 , construct a subgraph of @xmath42 as follows .",
    "all of the unlabeled edges will remain identical .",
    "if the spanning tree for @xmath44 has edge @xmath45 , but not @xmath46 , we will remove @xmath45 and add @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . if the spanning tree for @xmath44 has edge @xmath46 , but not @xmath45 , then we will remove @xmath46 and add @xmath50 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . finally , if the spanning tree for @xmath44 has both @xmath46 and @xmath45 , then we will remove both of these edges and add @xmath50 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the newly added edges will connect @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 to the rest of the graph .",
    "all unlabeled vertices are already spanned by the original tree from @xmath44 .",
    "also , we have constructed our new graphs to avoid closed loops , so all of our new subgraphs of @xmath42 are spanning trees of @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , in order to connect @xmath54 to the rest of any spanning tree of @xmath44 , the spanning tree must be of one of the above forms .",
    "thus , for any spanning tree in @xmath44 , we have exactly one associated spanning tree for @xmath42 . denote by @xmath55 the set of spanning trees obtained in this manner from the set of spanning trees of @xmath44 .",
    "now , for any spanning tree of @xmath41 , we can get one new subgraph of @xmath42 by adding the edge @xmath48 .",
    "we can get a second subgraph by instead adding the edge @xmath49 . in either case ,",
    "the new subgraph connects @xmath52 via the new edge .",
    "all other vertices were already connected by the spanning tree of @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , we add no closed loops by adding exactly one of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , for every spanning tree of @xmath41 , we can associate two unique spanning trees for @xmath42 .",
    "denote by @xmath56 the set of spanning trees obtained in this manner .",
    "now we have two sets of spanning trees for @xmath42 with the properties that @xmath57 is the number of spannning trees for @xmath44 and @xmath58 is the twice the number of spanning trees for @xmath41 . we need to show that these two sets are mutually exclusive and that their union is the set of spanning trees of @xmath42 . to see that these two sets are mutually exclusive , it suffices to notice that every element of @xmath55 has @xmath48 and @xmath49 as edges , whereas every element of @xmath56 has exactly one of @xmath48 and @xmath49 as an edge . now",
    "if @xmath29 is a spanning tree of @xmath42 , it must contain an edge which connects @xmath52 to the rest of the graph , so it must contain @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath29 contains exactly one of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , then it must be in @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath29 contains both @xmath48 and @xmath49 , then it must also contain @xmath50 or @xmath47 , and must be in @xmath55 .",
    "so the number of spanning trees of @xmath42 is twice the number of spanning trees of @xmath41 added to the number of spanning trees of @xmath44 .",
    "but by inductive hypothesis , this means that the number of spanning trees of @xmath42 is @xmath59 , as needed .    , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is odd.,width=268 ]    now we will look at the case @xmath43 odd .",
    "again , we will label graphs @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 as in figure  [ figm2kodd ] . given any spanning tree of @xmath44",
    ", we may construct a subgraph of @xmath42 by adding in the edges @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this will connect @xmath52 and @xmath53 to the rest of the graph .",
    "we know that all other vertices are connected since we started with a spanning tree for @xmath44",
    ". there is no way for these two new edges to create a closed loop in our subgraph , so for every spanning tree in @xmath44 , we can assign a unique spanning tree of @xmath42 .",
    "we will denote the set of such spanning trees of @xmath42 by @xmath55 .    to every spanning tree of @xmath41 , we can associate two distinct subgraphs of @xmath42 as follows .",
    "if our spanning tree contains @xmath62 , but not @xmath63 , we remove this edge and add @xmath60 and either @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",
    "if our spanning tree contains @xmath63 but not @xmath62 , we replace @xmath63 by @xmath66 and add either @xmath64 or @xmath65 . if our spanning tree contains both @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then we remove these edges and add @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and either @xmath64 or @xmath65 . notice",
    "that , in the last case , we will not create a closed loop since this would imply that @xmath62 and @xmath63 would create a closed loop in our original spanning tree .",
    "furthermore , each of these cases will connect @xmath52 and @xmath53 to the rest of the graph .",
    "finally , note that every spanning tree for @xmath41 must contain @xmath62 or @xmath63 in order to connect @xmath67 to the rest of the graph .",
    "so every spanning tree of @xmath41 can be associated with two spanning trees of @xmath42 .",
    "we will call the set of spanning trees of @xmath42 so obtained @xmath56 .",
    "now we have two sets of spanning trees for @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath57 is the number of spanning trees of @xmath44 and @xmath58 is twice the number of spanning trees of @xmath41 .",
    "we must show that these two sets are mutually exclusive , and that their union is the set of all spanning trees for @xmath42 . for a subgraph of @xmath42 to be",
    "a spanning tree , @xmath52 and @xmath53 must be connected to the rest of the graph , so any given spanning tree must contain both @xmath60 and @xmath61 , but not @xmath64 or @xmath65 , placing it in @xmath55 ; both @xmath60 and @xmath61 as well as either @xmath64 or @xmath65 but not both , placing it in @xmath56 ; or it must contain exactly one of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and exactly one of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , placing it in @xmath56 .",
    "so , every spanning tree of @xmath42 is in one of these two sets .",
    "furthermore , in order for a graph to be in @xmath55 , it can not contain @xmath64 or @xmath65 , yet every graph in @xmath56 contains exactly one of these edges .",
    "thus , these two sets are mutually exclusive . in other words ,",
    "the number of spanning trees of @xmath42 is @xmath68 as needed .",
    "in this section we prove    let @xmath18 be odd .",
    "the harary - kauffman conjecture holds for the diagram of @xmath6 .    note",
    "that we require that @xmath5 be odd so that @xmath6 is a knot rather than a link of two components .    .",
    "b ) connecting the dashed lines yields @xmath69,width=249 ]    we will work with the general braid projection in figure  [ figm2]a . to extract @xmath69 , for example , from this diagram ,",
    "we need only connect two of the vertical strands with horizontal strands using the dashed lines shown . if we have labeled these strands in a @xmath9-coloring this gives rise to a constraint that the colors of the newly connected strands agree modulo @xmath9 .",
    "we break the proof of theorem  [ thmkhm2 ] into a series of lemmas .",
    "our first observation is that there is essentially only one non - trivial way to color a @xmath6 diagram . without loss of generality , color the bottom strand at",
    "left @xmath27 and the strand above it @xmath70 . as can be seen in figure  [ figacol ]",
    ", this will uniquely determine the coloring of all strands of the @xmath6 diagram up to the choice of @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath70-coefficients come in pairs that differ in sign and differ by one in absolute value :     diagram.,width=240 ]    [ lemsn ]    the @xmath70-coefficients of entering strands form adjacent pairs of opposite sign such that they differ by one in absolute value .",
    "coefficients of interior strands also form pairs of opposite sign such that the absolute value of the negative strand is one more than the absolute value of the positive strand . furthermore ,",
    "if we order the pairs as in figure  [ figacol ] and choose the positive element @xmath71 from each pair , we get the following recursive relationship : @xmath72 .",
    "* proof : * specifically , the pairs of entering strands ( at left ) alternate between the positive element being assigned to the lower strand and the negative element being assigned to the lower strand .",
    "thus , we will proceed by induction on four entering strands at a time .",
    "we can directly verify by figure  [ figacol ] that the lemma holds for @xmath69 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "assume that , the lemma holds for @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "that is , as in figure  [ figkind ] assume that the @xmath6 diagram has been colored with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we then assign the next four strands as in the figure , so that @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "this shows that the lemma also holds for @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "our goal is to show that every non - trivial coloring of @xmath6 assigns different colors to different strands .",
    "we begin by observing that the coloring with @xmath91 has this property .",
    "[ lema1 ] let @xmath18 be odd and let @xmath7 , the @xmath5th pell number , be the determinant of the turk s head knot @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath6 diagram admits a @xmath7-coloring that assigns different colors to different strands .",
    "* proof : * we may color our braid as we have done starting with zero , but let us replace @xmath70 with @xmath10 .",
    "as in lemma  [ lemsn ] , we will look at the ascending sequence @xmath71 obtained by taking the positive element of the pairs in figure 4 . observe that , in the @xmath6 diagram , the largest color in absolute value is the @xmath5th entering strand .",
    "although there are vertical strands with higher absolute value , these are forced to be equivalent to existing strands of lesser absolute value .",
    "thus , the highest absolute value for a color in @xmath6 is @xmath92 .",
    "observe that for @xmath23 , @xmath93 again , for @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "now assume that , for all @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "then ,    @xmath98    so the absolute value of the color of every strand in our coloring of @xmath6 is less than half the determinant of the knot .",
    "this means that in this particular coloring , no two strands are assigned the same color modulo @xmath7 .",
    "finally , to prove the theorem , it remains only to verify that every non - trivial @xmath7-coloring assigns different colors to different strands .",
    "* proof : * ( of theorem  [ thmkhm2 ] ) let @xmath18 be odd . as shown in theorem  [ thmdetm2 ] , the determinant of @xmath6 is the @xmath5th pell number @xmath7 . if @xmath7 is not prime , then we are done .",
    "so , we may assume @xmath7 is prime .",
    "as above , up to a parameter @xmath70 , we have essentially one way of coloring the diagram mod @xmath7 . by lemma  [ lema1 ] , when @xmath99 , that coloring assigns different colors to different strands .",
    "more generally , we ve shown that for any value of @xmath70 the strands will be labeled with different multiples of @xmath70 .",
    "so , suppose two different strands are labeled with the colors @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this means that in the @xmath99 coloring , these two strands are labeled @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and , by lemma  [ lema1 ] , @xmath104 . then ,",
    "if @xmath105 , it follows that @xmath106 .",
    "so , for any choice of @xmath70 ( beside @xmath107 which leads to a trivial coloring ) and , therefore , for any @xmath7-coloring of the diagram , different strands are assigned different colors .",
    "in this section we prove    let @xmath18 and @xmath4 be relatively prime integers",
    ". if @xmath24 or @xmath5 is even , then the turk s head knot @xmath1 has composite determinant .     is a wheel on @xmath108 vertices.,width=384 ]    *",
    "proof : * if @xmath24 , the checkerboard graph of @xmath1 is a wheel of @xmath108 vertices ( see figure  [ figwn ] ) .",
    "the number of spanning trees , and hence the determinant of @xmath1 is @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the @xmath12th lucas number ( see @xcite ) . by induction ,",
    "the determinant is @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the @xmath12th fibonacci number , when @xmath12 is even and @xmath113 when @xmath12 is odd .",
    "thus , the determinant is composite when @xmath24 .",
    "even , the checkerboard graph of @xmath1 is the tensor product of an @xmath12-cycle and a @xmath114-chain.,width=432 ]    if @xmath115 is even , the calculation of the number of spanning trees is given in @xcite . in this case , ( see figure  [ figspanmn ] ) the checkerboard graph is the tensor product of a cycle of @xmath12 vertices and a chain of @xmath114 vertices .",
    "the number of spanning trees and hence the determinant of @xmath1 is @xmath116 now , the terms @xmath117 constitute a complete set of conjugate roots of a polynomial with integral coefficients .",
    "so , their product is an integer .",
    "moreover , the product is greater than one",
    ". thus , @xmath118 is of the form @xmath12 times an integer greater than one , and therefore is composite when @xmath5 is even .",
    "in this section we derive an expression @xmath25 that , we believe , is the determinant of @xmath1 when @xmath5 is odd .",
    "we then prove            the idea is that @xmath121 is obtained by @xmath12 repetitions of the braid of figure  [ figa3 ] .",
    "if we label the strands as shown , then , using the coloring relation @xmath122 , we can view the strands @xmath123 leaving at right as being derived from those entering at left , @xmath124 , by matrix multiplication : @xmath125 . for the diagram of @xmath121 we repeat this multiplication @xmath12 times so that the vector leaving the braid at right is @xmath126 .    however , in order to have a valid coloring we require the numbers entering the braid to be the same as the numbers exiting the braid as they are in fact the same strands .",
    "that is , we require that @xmath127 . in other words , @xmath128 represents a valid coloring of @xmath1 if it is an eigenvector of @xmath129 with eigenvalue 1 .",
    "now , any constant vector @xmath130 will be an eigenvector of eigenvalue one and corresponds to the trivial coloring where all strands are assigned the same color @xmath131 .",
    "so , the matrix @xmath132 will always have 1 as an eigenvalue .",
    "if @xmath1 admits a ( non - trivial ) @xmath9-coloring , then , modulo @xmath9 , @xmath132 will have additional eigenvectors beyond the constant vectors .",
    "this means that 1 occurs as a root more than once in the characteristic polynomial of @xmath132 taken modulo @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we can discover the valid crossing moduli , and from these the knot s determinant , by looking at the characteristic polynomial of @xmath132 .",
    "below , we carry out this program to find a number @xmath25 such that the characteristic polynomial of @xmath132 does , indeed , have 1 as a multiple root modulo @xmath25 .",
    "however , this is only a necessary condition for there to be a coloring mod @xmath25 . in other words",
    ", we can show that the algebraic multiplicity of @xmath10 as an @xmath132 eigenvalue is at least two when working modulo @xmath25 .",
    "however , we ca nt be sure that the geometric multiplicity is also greater than one and so we do nt know for sure that there is valid coloring modulo @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath147 denote the characteristic polynomial of @xmath119 .",
    "by direct calculation , @xmath148 using the form of @xmath143 and @xmath145 given in equations  [ eqa2 m ] and [ eqa2m+1 ] , one can show by induction that the @xmath147 satisfy the recursion @xmath149      this sequence of polynomials is closely related to the delannoy numbers : @xmath152 the delannoy numbers are defined by the recurrence @xmath153 .",
    "for example the @xmath154 in the fifth row of equation  [ eqd ] is the sum of the three terms above it , namely @xmath137 , @xmath137 , and @xmath16 .",
    "thus , as may be verified by induction , the coefficients of the polynomials @xmath155 arising from the characteristic polynomials of the @xmath119 matrices are the delannoy numbers : @xmath156 it follows that the @xmath155 is palindromic in that @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath158 is a root of @xmath159 , then so too is @xmath160 .",
    "moreover , we can argue that these roots are positive real numbers .",
    "* proof : * in fact , we will argue that the roots of @xmath162 are real and positive .",
    "note that , since @xmath163 when @xmath5 is odd , @xmath10 is a simple root of @xmath162 .",
    "our argument will also show that @xmath10 is a double root of @xmath162 when @xmath5 is even . since @xmath164 in this case , we already know that @xmath10 is , at least , a double root .",
    "we first analyze the properties of @xmath165 and @xmath166 and show by the recursion relation that @xmath167 and @xmath168 must have the same properties ( i.e. , positive real roots and simple or double root at @xmath10 ) ; we then apply the same analysis to @xmath169 and @xmath162 .",
    "let @xmath170 be the root of @xmath171 of minimal magnitude .",

    "we conclude that @xmath168 has two roots between @xmath27 and @xmath10 , two roots at @xmath10 , and two roots after @xmath10 .",

    "the polynomial @xmath162 has @xmath212 roots before @xmath10 ; again , using the same analysis as above we find that @xmath162 and @xmath213 intersect @xmath214 = @xmath215 times , and these intersections occur between the roots of @xmath162 .",
    "thus , @xmath209 has @xmath215 roots between @xmath27 and @xmath10 , @xmath10 root at @xmath10 , and another @xmath215 roots after @xmath10 accounting for all its @xmath216 roots . also @xmath217 , and continuing with the same analysis shows @xmath209 and @xmath218 intersect @xmath215 times between @xmath27 and @xmath10 .",
    "these intersections account for @xmath5 of the @xmath219 roots of @xmath220 , and since @xmath220 has at least a double root at @xmath221 , it must be that @xmath220 has exactly a double root at @xmath221 , and @xmath219 real positive roots .",
    "let @xmath226 denote the polynomial whose roots are the @xmath12th powers of the roots of @xmath155 .",
    "in other words , the characteristic polynomial of @xmath129 is @xmath227 .",
    "note that @xmath228 so that , as promised , @xmath10 is a multiple root of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath129 modulo @xmath25 .",
    "it is also easy to verify that @xmath25 is the determinant of @xmath1 when @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , as in the case @xmath23 , the @xmath25 are squares for @xmath12 odd and of the form @xmath229 times a square when @xmath12 is even . this observation will allow us to show that @xmath25 is composite .",
    "* proof : * ( of theorem  [ thmgmn ] ) first , let @xmath4 be odd .",
    "in this case we have @xmath230 ^ 2 \\\\ & = & g_{m,1 } ( g'_{m , n})^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath231 and @xmath232 now , @xmath233 and @xmath234 is also an integer as it is a symmetric function of the roots @xmath222 .",
    "also , for each @xmath235 , @xmath236 is a positive real number greater than @xmath10 since , by lemma  [ lemapos ] , @xmath222 is a postive real number and the sum includes @xmath237 .",
