    "glendenning@xcite had realized the essentially different character of a first - order transition in simple system possessing a single conserved quantity and complex one having more than one conserved charge .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of a simple system is the constancy of the pressure during the transition from one homogeneous phase to the other .",
    "such phase transition is the typical description of first - order one in textbook .",
    "the properties of the transition are quite different in complex .",
    "the pressure varies continuously with the proportion of two pure phases in equilibrium .",
    "some quantities are obviously nonlinear functions in the proportion in the mixed phase .    as well - known",
    ", the occurrence of first - order transition will eventually accompany the release of energy .",
    "the energy is called latent heat related to the release of entropy in the example of gas - liquid transition .",
    "the phase transition at zero temperature showed the liberation of binding energy .",
    "we still use the concept of `` latent heat '' for the release of energy associated with such the first - order phase transition .",
    "the calculations of `` latent heat '' from hadronic matter to strange quark matter were firstly made by haensel and zdunik@xcite .",
    "they considered hadrons be absorbed into strange quark matter in accreting strange stars and had expected that the heat per absorbed neutron is in the range 10@xmath030mev .",
    "generally the energy release for constant - pressure phase transition at zero temperature takes place nearby a transition point where an over - compressed state , metastable , is probably the first to form and then go to a stable state@xcite .",
    "however , the phase transition in a multicomponent system takes place in a varying pressure region .",
    "an appearance of over - compressed state at every pressure is possible .",
    "so we need to face up to a series of metastable states if the assumed system has a durative transfer from one pure phase to the other . relatively speaking ,",
    "the treatment of such energy release is a more difficult task than the constant - pressure case .",
    "we will focus on solving the problem in present paper .",
    "many phase transitions in nuclear matter are the expected ones having multicomponent mixture in chemistry , the nuclear gas - liquid transition relevant to accelerator experiments , where the neutron and proton number are conserved , pion , koan condensates and deconfinement of quarks in high density , where the conserved charges are baryon and electric .",
    "typically , we will treat the problem on the converted energy taking the confined - deconfined phase transition as an example .",
    "ideally the two phase should be described selfconsistently in the same theory , but we can not solve qcd through confined - deconfined phase transition based on our present knowledge . hence we will use separate models for each phase .",
    "we describe the equation of state of hadronic matter in the framework of the relativistic mean - field theory and depict the deconfined quark matter in the mit bag model .",
    "we will study the baryon number density dependence of energy per baryon for different phases , hadronic , quark and their mixed phase .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we state our views on `` latent heat '' and formulate the problem . in sec.iii",
    "we solve numerically the equations in the confined - deconfined phase transition for the given equations of state .",
    "our discussion and conclusion will be made in sec.iv .",
    "for superdense nuclear matter where a first - order phase transition would take place , the pressure @xmath1 versus baryon number density could generally be described in figure 1 if we follow the same philosophy and method used by glendenning .",
    "correspondingly , the number density dependence of the energy per baryon could also be revealed in the figure(low panel ) .",
    "the body experiences from low density phase , mixed phase to high density phase with the number density increase .",
    "we find the suppression of the increase binding energy in the mixed phase as compared with the low density phase when the body gradually compressed .",
    "the starting point @xmath2 in the mixed phase is so conspicuous that the body may go beyond @xmath2 in low density phase to an over - compressed state and then have a transition to a stable state in mixed phase .",
    "analogous situation would appear at every point in mixed phase region .",
    "the process depicted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 should repeatedly occur through the duration when the body were transferred from @xmath2 to @xmath5 .",
    "we can consider that the transfer is nearly along the line @xmath6 , denoting the equation of state , if the over - compressed states have very small deviations from the corresponding state in mixed phase region .",
    "as well - known , the total energy and baryon number densities for the mixed phase , given by glendenning@xcite , read @xmath7 @xmath8with the volume fraction @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the volumes occupied by low density and high density phase respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the corresponding energy densities , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the baryon number densities .",
    "we further introduce the baryon number fraction @xmath16 to rewrite the equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for convenience of the following treatments , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 present high density phase and total baryon numbers .",
    "substitute @xmath19 into eq(3 ) , we get @xmath20 @xmath21    therefore eqs(1 ) and ( 2 ) become @xmath22 @xmath23    the energy per baryon(binding energy ) is expressed as @xmath24 at zero temperature the energy @xmath25 only depends on the density . the change in @xmath25 arises from the density increases by means of compression and deconfinement.the energy @xmath25 can therefore be assumed to be of the function of form @xmath26 .",
    "we find the derivative of @xmath25 with respect to @xmath27 , which reads @xmath28 furthermore @xmath29 where @xmath30    eq(10 ) shows the fact that the increase of binding energy in mixed phase amounts to the composition of two processes , the simple compressional change without phase transition and the compressional one due to the occurrence of phase transition .",
    "we define @xmath31 and hence substitute it into eq(9 ) , we immediately have @xmath32\\delta\\rho=\\left [ ( e+\\left({{\\partial}e\\over{\\partial}\\rho}\\right ) _",
    "\\eta\\delta\\rho ) - ( e+{{\\delta}e\\over{\\delta } \\rho}\\delta\\rho)\\right]\\ ] ]    in equation(11 ) , @xmath33 has been supposed invariable factor with increase density .",
    "@xmath34 indicates the the binding energy increase by a simple compression regardless of phase transition since no particle is converted to the other phase from one phase .",
    "the second term of the right - hand side in eq(9 ) or eq(12 ) is obviously associated with phase transition because it arises from the change of the baryon number fraction .",
    "we further change eq(13 ) to reveal the physical meanings of quantity @xmath35 . from an initial state(see @xmath36 in figure 1 ) to the adjacent stable state , the system suffering phase transition(see @xmath37 ) , or the adjacent metastable one , the system experiencing simple compression ( see @xmath4 ) , through a equivalent density change , the binding energies for @xmath37 and @xmath4 can be calculated as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath35 is immediately the energy difference between the metastable state and the stable one , i.e.@xmath40 , where @xmath41 represent total energies of the system for the two states .",
    "evidently @xmath35 indicates the binding energy release , just the same mechanism as the physical situation in @xcite , when the body change from the metastable state @xmath4 into the stable state@xmath37 .",
    "a very small change of density considered here is the only difference from ref@xcite and hence the energy release , @xmath35 , tends to zero .",
    "but the accumulation of a series of infinitesimal released energies is able to be nonvanishing because the system certainly experiences the finite change during real phase transition , which can be expressed by an definite integral .",
    "therefor , when we consider the assumed system with @xmath18 baryon number from pure low density phase(@xmath2 in figure 1 ) to pure high density one(@xmath5 in the figure ) , the energy release can be expressed as @xmath42\\delta\\rho,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is mean energy release per baryon .",
    "we can also calculate the energy release per converted baryon for different densities .",
    "the total energy release for given density @xmath27 in mixed phase region equals @xmath44 .",
    "meanwhile , the converted baryon numbers should be @xmath45 at infinitesimal compression @xmath46 .",
    "thus the energy release per converted baryon is calculated by @xmath47 the meanings of the formula will be displayed thoroughly when eq(12 ) is substituted into eq(15 ) , @xmath48 clearly the energy release per converted baryon is different for various baryon number density during phase transition in varying pressure .",
    "we turn back to the understandings of eq(10 ) .",
    "we easily find that the simple compression causes the binding energy increase but the phase transition leads to the reduction .",
    "the reduced energy is just about the energy release .",
    "we will numerically solve the integral(12 ) together with equations(1)and(2 ) for the transition from hadronic matter to quark matter .",
    "the low density phase represents hadronic matter , called hp for short , and the high density one indicates quark matter , qp for short .",
    "we use the equations of state in relativistic mean - field theory(rmf ) description for hadronic matter and the equations of state in mit bag model for quark matter . @xmath49 where the spinor for the baryon species b is denoted by @xmath50 , @xmath51",
    "represent meson fields .",
    "the energy density and pressure can be obtained in the familiar manner as @xmath52 @xmath53 where the coupling constants @xmath54,@xmath55,@xmath56,@xmath57 and @xmath58 can be determined by the nuclear saturation density @xmath59 , the binding energy at saturation @xmath60 , the symmetry energy@xmath61 , the compression modulus@xmath62 and the effective nucleon mass @xmath63 . in mit bag model ,",
    "the energy density and pressure of quark matter at zero temperature are given by @xmath64.\\ ] ] @xmath65.\\ ] ]    we calculate the mixed phase of hadronic and quark matter with gibbs construction which first used by glendenning@xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect coulom and surface effects in mp . the gibbs condition for mechanical and chemical equilibrium at zero temperature in mp",
    "is written as @xmath66 we will obtain eqs(1 ) and ( 2 ) by applying the condition ( 20 ) together with eqs(16)@xmath0 ( 19 ) and imposing the condition of global charge neutrality in mp      where @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively denote negative charged density of quark matter and positive one of hadronic matter . when @xmath70=0 and 1 , the global charge neutrality spontaneously come back local charge neutralities for pure hadronic matter and pure quark matter .",
    "the equilibrium chemical potentials can be determined in mp from eq(20 ) while @xmath70 can be solved from eq(21 ) .",
    "we choose the representative parameters for soft , moderate and stiff hadronic matter equations of state listed in table 1 .",
    "the bag constant is taken as @xmath71=170mev , 180mev and 190mev .",
    "we construct a series of the equations of state with mp denoted by rmfn+@xmath71(n=1,2,3 ) under those considerations . as an example , rmf1 +",
