    "beginning in the late 1990s astronomers have identified a handful of moving groups within 100 pc of earth with ages @xmath0100 myr ( for summaries see zuckerman & song 2004 , torres et al 2008 , and zuckerman et al 2011 ) .",
    "two additional nearby moving groups  castor ( montes et al 2001 ; caballero 2010 ) and carina - near ( zuckerman et al 2006 )  are somewhat older with suggested ages @xmath1200 myr , although , as discussed in section 4.2 , the proposed castor stars are actually considerably older than 200 myr .",
    "youthful , nearby stars are of interest as the most advantageous examples for study of early stellar evolution and direct imaging of self - luminous planets . for completeness sake ,",
    "we note the presence of some older stellar associations within 100 pc of earth .",
    "the age of the hercules - lyra association is recently given as 257 myr ( from gyrochronology , eisenbeiss et al 2013 ) .",
    "the ursa majoris moving group has a likely age somewhere in the range 400 - 500 myr ( king et al 2003 ; zuckerman et al 2006 ) , while hyades stream stars are generally accorded the age of the hyades cluster ( @xmath1600 myr ) .",
    "inspection of table 1 in torres et al ( 2008 ) reveals that the mean v component of galactic space velocity ( uvw ) for known moving groups within @xmath1100 pc of earth and with ages @xmath3100 myr always lies between -14 and -28 km s@xmath2 .",
    "a similar picture can be seen in figure 6 of zuckerman & song ( 2004 ) .",
    "while investigating a mostly unpublished list of young stars compiled by two of us ( is and bz ) and mike bessell , we noted that hip 17338 possesses an infrared excess in the wise catalog ( wide - field infrared survey explorer ; wright et al .",
    "2010 ) and is obviously very young ( see appendix a1 ) , yet has a v velocity well outside the range -14 to -28 km s@xmath2 .",
    "additional study revealed that the uvw of hip 17338 is identical to that of the 15-member octans association defined by torres et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "however , given its large mean distance from earth ( 141 pc ) , deep - southern sky - plane location , and sparseness , there is little reason to postulate a direct association between the octans association and hip 17338 ( which is located only 50 pc from earth )",
    ". none of the 15 octans association stars are in the hipparcos catalog .",
    "we therefore undertook a search for hipparcos stars within 100 pc of earth that might have ages and uvw similar to that of hip 17338 .",
    "the results of this search are presented in section 3 and tables 1 and 2 . because most of these stars are probably older than the `` 20 myr ? ''",
    "torres et al ( 2008 ) attribute to their octans association , and because of the very different sky - plane and parallax distribution of the torres et al stars and the table 1 stars , we dub the latter stars the `` octans - near association '' .    the uvw of the castor moving group , as considered by montes et al ( 2001 ) , is not too dissimilar from that of octans - near .",
    "however , as discussed in section 4.2 , if the castor group exists at all , then it is substantially older than octans - near .",
    "thus , distinguishing whether a given star might belong to octans - near or to castor typically is not difficult .",
    "the search criteria were simple . for hipparcos stars with known radial velocities and within 100 pc of earth we calculated uvw velocities and compared these to those of the octans association ( which are given in the notes to table 1 ) . if all three components of velocity for a given star agreed within about twice the sum of the velocity errors for the star and the velocity dispersion of the octans association , then we further investigated the star to determine its age via methods described in section 3 .",
    "we used the hamilton echelle and kast grating spectrometers ( vogt 1987 ) on the 3-m shane telescope at lick observatory to obtain spectra of many of the stars discussed in section 3 and table 1 .",
    "a primary motivation was to measure the strength of the lithium absorption line at 6708   which is often a good youth diagnostic for stars of spectral type mid - f and later ( e.g. , zuckerman & song 2004 ) .",
    "the spectrometer parameters and observing dates are given in table 3 .",
    "all data were reduced using standard iraf packages .",
    "equivalent widths ( ew ) were measured by fitting a voigt profile in iraf to spectral features . with the hamilton we could measure an ew of @xmath110 m@xmath4 when a signal - to - noise of @xmath150 was reached . where the words `` this work '' appear in column 5 of table 2 , then the quoted lithium ew are from hamilton spectra ; kast spectra ew are always in reasonable agreement .",
    "a representive spectrum from each spectrometer appears in figure 1 .",
    "all primary stars in tables 1 and 2 for which lithium spectra were obtained are bright and the signal - to - noise was always large .",
    "all lithium ew were measured independently from the spectra by either two or three persons ; based on the dispersion in these measurements we estimate an internal ew error of @xmath510 m .",
    "external errors are usually comparable as may be seen by comparing our lithium ew with those measured by others for some stars listed in appendix a ; the only star where the total dispersion in measured ew is larger than 20 m  is hip 110778 .",
    "we calculated the vsini of stars in our sample by measuring the fwhm of absorption features near 6430@xmath4 , following the procedure outlined in strassmeier et al .",
    "typical uncertainties are 2 - 3 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these velocities are listed in column 3 of table 2 , while the literature values ( largely taken from glebocki & gnacincki 2005 ) are listed in column 2 .",
    "we calculated the uvw in table 1 with radial velocities from gontcharov ( 2006 ) and occasionally other sources , and parallaxes and proper motions from hipparcos ( van leeuwen 2007 ) .",
    "as noted in section 2 , the uvw of stars tested for membership in octans - near were initially taken to ( nearly ) match those of the octans association proposed by torres et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "the value of the means of uvw , for the octans association and for octans - near stars listed in section a of table 1 , are given in the notes to table 1 .",
    "because the binary star hip 813 is obviously youthful ( see appendix a1 ) , it is included in section a even though its v velocity appears to be somewhat discrepant from those of the octans association and of octans - near .",
    "in addition to the usually derived error in v given in table 1 , for hip 813 there is an additional uncertainty of @xmath00.5 km s@xmath2 due to the orbital motion of the binary . in the event that hip 813",
    "is not included as an octans - near star , then the mean v velocity of the other 13 systems is -4.0@xmath51.5 km s@xmath2 .",
    "when hip 813 is included , the dispersion in each component of uvw for the proposed octans - near stars in section a of table 1 is , on average , about 1.5 times those of associations listed in tables 1 and 2 of torres et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "however , these associations are mostly more compact , or closer to earth , or younger than stars in table 1a .",
    "the lower three panels in figure 2 display the dispersion in uvw for stars listed in sections a and b of table 1 , as well as some stars from the postulated castor moving group ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "the upper panels in figure 2 display the distribution in the sky of the same stars in xyz coordinates , where x , y and z are directions that correspond to those of uvw ( given in the notes to table 1 ) , and with their origin at the sun .    evidently , the proposed octans - near stars have a substantial spread in xyz ; this spread is similar to those of some associations listed in table 2 and displayed in figures in torres et al ( 2008 ) , including the octans association itself .",
    "what distinguishes octans - near from most of these other associations ( although not from the octans association itself ) is the relatively low space density ( stars per cubic pc ) of octans - near .",
    "as noted in section 2 , we considered only hipparcos stars with known radial velocities .",
    "therefore , this apparent low space density may be , at least in part , a selection effect .",
    "that is , the stars listed in table 1a are clearly `` top - heavy '' in mass , being dominated by a - type stars .",
    "this distribution is not to be expected in any normal star formation scenario and , therefore , many k- and m - type octans - near stars may be discovered when parallaxes of additional low mass stars are measured .    for stars later than early - f type , age estimates in table 1 are based primarily on lithium 6708   equivalent width ( ew ) and to a lesser extent on activity indicators .",
    "figure 3 displays li 6708   ew for f - g- and k - type stars listed in table 1 , sections a and b , along with octans association stars ( da silva et al 2009 ) and pleiades cluster members ( soderblom et al 1993 ) .",
    "it appears that four of the octans - near systems might be as young as the proposed 20 myr age of the octans association ( torres et al 2008 ) ; this includes cd-58 860 which is the open diamond symbol .",
    "all other plotted octans - near stars from table 1 , sections a and b , appear to be as old or older than the pleiades and the same may be said for one or two octans association stars .",
    "for late - b and a - type stars in table 1a , we use placement on a color - magnitude diagram ( zuckerman 2001 , vigan et al 2012 , zuckerman & song 2012 , nielsen et al 2013 ) . beginning with jura et al ( 1998 ) and lowrance et al ( 2000 ) a low placement",
    "has been interpreted as indication of a youthful a - type star and , as may be seen in figure 4 , the a - type stars in table 1a all plot near the locus of @xmath1100 myr old pleiades members .",
    "however , nielsen et al ( 2013 ) demonstrate that such a placement is only a necessary , but not a sufficient , condition for youth . of the seven b- and a - type stars in table 1a ,",
    "six have either a young late - type companion or excess infrared emission , all of which point to a youthful age consistent with their placement on the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "details may be found in section 4.1 and appendix a1 .",
    "however , neither placement on a color - magnitude diagram nor the presence of excess infrared emission ( i.e. , a debris disk ) can do more than indicate that any individual early - type star is likely to be @xmath1100 myr old .    to better understand the applicability of stellar magnetic activity as an age indicator for youthful stars , we compared the fractional x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath6/l@xmath7 ) of our candidate octans members with that of nearby young moving groups ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity traces the coronal magnetic activity , which typically decreases as a function of age and stellar mass ( zuckerman & song 2004 , mamajek & hillenbrand 2008 ) .",
    "we used rosat bright and faint source catalogs to obtain x - ray count rates and then the relation given in schimitt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to convert to x - ray fluxes .",
    "visual magnitudes , b - v colors , and the bolometric correction values given in kenyon and hartman ( 1995 ) were used to calculate stellar bolometric fluxes . by plotting b - v ( which traces stellar mass ) against l@xmath6/l@xmath7",
    ", we see that young stars in nearby moving groups ( @xmath8 pic - 12 myr ; tuc - hor- 30 myr ; ab dor - 70 myr ) lie along one path while older stars in the hyades cluster ( @xmath1600 myr ) follow another .",
    "the x - ray ages listed in table 1 were estimated from figure 5 .",
    "we considered using the x - ray - age relations from mamajek & hillenbrand ( 2008 ; see their equation a3 ) .",
    "their equation for an x - ray age is based on an empirically determined relation between chromospheric activity and age ( their equation 3 ) and an observed correlation between x - ray activity and chromospheric activity ( their equation a2 )",
    ". however , the candidate octans stars are already surmised ( from lithium ew ) to be quite young ( @xmath9100 myr ) and many fall in the  very active \" regime ( logr@xmath10@xmath11 - 4.35 and log(l@xmath6/l@xmath7)@xmath11 - 4.0 ) where the correlation between x - ray and chromospheric activity begins to break down ( here , r@xmath10 specifies ca ii h & k emission ; table 2 ) .",
    "we therefore choose to use the empirical relationship from zuckerman & song ( 2004 ) to estimate x - ray ages ( see previous paragraph ) .",
    "we used the chromospheric activity relation from mamajek & hillenbrand ( their equation 3 ) to estimate the activity age of stars in our sample with logr@xmath12@xmath10 values available in the literature . while we used these ages to provide general support for stars being older or younger than @xmath1100 myr",
    "( see vican & schneider 2013 for further details ) , we gave them relatively low weight in comparison with lithium - based ages .    to summarize the discussion of age diagnostics , of the methods that can be applied to the octans - near stars we regard lithium abundances , as per figure 3 , to give the most reliable and quantitative ages .",
    "from this presentation of f- , g- and k - type stars , it is clear that most of the octans association stars proposed by torres et al ( 2008 ) and some of the proposed octans - near stars are younger than the pleiades , while other octans - near and octans association stars are as old as or somewhat older than the pleiades . for f- , g- and k - stars this young , activity ages are not as diagnostic . for b- and a - type stars , while no single age dating method is as precise as li abundances , a combination of low placement on a color - magnitude diagram and the presence of a substantial dusty debris disk and/or an active companion star point to youth .",
    "a star is included in tables 1 and 2 if each component of uvw is consistent with that of the association mean .",
    "`` consistency '' in this context implies that all 3 stellar components of uvw match those of the association mean within the sum of the quoted error in stellar velocity and the standard deviation of the dispersion among the association velocities .",
    "however , because errors in uvw can be underestimated ( see next paragraph ) , because a standard deviation is not an absolute limit , and because these tables list `` proposed '' association members , we have tended to err somewhat on the side of including a potential non - member in preference to losing a true member .    given errors in measuring radial velocities , especially of early a - type stars , and , to a lesser degree , errors in hipparcos parallaxes , some proposed members will probably ultimately turn out to be non - members . in the present work and that of our earlier papers ( zuckerman et al 2011 ; zuckerman & song 2012 ) we have adopted the gontcharov ( 2006 ) radial velocities and their errors while recognizing that these errors are likely to be too optimistic for some stars .",
    "we adopt hipparcos parallaxes from van leeuwen ( 2007 ) while anticipating that some of these may not be correct ( for example , hip 30675 considered by zuckerman & song 2012 ) .",
    "in the spirit of zuckerman & song ( 2004 ) , we searched for hipparcos stars with common galactic space motions within 100 pc of earth and with age @xmath0100 myr .",
    "the result is the proposed octans - near association in part a of tables 1 and 2 .",
    "these stars appear to have ages between about 30 and 100 myr . notwithstanding their similar uvw ,",
    "it is unclear how stars with such a large spread ( @xmath170 myr ) in apparent age as those listed in part a of table 1 could have their origins in a given molecular cloud or cloud complex . in appendix",
    "a we consider individual stars in table 1",
    ".    of the octans association stars proposed by torres et al ( 2008 ) only cd-58 860 , at a quoted distance of 82 pc , satisfies our proximity requirement .",
    "its spectral type ( g6 ) and 6708   lithium ew ( 225 m ) suggest an age @xmath130 myr ( the open diamond in figure 3 ) . while cd-58 860 is not a hipparcos star , for ages in the range 30 - 100 myr , a photometric distance @xmath190 - 100 pc can be derived from figure 2 in zuckerman & song ( 2004 ) .",
    "the best match with the uvw of octans - near ( and the octans association ) is found for a distance @xmath190 pc .",
    "the distance from earth and sky - plane position ( 4h11 m -58d ) of cd-58 860 are not far from some stars listed in table 1a .",
    "thus , cd-58 860 may reasonably be considered an octans - near member .      as noted in appendix a1 ,",
    "three of the stars in part a of table 1 have previously reported excess infrared emission above the photosphere ( su et al 2006 ; rhee et al 2007 ) .",
    "we searched all stars in table 1 for excess ir emission in one or more of the four wise bands .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) were fit to the optical and ir flux densities as described in vican & schneider ( 2013 ) .",
    "seds were created with an automated fitting technique that fits the stellar radius and temperature to the hauschildt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) photosphere models .",
    "a simple single - temperature blackbody was then fit to the dust excess .",
    "the resulting seds are found in figure 6 for the five table 1a stars with definite excesses , and in figure 7 for the two stars with possible excesses ( see discussion below ) .",
    "all wise data products were checked to make sure that the apparent 22 @xmath13 m ( w4 ) excess was not due to a background galaxy or cirrus contamination .",
    "because the sed fitting procedure suggested the possibility of small ( but individually not statistically significant ) w4 excesses for many of the octans stars , we carried out an additional excess check that utilized only the w3 ( 11.6 @xmath13 m ) minus w4 magnitude .",
    "this check involved octans stars and , also , stars measured with the spitzer space telescope , as described in the paragraphs that follow . based on the wise calibration procedure , for late b- to early k - type stars as",
    "appear in table 1 , we anticipated that , for the ensemble of stars without excess emission in the w4 band , the w3 minus w4 color ( in vega magnitudes ) would be zero .",
    "we defined an excess sigma ( @xmath14 ) for a given star as ( w3-w4)/e , where `` e '' equals the mean w4 error given in the wise catalog .",
    "as noted two paragraphs below , 7 stars in part a of table 1 individually show no obvious evidence for excess emission in w4 .",
    "nonetheless there is a positive bias among these 7 , with @xmath14 ranging between 0 and 2.5 for the individual stars and with a mean of 1.55 for the 7 stars .",
    "similarly , for the 13 stars in table 1 part b plus part c , the mean @xmath14 is 1.64 ( the 13 stars include hip 66704a & b and gj 4185a & b ) .    to check whether this apparent red w3-w4 color might indicate a small average ir excess in table 1 stars or , alternatively , a small calibration error in the wise 3 or wise 4 zero - point flux density , we examined the w3-w4 color of 19 stars without 24 @xmath13 m , and usually also without 70 @xmath13 m , excess emission in a spitzer - measured sample discussed in zuckerman et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "these 19 stars are likely members of the ab dor , tuc / hor , and argus young moving groups which have ages similar to those of the 14 stars in part a of table 1 .",
    "the mean @xmath14 for the 19 spitzer - measured stars is 1.55 with a standard deviation of 0.92 and a mean error of 0.22 .",
    "this comparison suggests that there is a few @xmath15 calibration error in the relative w3 and w4 zero - points and that an apparent excess in the w4 band smaller than about 5 @xmath14 , ( with @xmath14 as defined above ) , is not significant .    of the 14 primary stars in part - a of tables 1 and 2 , five ",
    "hip 10670 , 17338 , 19990 , 22192 , 36624  definitely have excess infrared emission indicative of a dusty debris disk ( figure 6 ) .",
    "all five stars , with the possible exception of 19990 , have excess emission in the 22 @xmath13 m w4 band of wise . of the other 9 stars , two",
    " hip 813 , 115527  might have excess emission in the w4 band ( figure 7 ) .",
    "if , say , one of these two possible excess stars , actually has an excess , then 43% of stars in part - a have excess ir emission .",
    "such a high percentage is consistent with ages @xmath0100 myr ( e.g. table 11 in zuckerman et al 2011 which focuses on stars in clusters and moving groups ) .",
    "if only the seven a- and b - type stars in part a are considered , then four have definite ir excesses and one other ( hip 813 , which surely is young , see appendix a1 ) might also ; this is again a very high percentage of detectable dusty debris disks , suggestive of youth .",
    "su et al ( 2006 ) consider excess 24 @xmath13 m emission from a - type stars in clusters and in the field ; their figure 4 depicts the ratio ( r@xmath16 ) of the observed 24 @xmath13 m flux density to that expected for the photospheric emission .",
    "for the five a and b stars in table 1a listed in the previous paragraph that have definite or possible excess emission at w4 , the mean r@xmath16 is @xmath11.4 . as may be seen from the su et al figure 4 , this ( large ) value of r@xmath16 is primarily characteristic of stars with ages @xmath0100 myr .",
    "hip 16095 is one of the two a- and b - type stars in table 1a with neither excess infrared emission nor a resolved , young , late - type companion .",
    "however , hip 16095 is an x - ray source ( see appendix a1 ) and very likely has an active , unresolved , youthful companion .",
    "thus , six of the seven a- and b - type stars in table 1a possess a youth indicator in addition to their low placement on the color - magnitude diagram .      of the moving groups and associations listed in zuckerman & song ( 2004 ) and torres et al ( 2008 ) none have uvw similar to that of octans - near .",
    "however , a castor moving group has been considered by various authors ( e.g. , anosova & orlov 1991 ; barrado y navascues 1998 ; montes et al 2001 ; caballero 2010 ) .",
    "the number of proposed candidate castor group members in these various papers range from 10 separate systems ( anosova & orlov 1991 ) to @xmath150 systems ( caballero 2010 ) . of 26 systems considered by barrado",
    "y navascues ( 1998 ) , he concludes that only 16 are physically associated and he expresses doubts as to whether a castor moving group exists .",
    "notwithstanding this uncertainty , he proposes a uvw for the group of -10.7 , -8.0 , -9.7 ( 3.5 , 2.4 , 3.0 ) km s@xmath2 which was subsequently adopted by montes et al ( 2001 ) and by caballero ( 2010 ) .",
    "anosova & orlov ( 1991 ) include fomalhaut and its companion gj 879 as members of their proposed castor moving group .",
    "barrado y navascues includes fomalhaut , and also adds vega ; he suggests ages of 200@xmath5100 myr for these two famous stars .",
    "this age was then adopted by montes et al ( 2001 ) and by caballero ( 2010 ) .",
    "while montes et al do not explicitly list a - type members of their proposed moving groups , fomalhaut would be included by virtue of their inclusion of tw psa which is `` unequivocally a physical stellar companion to fomalhaut '' according to mamajek ( 2012 ) .",
    "caballero explicitly includes vega , fomalhaut and tw psa as candidate castor moving group members .",
    "we identify some problems with a castor moving group as discussed by the above authors . while the proposed age has been 200 myr , the best recent age estimates are 440@xmath540 and 700 + 150/-75 myr for fomalhaut and vega , respectively ( mamajek 2012 ; monnier et al 2012 ) . to further check the age of the proposed castor group we used the hamilton echelle spectrometer to measure the lithium 6708   line in pr vir , gy boo , ms dra , and bd+21 3245 .",
    "these k0 to k3 type stars are castor moving group candidates according to caballero ( 2010 ) . in all cases",
    "the lithiium line is undetected with upper limit of order 10 m . for early k - type stars this would correspond to stars no younger than the uma group with an age of 400 - 500 myr ( see figures in zuckerman & song 2004 and zuckerman et al 2006 ) .",
    "for an age of 400 myr a difference in galactic v velocity of even 3 km s@xmath2 would result in a spread in location in the galactic plane of a kpc . yet",
    "differences in v among many of the proposed castor group stars are greater than 3 km s@xmath2 ( e.g. , table 6 in montes et al 2001 ) .",
    "for example , for vega and fomalhaut we calculate respective uvw of -18.4 , -12.4 , -9.7 ( 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.1 ) km s@xmath2 and -5.8 , -8.3 , -11.0 ( 0.2 , 0.1 , 0.5 ) km s@xmath2 , yet these two stars are within 15 pc of each other . as may be seen in the lower panels of figure 2 , the uvw dispersion of castor stars is substantial .",
    "we have identified 17 late - b through early - m type stars in 14 separate systems within 100 pc of earth with similar galactic space velocities uvw and ages in the range 30 - 100 myr . because these uvw are similar to those of a previously defined octans association at much larger distance from earth ( torres et al 2008 ) , we dub these newly identified youthful stars the `` octans - near '' association . of the 15 octans association stars proposed by torres et al ,",
    "only cd-58 860 also qualifies as an octans - near member .",
    "if a moving group is envisioned as a set of stars that were born more or less together in a given molecular cloud or cloud complex , then the likely large spread in ages ( @xmath170 myr ) and sky position of the proposed octans - near stars is troublesome .",
    "octans - near has no obvious `` nucleus '' such as characterizes the tucana association ( zuckerman & webb 2000 ) , the ab dor moving group ( zuckerman et al 2004 ; barenfield et al 2013 ) , and the carina - near moving group ( zuckerman et al 2006 ) .",
    "the proposed octans - near stars also have a somewhat ( factor of @xmath11.5 ) larger dispersion in galactic space velocities ( uvw ) than do the associations listed in torres et al ( 2008 ) . in the 1960s",
    ", eggen introduced the idea of a local association of youthful stars ( e.g. , eggen 1965 and citations of earlier papers by eggen ) .",
    "eggen s extensive local association , also referred to as the pleiades moving group , was envisioned to include both field stars and stars in some well known clusters and , in this sense , differed greatly from our proposed , sparse , octans - near association .",
    "the referee has suggested that , given the above issues , the stars in table 1 might best be called the `` octans - near complex '' .",
    "ultimate resolution of whether the octans - near stars actually form a true moving group may come from future accurate parallax and radial velocity measurements . notwithstanding",
    "this uncertainty , the octans - near stars are sufficiently young and close to earth that they should be good targets for direct planet - imaging searches with extreme adaptive optics systems on large telescopes .    whatever the outcome of future observations , there is little doubt that a significant number of nearby stars with ages @xmath0100 myr exist with uvw near -13 , -4 , -11 km s@xmath2 which is distinctly different from those of any moving group within 100 pc of earth considered by zuckerman & song ( 2004 ) and torres et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "perhaps as many as 50% of the 14 octans - near primary stars display excess infrared emission above the stellar photosphere in the wise4 ( 22 @xmath13 m ) band .",
    "we examined the wise3 ( 11.6 @xmath13 m ) and w4 band magnitudes of octans - near stars and also stars previously measured with the spitzer space telescope that lack 24 @xmath13 m and , usually , 70 @xmath13 m excess emission . from this comparison",
    "we deduce that there is a few percent relative zero - point calibration offset between the w3 and w4 bands .",
    "this offset was taken into account when we evaluated whether or not a given octans - near star had excess emission in the w4 band .    the possibility of a moving group associated with the bright , multiple , star castor has been considered in the literature for over two decades . based in part on recent age estimates for some proposed castor moving group members and on our own lithium abundance measurements of some other proposed members , we conclude that there exists no convincing evidence for a castor moving group .",
    "this putative group ( see caballero 2010 for a recent accounting of proposed group members ) suffers from two important flaws . first is a wide spread in ages amounting to hundreds of myr among proposed members .",
    "second is a spread of many km s@xmath2 in the v component of galactic motion . for a typical castor stellar age of @xmath1400 myr , a spread of even 3 km s@xmath2 would disperse coevally born stars over a galactic arc of length of order a kpc .",

    "here we consider the stars in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "assignment of a given star into parts a , b or c of these tables is based primarily on how the estimated age compares with 100 myr ( or less ) and the similarity between the uvw of the star and that of the mean uvw for the proposed octans - near association ; this mean uvw ( see footnote to table 1 ) is essentially identical to the uvw of the much more distant octans association defined by torres et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "as we have noted , the spatial location and estimated age of many octans - near stars differ substantially from octans association stars .",
    "therefore , the two groups need not have identical uvw . nonetheless , most of the stars in parts b and c of tables 1 and 2 appear to be both older and have uvw that differ noticeably in at least one component of velocity from that of octans - near .",
