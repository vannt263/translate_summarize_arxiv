    "the interaction of water with surfaces of amorphous silica is of great technological interest  @xcite , and thus numerous studies have been devoted to this issue ranging from ir spectroscopy  @xcite to numerical methods using both _ ab initio _",
    "techniques  @xcite and classical md simulations  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the possible existence of small  membered si ",
    "o rings on sio@xmath0 surfaces has been intensely discussed since such rings are expected to be the reactive centres for the interaction with water and other molecules .",
    "it is well  known that water may dissociate on sio@xmath0 surfaces resulting in the formation of silanol ( si  oh ) groups .",
    "these silanol groups can be detected in spectroscopic experiments via the si ",
    "oh stretching mode near 3750  @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "in particular it is believed that the silanol groups are a result of the interaction of water molecules with small  membered rings  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the reaction of a water molecule with a two  membered ring on an amorphous silica surface . to this end , we combine classical md simulations using the so  called bks potential  @xcite for silica and _ ab initio _ car  parrinello md ( cpmd )  @xcite .",
    "this combination of methods has recently also been used for investigating silicates in the bulk  @xcite and of free silica surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the idea in our case is to generate configurations with a free surface by `` bks  md '' which are then the starting configurations for cpmd runs .",
    "the advantages of this methodology are two  fold : on the one hand , in the classical md amorphous systems can be relaxed on a nanosecond time scale whereas typical time scales for the cpmd are only of the order of several picoseconds . on the other hand ,",
    "the cpmd provides a much more realistic modeling of atomistic systems .",
    "this is of special importance in the case of interactions of water with an sio@xmath0 surface since it is difficult to model these interactions realistically by classical potentials .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we describe how we have prepared a free silica surface by classical md and give the details of the cpmd simulations .",
    "then , the results for the water interaction with the two  membered ring are presented in sec .",
    "finally , we summarize the results .",
    "in order to study the reaction of a silica surface with a water molecule , we first have to prepare sio@xmath0 configurations with a free surface . as we have already mentioned in the introduction we use for this a combination of classical md and cpmd .    as a model potential for the classical md we use the",
    "so  called bks potential  @xcite which is a simple pair potential of the following form : @xmath3 \\ ,      \\label{bks}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the distance between an atom of type @xmath5 and an atom of type @xmath6 .",
    "the effective charges are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 can be found in the original publication .",
    "they were determined by using a combination of _ ab initio _ calculations and classical lattice dynamics simulations .",
    "the long  ranged coulomb forces ( and the potential ) were evaluated by means of the ewald summation technique . as an integrator for the simulation we used the velocity form of the verlet algorithm  @xcite with a time step of @xmath12  fs .    in order to investigate a system with free surfaces one could consider a film geometry , i.e.  a system with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in two directions and free boundaries in the third direction .",
    "unfortunately , this is not a very good approach since the ewald summation technique for the long ranged coulomb interactions becomes inefficient in this case .",
    "this stems from the fact that the fourier part of the ewald sums can no longer be calculated by a single loop over the number of particles @xmath13 as in the case of pbc in all three directions , but one has to compute a double loop that scales with @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have adopted in this work a different strategy in that a system with pbc in all three directions was simulated containing an empty space @xmath15 in @xmath16direction .",
    "the preparation of the interface is done by the following steps : i ) we start with a system at @xmath17  k with pbc in all three directions ( box dimensions : @xmath18    and @xmath19   ) .",
    "this system is fully equilibrated within 1  ns ( see also below ) . as a result",
    ", configurations are obtained that indicate a realistic modelling of sio@xmath0 with the empirical bks potential , eq .",
    "( [ bks ] ) : a tetrahedral si ",
    "o network is formed containing defects ( e.g.  five  fold coordinated silicon atoms ) which are expected at a temperature as high as @xmath17  k. however , no artificial bonds such as si ",
    "si or o  o bonds are found in the resulting network structures .",
    "ii ) we cut the system perpendicular to the @xmath16direction into two pieces .",
    "this is only done for oxygen ",
    "silicon bonds such that we get only free oxygen atoms at this interface .",
    "iii ) these free oxygen atoms are now saturated by hydrogen atoms .",
    "the place of these hydrogen atoms is chosen such that each of the new oxygen ",
    "hydrogen bonds is in the same direction as the oxygen ",
    "silicon bonds which were cut and have a length of approximately @xmath20   .",
    "the interaction between the hydrogen and the oxygen atoms as well as the silicon atoms are described only by a coulombic term .",
    "the value of the effective charge of the hydrogen atoms is set to 0.6 which ensures that the system is still ( charge ) neutral .",
    "iv ) we permanently freeze atoms which have a distance from the interface that is less than @xmath21   , whereas atoms that have a larger distance can propagate subject to the force field , thus generating a mobile layer of 14.5   .",
    "v ) we add in @xmath16direction an empty space @xmath22    . with this sandwich geometry",
    "we can use periodic boundary conditions in all three directions .",
    "we have made checked that the value of @xmath15 is sufficiently large to ensure that the structure of the free surface is not affected by the immobilized part of the system  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have a system of 91 oxygen , 43 silicon , and 10 hydrogen atoms in a simulation box with @xmath18    and @xmath23   .",
    "we have done 125 independent runs where we have equilibrated the system for 1 ns .",
    "for the present study we have selected from these runs one configuration that has exactly one two  membered ring on its surface .",
    "this configuration was then quenched to @xmath1  k using a cooling rate of @xmath24  k / s where it was further relaxed for 0.25  ns .",
    "subsequently the final configuration of this run has been used as a starting point for the cpmd .    in the cpmd",
    ", we used conventional pseudopotentials for silicon and oxygen and the blyp exchange functions  @xcite .",
    "the electronic wave  functions were expanded in a plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 60  ry and the equations of motion were integrated with a time step of 0.085  fs for 0.2  ps . in the analysis of the cpmd",
    "run only those configurations were taken into account that were produced later than 5  fs after the start of the cpmd run in order to allow the system to equilibrate at least locally  @xcite .",
    "on intermediate length scales the surface structure of sio@xmath0 can be well distinguished from its bulk structure by the ring distribution  @xcite .",
    "a ring is defined as the shortest closed loop of @xmath25 consecutive si  o elements . the sio@xmath0 surfaces that were obtained from the bks  md at @xmath17  k showed a relatively high concentration of 2membered rings , i.e.  edge  sharing tetrahedra , in contrast to the bulk in which , even at high temperatures , such structures are basically absent .",
    "the relaxation of the surfaces by cpmd reduced the number of 2membered rings significantly at @xmath17  k. at @xmath1  k , the time scale on which the system is relaxed by means of cpmd ( 0.2  ps ) is not sufficient to cause a rearrangement of ring structures and thus the number of 2membered rings does not change during the cpmd  @xcite .",
    "however , both at @xmath17  k and at @xmath1  k , the cpmd yielded a slightly different geometry of 2membered rings which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a . for bks",
    " md as well as cpmd one finds a nearly planar geometry of two  membered rings . whereas in cpmd a nearly quadratic shape with an o ",
    "si  o angle around 90@xmath26 is seen , the bks ",
    "md leads to a trapezoid geometry with an o ",
    "o angle around 80@xmath26 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the distance between nearest si  o and o  o neighbors is larger in cpmd while the distance between the silicon atoms in the 2fold ring is approximately around 2.5    in both methods .",
    "a similar behavior can be seen for the 3fold rings ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) which exhibit also a nearly planar geometry .",
    "also , in this case bks  md and cpmd show a similar si",
    " si distance ( between nearest si neighbors ) around 3.0    while the si ",
    "o distance is slightly larger in the cpmd . as a consequence , in the bks ",
    "md , the typical o ",
    "o angle is 99@xmath26 whereas in the cpmd an o ",
    "si  o of 107@xmath26 is found which is close to the angle of 109.47@xmath26 in an ideal tetrahedron .",
    "small  membered rings are of particular interest if one considers the reaction of a water molecule with an sio@xmath0 surface . a possible reaction mechanism which was put forward by molecular orbital calculations  @xcite implies the disruption of a si  o  si structural element followed by the formation of two silanol groups ( si  o  h ) .",
    "thereby a si  o bond has to be broken . for this reason , 2 or 3membered rings are of particular interest since these structures have a high local internal stress and hence their bonds can be broken more easily than the one in larger rings .",
    "therefore , we consider in the following the reaction of h@xmath0o molecule with a 2membered ring on a silica surface . to this end , we have selected a configuration from our bks ",
    "cpmd simulations at 300  k that exhibit exactly one two ",
    "fold ring on its surface .",
    "the initial position that we have chosen for the h@xmath0o molecule on the 2membered ring is illustrated in fig .",
    "the oxygen atom of the water molecule [ o(3 ) ] was placed at a distance of 1.52    from one of the si atoms [ si(1 ) ] which is slightly smaller than the si  o bond lengths in the ring of 1.64   .",
    "the two hydrogen atoms h(1 ) and h(2 ) were placed at a distance of 1    from o(3 ) ( and h(1 ) at a distance of 1    from o(1 ) ) such that the h(1)o(3)h(2 ) angle corresponds to 109@xmath27 .",
    "further details can be extracted from fig .",
    "we shall see in the following that the small o(1)o(3 ) distance ( 1.63    compared to 2.2    in bulk silica ) drives the breaking of a si  o bond and the formation of two silanol groups .     and potential energy @xmath28 during the interaction of the silica surface with the h@xmath0o molecule ( note the logarithmic time axis ) .",
    "the vertical dashed lines at @xmath29  ps , @xmath30  ps , and @xmath31  ps mark the times at which the snapshots in fig .  [ fig3abc ] are shown . ]",
    "( 10,30 ) ( -67,-23 ) ( -67,18 ) ( -15,-23 ) ( -15,18 ) ( 35,-23 ) ( 35,18 )    the initial condition for h@xmath0o on the two  membered rings is of course artificial and leads to enormous forces between the atoms . in order to avoid an explosion of the system we have introduced a thermostat .",
    "if the temperature becomes larger than 380  k or lower than 220  k , the velocities of the particles are rescaled such that the apparent temperature of the system is 300  k. figure  [ fig3 ] shows the potential and the total energy during the reaction whereby the time @xmath32 corresponds to the initial configuration .",
    "obviously , the potential energy decreases rapidly such that after about 0.1  ps a constant is reached .",
    "snapshots of the reaction at @xmath29  ps , @xmath30  ps , and @xmath31  ps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3abc ] ( note that @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are also marked as vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . indeed , at time @xmath35 the end configuration with two silanol groups is formed .",
    "the first step that leads to the silanol groups is the breaking of one of the h  o bonds and of the enforced o(3)o(1 ) bond .",
    "this has happened at @xmath36 whereby the potential energy is already quite close to the equilibrium value ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . in a second step",
    "then a si  o bond is broken ( see snapshot at @xmath37 ) followed by an increased separation of the two silicon atoms .",
    "( 10,10 ) ( -55,-82 ) ( 30,-54 ) ( 30,-90 )    now we want to study in more detail the formation of two silanol groups as a result of the reaction of the water molecule with a two  fold ring .",
    "this reaction can be written as follows : @xmath38    ( 10,30 ) ( -60,-78 ) ( 30,-34 ) ( 30,-68 )    in the following we will estimate the activation energy @xmath39 and also @xmath40 .",
    "a positive or negative sign of @xmath40 indicates whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic , respectively .",
    "we use again the starting configuration shown in fig .",
    "but now we completely freeze in the sio@xmath0 system and we move only the water molecule at a temperature of @xmath41  k. as the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_deltar ] shows , the potential energy is monotonously decaying while the water molecule relaxes on the surface .",
    "after about 0.1  ps a constant value of @xmath28 is reached where the water molecule has evaporated from the surface . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_deltar ] are the distances @xmath42 of the water atoms from the initial position as a function of time .",
    "we see that , slightly before the h@xmath0o evaporates , the o(3)o(1 ) distance and the o(3)si(1 ) distance are increasing while the o(3)h(1 ) distance is decreasing to the ideal o ",
    "h distance in a water molecule around 1   . of importance for the following , are the configurations at the times @xmath43  ps and @xmath44  ps ( marked as vertical dashed lines in fig .  [ fig_deltar ] ) that we will denote by sc1 and sc2 , respectively . using sc1 as a starting configuration for a cpmd run , where the whole system is again simulated at @xmath1  k , leads to the formation of two silanol groups , whereas the use of sc2 yields the evaporation of the water molecule from the surface .",
    "as we can infer from the snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig_deltar ] , the main difference between sc1 and sc2 is a slightly different o(3)h(1 ) distance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot the potential energy for the two cpmd runs starting from the configurations sc1 and sc2 . since both runs yield initially about the same value for @xmath28 we can extract both @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the plot . first , from the difference of the saturated values for @xmath45  ps ( marked as horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) we obtain @xmath46  ev which indicates that the reaction is exothermic .",
    "the activation energy @xmath39 can be estimated from the difference of the initial and the final value of the sc2 run where the water molecule evaporates from the surface . for the latter process",
    "an ho  h bond and a si  o bond have to be broken and thus the binding energy of both bonds contribute to @xmath39 . from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the value @xmath47  ev can be extracted .",
    "whereas the distances of the o  o and si  o neighbors in the two  membered ring are significantly smaller than those found in the bulk ( see above ) , the same bonds are very close to the bulk values in the final structure with the two silanol rings . moreover , the o  si  o angle in the silanol groups has a value around 108@xmath26 , i.e.  close to the value found in an ideal sio@xmath48 tetrahedron .",
    "these findings may explain the observation of an exothermic reaction .    in a recent publication , masini and",
    "bernasconi  @xcite also studied the adsorption reaction of a water molecule with a two  membered ring on an amorphous silica surface by cpmd .",
    "they find @xmath49  ev , i.e.  a value which is very similar to the one found in this work .",
    "however , they did a constrained md simulation to estimate the activation energy . as a reaction coordinate they used either the distance between a silicon atom in the ring and the oxygen atom of the water molecule ( called path a in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or the distance between an oxygen atom of the ring and a hydrogen atom of the water molecule ( called path b ) . as a result @xmath50",
    "ev is obtained for path a and @xmath51  ev for path b. in this work , we find an activation energy which is closer to path a in ref .",
    "using a combination of classical md and cpmd we have investigated the reaction of water with a free amorphous silica surface .",
    "we have seen that the reaction of a water molecule with a two  membered ring , leading to the formation of two silanol groups on the sio@xmath0 surface , is an exothermic reaction with an activation energy around 0.9  ev . that the reaction is exothermic is in agreement with other recent numerical studies , and may be explained by the change of bond lengths and angles towards values found in bulk sio@xmath0 while the silanol groups form .",
