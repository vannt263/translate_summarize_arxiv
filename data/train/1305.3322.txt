    "the most successful regularization method in understanding non - perturbative quantum field theory ( qft ) is the lattice method,@xcite which replaces space - time by a periodically arranged finite set of points .",
    "numerical simulations based on this are becoming increasingly accurate , therefore any attempt at a mathematical formulation of quantum field theory must build on this success and aim to improve upon it .",
    "the classical analogue of the problem would be the solution of partial differential equations ( pdes ) . in the early days a lattice with identically shaped fundamental regions was used in numerical solutions of pdes .",
    "later it was realized that using meshes adapted to the boundary conditions makes more economical use of computing resources by adding more points where the field varies rapidly and fewer where it varies slowly .",
    "the finite element method@xcite was developed in the seventies : it allows fundamental cells to have different shapes and sizes and use sophisticated interpolation methods to model the field in the interior of each cell .",
    "some of the mathematical ideas were anticipated by whitney@xcite in his work in topology and extended by patodi@xcite .",
    "the whitney elements have provided a basis for a discrete formulation of geometry .",
    "this discrete differential geometry is useful not only to solve pdes , but also to model shapes for use in computer graphics@xcite .",
    "the analogue in quantum field theory is to replace the periodic lattice with a mesh that contains different length scales .",
    "this approach has been looked at by groups in the past and met with varying degrees of success . the first approach in this direction was by christ , friedberg and lee@xcite ( except they proposed to average over all locations of lattice points as a way to restore rotation invariance , which did not turn out to be helpful ) .",
    "there is also some early work by bender , guralnik and sharp@xcite .",
    "patodi s fem to solve the eigenvalue problem for laplacians was not noticed by physicists at this time .",
    "since then much of the work on lattice gauge theories has been computational along with some analytic work@xcite .",
    "we propose to adapt existing methods of qft and develop new finite element methods to understand the essential problem from wilson s point of view : how to integrate out some variables and get an effective theory for the remaining degrees of freedom ( for a recent review , see the volume@xcite ) .",
    "the simplest case is the one dimensional lattice ( the set of integers ) , which has a natural subdivision into even and odd numbered elements . by integrating out the odd sites and leaving only the even sites",
    "we are left with an identical lattice with a different separation between field points .",
    "unfortunately there is no simple procedure to extend this into higher dimensions .",
    "a natural idea would be to divide space into triangles ( simplices in higher dimensions ) and to fit them together to form larger ones , allowing us to integrate out the interior vertices and obtain an effective large scale theory .",
    "an advantage of our regularization method is that the renormalization map can be calculated exactly .",
    "the transformation between the angles of the triangles from subsequent generations is obtained at each stage of the subdivision .",
    "the first examples@xcite we constructed this way ignored the shape ( information contained in the angles ) of the triangles .",
    "the finite element method used by engineers leads to a `` cotangent formula''@xcite .",
    "it approximates the laplacian in two dimensions on one hand and also happens to be a fixed point@xcite of the renormalization dynamics .",
    "we determine this dynamics explicitly .",
    "we expect this fixed point to be a continuum limit on a fractal , analogous to the bethe lattice for which the renormalization group can be exactly calculated .",
    "such qfts can serve as approximations to theories on euclidean spaces . or perhaps at short distances , space - time really is not euclidean .    if generalized to the ising model , nonlinear sigma models or to four dimensional field theories , we could get interesting examples of discrete conformal field theory@xcite . in our approach",
    "we do not average over triangulations .",
    "such an average has been proposed as an approach to quantum gravity@xcite and as a way to restore translation invariance@xcite .",
    "in the early days of computational engineering , duffin@xcite derived a formula for the discrete approximation for the energy of an electrostatic field on a planar domain . in this finite element method the plane is divided into triangles where the field is specified at each vertex and the energy of the field is the sum of contributions from each triangle .",
    "an approximation for the energy of a triangle is obtained by linear interpolation of the field to the interior .",
    "suppose the vertices @xmath0 correspond to field values @xmath1 .",
    "each point @xmath2 in the interior of the triangle divides it into three sub - triangles with vertices @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "if the ratio of the area of a sub - triangle opposite to @xmath6 to the larger triangle is @xmath7 then @xmath8    we can use the pair @xmath9 as co - ordinates instead of the cartesian components of @xmath2 .",
    "the linear interpolation of the field values to the point @xmath2 is then @xmath10    the energy of the interpolated field inside a triangle on calculation turns out to be @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the cotangents of the angles at the vertices .    ]",
    "define the vectors along the sides of the triangle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , @xmath13    using @xmath14 for @xmath15 as co - ordinates , @xmath16    then the metric tensor of the plane in these co - ordinates has as components the dot products of the sides : @xmath17    also , @xmath18 is twice the area of the triangle .",
    "the cotangents are @xmath19    then , @xmath20 and @xmath21    thus , using @xmath22 , @xmath23\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this can be rewritten as @xmath24\\ ] ] as claimed .",
    "the space @xmath25 of similarity classes of triangles ( with marked vertices ) is a hyperboloid@xcite .",
    "this can be understood in several ways .",
    "a pair of sides of a triangle forms a basis , thus the space of marked triangles may be identified with @xmath26 : this group acts transitively and without a fixed point on the space of bases .",
    "quotienting by rotation , scaling and reflection around a side gives @xmath27 which is a hyperboloid .",
    "this argument generalizes to @xmath28 dimensions : the similarity classes of marked simplices is @xmath29 .",
    "an equivalent point of view is that @xmath25 is the space of symmetric tensors of determinant one : a pair of sides of the triangles define a symmetric tensor through their inner products . by scaling",
    "we can choose this symmetric tensor to have determinant one .",
    "it is clear that @xmath30 acts on the space of such tensors transitively , with @xmath31 as the isotropy group at one point .",
    "again this generalizes to @xmath28 dimensions",
    ".    a more explicit point of view will be useful in what follows .",
    "a similarity class of marked triangles is determined by the angles at the vertices ( or , for convenience , the cotangents of the angles ) .",
    "since the angles @xmath32 of a triangle add up to @xmath33 , the cotangents satisfy @xmath34    this can be written as @xmath35 since @xmath36 has signature ( @xmath37 , this is the equation for a time - like hypersurface in minkowski space @xmath38 . setting @xmath39 the  cotangent identity \" ( [ cotangentidentity ] ) becomes the equation for a hyperboloid @xmath40 the quantity @xmath41 is the ratio of the sum of squares of the sides to the area of the triangle .",
    "it is a minimum for an equilateral triangle and becomes large for a flat triangle ( one with small area or large perimeter ) .",
    "so far we discussed triangles with marked vertices but we should also consider invariant transformations of the vertices .",
    "the group @xmath42 of permutations of vertices is generated by the cyclic permutation @xmath43 and the interchange of a pair of vertices @xmath44",
    "@xmath45    these permutations act on the cotangents through the matrices @xmath46    we can also parametrize @xmath25 by the complex number @xmath47    by a translation , we can choose the first vertex @xmath48 and by a rotation and scaling we may choose @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is then the co - ordinate of the remaining vertex .",
    "then the permutation of the vertices becomes @xmath51    by a reflection around the side @xmath52 , we can choose @xmath53 ; equivalently @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 is the reflection around the perpendicular from vertex @xmath56 to the opposite side @xmath52 of the triangle .",
    "we can subdivide a triangle into three sub - triangles of equal area by connecting the centroid @xmath57 to the vertices @xmath0 by straight lines .",
    "( if we subdivide at some other interior point , we get similar results ) .",
    "the cotangents of the angles of the sub - triangle opposite vertex @xmath56 are given by @xmath58 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    ]    to see this , choose a co - ordinate system with @xmath59 so that @xmath60 then , @xmath61    by dropping a perpendicular from @xmath62 to the side @xmath63 we get @xmath64    the remaining angle is given by solving the cotangent formula : @xmath65    we can thus express the cotangents of this sub - triangle as @xmath66 where @xmath67    note that @xmath68 since the cotangent identity is preserved . thus subdivisions are represented by lorentz transformations in @xmath38 . note the symmetry under the interchange of @xmath69 and @xmath70 : @xmath71    the cotangents of the remaining sub - triangles are given by cyclic permutations @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see fig .
