    "critical properties of compressible spin systems are traditionally subject of extensive theoretical studies , since they depend in a rather crucial and subtle way on specific constraints laid on a given compressible spin model .",
    "a vast number of theoretical studies on the compressible spin-1/2 ising planar models serves in evidence that the magnetoelastic coupling may either change a continuous ( second - order ) phase transition to a discontinuous ( first - order ) one @xcite , cause a renormalization of critical exponents in a continuous phase transition @xcite , or lead to a striking cross - over between both aforedescribed scenarios at a tricritical point @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", it is quite valuable to investigate this rather subtle inter - relationship between the critical behaviour and specific contraints laid on compressible spin systems especially with the help of exactly tractable spin models .    in the present letter",
    ", we will introduce a new class of exactly soluble ising models on decorated planar lattices ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and refernces cited therein ) in which atoms from nodal lattice sites are excluded from lattice vibrations in contrast with decorating atoms that are relaxed from a condition of perfect lattice rigidity .",
    "the lattice vibrations of the decorating atoms will be treated as quantum harmonic oscillations and will consequently lead to a presence of the competing next - nearest - neighbour interaction , which basically affects the critical behaviour of the investigated spin system whenever a relative strength of the magnetoelastic interaction exceeds some threshold value . however , our assumption on a lattice rigidity of the nodal atoms is sufficient to prevent a change in the character of a phase transition , which always turns out to be from the standard ising universality class .",
    "this letter is so organized .",
    "the investigated model is defined in section [ model ] , where the basic steps of the calculation procedure are also explained .",
    "the most interesting results for the ground - state and finite - temperature phase diagrams , the spontaneous magnetization and the specific heat are presented in section [ result ] .",
    "finally , some conclusions and future outlooks are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "let us begin by considering the spin-1/2 ising model on decorated planar lattices such as a decorated square lattice schematically depicted in fig .",
    "the decorated lattice constitute two inequivalent lattice sites to be further referred to as nodal and decorating sites , respectively , which are occupied by the nodal atoms with the ising spin @xmath0 and the decorating atoms with the ising spin @xmath1 .",
    "suppose furthermore that the nodal atoms are placed at rigid lattice positions contrary to the decorating atoms , which are relaxed from the condition of a perfect rigidity . under these circumstances",
    ", it is advisable to define the total hamiltonian of the investigated model system as a sum of bond hamiltonians , whereas each bond hamiltonian @xmath2 contains all the interaction terms of the @xmath3th decorating atom and is further divided into the magnetoelastic part @xmath4 and the pure elastic part @xmath5 @xmath6 above , @xmath7 denotes the total number of the nodal atoms and @xmath8 determines the number of their nearest neighbours .",
    "the magnetoelastic part of the bond hamiltonian @xmath9 takes into account the exchange interaction , which depends on an instantaneous distance between the decorating spin @xmath10 and its two nearest - neighbour nodal spins @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 here , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the @xmath16-component of the standard spin-1/2 operator with two respective eigenvalues @xmath17 and the coordinate operator @xmath18 is assigned to a local displacement of the @xmath3th decorating atom from its equilibrium lattice position placed in the middle in between its two nearest - neighbour nodal atoms .",
    "note that the displacement @xmath19 will be hereafter regarded to be dimensionless ( i.e. this parameter determines displacement in multipliers of some characteristic length ) , which consequently allows one to consider all the other hamiltonian parameters to be in energy units .",
    "the exchange constant @xmath20 determines a magnitude of the nearest - neighbour interaction between decorating and nodal spins provided that the decorating atom takes its equilibrium position , while the magnetoelastic ( spin - phonon ) coupling constant @xmath21 describes an appropriate decrease ( increase ) in the nearest - neighbour exchange interaction invoked by the elongation ( contraction ) of a relevant distance .    ,",
    "while the red ones denote lattice positions of the decorating atoms with the ising spin @xmath1 that are relaxed from the condition of a perfect rigidity.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the elastic part of the bond hamiltonian @xmath22 includes the kinetic energy of the @xmath3th decorating atom with the mass @xmath23 and the elastic energy penalty , which is associated with the displacement of the @xmath3th decorating atom from its equilibrium position @xmath24 it is noteworthy that the elastic part of bond hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ hal ] ) is in fact the hamiltonian of the quantum harmonic oscillator with twice as large bare elastic ( spring stiffness ) constant due to a simultaneous distortion of two harmonic springs attached to each decorating atom .",
    "it should be noted here that an interconnection between spin and lattice degrees of freedom is usually the main obstacle , which precludes an exact treatment of the lattice - statistical spin models including the spin - phonon interaction .",
    "however , our assumption on the incapability of the nodal atoms to perform lattice vibrations enables one to decouple spin and lattice degrees of freedom by making use of the local canonical coordinate transformation @xcite @xmath25 as a matter of fact , the coordinate transformation ( [ cct ] ) eliminates from the magnetoelastic part of the bond hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) dependence on a displacement operator @xmath26 which is substituted through the effective next - nearest - neighbour interaction between the nodal ising spins and the less important constant term .",
    "a presence of the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction between the nodal spins in the effective spin hamiltonian ( [ hamt ] ) implies an eventual spin frustration , which originates from the magnetoelastic coupling .",
    "by contrast , the elastic part of the bond hamiltonian ( [ hal ] ) remains unchanged under the local canonical coordinate transformation ( [ cct ] ) @xmath27 introducing standard annihilation and creation bosonic operators obeying the commutation rule @xmath28 = 1 $ ] @xmath29 allows one to bring the elastic part of the bond hamiltonian ( [ halt ] ) into the diagonal form @xmath30 which is more appropriate for further calculations .",
    "it is worthy of notice that the angular frequency of normal - mode oscillations is given by @xmath31 .",
    "now , let us proceed to a calculation of the partition function .",
    "it can be easily understood that the total partition function can be partially factorized into a product of bond partition functions , because different bond hamiltonians obviously commute with each other .",
    "in addition , the coordinate transformation ( [ cct ] ) allows one to treat the elastic and magnetic part of the bond partition function independently of each other and consequently , the partition function can be factorized into the following product @xmath32 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "( [ u ] ) by the use of well - known relation @xmath49 , but the final formula is too cumbersome to write it down here explicitly .",
    "contrary to this , the spontaneous magnetization can not be simply obtained from the mapping relation ( [ mr ] ) between the partition functions .",

    "et al_. @xcite , which establish a precise mapping equivalence between the ensemble average @xmath50 in the spin-1/2 ising model on a decorated lattice and the ensemble average @xmath51 in the corresponding spin-1/2 ising model on the undecorated rigid lattice for any function depending just on the nodal ising spins .",
    "accordingly , the uniform and staggered magnetizations of the nodal ising spins can be obtained from the mapping relations @xmath52 which connect both these quantities with the spontaneous ( either uniform or staggered ) magnetization of the corresponding spin-1/2 ising model on the undecorated rigid lattice @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "it is quite obvious from the coordinate transformation ( [ cct ] ) that the mean displacement can be expressed in terms of two spin correlation functions and the mean displacement in a new coordinate system @xmath56 it can be readily proved that both spin correlation functions between the decorating spin and its two nearest - neighbour nodal spins are identical @xmath57 and the mean displacement in a shifted coordinate system equals zero @xmath58 these results are taken to mean that the mean displacement also equals zero , i.e. @xmath59 , and the decorating atoms oscillate symmetrically around their equilibrium lattice positions . to bring an insight into a magnitude of those lattice oscillations ,",
    "let us also calculate the standard deviation for the displacement of the decorating atoms from their equilibrium lattice positions using @xmath60 the mean of a square of the displacement of the decorating atoms in a shifted coordinate system is given by @xmath61 and hence , the standard deviation for the displacement of the decorating atoms readily follows from the formula @xmath62",
    "now , let us proceed to an analysis of the most interesting results obtained in the foregoing section .",
    "although all generic features of the investigated model system will be hereafter illustrated only on a particular example of the spin-1/2 ising model on a decorated square lattice with the coordination number @xmath63 , the qualitatively same behaviour may be expected for any other decorated loose - packed planar lattice as well .",
    "it is noteworthy , moreover , that the exchange and magnetoelastic constants can be considered without loss of generality positive , because the relevant change in a character of the exchange interaction does not fundamentally affect neither the critical behaviour nor the behaviour of basic thermodynamic quantities as it merely causes a rather trivial change in a relative orientation of the decorating and nodal ising spins , respectively .",
    "last but not least , let us introduce the following set of reduced parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which measure a relative strength of the magnetoelastic constant , the spring stiffness constant , the phonon energy and the temperature , respectively .    the typical ground - state phase diagram is depicted in fig .  [ fig2 ] in the the @xmath68 plane .",
    "it turns out that the classical ferromagnetic phase ( cfp ) with a perfect parallel alignment of all nodal as well as decorating spins constitutes the ground state when the magnetoelastic coupling is smaller than the boundary value @xmath69 . on the other hand ,",
    "the more striking frustrated antiferromagnetic phase ( fap ) becomes the ground state whenever the magnetoelastic coupling exceeds the boundary value @xmath70 .",
    "the spin arrangement inherent to fap can be characterized by a remarkable coexistence of a partial order and disorder , since the perfect antiferromagnetic ( nel ) long - range order of the nodal spins is accompanied with a complete disorder of the decorating spins .",
    "an origin of this rather unexpected and unusual phase apparently lies in the spin - phonon coupling induced spin frustration , which manifest itself in the competing character of the next - nearest - neighbour interaction between the nodal spins in the effective spin hamiltonian ( [ hamt ] ) and leads to a frustration of the decorating spins .",
    "plane.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to bring an insight into how the phase transition between cfp and fap manifest itself in the lattice vibrations of the decorating atoms , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] displays the zero - temperature dependence of the standard deviation on a relative strength of the magnetoelastic constant . even though the decorating atoms oscillate symmetrically around their equilibrium lattice positions both in cfp and fap",

    "[ fig3 ] that the magnitude of these lattice oscillations are much more robust in fap than cfp . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the standard deviation does not depend on the magnetoelastic constant within the region corresponding to cfp where @xmath71 while it jumps towards a higher value at @xmath72 and then increases monotonically with the magnetoelastic constant within the region corresponding to fap where @xmath73 from this point of view , our further analysis will be restricted only to a discussion of the particular cases with a sufficiently small value of the ratio @xmath74 between the magnetoelastic and spring stiffness constants in order to keep a magnitude of lattice oscillations within the range of validity of the harmonic approximation .",
    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    now , let us proceed to a discussion of the critical behaviour . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the critical temperature is plotted against a relative strength of the magnetoelastic constant for several values of the spring stiffness constant .",
    "the critical temperature of cfp gradually decreases by increasing the magnetoelastic coupling until it completely vanishes at the ground - atate boundary between cfp and fap . on the contrary",
    ", one may observe a rather steep increase of the critical temperature upon further increase of the magnetoelastic coupling in fap , which can be mainly attributed to a quadratic dependence of the antiferromagnetic part of the effective interaction ( [ mp1 ] ) on the magnetoelastic constant .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall , however , that the validity of our results for the critical temperatures of fap is restricted only to a rather narrow region in a close vicinity of the ground - state phase boundary between cfp and fap , where the standard deviation is small enough to ensure the validity of harmonic approximation .",
    "next , let us turn our attention to temperature dependences of the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "[ fig5](a ) shows typical thermal variations of both spontaneous sublattice magnetizations in cfp for three different values of the magnetoelastic constant .",
    "the sublattice magnetization @xmath54 of the nodal ising spins is always more resistent to thermal fluctuations than the sublattice magnetization @xmath53 of the decorating ising spins even if both sublattice magnetizations tend to zero with the same critical exponent @xmath75 from the standard ising universality class .",
    "it is worthy to notice , moreover , that the difference in the thermal behaviour of both sublattice magnetizations is the smaller , the stronger is a relative strength of the magnetoelastic constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the relevant order parameter for partially ordered and partially disordered fap represents the staggered magnetization @xmath76 of the nodal ising spins , while the decorating ising spins remain disordered over the whole temperature range in fap .",
    "the typical temperature variations of the staggered magnetization of the nodal ising spins are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",

    "[ fig6 ] illustrates two typical thermal dependences of the specific heat for cfp , while fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] depicts another two typical temperature dependences of the specific heat for fap . to gain a deeper insight into the overall behaviour , both lattice as well as magnetic part of the specific heat",

    "another interesting non - monotonic thermal dependence of the specific heat with the @xmath78-type singularity superimposed on a round shoulder can be detected in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , where the magnetic and phonon contributions to the overall heat capacity are even better separated one from each other due to a relevant decrease in the critical temperature caused by an enhancement of the magnetoelastic coupling .",

    "[ fig7](a)-(b ) illustrate typical thermal dependences of the specific heat in fap , where a substantial shift in the critical temperature can be achieved by a rather small increase in a relative strength of the magnetoelastic constant . in this particular case",
    ", the lattice contribution to the overall heat capacity may prevail over the magnetic contribution even in the low - temperature region and hence , the @xmath78-type singularity can be superimposed either on the ascending part ( fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) ) or the saturated part ( fig .  [ fig7](b ) ) of the lattice specific heat .",
    "thus , the round shoulder in the low - temperature tail of the specific heat observed in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) obviosly comes from the phonon rather than magnetic excitations .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark , moreover , that a few other types of dependences mostly with a rather well separated magnetic and lattice contributions can be achieved by varying the phonon energy and the spring stiffness constant , however , our particular attention was mainly concentrated on special cases with an obvious interplay between both contributions .    , but for the magnetoelastic constant : ( a ) @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath84.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] , but for the magnetoelastic constant : ( a ) @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath84.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "the present letter deals with the magnetoelastic properties of the spin-1/2 ising model with a spin - phonon coupling on decorated planar lattices partially prone to lattice vibrations , which are investigated by making use of the generalized decoration - iteration transformation and the harmonic approximation . within the framework of this approach",
    ", we have examined the ground - state and finite - temeprature phase diagrams , the mean and standard deviation of the displacement of the decorating atoms from their equilibrium lattice positions , as well as , the temperature dependences of the spontaneous magnetization and the specific heat .",
