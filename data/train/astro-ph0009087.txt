    "t  tauri stars ( tts ) are low - mass ( m  @xmath3  3  m@xmath4 ) pre - main sequence stars which are normally younger than 3  @xmath5  10@xmath6 years ( appenzeller & mundt @xcite ) .",
    "they are of great interest as prototypes of young solar - type stars .",
    "historically two sub - groups of tts were defined , based on the strength of the h@xmath0  spectral line emission : classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) with strong h@xmath0  emission and weak ( or `` naked '' ) t  tauri stars ( wtts ) .",
    "the enhanced activity of most ctts as seen from the balmer and metallic ( permitted and forbidden ) line emission is believed to be due to the presence of an accretion disk , whose uv and ir excess emission causes also broad energy distributions .",
    "+ since the first studies of their line profiles it has been known that ctts spectra show evidence of outflows ( e.g. herbig @xcite ) .",
    "more recently also abundant observational evidence of funnel accretion flows onto ctts has been published ( e.g. edwards et al .",
    "@xcite ) . +",
    "knigl ( @xcite ) proposed the application of the ghosh & lamb ( @xcite ) magnetospheric model , developed for accreting neutron stars , to explain the interaction between ctts and their accretion disk .",
    "the accretion disk is disrupted at a few stellar radii from the central star ( close to the co - rotation radius ) by the presence of a stellar dipole magnetic field . according to shu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and paatz & camenzind ( @xcite ) , at the truncation point , the ionized disk material is loaded either onto inner closed magnetic field lines , accreting thereby onto the stellar surface , or it is loaded onto outer open magnetic field lines that can drive a disk - wind flow .",
    "+ recently , some observational support for the magnetospheric models was presented by johns - krull et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and guenther et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who measured kilogauss magnetic fields at the surface of ctts , enough to effectively disrupt the accretion disk at a few stellar radii .",
    "the assumption of a stellar dipole magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis completely determines the geometry and dynamics of the disk - star interaction . according to the magnetospheric models mentioned previously ,",
    "the magnetosphere is axi - symmetric with respect to the rotational axis so no rotational modulation is expected in the wind and accretion signatures , unless the disk is inhomogeneous at the truncation radius .",
    "furthermore , variations in the inflow and outflow signatures should be approximately in phase .",
    "but a stellar magnetic field that has solely a dipolar component is unlikely and this type of models has been criticised ( safier @xcite ; alencar & basri @xcite ) .",
    "the evidence for magnetospheric accretion exists ( hot spots and redshifted absorption features ) , but theoretical models are still far from explaining the variety of observations .",
    "has been classified as a ctts ( e.g. bouvier et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but also as the prototype of a separate class of t tauri stars , the su  aur type stars ( herbig & bell @xcite ) .",
    "su  aur has a g2 spectral type ( herbig @xcite ) , thus , due to the contrast with a hotter photosphere , only h@xmath0 , and occasionally h@xmath1 , appear in emission in the spectrum .",
    "has an exceptionally high projected rotational velocity of 60  km  s@xmath7  ( johns - krull @xcite ; unruh et al .",

    "photometric period measurements for su  aur are very difficult to make . for instance , bouvier et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found multiple periods , with 2.78  days the most likely period .",
    "so far the best period estimates come from the analysis of the spectral variations of the balmer lines .",
    "giampapa et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found a period of 2.98  @xmath8  0.4  days in the blue wing of the h@xmath0  line , later confirmed also in the blue and red wings of h@xmath1  by johns & basri ( @xcite ) .",
    "petrov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) reported a period of 3.031  @xmath8  0.003  days measured on the red wings of the balmer lines .",
    "our data set suggests a shorter rotational period of about 2.6 to 2.8  days ( unruh et al .",
    "@xcite ) .      from period analysis and",
    "equivalent width measurements of fitted components in h@xmath0  and h@xmath1 , johns & basri ( @xcite ) observed that the h@xmath1  redshifted absorption feature and the h@xmath0  blueshifted absorption feature ( respectively accretion and wind signatures ) show a periodicity of about 3  days and are approximately @xmath9 out of phase in su  aur .",
    "this led them to propose a generalization of the magnetospheric model , in which the rotational axis and the magnetic dipole axis are ( slightly ) misaligned : the misaligned `` egg - beater '' or oblique rotator model .",
    "it predicts that the signatures of mass accretion and disk winds should be rotationally modulated and approximately in anti - phase , as they observed in su  aur .",
    "+ using h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 ,  d and  d3 , we try to disentangle the two main contributions present in the line profiles , namely accretion and wind signatures .",
    "these lines probe different parts of the circumstellar environment .",
    "thus , the temporal relation between the variability in the different lines depends on the geometry and physical conditions of the circumstellar environment , in particular of the inner disk and magnetosphere .",
    "for instance , variations in the accretion rate at the inner disk or outer magnetosphere will first affect low excitation energy features arising in this region .",
    "the higher energy lines that form in the inner accretion stream or in the accretion shock will be affected by this `` perturbation '' after a time lag related to the infall time through the magnetosphere .",
    "this delay is expected to be of the order of several hours ( smith et al .",
    "@xcite ) . +",
    "previous su  aur data sets typically had one to two spectra a night , even though over long time spans .",
    "our data set , with finer time sampling , allows us for the first time to study the variations of the different components in spectral lines on short timescales . in the context of the magnetospheric model and using cross - correlation techniques , we have searched for time lags between the variability of the mentioned spectral lines . in sect .",

    "the musicos ( multi - site continuous spectroscopy ) network was created to provide continuous spectroscopic coverage for stellar objects , whose variability timescales demand simultaneous coverage from several longitudes ( catala & foing @xcite ; catala et al .",
    "@xcite ; catala & foing @xcite ) . to fulfill this aim ,",
    "existing observational capabilities were used or dedicated instruments were developed . a musicos campaign is organized every two years and several stellar targets are selected for each campaign . + our data set was obtained in november  1996 during the musicos  96 multi - wavelength campaign , that involved five different observatories : isaac newton telescope ( int , la palma ) , observatoire de haute provence ( ohp , france ) , mcdonald observatory ( mdo , usa ) , beijing astronomical observatory ( bao , xinglong , china ) and canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht , hawaii ) .",
    "we obtained 126 echelle spectra of su  aur , spanning 10.5  days , with 3.5  days covered almost continuously .",
    "h@xmath0 ,  d and  d3 were observed at all five observatories while h@xmath1  could only be observed from the int , ohp and cfht .",
    "thus , for this line , we obtained only 72 spectra .",
    "the data from the different observatories were rebinned to a uniform resolution of 30  000 , or approximately 10  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the journals of the observations and more details about this campaign and data reduction can be found in unruh et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we highlight in this subsection the main characteristics of the variability in our data set .",
    "the period analysis was performed by unruh et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they computed the periodograms of the above mentioned spectral lines ( see figures in unruh et al .",
    "we independently determined the following periods : 2.63  days in  d3 [ @xmath1075:175 ]  km  s@xmath7 and in the red wings of  d [ 30:150 ]  km  s@xmath7 , and 2.80  days in the red wing of h@xmath1 [ 50:175 ]  km  s@xmath7 and in the far blue wing of h@xmath0 [ @xmath10375:@xmath10175 ]  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this might indicate that the regions of formation of these lines are not strictly in co - rotation .",
    "however , the peaks in the periodograms are fairly broad , thus these periods are all consistent with a single periodicity , between 2.5 and 3  days . + in the periodogram of h@xmath0 , and less conspicuously in the periodograms of h@xmath1  and  d , there is a broad peak at about 5  days that we believe to be related to the flux enhancement observed in h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 at roughly the middle of the time series ( sect .  3.2 ) .",
    "we have computed the periodograms of the spectral lines , removing the spectra affected by this flux enhancement .",
    "we confirm our period determinations and , in fact , the peak at 5  days vanishes .",

    "these appear in the variance profiles of these lines as the peaks between @xmath11 and @xmath12  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "small mismatches in the wavelength calibration between the different sites and the rebinning of the data cause the narrow features in the  d variance profile at the position of the interstellar absorption lines .",
    "+ the average profile of  d3 is very asymmetric and appears to be formed by two components , one at rest velocity and a redshifted component ( fig .",
    "the rest component is obtained , in a crude decomposition , by reflecting the blue wing of the average profile about zero velocity .",
    "the redshifted component is isolated by subtracting this reflection from the average profile .",
    "this component is centered at approximately 83  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the two components are broader than 2  @xmath5  v @xmath13 i and the redshifted component extends at least until 200  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the spectrum of su  aur is rich in spectral lines thought to originate from the circumstellar environment of the star .",
    "the balmer lines , h@xmath0  and h@xmath1 , the  d and  d3 lines , due to their different physical properties , probe different parts of the circumstellar material .",
    "furthermore , in these lines mingle several different components : giampapa et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and johns & basri ( @xcite ) proposed that the profiles of , respectively , h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  could be decomposed in the contributions of an enhanced chromosphere , and a slow and a fast wind components .",
    "+ the total time span of our data set allows us to sample variability related to rotational modulation . with our fine time sampling",
    ", we also expect to characterize variability on much shorter time scales , for instance arising from the inner magnetosphere .",
    "we intend to analyse how variability propagates through the different spectral lines . in our analysis of these complex profiles , we chose the cross - correlation function that expresses how the correlation coefficient between two time series varies with the time delay between them .",
    "+ cross - correlation techniques have been widely used in variability studies of active galactic nuclei ( white & peterson @xcite ) .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) applied this method to the equivalent width of the balmer and h  &  k lines for several t  tauri stars , including su  aur , but their low - resolution spectra did not allow to disentangle the different components that mingle in those spectral lines .",
    "this technique was also previously used , for instance , in johns & basri ( @xcite ) for the analysis of h@xmath0  in several ctts ( also su  aur ) and johns - krull & basri ( @xcite ) for the analysis of several lines in another tts .",
    "+ we calculated the cross - correlation function ( @xmath2 ) of pairs of spectral lines as a function of the time lag @xmath14 as well as the auto - correlation functions ( @xmath15 ) . in appendix",
    "a we define the @xmath2 and describe its implementation for our type of time series , as well as the error analysis .      using the technique described in appendix  a , we computed for each pair of spectral lines a cross - correlation function intensity map that allows a first glimpse at the time lag information contained in the time series .",
    "these maps were calculated for each pair of spectral lines for lags multiple of 0.25  days ( 6  h ) . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we present the most striking examples of the results we obtained .",
    "each column in this figure represents the @xmath2 computed at three representative time lags : 0 , @xmath16  p/2 and @xmath16  p , where p is the rotational period , taken to be approximately 2.75  days .",
    "it can be seen that the periodicity in the spectral lines is reflected in the behaviour of the @xmath2s with time lag .",
    "the @xmath2s vary from high positive correlation coefficient to high negative correlation coefficient in a periodic way ( e.g. fig .",
    "these maps illustrate the time relation between the different spectral lines ( oliveira et al .",
    "the red wing of h@xmath1  seems to vary approximately in phase with the red wings of h@xmath0  and  d ( fig .",

    "furthermore , the blue and red wings of h@xmath1  seem out of phase ( fig .",
    "+ these kind of maps can not be used to determine time lags with enough precision .",
    "their computation is too time consuming to be a viable tool for a finer analysis with better time sampling .",
    "therefore we have decided to choose and isolate velocity bins in the spectral lines that are representative of the profiles variations .",
    "we selected coherent velocity domains by analysing the @xmath15 for each spectral line .",

    "the blue and red wings seem to vary independently ; we have thus chosen two velocity bins : @xmath1030  km  s@xmath7  and 75  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the profile of  d3 varies as a whole within the interval [ @xmath1075:150 ]  km  s@xmath7 .",

    "+ the h@xmath0  intensity variations clearly show the flux enhancement seen both in the blue and red wings of the profile .",
    "the enhancement lasted for a minimum of 2  days , and the peak intensity occurs at about t  =  9  days .",

    "the central absorption feature ( @xmath19  km  s@xmath7 ) shows , from t  @xmath16  12 onwards , the presence of the second transient features ( see sect .  5 ) . in the h@xmath0  flux variations there are hardly any visible traces of the @xmath16  3  day periodicity .",
    "+ the analysis of the flux enhancement in h@xmath1  is more complicated as there are fewer data points .",
    "still , the flux enhancement can also be seen , causing variations of @xmath20  % in the far blue wing and @xmath21  % in the red wing . in the red wing of h@xmath1 ,",
    "the @xmath16  3  day periodicity can be seen and in the slightly blueshifted absorption feature there are some indications of this too . furthermore , the quasi anti - phase behaviour of these two parts of the h@xmath1  profile can be observed .",
    "the variations of the far blue wing of h@xmath1 , with the exception of the flux enhancement , show no relation with the variations in the rest of the profile .",

    "the variations are not sinusoidal but the periodic deepening of the absorption features is clear .",
    "the behaviour of the blue and red wings of  d1 seems anti - correlated .",
    "+ in order to clarify and compare more easily the variability of the four velocity bins where signatures of periodicity were seen , we folded in time the intensity variations of h@xmath1  at 100  km  s@xmath7 ,  d1 at 75  km  s@xmath7 and  d3 at 0 and 83  km  s@xmath7 .",

    "the situation is more ambiguous as there is a large bulk emission whose origin is uncertain .",
    "still , the redshifted absorption component in h@xmath0  is probably also related with the accretion flow , but at larger distances from the star , and the time lags we observe are consistent with this . + the time lags we determined suggest that a perturbation is seen in succession in the central absorption component in  d3 , in the red wing of  d and the redshifted component of  d3 , the red wing of h@xmath1  and finally the red wing of h@xmath0 .",
    "we should emphasize two things .",
    "first , these absorption features do not appear at the high velocities characteristic of free - fall .",
    "this is consistent with viewing su  aur close to edge - on , i.e.  under a small angle with the plane of the disk : hence the line - of - sight always makes a considerable angle with the base of the accretion flow probably at high latitudes on the star .",
    "second , the time - lagged behaviour that we observe can not be due to time - variable ( non - steady ) accretion , because in that case the lines that form closer to the disk would be affected first and that is the reverse of what we observe . in the oblique magnetospheric model ,",
    "the column density of the accreting matter seen in absorption against the star varies with the viewing phase of the system : at a certain phase we look through the densest parts of the accretion flow , whilst half a rotation later the densest parts are no longer seen in front of the star ( see johns & basri @xcite ) . in this scenario",
    "no time - lagged behaviour will be observed if the magnetosphere co - rotates with the star as a solid axi - symmetric body , due to the radial alignment of the regions of formation of the different spectral lines .",
    "+ smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found a similar sequence of increasing time lags for decreasing balmer series , on one night of observations , that they attribute to an accretion stream and shock seen as they moved over the limb of the star .",
    "however , any such occultation effects will be time - symmetric : if the ingress of a region of enhanced column density is seen subsequentially in spectral lines of different excitation conditions , then the reverse sequence is seen for the egress of that region . as a result , although the duration of eclipse may differ from line to line , the time of mid - eclipse will be equal for all spectral lines .",
    "similarly , the inner regions of the densest part of the accretion flow appear longer in front of the star than the outer regions , but the times of mid - transit are the same . + we propose that the time - lagged behaviour that we observe may occur if the anchors of the magnetic field lines in the star have a higher rotation rate than those in the inner disk . then the field lines and hence the accretion flow are no longer radial and the time symmetry for ingress / egress of transit ( or occultation ) events is broken : mid - transit ( or mid - eclipse ) will occur at different times for spectral lines formed at different distances to the star , causing the observed time lags .",
    "this seems also to be supported by a possible increase of modulation period with distance from the star ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) , suggesting that the inner parts of the accretion disk are rotating slower than the stellar surface .",
    "thus there is an external torque working on the magnetosphere that would wind up the magnetic field lines .",
    "apparently an equilibrium is established between the external torque and the magnetic pressure contained in the azimuthally distorted magnetic field ( see below ) .",
    "it would also hint at a somewhat smaller stellar rotation period of p  @xmath32  days , more easily reconciled with a smaller stellar radius than the usually adopted r@xmath33  r@xmath4 , which is also suggested by recent modelling of the spectral energy distribution ( oliveira et al .",
    "+ a time lag @xmath34  1.67  day separates the variations in the absorption features in the red and blue wing of h@xmath1 . a slightly bigger time lag ( 1.77  days )",
    "is observed between the blue absorption feature in h@xmath1  and the  d3 line .",
    "both the blueshifted absorption features in h@xmath0  and  d show similar lagged behaviour ( time lags of respectively 1.90 and 1.88  day ) with respect to  d3 . in the scenario of the magnetospheric models , these blueshifted absorption features are wind indicators .",
    "thus , the signatures of accretion and disk winds are out of phase .",
    "our @xmath2 calculations indicate a phase shift of about 240@xmath35 , but , as it can see from table  [ t1 ] , the peaks are broad and their amplitude relatively small , so this value is very uncertain .",
    "we have investigated several magnetospheric models that appear in the literature and address the issue of differential rotation in magnetosphere and disk .",
    "some models that approach the problem of magnetospheric accretion from the point of view of spin - up / spin - down of the young stars and jet formation are reviewed in goodson & winglee ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they all consider the case of strong magnetic fields ( i.e. there is disk truncation ) and the physical distinction between them comes from the effective value of magnetic diffusion in the disk . in these models ,",
    "the different rotation rates of the star and the disk cause the field lines that permeate the disk to become azimuthally twisted and a toroidal component of the magnetic field is created .",
    "the ability of the disk to counteract this toroidal component is described by the effective magnetic diffusivity .",
    "+ for the most diffusive flows , no wrapping up of the magnetic field lines occurs because the field lines can continuously slip through the disk .",
    "this is the case for the ghosh & lamb ( @xcite ) and the shu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) models . according to ghosh & lamb all the field lines",
    "are closed and they thread the disk up to distant radii . in the shu et al .",
    "model the closed field lines thread only a small , nearly uniformly rotating , region of the disk and outside this region there are open magnetic field lines . + for low magnetic diffusivity , differential rotation between the disk and the star makes the magnetic field lines wrap up and open via a mechanism known as inflation ( lovelace et al .",
    "the inner edge of the disk undergoes oscillations and magnetic reconnection occurs causing accretion episodes ; no steady configuration is possible ( goodson & winglee @xcite ) .",
    "+ for intermediate diffusivity , once inflation opens the outer magnetic field lines , a steady state can be attained .",
    "the inner magnetic field lines remain closed and approximately in co - rotation with the star .",
    "the plasma in the disk can move radially inwards until it reaches the point where steady accretion occurs ( lovelace et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this last scenario",
    ", it is plausible that the closed magnetic field lines are azimuthally deformed .",
    "+ the time - lagged behaviour that we observe in su  aur suggests a quasi - steady configuration , in which the magnetic field lines are azimuthally curved as a result of the magnetic field line anchors being dragged by , but slipping through the inner disk that is rotating somewhat slower than the magnetic field line anchors on the stellar surface .",
    "the misalignment of rotation and magnetic axes introduces , at certain phases , an extra magnetic pressure component in the plane of the disk , that eases the loading of the closed magnetic field lines with matter from outside the co - rotation radius .",
    "+ but how do the outflows relate with this proposed scenario ?",
    "our proposed scenario includes open field lines that can drive wind flows ( as suggested by shu et al .",
    "we have found that the signatures of accretion and disk winds are about 240@xmath35 out of phase .",
    "this agrees with the suggestion of johns & basri ( @xcite ) ( confirmed by petrov et al .",
    "@xcite ) if their picture of the oblique rotator is refined to include azimuthally curved magnetic field lines .",
    "two transient absorption features were detected in the blue wings of the profiles of h@xmath0 , h@xmath1  and  d ( unruh et al .",
    "@xcite ) . we did not pursue a multi - component analysis of these lines ( as done in giampapa et al .",
    "@xcite , johns & basri @xcite or oliveira & foing @xcite ) due to the optical thickness of the emission and the complexity and dynamics of the profiles .",
    "we could however isolate the transient features in the spectra by applying an adequate filtering procedure .",
    "the velocity position of the features is determined by detecting the minimum ( in a chosen velocity interval ) in the difference spectra with respect to the median - filtered spectra . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , the velocity evolution of these features is plotted ( features  a and b ) . there is no considerable change in the width / depth of the features , but these measurements are very difficult to carry out due to the intrinsic variability of the underlying profile . + feature  a persisted for about 1.6  days .",
    "it drifted from approximately @xmath10140 to @xmath1090 km  s@xmath7  in h@xmath0  and from @xmath10110 to @xmath1070 km  s@xmath7  in  d1 . in h@xmath1",
    "we can not identify the velocity position of the feature unambiguously and so the minimum detection was more uncertain . however , there are indications that @xmath36v(h@xmath0)@xmath36  @xmath37  @xmath36v(h@xmath1)@xmath36  @xmath37  @xmath36v()@xmath36 .",
    "the velocity evolution in the three lines follows parallel tracks in time .",
    "the onset of the feature  a is simultaneous with the flux enhancement observed in h@xmath0 and h@xmath1  ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) . + approximately 4  days after the onset of feature  a , another transient feature was detected in h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  but no counterpart was seen in the  d lines ( feature b in fig .  [ f6 ] ) .",
    "feature  b may therefore originate in regions higher in the magnetosphere that contribute little to the  d line formation . in h@xmath0",
    "this feature drifted from @xmath10140 to @xmath1080  km  s@xmath7 and seems to be decaying after 3 days when our time series ends .",
    "in contrast to what we observe for feature  a , the velocity position of feature  b in h@xmath1  is practically the same as in h@xmath0 .",
    "we stress that feature  b is more conspicuous in h@xmath1 . in the case of feature",
    "b it is rather difficult to be certain if it is an absorption or emission transient , or a combination of both .",
    "we propose that the first transient absorption feature might be plasma ejected upward , that condenses and afterwards decelerates under the influence of gravity , causing the observed velocity evolution .",
    "we have investigated several scenarios that could cause such velocity evolution .",
    "a blob of matter moving at constant velocity , in which case the velocity variation would be just the result of angular projection , is ruled out because it could not cause the velocity difference between the lines .",
    "the same problem is faced when postulating a blob that departs from the stellar surface with the escape velocity and then decelerates .",
    "the observed offset between the initial velocities of the lines indicates radially elongated material that underwent an acceleration outwards by an as yet unidentified mechanism , before it started to decelerate . for the second transient feature",
    "the velocity evolution shows no evidence of any initial acceleration .",
    "still , as for the first feature , the velocity evolution strongly suggests deceleration even though the dispersion is very large .",
    "+ we investigated several types of solar - like phenomena that could have similar characteristics .",
    "post - flare loops or surges are out of consideration because , although the matter is initially accelerated and condenses , it then falls back to the solar surface and would thus appear as redshifted absorption features , not blueshifted as we observe .",
    "such redshifted absorption components have been detected on other stars though , e.g. ( foing et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ( houdebine et al .",
    "@xcite ) and were proposed to be the analogue of post - flare loops .",
    "+ if the deceleration measured for feature  a is interpreted as gravitational deceleration of material , then a fit to that deceleration rate indicates a location of the decelerating matter at approximately 7 to 8  r@xmath38 .",
    "it is difficult to explain a column of material progressing at such distances from the star , specially without knowledge of its previous evolution .",
    "+ feature  a might be the line - of - sight absorption of material of a large scale coronal mass ejection , in a configuration sometimes called a halo mass ejection .",
    "similar to what is believed to happen in the sun and flare stars ( foing @xcite ; houdebine et al .",
    "@xcite ) , a disruption of the magnetic field lines , perhaps near the truncation radius , might cause a `` forward '' mass ejection , away from the star , that cools and condenses and is observed as transient absorption features , and a `` backwards '' release of matter / energy , that can hit the star and cause the balmer brightening we observe . in the case of su",
    "aur , these ejections clearly point at a magnetospheric connection between the star and the disk where magnetic stresses and energy build up and are released sporadically . to reproduce the time evolution of the flare ,",
    "as seen in the balmer brightening , ( peak at day  9.1 , fig .  [ f3 ] ) and of the decelerated absorption component ( start at day  8 , fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) , we suggest that the primary instability and energy release did not occur at the stellar surface or in the lower atmosphere , but rather at high altitude in the interacting magnetosphere between the star and the disk . for the second absorption feature , a similar scenario would apply , but without a visible detection of a flare .",
    "+ the events that we observed are very likely triggered by magnetic field disruption , perhaps in the context of sheared magnetic field lines as described in the previous section .",
    "the energy released during these events , in combination with more continuous energy release from magnetic field reconfiguration , might explain the especially high x - ray luminosity of su  aur ( skinner & walter @xcite ) .",
    "the circumstellar environments of ctts are extremely interesting for studying the interaction between the star and the disk .",
    "the ctts line profiles are very complex and diverse , as both accretion and outflows play a role in their formation . in this paper",
    "we try to disentangle to some extent these effects , by analysing h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 ,  d and  d3 , in an attempt to constrain the geometry and dynamics of the magnetosphere .",
    "+ the  d3 line in su  aur has two components . their variability is slightly time - lagged , indicating spatially displaced regions of formation .",
    "the component at rest velocity can be formed close to or at the stellar surface , for instance in the post - shock region , and the redshifted component in the accretion column .",
    "we propose that the redshifted component of  d3 , the red wings of  d and the redshifted absorption features in h@xmath1  and h@xmath0  are all formed in the accretion funnel , at different distances from the star according to their opacities and excitation conditions . we find different time lags between these lines , with the variability of the lines closer to the star preceding the variability in the outer spectral lines .",
    "we argue that such behaviour can not be caused by non - steady accretion , nor by simple occultation effects in an oblique magnetospheric model .",
    "we propose that such time - lagged behaviour can only occur if the magnetic field lines in the oblique magnetosphere have an azimuthal component .",
    "+ we find that the near blue wings of h@xmath0 , h@xmath1  and  d ( wind indicators ) are out of phase with the accretion indicators , though not exactly in anti - phase .",
    "+ we observe two transient absorption features in the blue wings of h@xmath0 , h@xmath1  and  d. the velocity evolution of the first feature indicates matter to be initially accelerated ( different velocities for the different lines ) .",
    "subsequent evolution suggests a deceleration or a projection effect .",
    "we propose that these features are the signature of plasma outflow events , powered by the disruption of the distorted magnetic field lines .",

    "the obvious problem is that our time series is unevenly spaced , so this definition has to be adapted .",
    "+ there are two methods to circumvent this difficulty : the _ interpolation method _ and the _ discrete correlation function_. in the first method ( gaskell & peterson @xcite ) , the @xmath2 is calculated twice for each time lag @xmath14 : the observed points l@xmath26(t@xmath47 are correlated with the interpolated values of l@xmath27(t@xmath48 and the observed points l@xmath27(t@xmath47 are correlated with the interpolated values l@xmath26(t@xmath49 .",

    "the cross - correlation function is computed at each time lag using only real data points separated by @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting correlation function is then binned on intervals @xmath51 t so that the calculated value at time lag @xmath14 is an average over the interval @xmath52t/2 .",
    "+ these methods were found to be in good agreement for well sampled data sets with a large number of data points ( white & peterson @xcite , henceforth wp , and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath50 method is more general in the sense that it makes no assumptions on the nature of the time series that we are sampling .",
    "when using the interpolation method , it is assumed implicitly that the sampled time series vary smoothly on the time scales that correspond to the intervals between observations .",
    "still , the @xmath50 will require more points than the interpolation method to give a meaningful result and , in the limit of poor sampling , will more easily fail to give a significant lag .",
    "therefore , for our data set we decided that the _ interpolation method _ is more adequate and hence used this in the calculations presented in this paper .      when calculating the @xmath2 for several types of test functions with the same time sampling as our data points , we realised that the calculations yielded @xmath2 peak values above unity .",
    "there was clearly a normalization problem in the calculation of the @xmath2 . for stationary time",
    "series , the mean and variance of the sample are invariant in time ; only in this situation it is valid to calculate @xmath44 and @xmath45 using the entire time series .",
    "we have concluded that this is not always a reasonable assumption : in fact , in our data set there was a strong flux enhancement in the spectral lines ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) , so clearly these statistical quantities change in time .",

    ". we also use linear interpolation of the data points ( wp ) .",
    "as it is mentioned above , the interpolation assumes that the times series vary smoothly between the sampled data points . in our time",

    "we have computed the @xmath2 both including and excluding these points and we concluded that the @xmath2 peaks are much sharper in the last case .",
    "so we have excluded those data points from @xmath2 calculation , even though we still use them for the calculation of the interpolated series .",
    "we should point out that the number of points used is only decreased to n@xmath104 .",
    "+ as we have mentioned the sampling of h@xmath1  is worse : we have only 72 h@xmath1  spectra against 126 for the remaining lines .",
    "the calculated @xmath2(@xmath14 ) is an average quantity if there is no reason to favour one of the interpolations .",
    "but if we are interpolating h@xmath1  and h@xmath0 , for example , it is clear that the interpolation of the h@xmath0  series is better because it is computed with more data points .",

    "we assume that the noise in our time series has a gaussian distribution .",
    "we use the standard deviation of the continuum as a conservative estimate of the noise in the spectral lines .",
    "we computed the @xmath2 with a sampling step of @xmath56  day ( approximately half of the maximum exposure time in the time series ) .",
    "we used 1000 trials for the simulations .",
