    "the inception point in the study of topological phases in condensed matter systems is the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) . since the hall conductivity is odd under time - reversal symmetry ( trs )",
    ", the topologically non - trivial states will only occur when trs is broken .",
    "the connection between the observed quantized hall conductance and topology is made through the calculation of the chern number which , in the context of the iqhe , corresponds to the number of chiral edge states present and is a global quantity contributed by all of the occupied states in the system@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the vast majority of topological band insulator states that have been experimentally confirmed@xcite , are stabilized by the _ presence _ of trs in which strong spin - orbit interactions invert the bands which allows the creation of a mass boundary @xcite that traps surface or edge states at the interface of two bulk band insulators or that of a bulk insulator and vacuum , commonly referred to as topological insulators ( ti ) . while the theory associated with trs ti is well understood , the presence of trs in a material significantly constrains the number of potential topological materials .",
    "therefore , it is important to go beyond the well - established paradigm of non - interacting time - reversal symmetric ti to look for novel topological phases .",
    "to do so , one must generalize the theory of topological classification to encompass a wider spectrum of materials@xcite .    of the materials not covered in the standard theory of trs ti , one of the most interesting classes are magnetic materials .",
    "the established theory for trs insulators can not be applied to classify any magnetic materials as their ground states break trs .",
    "ferromagnetically ordered materials have been explored theoretically as their broken symmetry leads to the the possible condensed matter realization of weyl fermions@xcite .",
    "( while the magnetic structure studied in ref .",
    "[ ] has zero total magnetization , we still refer to it as ferromagnetism because of the unbroken translational symmetry . ) yet , to this point , there has been comparatively little work on antiferromagnetically ordered materials .",
    "a pioneering work by mong , essin and moore@xcite showed that a new @xmath1-index can be defined in an antiferromagnet where the unit cell is doubled by the magnetic structure , such that while both time - reversal and translation along a primitive basis vector are broken , their combination is preserved .",
    "the spin structure in these insulators can be seen as sets of ferromagnetically ordered 2d planes of spins with alternating magnetization , stacked along a crystal direction @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "nevertheless , real magnetic materials usually exhibit more complex magnetic structures , e.g. , having non - collinear configurations as spiral magnetism , having a very large magnetic unit cell ( small propagation vectors ) or having more than one propagation vector .",
    "these possibilities are specially relevant for afm field induced by dopants in an otherwise non - magnetic insulator like bi@xmath2se@xmath3 or bi@xmath2te@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to build a @xmath1 classification for afm insulators with generic magnetic ordering , which we do in this paper .",
    "let us recall that the existence of kramers degeneracy@xcite is necessary for defining the @xmath1 index for trs insulators@xcite .",
    "kramers degeneracy is the exact double degeneracy of every single particle state in a spin-@xmath5 system with trs .",
    "we begin by studying the breaking or preservation of kramers degeneracy in afm insulators .",
    "while it is clear that ferromagnetism always breaks a kramers pair into energetically separated spin - up and spin - down states , we show that afm preserves the degeneracy of almost all single particle states , with exceptions detailed in later sections , if there is a lattice translation vector @xmath0 that inverts the spin at every site .",
    "this is because if such @xmath0 exists , we can define an anti - unitary operator@xcite @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the time - reversal symmetry operator , and @xmath8 represents a translation by @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath9 is a symmetry because both @xmath7 and @xmath8 invert the magnetization and so their combination recovers it .",
    "it is this symmetry that ensures that kramers degeneracies are preserved for almost all single particle states .",
    "afm insulators that are invariant under @xmath9 will be referred to as @xmath9-symmetric insulators hereafter .",
    "we may arrive at the same result beginning from a different perspective , by treating the afm field , a static field coherently coupled to the electrons in the form of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the spin operator and @xmath12 the spin indices , as perturbation and expressing the single - particle green s function to an arbitrary order of perturbation .",
    "this allows us to calculate the poles of the green s function to obtain the energy spectrum . from this perturbative point of view",
    ", the energy spectrum of the trs insulator is modified by the self - energy contribution from scattering by the afm field , and kramers degeneracy would require that the self - energy term be invariant under trs .",
    "the full self - energy counts in all scattering processes that send the particle to its initial state . since the afm field changes sign under trs , the scattering contribution from even number of scatterings",
    "are invariant under trs and those from odd number of scatterings are variant .",
    "therefore , the total self - energy term is invariant under trs if and only if there are only even number of scatterings .",
    "any commensurate afm field decomposes into a finite series of normal modes , namely @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the set of propagation vectors of the afm field .",
    "consider an electron with initial momentum @xmath15 , then after @xmath16 scatterings its momentum becomes @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "if this scattering process contributes to the self - energy , we have @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is any reciprocal lattice vector . preservation of the kramers degeneracy thus requires that only @xmath21 terms are nonzero . from this",
    ", we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a kramers degeneracy : for any set of @xmath22 integers @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 , there is @xmath25 .",
    "mathematically , satisfying this condition is completely equivalent to the existence of a lattice translation vector @xmath0 that inverts the afm field .",
    "this explicitly indicates that the propagation vectors alone determine whether a kramers degeneracy of @xmath9 is preserved or broken , while any other detail in the magnetic structure is irrelevant .",
    "also , we use the perturbation theory to estimate the split of the kramers pair when the above condition is violated .",
    "having established the necessary and sufficient conditions for the kramers degeneracy in a commensurate afm , we further investigate if this allows us to define a @xmath1 topological invariant .",
    "it is known that one can define the @xmath1 invariant using the pfaffians of the sewing matrix of time - reversal operator at time - reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) in 2d and 3d trs insulators@xcite .",
    "we prove that in @xmath9-symmetric afm insulators , a @xmath1-invariant can be defined only in 3d ( or certain higher dimensions ) using pfaffians of the sewing matrix associated with @xmath9 at half of the trim , while in 2d and 1d , the same definition gives a gauge variant quantity .",
    "this is because the @xmath26-dimensional afm @xmath1 number is defined in its @xmath27-dimensional subsystem that belongs to the symplectic class ( aii in the a - z classification@xcite of all hamiltonians ) , and 0d and 1d symplectic hamiltonians are always topologically trivial@xcite .",
    "however , when in addition to @xmath9 there is also spatial inversion symmetry , one can use inversion eigenvalues at half of the occupied bands to define a @xmath1-invariant in arbitrary dimensions .    in trs insulators",
    "there is a correspondence between the bulk @xmath1-invariant and the existence of gapless boundary modes@xcite : when the @xmath1 number is non - trivial , there are odd number of gapless ( dirac ) modes at the boundary of the system .",
    "here we show that the existence of gapless surface states in a 3d afm insulator requires two conditions : ( i ) it has a non - trivial @xmath1-invariant in the bulk and ( ii ) the surface termination _ also preserves _",
    "the @xmath9-symmetry , i.e. , the @xmath9 symmetry is unbroken on the surface .",
    "if the afm is small , one may say that the dirac surface modes of 3d trs ti are preserved in presence of a @xmath9-symmetric afm .",
    "however , in a 2d @xmath9-symmetric afm insulator , the surface modes are _ not _ protected from being pushed into the bulk by tuning the surface chemical potential .",
    "this is in exact agreement with the fact that the @xmath1-invariant is only well - defined in 3d @xmath9-symmetric afm insulators and not in lower dimensions .",
    "while a ti that has intrinsic afm ordering is yet to be experimentally established , the theory can be applied to ti thin films with induced afm ordering by an afm substrate . in principle",
    "one can use the substrates to induce various afm orderings in the ti thin film , but lattice matching at the interface is a practical issue .",
    "the lattice constants of the substrate should be nearly identical to those of the ti at the interface , or at least commensurate with them .",
    "if the afm substrate is @xmath9-symmetric in the redefined basis , the dirac point on the surface of the ti would be unbroken by the induced afm , while the surface state dispersion becomes anisotropic along the directions parallel and perpendicular the afm propagation vector .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the discussion to topological superconductors ( tsc ) with coexisting afm orders .",
    "given a @xmath26-dimensional tsc in the diii class ( sc s with non - negligible spin orbital coupling and with trs ) , which has an induced or intrinsic afm order , if the afm ordering is @xmath9-symmetric , then we show that the afm tsc has the same classification as a @xmath27-dimensional tsc without afm .",
    "therefore afm sc s in 3d and 2d have @xmath1 topological classifications@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : kramer ] , we show that a new type of degeneracy is preserved in an afm insulator if and only if it is @xmath9-symmetric . in sec.[sec : perturbation ] , we use perturbation expansion of self - energy in the single particle green s function to re - derive the condition for kramers degeneracy , and , when the condition is not met , the relation between the energy splitting of a kramers degeneracy by the afm and the propagation vectors of the afm . in sec.[sec : z2 ] , the results obtained in the previous sections are used to classify 3d afm insulators by a @xmath1-invariant . in sec.[sec : boundary ] we study the boundary modes of 2d and 3d afm insulators , reaching the conclusion that only 3d @xmath9-symmetric afm insulators may have protected gapless dirac modes , yet anisotropic , on the surface that is also @xmath9-symmetric . in sec.[sec : discussion ] , we discuss how the theory may be applied in real materials and also how an analysis similar to what we perform in afm insulators can be easily extended to afm superconductors .",
    "we conclude the work in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "throughout the paper , we assume that the electrons in the afm insulator can be modeled by a trs tight - binding hamiltonian that coherently couple to an antiferromagnetic zeeman field : [ eq : first_eq ] = _ 0+_m , where _ 0=_k,,,,_0^,(k)c^_(k)c_(k ) is the hopping part that is trs and _ m=_r,,,((r)_)c^_(r)c_(r ) is the part coupled to the zeeman field @xmath28 . in the above expressions and hereafter , greek letters denote the orbital degrees of freedom inside a unit cell with exceptions of @xmath12 which refer to up and down spin components .",
    "we assume @xmath29 s to be the basis vectors of the @xmath26-dimensional lattice in which the model is embedded ; and @xmath30 s are the corresponding reciprocal lattice basis vectors .",
    "the afm field @xmath28 breaks the lattice translation symmetry , but as long as its periods are commensurate with lattice vectors , it enlarges the unit cell of the crystal lattice . the enlarged unit cell , or magnetic unit cell , is given by the basis vectors @xmath31 s , which is in general a linear combination of the @xmath32 s with integer coefficients .",
    "the counterpart of the enlarged unit cell in the reciprocal space is the folded brillouin zone ( bz ) , or the magnetic bz ( mbz ) spanned by basis vectors @xmath33 s satisfying @xmath34 .    before proceeding to discuss the degeneracy in a time - reversal breaking afm system , it is helpful to briefly review the concept of kramers degeneracy in a trs system , and the key role it played in the @xmath1-classification of trs insulators in 2d and 3d .",
    "the time - reversal operator in the single - fermion sector of hilbert space , denoted by @xmath35 is defined as : [ eq : theta1]&=&k(i_y ) , where @xmath36 is the complex conjugate operator . from this definition",
    "one can see that @xmath37 is antiunitary and squares to minus the identity .",
    "these two properties guarantee that each single particle state is at least doubly degenerate@xcite .",
    "this degeneracy protected by time - reversal symmetry is called kramers degeneracy and the degenerate doublet referred to as a kramers pair . in a translationally invariant system",
    ", one can further show that an eigenstate with momentum @xmath15 is sent by @xmath37 to an equal energy eigenstate at momentum @xmath38 . specially , at center or corner of bz where we have @xmath39",
    "hence every energy level of @xmath40 must be doubly degenerate .",
    "these points at bz center and corners are called time - reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) and the kramers degeneracy at trim make possible the definition of a @xmath1-invariant in 2d and 3d trs insulators . in order to formally define this invariant",
    ", one uses the sewing matrix , which is defined as _",
    "mn(k)=_m(-k)||_n(k ) , where @xmath41 is the energy eigenstate at @xmath15 in the @xmath22-th band .",
    "the sewing matrix is antisymmetric at all trim and this antisymmetry enables the definition of the pfaffians at trim which form the basis of the definition of the @xmath1-invariant @xmath42 , given by ( fu - kane formula@xcite ) : ( -1)^_0=_k_inv .",
    "it should be noted that although it appears that @xmath42 only depends on the band structure at trim , it implicitly depends on the band structure in the whole bz , as a smooth gauge is required for this definition .    with the role of kramers degeneracy defined in trs insulators ,",
    "let us turn our attention to the afm insulators .",
    "any afm breaks trs because trs reverses all spins leaving the orbital and spatial components invariant as : [ eq : theta3 ] _ m^-1=-_m .",
    "therefore , kramers degeneracy in its original meaning does not exist in any afm insulator .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the spectrum is non - degenerate .",
    "in fact , each energy level may still be doubly degenerate , but the two states are not each other s time - reversed counterparts . in that case , there must be some other symmetry that protects the pair from splitting in energy . for a generic afm ti , the only symmetry is the magnetic translation symmetry by any magnetic superlattice vector @xmath43 ( a superposition of @xmath44 s with integer coefficients ) , i.e. , [ eq : temp11 ] [ , _ ^m]=0 , where @xmath45 is the operator for a translation by a lattice vector @xmath46 .",
    "eq.([eq : temp11 ] ) states that one can find a set of basis vectors that are common eigenstates of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the definition of @xmath48 dictates that its eigenvalues must be of the form @xmath49 , where @xmath15 is constrained within the first mbz .",
    "this symmetry gives us a band structure defined in mbz , but does not protect any degeneracy .",

    ", we plot the ground state of a classical heisenberg model on a triangular lattice .",
    "the basis vectors of the lattice , @xmath52 , and those of the magnetic superlattice , @xmath53 are also shown .",

    "combining eq.([eq : temp1 ] ) and eq.([eq : temp2 ] ) , we obtain a new symmetry of the full hamiltonian , @xmath59 : [ eq : thetas1][,_s]=0.since @xmath60 is unitary and @xmath37 antiunitary , @xmath61 is antiunitary , namely : [ eq : thetas2]|=_s|_s.on the other hand square of @xmath62 is [ eq : thetas3]_s^2=^2_2=-_2,where we have used the fact that @xmath35 and @xmath63 commute .    we now turn our attention to the degeneracy in the spectrum of @xmath47 .",
    "suppose @xmath64 is an eigenstate of both @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath15 a wave vector in the mbz , then |k , n&=&e_n(k)|k , n + _ ^m|k , n&=&(ik^m)|k , n , then from eq.([eq : thetas1 ] ) we have _",

    "+ eq.([eq : overlap ] ) shows that unless @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 , ensuring that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are two orthogonal states . beyond this , it is crucial to understand how the state @xmath65 transforms under a superlattice translation or [ eq : translation]_^m_s|k , n&=&_s_^m|k , n + & = & _ se^ik^m|k , n + & = & e^-ik^m_s|k , n.therefore @xmath65 must be proportional to a state with wavevector @xmath38 , or mathematically |-k , n=_n_mn(k)|k , n , where @xmath70 are band indices ( @xmath71 in general due to degeneracy ) and @xmath72 is called the sewing matrix of @xmath9 at @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , from eq.([eq : translation ] ) , we also notice that other than at trim @xmath65 is orthogonal to @xmath64 for a generic @xmath15 because they have different eigenvalues under superlattice translation .    to this point , we have shown that at all non - trim , the eigenstate at @xmath15 must be degenerate with another state at @xmath38",
    ". furthermore , at trim for which @xmath73 , each level at @xmath74 must be doubly degenerate and that at trim for which @xmath75 , the levels at @xmath74 are generically _ non - degenerate _ if there is no other symmetry present in the system . as we know that the trim with degenerate energy levels are important for the definition of @xmath1-invariant in a trs insulator ,",
    "thus it is important to distinguish the trim with @xmath75 .",

    "a simple example , consider a 2d antiferromagnet with a single propagation vector @xmath85 ( fig.[fig : structure](a ) ) .",
    "this means @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and therefore a - trim are @xmath88 and b - trim are @xmath89 , which is always a b - trim , and @xmath90 corresponding to @xmath91 .",

    "the cases of single propagation vectors @xmath92 , where @xmath93 has no common divisor , has been discussed in ref . [ ] , but here we extended it to arbitrary commensurate afm .",
    "the validity of the statement is independent of the particular strength of afm or the specific magnetic structure .",
    "we here give a more intuitive approach to understanding this result .",
    "we start from another perspective by treating the afm as a perturbation field applied to an otherwise trs system , and study how the perturbation breaks / preserves the kramers degeneracy of the trs system .",
    "the single particle hamiltonian of eq.([eq : first_eq ] ) can be rewritten as & = & _ k,,,,_,(k)c^_(k)c_(k ) + & + & _ k , i,,,((q_i)_)c^_(k+q_i)c_(k ) . where @xmath94 s are the fourier components of the zeeman field @xmath28",

    "though in general @xmath95 is not hermitian , it is hermitian in this problem as only elastic scattering is present ( and using @xmath98 ) :    ^_n(,k)&=&_q_i\\{q_1, ... ,q_m},q_1+",

    "we will now focus on the symmetry property of each term in the expansion of @xmath95 . under time - reversal operator of eq.([eq : theta1 ] ) , the free green s function transforms as _ 0(,k)^-1=g_0(,-k ) .",
    "the afm vertex from the expansion transforms as ( q_i)^-1=-(-q_i).therefore the @xmath100-th order self - energy transforms according to [ eq : sigmatransform]_n(,k)^-1=(-1)^n_n(,-k).since for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , then if @xmath103 for any @xmath104 , we have [ eq : sigmatrs](,k)^-1=(,-k).using eq.([eq : sigmatrs ] ) in conjunction with eq.([eq : theta1 ] ) , we know for each eigenstate @xmath105 of @xmath106 , @xmath107 must be an orthogonal eigenstate of @xmath108 with the same eigenvalue .",
    "therefore , as far as @xmath104 terms are vanishing in the self - energy expansion , the afm as a perturbation will _ not _ split the kramers degeneracy in a trs system .",
    "physically , this can be easily understood as follows : if an electron must experience an _ even _ number of scatterings by the afm field before going back to its initial state , the scattering amplitude does not change under time - reversal which changes the sign of afm ; therefore the single electron propagator can not ` see ' the breaking of trs and its poles remain doubly degenerate as in the case where trs is preserved .",
    "we now determine the condition under which the odd terms in the self energy disappear .",
    "let us start from an afm of a simple type in a 1d insulator to gain some intuition .",
    "we assume that there is only one wavevector @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is an integer . in the @xmath100-th ( @xmath104 ) order term of @xmath95 ,",
    "each @xmath111 must take either @xmath112 or @xmath113 , but because of the constraint @xmath114 , we can easily see that if @xmath115 , it is impossible to satisfy the constraint with an odd number of @xmath111 s , or in other words , @xmath116 . moreover , if @xmath117 , there are two cases : the first case is when @xmath118 where it is still not possible to satisfy the constraint if @xmath104 , @xmath119 .",

    "thus , by use of this simple example , we know that if @xmath115 , all odd terms in @xmath95 must vanish and if @xmath117 , the lowest nonvanishing odd order is the @xmath127-th order .    a similar analysis can be made for the general case . in a general commensurate afm , there are a finite number of propagation vectors denoted by @xmath128 . at each scattering",
    ", there is @xmath129 , so a generic scattering process that contributes to the self energy has @xmath130 times of momentum transfer @xmath131 and satisfies @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , if we want all odd orders in @xmath95 to vanish , we require that for any set of integers @xmath133 satisfying @xmath132 , @xmath25 .",
    "this is the sufficient and necessary condition under which every pair of doubly degenerate poles of @xmath97 remains degenerate in the poles of @xmath99 , given that the afm field is small enough to be treated as perturbation .",

    "in reality , arpes is a surface probe and therefore can not penetrate an arbitrary number of layers of atoms , and here we assume that it only probes the spectral weight of the _ surface _ rather than the bulk states . for a rough estimate , we only add up the contribution from the first two layers in eq .",
    "( [ eq : specweight ] ) . in fig.[fig : dispersion ] , the surface spectral weight is over - plotted with the band dispersion , where lighter / darker means higher / lower spectral weight . from these figures , we can see that for afm ti with large wavevector ( small @xmath100 ) , e.g. , @xmath267 , the spectral weight seen in experiment differs only minutely from what can be seen on the surface of a 3d ti , because the zone corner where the band bends backwards is actually filled with states distributed mainly in the bulk . as @xmath100-increases ,",

    "we can see that if there is no afm , the equal energy contour is always closed , but when @xmath272 , at very low energy it is still closed but becomes open in the @xmath175-direction as one increases the energy .",
    "the critical energy at which the fs becomes open decreases as @xmath100 increases ( or the wavevector decreases ) . as opposed to the equal energy contours in the dispersion plotted in fig.[fig : dispersion ] which are always closed , the intensity plot of the spectral weight can show open arcs .",
    "this is because the states far away from the dirac point are mostly bulk states having small spectral weight on the surface .",
    "what are the possible realizations of an afm tis ? in ref .",
    "[ ] , gdbipi was suggested as a ti with intrinsic afm ordering due to the presence possibly strong and frustrating spin exchange coupling .",
    "experimentally , there has been no report of any ti that is afm ordered . on the other hand , in principle",
    ", we may use afm substrate to induce afm ordering in a ti thin film .",
    "for example , substrates of under - doped cuprates and the parent compounds of iron - based superconductors have strong afm orderings and can induce afm in the ti thin film with propagation vector @xmath273 and @xmath274 , respectively@xcite . for more complex afm patterns one can use substrates with spiral antiferromagnetism or sinusoidal antiferromagnetism . in practice",
    ", we need the lattice matching between the substrate and the ti . for example",
    ", afm substrates with tetragonal ( cuprates ) and orthogonal ( iron - based superconductors ) lattices in general do not match the rhombohedral lattice of bi@xmath2se / te@xmath3 . but based on the fact that the lattice constants in the 122-family of iron - based superconductors ( @xmath275 ) are close to the lattice constant of the recently suggested ti of smb@xmath276@xcite ( @xmath277 ) , we speculate that one may use the afm state of 122 iron - based superconductors to induce stripe - like afm in a thin film of smb@xmath276 . if the lattices do not match , we need them to be at least commensurate with each other . in that case , at the interface , one needs to redefine superlattice , such that under translations by the redefined superlattice vectors , both lattices are invariant .",
    "then we can calculate the propagation vectors in the new basis and check if @xmath9-symmetry is preserved . if it is , from the theory we know that the afm preserves the dirac degeneracy of the surface states , but makes the dispersion anisotropic as shown in fig.[fig : arpes ] .",
    "part of the discussion for afm insulators can be easily extended to superconductors with coexisting afm orderings .",
    "specially , suppose we consider the superconductors with trs and spin - orbital coupling ( class diii ) , and with an intrinsic or induced afm coexisting with sc .",
    "if the system is @xmath9-symmetric , the @xmath27-dimensional subsystem defined by @xmath193 belongs to class diii , where the trs is replaced by @xmath9 which for this subsystem satisfies @xmath278 .",
    "therefore a @xmath26-dimensional afm sc with @xmath9 symmetry has the same topological classification as a @xmath27-dimensional trs superconductors ( class diii ) . from the general classification in ref .",
    ", 2d and 1d diii superconductors have @xmath1 classification ; therefore , 3d and 2d @xmath9-symmetric superconductors also have @xmath1 classification .",
    "the state with coexisting afm and sc may be realized by inducing an afm in a 3d tsc thin film ; for 3d tsc materials , copper doped bi@xmath2se / te@xmath3@xcite and indium doped snte@xcite have been proposed .",
    "we have assumed that no symmetry exists other than @xmath9 , but in general afm materials can have non - trivial magnetic groups , which possibly lead to much richer topological classifications beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "in this paper , we carry out a general study of the role of commensurate antiferromagnetism in topological insulators , generalizing the previous results of ref .. the hamiltonian of the electrons is modeled by a general trs tight - binding model subject to a space dependent periodic zeeman field having zero average ( zero ferromagnetism ) .",
    "it is found that when there exists a lattice translation @xmath0 that reverses the afm field at every site , the kramers pairs at half of the trim are unbroken by the afm field , while at the other half of the trim the eigenvalues are generically non - degenerate .",
    "the existence of @xmath0 is guaranteed when the fourier modes of the afm field satisfies the following condition : for any set of @xmath22 integers @xmath279 , if @xmath280 , then @xmath281 must be even , where @xmath131 s are the propagation vectors of the afm field .",
    "if this condition is not met , the energy splitting of the kramers pair can be estimated by knowing the propagation wavevectors of the afm field .",
    "furthermore , we show that the kramers pairs at half of the trim make possible the definition of a new @xmath1-quantity similar to the one defined for trs insulators . however , the new @xmath1-index is only meaningful in 3d , but not in 1d or 2d ( as it becomes a gauge variant quantity ) .",
    "the surface manifestation of the new @xmath1-index is the presence of gapless dirac modes in 3d afm tis .",
    "there are three differences between the surface modes of a afm ti and those of a trs ti : ( i ) to see the surface states , in afm ti the surface of termination must preserve the combined symmetry @xmath9 while in trs ti the system can be terminated at any surface ; ( ii ) in a afm ti , the dispersion of the surface band only connects the conduction and valence bands in one direction , but is separated from the bulk bands along the other direction , while in a trs ti the surface band connects the conduction and the valence bands along any direction ; ( iii ) the spectral weight of the surface states at a certain in - gap energy makes a closed loop in a trs ti , but appears as disconnected arcs in an afm ti at energies away from the dirac point .",
    "we discuss the materials in which the theory can be applied and also how the theory can be easily extended to the case of topological superconductors with coexisting afm orders . since in our work we have not assumed any other symmetry or any specific magnetic structure , the theory applies to general insulators with commensurate afm .",

    "the elimination of the first row can not proceed if and only if @xmath398 and @xmath394 , that is , when all elements in the first row are nonzero and have the _ same _ denominator .",

    "<S> we show that ( i ) there is a new type of kramers degeneracy protected by the combined symmetry ; ( ii ) a new @xmath1 index may be defined for 3d afm insulators , but not for those in lower dimensions and ( iii ) in 3d afm insulators with a non - trivial @xmath1 index , there are odd number of gapless surface modes if and only if the surface termination also preserves the combined symmetry , but the dispersion of surface states becomes highly anisotropic if the afm propagation vector becomes small compared with the reciprocal lattice vectors . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically demonstrate the theory by calculating the spectral weight of the surface states of a 3d ti in the presence of afm fields with different propagation vectors , which may be observed by arpes in bi@xmath2se@xmath3 or bi@xmath2te@xmath3 with induced antiferromagnetism . </S>"
