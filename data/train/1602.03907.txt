    "a pioneering paper by feynman @xcite re - ignited the interest in directed transport @xcite , this meaning unbiased transport phenomena in systems which are driven out of equilibrium .",
    "there is a wealth of fields for their application such as biology @xcite , nanotechnology @xcite , chemistry @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , and bose - einstein condensates @xcite , for example . among all these alternatives ,",
    "we focus in deterministic ratchets with dissipation generally associated with a classical asymmetric chaotic attractor @xcite ; the quantum versions lead to interesting applications in cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the classical aspects of the parameter space of this system have been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "these new results revealed that the isoperiodic stable structures ( isss , lyapunov stable islands ) have a fundamental role in the current shape .",
    "the quantum counterparts of these structures ( qisss ) @xcite have proven to be very well approximated by means of a thermal coarse graining of the classical dynamical equations ( i.e. , adding thermal noise of the order of @xmath0 ) in representative cases . taking into account these examples ,",
    "it was recently found @xcite that the perron - frobenius operators associated with the classical evolution with thermal noise and the quantum superoperators without it show very similar spectra .",
    "it deserves noticing that the study of perron - frobenius operators in the ulam approximation is very useful in open systems theory @xcite    in a recent publication a semiclassical approach has been taken into account @xcite .",
    "there , it was argued that an effective ( semi)classical map with noise could be used as a direct replacement for the quantum system itself and several consequences have been derived .",
    "we take into account a thermal - like noise , i.e. a gaussian noise whose strength is given by @xmath0 , leaving no free parameters .",
    "it is important to underline that the effective temperature to which it can be associated is different throughout the parameter space . nevertheless , both our thermal noise approach and the semiclassical one are very much alike . in this work",
    "we verify our conjecture about the role of the coarse graining due to quantization : it shares the main properties of a thermal coarse graining for this kind of dissipative systems .",
    "in fact , it induces chaotic behaviour in situations where one expects a simple attractor for instance @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of general nature and is applicable to any finite @xmath0 value , including the semiclassical regime which of course is compatible with it . finally , the quantum regime is not only interesting from a theoretical point of view , but also for a great number of experimental situations in which the semiclassical limit is not reached .",
    "however , there are relevant finite @xmath0 quantum effects that can not be reproduced by a classical map . in this paper",
    "we find that , though the general correspondence is very good , there are specific regions in which this mechanism shows limitations .",
    "this is clearly seen with the help of the main quantity of interest in directed transport , i.e. the asymptotic current , keeping in mind that it is just an average quantity that does not reflect a complete picture . also , it is important to notice that transitory regimes are interesting but they are not the main objective here .",
    "but , when we study the spectra of the perron - frobenius operators with thermal noise and the quantum superoperators without it we find an almost uniform correspondence , with no clear signs of these discrepancy regions .",
    "this could be puzzling in view of the current behaviour previously mentioned .",
    "moreover , we already know @xcite that chaotic limit sets provide a quite deal of mixing with no need of noise , making uniformity unexpected . on the other hand , even for the chaotic case the thermal coarse graining is necessary to smooth out the classical fluctuations not present in the quantum version and in order to make both spectra agree @xcite . to clarify this",
    "we explore the morphology of the eigenvectors associated with the equilibrium eigenvalues . here",
    "we find that surviving coherences ( that can not be reproduced by means of a classical model with noise ) are a key indicator to understand the limits that this mechanism shows in describing some asymptotic currents .",
    "this also provides valuable information in order to develop a semiclassical approximation of the equilibrium eigenstates  a long standing objective  perhaps taking into account convenient wavepackets and the classical dynamics with thermal noise .",
    "this paper has the following structure : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce our model which is a modified kicked rotator with dissipation , clearly explaining the way in which we add the thermal noise in the classical model to find the correspondence with the quantum one . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we explore the difference between the classical and quantum asymptotic currents in the parameter space finding that there are regions in which the correspondence is not so accurate . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we systematically explore the spectra of the classical perron - frobenius operator with thermal noise and the quantum superoperator in the parameter space , which show a seemingly uniform correspondence . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we explain this apparent contradiction by extending this study to the phase space and using the weyl - wigner distributions of the equilibrium eigenvectors . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a particle moving in one dimension [ @xmath1 periodically kicked by the asymmetric potential : @xmath2 \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\delta(t - m \\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the strength of each kick and @xmath4 is the kicking period . when adding dissipation we obtain a dissipative ratchet system that can be written as the following map @xcite @xmath5 \\\\",

    "the conservative limit is reached at @xmath10 , whereas the value @xmath11 gives the maximum damping . in order to simplify the parametric dependence it is usual to introduce a rescaled momentum variable @xmath12 and the quantity @xmath13 .",
    "the directed current emerges as a consequence of breaking the spatial and temporal symmetries by adopting @xmath14 with @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we take @xmath17 and @xmath18 throughout this work .",
    "we have conjectured @xcite that the main effects of the quantum fluctuations are similar to those of gaussian fluctuations of the order of @xmath0 in the classical analogue ( @xmath0 is the effective planck constant to be defined in the next paragraph ) . in order to introduce it",
    "we take @xmath19 in eq .",
    "[ dissmap ] , where @xmath20 .",
    "though the essential idea is the gaussian nature of fluctuations on the effective planck scale , we can associate the noise variable @xmath21 with a temperature @xmath22 by means of the relation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant ( which we take equal to 1 ) .",

    "note that we have explicitly fixed the value of @xmath22 as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "this leaves no free parameters in order to test the behaviour of our conjecture in this situation .",
    "however we underline that this is not essential for it to be valid . in the following",
    ", when we refer to classical properties or quantities it is assumed that they correspond to the classical system with thermal noise unless otherwise stated .    the corresponding quantum model without thermal noise",

    "all this is enough to compare the behaviour of the asymptotic currents .",
    "but if we want to go further in a systematic study of the classical to quantum correspondence we need to incorporate more quantities .",

    "[ dissmap ] .",

    "[ lindblad ] . here",
    "for the diagonalization of @xmath42 and @xmath57 we have used the arnoldi method .",
    "we first look at the properties of asymptotic ratchet currents @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 stands for either the classical or quantum averages ) .",
    "a word of caution is in order here ; this quantity is an average and as such the information it provides regarding classical - quantum correspondence is limited .",
    "nevertheless it is the main quantity of interest for directed transport systems , along with the widths of distributions @xcite . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the difference @xmath60 , where @xmath61 stands for the classical current and @xmath62 for the quantum one .",
    "this shows the distance between them , i.e. the discrepancy in the approximation .",
    "the differences are in general quite small as can be seen from the white - yellow overall appearance of the plot . for this statement to be meaningful one has to keep in mind the much higher currents of the original classical system without thermal noise .",
    "also , one should remember that the width in @xmath63 of the distributions can be two orders of magnitude greater than these values .",
    "this is a proof that , regarding currents , our conjecture works very well , despite we have fixed the size of the fluctuations at exactly @xmath0 , a too restrictive requirement .",
    "but this image also shows that a plain replacement of the quantum currents with this kind of approximations could lead to quantitatively wrong results .",
    "this is specially evident in some regions of the isoperiodic structures @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "there are also minor differences in the other @xmath66 structures and in a few cases of chaotic regions .",
    "it is also interesting to note that some of the better correspondence arises in borders of what is left of the original classical parameter space regions associated with either chaotic or regular behaviour .",
    "these are small fluctuations but still give a hint on a missing ingredient that could be responsible for the enhancement of one or the other structure at either side of this frontier .",

    "[ fig1 ] the sign difference @xmath67 is displayed .",
    "this shows that for almost all cases the sign is very well reproduced , but also that  though being quite similar  the borders of the positive and negative regions do not necessarily coincide .",
    "the asymptotic current is the main quantity of interest in directed transport but , being an average is not a very precise gauge to measure the correspondence behavior which we are interested to test in this work .",
    "then we turn to study complementary quantities . in this section",
    "we look at the properties of the spectra of the perron - frobenius operators and the quantum superoperators @xcite . for",

    "we have considered just the longest - lived eigenvalues , but in order to check the convergence of this measure we have taken into account three different values for the minimum modulus required to be considered as such ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , by means of green , red and violet solid lines , respectively ) .",
    "the behaviour is quite consistent and these curves show no meaningful jumps , being all of them around one order of magnitude lower than the minimum moduli .",
    "this not only tells us that the spectral correspondence is good but that it is approximately uniform . as a guide to the eye",

    "[ fig5 ] we can see that there is an excess of classical probability around the location of the limit cycle associated to this structure ( see the green line corresponding to the classical distribution without noise ) .",

    "this is the largest regular region and the influence of the surrounding areas of ( mainly ) chaos is reduced in its bulk .",
    "it seems that quantum effects enhance the probability transfer between these otherwise separated structures , going further than the rebalancing introduced by a plain coarse graining due to the size of @xmath0 . as a matter of fact",
    ", we can clearly see the quantum nature of the distributions by means of the interference fringes that reveal the persistence of coherences despite the interaction with a quantum dissipative environment ( at least at this finite values of the effective planck constant ) .",

    "[ fig5 ] , the @xmath105 distributions are also of the same nature than those of the first example .",
    "the behaviour is exactly the same as for @xmath64 , so our explanation of these discrepancies is of general nature .",
    "we have systematically studied the classical - quantum correspondence via thermal noise in a paradigmatic directed transport system , the dissipative modified kicked rotator .",
    "we have explored a good portion of the parameter space in terms of the asymptotic currents and the spectra of both , the classical operators and the quantum superoperators . the first approach , though confirming the overall correspondence gave us the expected picture of a non uniform shape , dependent on the kind of dynamics underlying each region . on the contrary ,",
    "the spectral study resulted in a uniform behaviour . by focusing on the morphology of the equilibrium eigenstates",
    ", we could verify through well developed interference fringes , that the quantum nature is persistent at this finite @xmath0 , despite the environmental effects .",
    "this resilient quantumness is responsible for an enhancement of probability transfer from the main regular structures to the ones surrounding them in parameter space .",
    "an effective ( semi)classical map with noise has been proposed as a direct replacement for the quantum system and some results have been derived from this identification @xcite .",
    "this map is quite similar to our much simpler approach , which is just a map with thermal noise with no free parameters .",
    "ours is based on the general assumption that the main features of the quantum coarse graining are similar to those of a gaussian coarse graining with size of the order of @xmath0 , in this directed transport system .",
    "this can be considered simplistic but it turns out to be precise enough in the overwhelming majority of the cases .    of course , there are known discrepancies @xcite .",
    "again , we ascribe the difference in the asymptotic currents for some specific cases to finite @xmath0 quantum effects . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that for dissipative markovian systems in the semiclassical limit , the wigner function evolves into a positive - definite phase - space distribution . however , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the wigner functions of the equilibrium eigenstates display negative values due to interference fringes .",
    "this shows that for the value of @xmath0 used here , we have not reached the semiclassical limit . as such ,",
    "we conclude that though the classical dynamics with gaussian / thermal noise is a very good approximation to the quantum dynamics , quantum effects could still be non - neglectable , making a direct replacement an oversimplification .",
    "in fact , if one wants to develop a semiclassical approximation of theoretical interest and amenable to the vast majority of experimental situations in the quantum realm , coherences are needed .",
    "perhaps they could be included by means of suitable wavepackets combined with the classical dynamics plus noise .",
