    "an interpretation of recent astrophysical observations on compact neutron stars  @xcite has driven the nuclear physics and astrophysics communities to detailed investigations of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) under conditions far beyond the ordinary matter  @xcite . theoretical and experimental studies on heavy - ion collisions  @xcite over the last few decades concluded a softening of the eos at high densities , which was compatible with phenomenological  @xcite , as well as with microscopic models  @xcite .",
    "however , the recent observations of pulsars with masses of 1.97 @xmath1 0.04 @xmath2  @xcite and 2.01 @xmath1 0.04 @xmath2  @xcite gave some controversial insights on the high - density eos .",
    "these observations provide the upper limit for the neutron star mass by excluding a soft eos at high baryon densities .    on the other hand , the in - medium antinucleon - nucleon interactions are closely related to the high baryon density domain of the eos .",
    "in highly compressed and cold matter the baryons can reach very high fermi momenta .",
    "such kinematical conditions can be also achieved in an antiproton - nucleus reaction for a short time before annihilation .",
    "in fact , in antiproton - nucleus collisions , where in rare events antiprotons penetrate deep inside the nucleus , significant compressional effects are expected  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of antinucleon - interactions in nuclear medium can provide useful information and additional constraints on the nuclear eos .",
    "the traditional approach for the description of nuclear matter is a well established relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory  @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , rmf can not properly describe in - medium antinucleon interactions using the g - parity arguments only , which is supposed to be a symmetry of rmf . on the contrary ,",
    "the microscopic models for the description of in - medium antinucleon potentials strongly rely on g - parity in construction of the bare antinucleon - nucleon interaction starting from the nucleon - nucleon potential  @xcite .",
    "this is considered as a problem in rmf approach , therefore , different solutions have been proposed . for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite a violation of g - parity in nuclear matter has been considered . in ref .",
    "@xcite another method was invented to resolve this issue by using energy dependent interactions .",
    "however , this approach has limitations in density and lacks the thermodynamic consistency .    in this work",
    "we address the issue why the conventional rmf models are not consistent with antiproton - nucleus dirac phenomenology .",
    "our studies are based on the non - linear derivative ( nld ) model to rmf as formulated in ref .",
    "the nld model describes simultaneously the density dependence of the nuclear eos , the momentum dependence of the proton - nucleus schrdinger - equivalent optical potential and the recent observations of neutron star masses . in this work",
    "we extend our studies from ref .",
    "@xcite and show that in a g - parity conserving nld framework the in - medium proton and antiproton optical potentials can be consistently reproduced in agreement with empirical data .",
    "we further compare the nld calculations with scattering data .",
    "it is demonstrated , in particular , that the nld model can describe the antiproton - nucleus reaction cross section data fairly well .",
    "furthermore , we discuss other effects related to the behavior of antinucleons in nuclear matter and predict a considerable in - medium splitting between nucleon and antinucleon effective masses .",
    "the relevance of our results for upcoming experiments at fair is discussed .",
    "at first , we briefly discuss the nld model and for additional details we refer to refs .",
    "the nld approach is based on a field theoretical formalism of relativistic hadrodynamics ( rhd ) .",
    "the nld lagrangian @xmath3 contains the free lagrangians for the dirac field @xmath4 and for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson fields .",

    "( [ nld ] ) @xmath17 are non - linear derivative operators , see ref .",
    "@xcite . they generate ( infinite ) series of higher - order derivative terms in the generalized euler - lagrange equations of motion .",
    "this series of terms lead to a momentum ( energy ) cut - off , which regulates the high momentum behavior of relativistic mean - fields in the interaction lagrangian .",
    "the important feature of nld model is that , independent of the functional form of the non - linear operators , all the higher - order derivative interactions can be resummed exactly in the rmf approximation .",
    "the in - medium rmf interactions are obtained from the equations of motion for all degrees of freedom . for the generalized functional in eq .",

( [ dirac_p ] ) and  ( [ dirac_pbar ] ) reads as @xmath29 though the scalar self - energies between nucleons and antinucleons are formally the same , the kinetic energy dependence will generate a difference between them .",
    "therefore , we distinguish them by different symbols in the following .",
    "the single particle energies @xmath30 for nucleons and antinucleons are obtained from the corresponding in - medium mass - shell conditions @xmath31 @xmath32 with the in - medium ( effective or dirac ) masses of nucleons and antinucleons , given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "they depend explicitly on particle momentum .    in nuclear matter the nld equations of motion for the meson - fields",
    "are reduced to standard rmf algebraic equations @xmath35 where the various quantities and lorentz - densities are given in ref .",
    "the densities on the r.h.s in above equations depend explicitly on the particle momentum .",
    "the meson - field equations show a similar form as in standard rmf , however , the essential difference between the nld approach and conventional rmf appears in the various lorentz - sources of the meson fields , which get regulated at high momenta .    the way one regulates the high - momentum behavior of fields is phenomenological . in ref .",
    "@xcite a simple monopole form @xmath36 has been used where @xmath37 is a cut - off parameter .",
    "it has been found that eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) was able to accommodate the saturation properties of nuclear matter and , at the same time , the energy dependence of the schrdinger - equivalent optical potential .",
    "note , that in the limit @xmath38 one has @xmath39 , such that the original rhd lagrangian is recovered .",
    "meanwhile in refs .  @xcite the nld model has been tested with different choices of the cut - off function .",
    "( 12.,10.0 ) ( -0.5,0.0 ) ( 4.75,1.5 )    the nld approach is thermodynamically consistent  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the model ( coupling constants and cut - off ) were adjusted to the empirical properties of nuclear matter and to the momentum dependence of the in - medium potential at saturation . as discussed in detail in  @xcite",

    "[ fig1 ] we demonstrate our new calculations of the equation of state ( eos ) ( pressure versus energy density , main panel ) for nuclear matter in @xmath40-equilibrium .",
    "the nld calculation ( solid curve ) reproduces the empirical analyses from astrophysical studies ( shaded areas ) fairly well  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are the constraints from neutron star measurements .",
    "this is shown in the inner part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in terms of the mass - radius relation of neutron stars , where the nld result is compared with various astrophysical observations ( double ns systems and j1903 + 0327 ) , and in particular , with the recent measurements on binary pulsars  @xcite .",
    "the explicit momentum - dependence of the nld mean - fields is essential for a simultaneous description of low and high density observations involving , in particular , the empirical results from dirac - phenomenology on the schrdinger - equivalent optical potential .",
    "the latter is important for the extension of our studies to in - medium antinucleon interactions .",
    "the parameters of the nld model used here have already been fixed in ref .",
    "@xcite at the bulk properties of nuclear matter and in - medium proton optical potential .",
    "therefore , we do not readjust any parameters in this work when extending the nld model to the description of antinucleons in nuclear matter .",
    "we just use the g - parity arguments for the construction of the in - medium antinucleon interaction .",
    "( 12.,8.0 ) ( -1.25,0.0 )    we start the discussion with the in - medium antiproton scalar and vector self - energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] they are shown as a function of the in - medium antiproton kinetic energy @xmath41 at three baryon densities ( note that @xmath42 is negative for antinucleons by neglecting the isovector contributions , see eq .",
    "( [ sigmas_nm ] ) ) .",
    "the conventional walecka approach ( nl3 parametrization  @xcite , dashed curves ) shows the usual linear behavior in density for the vector self - energy , while the scalar component saturates with density .",
    "obviously , the walecka self - energies are flat as a function of the kinetic energy .",
    "on the other hand , the nld relativistic self - energies ( solid curves ) decrease with increasing kinetic energy at each baryon density .",
    "the strong suppression of the high - density and high - momentum tails of the nld self - energies result from the momentum dependence of the fields , see eqs .",
    "( [ sigmav_nm],[sigmas_nm ] ) .",
    "in particular , at zero kinetic energy the walecka model leads to a value of @xmath43  mev , which remains constant in energy and is very deep . on the contrary ,",
    "the nld model reduces considerably the deepness of the in - medium antinucleon potential in all ranges of shown kinetic energies .    as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to reproduce the data from antiproton - induced reactions within a transport model , the antinucleon - meson couplings of the walecka model had to be rescaled by a phenomenological factor of @xmath44 .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show such calculations in the walecka model with rescaled couplings ( factor 0.25 , dash - dotted curves in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "as one can see , the rescaled walecka model  @xcite , which is supposed to explain the antiproton - nucleus data , just reproduces in average the nld results .",
    "( 12.,10.0 ) ( -1.0,0.0 ) ( 5.,1.5 )    the momentum dependence of the relativistic mean - fields can be probed by looking at the schrdinger - equivalent optical potential .",
    "its real part is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is the energy of a nucleon ( antinucleon ) with bare mass @xmath48 inside nuclear matter at a fixed baryon density , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the corresponding vector self - energy and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) denotes the scalar self - energy component .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows @xmath53 as function of the kinetic energy for in - medium antiprotons at saturation density .",
    "the shaded areas for antiprotons around zero kinetic energy and antiprotons at high energies are the results of phenomenological analyses of refs .",
    "it can be seen that the momentum dependence is crucial for a correct description of the deepness of the optical potential ( solid curve ) , whereas the standard walecka approach ( dashed curve ) does not reproduce the absolute value and the trend of empirical data .",
    "the comparison with the empirical analyses is improved in the rescaled walecka model ( dot - dashed curve ) .    the inner graph in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the corresponding results for the proton case , where the nld calculations ( solid curve ) describe the dirac phenomenology very well .",
    "however , the walecka model ( dashed curve ) again disagrees with the data ( filled symbols  @xcite ) .",
    "we stress again that the nld model parameters are kept fixed when going from in - medium proton to in - medium antiproton interactions .    at this point",
    "we would like to explain the behavior of the optical potential in the nld model at kinetic energies around @xmath54 .",
    "this can be done by considering the in - medium dispersion relation , that is @xmath55 where @xmath56 and is equal to @xmath57 with @xmath52 ( @xmath42 ) being the scalar ( vector ) rmf self - energies of the antiproton at fixed nuclear matter density .",
    "hence , neglecting isovector contributions the single - antiparticle momentum in nuclear matter contains the sum of the scalar and the vector components of the rmf self - energies , @xmath58 .",
    "note , that in the case of in - medium protons the sign of the vector self - energy changes , @xmath59 . in the antiproton case",
    "the single - antiparticle momentum is very big , while in the proton case it is essentially given by the small difference between scalar and vector mean - fields .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the in - medium kinetic energy @xmath60 is shown as a function of the single-(anti)particle momentum for nuclear matter at saturation density of @xmath61 . indeed , while in the proton case the momentum for a particle with in - medium kinetic energy @xmath62 is of the order of the fermi momentum only , its value increases largely for the antiproton case .",
    "for an antiproton in matter at saturation density it approaches values of several hundreds of @xmath63 , namely @xmath64 , which are comparable with the nucleon mass .",
    "( 12.,10.0 ) ( -1.,0.0 )    this momentum - shift shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] has significant consequences for the behavior of the potential deepness at zero in - medium kinetic energy , @xmath65 , when the self - energies depend on single - particle momentum .",
    "in fact , as it is shown in the inserted graph in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the nld self - energies are reduced with increasing single - particle momenta . at a momentum of @xmath66 the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the scalar @xmath69 and vector @xmath70 self - energies ,",
    "respectively , are obtained .",
    "the sum of @xmath71 is considerably smaller than the corresponding sum at fermi momentum . since with increasing momentum the nld fields are getting reduced , and in the antinucleon - case the sum of scalar and vector self - energies matters , therefore these effects results in the reduced value of the in - medium antinucleon potential .",
    "( 12.,8.0 ) ( -1.3,0.0 )    ( 12.,10.0 ) ( -0.5,0.0 )    another effect generated by the momentum shift between in - medium protons and in - medium antiprotons , concerns the effective particle masses .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the effective masses for protons , @xmath33 , and antiprotons , @xmath34 , in nuclear matter versus their kinetic energies and at two baryon densities . a mass shift between protons and antiprotons",
    "is observed , which becomes pronounced with decreasing kinetic energy and increasing baryon density . at the same value of the kinetic energy the proton scalar self - energy @xmath52",
    "is obtained at a smaller proton momentum than in the antiproton case , where @xmath52 is larger .",
    "therefore , at the same kinetic energy the effective proton mass is smaller as compared to the effective antiproton mass .",
    "this mass splitting between protons and antiprotons becomes moderate with increasing kinetic energy because of the less pronounced momentum dependence of @xmath52 at high particle momenta .",
    "however , the mass splitting is strongly density dependent .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where the effective proton and antiproton masses are shown at zero kinetic energy as a function of the baryon density .",
    "one would expect that the only effect of the g - parity is the sign change in the vector self - energy .",
    "this is indeed the case in the standard walecka models where there is no difference between the in - medium proton and antiproton masses .",
    "however , the nld self - energies depend on momentum , as supported by dirac phenomenologies .",
    "the impact of momentum dependence supplemented by different momentum shifts of protons and antiprotons in the scalar self - energies produces this observed mass splitting .",
    "note the analogy with the isospin induced mass splitting between protons and neutrons in isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter . in the nld model there is a mass splitting effect between nucleons and antinucleons also in g - asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "next , we compare the nld calculations with scattering data .",
    "this requires the knowledge of both , the real and the imaginary part of the in - medium optical potential .",

    "note that eq .",
    "( [ disprel ] ) makes sense only if @xmath76 does not diverge with increasing momentum like in the standard walecka model .",
    "this property of @xmath76 is realized in the nld model .",

    "( 12.,10.0 ) ( -1.0,0.0 )    having both , the real and imaginary parts of the in - medium potential as function of beam momentum and density , we can now use the nld optical potential to estimate the antiproton total cross sections in the scattering off nuclei .",
    "the numerical procedure is as follows . for a given nuclear target we use the empirical wood - saxon density distributions",
    "@xcite . they provide us with the density profiles which are used as an input to calculate the corresponding nuclear potential @xmath77 as a function of the radial coordinate .",

    "[ fig8 ] we show the nld calculations for the total cross section as function of the antiproton beam momentum on different nuclear targets .",

    "@xcite , whereas the experimental cross sections at the higher energies for @xmath87 and @xmath88 are from  @xcite . for antiproton reactions on the heavier @xmath90 target shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] there exist only few experimental estimations  @xcite . as one can see , the calculations reproduce the absolute values , momentum and mass number dependence of the total cross sections fairly well .",
    "the comparison of the nld model with the results of empirical studies and with experimental data is remarkable .",
    "our results compare well also with calculations done within the giessen - buu transport model  @xcite . in that work",
    "the imaginary part of the in - medium antiproton interaction was determined with the help of the collision integral of the transport equation , where the elastic , inelastic and annihilation processes were taken into account .",
    "there a standard rmf model has been also used .",
    "however , as we have already discussed , in ref .",
    "@xcite one had to strongly reduce the antinucleon - meson coupling constants to achieve a good description of antiproton absorption cross section data at low and intermediate energies .",
    "therefore , in line with ref .",
    "@xcite a possible violation of g - parity was discussed .",
    "this conclusion is not supported by the results of the present work , where a simple constraint imposed by the energy dependence of the schrdinger - equivalent optical potential may result in a consistent g - parity conserved description of both , the in - medium nucleon and antinucleon interactions .",
    "the nld model with momentum dependent mean - fields has been applied in the past successfully for the descriptions of nuclear matter at low and high baryon densities . in this work",

    ", we find a considerable reduction of the optical potential for antiprotons as compared to the standard rmf models . the same momentum dependence results in a new effective mass splitting between nucleons and antinucleons in nuclear matter .",
    "this sort of medium induced g - asymmetry becomes pronounced for low energy antinucleons and increases with rising baryon density .",
    "furthermore , the imaginary part of the in - medium optical potential has been determined by using the dispersion relation .",
    "the results concerning the imaginary part of the antiproton potential are compatible with available phenomenological analyses .",
    "we then applied the nld optical potential to the description of antiproton - induced reactions on nuclear targets .",
    "our calculations reproduce fairly well the dependence of the total reaction cross sections on beam momentum and nuclear mass number .",
    "we demonstrated that momentum dependent interactions , as realized in nld model , lead to a consistent description of empirical information and experimental data .",
    "together with the successful application of nld approach to low and high density nuclear matter , we conclude that , a proper relativistic mean - field formalism should account for the momentum dependence of fields .",
    "this is important for a correct rmf description of nuclear matter and finite systems .    as an outlook",
    ", it would be interesting to apply the nld in reactions with heavy - ion and antiproton beams within transport theoretical descriptions .",
    "in particular , the mass splitting between nucleons and antinucleons , as predicted in this work , is expected to show up in various observables .",
    "for instance , it is known that in- and out - of - plane collective flows as well as subthreshold particle production are sensitive to possible mass splitting effects .",
    "thus , the investigations of compressed matter in reactions relevant for @xmath91anda  at fair may provide interesting signals as probes of the nld predictions .",
