    "<S> new functionalities in nonlinear optics will require systems with giant optical nonlinearity as well as compatibility with photonic circuit fabrication techniques . </S>",

    "<S> these results show the promise of our system as a high speed , low power , integrated platform for physics and devices based on strong interactions between photons .    </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of strong nonlinearity into photonic circuits has many applications ranging from optical information processing  @xcite and soliton physics  @xcite to the study of inter - particle interactions  @xcite in photonic analogs of important physical systems such as photonic topological insulators@xcite , optical analogs of quantum hall systems . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we address the problem of introducing strong optical nonlinearity by studying ultra - low - power optical solitons in a novel slab waveguide geometry we recently introduced  @xcite where photons are strongly coupled to quantum - well excitons . </S>",
    "<S> temporal optical solitons are one of the most fundamental nonlinear phenomena in optics . </S>",
    "<S> they arise due to a competition between group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) , where different frequency components accumulate different phase during propagation , and nonlinear phase modulation where intensity dependent phase shifts can exactly balance those due to gvd  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have been proposed for applications  @xcite and observed  @xcite in long - haul communications lines and more recently investigated in the micro- and nano - scale waveguides suitable for design of all optical processing chips @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on - chip applications require that solitons form and interact over small distances , which requires that both the gvd and nonlinear effects develop on very short length scales . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important for information processing applications that the underlying nonlinearity responds on picosecond or faster timescales . achieving short nonlinear length scales while minimising power requirments necessitates very large nonlinearity . to generate significant gvd , </S>",
    "<S> photonic crystal band engineering and semiconductor photonic wires have been used in a number of schemes@xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously achieve giant nonlinearity and gvd by exploiting the unique optical properties of exciton - polaritons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these quasi - particles are the quantum eigenmodes formed when photons couple strongly to a quantum - well exciton resonance . </S>",
    "<S> they have characteristics coming from both their light and matter constituents , with the proportion depending on the detuning from resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the photonic component contributes long lifetime and detailed control over system properties via photonic circuit fabrication techniques  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> matter - like interparticle scattering leads to enormous nonlinearity which responds on an ultrafast timescale . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate formation of bright sub - picosecond temporal polariton solitons with pulse energies of less than 0.5 pj . from the soliton formation threshold we deduce a nonlinear refractive index </S>",
    "<S> three orders of magnitude larger than in any other ultrafast optical system , which verifies the highly nonlinear nature of our platform . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the frequency dependent transition of polaritons from photon - like to matter - like leads to giant group velocity dispersion on the order of 1000 ps@xmath0 m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is comparable to that achieved in fiber bragg gratings and photonic crystal waveguides@xcite . as we achieve the gvd necessary for soliton formation without the need for transverse photonic confinement we are able to study spatio - temporal effects as well as purely temporal ones . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally demonstrate dark - bright spatio - temporal solitons , which to our knowledge have not previously been seen in any experimental setting with either photons or polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> these are solitons where the intensity is peaked in the propagation direction and extended in the transverse direction apart from a dark notch . </S>",
    "<S> note that bright@xcite and spatial dark@xcite exciton - polariton solitons have previously been reported in strongly coupled bragg microcavities . </S>",
    "<S> compared to these our system has the advantages of an order of magnitude faster soliton velocity , simplicity of design and fabrication , compatibility with existing designs of high performance waveguide photonic circuit elements and , crucially , does not depend on external continuous wave pumping to balance loss for soliton formation to be possible . apart from these , </S>",
    "<S> the major advantages of our platform for nonlinear optics are the combination of very large nonlinearity and ultra - fast temporal response . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic nature of the large dispersion is also advantageous for on - chip soliton formation , pulse compression  @xcite and the study of two - dimensional effects .     between polariton and exciton energies.,width=8 ]    </S>",
    "<S> the structures we use in this work are planar algaas waveguides with quantum wells parallel to the substrate  @xcite , see schematic diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> diffraction in the crystal growth direction is prevented by total internal reflection . </S>",
    "<S> as the photonic losses are moderate and broadening of the exciton line is suppressed ( the temperature is 10k ) the system is in the strong coupling regime and exciton - polaritons are formed . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is excited by pulses with a square spectral envelope of 5.5mev corresponding to an approximately 350 femto - second ( fs ) temporal full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pulses are coupled in at near - zero incidence angle through the input grating , propagate 600 @xmath2 m and couple out through the output grating . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) shows the polariton dispersion relation determined by angle - resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the momentum increases along the lower polariton branch the polaritons become more matter like and their group velocity approaches zero .    in order to model the experimental results we describe a light pulse interaction with a narrow exciton resonance using the maxwell - lorentz system . </S>",
    "<S> any group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) related to the waveguide geometry is negligible over the spectral range close to the exciton resonance and in comparison with the gvd induced by the photon exciton coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting set of equations accounting for the dominant nonlinearity originating in the two - body exciton - exciton interaction is    [ eq : max_lorentz ] @xmath3    here @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the propagation constant and the group velocity of the photonic waveguide mode at the exciton frequency @xmath6 and @xmath7 . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the coordinates , respectively , along and across the propagation direction . </S>",
    "<S> the waveguide width along @xmath9 is much larger than the diffractive spread achieved over its length . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is time , @xmath11 is the amplitude of the photonic mode , which is tightly bound in the direction perpendicular to the waveguide plane , and @xmath12 is the excitonic polarization scaled to be in the same units as @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 are the photon and the exciton coherence decay rates and @xmath14 is the rate of the light matter coupling . for plane - waves @xmath11 and @xmath12 proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a propagation constant offset from @xmath4 and @xmath17 is a frequency offset from @xmath6 , the lossless dispersion law is @xmath18 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19mev is the energy splitting between the two polariton branches at @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the gvd parameter @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the gvd is normal ( i.e. @xmath22 ) for pulses with central frequency @xmath23 detuned down from the resonance ( @xmath24 ) towards the lower polariton branch and anomalous ( @xmath25 ) otherwise . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> the pulse central ( carrier ) frequency @xmath26 varies from @xmath27mev to @xmath28mev , so that we operate on the part of the lower polariton branch where the polaritons are between 74% and 84% photonic and @xmath29 is between 400 and 1000 ps@xmath0 m@xmath1 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) .    within our experimental and theoretical frameworks </S>",
    "<S> we study both quasi - one dimensional effects when diffraction along @xmath9 is not important and two - dimensional effects , when diffraction is relevant for the physics of the process . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , the system under consideration is similar to the equations used to study gap solitons @xcite and solitons with dispersion provided by material resonances of different physical origin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the latter type of solitons has mostly been studied theoretically and the experimental studies have been focused on so - called self - induced transparency solitons in atomic gases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spatio - temporal solitons are a separate large area of research , where the most convincing experimental measurements of quasi - solitonic effects have been demonstrated in @xmath30 crystals with very challenging dispersion control @xcite and in arrays of coupled waveguides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previous efforts to use nanophotonic systems to observe spatio - temporal effects @xcite have not been very successful .        </S>",
    "<S> we proceed by describing our results on observation of one dimensional temporal solitons . </S>",
    "<S> we first present experimental measurements which demonstrate temporal soliton formation and then confirm this by comparing the data with numerical modelling . </S>",
    "<S> dependencies of the output pulse width vs total output pulse energy are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_temporal_results]a ) for several detunings of the central pulse frequency from the exciton , @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the detector resolution causes the incident 350fs pulse to be measured as 2.0ps . below a threshold pulse energy </S>",
    "<S> the measured fwhm after propagation though the waveguide is between 2.7 to 4.2 ps depending on @xmath23 , which indicates significant temporal speading due to the group velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_temporal_results]a ) shows the temporal profile of the pulse collected from the output grating for pulse energies above and below the threshold . </S>",
    "<S> one should note that the pulse shape is highly asymmetric below threshold and becomes symmetric above threshold . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_temporal_results]b ) shows the corresponding output spectral widths while the inset shows pulse spectra above and below threshold . for low pulse energies </S>",
    "<S> the output spectrum reflects that of the incident pulse slightly modified by the frequency dependent coupling efficiency of the grating coupler ( see inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the pulse energy is increased above threshold the pulse becomes significantly shorter and more symmetrical in time until , for the strongest pulses , the measured fwhm reaches a minimum between 2.4ps and 2.7ps , depending on @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time the spectrum shows strong narrowing about the central frequency reaching values in the range 1.8 to 2.3mev , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_temporal_results]b ) . during this process </S>",
    "<S> the total power collected from the output grating remains linear with pump power to within a few percent indicating that the spectral and temporal compression are due to a coherent transfer of energy between frequency components rather than a nonlinear absorption or filtering effect . </S>",
    "<S> such coherent spectral and temporal compressions occuring at a critical input energy and levelling off with further energy increase are characteristic of the transition from dispersive propagation to soliton formation .        </S>",
    "<S> another key signature of soliton formation is linearisation of the soliton dispersion relation resulting in a single group velocity for all soliton components . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] shows the time of flight of different wavevector components of the pulse above and below threshold . </S>",
    "<S> below threshold the time of flight is simply determined by the polariton dispersion relation with polaritons close to resonance travelling slower , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) . above threshold </S>",
    "<S> , however , there is a very clear departure from this trend . to within the experimental error </S>",
    "<S> the time of flight becomes constant with wavevector across the range where there is significant intensity . </S>",
    "<S> this should be compared with a difference of 4ps over the same wavevector range below threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion is therefore cancelled out above threshold confirming the formation of a soliton . </S>",
    "<S> the soliton velocity of 39 @xmath2 m ps@xmath1 is faster than that of linearly propagating polaritons at the same energies but significantly slower than the 58 @xmath2 m ps@xmath1 expected for uncoupled photons . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the strong light - matter coupling is preserved during the propagation of the high power pulse . </S>",
    "<S> to summarise , the experimental evidence for soliton formation consists of strong coherent temporal and spectral narrowing of the output pulses at a critical energy and a strong reduction in the spread of velocities among different wavenumber components of the pulses .    </S>",
    "<S> soliton formation requires the characteristic length scale @xmath31 for the buildup of nonlinear phase to be comparable to the dispersion length . here , @xmath32350fs is the pulse width , @xmath33 is the characteristic pulse energy for the soliton formation and @xmath34 is the nonlinear waveguide parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion length is given by @xmath35 m where @xmath36 is the @xmath37 pulse half width . </S>",
    "<S> we note that solitons in any lossy system will lose intensity as they propagate with a characteristic loss length @xmath38400@xmath2 m in our system . </S>",
    "<S> provided that @xmath39 the nonlinearity will adiabatically adjust the pulse width to compensate the loss and solitons may still be expected . from these considerations we now estimate the effective nonlinear refractive index in our system . taking the threshold pulse energy at the waveguide exit as 100fj and @xmath40 400@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> m we estimate @xmath41fj at the input . setting @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath43 -18,000/(wm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this may be related to the nonlinear refractive index by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the vacuum wavenumber and @xmath46 6.6 @xmath2m@xmath0 is the effective mode area  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore obtain @xmath47 - 1.6x10@xmath48 m@xmath0w@xmath1 . this is more than three orders of magnitude larger than 6x10@xmath49 m@xmath0w@xmath1 in silicon  @xciteand ingap  @xcite which have recently been used in a suspended membrane photonic crystal geometry in two of the most promising demonstrations of solitons for integrated optics until now . in those systems solitons </S>",
    "<S> are formed at pulse energies of 12pj for ingap  @xcite and 9pj for silicon  @xcite which are 1.3 - 1.4 orders of magnitude higher than in our system . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in those works the effective mode areas are smaller ( @xmath500.5@xmath2m@xmath0 ) and the dispersion lengths are much longer ( 3.6 mm and 1 mm ) than in our system both of which can be used to reduce the threshold , the latter at the expense of increased circuit size .        </S>",
    "<S> figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theory](a , b ) show numerically computed time domain and spectral pulse profiles vs pulse energy at the end of the waveguide under the assumption that loss is neglected . by tracing the evolution of the pulse along the waveguide </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed that exact temporal solitons are excited for pulse energies above @xmath51fj . </S>",
    "<S> experimental values of the losses introduced into the modeling modify the pulse dynamics only quantitatively , see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theory](c , d ) . </S>",
    "<S> they accelerate pulse broadening and shift the threshold for formation of solitons towards higher energies , @xmath52fj . figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theory](e , f ) show evolution of the pulse profile along the waveguide with the real losses below ( e ) and above ( f ) the soliton formation threshold . for every profile shown in </S>",
    "<S> ( f ) the red curves indicate a matching analytical soliton solution , see methods , thus confirming that we are dealing with adiabatically decaying solitons . for comparison with experimental results , </S>",
    "<S> the modelled dependencies of the temporal and spectral widths of the output pulses on pulse energy are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_temporal_results](c , d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 2ps resolution of the streak camera has been included in the temporal widths . as in the experimental case </S>",
    "<S> there is a temporal compression of up to 1ps depending on detuning which occurs over a few tens of femto - joules pulse energy . </S>",
    "<S> also as in the experiment the spectral widths reduce by @xmath50 2mev over the same pulse energy range . this good semi - quantitative agreement between experiment and theoretical soliton solutions </S>",
    "<S> futher confirms the observation of temporal solitons .    </S>",
    "<S> we now shift our attention to the conditions where diffraction in the transverse direction is important . </S>",
    "<S> since the polariton - polariton interaction is repulsive , corresponding to defocussing nonlinearity , a gaussian beam is expected to exhibit enhanced diffraction as the power increases . as well as this defocussing the system </S>",
    "<S> is also expected to support dark spatial solitons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , these consist of a high intensity background extending to infinity in the direction transverse to propagation with a dark notch at the centre whose width is defined by the background intensity . in analogy to temporal solitons the fundamental spatial soliton is formed when the nonlinear length matches the diffraction length so that diffraction is balanced by self phase modulation . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsically large gvd in our system makes the dispersion and diffraction lengths comparable so that both may be compensated at the same low pulse energy and thus form spatio - temporal solitons . before proceeding </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that if transverse effects are undesirable for a particular application they may be removed simply by employing transverse confinement such as a waveguide ridge . </S>",
    "<S> staying in the planar geometry , the excitation beam transverse profile was modified to excite a dark soliton following the approach used in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the initially gaussian beam was passed through a thin - film phase plate in order to introduce a @xmath53 phase jump at its centre . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity distribution at the input grating then consisted of two bright lobes with a dip in intensity between them where the phase is discontinuous .        </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : bright_dark ] shows the width of the full distribution and of the dark notch measured at the output grating as a function of pulse energy . </S>",
    "<S> the upper inset of the figure shows the transverse profile for high and low powers . as the power </S>",
    "<S> is increased the total width of the distribution increases by 6 microns due to nonlinear defocussing as expected . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the width of the intensity notch decreases by 5 microns . </S>",
    "<S> a simple defocussing effect would be expected to enhance the diffraction of the notch as well as the sidelobes . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the notch narrows indicates that we form a dark soliton . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the combination of sidelobe broadening and notch narrowing represents the distribution gradually approaching that of the ideal dark soliton as the nonlinear interaction becomes important . at the same powers as the spatial soliton forms the temporal duration decreases from 4.7ps to 3.6ps . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have observed clear experimental signatures of spatio - temporal dark - bright solitons . </S>",
    "<S> these solitons have been previously studied only theoretically@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also numerically modeled formation of these solitons and found our results to be in very good agreement with the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the numerically computed transverse widths are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bright_dark]b ) . as in the experimental case </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear interaction widens the total distribution and narrows the dark notch by several microns with the rate of change of width increasing with power . </S>",
    "<S> the good semi - quantiative agreement of these trends again confirms that the experiment observes spatio - temporal solitons .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated formation of picosecond light - matter solitons with unprecedented low pulse energy density . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied both temporal and spatio - temporal nonlinear effects and observed the dark - bright spatio - temporal soliton for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the solitons exist in a novel regime where intrinsically large dispersion is balanced by a nonlinearity several orders of magnitude larger than in any other ultrafast system . </S>",
    "<S> these properties allow nonlinear phases to accumulate and be controlled over short distances consistent with on - chip applications at low power . </S>",
    "<S> the waveguide exciton - polariton system therefore represents an important platform for high speed integrated optics requiring large nonlinearity . </S>"
