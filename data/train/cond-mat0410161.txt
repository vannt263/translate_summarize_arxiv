    "the superconducting flux qubit is a superconducting loop broken by one or more josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "the junctions are designed so that the lowest two quantum eigenstates are states with opposite magnetic flux .",
    "the flux can range from a tiny @xmath4 fraction of the flux quantum @xcite to @xmath5 of the quantum @xcite .",
    "the two states span a two - dimensional hilbert space of the qubit .",
    "i assume convention that the state @xmath6 with positive(negative ) flux is the @xmath7 eigenstate of @xmath8 .",
    "degeneracy of these two states is removed by coherent tunneling between the opposite flux states driven by the qubit hamiltonian : @xmath9 for @xmath10 the eigenstates of @xmath11 are the coherent superpositions of opposite magnetic fluxes @xmath12 these schrdinger cats were observed in two independent experiments @xcite . for @xmath10",
    "the qubit hamiltonian ( [ hq ] ) drives coherent oscillations between the states with opposite flux .",
    "for example , the initial state @xmath13 evolves into @xmath14 with an expectation value of the flux operator @xmath15 oscillating with the rabi frequency @xmath1 .",
    "damped flux oscillations were observed in a number of experiments @xcite in both types of the superconducting qubit .",
    "the qubit hamiltonian ( [ hq ] ) is sufficient to perform any one - qubit operation .",
    "two - qubit operations are possible thanks to inductive coupling between any two qubits @xcite .",
    "entangled eigenstates of two qubits were detected in ref.@xcite and coherent rabi oscillations in a system of two inductively coupled qubits were observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is possible to perform single - qubit not and two - qubit cnot operations in an adiabatic way @xcite that , in particular , precludes excitation beyond the truncated two - dimensional hilbert space of the qubit .",
    "however , before it comes to quantum computation quantum decoherence has to be overcome first .",
    "various sources of decoherence for flux qubits have been discussed in ref.@xcite . at relatively high temperatures the main source of decoherence",
    "are normal state quasiparticles .",
    "however , density of quasiparticles is exponentially suppressed at temperatures much less than the critical temperature .",
    "other decoherence mechanisms including electromagnetic radiation from the qubit or ohmic dissipation in the environment are respectively negligible or tractable .",
    "nuclear spins are argued to play a minor role . due to relaxation",
    "the spins randomly flip their polarization .",
    "random spins are a source of random magnetic field which couples to the magnetic moment of the qubit and randomizes its quantum state .",
    "this picture is further corroborated in ref.@xcite where the spins are assumed to be mutually non - interacting but each of them is coupled to a bosonic environment .",
    "the decoherence time is estimated in the range of miliseconds .",
    "the final eq.(47 ) in ref.@xcite shows that in the limit of vanishing nuclear spin relaxation rate ( @xmath16 in ref.@xcite ) the decoherence time tends to infinity .",
    "as expected , the external magnetic noise vanishes for vanishing nuclear spin relaxation rate .",
    "however , apart from generating magnetic noise nuclear spins can be also silent witnesses of the quantum state of the qubit . in the limit of vanishing spin relaxation and for negligible spin - spin interaction each spin is simply precessing in the magnetic field of the qubit .",
    "the direction of the field and the direction of the precession depend on the state of the qubit . this way the spins can learn the quantum state of the qubit .",
    "once they know the state any quantum coherence between the states with opposite flux is lost .",
    "this elementary argument shows that decoherence does not vanish for vanishing spin relaxation .",
    "in this paper i neglect nuclear spin relaxation .",
    "when the relaxation rate is longer than any other relevant timescale , like the frequency of the rabi oscillations or frequency of the spin precession in the magnetic field of a qubit , then this is a very reasonable assumption .",
    "spin lattice relaxation is also neglected in the paper of prokofev and stamp @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the very general formalism employed in ref.@xcite , in this paper i apply most elementary methods to a simple model hamiltonian .",
    "this simple approach benefits with clear interpretation of the results and additional insights into dynamics of the decoherence process .",
    "in particular , the simple model makes it very clear that even in the absence of any spin lattice relaxation the spin environment decoheres quantum state of a single qubit .",
    "the decoherence is not an artifact of ensemble average over different static spin configurations or an ensemble of qubits , as sometimes claimed in the literature , but a result of genuine entanglement between the qubit and the spins .",
    "the qubit interacting with spins is described by a hamiltonian @xmath17 here @xmath18 is interaction between the qubit and @xmath19 spins @xmath20 @xmath21 is a magnetic field of the qubit in the state @xmath13 at the position @xmath22 of the @xmath23-th spin .",
    "direction of the magnetic field is reversed in the state @xmath24 as is accounted for by the operator @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath25 is a vector of pauli matrices @xmath26 in the hilbert space of the @xmath23-th spin .",
    "a unitary transformation in the hilbert space of each spin brings the interaction hamiltonian to a more convenient form @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the strength of the qubit magnetic field at the location of the @xmath23-th spin .",
    "when the magnetic field from the qubit is stronger than magnetic fields from other spins , then spin - spin interaction can be neglected , @xmath29 and @xmath30 this exactly solvable spin - spin model was also considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be easily diagonalized .",
    "the spin part of any eigenstate is @xmath31 here @xmath32 is an eigenstate of @xmath33 with an eigenvalue @xmath34 . in the subspace of @xmath35",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) reduces to an effective qubit hamiltonian @xmath36 with an effective external `` magnetic field '' @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 has eigenvalues @xmath39 with corresponding eigenstates proportional to @xmath40|-\\rangle$ ] .",
    "i open discussion of decoherence with an example where the initial state is @xmath41 each spin is initially in the @xmath42 eigenstate of its @xmath43 .",
    "more general discussion is postponed to section viii , where i consider an ensemble of pure initial states . however",
    ", average over the ensemble will give the same results as the present example so all the conclusions of this section are also valid for the ensemble of spin states .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) evolves the initial state into @xmath44     \\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal a}(t,\\vec s)&= & e^{-i\\omega t}~b~   \\frac{\\alpha b-\\beta(\\frac12\\omega-\\omega)}{b^2+(\\frac12\\omega-\\omega)^2}+ \\nonumber\\\\ & & e^{+i\\omega t}~b~   \\frac{\\alpha b-\\beta(\\frac12\\omega+\\omega)}{b^2+(\\frac12\\omega+\\omega)^2}~ , \\label{a}\\\\ { \\cal b } ( t,\\vec s)&= & -e^{-i\\omega t}~   ( \\frac12\\omega-\\omega)~   \\frac{\\alpha b-\\beta(\\frac12\\omega-\\omega)}{b^2+(\\frac12\\omega-\\omega)^2}+ \\nonumber\\\\ & & -e^{+i\\omega t}~   ( \\omega+\\frac12\\omega)~   \\frac{\\alpha b-\\beta(\\frac12\\omega+\\omega)}{b^2+(\\frac12\\omega+\\omega)^2}~ , \\label{b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this state is an entangled state of the qubit and the spins : the state of the qubit @xmath45 depends on the state of spins @xmath35 .",
    "the state of the qubit can be described by reduced density matrix @xmath46 obtained by taking a partial trace over the spins : @xmath47 this matrix form is given in the basis of @xmath48 states of the qubit .",
    "@xmath46 is in general a mixed state as can be most conveniently measured by its `` quadratic entropy '' @xmath49 $ ] introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the initial state is pure , @xmath50 , but in general @xmath51 grows as the interacting qubit and spins get entangled and the state of the qubit is loosing its initial coherence .    the most right hand side of eq.([rhos ] ) can be formally interpreted as an average over all possible states of spins , or over all possible sets @xmath52 of @xmath19 independent random variables @xmath53 . in the limit of large @xmath19",
    "the effective magnetic field @xmath37 becomes a gaussian variable with a mean of @xmath54 and a variance of @xmath55 . in this limit",
    "the sum in eq.([rhos ] ) can be approximated by an integral , @xmath56 this density matrix is formally an average over different values of the static magnetic noise @xmath57 generated by different static spin configurations .",
    "the mixed state of the qubit results from an average over different pure states of the qubit , each of them evolved from the same initial state but with a different value of @xmath57 in the hamiltonian ( [ hs ] ) .",
    "however , as the derivation of eq.([rhoint ] ) demonstrates , this is not an average over different realizations of the experiment with different static configurations of nuclear spins , but it is an average over a superposition of different states of spins present in a single realization of the experiment .",
    "this is genuine decoherence due to entanglement with the spin bath .    in the following sections",
    "special cases of this exact solution are worked out in more detail .",
    "i begin with the simplest case when the frequency of rabi oscillations @xmath58 .",
    "the density matrix ( [ rhoint ] ) becomes particularly simple in the absence of flux oscillations when we can set @xmath59 and @xmath60 the products @xmath61 or @xmath62 in the density matrix ( [ rhoint ] ) contain oscillatory terms proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "the average over @xmath57 in eq.([rhoint ] ) dephases these oscillations to zero , @xmath64 after decoherence time @xmath65 it is instructive to write the density matrix ( [ rhoint ] ) in the basis of @xmath8-eigenstates @xmath66 the off - diagonal coherences between the @xmath8-eigenstates are destroyed after the decoherence time of @xmath0 when the density matrix becomes diagonal in this basis .",
    "this is not quite surprising because the @xmath8 eigenstates are eigenstates of both the interaction hamiltonian @xmath18 and the qubit hamiltonian ( @xmath58 ) - they are the ideal pointer states of ref.@xcite .",
    "quadratic entropy of the state ( [ rhoomega0 ] ) grows like @xmath67 the only case when the state of the qubit remains pure , or @xmath68 , is when the initial state is one of the @xmath8-eigenstates ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this is another fundamental property of the pointer states .",
    "when rabi oscillations are much faster than the interaction with the spin bath , then we have a small parameter @xmath70 the matrix elements in the density matrix ( [ rhoint ] ) contain oscillatory terms which can be approximated as @xmath71}~ \\label{eiomega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 . in this expansion",
    "i use the assumption ( [ epsilon2 ] ) that @xmath73 .",
    "assuming further that the bias @xmath54 is weak as compared to @xmath1 , @xmath74 the density matrix can be approximated by its leading order term in both @xmath54 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 with the coherence function @xmath77 this function comes from an average of the approximate ( [ eiomega ] ) over the gaussian variable @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath78 has two time scales @xmath79 both of them are much longer than the decoherence time @xmath0 in the absence of rabi oscillations .",

    "the exact solution ( [ rhorabi ] ) can be best understood in limiting cases .    for times",
    "@xmath82 the coherence function can be approximated by @xmath83 and the coherence decay is characterized by the power laws : @xmath84~. \\label{ftau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apart from the shift in the frequency of oscillations , in the regime of @xmath82 the coherence decay does not depend on @xmath85 .",
    "this power law decay of flux oscillations was also derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "both the entropy growth and the decay of flux oscillations are due to the decay of the same coherence function @xmath78 in the density matrix ( [ rhorabi ] ) .",
    "thus , contrary to ref.@xcite , it is not possible to see oscillations after decay of quantum coherence : flux oscillations are coherent flux oscillations .    when @xmath86 the coherence function is @xmath87 and the decay of coherence is gaussian : @xmath88 when the bias @xmath54 is stronger than the influence of spins , @xmath89 , then @xmath90 and the gaussian decay of coherence is completed before crossover to the power law decay after @xmath3 . for a weak bias , @xmath91 ,",
    "the coherence decay is a power law .",
    "the coherence decays most slowly when the bias @xmath10 .",
    "the power law ( [ ftau ] ) and gaussian ( [ fmu ] ) decays are consistent with the decays derived in ref.@xcite from a model with a non - markovian external noise , compare also ref.@xcite . here",
    ", these results follow from a microscopic description of quantum decoherence in a bath of non - interacting spins .",
    "after decoherence the density matrix ( [ rhorabi ] ) becomes diagonal in the basis of @xmath92-eigenstates .",
    "what is more the entropy remains zero , @xmath68 , only when @xmath93 or @xmath94 i.e. when the initial state of the qubit is an eigenstate of @xmath92 .",
    "this is not quite surprising because when @xmath11 dominates over @xmath18 and @xmath95 , then the eigenstates of @xmath11 are expected to be the pointer states @xcite .",
    "the density matrix ( [ rhorabi ] ) is the leading order term in the expansion of the exact density matrix ( [ rhoint ] ) in powers of @xmath96 . in this section",
    "i include higher order terms .",
    "for the sake of simplicity i consider only the optimal case of zero bias when @xmath10 .",
    "the products @xmath62 etc . in the exact density matrix ( [ rhoint ] ) are expanded up to second order in powers of @xmath97 .",
    "the oscillatory factors @xmath98 are approximated as in eq.([eiomega ] ) .",
    "after these two approximations the gaussian integral over @xmath57 in eq.([rhoint ] ) gives the approximate density matrix accurate up to second order in @xmath99 @xmath100 with matrix elements @xmath101~ , \\nonumber\\\\ c(t)&= & \\alpha^*\\beta z(t)e^{i\\omega t}+ \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac14 \\epsilon^2\\left(\\alpha^*\\beta+{\\rm c.c.}\\right ) \\left[2-e^{i\\omega t}z^3(t)\\right]-   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac14 \\epsilon^2\\left[\\alpha^*\\beta e^{i\\omega t}z^3(t)+{\\rm c.c.}\\right]~. \\label{c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) is a probability to find the qubit in the state @xmath104 ( or @xmath105 ) and @xmath106 is quantum coherence between these states .",

    "this fluctuating entropy means partial loss of coherence .",
    "this partial early time decoherence also shows in flux oscillations .",
    "the initial state @xmath113 leads to flux oscillations @xmath114 unlike the coherent flux oscillation between @xmath42 and @xmath115 in eq.([osc ] ) this flux oscillates between @xmath42 and @xmath116 , see fig.2 .",
    "the amplitude of the coherent oscillation is reduced due to the partial decoherence .",
    "the oscillation is also biased towards the initial positive value of @xmath117 .",
    "similar effect was also predicted recently in the spin - boson model @xcite .",
    "here it follows from the simple and explicitly solvable spin - spin model .",
    "the effect seems to be generic feature of a non - markovian environment .",
    "fast rabi oscillations make the time of full decoherence @xmath3 much longer than the decoherence time @xmath0 without rabi oscillations .",
    "when the flux oscillates many times before the spins can learn its orientation , then it takes the spins much longer time to learn the state of the qubit than in the static case . on a long timescale covering many flux oscillations",
    "the oscillating magnetic field measured by the spins effectively averages out to zero .",
    "this is the key idea of the quantum bang - bang control introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , this argument does not apply before the first period of oscillation is completed . on this short timescale",
    "the magnetic field of the qubit is effectively static and during this short time the spins have a chance to get a rough idea about its orientation .",
    "the spins more or less realize that the initial flux in eq.([fluxearly ] ) is @xmath42 and this fuzzy knowledge biases the following oscillations in @xmath118 towards this positive value .",
    "the state of the qubit is partially `` collapsed '' towards the state with positive flux .",
    "this qualitative argument becomes more substantial when we take as an initial state the equal superpositon of states with opposite flux @xmath104 ( or @xmath119 ) and compare the two expressions for entropy , one valid for fast rabi oscillations ( [ sepsilon ] ) at an early time long before the first period of oscillations is completed i.e. for @xmath120 , and the other in the absence of any oscillations ( [ somega0 ] ) . for such early times",
    "both formulas are the same , @xmath121 demonstrating that the early time partial decoherence takes place on the timescale @xmath0 as if there were no rabi oscillations at all .",
    "fast rabi oscillations postpone full decoherence after @xmath3 but they do not prevent partial decoherence already after @xmath0 .",
    "this effect may affect scallability of the superconducting flux qubit technology .",
    "the partial loss of coherence @xmath122 is small in a single qubit , but it scales together with the number of qubits @xmath123 as @xmath124 and limits the number of qubits to @xmath125 obviously , this upper bound does not apply when quantum error correction is performed much faster than @xmath0 .",
    "so far the initial state of spins was a special pure state . in this section",
    "i assume the unbiased initial ensemble of all possible spins states described the unit density matrix of spins @xmath126 .",
    "the initial state of the qubit and the spins is @xmath127 the unit matrix @xmath126 can be expressed in any basis of spins states but a representation @xmath128 most directly leads to the reduced density matrix of the qubit @xmath129 this density matrix is identical with the density matrix ( [ rhos ] ) obtained from the initial pure state in eq.([psi0 ] ) .",
    "all the results derived from the pure state pass without any modification to the ensemble .",
    "the initial state @xmath126 can be also interpreted as a high temperature thermal state of nuclear spins .",
    "in this section i attempt to make some numerical estimates . for example , in the qubit design considered in ref.@xcite the parameters are estimated as : @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "these numbers lead to @xmath133s , @xmath134 , and @xmath135s . in the best case of @xmath136",
    "one can see @xmath137 of coherent flux oscillations before the decoherence time @xmath3 .",
    "thus it is possible to see hundreds of oscillations as in the experiments @xcite .",
    "for the same parameters the fast partial decoherence limits the number of qubits to @xmath138 .",
    "these numbers leave , however , an encouraging room for current experiments .",
    "the environment of spins is a witness to the quantum state of the superconducting flux qubit .",
    "the qubit gets entangled with spins after a decoherence time @xmath0 .",
    "coherent flux oscillations driven by the qubit hamiltonian postpone full decoherence after a much longer time @xmath3 , but they do not prevent partial decoherence already after @xmath0 .",
