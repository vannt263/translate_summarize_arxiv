    "the lyman - alpha emission line ( @xmath0 ) at 1216   fulfills several extremely important roles in observations of the high - redshift ( @xmath4 ) universe .",
    "recombination nebulae re - process @xmath5 of the raw ionizing power of hot stars into a single emission line which acts as a luminous spectral beacon by which to identify galaxies at the highest redshifts ( see , e.g. , hayes etal .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "further , at the highest redshift it provides the potential for the all - important spectroscopic confirmation of distant galaxies selected by other methods , transforming the status of candidates to objects with secure redshifts ( e.g. , stark etal .  2010 ) .",
    "@xmath0  is a resonance line and is readily scattered by neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "this scattering may occur in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxies themselves , or in the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) that immediately surrounds them .",
    "scattering in the cgm can lead to extended @xmath0  structures such as those found in high - z @xmath0  emitters ( lae ) by @xcite and @xcite among others . inside the ism ,",
    "the radiative transport of @xmath0  depends strongly on dust extinction @xcite .",
    "this dependence , however , shows large scatter due to the complicated resonant scattering of @xmath0 , in which the visibility of the line is influenced by a large number of factors , including dust content ( charlot & fall 1993 ; verhamme etal .",
    "2008 ; atek etal .  2009",
    "; hayes etal .  2010 ) , dust geometry ( scarlata etal .",
    "2009 ) , neutral gas content and kinematics ( kunth etal .  1998 ; mas - hesse etal .  2003 ; cannon etal .",
    "2004 ) , and gas geometry ( neufeld 1991 ; giavalisco etal .  1996 ;",
    "hansen & oh 2006 ; laursen et al .",
    "2013 ; duval et al .",
    "taken together , these myriad factors indicate that the true total escape fraction of @xmath0  photons ( @xmath6 ; defined as the ratio of observed to intrinsic @xmath0  luminosity ; hayes etal .",
    "2005 , hayes etal .",
    "2013 ) , is still poorly understood .",
    "thus , photometric measurements of @xmath0  will reflect the underlying properties of galaxies only in the very broadest statistical sense .",
    "the only way to remedy this complicated situation is to study the @xmath0  emission line in a sample of star - forming galaxies on a spatially resolved basis . from the uv perspective , obtaining @xmath0  images in the nearby universe is expensive and requires space - based platforms . to this end",
    ", our team has acquired data from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to produce @xmath0  images of a statistically selected sample of star - forming galaxies in the low-@xmath4 universe ( see stlin etal .",
    "2014 ) ; details about the image processing methods can be found in hayes etal .",
    "this program , called the `` lyman alpha reference sample '' ( `` lars '' ) , includes hst cycle 18 imaging and cycle 19 spectroscopic observations of 14 galaxies .",
    "these hst datasets form the backbone of a comprehensive multi - wavelength observational campaign that will allow great strides forward in our understanding of @xmath0  radiative transport .",
    "since the lars sample is selected on uv luminosity and h@xmath7  equivalent width , and not on @xmath0  characteristics , the composite sample was designed to overlap with both high-@xmath4 and low-@xmath4 star - forming galaxies .",
    "lars will form a critical local interpretive benchmark for studies of high-@xmath4 galaxies for decades to come , and is well placed to take advantage of the remaining hst lifetime and motivate future observations with jwst .    the lars program ( including sample selection )",
    "is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite , hereafter referred to as papers i and ii respectively .",
    "preliminary results derived from the @xmath0  images of the lars galaxies are presented in @xcite .",
    "that work showed that in many lars galaxies , @xmath0  emission is prominent on physical scales that exceed those of both the massive stellar populations and the star formation regions that give rise to the @xmath0  photons ; this trend is very prominent in the panels of figures  [ fig_opta ] , [ fig_optb ] , and [ fig_optc ] , which show optical and uv images of the lars galaxies .",
    "this may point towards @xmath0  photons being resonantly scattered to large radii in most of the lars galaxies , although other possibilities have been proposed , such as ionization caused by hot plasma @xcite .",
    "it is likely that multiple of the aforementioned physical properties ( dust content and geometry , neutral gas content , kinematics , geometry ) are facilitating this efficient resonant scattering .    in order to decouple the effects of dust and neutral gas kinematics and densities ,",
    "the @xmath0  images must be compared with spatially resolved information about the neutral ism .",
    "while uv and optical absorption line spectroscopy offers one avenue to address this issue , such data are limited to those regions in the foreground of only the brightest continuum sources ( usually the emission line nebulae themselves ) . while our team is pursuing such analyses ( see rivera - thorsen etal .",
    ", in preparation , and @xmath0  profile modeling from orlitova etal .",
    ", in preparation ) , these avenues should be complemented by direct probes of the neutral interstellar medium in all regions of the lars galaxies . to this end , in this manuscript we begin a detailed exploration of the neutral hydrogen in the lars galaxies by presenting new single - dish hi spectroscopy and spatially resolved interferometric h  i  imaging .",
    "we use these data to derive global properties and to study the properties of the h  i  gas on bulk scales .",
    "previous spatially resolved h  i  observations of galaxies in which @xmath0  radiative transport has been studied in detail are few . while the sample of systems with spectroscopic information about @xmath0  is robust , there are comparatively few systems that have direct @xmath0  imaging ( see the discussion in hayes etal .",
    "2005 , hayes etal .",
    "2009 , stlin etal .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "for those systems that do , there has , until the present work , been no systematic investigation of the h  i  on a spatially resolved basis ; only a few selected systems have detailed h  i  studies in the literature .",
    "@xcite presented h  i  observations of two of the most well - studied and nearby @xmath0-emitting galaxies in the local universe , eso338@xmath8ig004 ( tol1924@xmath8416 ) and iras 08339 + 6517 .",
    "in each galaxy , extended neutral gas connects the target and nearby neighbors , suggesting that interactions have played an important role in triggering the massive starbursts in eso338@xmath8ig004 and iras 08339 + 6517 .",
    "the close proximity of the companions suggests that the interactions were recent . since both primary systems are @xmath0  emitters , these data support two possible interpretations of @xmath0  escape from starburst galaxies : either a ) the bulk ism kinematics provides the means of escape for @xmath0  photons by shifting h  i  atoms out of resonance , or b ) the h  i  is sufficiently clumpy on scales below our resolution to allow for efficient @xmath0  escape .",
    "these interpretations are further supported by h  i  @xcite and @xmath0  observations @xcite of eso400-g43 .    in this work , we begin to extend this type of analysis to the entire lars sample .",
    "basic properties of the lars galaxies are summarized in table  [ table_basic ] .",
    "figures  [ fig_opta ] , [ fig_optb ] , and [ fig_optc ] show optical and uv images of the 14 lars galaxies , with the left and right columns displaying the color hst images and the sdss color images respectively .",
    "the right column includes the immediate surroundings , while the left column has smaller fields of view , and are scaled to show detail in the galaxies .",
    "we organize this manuscript as follows . in   [ s2 ]",
    "we describe the data acquisition , reduction , and analysis .",
    "  [ s3 ] presents the single - dish h  i  profiles of the 14 lars galaxies , while   [ s4 ]",
    "presents spatially resolved h  i  images of 5 of the 14 lars systems .",
    "we discuss each system individually in",
    "  [ s5 ] , and discuss various correlations between galaxy global properties in   [ s6 ] .",
    "we draw our conclusions in   [ s7 ] . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the value of h@xmath9 @xmath10 70@xmath111.4 kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 from the averaged wmap 7 year data as presented in @xcite .",
    "we obtained data from the national radio astronomy observatory 100 m robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) under program gbt/11a-057 ( legacy i d qo13 ; p.i .",
    "data were acquired in four observing sessions in march and april of 2011 .",
    "position switching observations were performed for all sources ; 32,768 channels over the 12.5 mhz of total bandwidth produce a spectral resolution of 381.469 hz ( 0.08 kms@xmath12ch@xmath12 ) .",
    "all reductions were performed in the idl environment , using the gbtidl package designed at nrao .",
    "we first imported the raw data for each galaxy into gbtidl using standard averaging techniques , with zenith opacity coming from atmospheric data from the nrao cleo weather system .",
    "the data was moderately contaminated by terrestrial radio frequency interference ( rfi ) ; bad data were identified by examining individual spectra , blanked , and interpolated .",
    "the standard position switching algorithms in gbtidl were used to produce a combined spectrum for each galaxy . to increase the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of the observations we first averaged the reference spectrum by 16 channels .",
    "this procedure can have a negative effect on the baseline shape , increasing the order of the polynomial ( often 3rd order ) that we used to fit and subtract the continuum ( see table  [ table_gbt_props ] for the order of the fit for each galaxy ) .",
    "the snr was quite low on most of the lars galaxies and we thus smoothed our spectrum by 256 channels resulting in a velocity resolution of @xmath13 20kms@xmath12 .",
    "flux and width measurements were taken on this smoothed profile .",
    "two regions were selected by hand for each galaxy : the first around the profile , and the second in an area free from rfi ( used as an rms noise region ) .",
    "the redshifts of the lars galaxies ( see table [ table_basic ] ) place some of them in proximity to a bandpass filter in the 1.2 - 1.3 ghz region .",
    "this bandpass filter is designed to shield against a local radar signal , but contributes higher than usual system temperature ( t@xmath14 ) values ( and therefore system noise ) to calibrated data in this frequency range .",
    "further , the t@xmath14 values fluctuated markedly from one spectral scan to the next .",
    "the affected galaxies were all non detections ( lars12 , lars13 , and lars14 ) and have markedly higher t@xmath14 values ( in particular lars13 ) than would otherwise be expected .",
    "it should also be noted that these three galaxies are at the largest redshifts in our sample .    systematically measuring the flux and width of irregular , low snr , h  i  spectra can be challenging .",
    "to do so , we have modified previously well known measurement techniques and find that they are robust over the range of snr and profile shapes in our data .",
    "our measurement routines take as inputs the smoothed spectrum and the region suspected of containing the galaxy . in our initial tests of archival data for ngc 5291 ( available in the distribution of gbtidl )",
    ", we found that hand selecting regions of the profile could add additional bias , causing the width and flux measurements to vary by 2 - 5% .",
    "instead , we opted to use @xmath15 minimization techniques to fit gaussian components ( a single component fit for galaxies with a single peak and a multi component fit for double - horned profiles ) to the smoothed spectrum .",
    "these components were used to guide later analysis and ensured repeatability in our results even with low snr .",
    "these gaussian fits serve only to guide analysis , however , and the flux and width measurements follow the methodology described in @xcite .",
    "this method fits lines to the profile in the region over which it varies the most ( here between 15% and 85% of the peak value ) and measures width properties from these fits .",
    "@xcite found that this reduced the dependence on noise on their measurements versus direct measurements .",
    "we modified this method to respond better to low snr values and to handle single peaked data more accurately .",
    "we consider this method to be the `` best representation '' of the width measurements for these spectra , although it is not the only method ( e.g. , the busy function ; * ? ? ?",
    "we recorded two snrs based on the peak - to - rms ratio and on the integrated flux to integrated rms ratio .",
    "the flux accuracy of gbt data using standard reduction techniques is quoted as 10% in the gbtidl calibration guide .",
    "the primary error terms are the rms fluctuations of the spectra in the region around the target and the subjectivity of selecting the baseline regions and rms / profile regions .",
    "in testing it was seen that increasing the order of the baseline generally led to increasing error .",
    "we thus adopt a 10% flux error for `` good '' profiles and a conservative 20% for `` irregular '' profiles .",
    "special attention was paid to the error terms presented in @xcite as modified from @xcite . the error term given",
    "there adds an error associated with the quality of the baseline fit .",
    "because we have assumed a separate baseline error , we remove this term to get a more or less standard error term : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the noise in units of jy kms@xmath12 , and w is the area of integration for the profile .",
    "the width at 50% of the maximum value ( w@xmath18 ) results reported are highly dependent on the accuracy of the method described in @xcite which , as mentioned in the above discussion , breaks down at lower snrs .",
    "the error for the width and systemic velocity measurements is based on the equations found in @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 this equation is doubled to give the error of the width measurements w@xmath20 and w@xmath18 , which refer to the width at 20% and 50% of the maximum , respectively .",
    "we obtained d - configuration very large array h  i  spectral line imaging of five lars galaxies under program vla/13a-181 ( legacy i d ac1123 ; p.i .",
    "these data were obtained with a standard widar correlator configuration that provides 16 mhz of total bandwidth .",
    "1,024 channels deliver a native spectral resolution of 3.3 kms@xmath12 .",
    "the data were acquired in march and april of 2013 , during seven observing sessions ; details are summarized in table  [ table_vlaobs ] .",
    "data reductions followed standard prescriptions in casa and in aips . the wide bandwidth and",
    "frequency range of these observations resulted in a significant amount of radio frequency interference that was removed from the data .",
    "bandpass and flux calibrations were derived using either 3c147 or 3c286 ( see table  [ table_vlaobs ] ) .",
    "the gains and phases were then calibrated using observations of the phase calibrators , which were typically separated by @xmath1320 minutes of on - source integration time . the wide bandwidth allowed for hundreds of channels of line - free continuum to be fit and subtracted . for lars02 and lars09 , which each had two separate observing sessions , we combined the separate observations into a single dataset for each galaxy .",
    "the calibrated data were then inverted and cleaned using the clean algorithms in casa . to maximize snr , the datasets for lars04 and lars08",
    "were spectrally smoothed to a final velocity resolution of 10 kms@xmath12 .",
    "a gaussian uvtaper was applied to produce cubes with beam sizes of @xmath13 1 ; the resulting cubes were then convolved to circular beam sizes . the beam sizes and rms noises of the final datacubes are summarized in table  [ table_vla_props ] .",
    "moment maps were derived using standard blanking procedures .",
    "first , each datacube was spatially smoothed to a circular beam size that is larger than the original .",
    "the resulting smoothed cube was then blanked at the 2.5@xmath21 level , where @xmath21 is the rms noise in line - free channels of the cube .",
    "this blanked cube is then inspected by hand , and only features that are spatially coincident across two or more consecutive channels are deemed to be real emission and kept in the final blanked cube .",
    "this cube is then used as a blanking mask against the original , unconvolved cube .",
    "moment maps are then derived using standard procedures .",
    "we assume a 10% uncertainty on the overall calibration and absolute flux scale of the vla images .",
    "it is important to emphasize that all of the lars galaxies are at distances of more than 100 mpc ( z@xmath22 @xmath23 0.028 ; see table  [ table_basic ] ) ; even with angular resolutions that are exquisite for h  i  work ( e.g. , 5  @xmath10 2.4 kpc at a distance of 100 mpc ) , we are sensitive only to the bulk h  i  properties of the neutral gas in these galaxies . as such ,",
    "the vla images presented here are used only to study the global morphology and large - scale h  i  kinematics .",
    "a detailed study of the h  i  on finer physical scales will require deep observations in more extended array configurations .",
    "we use global @xmath0  data for all 14 lars galaxies as presented in paper i and paper ii . the hst data were obtained with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) and advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) using h@xmath7 and h@xmath24 filters , and a combination of u , b , and i bands for fuv continuum imaging .",
    "we also acquired data with the solar blind channel using a bandpass designed to isolate @xmath0  emission .",
    "we reduced imaging data using multidrizzle in the standard hst pipelines and used the _ lyman - alpha extraction software _ ( laxs ) @xcite to continuum subtract the @xmath0  uv data .",
    "we refer the reader to paper i and ii for details of this process .",
    "the final global properties ( see paper i and table  [ table_uv_properties ] ) are measured within apertures that correspond to twice the petrosian radius .",
    "this reduces the effect of noise on the measurements at large radii .",
    "presented in figure  [ fig_gbt1 ] are the fully smoothed and reduced gbt h  i  profiles of the lars galaxies . plotted over these",
    "are the gaussian fits in gray , solid lines in red showing the sides of the profile used in the peak w@xmath25 calculations , and the peak w@xmath25 line itself shown as a horizontal blue dotted line .",
    "a discussion of each galaxy is included below .",
    "the observed properties from our gbt observations of each galaxy can be found in table  [ table_gbt_props ] along with properties derived from these using methods described below .",
    "the distances of each galaxy are calculated from the standard lars luminosity distances .",
    "the h  i  mass in units of m@xmath3 is calculated via @xmath26 where d is the distance in mpc and s@xmath27 is the h  i  flux integral in units of jy kms@xmath12 .",
    "we will discuss the mass value for each galaxy in section [ s5 ] .",
    "overall we find that our detections and mass estimates show a strong dependence on distance .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the 8  primary beam of the gbt at 21 cm is sensitive to all h  i - bearing objects in the observed frequency range . even for the closest lars galaxy ( lars01 ; d=120@xmath112.4 mpc ) ,",
    "this 8  beam subtends a projected circular area that is nearly 280 kpc in diameter ; the potential for contamination in the gbt beam is significant .",
    "we thus examined sdss images of the area surrounding each lars galaxy for nearby objects .",
    "objects with spectroscopic data available from sdss that might have contributed to the gbt flux are noted below .",
    "these objects have velocities within 300 kms@xmath12  of the target lars galaxy and are within the 8  primary beamsize of the gbt .",
    "optical images of the fields that contain possible confusing sources ( lars06 and lars11 ) are shown in figures [ fig_lars06_field ] and [ fig_lars11_field ] ; these two sources are discussed in more detail in   [ s5 ] .",
    "we used the sdss g band to convert to luminosity l@xmath28 , which we compared with a log(m@xmath27/l@xmath29 ) value of @xmath80.5 for late type galaxies found in @xcite .",
    "the masses of potential contamination galaxies are computed from this ratio .",
    "we also use the 22.2 magnitude limit for the sdss to determine the possible contributions from optically dim sources of contamination . for our closest nine galaxies",
    "this is roughly 10@xmath30 m@xmath3  of h  i ; this increases to 10@xmath31 for our furthest two systems .",
    "this information is also presented in table  [ table_gbt_props ] .",
    "the profiles in figure  [ fig_gbt1 ] show a variety of h  i  structure .",
    "some galaxies are simple single peak profiles ( e.g , lars04 , lars09 ) , while others show complex and asymmetric profiles ( e.g. , lars01 , lars03 ) .",
    "still other systems have h  i  spectra that are almost certainly confused ; the classic double - horn profile of lars06 is likely due to the contribution of ugc10028 , a large spiral galaxy located only 1  to the southeast of lars06 ( see figure  [ fig_lars06_field ] ) .    various observed properties of each gbt h  i  profile , and the quantities derived from these , are tabulated in table  [ table_gbt_props ] : column 1 identifies the galaxy number ; column 2 is the systemic velocity in kms@xmath12 ; column 3 is the linewidth at 50% in kms@xmath12 ; column 4 is the linewidth at 20% in kms@xmath12 ; column 5 is the velocity offset between the optical velocity and the h  i  central velocity ; column 6 is the the single - dish integrated flux in jy kms@xmath12 ; column 7 is the mass from the single - dish measurements in units of 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 ; column 8 is the snr from the integrated flux and the peak ; column 9 is the rms noise value of the gbt in units of mjy ; column 10 gives the baseline polynomial fit used in the calibration of the gbt spectrum ; column 11 is the classification of the profile ( ` s ' for single - horned , ` d ' for double - horned , ` n ' for no detection , ` i ' for highly irregular shapes , or the presence of rfi near the signal region , and ` c ' for confusion due to known nearby galaxies . )",
    "the h  i  moment zero ( representing h  i  mass surface density ) and moment one ( representing intensity - weighted velocity ) images of the 5 lars galaxies observed in program 13a-181 are presented in figures  [ fig_vla_lars02 ] , [ fig_vla_lars03 ] , [ fig_vla_lars04 ] , [ fig_vla_lars08 ] , and [ fig_vla_lars09 ] . in panel",
    "( a ) of each figure , a digitized sky survey image is overlaid with contours of h  i  mass surface density ( individual contour levels are provided in the caption to each figure ) .",
    "the beam size is shown by a blue circle , while a red square shows the location of the hst pointing for which we have uv imaging ( see discussion in paper i and ii ) . in panel ( b ) of each figure , the h  i  moment one image ( representing intensity weighted velocity ) is presented in a rainbow color format ; the velocity scale of each galaxy is shown by a colorbar .",
    "based on the distances and optical angular sizes of the lars galaxies ( of order 1  or less ; see figures  [ fig_opta ] , [ fig_optb ] , and [ fig_optc ] ) , one would expect the h  i  to be distributed on similar angular scales . at the resolution of these data ( beam sizes between 59  and 72 )",
    ", the lars galaxies would thus appear as unresolved sources in the h  i  data cubes .",
    "as we discuss below , three of the lars galaxies have h  i  morphologies consistent with this interpretation .",
    "surprisingly , two of the sources have h  i  distributions that largely exceed the beam size ; we discuss these sources in detail below .",
    "it is important to stress that even in cases where galaxies are unresolved by an h  i  beam , one can still extract bulk characteristics of the neutral ism because of the spectrally resolved nature of the data .",
    "detailed kinematic analyses ( e.g. , rotation curve work or spatially resolved position - velocity diagrams ) will be unavailable in such cases .",
    "however , within the spatial and spectral resolution elements of the data , one can derive bulk constraints on the motions of the h  i  gas .",
    "we use the vla h  i  images of the 5 lars galaxies presented here to constrain two critical properties .",
    "first , the h  i  data allow us to localize the h  i  associated with the lars galaxy .",
    "this in turn allows us to accurately measure the total h  i  mass of each system .",
    "these interferometric measurements often recover less of the h  i  flux , and therefore mass , than the gbt measurements .",
    "we attribute this to the low snr of h  i  in these galaxies , the possible presence of low surface brightness h  i  features missed by the vla in extended regions or velocity space , and flux contamination from other galaxies , although we suspect that this is only relevant in the cases marked as confused .",
    "it is interesting to note that at the distances of the lars galaxies , interferometric observations are perhaps better suited to determine the h  i  mass than single - dish observations ( for example , the 60  characteristic resolution of the present data are about a factor of three better than the h  i  beam of arecibo , the largest single - dish radio telescope in the world , and a factor of eight better than our gbt resolution ) , simply because of the potential for contamination in the single - dish beam .",
    "second , the present data are sensitive to large - scale distributions of h  i  gas , some of which is expected to be tidal in origin based on the optical morphologies of the lars galaxies alone ( see , e.g. , figures  [ fig_opta ] , [ fig_optb ] , and [ fig_optc ] ) .    in table",
    "[ table_vla_props ] we present vla h  i  quantities for our five targeted galaxies derived in the same method as described above for the gbt data . column 1 identifies the galaxy number ; column 2 is the systemic velocity in kms@xmath12 ; column 3 is the linewidth at 50% in kms@xmath12 ; column 4 is the linewidth at 20% in kms@xmath12 ; column 5 is the velocity offset between the optical velocity and the h  i  central velocity ; column 6 is the the interferometric integrated flux in jy kms@xmath12 ; column 7 is the mass in units of 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 ; column 8 is the rms noise value in units of mjy / beam ; column 9 is the median global column density of h  i  from a column density map convolved with the beam size given in 10@xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "we now present discussion of each lars target based on our new h  i  data and on the hst imaging presented in @xcite , paper  i , and paper  ii .",
    "lars01 is a strong @xmath0  emitter , with a global ew of 46 (paper  i ) and a moderate star formation rate ( a few m@xmath3  yr@xmath12 ) .",
    "the single - dish h  i  observations ( see figure  [ fig_gbt1 ] ) reveal an asymmetric double - horn profile with peak snr of 6.5 and linewidth at 50% of 160 kms@xmath12 .",
    "we recover a total h  i  flux of 0.7 jy kms@xmath12  which at our distance of 118 mpc gives an h  i  mass of 2.3@xmath34 m@xmath3 .",
    "a search of the sdss field revealed no other objects within a @xmath11300 kms@xmath12  velocity range .    assuming that the h  i  profile is unconfused",
    ", the asymmetric line shape and offset from the optical velocity is suggestive of bulk outflow of h  i. consistent with this interpretation is the observation in paper ii that lars01 shows extended h@xmath7  and h@xmath24 emission .",
    "further , preliminary results from cos spectroscopy show that within the cos aperture ( 2.5  diameter ) , large column densities of neutral hydrogen are outflowing at around @xmath8128 kms@xmath12  with respect to the h@xmath7 velocity .",
    "note that lars01 will be studied in detail within paper  i , while rivera - thorsen etal .",
    "( in preparation ) will present the cos analysis of the whole sample .",
    "interstellar metal lines are blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy , and there is a distinct lack of static gas in the cos aperture .",
    "this is consistent with the recent results from @xcite , whose analysis of the interstellar oi , si ii and cii lines in this galaxy also yields an outflow of the neutral gas at @xmath8130 kms@xmath12  ( not including the geocoronal velocity offset applied by these authors ) .",
    "this large shift is also seen in our measurement of the systemic velocity of h  i  in lars01 .",
    "as the closest lars galaxy , future interferometric h  i  observations of lars01 will be especially interesting .",

    "while for disk dominated systems the h  i  linewidth and h  i  mass should be closely correlated , for the other types of systems the h  i  line profile may not only be indicative of rotation ; h  i  gas from multiple components may create irregular single - dish profiles .",
    "examples of this are clearly seen in the gbt spectra ( figure  [ fig_gbt1 ] ) and in the vla images ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig_vla_lars03 ] ) .",
    "third , we examine the offset in velocity between the centroid of the h  i  profile and the known systemic velocity of each lars galaxy as derived from optical spectroscopy . assuming that such offsets are caused by large - scale kinematic deviations from regularly rotating galaxy disks ( e.g.",
    ", tidal interaction , gas outflow or infall ) , this offset parameter can be considered a rough proxy for the presence or absence of large - scale motions of neutral gas . as discussed in @xcite and above for lars03",

    "the h  i  line width is positively correlated with the h@xmath57/h@xmath58 ratio ( see further discussion below ) .",
    "two factors are possibly at play here .",
    "either larger h  i  quantities scatter @xmath0  photons to extended radii , or interactions increase both the linewidth and preferentially block @xmath0  photons at short radii .",
    "two anti - correlations , and a positive correlation appear comparing the h  i  mass of our sample of well detected galaxies ( see figure  [ fig_compare_mass ] ) .",
    "the escape fraction ( @xmath54 = @xmath80.63 ) , and @xmath0  ew ( @xmath54 = @xmath80.60 ) show tentative evidence for anti - correlation , which do not appear when including the marginal detections .",
    "interestingly , the h@xmath57/h@xmath58 ratio shows strong evidence of correlation ( @xmath54 = 0.75 ) .",
    "it has been known for some time that more massive star forming galaxies ( hence those with larger h  i  masses and linewidths ) are dustier , and that the balmer decrement scales accordingly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "how this correlation may be connected to the underling @xmath0  propagation is not entirely clear .      we see no conclusive evidence of correlations with any of the global @xmath0  properties using either the whole sample or the positive detections .",
    "the strongest correlation is with the h@xmath7/h@xmath24 ratio ( @xmath54 = -0.53 ) .",
    "we find no significant correlation between the velocity offsets and the various @xmath0  properties .",
    "this might be due to our velocity smoothing and the large extent over which we are probing the velocity information .",
    "the strongest correlation is with with the h@xmath7/h@xmath24 ratio ( @xmath54 = 0.50 ) .",
    "we have presented new gbt spectroscopy and vla h  i  spectral line imaging of the galaxies in the `` lyman alpha reference sample '' ( `` lars '' ) .",
    "lars is a comprehensive , multi - wavelength study of 14 uv - selected star - forming galaxies that functions as a local benchmark for studies of @xmath0  emission and absorption at higher redshifts .",
    "the centerpiece is a suite of hst images that allows us to study @xmath0  emission and related quantities on a spatially resolved basis .",
    "the preliminary results presented in @xcite showed that most of the lars galaxies have large , diffuse halos of @xmath0  emission that exceed the sizes of the stellar populations ; this is strong evidence for the importance of resonant scattering in the neutral hydrogen gas component .",
    "the hi structure and content are important pieces for understanding the origin of the ly - alpha halos and their different sizes .",
    "our current hi angular resolution probes the large - scale global properties rather than those in the immediate vicinity of the ly - alpha halo regions imaged with hst .",
    "nevertheless , these provide important insights into the galaxy structure and environment .",
    "the lars survey products are described in paper i of this series @xcite ; the integrated properties of the lars galaxies as derived from the hst imaging are presented in paper ii of this series @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we present a first exploration of the h  i  properties of the lars galaxies . using data from the gbt 100 m telescope ,",
    "we have presented direct measurements of the neutral gas contents of 11 of the 14 galaxies ; we place limits on the three most distant ( z @xmath1 0.1 ) lars galaxies .",
    "these profiles show a wide variety of structure .",
    "some systems harbor multi - component profiles that are indicative of interaction or the presence of nearby companions ; others show more simple single h  i  peaks .",
    "two sources ( lars06 and lars11 ) are likely confused with nearby galaxies .",
    "we fit each of these profiles in order to derive global line properties , including systemic velocity , linewidths , h  i  flux integrals , and h  i  masses .    for a subset of five of the lars galaxies , we also present new , low - resolution h  i  spectral line imaging obtained with the vla .",
    "these h  i  images allow us to localize the h  i  associated with each galaxy .",
    "three of the systems ( lars02 , lars08 , and lars09 ) are unresolved at this angular resolution , while lars04 is resolved by a few beams .",
    "lars03 is highly resolved by the present data ; we have discovered an enormous tidal structure that contains more than 10@xmath2 m@xmath3  of h  i , and that extends more than 160 kpc from the main interacting galaxies in the lars03 system . based on the recovered flux integrals from these vla data , each of the five systems presented here would be amenable to higher spatial resolution observations .",
    "the vla c and b configurations would offer a factor of roughly 4 and 10 improvement in resolution respectively , but at the cost of longer integration times .",
    "in particular lars03 presents an interesting case where we have unequivocal evidence of kinematic disturbances on large scales , yet no accompanying boost relative to non - disturbed galaxies in @xmath0  escape fraction . a high resolution",
    "follow up with the vla and future radio telescopes , especially coupled with larger maps of the @xmath0  flux , would disentangle the local versus global kinematic effects , and probe the @xmath0  escape on physical scales larger than the @xmath1310 kpc already probed in the hst imaging .    using these new gbt and vla data , as well as the results derived from hst imaging and presented in paper ii , we compare various global h  i  and @xmath0  properties . while the sample is small , we find a few intriguing correlations in our robustly detected galaxies : the h  i  linewidths are strongly anti - correlated with @xmath56 ( @xmath54 = @xmath80.81 ) , while the total h  i  masses show anti - correlations with escape fraction and @xmath0  ew . additionally , both the h  i  linewidths and the h  i  masses are each correlated with the h@xmath57/h@xmath58 ratio . these intriguing but tentative ( anti-)correlations are in general agreement with a significant dependence of @xmath0  propagation on the total mass and thus the h  i  mass of the source , and is in general agreement with previous work by @xcite which found that the escape fraction decreases with increasing virial mass",
    ". these results also support the general trend that @xmath0  properties appear to correlate with total galaxy mass , as found in paper ii .",
    "that work showed that @xmath0  emission ( quantified by @xmath0  equivalent width , escape fraction , etc . )",
    "is systematically larger in lower mass galaxies . given the variety of properties that scale roughly with mass ( e.g. , metallicity , dust content , star formation rate , uv colors , etc . )",
    ", a larger statistical sample of galaxies will be needed in order to better quantify these trends .",
    "the famous metal - poor blue compact dwarf galaxy izw18 reminds us that the trend of lower mass galaxies having larger @xmath0  luminosities or escape fractions is not always true .",
    "while the system has an extremely low nebular oxygen abundance @xcite , an appreciable star formation rate @xcite , and a substantial uv luminosity @xcite , @xcite showed that izw18 is in fact a @xmath0  absorber .",
    "this process was explained by numerous scattering events in the neutral , and , most importantly , static ism even in the complete absence of dust @xcite .",
    "future local @xmath0  studies should seek to expand the number of low - mass systems with analyses similar to the ones presented here for lars .",
    "although it is tempting to view the increasing @xmath0/h@xmath7 with decreasing mass as a result of less gas mass being available for scattering , this theory must be cast in the light of results that suggest that gas fraction increases with increasing redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that lower mass galaxies tend to be more gas - rich @xcite and less dusty ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in figure  [ fig_fgas ] we see that the lars galaxies fit the general trend with gas mass fraction .    while @xmath0  halos seem to appear in systems with a range of h  i  linewidths",
    ", large @xmath0/h@xmath57 values only appear in galaxies with h  i  smaller linewidths .",
    "large @xmath0  halos are also correlated with less massive galaxies , and with increasing velocity offsets .",
    "we interpret this to mean that low h  i  linewidths are necessary but not sufficient for @xmath0  escape , while larger line widths contribute to the overall effects of @xmath0  destruction by dust , extinction , and scattering .",
    "the bulk of the evidence presented by previous @xmath0  work shows the importance of h  i  properties , especially kinematic details , in determining the escape of photons ( e.g. mas - hesse etal .",
    "this process is mostly governed by local effects , and it is unclear at this time what global h  i  properties are required for the escape and propagation of @xmath0  photons . the asymmetric gbt profiles and evidence of @xmath0  emission in the presence of large column densities of h  i  both point to interesting sub - resolution kinematic and density effects .    a larger sample of galaxies with data like those presented here will allow us to place these correlations on a more statistically robust footing . the hst elars program has been approved for 54 orbits and contains 28 more galaxies within our nominal sensitivity range of z @xmath13 0.08 .",
    "in addition , higher resolution follow up observations will allow us to determine kinematic details on more applicable scales for a number of our galaxies .",
    "this program will likely be the largest statistical sample of both h  i  and @xmath0  detected galaxies until new advances of radio telescopes , such as the square kilometer array , push h  i  detections to 20 - 100 kpc scales at z @xmath59 .",
