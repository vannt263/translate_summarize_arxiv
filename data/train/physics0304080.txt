    "most atmospheric and oceanic flows on intermediate scales of @xmath2 m are strongly influenced by the stable vertical density stratification , @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 anti - parallel to gravity ) , but are less influenced by earth s rotation than flows on larger scales .",
    "consequently , the turbulence in this regime is quite different from unstratified shear turbulence , convection , and geostrophic turbulence , all of which have been more extensively studied and whose behaviors are now relatively familiar .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the main effect of strongly stable stratification  small froude number , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a horizontal velocity scale , @xmath7 is the brnt vssla frequency , and @xmath8 is vertical length scale  is to organize the flow into two distinct , non - interacting classes : nearly linear internal gravity waves and fully nonlinear stratified turbulence .",
    "the flow patterns of stratified turbulence are often called pancake vortices @xcite or vortical modes @xcite because of their small aspect ratio , @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is a horizontal length scale ) , and significant vertical vorticity , neither of which is generally true for internal gravity waves .",
    "pancake vortices have an anisotropic velocity ( primarily horizontal ) and shear field ( primarily vertical ) , and they evolve principally under the nonlinear influence of horizontal advection as in two - dimensional turbulence .",
    "these motions cause little vertical turbulent heat or mass flux , and they have a highly anisotropic , inhomogeneous energy cascade to small scales and dissipation @xcite . at moderate values of reynolds number  @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath13 is a horizontal length scale  stratified turbulence evolves self - consistently , at least in freely decaying flows , in the sense that a bulk value for @xmath14 does not increase with time as energy dissipation causes @xmath0 to decrease @xcite . at leading order in @xmath14 ,",
    "the inviscid dynamical balances for stratified turbulence are equivalent to two - dimensional turbulence @xcite evolving independently at each vertical level .",
    "the energy dissipation may be modeled by adding a vertical eddy diffusion @xcite that acts to couple vertically adjacent levels and diffusively selects a limiting vertical length scale .",
    "however , with the assumption of uniform asymptotic validity as @xmath15 , stratified turbulence is constrained by hydrostatic and cyclostrophic force balances that also act to couple adjacent layers and may internally select a finite vertical scale as @xmath16 without inducing any vertically overturning motions @xcite .",
    "these behaviors have been studied both with laboratory experiments @xcite and with numerical simulations up to @xmath17 ; a review of this subject has recently been made by riley & lelong @xcite . in the ocean and atmosphere ,",
    "@xmath0 values are generally several orders of magnitude larger than those commonly reached in experiments or numerical simulations .",
    "thus , an important open question is whether the preceding wave - turbulence partition remains valid at very large @xmath0 .",
    "a central part of this question is whether the pancake vortices persist and remain `` stable '' with respect to overturning motions .",
    "the dynamical stability properties of a stably stratified shear flow are usually related to the richardson number , @xmath1 , locally defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the horizontal velocity and @xmath20 is the normalized `` temperature '' associated with density fluctuations @xmath21 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath1 is defined as a bulk measure in an analogous fashion with @xmath22 in the numerator and shear variance in the denominator ( a bulk @xmath23 ) . in the inviscid limit",
    ", a sufficient condition for stability of a parallel vertically sheared flow ( a kelvin - helmholtz flow ) is that the local @xmath1 exceed 0.25 throughout the flow @xcite .",
    "gage @xcite refined this criterion for several simple viscid shear flows and obtained values of the critical @xmath1 for linear instability between about 0.05 and 0.11 for large @xmath0 . in a numerical simulation at very high resolution ( with a maximum reynolds number based on the shear layer thickness @xmath24 ) and moderate stratification , werne & fritts @xcite show that the turbulence organizes itself so that @xmath1 never exceeds 0.25 . in the more complex natural environment , velocity variance and estimates of the vertical mixing efficiency increase rapidly as @xmath1 decreases through the range between about 0.5 and 0.0 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , majda & shefter @xcite stress the importance of temporal behavior on flow stability by constructing a family of time periodic solutions that are unstable at arbitrarily large @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we examine the behavior of stratified turbulence at large @xmath0 values by means of numerical simulations of the boussinesq equations with forcing at the larger scales of the computational domain .",
    "some simulations of forced stratified turbulence have been performed previously by herring and mtais @xcite , but the available resolution did not allow clear conclusions for flows at high @xmath0 .",
    "most experiments and simulations for stratified turbulence have been conducted on decaying turbulence , with many focused specifically on the transition from isotropic to stratified turbulence after an initial high - energy excitation event @xcite . because of the large energy dissipation rate in both isotropic and stratified turbulence , this evolutionary path starts with large @xmath0 and @xmath14 and only briefly resides in a fully developed regime _ en route _ to small @xmath0 and @xmath14 ; this situation therefore provides a limited view of the equilibrium geophysical regime .",
    "one of our main purposes here is to analyze the flow regimes of stratified turbulence in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath14 varied independently in a controlled fashion .",
    "a pseudo - spectral code is used to integrate the boussinesq equations on a triply periodic domain @xcite ; @xmath25 in these equations , @xmath26 is the three - dimensional velocity , @xmath27 is the pressure divided by @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the conductivity , and @xmath30 is the imposed forcing . in fourier space the equations for the fourier components of velocity and the temperature , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are @xmath33 @xmath34 is the projection operator onto the plane orthogonal to @xmath31 ; @xmath35 is the kronecker tensor , repeated indices indicate summation ; and @xmath36 when @xmath37 does not appear as an index .      as a simple means of separating turbulence ( _ v_ortices ) and",

    "the components @xmath46 were previously used by , riley  @xcite and lilly @xcite , and they are usually refered to `` vortical '' and `` wave '' components .",
    "the emergence of the `` shear '' component @xmath47 was emphasized by smith and waleffe  @xcite .",

    "in addition to this decomposition , we define the `` vertical kinetic energy '' @xmath61 as half the area - averaged square of the vertical velocity , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 as the vertical kinetic energy spectrum .",
    "our analysis is based on a single numerical solution ( designed after calculating many more exploratory solutions than we wish to admit ) .",
    "an anisotropic grid resolution is used to take advantage of the anisotropy of the flow that arises in response to the stable stratification ( a small aspect ratio ) .",

    "this increases the achievable @xmath0 value without loss of generality as long as the typical vertical scale is much smaller than the horizontal periodicity length .",
    "the level of stratification is controlled by adjusting the spatially uniform value of n in time .",

    "each of these large - scale transitions may be interpreted as an inverse energy cascade .",
    "however , they behavior is strongly constrained by the domain size in our simulations where the forcing is imposed at the gravest finite wavenumbers",

    "we choose to focus on simulations at very small froude number , and we are able to reach a reynolds number high enough to destabilize the pancake vortices in several ways .",

    "<S> there are successive transitions to ( a ) overturning motions with local reversals in the density stratification and small or negative values of @xmath1 ; ( b ) growth of a horizontally uniform vertical shear flow component ; and ( c ) growth of a large - scale vertical flow component . throughout these transitions , </S>",
    "<S> pancake vortices continue to dominate the large - scale part of the turbulence , and the gravity wave component remains weak except at small scales . </S>"
