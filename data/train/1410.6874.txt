    "a major determinant of the morphology of crystals grown from the melt far from local thermodynamic equilibrium is the solid - liquid interface kinetic coefficient @xcite . for",

    "both the magnitude and anisotropy of @xmath6 have been shown theoretically , within the framework of solvability theory @xcite , and computationally using both front - tracking @xcite and phase - field @xcite approaches , to have a crucial influence on dendritic solidification at large growth rates . to date , major progress has been achieved in using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with embedded - atom - method ( eam ) interatomic potentials to compute @xmath6 and its anisotropy for various pure metals ( e.g. ni , cu , mg , and fe ) and different crystal structures ( e.g. bcc , hcp , and fcc ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , results of those simulations , such as for pure ni @xcite , have been used as input parameters in phase field simulations @xcite , thereby making it possible to link quantitatively atomistic and continuum length scales for the prediction of dendrite growth rates that have been compared with experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , results from md simulations have made it possible to test quantitatively basic theories of crystal growth kinetics , thereby shedding light on the physical mechanisms that controls @xmath0 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath6 has been found to be well predicted by the expression @xmath11 proposed by broughton , gilmer , and jackson ( bgj ) to interpret crystallization rates measured by md simulations in the lennard - jones system @xcite .",
    "here @xmath12 is the thermal velocity of atoms in the liquid , assumed to limit the rate of atomic attachment at the interface , @xmath13 is the atomic mass and @xmath14 is a constant of order unity that can generally depend on the growth orientation ; @xmath15 is the latent heat per atom .",
    "bgj introduced eq .",
    "( [ bgj ] ) based on the finding that crystallization rates were too large to be explained by the common assumption that atomic attachment at the solid - liquid interface is a thermally activated process with the same energy barrier as liquid - state diffusion . coriell and turnbull @xcite independently developed an expression for @xmath6 in metallic systems based on a similar assumption that crystallization is limited by the rate of liquid - atom collisions at the interface , but related this rate to the frequency of atomic vibrations in the solid instead of to the thermal velocity of liquid - atoms , which yields the expression @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the speed of sound in the solid .",
    "this upper bound estimate of @xmath6 is much larger than values extracted from md simulations to date for pure metals @xcite , which are in closer agreement with eq .",
    "( [ bgj ] ) .",
    "( [ bgj ] ) has been put on a firmer theoretical footing by mikheev and chernov ( mc ) @xcite who derived a similar form in the theoretical framework of classical density functional theory of freezing @xcite . in this density wave picture ,",
    "crystal ordering of atoms increases from liquid to solid through several atomic layers parallel to the interface .",
    "concomitantly , the amplitude of density waves corresponding to different reciprocal lattice vectors ( rlv ) of the crystal lattice increases smoothly from zero in the liquid to constant values in the crystal along the @xmath18-axis normal to the interface .",
    "the expression for @xmath6 in the mc theory is derived by only considering the contribution of the set of principal rlv ( with lowest magnitude @xmath19 ) to the crystal density field , and by using a fluctuation - dissipation relation to relate the rate of interface dissipation to the inverse half - width of the dynamic equilibrium structure factor @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this theory predicts a magnitude of @xmath6 of the form of eq .",
    "( [ bgj ] ) where @xmath14 depends on growth orientation through the orientation dependence of the spatial decay rate of density waves into the liquid , which depends on @xmath21 .",
    "it should also be noted that , according to the mc theory , the kinetic coefficient depends on a relaxation time of density waves in the liquid , which in turn can be related to the liquid diffusion coefficient .",
    "therefore , the mc model appears to disagree with the main assumption first proposed by bgj .",
    "in a recent md study , mendelev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that , at least in the limit of small undercoolings , @xmath6 is in fact proportional to the diffusivity .",
    "the authors speculate that there is a change in atomic attachment mechanism in the high and low undercooling limits .",
    "in this paper , we derive an expression for @xmath6 within the framework of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory . like the mc theory ,",
    "gl theory is rooted in a density wave picture of the solid - liquid interface structure and considers a minimal set of rlv to represent the crystal density field .",
    "however a non - trivial difference between the two theories is that the mc theory is linearized around the liquid state and hence neglects the nonlinear interaction between different density waves .",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath6 arises solely in this theory from the orientation dependence of the exponential decay rate into the liquid of non - interacting density waves .",
    "in contrast , gl theory captures the nonlinear interaction between different density waves through the inclusion of cubic and quartic terms in the gl expansion of the free - energy density in density wave amplitudes .",
    "consequently , the resulting expression for @xmath6 derived here in the gl framework depends explicitly on the interacting nonlinear density wave profiles through the entire solid - liquid interface region and , as a result , @xmath6 has a different anisotropy than that predicted by the linearized mc theory @xcite .",
    "we carry out our analysis for the bcc - liquid interface whose equilibrium properties , in particular the excess free - energy of the interface @xmath22 and its anisotropy , have been modeled previously by gl theory @xcite .",
    "this equilibrium theory is extended to a non - equilibrium situation in the standard framework of the time - dependent gl ( tdgl ) theory .",
    "we incorporate a thermodynamic driving force proportional to the undercooling and a free - energy dissipation time scale that is related , as in the mc theory , to the inverse half - width of the dynamic equilibrium structure factor .",
    "the kinetic coefficient @xmath6 is calculated explicitly for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 interfaces using parameters obtained from md simulations for the fe eam potential developed by mendelev _",
    "_ @xcite and the results are compared to the predictions of md simulations using this potential @xcite and the mc theory .",
    "we note that the general methodology developed here to derive an expression for the kinetic coefficient within a tdgl framework applies directly to amplitude equations for elemental systems @xcite and binary alloys @xcite derived from the phase - field - crystal ( pfc ) model @xcite .",
    "as shown previously by wu and karma @xcite in a study of the equilibrium bcc - liquid interface , the set of amplitude equations derived from the pfc model only differs from the set derived from gl theory in the coefficients of nonlinear terms that couple different density waves . in the amplitude equations derived from the pfc model , all coefficient of nonlinear terms",
    "are uniquely determined by the nonlinear form assumed for the free - energy density in the pfc model from which the amplitude equations are derived .",
    "in contrast , in the versions of gl theory of refs .",
    "@xcite , those coefficients are determined by the ansatz that all _ geometrically distinct _ closed polygons with the same number of sides corresponding to rlv have equal weight . in principle , the weight of closed polygons in reciprocal space can be derived if higher order @xmath23-point correlation functions are provided . however , this information is difficult to obtain .",
    "if one assumes that higher order correlation functions are constant , then one recovers the nonlinear coefficients in the amplitude equations derived from the pfc model @xcite .",
    "differences in coefficients obtained from an amplitude expansion of the standard pfc model and this ansatz were found to have only a small effect on the prediction of @xmath22 and its anisotropy for the bcc - liquid interface @xcite .",
    "however , more generally , the formalism developed in the present work should prove useful in the development of pfc formulations and amplitude equations that model different kinetic anisotropies for different crystal structures .",
    "we first write down the tdgl model of crystallization and then use this model to derive an analytical expression for the kinetic coefficient .",
    "we detail the procedure for a specific choice of orientation and state the results for other orientations .",
    "next , we present a method to compute the relaxation time of density waves in the liquid that is a key kinetic input parameter for both the mc and gl theories .",
    "we then compare the predictions of gl theory to the predictions of the linearized mc theory and previous md simulation studies .",
    "to construct a tdgl model of crystallization kinetics for the bcc - liquid system , we start from the expression for the excess free - energy @xmath24 for the solid - liquid system in equilibrium relative to the liquid free energy . under the assumption that the density wave amplitude varies slowly on the scale of the lattice spacing ,",
    "this excess has the form @xcite : @xmath25 the @xmath26 s denote the amplitudes of density waves corresponding to the rlv with the smallest magnitude @xmath19 in the truncated expansion of the number density @xmath27 and have the limits @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) in the solid ( liquid ) .",
    "since the reciprocal lattice of bcc is fcc , there are twelve @xmath19 s of equal magnitude pointing in @xmath30 directions .",
    "@xmath31 denotes the liquid structure factor and @xmath32 refers to the fourier transform of the direct correlation function @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the coefficients of the gradient square terms are determined by comparison of the form and the expression for the free - energy of an inhomogeneous liquid , yielding @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 are determined in the same way as in shih _",
    "_ @xcite and wu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite from the the two equilibrium conditions that the solid and liquid phases must have equal free energies at the melting point and the equilibrium state of the solid is a minimum of free - energy .",
    "these two conditions yield the values @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 . in addition , the aforementioned ansatz that all closed polygons of @xmath2 s with the same number of sides have equal weight yields the constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to note that in the absence of knowledge of higher order correlation functions there is no general way to determine the weight for each closed polygon .",
    "thus we simply assume that geometrically distinct polygons ( i.e. , exclude repetitive polygons ) have equal weight . however , if one assumes that fourier transforms of higher order correlation functions are constant , then all polygons ( including repetitive polygons ) contribute equally in the free energy and this yields @xmath44 and @xmath45 as shown in the pfc calculations @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to examine the relation between these normalization constants .",
    "for example , there are 27 geometrically distinct 4-side polygons . out of these 27 polygons ,",
    "6 of them contain twice the same rlvs ( e.g. , @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 $ ] ) , and 21 of them contain 4 different rlvs ( e.g. , @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath47 $ ] ) .",
    "thus if we choose to count all repetitive polygons , the number of 4-side polygons is @xmath50 ( since there are @xmath51 ways to rearrange rlvs for the 6 polygons that contain twice the same rlvs and @xmath52 ways for each of the 21 polygons that contain four different rlvs ) .    to incorporate a driving force for crystallization in the model",
    ", we expand the free energy difference between the solid and liquid phases near the melting point in the form @xmath53 where we have used the thermodynamic relation @xmath54 and @xmath15 denotes the latent heat of melting per atom .",
    "furthermore , we add this driving force by assuming that this free - energy difference varies proportionally to the density wave amplitude through the solid - liquid interface region .",
    "this yields the expression for the free - energy of the two - phase system outside of equilibrium @xmath55 the normalization constant @xmath56 in the driving force term ensures that for bcc lattices the bulk energy difference between solid and liquid has the correct temperature dependence imposed by eq . .",
    "next , we assume that the evolution of the order parameters @xmath26 is governed by an equation of the standard tdgl form @xmath57 where the kinetic time scale @xmath58 is fixed by the requirement that density waves in the liquid should relax on a time scale @xmath59 corresponding to the inverse half - width of the dynamical structure factor @xmath20 .",
    "this requirement is satisfied by the choice @xmath60 with the above choice , the tdgl equation ( [ eom0 ] ) reduces in the liquid to @xmath61 due to the cancellation of the factor of @xmath62 on both sides of the equation .",
    "to derive an expression for the kinetic coefficient , we look for a steady - state propagating solution of the tdgl equation that corresponds to planar crystallization fronts moving at constant velocity @xmath8 .",
    "those solutions have the general form @xmath63 where @xmath1 is the crystal growth direction normal to the solid - liquid interface . to analyze those solutions , we transform eq .",
    "to a moving frame translating at velocity @xmath8 along the normal direction through the coordinate transformation @xmath64 , which yields the set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations @xmath65 for the time - independent profiles @xmath66 . for a given direction of the interface @xmath67 , an analytic expression for @xmath6 can be obtained by looking for solutions of eq . in the limit of small driving force where @xmath68 and the propagating density wave profiles deviate only slightly from the stationary equilibrium profiles for @xmath69 . in this limit , the problem of finding solutions to eq .",
    "can be transformed into a linear problem by linearizing eq . around the equilibrium profiles , i.e. by substituting @xmath70 where @xmath71 denote the stationary equilibrium profiles and @xmath72 denote small linear perturbations of those equilibrium profiles due to interface motion . an expression for @xmath6",
    "is then readily obtained from the solvability condition of finding the solutions @xmath72 to a set of coupled linear differential equations with some non - constant coefficients that depend on the @xmath71 profiles .",
    "this procedure is a straightforward generalization of the standard procedure used to derive an expression for the interface kinetic coefficient in the standard single order parameter phase - field model of crystal growth ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . we carry out this calculation explicitly below for the three low index crystal faces generally considered in characterizing the anisotropy of interface properties in fcc- and bcc - forming systems .",
    "to start , we use the results of previous work on capillary anisotropy for bcc - liquid interfaces @xcite .",
    "this analysis shows that the amplitudes of density waves can be categorized into different groups according to the relative orientations of different principal rlv .",
    "those orientations determine the values of @xmath21 and hence the coefficients of the square gradient terms appearing in the gl free - energy functional as summarized in table [ cis ] for the three crystal faces considered . to exemplify our calculation in detail",
    ", we choose the @xmath4 crystal face for which the amplitude of propagating density waves are denoted as @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 with corresponding values of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , respectively .",

    "the comparison of the first and fourth columns indicates that a main contributing factor to this improvement is the fact that gl theory uses nonlinear density wave profiles with widths that better match the md - calculated equilibrium profiles than the width predicted by eqs . and",

    "underestimation for the magnitude of @xmath6 by the mc theory is shown in previous studies for fe , pb , ni , and lennard - jones systems @xcite . in contrast , the magnitude of @xmath6 computed by gl theory is comparable with those found in md simulations , since the dimensionless anisotropy factor @xmath160 computed by gl theory is obtained through the integration of spatial derivative of full nonlinear density waves profiles , see table [ ckn ] .    furthermore , the gl theory yields an analytical relation between two important interfacial quantities , namely the interfacial energy and the kinetic coefficients , as discussed below . under the isotropic approximation ,",
    "the interfacial energy derived from gl theory for bcc - liquid interfaces at equilibrium is proportional to the solid amplitude square @xcite , @xmath187 the corresponding isotropic density wave profile is @xmath188 which gives rise to @xmath189 and the dimensionless anisotropy factor @xmath190 thus the magnitude of @xmath6 is proportional to the inverse of @xmath191 . since both interfacial energy and kinetic coefficient",
    "are related to the solid amplitude square , we can relate these two quantities using eq .",

    "the remaining discrepancy between md simulations and gl theory is likely due to the over - simplified representation of the crystal density field in terms of the minimal set of principal rlv , which ignores contributions of higher order reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "interestingly , this representation yields a prediction of the anisotropy of @xmath6 in the gl theory that is independent of details of the interatomic potentials , which only enter in the theory through the amplitude of density waves in the solid @xmath88 and liquid structure factor properties .",
    "while those properties influence the magnitude of @xmath6 , they do not influence its anisotropy because the shape of the density wave profiles are independent of @xmath88 and liquid structure factor properties up to a common multiplicative factor of the amplitude for all profiles and up to a common scaling factor of length for all widths , respectively .",
    "for the same reason , the anisotropy of the solid - liquid interfacial free - energy predicted by gl theory was found previously to be independent of details of interatomic potentials @xcite . for a realistic crystal density field represented by a large set of rlv",
    ", the anisotropy of @xmath6 is expected to generally depend on the interatomic potential as found in several md studies for different crystal structures @xcite . thus extending gl theory to include more reciprocal lattice vectors",
    "could potentially give rise to a better prediction of kinetic anisotropy .",
    "in addition to the anisotropy , another interesting and unexplained aspect of mc theory is the magnitude of @xmath6 . in a previous md study , monk _",
    "@xcite proposed several techniques to correctly account for the temperature rise associated with latent release during free solidification md simulations .",
    "the techniques were applied to an eam model of fcc ni and the authors found that the value of @xmath6 was approximately a factor of two larger than the @xmath6 computed without the temperature spike correction . if we make the crude assumption that a similar factor of two can be applied to all previous md studies ( see the summary provided in hoyt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , then it appears the mc model underestimates the kinetic coefficient in fcc crystals by a factor of roughly 3 - 4 .",
    "in this comparison various properties of the liquid , such as the structure function and the relaxation time , were estimated from the hard sphere system . in the case of md simulations of bcc fe ,",

    "_ @xcite have accounted for the effect of latent heat release and , as summarized in table [ mag_mu ] , the value of @xmath6 is an order of magnitude higher than the mc prediction . here",
    "again the kinetic coefficient is found to be about a factor of two higher than previous md estimates for fe @xcite .",
    "therefore it is safe to conclude that the mc model consistently underestimates the magnitude of the kinetic coefficient , the deviation is a factor of @xmath205 3 - 4 for fcc and @xmath205 10 for bcc",
    ". it should be noted , however , that a preliminary md study of the bcc elements @xcite , i.e. without an interface temperature correction , concluded that there is closer agreement with mc theory for the case of mo and v than had been observed for fe , which suggests that details of the interatomic potential not included in the mc treatment may be playing a role in bcc systems .    to further elucidate the trend of kinetic coefficient with crystal structure and interatomic potential , a comparison of the gl model developed here to detailed md simulations of other bcc , as well as fcc ,",
    "systems is warranted .",
    "this comparison will require to extend the present calculation to other crystal structures .",
    "this should be possible by building on recent progress to reproduce quantitatively the anisotropy of the fcc - liquid interface with two different sets of density waves @xcite .",
    "such a comparison will also make it possible to explore more systematically the inverse relationship between the kinetic coefficient and the interfacial free - energy predicted by gl theory in this study .",
