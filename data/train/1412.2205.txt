    "`` stabilization '' is the term used for the counterintuitive behavior of atoms in which increasing the laser intensity does not lead to increased ionization  on the contrary , it may lead to decreased ionization in some regimes .",
    "stabilization has been the subject of so many publications that even a cursory review is beyond the scope of our manuscript ( for some early references , see refs .",
    "@xcite , or ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the purpose of our manuscript is to provide new insights into the stabilization phenomenon , gained by viewing it through the unconventional point of view of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "this is not to say that the use of classical mechanics to examine stabilization is a novelty : a number of stimulating studies were performed during the time frame mentioned above ( e.g. , ref .",
    "however , the intervening two decades have seen the realization of lasers with intensities far beyond what was expected at the time , and quite a few phenomena such as recollisions  @xcite have been discovered , requiring the inception of various theoretical models and techniques for understanding ionization ( or the lack of it ) in intense laser fields .    in the intervening decades",
    "laser pulses have become ultrashort ( down to about 100 attoseconds ) .",
    "the general idea is to go down to the timescale of the electron to capture its dynamics .",
    "such ultrashort timescales were not part of stabilization research at the time , which typically considered fairly long pulses of several tens of laser cycles",
    ". can any insights about such a long - pulse phenomenon be relevant for understanding the motion of the electron on its timescale ?",
    "as we will show below , no matter how long the pulse is , the fate of the electron , and hence stabilization , is sealed quite early in the pulse , and specifically during a few first few laser cycles . in that sense",
    ", stabilization turns out to be a short - timescale phenomenon .    in what follows we will be answering two questions : first , what accounts for the lack of ionization in ultra - intense laser fields , and secondly , what causes ionization to decrease with increasing intensity ?",
    "it turns out that the answers to these questions , and the hidden short - time nature of the phenomenon , are governed by the same underlying mechanism , namely the periodic orbits of the atomic electron in the laser field and the phase - space structures associated with these periodic orbits .",
    "we will show that electron trajectories which can reach the vicinity of the periodic orbit behave completely differently from those trajectories that fail to do so , thereby accounting for the observations connected with stabilization .",
    "in the process of answering these questions we will also address some highly practical aspects of stabilization , namely  :    \\1 ) how does one decide whether an atomic electron has ionized in an intense laser field ?",
    "more specifically , are the so - called distance and energy criteria for ionization interchangeable ?",
    "\\2 ) what role do the ramp - up , plateau and ramp - down of the laser field play in stabilization ?    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ip ] we start by performing the numerical experiment of ref .  @xcite and assess the importance of the choice of the ionization criterion . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nlanalysis ] we provide an explanation for the lack of complete ionization at high intensity and for the decrease of the ionization probability as the laser intensity is increased .",
    "this explanation is based on a periodic orbit analysis of the electronic dynamics .",
    "we investigate the role of each part of the laser pulse , namely the ramp - up , the plateau and the ramp - down , in the stabilization process .",
    "we consider the following classical model for a one - dimensional single active electron atom interacting with an intense linearly polarized laser field in the dipole approximation  : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the momentum of the electron canonically conjugate to the position @xmath2 along the polarization axis , @xmath3 is the amplitude of the electric field , @xmath4 is the pulse envelope ( schematically represented on fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] ) and @xmath5 is the frequency . we have chosen a soft coulomb potential  @xcite as the interaction potential between the electron and its parent ion . in ref .",

    "we consider a large ensemble of trajectories which are initially bounded , i.e. , whose energy , defined as the sum of the kinetic energy plus the soft coulomb potential , is negative .",

    "contrary to ref .",
    "@xcite we observe a roughly monotonic increase of the ionization probability with @xmath3 as it could be naively guessed ( the more intense the laser field is , the more ionization there is ) .",
    "now , instead of using the energy criterion as ionization criterion , we use a distance criterion .",
    "this distance criterion appears to be more subjective since it depends on an arbitrarily chosen threshold . here",
    "the chosen threshold is 50 a.u . ; we have checked that the results are not changed qualitatively by changing this threshold significantly .",
    "the resulting ionization curve is depicted in fig .",

    "fig : ioniz ] ) . here",
    "we first notice the importance of the ionization criterion to observe the ionization stabilization phenomenon .",
    "we performed a third numerical experiment by including a ramp - down with @xmath13 and by using the energy criterion .",
    "contrary to the case with an abrupt ramp - down ( @xmath11 ) , the energy criterion leads to stabilization ( see fig .  [",

    "what follows , we only use the distance criterion unless specified otherwise .",
    "below we provide an explanation for the differences resulting from the two choices of ionization criterion .",
    "this is a direct result of the mechanism by which an electron remains trapped near the parent ion at a very high intensity , a mechanism we unravel using nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we first elucidate the role of the plateau by providing the scenario for the lack of complete ionization at high intensity . since the amplitude of the electric field is large , we consider first the strong field approximation ( sfa ) which consists of neglecting the soft coulomb interaction between the electron and the parent ion . in sfa ,",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) during the plateau becomes @xmath16 where we have included a laser phase to take into account the ramp - up , i.e. , we consider that the plateau starts at @xmath17 .",
    "this hamiltonian is integrable and the trajectories can be explicitly provided  : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the initial position and initial momentum ( at @xmath17 , i.e. , at the beginning of the plateau ) .",
    "we notice a linear drift with velocity @xmath21 .",
    "if this drift velocity is non - zero , the electron will eventually move far away from the parent ion , provided that the plateau is sufficiently long .",
    "we notice a very special set of initial conditions for which the drift velocity vanishes .",
    "this set in phase space is composed of an infinite family of ( parabolic ) periodic orbits with the same period as the laser field , related to each other by translation along the @xmath2-axis due to the continuous symmetry of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham0 ] ) . more specifically , these periodic orbits have the equations    [ eq : posfa ] @xmath22    where @xmath23 is an arbitrary position , the position of the center of the periodic orbit . if the electron is on one of these orbits at the beginning of the plateau , it will stay on it for an infinite amount of time .",
    "these invariant structures are the keystone to understand the lack of complete ionization at high intensity .    even though this set of periodic orbits is of measure zero and therefore it could be argued that it does not contribute significantly to the ionization probability , the nonlinearity introduced by the soft coulomb interaction provides the reasons for the importance of this set of periodic orbits in the stabilization process , as we show next .",
    "the question is what happens to the rather simple sfa picture of the dynamics when the coulomb field is taken into account ? as the effect of the soft coulomb potential increases , e.g. , by increasing an effective charge up to 1 , most of the periodic orbits  ( [ eq : posfa ] ) are broken , except a finite number of them .",
    "three periodic orbits are of particular interest and organize the dynamics .",
    "all three periodic orbits have the same period , the period of the laser field .",
    "one of them is symmetric with respect to the @xmath24 axis , centered at @xmath25 and weakly hyperbolic .",

    "the property of a periodic orbit to be hyperbolic , parabolic or elliptic features refers to the linear stability analysis ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail ) . in general , an elliptic periodic orbit is stable and the motion around it is similar to the motion around a stable equilibrium point of a simple pendulum , whereas an hyperbolic orbit is ( linearly ) unstable , in the sense that almost all small perturbation around it will drive the motion away from it ( along its unstable manifold ) . the chaotic behavior of the system originates in the neighborhood of hyperbolic periodic orbits .",
