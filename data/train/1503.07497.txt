    "the advent of the chandra and xmm - newton x - ray astronomy missions has revitalized the field of cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "chandra s combination of arcsecond resolution imaging and the moderate energy spectral resolution afforded by ccd x - ray detectors has proven well suited to the study of supernova remnants , and specifically the x - ray synchrotron radiation emitted by cosmic ray electrons .",
    "this often reveals itself as thin rims of continuum emission in the 4 - 6 kev waveband ( a region essentially free of quasi - thermal line emission from shocked plasma ) spatially coinciding with the supernova remnant forward shock .",
    "this can be understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as cosmic ray electrons radiating in the strong ( i.e. amplified ) magnetic field at the shock .",
    "the radial extent is limited by either the radiative loss time of the electrons , or the decay of magnetic field postshock .",
    "the remnant of tycho s supernova shows an even more intriguing pattern of synchrotron radiation ; a series of `` stripes '' or ripples , @xcite , observed most clearly in the 4 - 6 kev waveband where line emission from the quasi - thermal plasma in the snr is absent .",
    "the wavelength corresponds to the gyroradius of cosmic ray protons with energies in the range @xmath1 ev , but the precise mechanism by which these structures form is not known .    the bell instability @xcite , which amplifies magnetic field in the shock precursor region , generates linearly polarized structures in a near perpendicular shock geometry . considering the effect of these short wavelength fluctuations on the cosmic ray current ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that long wavelength upstream structures can result , with spatial variations of the magnetic field strength and hence synchrotron emissivity .",
    "@xcite argue that these long wavelength structures are responsible for the `` stripes '' .",

    "most importantly , the shock region where the stripes appear must be `` _ nearly perpendicular _ ''",
    "* do nt specify how close to 90@xmath2 they require ) , and that in this nearly perpendicular region , shock acceleration must still be efficient .",
    "but as discussed elsewhere @xcite , the efficiency of shock acceleration at quasi - perpendicular shocks is open to question .",
    "@xcite offer an alternative idea , that is appears most promising at parallel shocks .",
    "they find fully nonlinear exact ideal mhd solutions supported by the cosmic ray return current , which comprise pulses of alfvn waves that can propagate ahead of the main shock .",
    "@xcite argue that these alfvn pulses when visible in x - rays should appear as quasi - periodic stripes , with spacing similar to that of the observed stripes . in their equations , @xcite neglect thermal and cosmic ray pressure gradients , assuming that the ponderomotive force of the turbulence is much stronger . in the opposite limit",
    "high frequency sound waves are generated by the drury instability @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the forward shock may push forwards in upstream cavities created at the saturation of the bell instability , also at parallel shocks .",
    "@xcite discuss a similar idea in connection with shock structures ( although not stripes ) seen in sn 1006 .    in this paper",
    "we pursue a different model for these synchrotron stripes in tycho s snr .",
    "cosmic rays drifting ahead of a quasi - parallel shock generate upstream circularly polarized alfvn waves .",
    "we assume these to be parallel propagating ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with no spatial variation in magnetic field pressure . upon passage through the shock , both the magnetic field and the wave propagation change direction , and by different amounts , so that the formerly parallel propagating waves are now obliquely propagating .",
    "the circular polarization decomposes into its linearly polarized constituents .",
    "the magnetosonic polarization becomes compressive , and quickly decays by transit time damping .",
    "the alfvn polarization survives longer , and its spatially varying magnetic field gives rise the regions of enhanced synchrotron emission , observable as the stripes or ripples seen by @xcite .",
    "the following sections treat the wave refraction at the shock , the wave transmission and reflection coefficients , and the postshock damping of the magnetosonic and alfve modes .",

    "away from this limit , @xmath45 will be different for magnetosonic and alfvn modes . in supernova remnants , this is unlikely to be a significant effect , but in the lower @xmath46 shocks driven by solar coronal mass ejections , this could be an important consideration .",
    "the limit @xmath24 also captures the case when @xmath47 , appropriate for the bell nonresonant instability where modes grow at zero frequency .",

    ", results for @xmath56 and @xmath57 are obtained from equation 15 with the replacement @xmath58 .",
    "the magnetosonic mode is much more involved since perturbed magnetic field and velocity vectors lie in the plane of refraction .",
    "it appears to be tractable only in the limit @xmath42 , when the motion of the shock front itself in response to the passing wave can be neglected .",
    "we evaluate the jump conditions for the tangential electric field and the continuity of transverse momentum using @xmath59    substituting into the first jump condition gives @xmath60 multiplying out and assuming @xmath61 yields @xmath62 we put @xmath63 or @xmath64 to represent an initially forward or backward propagating wave , and then put @xmath65 and rearrange to find @xmath66 the + ve sign in the left hand side corresponds to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , while the -ve sign corresponds to @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "the strong turbulence expression for @xmath81 is probably the most applicable .",
    "these simplest expressions refer to balanced turbulence , with equal wave amplitudes propagating in each direction . in our case , and decay rate of the transmitted waves",
    "will depend on the intensity of counter propagating reflected waves , and vice versa .",
    "we will assume cosmic rays streaming ahead of the shock generate wave travelling in one direction only ( away from the shock ) , and then we will take @xmath82 , where @xmath57 is the reflection coefficient calculated above in equation 24 , in the damping rates .    , as indicated . when projected onto the shock front the distance between magnetic field maxima",

    "we argue that these structures arise at oblique shocks , where upstream parallel circularly polarized waves which are undamped become obliquely propagating damped waves postshock .",
    "the key point is that the magnetosonic polarization damps faster than the alfvn polarization , and so a spatial variation in the magnetic field strength will emerge associated with the surviving alfvn mode . along the direction of propagation the absolute magnitude of the magnetic field strength",

    "this is significantly lower than the likely upstream magnetic field contrast of between a factor of 9 and 15 , but probably reasonable when we consider that both polarizations are amplified upstream by this amount , and then the magnetosonic polarization is preferentially damped by transit time damping . in the case that the electron cooling time becomes longer than the alfvn mode damping time , the variation of magnetic field along the shock front will be less clear , but stripes separated by @xmath149 oriented normal to @xmath150 extending further inside the shock would result , analogous to ripples associated with sound waves .",
    "we suggest a model for the synchrotron `` stripes '' or ripples observed in tycho s snr @xcite based only on simple ideas about alfvn propagation and dissipation at the forward shock , calculated as a function of its obliquity .",
    "we find that the contrast is highest , and therefore that the stripes would be most visible for a narrow range of shock obliquities close to 15@xmath2 in the case of strong iroshnikov - kraichnan turbulence . in our model , the emission comes from behind the shock front , once the magnetosonic component of the originally circularly polarized wave has been transit time damped .",
