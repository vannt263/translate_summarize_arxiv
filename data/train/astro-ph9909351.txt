    "the existence of non - axysimmetric components of the galactic potential has been frequently invoked as an efficient way to transport gas from the galaxy scale down to the nucleus to fuel the agn . in particular",
    ", the shocks and gravitational torques induced by a galactic bar primary bar ; when considering secondary bars , it will be clearly stated ] can make the gas loose angular momentum and therefore facilitate the fuelling mechanism ( shlosman et al .",
    "nevertheless , it has been suggested that there is not a preference for seyfert nuclei to occur in barred galaxies ( heckman 1980 ; simkim et al .",
    "this result is confirmed by statistical analyses on the catalogued morphology of seyfert galaxies ( moles et al .",
    "1995 ) and through near - infrared imaging studies ( mcleod & rieke 1995 ; alonso - herrero et al . 1996",
    "; mulchaey & regan 1997 ) .",
    "we have started a large observational program aimed at studying the conditions for the onset of activity in galactic nuclei . based on previous work ( moles et al .",
    "1995 ) , we search for detailed morphological and kinematical differences between active and non active galaxies of similar global morphology .",
    "we particularly pay attention to those that could facilitate the transport of gas towards the very central regions and the nucleus ( for an example of the complete analysis of one of our sample galaxies see prez et al .",
    "for this purpose , we are obtaining optical and near - infrared images and long slit spectroscopy with the best possible spatial resolution .",
    "we selected a sample of galaxies , out of which 18 host active nuclei and the rest form a control sample of non active galaxies ( see sect . [ sample ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the first data set : the infrared imaging data in the j and k bands .",
    "infrared imaging is particularly important because it allows to trace the old stellar population , and to separate the various components ( the bulge , disk , bar(s ) and spiral arms ) with the smallest contribution of the active nucleus and less contamination by dust absorption .",
    "in fact , various k band imaging studies have revealed that bars were present in galaxies classified as unbarred in the optical ( mcleod & rieke 1995 ; mulchaey & regan 1997 ) , hence showing that the near - infrared is better suited for these purposes .",
    "the sample is described in section 2 . in section [ data ]",
    "we present the near - infrared data we have obtained together with the hst archive images we used . in section [ methods ]",
    "we describe the different methods of analysis applied to the images . in sections [ actives ] and [",
    "non - active ] the results are described for each of the galaxies in both sets of active and non - active spirals respectively .",
    "the summary is given in section  2 .",
    "a discussion on the nir properties of these galaxies , together with the comparison of active versus non - active galaxies derived from these data will be presented in a companion paper ( mrquez et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the active galaxies have been chosen with the following criteria : ( a )  seyfert 1 or 2 from the vron - cetty & vron ( 1993 ) catalogue ; ( b )  with morphological information in the rc3 catalogue ; ( c )  isolated , in the sense of not having a companion within 0.4 mpc ( h@xmath1=75 km / s / mpc ) and cz@xmath2500 km / s , or companions catalogued by nilson without known z ; ( d )  nearby , cz@xmath26000 km / s ; and ( e )  intermediate inclination ( 30 to 65@xmath3 ) .",
    "the control sample galaxies have been selected among spirals verifying the same conditions ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) , and with types similar to those of the active spirals .",
    "thus , all the galaxies in our sample are isolated , in the sense of avoiding possible effects of interactions with luminous nearby galaxies .",
    "the main properties of the sample galaxies , as given in the rc3 catalogue are presented in table [ sample ] .",
    "the samples are not large enough to allow statistically significant results , but the detailed study of each of the galaxies in these samples should give us at least hints on what differences between active and non - active isolated spiral galaxies , if any , are to be taken into account to identify the conditions for the onset of nuclear activity .",
    "the active sample extends farther in redshift .",
    "in particular , there are six active galaxies with cz@xmath4 4000 km / s , but none in the control sample .",
    "although this changes the physical resolution achieved for those objects , we do nt expect any bias due to that difference .",
    "absolute mean b luminosities give m@xmath5 for seyferts and m@xmath6 for non - active galaxies . some contribution from the active galaxies",
    "would be expected as a consequence of the presence of the active nucleus itself and of the higher levels of star formation sometimes observed in that kind of galaxies ( maiolino & rieke 1995 ) . if any , this effect is not systematically present in our small samples , which can therefore be considered as comparable with respect to the host galaxy luminosity .",
    "the distribution of inclinations is almost flat for the non - active galaxies , whereas there is a deficiency of active galaxies at large inclinations , as expected for an optically selected sample of active galaxies ( mcleod & rieke 1995 ) .",
    "the morphological types of spiral active galaxies are earlier than sbc , resembling the type distribution of active galaxies in the vron - cetty & vron catalogue ( moles et al .",
    "1995 ) ; non - active galaxies have been selected to have similar types .",
    "looking at the presence of bars in the galaxies of both samples ( as catalogued in the rc3 ) , we notice that only one galaxy in the list of non - active objects is unbarred , and three more are of intermediate type x. for the active galaxies , half are barred and four more of type x. as already quoted , the presence of a primary bar does not seem to be the direct cause for the nuclear activity .",
    "otherwise the lists of active and non active galaxies we have observed are rather similar in global properties .",
    "we therefore estimate that the sample of non - active galaxies is well suited to be used as a control sample .",
    "we have obtained k images for the 18 active galaxies together with j images for 15 of them . j and k images",
    "were taken for 11 non - active spirals .",
    "the infrared data have been acquired mainly with three telescopes : the 2 m tlescope bernard lyot ( pic du midi observatory , france ) , the 2.5 m dupont telescope ( las campanas , chile ) , and the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto ( spain ) .",
    "we have also used some short observations taken with the eso 2.2 m telescope in la silla for the relative calibration of one of the j images obtained during a non - photometric night .",
    "the journal of observations is presented in table [ journal ] .",
    "we always used nicmos-3 256@xmath7256 detectors ; the pixel scales are given in table [ journal ] .",
    "as seen in table [ sample ] , there are some galaxies with extended angular sizes close to 2 arcmin or even larger , which do not fit in a single frame . for two of them , namely ngc 4779 and",
    "ngc 6951 , a mosaic of images was performed in order to have images for the entire galaxy disk .",
    "the data reduction and calibration was performed , following the standard procedures with the iraf software and sqiid package . for the objects , exposures of typically about 2 minutes ( dithered in short exposures of about 20s in j and 50s in k offset by about 2 - 3 arcsec )",
    "were taken on the source and on the sky , until the total integration time was achieved ( see table [ journal ] ) .",
    "a median dark frame was calculated for every night with the same exposure time than that of the objects by using the corresponding dark frames obtained before and after the observations .",
    "flat - field frames were obtained for each filter by subtracting the median dark frame from the sky frames , normalizing the resulting frames and calculating the median .",
    "we then subtracted the dark frame from the object frame , divided by the normalized flat - field and subtracted the corresponding sky frame .",
    "sometimes , another constant had to be subtracted in order to attain the zero background level . in order to align the resulting frames to better than a pixel fraction we used the non - saturated stars in these frames or ,",
    "when there were no stars , we used the centre of the galaxy . for the flux calibration a number of standard stars were observed and mean extinction coefficients were applied ( k@xmath8 and k@xmath9 in magnitudes airmass@xmath10 are respectively 0.12 and 0.08 for las campanas and la silla , 0.12 and 0.10 for the tbl , 0.057 and 0.042 for the not and k@xmath9=0.1 for calar alto ) . the error level on the standard stars amount to 10% . in column 7 of table [ journal ]",
    "we give the isophotal magnitude / arcsec@xmath11 corresponding to 2@xmath12 of the background .",
    "we have retrieved hst calibrated infrared images obtained with nicmos ( filter f160w ) for the eight galaxies for which such data was available ( see column 1 in table [ journal ] ) .",
    "k images of the galaxies in grey scale with isocontours overlaid are shown if in figs .",
    "1a-28a . all figures are only available in electronic form .    in order to detect the presence of features showing a departure from radial symmetry such as bars and spiral arms , we have used a masking technique .",
    "we filtered the original images with a box of 2 - 3 times the fwhm of the seeing ( median filter ) and divided the observed image by the filtered one .",
    "the resulting images ( hereafter called the sharp - divided images to differenciate them from those obtained by subtraction , i.e. the so - called unsharp masking technique ) are shown in figs .",
    "this technique is very well suited to trace asymmetries in the light distribution , such as bars , spiral arms , dust lanes , rings ; it allows the subtraction of the diffuse background in a very convenient way to look for subtle , small - scale variations and discuss the possible presence of both dust extinguished and more luminous regions ( sofue et al .",

    "1999 ) .",
    "the presence of bars can be determined quantitatively by studying the behaviour of isophotal position angles ( pas ) and ellipticities ( @xmath13s ) : a bar is characterized by a local maximum in the @xmath13 corresponding to a constant pa ( wozniak et al . 1995 ; friedli et al .",
    "1996 ; jungwiert et al .",
    "therefore , we have fit ellipses to the isophotes ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) with the iraf ellipse task in stsdas.analysis.isophote , allowing the center , pa and @xmath13 to vary from one isophote to the next .",
    "foreground stars have been masked out .",
    "the resulting parameters allow the reconstruction of a model galaxy .",
    "the difference between the original image and the model ( hereafter called the difference images ) are particularly useful to trace all the features that can not be described with ellipses , as spiral arms and boxy or peanut - like components .",
    "they are given in figs .",
    "1c-28c and discussed separately for each galaxy .",
    "when the pa suddenly changes from one isophote to the next , the model can not work for the regions left inside ( see figs .",

    "we have fit an exponential to the outermost region ( the disk ) , subtracted it to the observed profile and fit a r@xmath14 law ( the bulge ) to the residual ; this calculation was continued until convergence was achieved ( see mrquez & moles 1996 , 1999 ) .",
