    "the monge - kantorovich equations , @xmath1 appear as a condition of optimality in the classical monge - kantorovich problem of optimal mass transportation with the cost function equal to the distance of transportation @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 are two given distributions of mass , @xmath3 is the transport density , and @xmath4 is the kantorovich potential . let @xmath5 be the set of bounded radon measures on @xmath6 , @xmath7 the subset of nonnegative measures , and @xmath8 the set of real valued lipschitz functions with lipschitz constant not greater than 1 . if @xmath9 and satisfy @xmath10 , there exist a transport density and a corresponding potential , @xmath11 , satisfying ( [ m_bal])-([const_rel ] ) in a weak sense , see @xcite .",
    "if either @xmath12 or @xmath13 are absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure in @xmath6 the transport density @xmath3 is unique and also absolutely continuous @xcite . obviously , the kantorovich potential @xmath4 is determined up to an additive constant .",
    "if the constant is fixed , the potential is still not unique outside spt@xmath14 .",
    "note that the system ( [ m_bal])-([const_rel ] ) arises also in a mass optimization problem @xcite .    a critical - slope model for sand surface evolution ( @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite ) @xmath15 can be regarded as a non - stationary version of the monge - kantorovich equations .",
    "here @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the evolving sand surface , @xmath18 is the intensity of external source , @xmath19 is the tangent of the sand angle of repose , @xmath20 is the sand transport density ( if @xmath21 ) or proportional to it , and the initial surface @xmath22 satisfies the equilibrium constraint @xmath23 .    indeed , it can be proved that if the source intensity @xmath24 is nonnegative , the term @xmath25 is nonnegative too and , as was noted in @xcite , comparison of the two systems shows that at each time moment sand from the source is instantly incorporated into the bulk in a way that minimizes sand transport under the constraint @xmath26 .",
    "the height function @xmath4 plays here the role of kantorovich potential .    in this note",
    "we explore an opposite approach to this similarity .",
    "let the source intensity be a time - independent radon measure , @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 and satisfy @xmath10 . starting with an admissible initial condition @xmath22 , we seek a solution to monge - kantorovich equations as the @xmath29 limit of solution to ( [ h_eq])-([h_rel ] ) . to solve this latter evolutionary problem we employ the numerical algorithm @xcite based on a dual variational formulation of the sand model written for flux of sand pouring down the evolving sand surface @xcite .",
    "to study the evolution of sand surface , it is convenient to exclude from equations ( [ h_eq])-([h_rel ] ) the transport density @xmath3 , the lagrange multiplier related to the constraint @xmath26 , and rewrite the model as a variational inequality for @xmath4 alone . for bounded domains and appropriate boundary conditions ,",
    "the inequality was obtained in @xcite .",
    "similar formulation of the initial value problem has been independently derived and studied in @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "we assume both @xmath32 and @xmath24 have compact supports . in this case",
    "spt@xmath33 remains compact for each @xmath34 , see @xcite .",
    "the inequality ( [ vi1 ] ) can be used for efficient computation of the evolving sand surface @xmath4 .",
    "however , the dual variable , @xmath3 , remains unknown and difficult to find .",
    "such situation is typical also of other critical - state problems . because of this reason the dual variational formulations @xcite , resembling mixed variational inequalities in elasto - plasticity @xcite and allowing to find both variables simultaneously ( see @xcite ) , can be preferable . having in mind the application to monge - kantorovich problem",
    ", we assume @xmath35 and allow for non - constant coefficients @xmath36 to treat problems with , say , subregions through which mass transportation is forbidden or , on the contrary , where it is free of charge .",
    "suppose the pair @xmath37 satisfies the model relations ( [ h_eq])-([h_rel ] ) .",
    "then , for the horizontal projection of surface flux of sand @xmath38 and arbitrary test field @xmath39 we obtain @xmath40 noting that support of @xmath4 is bounded and integrating , we obtain @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and also @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 integrating now the balance equation ( [ h_eq ] ) in time we get @xmath45 and arrive at the mixed variational inequality written for the sand flux alone : @xmath46 for any @xmath47 . here @xmath48 and we define @xmath49^n\\ : \\ \\nabla\\cdot\\bm{\\psi}\\in l^2(r^n)\\}.\\ ] ] several comments about the variational formulation ( [ vi2 ] ) can be necessary .",
    "the problem is not coercive in the usual sobolev spaces .",
    "nevertheless , under suitable conditions on the source function @xmath24 , existence of a solution can be established @xcite .",
    "since the divergence of flux @xmath50 belongs to @xmath51 , we expect the continuity of normal component of sand flux ; the tangential component of @xmath50 can be discontinuous ( this corresponds to continuity of transport density along the transport rays ) . to solve such a problem numerically , one should use the divergence - conforming finite elements that do not enforce any additional smoothness on the solution .",
    "suppose the flux has been found as a solution to ( [ vi2 ] ) . obviously , the transport density is easily determined for @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "the surface @xmath4 ( potential in the monge - kantorovich problem ) can be calculated by means of the equation ( [ u_eq ] ) .",
    "to approximate the inequality ( [ vi2 ] ) numerically , we smoothed the non - differentiable functional @xmath54 by introducing @xmath55 , discretized the regularized equality problem in time , employed the divergence - conforming raviart - thomas finite elements of lowest order ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and used vertex sampling on the nonlinear term . resulting nonlinear algebraic systems were solved at each time level iteratively using a form of successive over - relaxation .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details and make only several remarks related to efficient implementation of this algorithm to monge - kantorovich equations .",
    "\\i ) the needed solutions are obtained as the @xmath29 limit of solutions to ( [ vi2 ] ) with the time - independent sources satisfying @xmath56 . to find this limit , we need not solve the nonlinear equations at each time level with high accuracy : only a few iterations are needed before the transition to a new time level .",
    "if , however , the kantorovich potential is also of interest by some reason , the time step and the number of iterations should ensure accurate calculation of the integral in ( [ u_eq ] ) .",
    "\\ii ) suppose that transportation through an open domain @xmath57 is forbidden .",
    "to model this situation , it is possible to solve the problem in @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "another possibility ( used in this work ) is to solve also in @xmath57 but set @xmath60 .",
    "then , if @xmath50 solves ( [ vi2 ] ) , the flux @xmath61 must be zero . since the normal component of flux is continuous , only tangential to domain boundary flux of mass",
    "is permitted : the optimal mass transportation rounds the obstacle .",
    "\\iii ) numerical solution of ( [ vi2 ] ) is possible only in a bounded domain and it is desirable to make the computational domain as small as possible .",
    "however , if the domain is not large enough , at some ( depending on @xmath22 ) time moment spt@xmath62 can reach the domain boundary . to avoid any material loss through the boundary , we can surround the domain by an obstacle ( see previous comment ) .",
    "on the other hand , we do not want the artificial obstacle to affect our solution .",
    "since the transport set in monge - kantorovich problem ( without obstacles ) consists of straight transport rays that begin in spt@xmath63 and end in spt@xmath64 , we can choose any computational domain containing the convex hull of spt@xmath65spt@xmath66spt@xmath64 and surround it by an obstacle .",
    "our choice of domain ( and @xmath22 ) can influence only the kantorovich potential outside the establishing in @xmath29 limit transport set , where this potential is not unique .    in all examples below , the computations were performed in a square surrounded by an obstacle ( we set @xmath67 in a thin border around the square ) .",
    "matlab partial differential equation toolbox was used for generation of finite element meshes . + _",
    "example 1_. support of @xmath12 consists of two upper ellipses in which the density of @xmath12 is 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the mass from @xmath12 is to be uniformly distributed in the third ellipse below .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) . in this case",
    "the transport density is not absolutely continuous : it becomes concentrated on part of the obstacle boundary ( see also @xcite for analysis of transport density in a sandpile growth problem with an obstacle ) .    ;",

    "[ fig3 ] be a  highway \" where the transportation cost is significantly reduced . to model this situation , we set @xmath68 in the polygon ( which makes transportation through this area hundred times cheaper ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the optimal transportation in this case is concentrated mostly upon the highway .    ;",

    "we used formally the similarity of the monge - kantorovich equations and a model for sand surface evolution to present solutions to monge - kantorovich equations as stationary points of a dynamical system and find them numerically .",
    "we note that , although it remains to prove rigorously the solutions to non - stationary problem do have the @xmath29 limit , numerical examples confirm this statement and demonstrate the efficiency of our approach .",
    "our hypothesis is the convergence , in fact , occurs in a finite time .",
    "it seems interesting to give also an ",
    "optimal mass transportation \" interpretation of sand model equations .",
    "let @xmath69 and @xmath70 be , respectively , the production and consumptions rates of some homogeneous commodity and @xmath71 its initial distribution .",
    "let , at any time moment , the local price of this commodity be defined as @xmath72 , i.e. , the price is positive if there is a deficit , @xmath73 , and is negative if there is a surplus @xmath74 which needs storing .    whenever the price difference between two arbitrary points , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , exceeds the cost of transportation of one commodity unit from one of these points to another , @xmath77 , the prices adjust themselves instantaneously , since a cheaper price is available by buying elsewhere and transporting",
    ". condition of price equilibrium can thus be written in the form latexmath:[$|u(x)-u(y)|\\leq    initial distribution of goods @xmath22 satisfies this condition , we describe its further evolution driven by production and consumption as @xmath79 and assume that the mass flux @xmath50 is always directed towards the price gradient : @xmath38 , where @xmath80 is an unknown scalar function .",
    "finally , if @xmath81 , the transportation from one of these points to another can only increase the cost and is unprofitable .",
    "locally , this can be reformulated as the condition @xmath82 , which brings us to the critical - state model ( [ h_eq])-([h_rel ] ) in which all transport occurs at the border of equilibrium .",
