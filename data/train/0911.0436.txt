    "in the standard scenario of structure formation , galaxies are surrounded by extended dark matter haloes , which form by gravitational instability seeded by some initial density fluctuation field @xmath1 . according to the simple spherical collapse model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , a halo of mass @xmath2 collapses at a redshift @xmath3 when the linear density fluctuation field - smoothed on a scale @xmath4 - first exceeds some critical threshold @xcite .",
    "small systems collapse at higher redshifts when the universe was denser , and then merge hierarchically to form larger haloes .",
    "galaxy clusters are at the top of this hierarchy : they represent the most massive virialized structures in the present - day universe , and may host thousands of galaxies .",
    "recent studies , using high resolution numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have shown that the cores of subhaloes accreted along the host merging history may survive until the present - time to form the so - called substructure population .",
    "different studies of galaxy formation and evolution have attempted to correlate such substructures with satellite galaxies , with conflicting results .",
    "@xmath5-body simulations of galaxy - size haloes seem to predict more substructures than observed @xcite .",
    "a number of different solutions to this ` substructure problem ' have been suggested , among others early cosmic reionization @xcite , mass loss and gas stripping @xcite , and a downturn in the power spectrum at small scales @xcite .    from the observational point of view",
    ", recent kinematic analyses of milky - way satellites @xcite have shown that , if galaxy formation in low - mass dark matter haloes is strongly suppressed after reionization , the circular velocity function of simulated cdm subhaloes can be brought into approximate agreement with the observed circular velocity function of the milky way satellite galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite claim instead that there is no missing satellites problem if one considers the scatter in the substructure mass function due to the different formation history of the haloes .",
    "the idea here is that the milky - way and andromeda haloes reside within an underdense region , so they accreted their substructures at above average redshifts ( compared to other objects of the same mass today ) , and so they are expected to possess fewer satellites ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "knowledge of the substructure population is important , not only for galaxy formation studies , but also for estimating the expected observable @xmath6-ray flux from dark matter particle annihilations within the milky way .",
    "the expected flux depends strongly on the substructure population , its spatial distribution within the halo , and on the dm particle cross section @xcite .",
    "the observed thickness of stellar disks in spiral galaxies is another imprint of the substructure population of the host haloes .",
    "semi - analytical models @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite show that merging events in the central region of the halo are responsible for disk thickening .",
    "hence , the substructure mass function , its redshift evolution and the satellite accretion rate all represent key ingredients for a more complete model of the disk structure of spiral galaxies , not to mention flares , bars , and faint filamentary structures above the disk plane .",
    "different algorithms have been proposed to identify substructures in simulated dark matter haloes .",
    "all these algorithms yield subhalo mass functions that resemble a power - law at the low mass end with a logarithmic slope in the range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 @xcite , both at redshift @xmath0 and at higher redshifts . in this work",
    "we highlight some differences among four such methods and present a new subhalo finder which we believe is useful for studies of galaxy formation and evolution in that it is directly linked to the merger tree of the host halo .",
    "in this paper we focus on the study of the `` dark '' subhalo population and on its redshift evolution , to help clarify the role of dark matter and its dynamics in the structure formation history . in section  [ bkgnd ]",
    "we describe several substructure identification algorithms already in the literature , including the one we will be modifying .",
    "section  [ sim ] describes the cosmological @xmath5-body simulation we use , and the required post - processing .",
    "our new algorithm to identify substructures , and an analytic fit to the resulting subhalo mass function is presented in section  [ r2 ] .",
    "section  [ r3 ] discusses how the scatter in the substructure mass fraction at fixed mass and at different redshifts correlates with the formation history , and other structural parameters of the halo .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in section  [ sc ] . in appendix [ previous ]",
    "we compare the results of this paper with two previous ones : @xcite and @xcite that studied the substructures population on the same cosmological simulation but with different algorithms . in appendix [ massris ]",
    "we propose some fitting functions useful to rescale the virial radius and mass when different definitions of the enclosed virial density are adopted .",
    "to date , several different algorithms have been proposed to identify substructures within simulated dark matter haloes , and different definitions have been adopted by several authors .",
    "* @xcite used an algorithm called skid . at each simulation snapshot ,",
    "skid estimates the density of each particle using a cubic spline kernel ; each particle is then moved along the density gradients until it oscillates around a local density maximum .",
    "particles are then linked using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite , and the groups thus found are pruned iteratively to retain only self - bound particles .",
    "however , to obtain the full substructure mass skid requires a user - defined choice for the linking length to be used by the fof algorithm .",
    "also @xcite implemented an analogous algorithm to identify substructures by moving particles up density gradients and identifying groups as all particles reaching the same density maximum .",
    "in addition , they also implemented a method to identify a hierarchy of subhaloes within subhaloes .",
    "@xcite improved the algorithm of determining the energetically bound components of a subhalo taking into account also all the forces , both internal and external , exerted on the subhalo .",
    "* @xcite developed subfind , which defines subhaloes as locally overdense , self - bound particle groups .",
    "subfind runs on individual simulation snapshots , but can afterwards reconstruct the full merger tree of each subclump , by using the subhalo information from previous snapshots @xcite . the density of each particle ( assumed as tracers of the three - dimensional dark matter density field ) is estimated using an sph - fashion scheme : the local smoothing scale is set to the distance of the @xmath9 nearest neighbor , and the density estimated by kernel interpolation over these neighbors . locally overdense regions are identified by imitating such a lowering of a global density threshold .",
    "any locally overdense region enclosed by an isodensity contour that traverses a saddle point is considered as a substructure candidate .",
    "all subhalo candidates are also examined and unbound particles are removed and redistributed . this algorithm has been used and tested by different authors @xcite .",
    "in particular subfind has been run on the largest existing simulation of the milky way @xcite .",
    "* @xcite and @xcite used mlapm @xcite , an adaptive mesh refinement code for cosmological simulations , to locate substructures in host haloes . to identify haloes and subhaloes at each simulation output , they first build a list of potential centers by storing the centroid of the densest grid point at the end of each grid tree s `` branch '' .",
    "assuming that each density peak in the adaptive grid of mlapm corresponds to the centre of a halo or subhalo , they step outwards in ( logarithmically spaced ) radial bins until the mean enclosed overdensity reaches the critical virial value @xmath10 @xcite , thus defining @xmath11 .",
    "however , subhaloes do not extend out to their original virial radius , but rather to some truncation radius @xmath12 , where an upturn in the radial density profile is detected . this rise is encountered because substructures are embedded in the background of the host halo .",
    "* @xcite and @xcite developed and optimized the code surv , which identifies subhaloes within the virial radius of the final host by following their progenitors from the time they were first accreted by the host main progenitor .",
    "hence , surv differs from the methods discussed above in that it uses prior information based on the merger tree of a host halo at redshift @xmath13 to identify its subhaloes . for each progenitor halo @xmath14 that has been accreted onto the main progenitor",
    ", surv identifies a subhalo as the subset of particles that belonged to @xmath14 at the moment of accretion ( @xmath15 ) and are still part of a self - bound entity at @xmath13 within the corresponding tidal radius . for each subhalo",
    "thus identified , surv stores the accretion time , @xmath16 , the original virial mass ( i.e. , the mass at @xmath17 ) , as well as the evolution of its orbital parameters after accretion . in this paper",
    "we extend surv by following all branches of the merger tree ( rather than just the main branch ) , in order to reconstruct the full hierarchy of substructure down to the mass resolution of the simulation ( i.e. , we aim to identify sub - subhaloes , sub - sub - subhaloes , etc ) .",
    "we used the data from gif2 @xcite , a cosmological @xmath5-body simulation which is available at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/virgo[`http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/virgo ` ] .",
    "the simulation followed the evolution of @xmath18 dark matter particles , each of mass @xmath19 , in a periodic cube of comoving side @xmath20mpc within which the background cosmology was @xmath21cdm with ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) = ( 0.3 , 0.9 , 0.7 , 0.0196 ) .",
    "we made use of @xmath26 snapshots , mostly logarithmically spaced in time between @xmath27 and @xmath0 .",
    "these are sufficiently closely spaced in time that one can reconstruct accurate halo and subhalo merger trees @xcite .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more details about the gif2 simulation and the post - processing .    , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 that give rise to a population of subhaloes@xmath31 .",
    "system @xmath30 has accreted satellite haloes itself ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , before it was accreted by the host .",
    "those that survive ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) give rise to a population of subhaloes@xmath35.[treefig ] ]      for each simulation snapshot , haloes are identified using a spherical overdensity criterion : first we determine the local dark matter density at the position of each particle , @xmath36 , by calculating the distance to the tenth closest neighbor , @xmath37 .",
    "we assign to each particle a local density @xmath38 , sort particles in density and take as centre of the first halo the position of the densest particle .",
    "we then grow a sphere around this centre , and stop when the mean density within the sphere falls below @xmath39 as dictated by the spherical collapse model . for a flat universe",
    ", this is approximated to better than one percent by @xmath40 \\right )   \\label{felix}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "for the gif2 cosmology , @xmath43 times the critical density at @xmath0 , and it increases with redshift , asymptoting to @xmath44 at early times . in appendix  [ massris ] we present fitting functions that allow halo radius , mass and concentration to be converted to those appropriate for other values of @xmath45 .",
    "at this point we assign all particles within the sphere to the newly formed halo , and remove them from the global list .",
    "we take the centre of the next halo at the position of the densest particle among the remaining ones , and grow a second sphere .",
    "we continue in this manner until all particles are screened .",
    "we include in our catalogue only haloes with at least @xmath46 particles within the virial radius ; particles not ending up in any halo are considered as ` field ' or ` dust ' particles .",
    "hereafter we will refer to the virial mass of a ( host ) halo thus identified at redshift @xmath3 as @xmath47 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     because of the exponential cutoff in the subhalo mass function , equation   can not be integrated analytically .",
    "however , we have found that @xmath48 is well fit by @xmath49}. \\label{fitsubmf}\\ ] ] a similar functional form has been used to fit galaxy velocity dispersions @xcite , so our parametrization is intended to help clarify the connection between galaxies and halo substructure . to determine the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath6 and @xmath52 , we perform a least - squares fit to the log of the counts at the small mass end",
    ": this determines the slope @xmath51 and zero - point @xmath53 of the power law at small masses .",

    "table  [ tabfin ] lists the resulting best fit parameters . as can be seen from the last column of the table , the shape is fit to an accuracy of about @xmath57 .",
    "solid curves in the figure show the halo+substructures mass function .    when @xmath58 , equation  ( [ nusube ] ) becomes @xmath59     \\label{gammamf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the normalization of the halo mass function and @xmath61 .",
    "the dot - dashed curves in figure  [ mysub ] show this approximation .",
    "clearly , neglecting the high - mass exponential cut off is not a good approximation .",
    "we estimated the mass function of substructures by following all the branches ( rather than just the main branch ) of the merger history tree of a halo .",
    "this distribution , @xmath62 , depends on the mass of the host halo , when the halo was identified , and its formation time .",
    "however when the number of substructures per host halo mass is considered , the distribution turns to be `` universal '' at a given redshift , but simulations with higher mass resolution are required to determine if this is true even when the host halo mass is smaller than @xmath63 .",
    "this universal shape is characterized by a power law of slope @xmath64 at low masses , times an exponential cut - off when the substructure mass approaches that of the host halo .",
    "this distribution can be integrated to obtain the substructure virial mass fraction and the mean number of clumps at a given host halo mass .    at fixed host halo mass ,",
    "the haloes which formed at higher redshift tend to have less substructure .",
    "in addition , more massive host haloes have more substructures than less massive ones .",
    "the first trend arises because satellites which spend more time in the potential well of their host lose a larger fraction of their initial mass ( or can be totally disrupted ) .",
    "massive haloes formed more recently , so this same mechanism explains the second trend .",
    "similar trends are seen if we replace halo formation time ( which is not observable ) with the concentration parameter of the halo density profile ( which is ) .",
    "we also showed that the poisson model , with a mean that depends on host halo mass , is a reasonable description of the substructure counts within a host halo .",
    "however , the second and third factorial moments of the substructure counts are @xmath65 percent larger than for a poisson model with the same mean counts .",
    "as observations improve , this may become important in halo model parametrization of large scale structure which relate halo substructure to galaxies .    at fixed mass ,",
    "the mean number of substructures above some minimum mass is larger at high redshift . although this is not unexpected  the higher redshift haloes have had less time to destroy their substructures  we argued that the redshift dependence could be well - approximated by assuming that the anti - correlation between substructure abundance and host halo concentration we measure at @xmath0 does not evolve . at fixed mass ,",
    "higher redshift haloes are less concentrated  in effect , our assumption is that the same physics which affects the concentrations also affects the substructure .",
    "this allows us to provide a simple prescription for the redshift evolution of substructures , which we use to provide analytic approximations for the result of integrating the substructure mass function over all host halo masses .",
    "these results should find use in halo model interpretations of the ( evolution of the ) galaxy clustering signal in large scale sky surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "our new substructure algorithm is a modification of that in @xcite and is rather different from that of @xcite .",
    "our new algorithm returns smaller substructure mass fractions , especially at large host halo masses , than did our old one ( i.e. , that of * ? ? ? * ) ) ; it is more conservative about identifying self - bound structures .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ massfs ] , where the change at the high mass end is more than @xmath68 .",
    "it is smaller at the low mass end , where the host halo masses are approaching that of the mass resolution of the subhaloes .",
    "this shows explicitly that if one wants to think of our new algorithm as taking the subhaloes of @xcite and partitioning them up into smaller substructures , then some of the subhalo mass from the old algorithm is now assigned to the host halo rather than to substructures .",
    "the new value of the substructure mass fraction for the most massive haloes agrees pretty well with other algorithms , that give values around @xmath69 of the host halo mass we found respectively @xmath70 and @xmath71 of @xmath72 to be in substructures . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "the changes in mass fraction between the two algorithms shown in figure [ massfs ] can be understood also considering the fact that when we split a subhalo in pieces ( sub - subhaloes ) , we must also recompute the centre - of - velocity ( from which we compute the kinetic energy ) and , more importantly , we calculate the new potential energy only using the new subsets of particles .",
    "this forces the new potential energy to be less negative than before ( i.e. the same particle is assigned a less negative potential energy than before , because the potential wells are shallower ) , and so many particles which reside in - between the density peaks of the various sub - subhaloes , even if they were bound to the subhalo as a whole , happen to be unbound to any of the sub - subhaloes , and often are unbound to the main subhalo itself .",
    "this is because the splitting removed all the secondary density peaks , so the global potential well becomes shallower decreasing the self - bound mass of the clumps .    ]",
    "figure  [ all3 ] compares the substructure mass functions found by our algorithm , that of @xcite , and the subhalo mass function of @xcite . to facilitate comparison with @xcite",
    ", we have chosen to use the same mass bins and host halo definition as @xcite ; i.e. , host haloes are @xmath73 times the critical density .",

    "note that @xmath76 , with the difference increasing at late times ( lower redshifts ) .",
    "our new algorithm ( open symbols ) takes the subhaloes returned by our old algorithm ( triangles ) and partitions them up into smaller pieces ; it removes objects from large @xmath77 and adds objects to @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting distribution is indeed very similar to that found by @xcite using subfind ( crosses ) .",
    "the dashed and the dot - dashed lines show the fit - by - eye of the cluster size halo by @xcite and @xcite .     found by our algorithm , that of @xcite ( subfind ) , and the subhaloes@xmath31 of @xcite.[all3 ] ]    figure  [ all3 ] , which shows @xmath79 , is the analog of figure  [ survf ] in the main text",
    ". however , in our discussion of @xmath80 in the main text , we found that the normalization of our substructure mass function appeared to be larger that that reported by @xcite , and we argued that this could be attributed to the difference in how we define host halo masses . since the definitions are the same here , figure  [ all3perm200 ] shows @xmath81 , which is the analog of figure  [ subuv ] .",

    "note , here @xmath2 corresponds to @xmath74 in the case of the solid triangles and to @xmath82 in the case of the open circles .",
    "[ zfvirzf200 ] ]    in addition , we argued in the main text that because @xmath84 , the host halo formation times for haloes of a given @xmath74 should be higher than those for haloes that have the same numerical value for @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ zfvirzf200 ] shows that this is indeed the case . as a result",
    ", we generically expect @xmath74 haloes at the present time to have less substructure than haloes with the same numerical value of @xmath82 ( for comparison see figure [ subuv ] ) .",
    "in the spherical collapse model , the density within the virial radius @xmath11 is assumed to be @xmath10 times the critical density at the time of virialization , where @xmath85 is given by equation  ( [ felix ] ) . in principle , this can be used as a criterion to identify bound objects . however , because the details involved in approximating the timescale to virialization are not well understood , this density is not the only one which has been used to identify haloes in simulations .",
    "for example @xcite and related papers , and @xcite , define haloes as being @xmath73 times the mean background density . the corresponding radius , @xmath86 , is larger than @xmath11 at @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite and related papers define haloes as having average densities @xmath73 times the critical density .",
    "the corresponding radius @xmath87 is smaller than @xmath88 at @xmath0 .",
    "note that all three definitions become comparable at high redshift .          to rescale the different mass definitions we estimate @xmath91 and @xmath93 at various @xmath3 by computing @xmath87 and @xmath86 from the density profile of our selected haloes ( which were defined to have sizes @xmath88 ) .",

    "halo density profiles are will fit by the functional form of @xcite ; this form has a characteristic scale @xmath104 , where the density profile changes slope , and the concentration is defined as the ratio of this scale to the virial radius .",
