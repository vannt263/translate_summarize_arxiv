    "one of the most important issues in particle physics today is to understand the origin of cp violations . indeed",
    ", many efforts have been made to measure cp violations in various processes .",
    "so far , for the @xmath4 system , non - vanishing values of the @xmath0 and @xmath5 parameters have been observed .",
    "in addition , cp violation in the @xmath6 process , i.e. , the angle @xmath7 , is also called the angle @xmath8 . in this paper , however , we do not use this notation since we use the angle @xmath8 to parameterize the vacuum expectation values of two higgs bosons . ]",
    "is now being measured by the on - going @xmath9-factories , and even at the present stage non - vanishing cp violation in this process is reported @xcite .    in the framework of standard model ( sm ) , the most well - known mechanism to explain these cp violations",
    "is to introduce the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) matrix @xcite which contains one physical complex phase for the three family case . that is , using the wolfenstein parameterization @xcite : @xmath10 the parameter @xmath11 parameterizes the size of the cp violation .",
    "importantly , the measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath7 are used to constrain the parameters in the km matrix .",
    "currently , all the measurements of the cp violations more or less suggest the same region on the @xmath12 vs.  @xmath11 plane , and hence the observed cp violations are well explained in the framework proposed by kobayashi and maskawa . in the near future , some of the measurements of the cp violations will become more precise @xcite .",
    "in addition , there will be other constraints on the @xmath12 vs.  @xmath11 plane from various new processes like @xmath13 and decay processes of @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons .",
    "these processes will provide important tests of the unitariry of the km matrix and the origin of the cp violations .",
    "in particular , if some new physics exists , it may provide a new source of the cp violation which may be seen as a deviation from the sm prediction on the @xmath12 vs.  @xmath11 plane .",
    "of course , possible deviations depend on featrures of new physics beyond the standard model . among various models , in this paper",
    ", we consider one of the most well - motivated ones , that is , supersymmetric ( susy ) unified model with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "such a model can solve some of the theoretical and experimental problems which can not be solved in the framework of sm .",
    "first , in the supersymmetric theories , the serious naturalness problem can be avoided because of the cancellation of the quadratic divergences between bosonic and fermionic loops .",
    "in addition , in the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) , successful gauge coupling unification can be realized contrary to the standard - model case where three gauge couplings do not meet at any high energy scale .",
    "furthermore , in this framework , solar and atmospheric neutrino problems @xcite may be solved by small neutrino masses generated by the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "thus , supersymmetric unified theories with right - handed neutrinos are theoretically and experimentally well - motivated , and it is worth studying its phenomenological consequences . in this context",
    "there have been some phenomenological studies @xcite which obatained interesting results in some processes .    in this paper , we study the cp violating processes in the kaon system in the framework of supersymmetrics grand unified theories ( guts ) with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "and @xmath9 sysytems in the framework of susy sm without the right - handed neutrino have been discussed in @xcite . ] indeed , in such models , there are many possible new physical phases in the soft susy breaking parameters , which may affect various cp violating processes .",

    ", the gluon - penguin diagram generates the operators @xmath259 with @xmath265 , and hence their wilson coefficients are of @xmath266 where @xmath267 indicates the coupling constants for the electroweak interaction . on the contrary ,",
    "the operators @xmath268 with @xmath269 are only from the electroweak processes and the corresponding wilson coefficients are of @xmath270 .",
    "although the wilson coefficients contributing to the @xmath249 amplitude are smaller than those contributing to the @xmath271 one , both amplitudes are significant since the @xmath249 contribution has extra enhancement factor .    from the effective hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ h_epspr ] ) , @xmath3 is given by ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath272      \\nonumber \\\\ & &      + ( l\\rightarrow r ) ,      \\label{e'/e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath273 denotes the two - pion state with isospin @xmath274 , and @xmath275 with @xmath276 numerically , @xmath277 .",
    "in addition , @xmath278 is from the isospin breaking in the quark masses , and numerically we use @xmath279 @xcite . since @xmath280 is a small number , the @xmath249 contribution in eq .",
    "( [ e/e ] ) , which is proportional to @xmath281 , is enhanced relative to the @xmath271 contribution .",

    "one important observation is that , in mssm , @xmath249 contribution can be largely enhanced relative to the standard model case @xcite .",
    "this is because the @xmath249 contribution is , as mentioned before , of @xmath270 in the standard model while it can be of @xmath282 in mssm if the mass matrix of the down - type squarks has non - vanishing 1 - 2 element .",
    "combining the fact that @xmath249 contribution is enhanced by the factor @xmath283 , the susy contribution to the @xmath3 parameter can be order of magnitude larger than the experimental value .",
    "thus , in some case , constraint on the cp and flavor violating parameters in mssm from @xmath3 becomes severer than that from @xmath0 .",
    "as we will see below , the susy contribution to @xmath3 is relatively small in our framework . before showing the numerical results ,",
    "let us explain how the the smallness of @xmath3 is understood in our framework compared to the result given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a first step ,",
    "let us briefly review how the large susy contribution is realized in ref .",
    "the most important enhancement is for the the @xmath170-type @xmath249 amplitude by the factor of @xmath284 relative to the sm contributions .",
    "the same enhancement also exists for the @xmath262- and @xmath263-type operators .",
    "however , in taking the relevant matrix elements of the @xmath170-type operators , there is a chirality - enhancement factor proportional to @xmath285 , and hence the @xmath170-type operators are more important than the @xmath262- and @xmath263 ones .",
    "since the @xmath249 amplitude is an isospin - breaking effect , a mass difference between the up- and down - squark masses is necessary . for the right - handed up- and down - squarks , significant mass splitting",
    "is realized if the susy breaking mass parameters for them take different values . on the contrary ,",
    "the left - handed ones are both from the su(2)@xmath108-doublet . as a result ,",
    "their mass splitting is only from the electroweak symmetry breaking effect ( i.e. , vacuum expectation values of the higgs bosons ) , and the mass splitting between left - handed squarks is too small to generate significant contribution to the isospin - breaking amplitude .",
    "thus , in order to generate @xmath170-type operators , sizable 1 - 2 element of the left - handed down - type squark mass matrix is necessary . in summary ,",
    "the condition for the large susy contribution to @xmath3 is ( i ) mass splitting of between @xmath286 and @xmath137 , and ( ii ) non - vanishing imaginary part of @xmath287_{12}$ ] . combining all of these effects",
    ", the susy contribution to @xmath3 can be as large as @xmath288 when @xmath289_{12}/m^2_{\\tilde{d}})\\sim 10^{-2}$ ] .",
    "now , we turn to our case . in our framework , large off - diagonal elements are generated for the right - handed down - type squark mass matrix since they are related to the neutrino yukawa interactions .",
    "since sizable mass splitting between up- and down - type squarks is possible only for the right - handed sector , only the @xmath263-type contribution is modified for the @xmath249 process , and hence the chirality enhancement is not significant for @xmath290 process . in addition , if we take the universal boundary condition for the squark masses , mass splitting between @xmath286 and @xmath137 is fairly small . as a result ,",
    "correction to the @xmath249 amplitude becomes small .    to make more quantitative discussion",

    "it is notable that , in our simple analysis , universal scalar mass is assumed as a boundary condition .",
    "consequently , mass splitting between the right - handed up- and down - type squarks becomes small since the masses of these squarks are mostly determined by the boundary condition and the rg effect due to the gluino loop below the gut scale which are universal in this case . as a result , masses of the right - handed up- and down - type squarks are quite degenerate , and this fact gives another suppression factor for the @xmath249 contribution .",
    "since the contributions to the @xmath271 and @xmath249 amplitudes are both small , the susy contribution to the @xmath3 parameter is also at most a few % level in our framework .",
    "in this paper , we discussed cp violations in the supersymmetric su(5 ) model with right - handed neutrinos . in this class of model ,",
    "off - diagonal elements of the right - handed down - type squarks are generated via the rg effect even if they vanish at the cut - off scale ( i.e. , in our case , the reduced planck scale ) . in general ,",
