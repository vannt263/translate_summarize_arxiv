    "with the on set of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) era , unique opportunity to probe the realm of new physics in the tev scale has begun .",
    "models with extra spatial dimensions and tev scale gravity , are proposed to address the large hierarchy between the electroweak and planck scale and are expected to provide a plethora of new and interesting signals .",
    "the extra dimension model proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) @xcite , was the first extra dimension model in which the compactified dimensions could be of macroscopic size and consistent with present experiments .",
    "a viable mechanism to hide the extra spatial dimension , is to introduce a 3-brane with negligible tension and localise the standard model ( sm ) particles on it .",
    "only gravity is allowed to propagate in the full @xmath6 dimensional space time . as a consequence of these assumptions",
    ", it follows from gauss law that the effective planck scale @xmath7 in 4-dimensions is related to the @xmath6 dimensional fundamental scale @xmath8 through the volume of the compactified extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the extra dimensions are compactified on a torus of common circumference @xmath9 .",
    "the compactified extra dimensions are flat , of equal size and could be large . the large volume of the compactified extra spatial dimensions would account for the dilution of gravity in 4-dimensions and hence the hierarchy .",
    "current experimental limits on deviation from inverse square law @xcite , constraint the number of possible extra spatial dimensions @xmath10 .",
    "the space time is factorisable and the 4-dimensional spectrum consists of the sm confined to 4-dimensions and a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes , of the graviton propagating in the full @xmath6 dimensional space time .",
    "the interaction of the kk modes @xmath11 with the sm fields localised on the 3-brane is described by an effective theory given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy - momentum tensor of the sm fields on the 3-brane and @xmath14 is the reduced planck mass in 4-dimensions .",
    "the relation between the 4-dimensional coupling , the volume of the extra dimensions and the fundamental scale @xmath15 in @xmath6-dimensions @xmath16 the size of the extra dimension @xmath9 is related to the radius @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the fundamental scales in @xmath6 dimensions , as defined in @xcite @xmath15 is related to @xmath8 @xcite as : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the surface area of a unit sphere in @xmath21 dimensions .",
    "the zero mode corresponds to the usual 4-dimensional massless graviton and higher massive kk modes are labeled by @xmath22 .",
    "the masses of the individual kk modes are @xmath23 and the mass gap between adjacent kk modes is @xmath24 . for not too large @xmath21 the discrete mass spectrum",
    "could be replaced by a continuum , with the density of kk states @xmath25 for an inclusive cross section at the collider , we have to sum over all accessible kk modes and hence cross section for the production of an individual kk mode of mass @xmath26 has to be convoluted with the density of states @xmath27 .",
    "the discrete sum @xmath28 can be replaced by @xmath29 , and hence the inclusive cross section for the tower of kk modes is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the cross section to produce a single kk mode .",
    "the cross section for an individual kk mode is suppressed by the coupling factor @xmath32 , the high multiplicity of accessible kk modes at the collider would compensate , leading to the exciting possibility of observing low scale quantum gravity effects at the lhc .",
    "the additional @xmath33 factor is due to the definition of the sum of polarisation of the kk modes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 is kinematically constrained to those kk modes which satisfy @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the partonic center of mass energy or as the case may be the available energy to produce the kk modes .",
    "viable signatures of the add scenario at the lhc are possible by the exchange of virtual kk modes between the sm particles , leading to an enhanced cross section or by the emission of real kk modes from the sm particles , leading to a missing energy signal .",
    "various such processes have been extensively studied in this model , most of which have been considered only up to leading order ( lo ) in qcd @xcite .",
    "these lo approximations at the hadron colliders suffer from large factorisation and renormalisation scale dependence which for some processes could be as large as a factor of two .",
    "these issues go beyond normalisation of a cross section by a @xmath36-factor as the shapes of distributions may not be modeled correctly and in addition the lo cross sections are strongly dependent on the factorisation scale .",
    "it is hence essential to evaluate the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the process of interest to provide quantitatively reliable predictions .",
    "nlo qcd corrections to extra dimension models have been studied for dilepton @xcite , boson pair @xcite productions , and real graviton production processes such as graviton plus jet @xcite and graviton plus photon @xcite .",
    "searches at the tevatron using the single photon or jet with missing transverse energy have been used to put bounds on extra dimensional scale @xmath15 for different number of extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the same signal has been simulated for the lhc at the atlas detector @xcite , discovery limit and the methods to determination of the parameters of the extra dimensional models are discussed .    in this paper",
    "we consider the graviton production in association with a vector boson at the hadron colliders at nlo in qcd .",
    "z - boson process to lo had been considered at lep @xcite and simulation studies for the @xmath37 modes production at the lhc was studied to lo @xcite as a complement to the more conventional channels .",
    "the associated production of z - boson with the kk modes of the add model leads to missing energy signals at the hadron colliders .",
    "we begin by discussing the neutral weak gauge boson ( @xmath0 ) production in association with the kk modes of the add large extra dimensional model to nlo in qcd and would consider the charged weak gauge bosons ( @xmath1 ) towards the end .    at the hadron collider",
    ", the associated production @xmath38 at lo proceeds via the quark , anti - quark annihilation process @xmath39 .",
    "there are four diagrams that would contribute to this process , which corresponds to the kk modes of the graviton being emitted of a fermion leg , z - boson or the @xmath40 vertex .",
    "the feynman rules to evaluate the matrix elements are given in @xcite and for the vector boson , unitary gauge ( @xmath41 ) is used .",
    "summation of the polarisation tensor of the kk modes is given in @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the terms proportional to the inverse powers of kk mode mass @xmath42 vanish on expressing the matrix element square in terms of independent variable and is an useful check .",
    "the nlo calculation presented here uses both analytical and monte carlo integration methods and hence is flexible to incorporate the experimental cuts and can generate the various distributions unlike a fully analytical computation .",
    "our code is based on the method of two cutoff phase space slicing @xcite to deal with various singularities appearing in the nlo computation of the real diagrams and to implement the numerical integrations over phase space .",
    "the analytical results are evaluated using the algebraic manipulation program form @xcite .",
    "the real and virtual corrections have been evaluated in the massless quark limit .",
    "we use dimensional regularisation with space time dimensions @xmath43 . to deal with @xmath44 in @xmath45-dimensions , we use the completely anti - commuting @xmath44 prescription @xcite .",
    "the order @xmath46 corrections to the associated production of the z - boson and kk modes of the graviton come from the following @xmath47 real diagrams ( a ) @xmath48 , ( b ) @xmath49 .",
    "there are 14 diagrams that contribute to the quark antiquark annihilation process and can be classified into diagrams where the kk modes couples to the ( i ) fermion legs , ( ii ) z - boson leg , ( iii ) gluon leg , ( iv ) @xmath40 vertex and ( v ) @xmath50 vertex .",
    "the unitary gauge is used for the z boson propagator and feynman gauge for the gluon propagator .",
    "note that the gauge parameters influence the coupling of kk modes to the sm fields @xcite .",
    "for the sum over the polarisation vectors we have retained only the physical degrees of freedom .",
    "the real diagrams involving gluons and massless quarks would be singular in soft and collinear regions of the 3-body phase space integration .",
    "two small slicing parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 are introduced to isolate regions of phase space that are sensitive to soft and collinear singularities .",
    "rest of the region is finite and can be evaluated in 4-dimensions .",
    "phase space integrations in the mutually exclusive soft and collinear regions are performed not on the full matrix element but in the leading pole approximation of soft and collinear regions in @xmath53 dimensions .",
    "the soft and collinear poles now appear as poles in @xmath54 and in addition the soft part would depend logarithmically on the soft cut - off @xmath51 while the collinear part would depend on the both @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "all positive powers of the small cut - off parameters are set to be zero .",
    "the phase space degrees of freedom that remain , correspond to a 2-body process and can now be combined with the virtual diagram .",
    "the virtual corrections to the annihilation process to order @xmath55 can be obtained by considering the gluonic virtual corrections to the vertex and wave function renormalisation for the process @xmath56 and then attaching the kk modes to all possible legs and vertex as allowed by the feynman rules @xcite .",
    "this would generate 27 , one loop @xmath57 diagrams which on multiplication with the @xmath58 at lo would give all the virtual contributions for the annihilation process . performing the loop integrals in @xmath53 dimensions would lead to poles in @xmath54 in the soft and collinear regions and combining this with the real diagrams would lead to the cancellation of the soft singularities . the remaining collinear singular terms which appear as poles in @xmath54 are systematically removed by collinear counter terms in the @xmath59 factorisation scheme , at an arbitrary factorisation scale @xmath60 .",
    "the resultant expression is now finite but depends on the cut - off parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 logarithmically . combining this @xmath57 part with the finite @xmath47 part and performing the phase space integration for the various distributions ,",
    "it is expected that the results be independent of the choice of the slicing parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath61 process begins at @xmath46 so does not get any virtual corrections to this order and can be obtained from the @xmath47 annihilation diagrams by using the crossing symmetry .",
    "the analytical results of lo @xmath62 , finite part of nlo virtual corrections and full @xmath63 matrix elements that go into our numerical code will be presented in the longer version @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the numerical results for the associated production of the @xmath0-boson with the kk modes at the lhc ( @xmath64 tev ) to nlo in qcd .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0-boson and the weak mixing angle are taken to be @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "the fine structure constant is taken to be @xmath67 . through",
    "out our computation we have used cteq6 l / m parton density sets @xcite and @xmath68 light quark flavors .",
    "the two loop running strong coupling constant in the @xmath59 scheme has been used with the corresponding @xmath69 gev .",
    "unless mentioned other wise , both the renormalization and the factorization scales are set to @xmath70 , the transverse momentum of the @xmath0-boson .",
    "further , the following cuts have been implemented in our numerical code : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the rapidity of the @xmath0-boson , @xmath73 gev and the missing transverse momentum @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 at lo , the missing transverse momentum @xmath74 is the same as @xmath76 .",
    "the additional jet at nlo can be soft or hard ; for the soft jet the @xmath74 is the same as @xmath76 while for hard jet @xmath74 is @xmath77 of the kk modes ( eq .  ( [ ptmiss ] ) ) .",
    "in addition to the above , we have put a cut on the pseudo rapidity of the jet @xmath78 for @xmath79 gev .",
    "we check the stability of our results against the variation of the slicing parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 introduced in the slicing method . in fig .",
    "[ deltas ] , we present the dependency of both the @xmath80-body and @xmath81-body pieces of the @xmath46 contribution on @xmath51 , keeping the ratio @xmath82 fixed . these results are obtained for a specific choice of the add model parameters @xmath83 tev and @xmath84 . it can be seen from the figure that the sum of these two pieces is positive and is fairly stable for a wide range of @xmath51 .",
    "the positive sum implies that the qcd corrections do enhance the leading order predictions . in the rest of our work",
    ", we choose @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    in fig .",
    "[ ptz ] , we present the transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath0-boson at the lhc to nlo in qcd and its dependence on the number of extra dimensions @xmath21 for @xmath83 tev . in each of the distributions corresponding to @xmath87 the qcd effects are found to have increased the leading order predictions considerably . in this transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath0-boson , the @xmath36-factor , defined as the ratio of nlo cross sections to the lo ones ,",
    "is found to increase with @xmath76 and vary from 1.1 to 1.46 depending on the number of extra dimensions @xmath21 . in a similar way",
    ", the missing transverse momentum distribution is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ trunc ] .",
    "the add model which is an extension of the sm to address the hierarchy problem is an effective theory and the uv completion of the tev scale gravity has to be quantified .",
    "for the real kk mode production process , the kinematical constraint discussed earlier , provides a natural uv cutoff on the integration over the n - sphere , but the hard scattering scales involved at the lhc energies can be close to the fundamental scale @xmath15 . to study the sensitivity of our results close to the uv region @xcite , we compare at lo and nlo the @xmath88 distribution of z - boson wherein the invariant mass of the kk mode and z - boson @xmath89 is ( a ) computed only when @xmath90 ( _ truncation _ ) and ( b ) computed for all possible values of @xmath89 ( _ un - truncation _ ) . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ trunc ] , we compare the results for the add model parameters , @xmath91 tev and @xmath92 at lo and nlo for the @xmath88 distribution . as compared to the un - truncated distribution , the percentage difference",
    "is tabulated below for lo and nlo for a few values of @xmath76 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the difference between the un - truncated and truncated results become larger with ( a ) increase in @xmath76 , ( b ) increase in the number of extra dimensions @xmath21 and ( c ) decrease in the fundamental scale @xmath15 .",
    "further it is seen that the nlo qcd corrections do decrease the difference between the un - truncated and truncated results .    finally , we study the dependence of both lo and nlo cross sections on the factorization scale @xmath60 by varying it from @xmath93 to @xmath94 .",
    "one of the motivations for the computation of the qcd corrections is to minimise the scale uncertainties by computing the cross sections to higher orders in the perturbation theory .",
    "as expected , the scale uncertainties in the leading order predictions are considerably decreased after incorporating the one - loop qcd corrections to the associated production of the @xmath0-boson and the kk modes at the lhc .",
    "the results are shown in the fig .",
    "[ scale ] ( left ) for the case of transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath0-boson , for @xmath83 tev and @xmath84 . in fig .",
    "[ scale ] ( right ) we have also plotted the @xmath88 distribution for the current lhc energies of @xmath95 tev .",
    "the k - factor ranges from 1.05 to 1.13 for @xmath96 gev .",
    "the contribution of @xmath97 subprocess for the @xmath95 tev is much smaller than the contribution at @xmath98 tev and that accounts for the much lower k - factor .    it is interesting to note here that a similar analysis goes through for the associated production of @xmath1 and the kk modes in the large extra dimensional model at the lhc .",
    "the difference lies both in the couplings of the quarks to the weak bosons and in the respective parton fluxes to be convoluted with the partonic cross sections . in fig .",
    "[ w- ] we have plotted the @xmath99 distribution for @xmath100 tev at lo and nlo . for the @xmath101 distribution",
    "the k - factor is in the range 1.25 - 1.37 for @xmath102 gev .",
    "a complete analysis of the associated production of @xmath1 in association with kk modes of the add model will be presented in the longer version @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we have computed the nlo qcd corrections to the associated production of the vector boson at the lhc , using semi - analytical two cutoff phase space slicing method .",
    "we have presented results for @xmath103 14 and 7 tev .",
    "our results are checked for the stability against the variation of the slicing parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we have studied the truncated as well as the un - truncated transverse momentum distributions of the @xmath0-boson , together with the missing transverse momentum distribution and their dependence on the number of extra dimensions @xmath21 .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections are found to have not only enhanced the lo cross sections considerably , with the k - factors ranging from 1.1 to 1.46 depending on the @xmath104 for @xmath83 tev , but also decreased their factorization scale uncertainties significantly .",
