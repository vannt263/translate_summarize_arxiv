    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy is a very powerful observational probe of cosmology .",
    "the recent _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) data have provided a precise determination of standard cosmological parameters reaffirming an emerging concordance model of cosmology , structure formation @xcite and , even inflation and the early universe .",
    "this remarkable success story is almost entirely based on the measurements of the angular power spectrum , @xmath2 , of the cmb anisotropy .    in standard cosmology ,",
    "the cmb anisotropy @xmath3 is expected to be statistically isotropic , i.e. , the statistical expectation values of @xmath3 are preserved under rotations of the sky .",
    "the issue of statistical isotropy ( si ) applies to both gaussian and non - gaussian cmb sky maps .",
    "here we limit our study to the gaussian cmb anisotropy field , where the two - point correlation function contains all the statistical information encoded in the field .",
    "the importance of si is based on a very well known fact : if the two point correlation is rotationally invariant , one can equivalently completely specify cmb anisotropy in terms of the legendre transform , @xmath2 , the widely used angular power spectrum of cmb .",
    "when the si holds , the information of the full cmb data set can be compressed into a multipole spectrum .",
    "after the recent release of the first year of _ wmap _ data , the si of the cmb anisotropy has attracted considerable attention .",
    "tantalizing evidence of si breakdown ( albeit , in very different guises ) has mounted in the _ wmap _ first year sky maps , using a variety of different statistics .",
    "it was pointed out that the suppression of power in the quadrupole and octopole are aligned @xcite .",
    "further `` multipole - vector '' directions associated with these multipoles ( and some other low multipoles as well ) appear to be anomalously correlated @xcite .",
    "there are indications of asymmetry in the power spectrum at low multipoles in opposite hemispheres @xcite .",
    "possibly related , are the results of tests of gaussianity that show asymmetry in the amplitude of the measured genus amplitude ( at about @xmath4 to @xmath5 significance ) between the north and south galactic hemispheres @xcite .",
    "analysis of the distribution of extrema in _ wmap _ sky maps has indicated non - gaussianity , and to some extent , violation of si @xcite .",
    "however , what is missing is a common , well defined , mathematical language to quantify si ( as distinct from non gaussianity ) and the ability to ascribe statistical significance to the anomalies unambiguously .",
    "these results provide considerably increased motivation for this letter in which we test the _ wmap _ data for si , in detail , using the bipolar power spectrum ( bips ) of cmb anisotropy , a powerful and easy to understand statistics , which was recently introduced to the field of cmb analysis @xcite .",
    "if si is violated , the @xmath2 do not contain all the statistical information of a gaussian sky map .",
    "it is described by the whole set of cross - correlations of the coefficients in the harmonic space @xmath6 .",
    "the cosmic variance of the elements will prevent us from estimating the individual elements from a single map .",
    "hence , it is very important to define a statistic that condenses the information of that matrix into a single spectrum that reduces the cosmic variance .",
    "bips does exactly that . furthermore it is easy to interpret and straightforward to implement for very rapid computation",
    "in spherical harmonic space representation where @xmath7 , the condition for si translates to a diagonal @xmath8 where @xmath2 , is a complete description of ( gaussian ) cmb anisotropy . when @xmath9 is not diagonal , the off - diagonal elements contain information beyond @xmath2 .",
    "the bips is a combination of these off - diagonal elements in @xmath10 , containing extra non - si information .",
    "the bips together with @xmath2 give a complete , orientation independent description of a gaussian cmb anisotropy map .",
    "the bips of cmb is defined by  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the coefficients of the bipolar spherical harmonic ( biposh ) expansion of the correlation function , which is the most general expansion of @xmath13 : @xmath14 biposh functions are the natural complete basis on @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath12 are a complete set of linear combinations of off - diagonal elements of @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "every specific measure of off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix @xmath19 suggested in the literature @xcite can be expressed in terms of @xmath12 . for an si correlation function @xmath20 , implying @xmath21 and @xmath22 . an equivalent real space description of the bips in terms of appropriately weighted averages of the correlation @xmath23 is given in previous publications @xcite .",
    "we compute the bips using fast methods of spherical harmonic transform of the map   and apply filters in multipole space using the appropriate positive definite window function @xmath24 .",
    "we define an unbiased estimator for the biposh coefficients and then estimate @xmath25 ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 , is the bias that arises from the si part of the correlation function . although bips is quartic in @xmath28 , it is designed to detect si violation and not non - gaussianity .",
    "consequently , for si correlation , the measured @xmath29 will be consistent with zero within the cosmic variance .",
    "cosmic error , @xmath30 , and bias , @xmath31 , are given by equations ( 14 ) and ( 17 ) of @xcite respectively , with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the total si angular power spectrum of the `` true '' signal and noise .",
    "multipole space windows that weigh down the contribution from the rest of the si region of the multipole space will enhance the signal relative to cosmic error , @xmath30 .",
    "it is important to note that bias can never be subtracted exactly for a non - si map .",
    "what is important is whether the measured @xmath34 differs from zero at a statistically significant level .",
    "it is not inconceivable that for strong si violation , @xmath31 over - corrects for the bias leading to negative values of @xmath29 .",
    "the noise covariance is a possible source of si violation .",
    "however , we have restricted our analysis to @xmath35 where the errors are dominated by the cosmic variance .",
    "we carry out measurement of the bips , @xmath25 , on two full sky cmb anisotropy maps  ( a ) the internal linear combination map ( denoted as `` ilc '' in the figures ; @xcite ) , and ( b ) a foreground cleaned map ( denoted as `` tegmark '' ; @xcite ) . the angular power spectra of these maps , shown in figure [ cl_wmap_cl100 ] , are consistent with the best fit theoretical power spectrum from the _ wmap _ analysis .",
    "we use simple filter functions in @xmath36 space to isolate different ranges of angular scales . a low pass , gaussian filter @xmath37 , \\label{gaussfilter}\\ ] ] which cuts off power on small angular scales ( @xmath38 ) , and a band pass filter , @xmath39 \\})\\,w^g_l(l_s)%\\exp(-(l+1/2)^2/(l_s+1/2)^2 ) \\label{bpfilter}\\ ] ] which retains power within a range of multipoles set by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the window functions used in our work are plotted in figure [ cl_wmap_cl100 ] .",
    "we use the _ wmap _ best - fit ( wmapbf ) @xmath2 to generate 1000 simulations of the si cmb maps .",
    "the @xmath28 are generated up to an @xmath36 of 1024 ( corresponding to maps at healpix resolution @xmath42 ) .",
    "these are then multiplied by the window functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 and the bips for each realization is computed",
    ". we use @xmath45 to analytically compute the bias and the cosmic variance for @xmath46 .",
    "the average and standard deviation of @xmath46 of the si maps are also estimations of the bias and the cosmic variance .",
    "we verified that the theoretical cosmic variance and bias match the numerical estimations of standard deviation and average @xmath46 of the @xmath47 realizations of the si maps .",
    "the bips of the full - sky cmb maps ( a ) and ( b ) based on the _ wmap _ first - year data is computed in the same manner .",
    "we use the wmapbf @xmath45 to compute the bias and cosmic variance analytically .",
    "using the analytical bias and cosmic variance allows us to rapidly compute bips with 1 @xmath48 error bars for different theoretical @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ kappa_wmap_3020 ] shows the measured values of @xmath25 for maps ( a ) and ( b ) for two of the window functions .",
    "we compute the bips for all the window functions shown in figure [ cl_wmap_cl100 ] .",
    "the bips measured from the @xmath47 simulated si realizations of wmapbf @xmath2 is also used to estimate the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) , defined as @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ prob3020 ] ) .",
    "we compute the individual probabilities of the map being si for each of the measured @xmath46 .",
    "the probabilities for the @xmath53 window function are greater than @xmath54 and the minimum probability at @xmath55 occurs at @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for systematically lower si probabilities for @xmath58 as compared to @xmath59 is simply due to the lower cosmic variance of the former .",
    "the contribution to the cosmic variance of bips is dominated by the low spherical harmonic multipoles .",
    "filters that suppress the @xmath28 at low multipoles have a lower cosmic variance .",
    "it is important to note that this probability is a conditional probability of the measured @xmath60 being si given the theoretical spectrum @xmath45 used to estimate the bias .",
    "a final probability emerges as the bayesian chain product with the probability of the theoretical @xmath45 used given data .",
    "hence , small differences in these conditional probabilities for the two maps are perhaps not significant . the important role played by the choice of the theoretical model for the bips measurement",
    "is shown for a @xmath24 that retains power in the lowest multipoles , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "assuming wmapbf @xmath45 , there are hints of non - si detections in the low @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ kappa_wmap_0_4 ] , _ top _ ) .",
    "we also compute the bips using a @xmath45 for a model that accounts for the suppressed quadrupole and octopole in the _ wmap _ data @xcite .",
    "the mild detections of a non zero bips vanish for this case ( fig .",
    "[ kappa_wmap_0_4 ] , _ bottom _ ) .",
    "this suggests that the excess power in the wmapbf @xmath45 with respect to the measured @xmath2 from _ wmap _ at the lowest multipoles tends to indicate mild deviations from si .",
    "the si of the cmb anisotropy has been under scrutiny after the release of the first year of _ wmap _ data . using a bips analysis",
    "we find no strong evidence for si violation in the wmap cmb anisotropy maps .",
    "we have verified that our null results are consistent with measurements on simulated si maps .",
    "it is also possible to construct a model - independent `` frequentist '' estimator of bips that uses the @xmath2 of the map itself to compute the bias .",
    "measurements on our simulated sky maps show that cosmic variance for this estimator is much smaller .",
    "the preliminary results on the same set of observed maps are consistent with si and will be reported later .",
    "work is in progress to verify them against analytical results .",
    "the full - sky maps and the restriction to low @xmath35 ( where instrumental noise is sub - dominant ) permits the use of our analytical bias subtraction and error estimates . the excellent match with the results from numerical simulations is a strong verification of the numerical technique .",
    "this is an important check before using monte - carlo simulations in future work targeting the @xmath64 regime , which involves a galactic mask and a non - uniform noise matrix .",
    "there are strong theoretical motivations for hunting for si violation in the cmb anisotropy .",
    "the possibility of non - trivial cosmic topology is a theoretically well - motivated possibility that has also been observationally targeted @xcite .",
    "violation of si is a generic feature of cosmic topology @xcite . and the bips expected in flat , toroidal models of the universe has been computed and shown to be related to the principle directions in the dirichlet domain @xcite . hence , the null result of bips have important implications for cosmic topology .",
    "this approach complements the direct search for the signature of cosmic topology , and our results are consistent with the absence of the matched circles and the null s - map test of the _ wmap _ cmb maps @xcite .",
    "work is in progress to combine a full bayesian likelihood analysis with bips analysis to constrain cosmic topology @xcite , in particular the recently proposed dodecahedron universe @xcite .",
    "we defer to future publication , detailed analysis and constraints on cosmic topology using null bips measurements .",
    "other theoretical scenarios that predict the breakdown of si are also being probed using bips , e.g. , primordial cosmological magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "observational artifacts such as foreground residuals , non - circular beam , inhomogeneous noise correlation , residual stripping patterns , etc .",
    "are potential sources of si breakdown .",
    "our null bips results confirm that these artifacts do not significantly contribute to the maps studied here .",
    "in summary , we find null measurements of the bips for a selection of full - sky cmb anisotropy maps based on the first year of _ wmap _ data .",
    "our results rule out radical violation of statistical isotropy , and are consistent with null results for matched circles and the s - map tests of si violation .",
    "we find that the excess power at low @xmath36 in the best - fit theory @xmath2 with respect to @xmath2 derived from the _ wmap _ maps tends to enhance the si violation signatures in bips .",
    "our result is an unambiguous , well - defined , quantitative evaluation and assessment of the si of the cmb anisotropy . but pending a more careful comparison , the results do not necessarily conflict with a number of other statistical tests that have suggested violation of statistical isotropy .",
    "we should also mention that our null bips results do not have any bearing on the non - gaussianity of the maps .",
    "the authors are very thankful for close interaction with david spergel and glenn starkman all through the project , including careful reading and valuable comments on previous drafts of this letter .",
    "we also acknowledge useful discussions with dick bond , dmitry pogosyan , and carlo contaldi .",
