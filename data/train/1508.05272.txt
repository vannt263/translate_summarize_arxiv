    "fig : dlczlvl1 ] ) can not be controlled , such that phase coherence between neighboring nodes needs to be established at optical frequencies .",
    "the relative phase of the photonic state depends on the position of the detector  @xcite which requires that the fiber link between qr nodes must be interferometrically stabilized . for details concerning the interferometric stability of fiber links , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the rate of entangled pairs would benefit mostly from an improved transfer of the entangled photon to the detection apparatus , which is typically mainly limited by the coupling efficiency between the fiber cavity mode and the fiber mode .",
    "we realistically aim for increasing the mode matching @xmath233 from @xmath332 to @xmath333 .",
    "ultimately we are limited by the geometry of our setup to @xmath334 . for small values of the transfer and detection probability @xmath30 ,",
    "the entanglement rates increase only linearly with mode matching , by at most @xmath335  % .",
    "similar gains could be achieved by reducing mirror losses to optimize the impedance matching , eq .",
    "[ eq_eta - impedance ] , or by optimizing the ratio of reflectivity of the two cavity mirrors to improve the cavity outcoupling coefficient @xmath232 .    for the _ two - photon dlcz _ ,",
    "decreasing the rate does not improve the fidelity of bell states .",
    "consequently , its performance is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvr ] by single points . in this protocol ,",
    "the ionic state is created by a bichromatic optical field ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , which allows for a phase control by an rf - link . during the photon transmission",
    "only the global phase of the photonic state is altered , which means the stability of the fiber link needs to ensure temporal coincidence of both of the photons impinging at the beamsplitter , but interferometric stability is not required  @xcite .",
    "any improvement of the mode matching would be most important for this protocol , as this parameter enters quadratically in eq .",
    "[ eq : dlcz2suc ] . a gain in performance ( up to a 51  % increase for the optimized mode matching ) is expected for a more precisely aligned fiber cavity . concerning the _ hybrid protocol _ , the larger the parameters @xmath300 or @xmath299",
    "are chosen , the more the rate is increased , at the cost of fidelity .",
    "this follows from eqs .",
    "[ eq : hybf ] and [ eq : pusd ] which mirrors the mixing of pure and entangled states described in sec .",
    "[ sub : hyb ] .",
    "the protocol needs optically phase - stable lasers , as a monochromatic field is used to create the initial ionic state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hqclvl ] ) .",
    "interferometric stability for the fiber link is not required : the quantum information in the qubus is transmitted together with a local oscillator pulse , and a homodyne - type measurement eliminates all phases collected by both those parts during transmission , also in the case of usd detection .",
    "the hybrid protocol would benefit , similar to the dlcz protocols , from an improved the mode matching between fiber cavity and fiber , as well as an improved impedance matching .",
    "realistically , we could improve the mode matching to @xmath336 which would yield an almost two orders of magnitude larger entanglement generation rate with @xmath337 .",
    "in the hybrid and single - photon dlcz protocols we might alleviate the requirement for inter - node phase coherence of lasers with an alternative way of creating the superposition of the @xmath338- and @xmath339-states : creating a coherent superposition between the two @xmath107-zeeman states using a raman laser interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lvl ] )  @xcite , followed by a coherent population transfer from one of those sublevels to the d - state via rapid adiabatic passage ( rap ) . after entanglement as been generated , each qubit could be coherently returned to the spin qubit by a second rap , before the necessary local operations are performed . the phase coherence between qr nodes",
    "would then be ensured by a rf reference exchange .    in conclusion and taking above discussion into account , we note that the epr protocol shows a comparatively small rate of entanglement generation and can hardly be implemented in our ion trap - cavity platform . however , for both the dlcz protocol and the hybrid protocol utilizing usd , the estimated rates and fidelities for our parameters suggest the possibility of outperforming the state - of - the - art @xcite , where free - space photon collection is employed .",
    "both protocols would profit from a fiber optical cavity with a high reflectance end mirror on the multimode fiber  @xcite .",
    "if the losses in the mirror coatings and the transmission through the high reflectance mirror could be brought well below 50  ppm , the cavity outcoupling coefficient would improve to a value that we estimate with @xmath340 .",
    "this would double @xmath232 and in turn @xmath30 for both dlcz protocols , see eq .",
    "[ eq : dlczdet ] . furthermore , with @xmath341 , these conditions could let the hybrid usd protocol reach a rate of @xmath342  s@xmath5 for a state fidelity of @xmath343 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvr ] ) .",
    "we discussed the implementations of three quantum repeater protocols , namely the distributed epr protocol , the dlcz protocol and the hybrid protocol , and various protocol extensions with an ion trap setup . when comparing the protocols , we find that the dlcz protocol and the hybrid protocol outperform the epr protocol .",
    "the most important limitations are of technical nature .",
    "we see that improving the mode matching from the experimentally determined value of 0.44 to 0.54 , which can be achieved through an improved cavity alignement , entanglement generation rates of 30  s@xmath5 at fidelities of 0.9 with the dlcz protocol are within reach .",
    "furthermore , the impedance matching of the fiber optical cavity may be improved by coating the mirror of the i / o fiber with a different transmission coefficient as compared to the high reflection end mirror on the multimode fiber , which would allow a rate of up to 60  s@xmath5 .",
    "the hybrid protocol appears interesting for future investigations , even though we would need to change the fiber cavity : the quick entanglement generation rate at medium - high fidelity makes it an ideal candidate to be used in combination with entanglement distillation schemes  @xcite . that requires a rate of entanglement generation exceeding the decay rate of the stationary quantum memory .",
    "the qubit s coherence time is , in our case , limited by magnetic field fluctuations to 10  ms , which means that for an optimized hybrid rate of up to @xmath344  s@xmath5 at @xmath343 , already more entanglement per time would be created than lost .",
    "encoding the stationary qubit in a decoherence - free substate  @xcite and executing the mapping between qubus and logical qubit comprised of a two - ion bell state  @xcite with a coherence time on the order of 10  s would improve the ratio of entanglement distribution time to coherence time to @xmath345 .",
    "yet another option is the use of error correction codes in entanglement distribution .",
    "the basic code in @xcite requires 2 ancilla qubits per qubit , few enough to be realized in our setup , without the need to build multiple traps per qr node .",
    "furthermore , combining our platform with a single photon wavelength converter to provide compatibility with telecom fibers opens up a promising perspective of evolving our system from a lab based proof - of - principle experiment to a prototype , which may increase the maximally achievable distance for quantum communication .",
