    "the @xmath1he nucleus is an example of a three - cluster system whose lowest threshold ( @xmath3 ) is a three - particle one .",
    "such systems have a number of remarkable properties determined mainly by two factors  the pauli principle and the character of the potential energy dependence due to the three - body structure .",
    "the pauli principle imposes essential restrictions on the wave function of a system allowing it to contain only the components antisymmetric with respect to nucleon permutation .",
    "thus , if we are using the expansion over the harmonic - oscillator basis , we must solve the problem of excluding the states forbidden by the pauli principle @xcite .",
    "this , in particular , leads to the fact that the simplest wave function of the @xmath4-state of @xmath1he obtained with the translation - invariant shell model ( it coincides with the lowest oscillator - basis function ) is a superposition of states with three - particle hypermomentum @xmath5 ( @xmath6% ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this function generates an infinite set of states differing by a number of oscillator quanta and having almost the same ratio of @xmath5 and @xmath7 components . the approximation using only this set of functions",
    "can be appropriately called the @xmath0-approximation .",
    "other basis states contain components with @xmath9 whose weight is small , as shown in @xcite .",
    "notice that for @xmath10-states , wave functions of the @xmath0-approximation contain only @xmath7 components , while for the @xmath11-states they are the superpositions of @xmath12 ( @xmath13[1.ex]{\\mbox{$\\,\\stackrel{\\scriptstyle>}{\\scriptscriptstyle \\sim}\\,$}}}}25\\%}$ ] ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath13[1.ex]{\\mbox{$\\,\\stackrel{\\scriptstyle<}{\\scriptscriptstyle \\sim}\\,$}}}}75\\%}$ ] ) components .",
    "the second characteristic feature of systems under consideration is the slow decrease of their potential energy for large values of the hyperradius @xmath15 .",
    "as known ( see for example @xcite ) , in three - body systems , the potential energy has the asymptotical behaviour @xmath16 as @xmath17 , even if the two - body forces acting between any two of constituent particles are short - range .",
    "this fact leads to two important results .",
    "first , the boundary of a system is extremely loose and the rms radius is significantly larger compared with that of those neighbouring nuclei whose three - particle threshold is much higher than the binary one .",
    "second , the phase shift of the three - body scattering rises sharply at low energies ( it is proportional to @xmath18 as @xmath19 ) which directly affects the behaviour of the electromagnetic transitions matrix elements between the ground state of @xmath1he and its continuous spectrum .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to give a detailed quantitative analysis of general regularities in @xmath1he structure , based on a simple model taking into account the main features of a loosely - bound system with the lowest three - particle threshold .",
    "the allowed basis functions for states with zero angular momentum @xmath20 of the @xmath0-approximation have the following form _",
    "n(l=0 ) = a_0(n)_n0()u_0 ( ) + a_2(n)_n2()u_2 ( ) , where the superposition coefficients are a_0(n ) = ,   a_2(n ) = , @xmath21 are the hyperspherical functions , _ nk ( ) = n_nk ^k e^-^2/2 l^k+2_n(^2 ) are the normalized hyperradial harmonic - oscillator basis functions , @xmath22 are the laguerre polynomials , @xmath23 are the normalizing coefficients , @xmath24 therefore , the wave function of the @xmath25 state in the @xmath0-approximation is reduced to the expansion ( l=0 ) = _",
    "[ 3 ] for all @xmath26 , the contribution of @xmath7 states is significantly greater than that of the @xmath5 states 0.86 <",
    "a_2 ^ 2(n ) < 0.96 ;   a_0 ^ 2(n ) = 1 - a_2 ^ 2(n ) , hence , in a simple model , the contribution of @xmath5 states can be neglected .",
    "then , for the expansion ( [ 3 ] ) the following relations hold ( l=0 ) = _ n=0^ c_n _ n2()u_2 ( ) = ( ) u_2 ( ) = ( ) ^5/2 u_2 ( ) .",
    "the function @xmath27 should satisfy the one - dimensional schrdinger equation + v()= e , [ 5 ] where @xmath28 is the nucleon mass , @xmath29 is the hypermomentum ( @xmath7 for @xmath25 ) , @xmath30 is the effective three - body potential .",
    "the equation ( [ 5 ] ) is a starting point for the subsequent discussion .",
    "it was solved by a numerical integration over @xmath15 from zero to a certain sufficiently large cutoff radius @xmath31 .",
    "the effective potential is modelled by a function v ( ) = v_0 , [ 6 ] having correct asymptotics and without a singularity at @xmath32 . to reproduce the states with zero angular momentum",
    ", we have chosen the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that the equation ( [ 5 ] ) would give experimental values for the @xmath1he binding energy and the rms radius , @xmath35 mev , @xmath36  fm .",
    "the appropriate values of the parameters are v_0 = -87   mev ,   a = 3.073   fm . with these values",
    "we have calculated the wave function of the @xmath1he ground state and @xmath4-states of its continuous spectrum .",
    "the wave function of the ground state of @xmath1he together with the effective potential @xmath30 are presented in fig .  1",
    ". the horizontal line below the @xmath15-axis corresponds to the ground state energy , its intersection with the potential energy curve marks the classical turning point .",
    "the vertical line separates the values of @xmath15 less than @xmath37  fm .",
    "the wave function falls as @xmath38 for small @xmath15 , due to the strong kinematical barrier , while for large @xmath15 , the long - range character of the potential @xmath30 leads to the slow decrease of the wave function and , respectively , to a significant diffuseness of the boundary of a nuclear system .    as known",
    ", loosely - bound binary systems with a short - range potential can be rather well approximated outside the potential range by the exponential function ( ) ( -r ) ,  = , [ 8 ] where @xmath39 is the bound state energy , @xmath40 is the radial variable of the binary channel .",
    "the formal criterion of validity of such an approximation ( the zero - range approximation ) is the smallness of a ratio of the potential range and the cluster radii to the system radius @xmath41 expressed in terms of binding energy .",
    "it seems useful to compare the exact wave function obtained after the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) with the approximation given by eq .  ( [ 8 ] ) ( for @xmath42 fm@xmath43 , dashed line in fig .  1 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the nucleon system is much more loose than it is predicted by the wave function ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the reason for that is not only that the function @xmath27 at small @xmath15 behaves as @xmath38 as @xmath44 , but first of all that the effective potential energy decreases slower than the exponential , while the formula ( [ 8 ] ) is obtained by supposing that the potential is short - range . as a result ,",
    "the estimates of the square of hyperradius mean value @xmath45 based on ( [ 8 ] ) are about three times less than the experimental value .",
    "of course , for sufficiently large @xmath15 the function @xmath27 has the asymptotics ( ) ck_4 ( ) c ( - ) , [ 10 ] where @xmath46 is the macdonald function , and the value of the coefficient @xmath47 ( it is related to the so - called nuclear vertex constants , see @xcite ) is considerably less than that of @xmath48 c 0.12   fm^-1/2 < 0.66   fm^-1/2 .",
    "this asymptotics is denoted by short - dashed line in fig .  1 .",
    "of the special interest are the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) for the continuous spectrum for relatively low over - threshold energies .",
    "in particular , attention must be paid to the question of the behaviour of the three - to - three scattering phase @xmath50 as a function of energy in a potential field with the asymptotical behaviour @xmath51 and the powerful kinematic barrier @xmath52 corresponding to @xmath7 .",
    "according to the estimates @xcite , at low energies , the phase shift , as is also demonstrated by our calculations , is proportional to @xmath53 ( or @xmath18 ) ak +  ;   a = 3.95  fm .",
    "the low - energy values of @xmath54 calculated with different values of the cutoff radius @xmath31 are presented as functions of @xmath53 in fig .",
    "2 . as seen , @xmath31 should be rather large , at least 1000  fm for energies below 10 kev .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath55 gives a rather reasonable prediction for the ground - state energy of @xmath1he _ approx .",
    "= ^22m1a^2 1.3  mev ,  ( cf .",
    "= 0.97  mev ) .",
    "the three - body phase shift @xmath50 calculated with different @xmath31 as functions of energy @xmath56 in an interval up to 5 mev are presented in fig .",
    "as seen , for reliable calculations for medium - energy region ( @xmath57  mev ) @xmath31 may be taken about 50  fm and only for the lowest energies it must be increased .",
    "the phase shift rises steeply from zero to values exceeding @xmath58 for @xmath59 and then slowly goes down . when the phase shift is near @xmath58 the first maximum of the wave function moves closer to zero so that the matrix element of the isoscalar transition from the ground state into the continuous spectrum increases ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "this matrix element reaches its maximal value for @xmath60  mev which could directly affect the electrodisintegration cross - section of @xmath1he .",
    "the @xmath0-approximation satisfying the pauli principle for the @xmath10-states of @xmath1he contain only the hyperspherical function with @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , to obtain the wave functions @xmath27 of @xmath10-states , we again turn to the equation ( [ 5 ] ) with @xmath7 but with the other parameters of the potential @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath1he nucleus has no @xmath10 bound state but it has a @xmath10-resonance at the energy of 0.822@xmath610.025 mev with the width 0.113@xmath610.020 mev @xcite . the energy and the width of the resonance can be reproduced with the following parameters of potential : v_0 = -92   mev ,   a = 2.834  fm .

    "5 . for small @xmath15",
    "the resonance wave function behaves similarly to the wave function of the ground state ( dashed line in fig .  5 )",
    "but for larger @xmath15 , in the asymptotical region it , as it should be , oscillates .",
    "the scattering phase shift in the @xmath10-state obtained by solving the equation ( [ 5 ] ) with the new potential parameters is presented in fig .",
    "6 . at the energy of about 1",
    "mev the phase shift has a typical behaviour for a resonance region .",
    "we have also calculated the matrix element of the operator of the isoscalar @xmath62 transition from the ground state of @xmath1he to the @xmath10-states of its continuous spectrum .",
    "the dependence of this matrix element upon the energy is presented in fig .",
    "the narrow peak observed for the energy about @xmath63  mev again demonstrates the small width of @xmath10 resonance and the large value of the matrix element .",
    "the simple three - cluster model based on the phenomenological long - range potential with the pauli principle taken into account has allowed us to reveal a number of regularities both for the weakly - coupled ground state of @xmath1he and for the states of its continuous spectrum for the relatively low ( up to a few mev ) energies .",
    "the large value of the rms radius in the ground state can be explained by the considerable diffuseness of the wave function caused by the slowly - decreasing effective potential .",
    "the asymptotic region , where the wave function decreases exponentially begins only at the hyperradius values greater than 1520  fm .",
    "the phase shift of elastic scattering ( @xmath64 ) is proportional to @xmath53 or @xmath18 at low energies which leads to the sharp maximum of the matrix element of the isoscalar transition from the ground state to the @xmath4-states of the continuous spectrum .",
    "finally , our calculations predict a considerable enhancing of the probability of the radiative capture of two neutrons by the alpha - particle for the energy corresponding to the @xmath10-resonance of @xmath1he ."
