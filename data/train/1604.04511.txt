    "the large recent interest in non - abelian topological phases of matter is strongly motivated by the possibility of a fault - tolerant topological quantum computation @xcite based upon non - abelian anyons @xcite that appear as quasiparticle excitations for such exotic quantum phases of matter .",
    "the errors caused by local interactions with the environment are a basic obstacle for quantum computation .",
    "the main idea behind topological quantum computation is that non - abelian anyonic quasiparticles can be used to encode and manipulate information in a way that is resistant to errors , and therefore to perform fault - tolerant quantum computation without loss of information ( decoherence ) .",
    "the understanding of the origin and properties of non - abelian states of matter is also of fundamental importance and is at the frontier of current theoretical and experimental research @xcite .",
    "the main objective is the investigation of new models that have non - abelian quasiparticle excitations , or support non - abelian defects , as a result of complex interplay between topology and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the robustness against small local perturbations is due to the topological nature of these states of matter , that therefore can be used as building blocks for topological quantum computation .    in this paper",
    "we study a system of ultra - cold dipolar bosons trapped in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice and at an average filling of @xmath0 atoms per lattice site .",
    "the system can be well described by an extended bose - hubbard hamiltonian with the on - site and nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite .",
    "we study the ground states and low energy elementary excitations of the system in the regime of small tunneling between lattice sites and identify the region of the parameter space where the system supports non - abelian , su(2)@xmath1 fibonacci anyon excitations .    in 1d quantum statistics",
    "is not well defined .",
    "the interchange of two quasiparticles in one spatial dimension is impossible without one particle going through another .",
    "therefore the adiabatic exchange ( braiding ) of these quasiparticles is not possible in the strictly 1d system that we have considered .",
    "however , braiding can be achieved by connecting these 1d systems with t - junctions into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) network as suggested previously in the case of majorana quantum wires @xcite .",
    "our results show that the system supports fibonacci anyon excitations in the regime where ( quasi)degenerate manifolds of energy states are well defined , without crossings between the energy levels within different manifolds .",
    "this regime corresponds only to a part of the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) region in the phase diagram of the system , while the system has nontrivially ( quasi)degenerate ground states in the whole cdw region .",
    "as indicated in previous studies @xcite , fibonacci anyon excitations correspond to fractional domain walls between different cdws .",
    "also , contrary to previous calculations based on gutzwiller wavefunction approach @xcite , our results demonstrate that the super - solid ( ss ) phases are not present between the super - fluid ( sf ) and cdw regions of the phase diagram of the system for the specific average filling of 3/2 atoms per lattice site considered throughout this paper .",
    "the system for arbitrary fillings has also been considered by batrouni _",
    "@xcite where the ss phases were observed at other higher fillings . still at the particular value of @xmath2 the autors of @xcite were unable to verify the presence of the ss phases .",
    "we claim that instead , decreasing the tunneling strength between the neighboring sites leads to a direct , berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) , super - fluid ( sf ) to charge - density - wave ( cdw ) quantum phase transition .",
    "the anyonic quasiparticles , which are neither fermions nor bosons , are associated to systems in two spacial dimensions .",
    "namely , when two quasiparticles are exchanged in two dimensions , the wavefunction of the system can gain any phase factor @xmath3 , which motivated the name anyons . on the other hand in three spacial dimensions",
    "the only possible phase factors are @xmath4 or @xmath5 , which corresponds to bosons or fermions .",
    "if in addition there are @xmath6 degenerate states @xmath7 ( @xmath8, ...",
    ",@xmath6 ) for @xmath9 quasiparticles at positions @xmath10, ...",
    ",@xmath11 , the result of the quasiparticle exchanges is more than just a change of the phase of the wavefunction . in that case",
    "an exchange of two quasiparticles can rotate one of the degenerate states , @xmath7 , into a different degenerate state @xmath12 within a @xmath6-dimensional degenerate hilbert space for @xmath9 quasiparticles , @xmath13 .",
    "in general , exchange of other two quasiparticles will be described by a different rotation matrix , @xmath14 . for two consecutive exchanges of the quasiparticles ,",
    "the final state of the system will depend upon the order in which these exchanges were performed , since the matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 do not commute , that is @xmath17 . such states and their quasiparticle excitations are therefore called non - abelian or non - commutative .",
    "this exotic non - abelian statistical behaviour allows fault - tolerant manipulation of the quantum information stored in @xmath6-dimensional hilbert space of @xmath9 non - abelian quasiparticles .",
    "quantum computation is a process of initializing a controllable quantum system to some known initial state @xmath18 , evolving system by a unitary transformation @xmath19 to some final state @xmath20 , and finally measuring the state @xmath20 at the end of the computation .",
    "the quantum computational code is defined by the unitary transformations , which can be engineered to be any unitary transformations if there is sufficient control over the underlying hamiltonian of the system .    for a large class of non - abelian states",
    "any unitary transformation can be generated only by braiding quasiparticles @xcite , which consequently allows universal topological quantum computation through braiding .",
    "an example of such non - abelian states are the states that support su(2)@xmath1 fibonacci anyon quasiparticle excitations @xcite .",
    "the final result of the computation , that is the final state of the system after evolution by a unitary transformation , can be obtained by a topological measurement based on a non - abelian generalization of the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "non - abelian states were initially predicted in fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems @xcite that are constrained to two spacial dimensions , and subsequently in various similar fqh - like systems in 2d @xcite .",
    "however , analogous states were also found to appear in various one - dimensional ( 1d ) models @xcite .    whether in 1d or 2d , non - abelian states of matter have a global hidden order with constituent particles following a global pattern that is not associated with breaking of any symmetry .",
    "this hidden order is associated with organization of particles in indistinguishable clusters @xcite .",
    "each cluster corresponds to an underlying abelian copy , and su(2)@xmath21 non - abelian states can be obtained from @xmath22 such abelian copies by symmetrizing over the coordinates of the clusters @xcite .",
    "this symmetrization ( indistinguishability ) can be achieved by applying a projection operator to a direct product of the wavefunctions for @xmath22 copies , which introduces the possibility of topological degeneracy and non - abelian statistics in the space of quasiparticles .",
    "the projection operator projects @xmath22 local degrees of freedom corresponding to @xmath22 copies onto a new degree of freedom that is symmetric under exchange of any of the @xmath22 components , and leads to a topological degeneracy not related to simple symmetry considerations .",
    "this topological degeneracy is robust against perturbations and interactions with the environment .    in our calculations we use exact diagonalization ( ed ) and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite methods to study low energy properties of the system for system",
    "sizes up to 50 lattice sites and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the region of the parameter space where the system supports non - abelian fibonacci anyon excitations is determined by calculating the overlaps between the exact wave functions for the low - energy states of the hamiltonian describing the system at average filling of @xmath2 atoms per lattice site , and the corresponding ansatz wavefunctions which have su(2)@xmath1 non - abelian order by construction .",
    "the ansatz states are constructed by applying a symmetrization projection operator to a direct product of the corresponding wave functions for three abelian copies at filling fraction @xmath23 atoms per lattice site .",
    "the projection operator introduces indistinguishability between the copies ( symmetrization over the coordinates of the clusters ) which leads to su(2)@xmath1 non - abelian order .",

    "<S> we study a system of dipolar bosons in a one - dimensional optical lattice using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods . in particular , we analyze low energy properties of the system at an average filling of 3/2 atoms per lattice site . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the region of the parameter space where the system has non - abelian fibonacci anyon excitations that correspond to fractional domain walls between different charge - density - waves . </S>",
    "<S> when such one - dimensional systems are combined into a two - dimensional network , braiding of fibonacci anyon excitations has potential application for fault tolerant , universal , topological quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to previous calculations , our results also demonstrate that super - solid phases are not present in the phase diagram for the discussed 3/2 average filling . </S>",
    "<S> instead , decreasing the value of the nearest - neighbor tunneling strength leads to a direct , berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless , super - fluid to charge - density - wave quantum phase transition . </S>"
