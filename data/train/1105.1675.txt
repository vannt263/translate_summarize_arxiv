    "groups appearing as lattices in the automorphism groups of cat(0)cube complexes have been a subject of considerable interest in recent years .",
    "on the one hand , the class of such groups include a broad spectrum of groups from across geometric group theory , including coxeter groups , right - angled artin groups , certain arithmetic lattices in real hyperbolic space , as well as small cancellation groups . on the other hand ,",
    "the combinatorial nature of cat(0)cube complexes allows one to develop techniques and results that are sharper than those that hold in the general context of cat(0)spaces .",
    "the present paper is devoted to developing aspects of boundary theory for lattices in cat(0)cube complexes , exhibiting useful analogies with boundary theory for lattices in semisimple lie groups .    to motivate this analogy , note that given a lattice subgroup of a connected semisimple lie group with finite center , or more generally any discrete subgroup , an important tool in understanding its properties is the study of its actions on various compact homogeneous spaces of the lie group , called boundary spaces .",
    "taking @xmath5 as an example , one considers the action of a subgroup on the maximal boundary , namely the space @xmath6 of full flags on @xmath7 , as well as on its equivariant factor spaces , the spaces of partial flags .",
    "generally , for any semisimple algebraic group @xmath8 , the maximal boundary of a semismple group @xmath8 is defined as the compact homogeneous space @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a minimal parabolic subgroup , and its factors are given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a parabolic subgroup containing @xmath10 . for a lattice subgroup ,",
    "the action on the maximal boundary is minimal and strongly proximal , and every generating probability measure on the lattice has a unique stationary measure .",
    "when the measure has finite logarithmic moment , the maximal boundary with the associated stationary measure constitutes a compact metric model of the poisson boundary .",
    "in addition the maximal boundary mean - proximal and universally amenable action of @xmath1 . for general discrete subgroups",
    "@xmath1 one can establish several of these properties ( or natural modifications thereof ) in considerable generality .",
    "we recall that some uses of the properties of the boundary action of discrete subgroups include    1 .   the tits alternative .",
    "2 .   simplicity and exactness of the reduced @xmath13-algebra .",
    "property @xmath14 , a - t - menability , baum - connes and novikov conjectures .",
    "4 .   patterson - sullivan theory . 5 .",
    "super - rigidity of measure - preserving actions of higher rank lattices . 6 .",
    "classification of boundary factors and normal subgroup theorem for higher rank lattices .",
    "the first step in the systematic development of boundary theory and its applications for cat(0)cube complexes and their uniform lattices is the construction of the right notion of maximal boundary , and this is our goal in the present paper .",
    "we note that for general cat(0)cube complexes there already exist two natural compactifications .",
    "first , one can consider the usual visual boundary defined for any cat(0)complex , and second , specifically for cube complexes , one can consider the space consisting of all the ultrafilters on the partially ordered set of half - spaces , an important compactification introduced by roller @xcite . in general , however , neither of these spaces give rise to minimal or proximal actions , and the same applies to the constructions discussed in @xcite and @xcite",
    ".    we will give a direct geometric construction of a boundary space , which in effect singles out a compact invariant subset @xmath2 of the roller boundary of a cube complex @xmath0 . the compact metric space @xmath2 plays a role analogous to the unique compact orbit @xmath9 of a semisimple lie group in the satake compactification .",
    "namely , @xmath2 is a limit set for the action of the lattice on the larger roller compactification , and gives rise to a minimal and strongly proximal action . for any generating measure on the lattice ,",
    "the action is uniquely stationary , and in addition it realizes the poisson boundary when the measure has finite logarithmic moment .",
    "@xmath2 is also is a mean proximal space for the group .",
    "we will identify a dense @xmath3 subset denoted @xmath4 contained in @xmath2 , on which the action is borel - amenable , and hence universal ( or measure - wise ) amenable .",
    "furthermore , @xmath4 has measure one with respect to any stationary measure as above .",
    "we will use @xmath4 to give a simple geometric proof that cube complexes satisfy yu s property @xmath14 in our context ( see @xcite for the general case ) .",
    "we note that @xmath2 possesses , for general cat(0)cube complexes , several further important structural features analogous to those of the maximal boundary of semisimple groups .",
    "in particular , utilizing the recent product decomposition theorem for cube complexes established in @xcite , the boundary @xmath2 can be represented as a canonical product @xmath15 where each @xmath16 is an essential , irreducible non - euclidean cube complex , with the action on @xmath2 being the direct product of the action of @xmath1 on @xmath17 .",
    "the invariant @xmath18 appearing here will be called the split rank of the cube complex .",
    "it is the natural generalization of the split rank associated with a semisimple algebraic group over a local field , in the case that its bruhat - tits building is a product of trees , or equivalently , in the case it has no simple factor groups of split rank at least two . in particular our construction yields",

    "since an @xmath20-cube is a product of @xmath20 unit intervals , each @xmath20-cube comes equipped with @xmath20 natural projection maps to the unit interval .",
    "a _ hypercube _ is the preimage of @xmath24 under one of these projections ; each @xmath20-cube contains @xmath20 hypercubes .",

    "every collection of pairwise crossing hyperplanes has a non - empty intersection .",
    "each hyperplane is itself a cat(0)cube complex .",
    "we shall use the @xmath25 metric on @xmath0 , namely simply the metric on the vertices which assigns to two vertices the number of hyperplanes separating them .",
    "this metric is equivalent to the path metric on the 1-skeleton of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the collection of halfspaces and @xmath27 denote the collection of hyperplanes .",
    "the collection of halfspaces comes equipped with a natural involution @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the two complementary components of a given hyperplane .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the hyperplane associated to the halfspace @xmath29 .",
    "recall that an _ ultrafilter _ on @xmath26 is a subset @xmath32 of @xmath26 satisfying the following two conditions :    1 .   * choice . * for every hyperplane @xmath31 , either @xmath33 or @xmath34 but not both . 2 .   * consistency . *",
    "if @xmath33 and @xmath35 , then @xmath36 .    sometimes we will want to construct an ultrafilter and this will be done by making a consistent choice of halfspaces .",
    "this means choosing halfspaces of @xmath26 according to @xmath37 and @xmath38 above .",
    "given two ultrafilters @xmath32 and @xmath39 and a hyperplane @xmath31 , we say that @xmath32 and @xmath39 are _ separated _ by @xmath31 if @xmath33 and @xmath40 or @xmath41 and @xmath34 .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 the collection of all ultrafilters on the collection of halfspaces @xmath26 of @xmath0 .",

    "we will use @xmath49 to denote the ultrafilter associated to @xmath50 . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "when @xmath0 is finite dimensional , such ultrafilters are characterized by the descending chain condition ( dcc ) , namely every descending chain of halfspaces @xmath51 terminates .",
    "such ultrafilters are called _ principal _ ultrafilters .    following roller",
    ", we may view @xmath44 as a compactification of @xmath43 in the following simple manner .",
    "we consider the product :    @xmath52    since an ultrafilter is a choice for each pair @xmath53 , we have that @xmath54 .",
    "the space @xmath55 endowed with the tychonoff topology is a compact space .",
    "it is not difficult to see then that @xmath44 is a closed subset of @xmath55 and is therefore compact .",
    "moreover , roller shows that @xmath43 is open and dense in @xmath44 .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath56 constitutes a compactification of @xmath43 , which we refer to as the roller boundary .    to develop a better understanding of what @xmath57 looks like , it is useful to recall how one metrizes the product topology . recall that if @xmath58 is a countable product of metric spaces of uniformly bounded diameter , we may metrize the product topology as follows .",
    "let @xmath59 be any decreasing positive function such that @xmath60 .",
    "then given @xmath61 , we set    @xmath62    in our setting , the space @xmath63 is a countable product of two element spaces , each containing the two hafspaces associated to a given hyperplane .",
    "we simply need to describe a function @xmath64 as above .",
    "when @xmath0 is proper , one can order the hyperplanes using the metric on @xmath0 . pick a base vertex @xmath65 . for any hyperplane @xmath31 , we let @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes the 1-skeleton distance between @xmath68 and @xmath31 . that is ,    @xmath69    since there are only finitely many hyperplanes a given distance from @xmath68 , we have that @xmath70 is a decreasing function approaching @xmath22 , as required .",
    "explicitly , we have for two distinct ultrafilters @xmath71    @xmath72    note also that for each halfspace @xmath29 we can define the following subset of @xmath44 :    @xmath73    we refer to such a subset as an @xmath44-halfspace .",
    "the collection of all @xmath44-halfspaces forms a sub - basis for the tychonoff topology on @xmath44 .",
    "thus a basic open set consists of the intersection of finitely many @xmath44-halfspaces .",
    "one can abstract the above construction in the following way .",

    "a pair of elements of @xmath80 are said to be transverse if @xmath14 and @xmath81 are incomparable with @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the pocset @xmath74 is said to have _ finite width _ if there is a universal bound on the size of a collection of incomparable elements .",
    "if one starts with a finite dimensional cube complex , the collection of halfspaces forms a pocset which satisfies both the finite width condition and the finite interval condition .",
    "given any poset @xmath74 with an order - reversing involution , one can consider the collection of all ultrafilters @xmath84 on @xmath74 as in subsection [ ultrafilters ] . if @xmath74 satisfies the finite interval condition and has finite width , then the collection of all principal ultrafilters is the vertex set of a finite dimensional cat(0)cube complex @xmath85 .",
    "as noted by roller , this construction is natural in that if one starts with a cat(0)cube complex @xmath0 , considers its pocset of haflspaces @xmath86 and then considers the cube complex whose vertices are the principal ultrafilters on @xmath74 , then @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the halfspaces of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath89 is a subset of @xmath26 closed under involution .",
    "we can consider the ultrafilters on the halfspace system @xmath90 , which we denote @xmath91 .",
    "the collection of principal ultrafilters of @xmath91 is the vertex set of a cat(0)cube complex @xmath92 .",
    "there is then a natural projection map .",
    "@xmath93 @xmath94    this projection restricts to a projection on the principal ultrafilters , so that one has a projection map @xmath95 .",
    "[ quotient ] let @xmath0 be finite dimensional cat(0)cube complex",
    ". then the natural projection @xmath95 is surjective .",
    "we need to show that given a consistent choice of half spaces for @xmath90 satisfying dcc , it can be extended to a consistent choice of halfspaces for half spaces in @xmath26 satisfying dcc .",
    "we do this by induction on the dimension on the dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "so let @xmath32 be a principal ultrafilter on @xmath90 .",

    "we now proceed by induction . again letting @xmath32",
    "be a principal ultrafilter on @xmath90 , we choose a minimal halfspace @xmath98 .",
    "now the hyperplanes of @xmath99 are divided into those that meet @xmath100 and those that do not .",
    "we focus first on those that meet @xmath100 .",
    "these correspond to hyperplanes in @xmath100 , viewed as a cat(0)cube complex in its own right . by induction , for the collection of halfspaces associated to these hyperplanes ,",
    "we have that there exists some vertex @xmath101 for which    @xmath102    we now let @xmath97 be the edge of @xmath0 whose midpoint is @xmath50 and let @xmath103 be the endpoint of @xmath97 which is contained in @xmath104",
    ". then @xmath105 is our desired ultrafilter .",
    "we then have the following useful corollary .    [ nontrivialintersection ]",

    "then @xmath90 is an involution invariant subset and we may construct the space @xmath109 .",
    "the subset @xmath32 is now an ultrafilter on @xmath90 and since it satisfies dcc , it corresponds to a vertex in @xmath109 .",
    "now by lemma [ quotient ] the map @xmath95 is surjective , so there exist vertices of @xmath0 mapping to @xmath32 .",
    "these vertices lie in @xmath110 as required .",
    "a particular example of this type of projection occurs when one eliminates a single hyperplane : @xmath111 . in @xmath0 , the collection of all cubes intersecting @xmath31",
    "is called the _ carrier _ of @xmath31 , which we denote @xmath112 , and naturally has a product structure @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "one then has a natural collapsing map @xmath113\\to { { \\hat{{{\\mathfrak h}}}}}\\times \\{0\\}$ ] .",
    "one can apply this to the carrier of @xmath31 to obtain a quotient @xmath114 of @xmath0 , whose hyperplanes are @xmath115 .",
    "this quotient space @xmath114 is the cube complex associated to the pocset @xmath116 . in this instance",

    "we also use the term collapsing for the quotient obtained by removing finitely many halfspaces .",
    "when a group acts on a tree , it is useful to pass to a minimal invariant subtree . for a cat(0)cube complex , there is a similar process , described in @xcite , which we now describe .",

    "a hyperplane is called _ essential _ if both of its associated halfspaces are deep .",
    "a cube complex is called _ essential _ if all of its hyperplanes are essential .",
    "we then have a the following result ( described in more detail in @xcite )    let @xmath0 be a cat(0)cube complex with cocompact automorphism group . then there exists a canonical essential cat(0)cube complex @xmath118 and a @xmath1-equivariant map @xmath119 such that    * the preimage under @xmath70 of the collection of hyperplanes of @xmath118 is the collection of essential hyperplanes of @xmath0 * @xmath70 is bounded - to - one .",
    "* remark . *",
    "a natural subclass of cat(0)cube complexes is the collection of those which have _ extendible geodesics _ , which means that every finite geodesic path can be extended to a bi - infinite geodesic .",

    ", we will pass to this essential quotient and work with it .",
    "as was discussed in @xcite , a decomposition of @xmath0 as a product @xmath122 corresponds to a decomposition of @xmath27 as a disjoint union @xmath123 where every hyperplane in @xmath124 intersects every hyperplane in @xmath125 .",
    "a cat(0)cube complex is called _ irreducible _ if it does not decompose as a product .",
    "we recall the following theorem , proved in @xcite .",
    "every finite dimensional cat(0)cube complex admits a canonical ( up to permutation of factors ) decomposition as a finite product of irreducible cat(0)cube complexes .",
    "we note that the canonical property of this decomposition is that up to passing to a subgroup of finite index , @xmath126 preserves the decomposition .",
    "we now simply observe that an ultrafilter on @xmath0 gives rise ( by restriction ) to an ultrafilter on each of the irreducible factors .",
    "conversely , a choice of an ultrafilter on each factor gives us an ultrafilter on @xmath0 .",
    "thus , if @xmath127 is the canonical product decomposition of @xmath0 , we have an identification @xmath128 .",
    "an unbounded cocompact cat(0)cube complex is called _ euclidean _ if it contains an @xmath126-invariant flat , otherwise it is called _ non - euclidean_. only the non - euclidean factors will play an important role in the description of the boundary .",
    "it is thus useful to separate all the euclidean factors from all the non - euclidean ones .",
    "we summarize this section as follows .",

    "part ( 1 ) of the corollary tells us that if we are considering proper cocompact actions on cat(0)cube complexes , we may pass to actions on essential cube complexes .",
