    "the lee - wick field theories @xcite originated in an attempt to address the problem related with the infinities in quantum field theories .",
    "recently some authors have tried to implement lee - wick s idea in a higher derivative version of a quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "all these theories assumed the existence of some partners of the standard model particles .",
    "the main ideas of the lee - wick standard model in ref .",
    "@xcite have been extended in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors use two lee - wick partners for each standard model field : one with negative and the other with positive norm .",
    "later , this idea has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to improve gauge coupling unification without introducing additional fields in the higher - derivative theory .",
    "the higgs sector of the lee - wick standard model has also been constrained in ref .",
    ".    there has been at least one attempt @xcite to use the concepts of these lee - wick constructions in cosmology where the authors were able to show the bouncing nature of the universe whose energy is dominated by the energies of a scalar field and its lee - wick partner . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors tried to formulate a possible thermodynamic theory of particles which includes the lee - wick partners using a method of statistical field theory previously formulated by dashen , ma and bernstein in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present article mainly focusses on a variant of the original lee - wick idea , which was concerned about the taming of the divergences in a quantum field theory . in 1984",
    "boulware and gross @xcite tried to show that the original proposal of lee and wick was related to a complex implementation of the pauli - villars regularization scheme @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the idea arises from the fact that the pauli - villars regulator fields in the lee - wick theories are not just ad hoc regulator fields , they also have dynamics . to implement the pauli - villars idea lee and wick introduced massive partner fields for all the normal fields in the theory .",
    "the scheme becomes involved when one tries to quantize the partner fields .",
    "it turns out that the partner fields can be quantized in two ways . in one way",
    "the norm of the states of the partner fields on the underlying hilbert space remains definite and in the other case the norm of the states of the partner fields on the hilbert space becomes indefinite . in the former case",
    "the energy of the lee - wick partner fields turns out to be negative and in the later case the energy of the lee - wick partner fields remain positive .",
    "both the options , as stated above , have their merits and demerits . in the first option , where the partner field states have positive definite norms but negative energy ,",
    "the theory remains quantum mechanically understandable but does not have a proper ground state .",
    "there are run - away solutions . in the other option , where the lee - wick partner field states live on an indefinite metric hilbert space but",
    "carry positive energy , there are zero - norm states which can grow indefinitely .",
    "this option also gives rise to run - away solutions .",
    "historically lee and wick preferred to work with the theory defined on an indefinite metric .",
    "the difficulties of the run - away solutions were addressed by applying future boundary conditions which again made the theory non - causal .    the present article deals with the option which lee and wick discarded , a quantum field theory of lee - wick fields whose states do live on a definite metric hilbert space but has negative energy .",
    "the motivation for such an unconventional work comes from a very interesting result related to the thermodynamics of the standard lee - wick theory as given in ref .",
    "it turns out that the thermodynamics of the indefinite metric , positive energy lee - wick partners is exactly the same as definite metric but negative energy lee - wick fields .",
    "this similarity of the thermodynamics of the two different scenarios gives us a glimpse of the path which lee and wick did not take historically .",
    "there are a plethora of problems related with the option which is presented in this article , the most important of them being that the theory is energetically unstable .",
    "presently we do not give all the pathological properties of the alternative lee - wick prescription , nor do we know the cures of all the formal ( pathological ) diseases of the theory .",
    "the formal aspects of the negative energy lee - wick sector remains mostly open for further investigation in the near future .",
    "inspite of all the conceptual difficulties related to run - away solutions the result presented is too strong to be taken as a coincidence .",
    "interestingly , the energy instability of the model plays an important role in the thermodynamics of the unusual fields and indirectly affects the results presented in this article which match surprisingly with the thermodynamics of the positive energy lee - wick fields .",
    "readers who are purely interested in the formal aspects of the alternative lee - wick prescription can go through ref .",
    "@xcite for a more lucid and formal development of the basic ideas .",
    "the present article is presented in the following manner .",
    "a brief introduction on the unusual regulator fields and their properties is presented in the next section .",
    "section [ distrb : s ] discusses the technique to find out the thermal distribution function of the regulator fields . in section [ eps ] the energy density , pressure and entropy density of a gas comprising of elementary particles and their unusual field partners are calculated using the thermal distribution functions . the last section [ conc ] summarizes the important results obtained in this article .",
    "in the paper written by grinstein , oconnell and wise , @xcite on lee - wick standard model , the authors proposed a higher derivative field theory as the underlying theory of nature .",
    "the quadratic kinetic terms of the normal field theories , both bosonic and fermionic , are regained by introducing new degrees of freedom .",
    "it turns out that the lagrangians of the new fields have wrong signs . in their work grinstein , oconnell and wise",
    "@xcite did not give any prescription for the canonical quantization of the new fields .",
    "in a later work by fornal , grinstein and wise @xcite the authors derived the thermodynamics of the unusual new degrees of freedom using methods of statistical field theory . in this section",
    "we first canonically quantize these new partner fields .",
    "this exercise will immediately show that these fields do carry positive energy . in the next step",
    "we give the prescription for obtaining negative energy fields in the lee - wick paradigm .",
    "we do the quantization for the scalar field with the understanding that the other bosons in the theory do follow the same quantization rules .",

    "the equation above predicts that the field excitations of the partner fields will have indefinite norm in the hilbert space .",
    "the unusual commutation relation between the creation and annihilation operators of the @xmath0 field excitations is related to the negative sign of the canonically conjugate momentum corresponding to the @xmath0 field .",

    "the important point to note is the negative sign in the definition of the the number operator . in this case",
    "if we stick to the conventional definition of the number operator ( the same operator without the negative sign ) then it can be shown that it will have negative eigenvalues .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 has a positive spectrum .",
    "this unconventional behavior of the number operator originates from the unconventional commutation relation of the creation and annihilation operators of the field excitations as given in eq .",
    "( [ nquanta ] ) .",
    "the negative sign of the original lagrangian of the @xmath0 field is balanced by the negative sign of the number operator and consequently the hamiltonian of the field turns out to be positive .",

    "<S> it was pointed out some time ago that there can be two variations in which the divergences of a quantum field theory can be tamed using the ideas presented by lee and wick . in one variation </S>",
    "<S> the lee - wick partners of the normal fields live in an indefinite metric hilbert space but have positive energy and in the other variation the lee - wick partners can live in a normal hilbert space but carry negative energy . </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanically the two variations mainly differ in the way the fields are quantized . in this article </S>",
