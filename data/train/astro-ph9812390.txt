    "ngc  2841 is a regular early - type spiral galaxy , rather isolated , without any morphological signs of past interaction .",
    "it has a weak liner nucleus ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a flocculent spiral structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have investigated the innermost part of the galaxy inside @xmath9 with the multi - pupil field spectrograph of the 6 m telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar nucleus of ngc  2841 was found to be chemically decoupled , being more metal rich than surrounding bulge by a factor of 2.3 ; moreover , nuclear ionized gas demonstrated rotation in the plane strictly orthogonal to the global galactic plane ( and to the rotation plane of stars in the center of the galaxy too ) .",
    "it looks like a small gaseous polar ring .",
    "global polar rings are usually treated as signatures of past interaction with gas accretion or even of a minor merger .",
    "but such an event can not affect only the very center of the galaxy ; there must be any peculiarities in the global structure .",
    "we have found some hints on the presence of a dynamically decoupled stellar component in the bulge of ngc  2841 ( @xcite ) ; but a further investigation of the global structure and kinematics of the galaxy was needed to understand what we see here .",
    "ngc  2841 is known to possess a quite regular structure .",
    "the only claim about its peculiarity was result of varela et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that the bulge of ngc  2841 is a triaxial ellipsoid with varying axis ratio .",
    "starting from the pioneer work of zaritsky &  lo ( @xcite ) , a triaxial bulge in a spiral galaxy is usually detected by a turn of isophote major axis at the galactic center .",
    "but the isophote major axis turn in ngc  2841 , which causes varela et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to claim a presence of the triaxial bulge , is quite small , only 10  according to their measurements ( @xmath10 for the bulge and @xmath11 for the disk ) .",
    "if we take into account a lot of other independent determinations of the line - of - nodes orientation in ngc  2841 ( photometry : @xmath12=147 , rc3 , @xcite , @xmath12=150 , @xcite ; neutral hydrogen kinematics : @xmath12=150 , @xcite ) , this value may be even smaller , 4 - 7 , and then is comparable with the measurement errors . besides , the orientation of the isophote major axis @xmath13=154 , which is ascribed to the triaxial bulge by varela et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , is observed only in the radius range of 2040 ; closer to the center the @xmath13 value falls to the outermost level , @xmath13=147 , and varela et al .",
    "are forced to suggest a presence of another inner bar aligned with the line of nodes to explain a behaviour of isophote position angle dependence on the radius .",
    "the structure begins to look too complex for such a small position angle variation .",
    "so , the question of triaxial bulge presence in ngc  2841 must be regarded more carefully by involving kinematical data for gas and stars in the central region dominating by the bulge potential .",
    "our paper treats just this problem .",
    "a description of observational data used for the analysis is presented in sec .  2 .",
    "the kinematical results are discussed in sec .  3 , and the morphological results  in sec .",
    "4 . finally , in sec .  5",
    "we briefly discuss some details and conclude with a summary of our study .",
    "the data which we analyse in this work include long - slit spectra taken almost along the major axis of ngc  2841 , broad - band @xmath0 panoramic photometry and narrow - band images obtained through the scanning fabry - perot interferometer in combination with interference filters centered on the redshifted emission lines @xmath1 and [ nii]@xmath146583 .",
    "we have used facilities of the la palma archive as well as our own observations made at the 6 m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory ( nizhnij arkhyz , russia ) .",
    "spectral data were obtained on january 6 and 7 , 1991 , at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope on la palma with the isis , red arm , equipped by a ccd @xmath15 .",
    "two spectral ranges were exposed , 58306680   included the strongest emission lines @xmath1 and [ nii]@xmath146583 and 80008840   included the strongest stellar absorption lines @xmath148498 , 8542 , 8662 .",
    "the dispersion was 0.74    per pixel which corresponds to the spectral resolution of 2   , the slit width was @xmath16 , and a scale along the slit was @xmath17 per pixel .",
    "the galaxy was exposed in two position angles , @xmath18 and 153 , both close to the major axis .",
    "exposure times were set equal to 1 hour , except the exposure in @xmath19 , 58306680  , which was of 40 min .",
    "copper - neon and copper - argon comparison lamps were used for wavelength calibration ; a check by measuring night - sky emission lines has shown that the inner accuracy of a single velocity measurement inside one spectrum frame is not worse than 2 km / s , though a systematic shift of the whole frame by 1030 km / s is possible between neighboring exposures .",
    "two bright stars , hr  3125 ( k1iii ) and hr  3222 ( g8iii ) , were used as templates for a cross - correlation in the spectral range of 8000 - 8840 to obtain stellar velocities along the major axis of ngc  2841 .",
    "the photometric data were obtained on may 6 , 1988 , at the 1 m jacobus kapteyn telescope on la palma with ccd @xmath20 , through the broad - band filters @xmath0 .",
    "a spatial scale was @xmath21 per pixel , so only the central part of the galaxy was exposed ; the seeing quality ( @xmath22 ) was @xmath23@xmath24 .",
    "the exposure times were 300 + 300 sec ( @xmath25 ) , 300 + 200 sec ( @xmath26 ) , and 200 + 200 sec ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "no photometric standards were observed , so we have not made any attempts to calibrate these ccd frames .",
    "instead we have made an isophotal analysis deriving radial dependencies of the major - axis position angle , isophote ellipticity , and boxiness .    at the 6 m telescope",
    "we have observed ngc  2841 with the scanning fabry - perot interferometer ( @xcite ) twice : in december 1996 in the emission line @xmath1 and in may 1997 in the emission line [ nii]@xmath146583 .",
    "the observations were undertaken in the frame of the project of prof .",
    "a. m. fridman dedicated to a search of large - scale vortices in gas velocity fields of spiral galaxies . here",
    "we present only narrow - band images of ngc  2841 in @xmath1 and [ nii ] emission lines obtained as by - products of these observations .",
    "a ccd detector with format of @xmath28 was used with a binning of @xmath29 ; a resulting scale of @xmath30 per pixel after binning @xmath29 allowed to register an area of @xmath31 .",
    "the seeing quality was @xmath32 in december 1996 and @xmath33 in may 1997 .",
    "all the observational data were reduced by using the software developed in the special astrophysical observatory ( @xcite ) and the software adhoc developed in the marseille observatory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the long - slit spectra obtained in the spectral range of 58306680   reveal a presence of quite measurable emission lines @xmath1 and [ nii ] in the full radius range of 02covered by the observations .",
    "inside @xmath34 the nitrogen emission line @xmath146583 is almost everywhere stronger than @xmath1 implying a shock excitation mechanism ; sometimes the emission lines are clearly splitting with a velocity separation of the components up to 150 km / s .",
    "we have measured gas line - of - sight velocities along the slit by searching for line baricenters and by applying a gauss analysis to the multi - component profiles ; the complete results are presented in fig .  1 , and the results for the central part are presented in fig .",
    "2 . outside @xmath35 the measured velocity distributions are quite regular , the rotation curve looks flat , in accordance with numerous previous investigations , at the level of @xmath36 km / s assuming after whitmore et al .",
    "( @xcite ) galaxy inclination to be 65 . in the inner part of ngc  2841 , particularly inside",
    "@xmath37 , the behaviour of the gas line - of - sight velocities is so complex that we can not explain all the details of the velocity profiles .",
    "but some typical features of the distributions can be interpreted as evidences for a bar - like potential .",
    "first of all , though the cross - sections in @xmath18 and in @xmath19 are positioned very tightly , fig .",
    "2a and fig .",
    "2b look quite different .",
    "it means that the structure in the center of ngc  2841 which causes the emission line splitting is very subtle , almost one - dimensional . though the global disk of ngc  2841 is moderately inclined to the line of sight , by some 6065  ( varela et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , it seems that we see a bar aligned with the line of nodes through the rotating gaseous disk . in @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "2a ) we can note two straight segments of the velocity distributions separated by 150180 km / s in the same radius range , namely , 1020  to the north from the center .",
    "it looks like a simultaneous registration of a fast - rotating gaseous disk and of a slow - rotating bar edge which is traced by gas radiating in a shock wave .",
    "a similar emission - line splitting has been predicted in the dynamical work of kuijken and merrifield ( @xcite ) who have considered visible effect of edge - on bars on major - axis line - of - sight velocity profiles . in @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "2b ) two straight segments have an opposite slope and are located in the radius ranges of 010  to the south and 1020to the north from the center . this configuration with a visible velocity break in the center of the symmetry",
    "can be understood if we remind that there exists a radius range ( usually between two ilrs ) where any bar provokes a predominance of gas orbits elongated orthogonally to this bar ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "the orbits highly elongated along the line of sight ( seen `` end - on '' ) would provide just the configuration similar to that in fig .",
    "solely , a position of the velocity distribution symmetry center in this configuration must be shifted by 5  to the north from the photometric center .",
    "but it is quite possible : in our previous investigation ( @xcite ) made with the panoramic spectrograph providing a two - dimensional velocity field we have already obtained a position of the symmetry center of the gas velocity field shifted to the north with respect to the brightness center position .",
    "we have derived stellar line - of - sight velocities by cross - correlating sky- and continuum - subtracted near - infrared galactic spectra line - by - line with the spectra of the template stars observed the same night .",
    "an example of the cross - correlation peaks is presented in fig .",
    "3 . in the full radius range where the cross - correlation peaks are measurable",
    " from 45  to the south from the nucleus toward 100  to the north  they demonstrate a multi - component structure .",
    "velocity differences between the components are sufficiently large so extraction of the components is a procedure easy enough . we have used a gauss analysis for this purpose .",
    "curiously , as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "3a , to the south from the nucleus the intermediate - velocity component is the strongest one , and to the north from the nucleus , at @xmath38 , the extremely blueshifted component becomes the most prominent .",
    "this asymmetry is the first sign of a triaxial bulge .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to trace stellar velocity distributions toward the center of ngc  2841 : inside @xmath39 stellar velocity dispersion strongly increases ( or additional kinematical components arise ? ) , and an unambiguous component separation becomes impossible . beyond @xmath39",
    "all the cross - correlation peaks can be decomposed mainly into three components ; the corresponding three kinematical subsystems are presented in fig .",
    "attached error bars characterize differences between velocity determinations by using two different template stars .    unlike the gaseous velocity distributions in fig .  1 , the stellar velocity distributions in two different position angles , 145and 153 , are quite identical . in fig .  4 we see three stellar kinematical subsystems  two prograde and one retrograde",
    ". among two prograde subsystems ,",
    "one rotates by a factor of 3 faster than another .",
    "the rotation velocities of the slow - rotating prograde system and of the retrograde system are comparable .",
    "we have called these three subsystems `` direct bulge '' , `` disk '' , and `` retrograde bulge '' .",
    "the rotation velocity of the disk is practically equal to the rotation velocity of the gaseous disk , so we conclude that it is a dynamically cold stellar subsystem .",
    "the semi - amplitudes of velocity variations for the both `` bulges '' are of order of 100 km / s ; and we can not prove that the rotation of these components is circular . in the context of a triaxial bulge hypothesis an existence of two `` bulge '' kinematical subsystems",
    "is easily explained if the bulge is triaxial , seen edge - on , and slightly tumbling ; in this case we see streaming stellar motions along the bar simultaneously in both directions .",
    "figure  5 presents isophotes of the surface brightness distributions in the emission lines @xmath1 ( a ) and [ nii]@xmath146583 ( b ) for the very center of ngc  2841 @xmath40 .",
    "earlier we have already constructed an analogous map in [ nii ] by using the observational data obtained with the multi - pupil field spectrograph of the 6 m telescope ( @xcite ) ; an agreement of the fig .",
    "5b presented here with the fig .  11 in the previous work ( @xcite ) is perfect even in details : again we see that the overall intensity distribution is aligned with the line of nodes ( @xmath41 ) , again we can notice an extra - component to the north from the nucleus aligned in @xmath42 , and even splitting southern `` tail '' of the surface brightness distribution is exactly reproduced .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath1 image of the center of ngc  2841 ( fig .",
    "5a ) has appeared to be quite different : it is much more symmetric than the [ nii]@xmath146583 image though it demonstrates also some small peculiarities , such as concaves of the outer isophote at the @xmath43 ( dust lane ? ) .",
    "a lack of resemblance between the two images promises something interesting if mapping [ nii]-to-@xmath1 emission line ratio .",
    "figure  6 presents a full - format map of [ nii]@xmath146583 to @xmath1 flux ratio with superimposed isophotes of the @xmath1 image .",
    "the map is normalized to the value [ nii]/@xmath1=2 in the nucleus which was obtained from the la palma long - slit spectra .",
    "first of all , we can notice that in the spiral arms which are clearly sketched by the @xmath1 emission maxima the [ nii ] to @xmath1 ratio falls below 0.5 .",
    "it is consistent with an excitation of the ionized gas by hot massive stars .",
    "but besides the spiral arms , which are distinct by the low [ nii]-to-@xmath1 ratio , there are also two long , slightly curved loci , which are distinct by a high [ nii]-to-@xmath1 ratio .",
    "these features are located in the radius range of 3050 ; their [ nii]/@xmath1 values between 3 and 4 allow to regard them as shock wave fronts .",
    "their morphology resembles that of dust lanes which are often seen on the edges of bars and which are also related to shock wave fronts .",
    "another evidence for a shock origin of the high [ nii]/@xmath1 ratio regions is presented in fig .",
    "the slit at the position angle @xmath19 crossed the southern feature at @xmath44 and @xmath35 .",
    "figure  7 shows a corresponding piece of the gas velocity curve . the nitrogen emission line in the radius range of @xmath45 has a double - peaked profile .",
    "we have fitted it by two gaussians ; one of them has given velocities corresponding to the regularly rotating disk , the second  the velocities smaller by some 100 km / s .",
    "this velocity splitting is a sure signature of shock waves .",
    "a detailed surface photometry through the broad - band filters was already performed for ngc  2841 by varela et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "they have used ccd observations from the 4.2 m wh telescope of la palma taken under good seeing conditions .",
    "the data presented here are obtained at the much smaller telescope , but also under very good seeing conditions , so the quality of our morphological results has appeared to be not worse than in their work .",
    "figure  8 presents radial dependencies of isophote major axis position angle , of isophote ellipticity , and of the fourth fourier coefficient @xmath7 called `` boxiness '' .",
    "the former two dependencies at @xmath46 agree perfectly with the results of varela et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; the boxiness was not analysed by them .",
    "the major axis position angle shows small variations over the full radius range under consideration ; the central increase of @xmath13 toward 156must be real because of agreement with the results of our analysis of hst / wfpc image for ngc  2841 ( @xcite ) .",
    "besides the @xmath13 increase in the very center , we have also a plateau of @xmath13 in the radius range of 1335  at the level of @xmath47 ; outside this radius range the isophotes are aligned with the line of nodes .",
    "varela et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have obtained the same plateau in the same radius range and have interpreted it as a signature of bulge triaxiality .",
    "we agree because the same radius range is distinguished in fig .",
    "8c by strongly negative @xmath7 values in the all three filters .",
    "it is quite consistent with a picture of the large - scale bar seen edge - on implied by the kinematics ( see the previous section ) , because numerical studies of orbit instabilities have shown that barred galaxies must have boxy bulges ( e. g. @xcite ) . inside @xmath48",
    "the situation is not so clear : the major axis position angle coincides with that of the line of nodes , and @xmath7 is only mildly negative .",
    "varela et al . ( @xcite ) suggested the second , inner bar , but for this hypothesis there are no arguments : their reference to keel ( @xcite ) is erroneous , because keel ( @xcite ) claimed a one - sided gaseous bar in the center of ngc  2841 , not a two - sided stellar one .",
    "perhaps it would be more correct to classify a zone of @xmath26=412  as a transition from a slightly warped nuclear disk with a radius of 2  to the ( possibly torus - like ? ) triaxial bulge .",
    "a behaviour of the isophote ellipticity ( fig .",
    "8b ) demonstrates characteristic oscillations which may result from the presence of two radially limited oblate components .",
    "the information which we have obtained on the kinematics of gas and stars in ngc  2841 is rich and somewhat unexpected .",
    "the ionized - gas emission lines are doubling mainly inside @xmath49 ; but the stellar losvd is multi - component up to @xmath50 ! the stellar rotation inside @xmath51 in ngc  2841 was once investigated by whitmore et al .",
    "( @xcite ) : two long - slit cross - sections , along @xmath52 and along @xmath53 , were obtained under a spectral resolution of 3.4  , that is twice worse than ours , and no subsystem multiplicity were noticed . as for gas rotation in this region whitmore et al .",
    "( @xcite ) said , with the reference to rubin and thonnard ( private communication ) , that the innermost measurable emission was detected at @xmath54 , and for the inner disk the rotation curve was extrapolated from this point to the center .",
    "the mean major - axis stellar velocity distribution of whitmore et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed a prominent minimum at @xmath55 ; the velocity decrease was measured to be steeper that a keplerian one , and whitmore et al .",
    "( @xcite ) accepted a triaxiality of the bulge .",
    "the bulge rotation velocity projected on the line of sight was estimated by them ( after subtracting the extrapolated disk ) as @xmath56 km / s .",
    "this estimate seems to be quite reasonable : by the direct subsystem decomposition we have measured @xmath57=106 km / s for the `` direct '' bulge and 76 km / s for the `` retrograde '' bulge .",
    "here we must mention that our direct measurement of the bulge rotation curve is not unique .",
    "for example , wagner et al .",
    "( @xcite ) had presented two parallel rotation curves for the disk and bulge of ngc  4594 up to @xmath51 ; they have noticed that correlation peaks were doubling and , trying to decompose them with a lot of precautions , they have obtained two stellar subsystems , both cold enough , one of which rotated with the velocity of @xmath58 300 km / s , and the other ",
    "slower by 120 km / s .",
    "the words `` disk '' and `` bulge '' were pronounced in their discussion .",
    "but in ngc  4594 there were no any `` counterrotating '' subsystem which is seen , as third by its luminosity , in ngc  2841 .",
    "a counterrotating subsystem was reported to be found in another early - type spiral galaxy , ngc  7217 , by merrifield & kuijken ( @xcite ) .",
    "they have measured a double - peaked losvd and have claimed a discovery of two counterrotating stellar disks in ngc  7217 ; they argued that outside @xmath9 a bulge contribution in this galaxy is negligible and can not affect the measured stellar kinematics .",
    "but their photometric arguments were wrong : buta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have decomposed a high - quality surface brightness profile of ngc  7217 and have found that a de vaucouleurs bulge dominates in this galaxy over the whole radius range .",
    "so perhaps in ngc  7217 merrifield & kuijken ( @xcite ) saw just the same `` prograde '' and `` retrograde '' bulges as we have seen in ngc  2841 .",
    "searching for a cause of multi - ring structure in ngc  7217 , buta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have also detected a slight triaxiality of the galaxy bulge ; it implies that the hypothesis of elliptical stellar streams may be a quite reasonable explanation of what merrifield & kuijken ( @xcite ) saw in ngc  7217 .",
    "if we summarize the results of this work and those of our first paper ( @xcite ) on ngc  2841 , we obtain a curious list of kinematical and morphological features which must be jointed in the frame of one hypothesis .",
    "all of them are schematically shown in fig .",
    "these are :    * the most prominent photometric appearance of a bar in the radius range of 1533 ; * a presence of strong shocks on the trailing sides of the photometric bar in the radius range of 3050 ; * in the radius range of 515  gas is on orbits in the galactic plane but elongated orthogonally to the bar ; * inside @xmath59 gas rotates in the plane orthogonal to the galactic plane ( @xcite ) ; * the visible center of gas rotation is shifted by 35  to the north along the major axis with respect to the brightness center ( @xcite , this paper ) ; * star motions in the radius range of 410have a significant line - of - sight velocity component along the galaxy minor axis  either a polar ring or elongated plane orbits orthogonal to the bar ( @xcite ) ; * in the radius range of 10100  we see two `` counterrotating '' stellar bulges , moreover , to the north - west from the center we see them both through the stellar disk ",
    "the picture is consistent with elliptical streaming of stars along the photometric ( but much shorter ! ) bar .    during the last two decades",
    "there were a lot of papers on gas response to an ovally distorted potential .",
    "though the results seem to be model dependent , however some things are firmly established . we know , for example , that shocks at the trailing edges of a bar are a signature of the low contrast of the oval potential distortion ( @xcite ) and that plane orthogonal orbit family dominates inside ilr ( e. g. @xcite )",
    ". the most prominent theoretic bar manifestation in the gaseous disk must be perhaps two - armed spiral pattern  global density waves .",
    "though ngc  2841 is a flocculent spiral galaxy , recently two smooth ( grand - design ? ) spiral arms have been detected by block et al .",
    "( @xcite ) on the @xmath60 ( 2.1@xmath61 m ) image of this galaxy .",
    "the arms look dark ; block et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suppose that they are density waves in the dust - gaseous disk of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , these arms are just what must accompany the global bar which we report in this paper .",
    "interestingly , ngc  2841 is not the only flocculent galaxy which demonstrates two - armed grand design spirals in the @xmath60 band ; thornley ( @xcite ) has found them in three flocculent galaxies of four ones which were investigated , and grosbol and patsis ( @xcite ) report several more objects of this kind .",
    "one of the galaxies , ngc  5055 , has been studied in detail by thornley and mundy ( @xcite ) ; the infrared spiral arms have appeared to demonstrate also hi and co concentrations and prominent gas streaming motions .",
    "so , global density waves are perhaps frequent enough in the gaseous disks of flocculent galaxies , and nothing prevents flocculent galaxies to possess triaxial bulges .",
    "another feature of gas behaviour found by us  nuclear gaseous `` polar ring '' ( @xcite )  is not predicted by detailed dynamical simulations of bars because these simulations are mostly two - dimensional , and here we need to involve @xmath62 direction .",
    "but there was an interesting observational note of sofue and wakamatsu ( @xcite ) ; they have seen an asymmetrical dust lane orthogonal to the global bar in the center of face - on sb galaxy m  83 .",
    "their physical arguments in favor of polar orbit predominance for the nuclear gas of barred galaxies are convincing enough .",
    "theoretical predictions of bar effects on stellar kinematics do not contradict our results too .",
    "the two bulge kinematical subsystems , prograde and retrograde , can be explained either by specific projection of elliptical streamlines of stars in the triaxial potential or by a presence of retrograde orbits in the triaxial potential : e. g. , the recent dynamical investigation of wozniak and pfenniger ( @xcite ) has shown that in different models from 15%  to 30%  ( by mass ) stars of a bar are on retrograde orbits .",
    "perhaps , a set of phenomena which we have derived here for ngc  2841 is sufficient for specialists in dynamics to build a model of the triaxial bulge in this galaxy and to answer if we can explain the whole phenomena in the frame of this model or some merger events must be involved .",
