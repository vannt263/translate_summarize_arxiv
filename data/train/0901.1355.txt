    "gaseous infall onto galactic disks from their halos has long been considered to play vital roles in various aspects of galaxy formation and evolution , such as formation of s0 galaxies from truncation of halo gas infall ( e.g. , larson et al . 1980 ) , maintenance of spiral arms in disk galaxies ( e.g. , sellwood & carlberg 1984 ) , and as a solution to the so - called g - dwarf problem ( e.g. , pagel 1997 ) . the total masses and abundance properties of halo gas infalling onto disks and the timescales of gas infall have been considered to be key determinants which can control galaxy evolution processes ( e.g. , sellwood & carlberg 1984 ) , in particular , chemical evolution of disk galaxies ( e.g. , chiappini et al .",
    "although it remains largely unclear both observationally and theoretically how halo gas can be accreted gradually onto disks , the gradual infall of halo gas is one of key ingredients in most chemical evolution models that successfully explain their chemical properties ( e.g. , matteucci & franois 1989 ) .",
    "it is well established that there are significantly metal - rich disk stars with [ fe / h]@xmath6 in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , feltzing & gustafsson 1998 ; bensby et al .",
    "recent observational and theoretical studies have suggested that the canonical models of the galactic chemical evolution based on infall of metal - poor halo gas have a serious problem in explaining the observed presence of metal - rich stars with [ fe / h ] = + 0.2@xmath70.4 ( e.g. , tsujimoto 2007 ) .",
    "one of possible ideas to solve this problem is that the galactic disk experienced accretion of metal - rich gas which originated from the bulge : the observed rather metal - rich disk stars in the solar neighborhood were formed from gas ejected from the bulge ( tsujimoto 2007 ) .",
    "it is , however , totally unclear whether the gas ejected from the galactic bulge can really reach the solar - neighborhood under hydrodynamical influences of the gaseous halo owing to lack of extensive numerical studies on dynamical fates of the ejected bulge gas .",
    "the purpose of this letter is thus to show , for the first time , how gaseous halos of disk galaxies influence metal - rich stellar winds from the bulges through nuclear activity ( i.e. , starbursts and agn ) .",
    "we numerically investigate whether and how stellar winds from bulges ( or stellar ejecta due to supernova feedback ) can be accreted onto the disks after hydrodynamical interaction between the ejecta and the gaseous halos .",
    "this investigation is important , not only because recent observational studies have found evidence of large - scale outflow from bulges in the galaxy and other disk galaxies ( e.g. , bland - hawthorn & cohen 2003 ; matthews & grijs 2004 ; veilleux et al . 2005 ) , but also because the physical role of galactic gaseous halos in chemical evolution of disk galaxies has not been so far investigated by numerical simulations .",
    "we mainly discuss how the total amount and distribution of gas ejected from a bulge and then accreted onto the disk depend on physical properties of the gaseous halo and the bulge ejecta .",
    "it should be stressed here that the bulge wind would need to have taken place in the galaxy several gyr ago to explain the possible ages of the super metal - rich solar neighborhood stars ( tsujimoto 2007 ) .",
    "we numerically investigate the dynamical evolution of gas ejected from bulges in disk galaxies using our own grape - sph codes as we have done in previous studies ( e.g. , bekki & chiba 2006 ) .",
    "a disk galaxy is represented by a dark matter halo , gaseous halo , stellar and gaseous disks , a stellar bulge , and gas initially within the bulge ( referred to as `` bulge gas '' for convenience from now on ) .",
    "the dark matter halo has an `` nfw '' profile ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) with total mass of @xmath8 , scale length @xmath9 , and @xmath10 parameter of 10 .",
    "the gaseous halo has mass @xmath11 and the same spatial distribution as the dark matter and is assumed to be initially in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the initial gaseous temperature of a halo gas particle is therefore determined by the gas density , total mass , and gravitational potential at the location of the particle via euler s equation for hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. , the equation 1e-8 in binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the bulge has a hernquist profile ( hernquist 1990 ) with mass @xmath12 and scale - length @xmath13 .",
    "the disk has an exponential density profile with mass @xmath14 , radius @xmath15 , and scale length @xmath4 (= @xmath16 ) .",
    "the stellar and gaseous disks have masses of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , and the same exponential density profile , and the gas mass fraction ( @xmath19 ) is a free parameter .",
    "in addition to the rotational velocity due to the gravitational field of disk , halo , bulge components , initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersion are assigned to the disk component according to the epicyclic theory using toomre s parameter ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) q = 1.5 .",
    "we do not include the outflow of stellar winds from stars in the disk in the present models , because we think that the stellar winds with lower metallicities do not significantly influence chemical evolution of the disk in comparison with the metal - rich bulge wind .",
    "the initial distribution of the bulge gas with mass @xmath20 is assumed to be the same as that of the bulge and each bulge gas particle is assumed to be ejected from the bulge in the radial direction with the ejection velocity @xmath21 . also the particles are assumed to have initial rotational velocities of @xmath22 ( around the @xmath23-axis ) ranging from 0 to a circular velocity at @xmath24 .",
    "we show the results of the models with @xmath25 km s@xmath26 , because the results do not depend strongly on @xmath22 .",
    "all bulge gas particles are assumed to have the same initial @xmath21 and @xmath22 in each simulation .",
    "the initial temperature of the bulge gas ( @xmath27 ) is assumed to be @xmath28 k , which corresponds to warm ionized gas observed in starburst galaxies such as m82 ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "the models with very high temperatures of @xmath29 k do not show significant gas accretion onto disks .",
    "since we mainly discuss the abundance properties of the galactic disk , we chose the following values of the model parameters for disk galaxies : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 kpc , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 kpc .",
    "the most important parameters in the present study are the mean halo gas density @xmath0 within @xmath37 determined from @xmath11 and @xmath21 for a given @xmath20 .",
    "although we have investigated many models with different @xmath0 and @xmath21 , we show the results of the standard model m1 with @xmath38 @xmath2 , @xmath39 km s@xmath26 , and @xmath40 .",
    "strong bulge winds can be more clearly seen in the models with @xmath41 km s@xmath26 .",
    "sembach et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the galaxy gaseous halo is highly extended ( @xmath42 kpc ) and low - density ( @xmath43 @xmath2 ) , which means that the adopted @xmath0 is reasonable .",
    "the total number of particles used in a simulation ranges from 228805 to 258805 depending on @xmath44 and @xmath11 .",
    "parameter values of the models ( m1 to m7 ) discussed in this paper are shown in table 1 .",
    "we do not discuss how rotation of gaseous halos influences the accretion processes of bulge gas onto disks , because we find that the influence is not significant .",
    "we show some results of comparative models in which @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath2 : these models enable us to grasp essential roles of gaseous halos in the accretion processes , though they are unrealistic .",
    "we will describe in detail the results of models not discussed in this paper ( e.g. , those with different @xmath20 and @xmath22 ) in our future papers .",
    "we mainly investigate the final total mass of bulge gas particles settled around `` the solar neighborhood '' ( @xmath47 ) with 7 kpc @xmath48 10 kpc and @xmath49 kpc ( @xmath50 ) for each model .",
    "we also investigate the mass ratio ( @xmath51 ) of @xmath50 to @xmath20 for each model .",
    "the final gaseous distributions at @xmath52 gyr correspond to those of the galaxy about several gyr ago in the present study .",
    "fig . 1 shows how gas ejected from a bulge evolves with time during hydrodynamical interaction between the gas and the halo gas in a disk galaxy for the standard model m1 .",
    "although a significant fraction of the gas once escapes from the bulge ( @xmath53 gyr ) , most of the gas can be finally returned to the disk plane owing to gaseous pressure from the halo and the disk ( @xmath52 gyr ) .",
    "the bulge gas particles initially in the central region of the bulge can interact so strongly with the disk gas particles immediately after the ejection that a thin disk can be formed from the bulge gas at @xmath54 kpc for a short time scale ( @xmath55 gyr ) .",
    "the bulge gas particles ejected from the bulge regions with larger @xmath56 can be later accreted onto the outer part of the disk and consequently can rotate around the center of the galaxy .",
    "the mean orbital eccentricity of bulge gas particles in the solar neighborhood is 0.08 in this model , which means that the orbits become almost circular , because the particles have acquired orbital angular momentum during hydrodynamical interaction with the disk gas .",
    "2 shows that @xmath50 increases with time owing to rapid accretion of the bulge gas and the mean accretion rate within 0.45 gyr is @xmath57 yr@xmath26 in the standard model .",
    "the mass - ratio ( @xmath51 ) of @xmath50 to @xmath20 is @xmath58 , which means that a small fraction of the bulge gas can be accreted onto the solar neighborhood .",
    "2 also shows that this result of small @xmath50 is true for the comparative model m2 with reasonable @xmath0 , which suggests that the bulge gas can not so efficiently be accreted onto the disk outside the solar neighborhood irrespective of @xmath59 .",
    "the more rapid accretion and smaller @xmath50 in the model m2 is due largely to the stronger hydrodynamical interaction between the bulge and the halo gas .",
    "3 shows that almost 80% of the bulge gas can be accreted onto the ( inner ) disk region with @xmath60 kpc in the standard model : this _ preferential accretion _ can be clearly seen also in the model m2 .",
    "4 compares the final distributions of bulge gas particles at @xmath52 gyr between different four models ( m@xmath61 ) .",
    "only a compact thin disk with @xmath62 can be developed from the bulge gas in the model m3 without halo gas , which clearly demonstrates that hydrodynamical interaction between bulge and halo gas in a disk galaxy is crucial for the accretion of the bulge gas onto the outer part of the disk .",
    "model m4 contain no disk and halo gas ( i.e. , @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath2 ) and does not show a thin disk , which means that the presence of gas disks is also important for recycling of the bulge ejecta in disk galaxies .",
    "this result of m4 combined with that of m1 confirms that hydrodynamical interaction between bulge and disk gas is essential for forming a _ rotating _ gas disk composed of the bulge gas .",
    "the bulge gas can be pushed back to the inner disk more strongly and quickly by the halo gas owing to stronger hydrodynamical pressure of the gaseous halo against the bulge gas in the model m2 . in this case",
    "the bulge gas can be accreted only onto the inner disk rather than the outer one in m2 : only a very small fraction of the bulge gas can reach the solar neighborhood and outer gaseous streams and small gas clumps seen in the standard model are not seen in m2 .",
    "the small gas clumps seen in the standard model might well be identified as high - velocity clouds , if they can form h  i gas owing to efficient cooling .",
    "less energetic gaseous flow from the bulge can be pushed back to the disk by the gaseous halo so that a thin disk with no small gas clumps is formed in the model m5 .",
    "the dependences of @xmath51 on model parameters are summarized as follows .",
    "firstly , there is an optimum @xmath21 which maximizes @xmath51 for a reasonable @xmath38 @xmath2 . a larger fraction of bulge gas can escape from the disk for larger @xmath21 so that a smaller fraction of the ejecta is finally accreted onto the solar neighborhood in the model m6 with @xmath63 km s@xmath26 . on the other hand ,",
    "a smaller fraction of the bulge gas can reach @xmath64 owing to less energetic flow so that a smaller fraction of the gas can be accreted onto the solar neighborhood in model m5 with @xmath65 km s@xmath26 .",
    "thus , @xmath51 is maximum for moderately energetic stellar winds such as @xmath39 km s@xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath51 can be higher for higher @xmath0 in the models with @xmath63 km s@xmath26 : in this case , higher densities of the halo gas are required for preventing the bulge gas from escaping the disk for more energetic stellar winds .",
    "this @xmath59-dependence of @xmath51 is totally different from that seen for @xmath39 km s@xmath26 , which implies that @xmath51 depends on @xmath0 and @xmath21 in a complicated way .",
    "the model m4 with no halo / disk gas shows @xmath51 ( 0.18 ) higher than that in model m3 with disk gas .",
    "such high @xmath51 in m4 is due to bulge gas particles that happen to be around the solar - neighborhood but are not rotating the disk : these particles soon return back to their original locations .",
    "it should be finally noted that the present results do not depend strongly on @xmath22 .",
    "our results indicate for the first time that gaseous halos of disk galaxies are very important for chemical evolution of the disks in the sense that they enable the galaxies to recycle the metal - rich stellar winds from the bulges and accelerate the chemical enrichment of galactic disks .",
    "the derived preferential accretion of the gaseous ejecta onto the inner disks will lead to a steepening of the abundance gradient after the action of strong central starbursts in the bulges followed by stellar winds .",
    "this steep abundance gradient is predicted to flatten with time owing to a subsequent chemical enrichment under an accretion of low - metallicity infall from the halo ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "2008 ) , which is in accord with the observed flattening feature in radial metallicity gradients over the last several gyr ( chen et al .",
    "2003 ; maciel et al . 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "our important finding is that the metal - rich gaseous ejecta from the bulge can reach and chemically enrich the solar neighborhood through a one - time sporadic accretion event triggered by a starburst .",
    "this mechanism offers a promising channel to produce super - metal - rich stars with @xmath66[fe / h]@xmath67 , the presence of which can not be accounted for by the conventional scheme of galactic chemical evolution models ( tsujimoto 2007 ) .",
    "an important caveat is that the observed very metal - rich stars with [ fe / h]@xmath68 would need to be formed directly from the bulge gas without significant dilution with metal - poor halo and disk gas .    using the observed metallicity distribution function by nordstrm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we estimate that the mass fraction of metal - rich stars with @xmath66[fe / h]@xmath67 is about 4% in the solar annulus .",
    "this means that the possible total _",
    "stellar _ mass ( @xmath69 ) of the metal - rich stars for @xmath70 kpc @xmath48 @xmath71 kpc ( i.e. , the solar annulus ) is about @xmath72 for the adopted galactic disk mass of @xmath73 and the exponential scale length of 3.5 kpc .",
    "the total mass of the metal - rich stars thus would give some constraints on ( i ) the total mass of the initial bulge wind ( thus the strength of the central starburst ) and ( ii ) to what degree the metal - rich bulge gas ( e.g. , [ fe / h]@xmath74 + 0.4 ) needs to be diluted via mixing of halo / disk gas to form less metal - rich stars with [ fe / h]@xmath74 + 0.2 .",
    "our study shows that about 1 % of gas ejected from bulges in disk galaxies can be accreted onto the disks at @xmath75 for a reasonable set of model parameters in the present study .",
    "this suggests that chemical evolution of the outer parts ( @xmath76 ) of the disks can not be so strongly influenced by the accretion of the metal - rich gaseous ejecta .",
    "this also implies that if infalling metal - rich gas with [ fe / h]@xmath74 + 0.4 in the galaxy can be mixed well with the gas with [ fe / h ] @xmath77 and a similar mass already present in the solar neighborhood and then form new stars from the mixed gas , the new stars would have [ fe / h]@xmath74 + 0.2 : they however are unlikely to exhibit super - solar metallicities with [ fe / h]@xmath78 .",
    "however , if new stars can form preferentially from the metal - rich gas _ during the accretion of the gas onto the disk _ for some physical reasons , formation of new stars with super - solar metallicities would be possible .",
    "our simulations imply that ( i ) dilution of the metal - rich bulge gas is likely to occur after the accretion of the gas onto the galaxy and ( ii ) the dilution due to interaction with halo gas would be unlikely owing to rapid accretion of the bulge gas .",
    "previous chemical evolution models of disk galaxies did not consider _ rapid accretion of metal - rich gas ejected from bulges onto disks _",
    "( e.g. , lacey & fall 1985 ; prantzos & aubert 1995 ; chiappini et al .",
    "the present study suggests that future more sophisticated chemical evolution models need to include possible influences of the rapid accretion on chemical evolution for disk galaxies , in particular , for those with bigger bulges which would have experienced stronger nuclear starbursts .",
    "the present study has not clarified ( i ) local ( pc - scale ) star formation processes during the accretion of metal - rich gas onto disks and ( ii ) metallicities of new stars formed from the star formation .",
    "we plan to investigate numerically how mixing processes of metal - poor disk gas and metal - rich bulge ejecta within disks determine the metallicities of new stars formed during the accretion of the ejecta .",
