    "the original dicke state focuses on the spin-@xmath6 case .",

    "the eigenstates and magnetic response in spin-@xmath0 and @xmath2 bose - einstein condensates were discussed by koashi  @xcite .",
    "these systems with high spin have more spin orientations and more quantum eigenstates such that richer physical phenomena can emerge .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to construct the basic quantum states based on dicke states for the high - spin cases .",
    "it is well known that the single particle is a qubit with only two magnetic components for a spin-@xmath6 many - body system .",
