    "the aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical description of the way in which the boundaries of voids in amorphous solids move under the influence of external loads .",
    "an obvious example is dynamic fracture .",
    "the evolution of cracks is traditionally described by linear elasticity .",
    "however , elasticity by itself does not provide a dynamical theory of crack motion but , instead , uses criteria such as energy balance to provide bounds on the velocities of straight cracks @xcite .",
    "this approach was challenged by one of us in @xcite .",
    "more recently , starting with closely related ideas , it was shown in @xcite that taking into account the dynamic degrees of freedom near a moving crack tip resolves various inconsistencies in traditional theories of linear elasticity fracture mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , the theoretical approach of @xcite is far from complete ; it is still not an accurate and internally self - consistent description of free - boundary motion .",
    "we do not deal with the actual dynamics of cracks in this paper .",
    "rather , we apply the shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) theory developed in two recent papers @xcite to the dynamics of a circular hole in an infinite medium .",
    "we have chosen this highly symmetric example in order to simplify the tensorial character of the theory , and to help in developing analytic methods that may remain applicable in less symmetric situations .",
    "as we shall see , the solutions of the circle problem provide a wealth of information about the ways in which stress concentrations near moving free boundaries induce plastic deformation .",
    "the stz approach that we employ here is based on recent developments in the theory of dynamic elasto - plastic deformation of amorphous materials at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the theory was applied to a homogenous situation in @xcite and the results were compared to recent numerical simulations in @xcite . the stz theory , originally proposed in @xcite , deviates from conventional approaches @xcite by focusing on the nature of the microscopic mechanisms for plastic deformation in amorphous media .",
    "these mechanisms are incorporated into the macroscopic description by internal state fields .",
    "an important observation is that the plastic strain itself can not be one of these fields .",
    "for that to be true , the material would somehow have to encode information about its entire history of deformation starting from some reference state .",
    "this is not possible .",
    "more realistically , the memory of prior deformations , and the rate at which that memory is lost , must be encoded in the internal state variables and their equations of motion .",
    "the identification of the physically appropriate microscopic variables is based here on the notion that stz s are sparsely distributed , localized clusters of molecules that are especially susceptible to rearrangement in response to applied stresses . to take the stz s and their role in the dynamics into account ,",
    "one introduces a scalar field that describes the density of stz s and a tensorial one that describes their orientation .",
    "equations of motion for both the plastic strain rate and these internal state fields are obtained by assuming that stz s change orientation ( deform by finite amounts ) at rates that depend on the stress .",
    "in addition , stz s are created and annihilated at rates proportional to the rate at which the energy of plastic deformation is dissipated @xcite .",
    "an earlier stz analysis of the circle problem @xcite was based on a  quasilinear \" version of the theory that used a conveniently truncated form of the transition rates @xcite .",
    "this relatively simple theory captured linear visco - elasticity at small stresses , finite visco - plasticity at intermediate stresses , and unbounded plastic deformation at large stresses as a result of an exchange of dynamic stability between jammed ( non - deforming ) and unjammed ( deforming ) states of the system .",
    "some memory effects were also described successfully .",
    "the quasilinear theory , however , had serious limitations ; and therefore we base the present analysis on the recent version of stz theory @xcite that starts with more physically realistic assumptions . in @xcite , it was argued that the defining feature of a system at low temperatures is the constraint that , because thermal activation of stz transitions is negligible or nonexistent , each molecular rearrangement occurs in response to an external driving force .",
    "no motion occurs in the absence of such a force , and no rearrangement moves in opposition to the direction of that force .",
    "in addition , this version of stz theory includes the possibility that stz s occur in many different types and with a range of different transition thresholds .",
    "we list here some important respects in which the present analysis differs from the previous work on the circular hole problem in @xcite and elsewhere @xcite :    1 .",
    "we employ here the fully nonlinear , athermal stz theory described in @xcite .",
    "the material time derivatives are expressed in a proper eulerian formulation ; and the theory is consistent with all relevant conservation laws and symmetries .",
    "3 .   the calculation described here takes into account the dynamics of the density of stz s _ via _ an effective - temperature formulation , a feature that is shown in @xcite to be essential for self - consistency in these theories .",
    "the focus here is on the transient growth regime that is relevant to dynamic situations such as fracture . instead of considering only constant loads",
    ", we look at the elasto - plastic response to a stress pulse , and study the behavior during both loading and subsequent unloading .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",

    "[ summary ] , we offer a summary and further discussion . in appendix [ cavitation ] , we show how to compute the threshold for unbounded growth of the circular hole under constant remote loading .",
    "we start by writing the full set of equations for a general two - dimensional elasto - plastic material .",
    "we define the total rate - of - deformation tensor @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the material velocity at the location @xmath2 at time @xmath3 .",
    "this type of eulerian formulation has the advantage that it disposes of any reference state , allowing free discussion of small or large deformations .",

    "the material velocity at the edge of the hole @xmath38 is just the rate of change of the hole radius @xmath39 and therefore , using the second equation in ( [ d_components ] ) , we see that the hole evolves according to @xmath40 once @xmath41 is specified , the last relation becomes an equation of motion for the boundary of the hole .      in order to explore the analytic structure of the problem , we use eqs .",

    "we will pay greater attention to a class of situations in which the load takes the form of a stress pulse of finite duration , because we believe that such a pulse may be relevant to fracture dynamics .",
    "plastic deformation of a material failing by crack propagation is localized ( if it happens at all ) near the fracture surfaces . at any given material point",
    ", deformation occurs only during a short time interval as the crack tip passes nearby .",
    "specifically , a material element lying ahead of a crack tip experiences first an increasing stress as the crack tip opens , and then a decreasing stress as the load vanishes on the newly formed  and deformed  fracture surfaces .    to simulate such a process in the circular geometry ,",
    "we study a time dependent loading scheme in which the remote stress @xmath18 increases monotonically from zero to a peak stress @xmath135 , and then returns monotonically to zero : @xmath136 an example with @xmath137 and @xmath138 is shown in fig .",

    "this estimate is consistent with the discussion in @xcite , where the plastic zone size was dynamically adjusted so that the time needed for the crack to pass this zone was of the order of the plastic relaxation time .",

    "that value of @xmath82 is roughly an atomic spacing divided by a sound speed .",
    "these estimates lead us to believe that , although stz plasticity is slow on atomic time scales , it is easily fast enough to be relevant to fracture .",
    "clearly , this estimate of relevant time scales will have to be reexamined when the theory is applied to realistic models of fracture where surface tension is important .",
    "it is convenient for both analytic and numerical simplicity to work in the limit of elastic ( as well as plastic ) incompressibility .",

    "the qualitative picture that we take from these results is that of a plastically deformed region near the hole edge ( or near any defect boundary in the general case ) , outside of which @xmath27 retains its elastic solution proportional to @xmath158 , but within which @xmath27 decreases and may change sign , consistent with an irreversible outward displacement of the material near the hole .",
    "a principal objective of this investigation has been to study the dynamics of time - dependent plasticity in the neighborhood of a symmetrically loaded circular hole , and , from this study , to learn how to construct realistic approximations for less symmetric situations .",
    "we have seen in the preceding section that , under certain circumstances , plastic deformation remains localized in a relatively narrow zone near the hole .",
    "this observation leads us to believe that some sort of boundary - layer approximation might have at least limited validity in interesting applications such as asymmetric void growth or fracture .",
    "in what follows , we explore one class of such approximations .",
    "the numerical examples illustrated in figs .",
    "[ load_unload2 ] and [ load_unload4 ] have several common features that need to be captured in any useful approximation .",
    "most importantly , the dynamic behavior is qualitatively different in what we call the `` active plastic phase ''  roughly speaking , the time interval in which the hole is growing by plastic deformation  than it is in the `` elastic unloading phase '' where plastic deformation ceases .",
    "during the active plastic phase , as soon as @xmath154 exceeds @xmath91 , plastic deformation occurs in an active plastic zone , @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the radius at which @xmath172 during this phase , no irreversible deformation has occurred for @xmath173 , and thus the stress field in this outer region is simply @xmath174    this behavior changes as elastic unloading begins . as seen in figs .",
    "[ load_unload2 ] and [ load_unload4 ] , @xmath57 reaches its peak considerably later than when the load @xmath18 peaks at @xmath175 . between @xmath176 and the time at which @xmath57 reaches its maximum , and for some time after that , the hole continues to grow plastically while the system as a whole contracts elastically . during that interval ,",
    "the stress at the boundary of the hole , @xmath177 , drops rapidly toward the yield stress @xmath91 ; while @xmath178 , by the definition of @xmath159 , remains equal to @xmath91 .",
    "the transition between the active plastic and the elastic unloading phases that is important for our purposes occurs when @xmath177 passes downward through @xmath91 at a time that we call @xmath179 .    to see what happens near @xmath179 ,",

    "note that at @xmath186 @xmath37 has already vanished .",
    "the crucial observation is that @xmath181 extends across the whole active plastic zone , @xmath187 , until @xmath188 , at which time , at least to a rough first approximation , it vanishes almost uniformly everywhere .",
    "the elastic unloading phase , starting at about time @xmath179 , evolves as an entirely elastic response to the decreasing driving force , conditioned by the material displacements that occurred during the plastic loading phase . during this part of the unloading process",
    ", there is no longer an active plastic zone , but there remains a plastically deformed region  a `` process zone ''  within which irreversible material displacements give rise to residual stresses .",
    "the process zone extends from @xmath57 out to the most distant material point at which plastic deformation occurred , that is , out to @xmath189 advected back toward @xmath57 by elastic relaxation .",
    "elastic unloading persists at least until @xmath190 when the remote load @xmath18 vanishes . as seen in fig .",
    "[ load_unload4 ] , the stress near the hole may become so large and negative that it drives plastic strain recovery .",
    "this behavior occurs only for large peak stresses , and does not occur when the remote stresses are smaller than about @xmath191 in the present model .",
    "we will not include plastic strain recovery in our boundary - layer analysis , and simply will point out where it is missing .",
    "our strategy for developing a boundary - layer approximation is to write equations of motion for quantities defined only near the boundary , i.e. within the process zone , and then to deduce the boundary motion from these local quantities instead of solving for fields everywhere in the system . in our case ,",
    "the relevant boundary is just the hole radius @xmath57 .",

    "the obvious candidate is eq.([r_dot_incom ] ) , which already involves only quantities defined in the process zone .",
    "this equation demands special attention , however , because it has been derived using exact mathematical relationships that are unique to circular symmetry , and because it explicitly involves the remote driving force @xmath18 which entered the analysis _ via _ those exact relationships .",
    "we need some such relation to determine the coupling between the remote driving force and the boundary .",
    "if the boundary - layer strategy is to be successful , we ultimately will have to interpret @xmath18 as a quantity emerging from solutions of a more general elasticity problem .",
    "for present purposes , however , we accept eq.([r_dot_incom ] ) as written , except that we simplify it by neglecting the term @xmath199 in the denominator on the right - hand side .",

    "so long as we remain in the active plastic phase , and can assume that @xmath171 remains the outer boundary of the material region in which @xmath207 is nonzero , we can use eq.([elastic_r1 ] ) for the stress outside @xmath205 , and write eq.([integral ] ) in the form @xmath208 then , in the spirit of our approximation for @xmath181 in the active plastic region , we make a linear approximation for @xmath49 , using the fact that this stress is equal to @xmath91 at @xmath159 , and allowing @xmath209 to be an as yet undetermined function of time . specifically , for @xmath187 and for times @xmath210 such that @xmath211 , we have : @xmath212 inserting eq.([linear - s ] ) into eq.([integral2 ] ) , and linearizing in @xmath213 , we find , again for @xmath210 , @xmath214 note that when @xmath18 is increasing and is smaller than @xmath91 , there is no active plastic zone at all , i.e. @xmath215 . using eq.([dintegral ] ) , eq.([third_eq_simple_2 ] ) becomes @xmath216    we emphasize that , in this approximation , the end of the active plastic phase occurs at the time @xmath179 when @xmath217 . by definition , @xmath218 , and therefore @xmath219 throughout @xmath220 .",

    "the comparison is excellent for @xmath223 , even though @xmath224 is about 0.5 , which is not that small .",

    "nevertheless , the values @xmath227 and @xmath228 are well approximated in this period of plastic strain recovery .",
    "we can push the comparison between the boundary - layer approximation and the exact results further by computing the residual stresses in the process zone .",
    "we do this as follows .",
    "we note first that eq.([final eqs_bl1 ] ) can be used for any radius @xmath229 , not just the radius of the hole @xmath57 . at times later than @xmath179 , the quantity @xmath230 appearing here vanishes for any @xmath231 .",

    "finally , we know that @xmath235 for all @xmath231 between @xmath17 and @xmath159 ; so we can use eq.([final eqs_bl1 ] ) to compute the advected value of @xmath236 at any later time @xmath3 , and then plot this value as a function of the advected position @xmath237 .",
    "the functions @xmath49 computed in this way , for @xmath223 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ jim ] . outside the process zone",
    ", we have used the elastic solution with @xmath238 .",
    "the agreement between the full solution and the boundary layer predictions lends further support to the philosophy presented in this section .",
    "we have presented a derivation of the equations of motion for a moving free boundary , in this case a circle , using linear elasticity and the athermal stz theory of amorphous plasticity .",
    "these equations were solved numerically and yielded some interesting results .",
    "we looked especially at loading scenarios in which the material was subjected , at large distances from the hole , to stress pulses whose durations were comparable to the plastic relaxation time for the stz mechanism . for the range of material parameters chosen here , which we believe to be characteristic of realistic amorphous solids , the irreversible displacement of the boundary of the hole was small .",
    "however , the width of the region in which plastic deformation occurred , as evidenced by increased internal disorder and residual stresses , became comparable to the radius of the circle for stress pulses whose peak strengths @xmath239 were twice the yield stress @xmath91 .",
    "we also found that strong enough stress pulses , @xmath240 induce reverse , plastic strain recovery near the edge of the hole .",
    "the theory as written is rather cumbersome even for the circular symmetry considered here .",
    "it is therefore with some relief that we have found that a boundary layer approximation , using only quantities defined on the circumference of the circle and their coupling to the remote stress , succeeds in capturing the plastic effects quite well . specifically , despite several apparently serious oversimplifications , this approximation accurately reproduces the irreversible displacement of the radius of the circle and the residual stress found in its neighborhood .",
    "we propose that such boundary layer theories might find useful applications in less symmetric situations , not the least interesting being fracture dynamics .",
    "a next issue on our agenda is the dynamic stability of our circular solutions",
    ". it will be interesting to learn whether our equations of motion predict that the growing circular hole becomes unstable against symmetry - breaking perturbations , for example , whether it forms fingers that might evolve into cracks , or whether a perturbed circular solution can survive .",
    "the transition between these two possibilities , if found , might shed light on the brittle - to - ductile transition in visco - plastic materials .",
    "along the same lines , it will be important to learn how strongly the circular behavior itself , and the stability of circular symmetry , depend on specific details of our model such as elastic compressibility , initial states of disorder , or the absence of thermal effects .",
