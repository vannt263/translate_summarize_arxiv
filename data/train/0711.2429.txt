    "dark - matter halos , the satellites ( often referred to as substructures or subhalos ) show significantly different properties than those of the `` luminous '' satellites around galaxies like the milky way .",
    "an example of this discrepancy is the `` missing satellite problem '' : subhalos outnumber the bright satellites by factors of a hundred or more @xcite .",
    "furthermore , their spatial distribution is typically much shallower than observed for the luminous satellites @xcite . therefore , the relation between resolved substructures / subhalos in dark matter simulations and the luminous satellites in galaxy halos is still unclear .",
    "attempts to reconcile these two populations , using semi - analytic models of galaxy formation @xcite or full - fleshed sph - simulations @xcite have produced interesting results , and helped us gain insight into the relevant processes on the smallest galactic scales .    in the past ten years",

    "these objects would share similar energies and angular momenta producing a strong alignment along great circles on the sky @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been argued that the mw satellites define a disk - like structure , that is so highly flattened ( _ rms _ thickness of @xmath3 kpc ) that may at first sight be inconsistent with cdm models @xcite .",
    "however , sophisticated modelling combining semi - analytic galaxy formation recipes with dark matter simulations has produced results that are consistent with observations @xcite .    in the past two years ,",
    "about a dozen low surface brightness dwarf satellite galaxies around the mw have been found in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "this is an increase by a factor of two in the number of known satellites .",
    "because of the strong selection bias ( sdss focus is on the north galactic pole ) , it is unclear whether these satellites confirm the flattened disk - like structure .",
    "it is also unclear whether they help solve the missing satellite problem @xcite .",
    "satellites around m31 also show peculiarities in their distribution , such as an excess of objects on the side closest to the milky way @xcite , and possibly a similar degree of alignment @xcite .",
    "these facts have motivated us to revisit the distribution and properties of the subhalo population in cdm simulations .",
    "in particular , here we focus on the infall of substructures onto a milky - way like dark matter halo in a @xmath0cdm cosmogony .",

    "this effect is much stronger at the low mass end of the group mass spectrum .",
    "for example , a group with total mass @xmath59 can consist of ten subhalos of @xmath60 or two of @xmath61 . on the other hand a group of @xmath62 can only be the result of a pair of subhalos of @xmath63 in our simulation .",

    "motivated by their claim and the results presented above , we wish to test here under what conditions such a configuration is likely in a @xmath0cdm simulation like ours .",
    "there are many possible ways to define the degree of flattening of a distribution .",
    "we shall here concentrate on the following two measures :    1 .   the minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath68 derived from the eigenvalues of the diagonalised inertia tensor defined by the satellites positions .",

    "( [ inertia_tensor_ell_eq ] ) in which the positions were normalized by their ellipsoidal distance .",
    "our preference for this new definition is based on the fact that the determination of the ellipsoidal distance is simultaneous to the determination of the eigenvalues of the inertia tensor @xmath71 .",
    "this means that an iterative algorithm is used , in which outliers are successively discarded , until the desired level of convergence is reached ( see sec .",

    ", we will only consider the eleven `` traditional '' milky way satellites .",
    "this enables us to make a direct comparison to the work of @xcite . on the other hand , it ensures we are not affected by the strong observational bias in the sky distribution of the new satellites discovered by sdss , which reflects the fact that this survey has concentrated on the north galactic cap .",

    "the left panel shows the subhalos from `` groups '' while the right corresponds to ( a randomly selected subset from ) the `` field''.,scaledwidth=52.0% ]    given the large fraction of flattened configurations found in our simulations , we conclude that the spatial distribution of the @xmath89 milky way satellites can be reproduced within @xmath0cdm .",
    "the requirement is that these satellites fell onto the galactic halo in groups .",
    "we have analysed a high - resolution cosmological simulation of the formation of a milky way - like halo , focusing on the properties of the satellite population at the present - day .",
    "we have found that dark - matter subhalos are often accreted in groups in our simulations .",
    "roughly @xmath121 of the surviving subhalos with mass @xmath122 at the present epoch share this property .",
    "this is clearly a lower limit since we are not be able to identify accompanying halos below our resolution limit ( this is particularly severe at high - redshift ) .",
    "this group infall is apparent as an enhancement in the number of subhalos whose angular momentum orientation is similar , particularly at the time of infall .",
    "this signal is measurable also from the present - day angular momentum of subhalos , even for those accreted 8 gyr ago .",
    "these groups of subhalos share coherent orbits which can be traced back well before the accretion epoch .",
    "the differential group mass function follows a power - law distribution @xmath123 with @xmath56 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the differential mass function of subhalos in both galaxy and cluster - size halos , albeit with a shallower slope ( compared to @xmath124 as in e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have also studied the degree of flattening of the spatial distribution of subhalos in our simulation .",
    "the mean minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath68 of the inertia tensor defined by the positions of @xmath89 randomly selected subhalos with @xmath96 kpc is @xmath125 . in comparison",
    "the @xmath68 of the @xmath89 `` classical '' mw satellites is @xmath126 .",
    "imposing the centrally concentrated mw satellite radial distribution leads to @xmath127 and therefore somewhat alleviates the discrepancy with the observations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we have explored also how this planar configuration may be obtained as a result of the infall of satellites in groups .",
    "the observed correlation in the angular momentum orientation of subhalos naturally gives rise to disk - like configurations .",
    "for example , we find that if all subhalos are accreted from just one group , it is almost impossible to avoid a disk - like distribution ( @xmath12880% probability ) , while for accretion from just two groups , the likelihood of obtaining a distribution as planar as observed is 40% .",
    "these results may explain the origin of the ghostly streams proposed by @xcite .",
    "out of the streams originally proposed , only two appear to have survived the rigour of time , after modern and accurate measurements of proper motions have become available .",
    "@xcite confirmed the lmc - smc - umi - draco stream forms a kinematic group whose angular momentum separation is @xmath129 .",
    "more recently @xcite ruled out with @xmath130 confident level umi as a member using _ hst _ proper motions .",
    "the latest measurements of the fornax proper motion by @xcite has apparently confirmed the sculptor - sextans - fornax stream ( although previous measurements led to conflicting results , see @xcite ) .",
    "if some of the luminous satellites are embedded in dark ( sub)halos that fell in together , such coherent structures would be a naturally consequence of the hierarchical build - up of galaxies .",
    "in our simulations , such groups remain coherent in angular momentum ( i.e. they share similar orbital planes giving rise to great circle streams ) for approximately 8 gyr .",
    "this implies that these groups ( or satellites ) should have been accreted by the milky way at redshifts @xmath131 or below .",
    "one of the possible implications of the reality of the ghostly streams is that its member galaxies formed and evolved in a similar environment before falling into the milky way potential .",
    "this would have implications on the ( earliest ) stellar populations of these objects , such as for example , sharing a common metallicity floor @xcite . on the other hand , this implies that there should be groups that have not been able to host any luminous satellites .",
    "this would hint at a strong dependence on environment on the ability of a subhalo to retain gas @xcite , or be shielded from re - ionization by nearby sources @xcite .",
    "recent proper motion measurements of the large and small magellanic clouds by @xcite , as well as the simulations by @xcite suggest that these systems may have become bound to each other only recently .",
    "this would be fairly plausible in the context of our results .",
    "the clouds may well have been part of a recently accreted group ( see also * ? ? ? * for the link to leo i ) and it may not even be necessary for them to ever have been a binary system .",
    "this may also have implications on the computations of the past trajectories of these systems , particularly if both are embedded in a larger common dark - matter envelope @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that the dynamical peculiarities of the milky way satellites can be understood in the context of the concordance cosmological model .",
    "their properties must be a consequence of both the environment as well as of the hierarchical nature of the build up of galactic halos .",
