    "we study the dynamics of bending modes in a differentially rotating self - gravitating disk embedded in a dark matter halo .",
    "we show that the dynamical equation of a small bending with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath0 reduces to a compact quadratic eigenvalue problem when the galactic disk is approximated as a system of uniformly spaced rings ( see saha & jog 2006 ) .",
    "we notice that the bowl - shaped mode(m=0 ) oscillates much faster than the integral - sign warping mode ( m=1 ) of the disk .",
    "we use the linear and time dependent superposition of the m=0 and m=1 mode to generate various dynamical asymmetries in warps including the extreme l - shaped or one - sided warps and asymmetric u - shaped warps .",
    "so in our picture the presence of bowl - shaped mode is the primary reason for the various asymmetric warps in the disk .",
    "the asymmetry - index ( @xmath1 ) is basically a quantitative measure of the asymmetric warps in the disk .",
    "@xmath1 varies from 0 ( corresponding to symmetric warps ) to 1.0 ( corresponding to l - shaped warps ) ."
