    "while observations of gamma - ray burst counterparts appear to have determined the distance scale of these enigmatic events [ 1 ] , questions regarding the emission mechanism remain unanswered .",
    "models are tested against the newly discovered x - ray and optical power - law tails seen in two grbs [ 2,3 ] , however most of these were flexible enough to accomodate the observations .",
    "multiple gamma - ray emission mechanisms have also been found to be consistent with the _ time - integrated _ spectra making this another poor test of grb models .    in order to evaluate grb models , we look to the time evolution of grb spectra .",
    "most spectral evolution studies have looked only at the evolution of spectral hardness , which has historically been represented by either a hardness ratio or by the peak of the @xmath0 spectrum , @xmath1 [ 4 ] .",
    "we examine this as well as the evolution of the low - energy asymptotic slope @xmath2 ( as defined by the band grb function [ 5 ] ) . in the following section ,",
    "we show that most bursts require evolution of this second parameter .",
    "thus the shape , as well as the break energy , of the spectra evolves as a function of time .",
    "models which were consistent with the time - integrated specta can be inconsistent with the time - resolved spectra .",
    "below we confront first the synchrotron shock model and then the inverse comptonization model with our time - resolved batse burst spectra .",
    "we find that both models are currently unable to explain our observations .",
    "we first demonstrate that time - integrated burst spectra do not well represent the time - resolved spectra .",
    "previously we have found that a minimum first - order trend in @xmath2 is shown to exist in at least 46 of the 79 bursts we analyzed [ 6 ] .",
    "it is possible that some higher order evolution of @xmath2 may occur in these bursts . to test for this",
    ", we calculated the @xmath3 between the time - resolved , fitted values of @xmath2 and the weighted average value of @xmath2 in each burst .",
    "we found that only 30 out of the 79 bursts are consistent with an invariant @xmath2 , assuming @xmath4 as an acceptable cutoff [ 7 ] .",
    "we conclude that the remaining 63% of the bursts have a varying @xmath2 , consistent with the results of [ 6 ] .",
    "unfortunately , time - resolved @xmath5 values are poorly determined in a majority of the bursts in this sample .    as an example of spectral shape - shifting in grbs",
    ", we examine the early evolution of grb 970111 ( see figure [ fig1_5773 ] ) .",
    "we find the first several seconds to be remarkably similar to grb 910927 ( see figure  1 of [ 6 ] ) . both bursts exhibit steep _ positive _ low - energy power slopes .",
    "fitting the band grb function [ 5 ] to grb 970111 , we find @xmath6 , a value consistent with the maximum @xmath2 in grb 910927 .",
    "we would expect this value of @xmath2 from synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "however , with synchrotron self - absorption , @xmath2 is either @xmath7 in the case of a nonthermal plasma or @xmath8 for a thermal plasma [ 8 ] .",
    "this mechanism can not produce the variation of observed @xmath2 values .",
    "one prediction of synchrotron shock models is easily tested with grb spectral data . for these models",
    ", the asymptotic low - energy photon slope @xmath2 ( below the spectral break ) should be between @xmath9 , in the case of an instantaneous synchrotron spectrum , and @xmath10 , when the spectrum is integrated over the radiative decay of electron energies [ 9 ] .",
    "these predictions are tested by cohen et al . [ 9 ] with 11 _ time - integrated _ grbs . in these 11 cases ,",
    "the slope of the low - energy spectra is indeed in this range .",
    "however , time - resolved spectra reported in crider et al .",
    "[ 6 ] clearly show evidence for grb spectra which can not be explained with this mechanism .",
    "examination of a larger set of bursts show that many bursts have maximum @xmath2 values beyond the `` line - of - death '' ( @xmath11 ) predicted by synchrotron shock models [ 10 ] .    to evaluate the synchrotron shock model quantitatively , we began by finding the probabilities q of randomly getting poorer @xmath3 values when fitting the band grb function [ 5 ] to time bins selected from grb 910807 , grb 910927 , and grb 931126 .",
    "these are respectively 0.93 , 0.50 , and 0.25 suggesting that the band et al .",
    "function [ 5 ] adequately describes the observed spectra .",
    "when we instead fixed @xmath12 to represent the maximum slope allowed by synchrotron shock models , we found q values of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , which makes this model unacceptable in explaining the data . also , when fitting the time bin in grb 970111 where @xmath16 gave q=0.32 for the band et al .",
    "function compared to q=@xmath17 when @xmath2 is fixed to @xmath9 .",
    "three sample spectra from these bursts are plotted in figure [ vfv ] in a fashion similar to that of cohen et al . [ 9 ] where the limits of the synchrotron shock model are overlayed onto the deconvolved burst spectra .",
    "this figure clearly shows that these bursts spectral slopes are outside the range predicted by the synchrotron shock model .",
    "the generally decreasing nature of @xmath2 from values approaching @xmath18 is suggestive of saturated inverse compton scattering in a plasma experiencing thomson thinning [ 6,11 ] .",
    "however , many bursts show some evidence for an _ increase _ in @xmath2 at the beginning of pulses which would represent a thomson thickening .",
    "the observed changes in @xmath2 can not be attributed to statistical fluctuations or systematics .",
    "grb 950818 is an excellent example . to show",
    "more clearly how the thomson depth @xmath19 evolves in this burst , we fit it with the sunyaev - titarchuk model .",
    "the evolution of @xmath20 determined from these fits is shown in figure [ taurise_3765 ] . while this model does not often fit gamma - ray bursts well , fits with the band grb function [ 5 ] and comparisons with our simulated inverse compton spectra [ 11 ] indicate that the spectral break is always below 100 kev and that @xmath19 should be @xmath21 . in this parameter space ,",
    "the sunyaev - titarchuk model is appropriate if we ignore data above the spectral break which will be heavily influenced by any non - thermal component .",
    "the results of fitting this model to our data appear in the figure above and show that @xmath19 clearly increases and then falls during this burst .",
    "one means by which @xmath19 may rise and fall would be an initial compression of the plasma .",
    "future research will test if this is a valid hypothesis .",
    "we have found that most bursts show some degree of spectral  shape - shifting \" making the time - integrated spectrum an inadequate diagnostic of gamma - ray burst models . the high value of the low - energy spectral slope @xmath22 seen in some bursts and the flattening of this slope with time is incompatible with the synchrotron shock model .",
    "similarly , simple thomson thinning from an initial state of saturated comptonization can not explain the rise and fall of @xmath2 seen in some bursts",
    ". it may be possible to reproduce the observed spectra with a changing superposition of self - absorbed synchrotron spectra .",
    "however this has not yet been explored in detail within the construct of the blast - wave scenario .",
