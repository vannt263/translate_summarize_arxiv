    "at high temperature a phase transition occurs in qcd . in the quenched approximation ( i.e. without any light quarks )",
    "this transition is of first order and separates a low temperature confined phase from a high temperature deconfined phase .",
    "the dynamics of a system which crosses the transition temperature @xmath7 ( as e.g. in the early universe or in heavy ion collisions ) depends on the free energy @xmath8 of an interface of area @xmath9 between regions of confined and deconfined matter .",
    "the interface tension @xmath10 was investigated before in monte carlo simulations of lattice systems with @xmath2 using various approaches ( see @xcite ) .",
    "lately these results have been questioned based on an application of binder s histogram method to cubic spatial volumes @xmath11 with @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , these results might have been plagued by interfacial interactions .",
    "therefore , we present results using the same method but on asymmetric volumes ( @xmath13 ) thereby reducing these interactions .",
    "we consider su(3 ) pure gauge theory with the wilson action @xmath14 on a cylindrical lattice of size @xmath15 with @xmath16 at the critical coupling @xmath17 for @xmath2 .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in the time direction and @xmath18periodic boundary conditions @xcite in the spatial directions , i.e. @xmath19 because of the @xmath18periodic boundary conditions the value of the polyakov line @xmath20 will satisfy @xmath21 therefore , no bulk configurations in either of the two deconfined phases that have nonvanishing imaginary part of @xmath22 can exist and the probability distribution @xmath23 of @xmath24 takes the form sketched in fig.[fig : pmc ] .",
    "the system is most likely in either the one remaining deconfined phase corresponding to @xmath25 or the confined phase at @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath27 is increased from @xmath26 , bubbles of deconfined phase form .",
    "these configurations are suppressed by the interfacial free energy @xmath28 , where @xmath9 is the surface area of the bubble .",
    "it grows until finally its surface is larger than the surface @xmath29 of two planar interfaces which devide the lattice into three parts as depicted in the second part of fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] .",
    "since the interface area of the two planar interfaces is independent of @xmath27 the probability @xmath30 is constant in the region where their contributions dominate , i.e. around @xmath31 . because of the @xmath18periodic boundary conditions these interfaces always separate a region in the confined phase from one in the deconfined phase that has @xmath32 .",
    "thus the corresponding configurations will be exponentially suppressed by the interfacial free energy of two confined - deconfined interfaces .",
    "taking into account the capillary wave fluctuations of the interfaces as well as their translational degrees of freedom leads to additional power law corrections @xcite giving @xmath33 for @xmath34dimensional spatial volumes .",
    "this relation will be used to determine @xmath35 from the distributions obtained on finite lattices .    in order to calculate the probability distribution @xmath36",
    ", one has to simulate the su(3 ) pure gauge theory at the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "but because of eq .  [ eq : capwav ] any standard local updating algorithm will have autocorrelation times @xmath37 which increase exponentially with @xmath29 ( `` supercritical slowing down '' ) .",
    "the use of the multicanonical algorithm reduces this effect considerably .",
    "in order to overcome the supercritical slowing down , the multicanonical algorithm @xcite does not sample the configurations with the canonical boltzmann weight @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the wilson action in four dimensions , but rather with a modified weight @xmath40 the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 are chosen such that the probability @xmath30 ( not to be confused with the boltzmann weights ) is increased for all values of the action corresponding to the region between @xmath43 , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmc ] .",
    "details are described in @xcite where the efficiency of the multicanonical algorithm for su(3 ) pure gauge theory has been demonstrated .",
    "we apply the algorithm to the determination of the interfacial free energy .",
    "we have determined the probability distributions for @xmath2 and the spatial volumes @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath46 otherwise .",
    "[ fig : interface ] shows the real part of @xmath47 for a typical configuration close to @xmath31 on a @xmath48 lattice .    as expected from section [ interfacial ]",
    ", one can identify two interfaces between the confined phase and the deconfined phase .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath49 is always zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] the resulting probability distributions are shown .",
    "in contrast to the distributions for cubic volumes ( @xmath50 values as before ) they all have a region of constant probability in between the two peaks . this supports the scenario developped in section  [ interfacial ] .    in order to extract the interface tension",
    "we evaluate the quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "note that one expects @xmath54 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "[ eq : capwav ] both quantities should be linear functions of @xmath55 .",
    "their intercept with the @xmath56-axis is @xmath35 .",
    "we extract @xmath57 and @xmath58 from the probability distributions of fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fl ] together with the corresponding linear fits . for the interface tension",
    "we get the value @xmath59 it agrees within errors with the value obtained by replacing the polyakov line by the action density .",
    "the agreement with @xcite is good while @xcite quotes a slightly higher value .",
    "still the discrepency between these results and @xcite which used binder s histogram method for cubic volumes is reduced considerably and can thus be attributed mainly to interfacial interactions ."
