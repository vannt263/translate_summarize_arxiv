    "it is well known that the parent compounds of the cuprate superconductors are antiferromagnetic insulators .",
    "when holes are doped into the ubiquitous cuo@xmath0 planes , antiferromagnetic spin correlations survive and coexist with superconductivity . the nature of the magnetic correlations in the superconducting phases has been the subject of continuing controversy .",
    "the presence of the dynamical antiferromagnetism is believed by many to have a connection with the unusual transport properties of the cuprates .",
    "neutron scattering experiments have played a crucial role in characterizing the spin correlations in the cuprates .",
    "results are often discussed in terms of specific theories , so that particular interpretations of data can become too closely associated with certain theories .",
    "this is unfortunate , as there is quite a bit of unambiguous information that one can extract directly from the neutron scattering results .",
    "when combined with complementary experimental data and rather general theoretical arguments , a striking picture of the spin and charge correlations within the cuo@xmath0 planes emerges .",
    "my plan of attack is as follows .",
    "the implications of the modulated charge and spin order observed in la@xmath1nd@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 will be discussed first .",
    "next , comparisions with la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 , and then yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath7 will be made .",
    "a consideration of the effects of zn - doping follows .",
    "i conclude with a brief apology to theorists .",
    "the variation of the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath8 , vs.  @xmath9 in la@xmath1nd@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 is similar to that in la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 , except that there is a strong depression of @xmath8 for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "neutron diffraction measurements @xcite on single crystals with @xmath11 have demonstrated the existence of two kinds of incommensurate superlattice peaks , as illustrated in fig .",
    "magnetic peaks are displaced from the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath12 by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "( wave vectors are specified in reciprocal lattice units , based on a real - space unit cell with axes * a * and * b * parallel to the cu - o bonds . ) superlattice peaks split by an amount @xmath16 about fundamental bragg points provide evidence for charge ordering .",
    "( the charge order is detected indirectly through nuclear displacements , but the same is generally true in x - ray diffraction studies of charge order , as well . ) the charge - order peaks appear at a higher temperature than the magnetic peaks , as has recently been confirmed by x - ray scattering measurements with 100  kev x - rays @xcite .",
    "let us consider just the magnetic peaks for a moment .",
    "the appearance of peaks split in 2 orthogonal directions suggests 2 possibilities [ see fig .",
    "1(b , c ) ] : 1 ) there are 2 types of twin domains , each with a unique modulation wave vector , or 2 ) there is a single type of domain with a superposition of 2 orthogonal modulations . in the latter case , one would expect to see extra magnetic peaks with splittings such as @xmath17 , whereas shamoto _",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated the absence of intensity at such positions . besides this",
    ", there are other arguments that favor case ( 1 ) .",
    "first of all , the individual cuo@xmath0 layers in the low - temperature phase of la@xmath18nd@xmath2sr@xmath19cuo@xmath4 have 2-fold , but not 4-fold , symmetry , which would certainly be compatible with a uniaxial modulation .",
    "the symmetry - lowering distortion rotates by 90@xmath20 from one layer to the next , thus forcing equal populations of the two types of domains .",
    "secondly , a similar charge and spin ordering in hole - doped la@xmath0nio@xmath4 has been shown to have a single modulation wave vector @xcite .",
    "finally , singly - modulated phases are quite common in nature @xcite , whereas doubly - modulated phases are not .",
    "next , there is the question of the type of spin modulation . in general",
    ", there could be a modulation of the spin direction , the spin amplitude , or a combination of the two .",
    "the existence of the charge modulation implies that there must be a modulation of the spin amplitude .",
    "also , the modulation in the case of hole - doped la@xmath0nio@xmath4 appears to involve only the spin amplitude @xcite .",
    "thus , there must be a modulation of the spin amplitude , although a component involving spin rotation is not ruled out .",
    "considering the spin- and charge - density modulations together , missing pieces of information are the phases of the modulations with respect to the lattice .",
    "it is not clear that the absolute phases are of crucial importance . of greater interest",
    "is the relative phase between the two modulations . given that the parent compound is an antiferromagnet , it seems most likely that the maxima of the charge - density modulation ( corresponding to the greatest density of dopant - induced holes ) should be aligned with the nodes of the magnetic modulation .",
    "in fact , it is difficult to think of a scenario in which this would not be the case .    to determine the significance of the modulations",
    ", it is necessary to evaluate their amplitudes . of perhaps greatest interest",
    "is the amplitude of the charge modulation .",
    "one would like to know what fraction of the average hole density is spatially modulated : all or a tiny part ?",
    "unfortunately , neutron diffraction can not provide any direct information on this matter .",
    "instead , we must focus on the amplitude of the spin modulation . here",
    "the issue is complicated by the fact that zero - point spin fluctuations can have a significant impact on the amplitude .",
    "an estimate from measurements on an @xmath11 crystal , taking into account the lack of long - range order , yielded an amplitude of @xmath21  @xmath22 per cu ion @xcite .",
    "analysis of muon - spin - relaxation ( @xmath23sr ) measurements on a similar crystal gives the somewhat larger value of @xmath24  @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this latter value and the observed transition temperature ( @xmath25  k from @xmath23sr ) appear to be consistent with the empirical curve obtained when the staggered magnetization for a series of quasi-1d and 2d antiferromagnetic insulators is plotted versus @xmath26 @xcite , where @xmath27 is the nel temperature and @xmath28 is the superexchange energy .",
    "similarly , the amplitude of the spin - density modulation in la@xmath0nio@xmath29 is @xmath30 of that found in antiferromagnetic la@xmath0nio@xmath4 .",
    "the substantial spin - density amplitudes in these systems indicates a significant modulation of the hole density .",
    "any deviation from a sinusoidal modulation would be reflected in the appearance of finite intensity at higher - harmonic superlattice positions .",
    "for example , one would expect magnetic scattering to appear at positions separated by @xmath31 from the antiferromagnetic point .",
    "such features have been measured in la@xmath0nio@xmath32 @xcite . in that case , although the intensity pattern of the harmonics is quantitatively consistent with a model of relatively squared - off magnetic domains , the strongest higher harmonic ( the @xmath33 ) is only 1.5%  of the @xmath34 @xcite . in the case of the cuprates ,",
    "such a weak harmonic would be quite difficult to detect above the background .",
    "furthermore , transverse fluctuations of the spin and charge densities would likely damp out the harmonics .",
    "finally , we need to consider what is driving the modulated order .",
    "experimentally , it is observed that the charge - order peaks appear at a higher temperature than the magnetic peaks @xcite .",
    "the significance of this result can be evaluated in terms of a landau model , which takes into account only the symmetries of the system @xcite .",
    "comparison with the phase diagram of the landau model @xcite indicates that it is the charge density that is driving the order .",
    "charge - driven ordering is also observed in hole - doped la@xmath0nio@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "( if the driving force were associated with the spin density , then the charge and spin ordering temperatures would have to be identical , as found in the case of cr @xcite . )",
    "furthermore , the order of the transitions corresponds to the region of the phase diagram where only an amplitude - modulated spin density is allowed .",
    "to summarize , the following picture of the charge and spin modulations emerges from an examination of the experimental data , especially when combined with simple theoretical arguments and analogies to related compounds .",
    "the free energy associated with the dopant - induced hole density drives the ordering , resulting in a substantial real - space modulation of the hole density .",
    "once the hole density has ordered , the cu spins in the hole - poor regions can order in a manner that is locally antiferromagnetic , but which flips its phase by @xmath35 on crossing a maximum of the hole - density .",
    "the cuprate system in which incommensurate scattering was first observed is , of course , la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "although in this case the reported scattering is essentially all inelastic , for a given sr content @xmath9 the peak splitting @xmath36 @xcite is essentially identical to that found in the nd - doped case @xcite ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "superconductivity coexists with the incommensurate spin correlations in both systems @xcite , but @xmath8 is strongly depressed when the correlations have a static component .",
    "given the similar * q * dependence of the magnetic scattering and the associated superconductivity in the two systems , it seems clear that the spin correlations must have the same fundamental nature .",
    "it follows that , since the modulated antiferromagnetism in the nd - doped system is driven by the spatially oscillating hole density , a dynamic charge modulation is implied in the case of la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 .",
    "a wider range of sr concentrations has been studied in the system without nd , and the variation of @xmath36 with @xmath9 shows an interesting trend . for @xmath37 , @xmath36 initially increases linearly with @xmath9 before saturating for @xmath38 @xcite . since @xmath36 is proportional to the inverse of the charge modulation period , the @xmath39 behavior suggests that the amplitude of the charge modulation remains constant while the period decreases with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "( a very similar trend is observed in hole - doped la@xmath0nio@xmath4 @xcite . )",
    "this is consistent with an effective segregation of the doped holes , such that an initially antiferromagnetic cuo@xmath0 plane is broken up into antiferromagnetic strips , with the strips becoming narrower as the hole density increases .",
    "( at small @xmath9 , the pinning of holes by the randomly distributed dopants dominates @xcite and inhibits any well - defined periodic charge modulation .",
    "the effect of pinning by sr ions is even greater in la@xmath5sr@xmath3nio@xmath4 @xcite . )",
    "the saturation of @xmath36 for @xmath38 clearly indicates that the period of the modulation remains constant in that region , even though the charge density continues to increase .",
    "are there big differences between samples with and without nd doping ?",
    "not really .",
    "the main effect of the nd , which has the same valence as la , is associated with its small ionic radius relative to sr .",
    "its presence induces a change from the usual low - temperature - orthorhombic ( lto ) phase to the low - temperature - tetragonal ( ltt ) phase below about 70  k @xcite , similar to the transition first observed in la@xmath40ba@xmath19cuo@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two structures involves a subtle variation in the tilt pattern of cuo@xmath41 octahedra .",
    "the atomic displacement pattern in the ltt phase is compatible with a coupling to the charge modulation , and hence with static charge order . in la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 , the phonon associated with the same displacement pattern is quite soft ( @xmath42  mev @xcite ) , so that it is possible that a charge modulation , though not static , could be slowly fluctuating with the lattice vibrations .",
    "the picture of antiferromagnetic strips interacting weakly across hole - rich domain walls suggests that the spin excitations would be modified in a modest way relative to those in the parent compound .",
    "indeed , inelastic neutron scattering measurements on stripe - ordered la@xmath0nio@xmath32 indicate the low - energy spin excitations disperse away from the incommensurate peak positions with an effective spin - wave velocity that is 60%  of that in undoped la@xmath0nio@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such a renormalization can be understood in large part as occuring due to the reduction in the average number of nearest - neighbor spins to which there is a strong coupling @xmath28 , with no significant change in @xmath28 .",
    "inelastic measurements on la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 @xcite appear to be compatible with such a picture @xcite .",
    "a reduced dispersion , limited by a finite correlation length , is observed at low energies @xcite , while high - energy measurements indicate that the maximum excitation frequency is reduced by about 20%  relative to la@xmath0cuo@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath7 , the antiferromagnetic spin correlations become completely dynamic for @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "although most neutron scattering studies have detected a dynamical spin susceptibility that is peaked commensurately at the antiferromagnetic wave vector , the * q * width of the scattering measured for @xmath44  mev increases roughly linearly with @xmath9 @xcite , in a manner similar to the variation of @xmath36 with @xmath9 in la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 .",
    "the * q * dependence of the line shape for the low - energy range and @xmath450.6 has been shown to be more complex than a simple commensurately - centered gaussian @xcite .",
    "recently it was pointed out that the latter results can be modelled in a fashion similar to the incommensurate excitations in la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 if one allows for a shorter spin - spin correlation length @xcite .    in a new study of a crystal of yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath46 with @xmath47  k , bourges _",
    "_ @xcite have extended inelastic scattering measurements up to excitation energies of 120  mev . in this good superconductor",
    "they have detected distinct spin excitations that are very similar to the acoustic and optic spin - wave modes observed previously in antiferromagnetic yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at energies @xmath49  mev the excitations show an apparent dispersion with a velocity @xmath50%  of that found in the antiferromagnetic .",
    "this renormalization is quite similar to that found in the doped - nickelate case @xcite .",
    "the close connection between the spin excitations in the superconducting and antiferromagnetic yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath7 suggests that they are caused by similar clusters of antiferromagnetically correlated cu spins , and the existence of such clusters in the superconducting sample requires a spatial segregation of the doped holes .",
    "dai , mook , and doan @xcite have just reported evidence for incommensurate magnetic fluctuations in yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath51 with @xmath52  k. the incommensurability is observed in both energy - integrated scans and constant-@xmath53 scans at @xmath54 and 27  mev .",
    "it is suggested that the modulation direction is parallel to the antiferromagnetic wave vector ( i.e. , rotated by 45@xmath20 relative to the la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 case ) .",
    "these results appear to provide a very direct connection between the spin correlations in superconducting yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath7 and la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 .",
    "so far , i have presented arguments that neutron scattering studies indicate an intrinsic segregation of doped holes in the form of a periodic density modulation within the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then one might expect that , besides special modifications of the crystal structure , there would be other ways to pin the charge and spin modulations .",
    "indeed , light doping with zn appears to be another such way .",
    "koike _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that sustitution of 1%  zn for cu in la@xmath5sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 is sufficient to cause a drastic dip in @xmath8 as a function of @xmath9 , with the minimum occurring at @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting phase diagram looks reminiscent of that for nd - doped samples @xcite , except for the lack of evidence for a change in lattice distortion .",

    "zn - doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath7 samples with a range of oxygen concentrations have also been studied by neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to the 214 case : zn - doping does not modify the * q * dependence of the scattering , but it shifts spectral weight from higher energies to the low - energy region .",
    "it is rather interesting to note that the effect of zn on the superconducting cuprates is empirically quite similar to the effect of zn - doping on spin - ladder and spin - peierls compounds @xcite .",
    "both of the latter systems , without zn , have energy gaps in their spin excitations .",
    "very small amounts of zn cause the coexistence of excitations within the gap and even local antiferromagnetic order .",

    "i hope that i have persuaded the reader that la@xmath1nd@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 , rather than being a pebble in the collective shoe on the long march toward an understanding of the cuprates , is actually a rosetta stone for deciphering the experiments .",
