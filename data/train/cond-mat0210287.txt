    "the question of how superconductivity is affected by small sample size , raised already by anderson in 1959@xcite , has experienced a recent revival of interest , which started with the experimental work of ralph , black and tinkham@xcite . in these experiments",
    "it was shown that small superconducting grains , with size much smaller than the coherence length , but level spacing @xmath0 smaller than the bulk gap @xmath1 , have a gap of order @xmath2 in their tunneling spectrum , and grains in the regime @xmath3 ( to be called `` ultrasmall '' regime ) do not .",
    "since the pairing parameter is the basic quantity in bulk superconductivity , several efforts have been made to define pairing parameters which are relevant in the regime of small grains@xcite , and reduce to @xmath1 in the bulk limit .",
    "the need for such new definitions arises for two apparent reasons : ( i ) for ultrasmall grains , in which @xmath4 , the quantity @xmath1 has no direct physical meaning ; ( ii ) in both ultrasmall grains , and small grains for which @xmath5 , if the grains are isolated the appropriate ensemble is the canonical one , in which the usual definition of @xmath1 that is used in the grand canonical ensemble [ see @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ deltagc ] ) ] is trivially zero . in this paper",
    "we show that there is a third , fundamental reason for the inadequacy of @xmath6 to describe pairing correlations in small superconducting grains .",
    "unlike the situation in bulk superconductors , in which all the various superconducting properties can be characterized by one energy scale , @xmath1 , in general there exist two distinct energy scales that characterize pairing correlations , and the difference between them becomes important particularly for small grains .",
    "the first such energy scale , which we denote by @xmath7 , characterizes single - particle properties , such as excitation energies and even - odd effects .",
    "the second , denoted as @xmath8 , characterizes cumulative properties , such as the condensation energy [ see eqs .",
    "( [ condensationdelta ] ) ,  ( [ continuouslambda ] ) ] , to which pairing correlations of all the levels up to @xmath9 contribute .",
    "the reason why these two scales are in general distinct is that levels far from the fermi energy , namely those with energy @xmath10 between @xmath1 and the debye frequency @xmath9 ( to be called `` not condensed '' or `` far '' levels ) , make a more significant contribution to cumulative properties than to single - particle ones .",
    "( for a discussion on the role of the far levels in superconducting grains and persistent currents in normal metal rings see refs .  ) .",
    "the contribution of the far levels to physical properties turns out to be proportional to the level spacing ; in the large grain limit where the level spacing becomes exceedingly small , this contribution can thus be neglected . in this limit ,",
    "the single - particle and cumulative properties are therefore both determined by the correlations of only the `` condensed levels '' , i.e.  those within @xmath1 of @xmath11 , so that the two scales @xmath8 and @xmath7 become identical .",
    "previous attempts@xcite to define , in terms of pair correlation functions , a pairing parameter adequate to describe small grains in the canonical ensemble resulted in parameters characterizing cumulative properties of the grain , but not single particle ones .",
    "we shall discuss a particular definition for such a cumulative parameter , denoted @xmath8 , which is purposefully chosen such that @xmath8 reduces to @xmath1 in the bulk limit .",
    "for small grains , we show the correspondence of this definition to cumulative properties such as the condensation energy .",
    "we then define a single - particle parameter @xmath7 and show the correspondence of this definition to single - particle properties of the grain . in the bulk limit both @xmath8 and @xmath7",
    "reduce to @xmath1 as expected , but at a different size scale ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "for the single - particle properties , we find @xmath12 in the ultrasmall regime ( @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 for larger grains .",
    "in contrast , for the cumulative properties we find @xmath15 not only in the ultrasmall regime , but also in an `` intermediate regime''@xcite in which @xmath16 . regarding the relation between cumulative and single - particle parameters , we find @xmath17 in both the ultrasmall and the intermediate regimes .",
    "note that both the range of the intermediate regime , and the value of the pairing parameters and the various superconducting properties obtained below , depend explicitly on @xmath9 .",
    "this @xmath9-dependence , as well as the very existence of the intermediate regime , are direct manifestations of the contribution of the pairing correlations of the far levels .",
    "finally , we discuss some possible strategies for measuring the single - particle and cumulative quantities in small grains . throughout the paper , except when discussing the even - odd effect , we assume for simplicity an even number of electrons in the grain .",
    "we consider the reduced bcs hamiltonian @xmath18 where the second sum ( the pairing interaction ) is restricted to energies within @xmath9 of @xmath11 , and @xmath19 denote spin up ( down ) .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is the usual bcs hamiltonian used when discussing superconducting grains  @xcite and its validity is discussed in , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "for a grain with a given , finite number of electrons this hamiltonian has an exact solution , obtained by richardson@xcite , and independently by gaudin@xcite . in the macroscopic limit , where the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles produce the same results , richardson s solution reduces to the bcs solution@xcite . as a result of the pairing interaction ,",
    "the ground state of a superconductor is different from the noninteracting fermi state .",
    "it is a coherent superposition of various paired many - body noninteracting states , defined as slater determinant of real one electron wavefunctions .",
    "the coherence means that the amplitudes for all these states in the superposition are real , up to an overall , global phase factor .",
    "this is true both for the bcs wave function in the grand canonical formalism    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , and for the exact wave function given by richardson s solution@xcite .",
    "( in the grand canonical formalism , the above coherence relates to noninteracting many - body states with a given number of pairs .",
    "one can add a constant phase between states of different number of pairs , which is referred to as the superconducting phase ) .",
    "a particular characteristic of the structure of the ground state of a superconductor is that the occupation probability of levels above the fermi energy is _ nonzero _ , and that of levels below the fermi energy is smaller than unity . a measure of the pairing correlations , which exploits both the non fermi like occupation probability and the phase coherence mentioned above , is given by the pair amplitude , which in the g.c . ensemble is given by    @xmath22    for any many - body bcs - like eigenstate , characterized by the set @xmath23 of the occupation probabilities of the bcs quasiparticles , one obtains@xcite    @xmath24    specifically , for the ground state given in eq .  ( [ bcswf ] ) , for which @xmath25 for all @xmath26 , we obtain    @xmath27    which gives in the bulk limit @xmath28",
    ". the mean occupation of level @xmath26 is given by @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "note that the nature of @xmath6 is cumulative , being a sum of the contributions of all levels . as a result of the phase coherence mentioned above , all the contributions to the sum in eq .",

    "we now turn to the definition of the cumulative canonical pairing parameter .",
    "a natural extension of the concept of long range order in the bulk , suggests the following definition for a canonical pairing parameter :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is a function characterizing pairing correlations , which is given by    @xmath40    we will show that this definition for the cumulative canonical pairing parameter is adequate , as it has the following properties : ( i ) it is meaningful for a canonical ensemble ; ( ii ) in the bulk limit it is equivalent to the grand canonical definition ( [ deltagc ] ) _ for any given bcs eigenstate ; _ ( iii ) it is related to the condensation energy and to the mean occupation of the noninteracting levels not only in the bulk limit , but also in the opposite limit of ultrasmall grains [ see eqs .",
    "( [ condensationdelta][deltaoccupation ] ) below ] .    expanding each of the @xmath41 operators in the basis of the noninteracting single - particle eigenstates , we obtain    @xmath42    since the terms in each of the brackets",
    "are number conserving , they are meaningful in the canonical ensemble , which is used below for the evaluation of @xmath43 for small grains . however , in the macroscopic limit , one can use the grand canonical ensemble to evaluate @xmath43 within the bcs approximation . by using the bogoliubov transformation and the bcs wavefunctions",
    ", we find that for any many - body bcs - like eigenstate    @xmath44    where the last equality is a result of eq .",
    "( [ bulklimitdelta ] ) .",
    "the canonical pairing parameter is equal , in the bulk limit , to the grand canonical pairing parameter for any many - body state , and therefore both definitions are equivalent in this limit . our definition for @xmath8 differs slightly from that given in ref .",
    "the difference lies in the last term in eq .",
    "( [ deltacano ] ) , which results in the exact equivalence to @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ bulklimit ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the opposite limit of ultrasmall grains . by examining richardson s exact solution@xcite ,",
    "it was shown that pairing correlations , however small [ i.e.  even for @xmath45 manifest themselves both in the form of the ground state wave function and in a finite condensation energy @xmath46@xcite . here",
    "we make the connection between these two effects and the canonical pairing parameter .",
    "in particular , we shall show that to leading order in @xmath47    @xmath48    where @xmath43 is evaluated for the exact ground state ( this result differs from the known bulk result @xmath49 by the occurrence of @xmath47 in the denominator , which is discussed below ) .",
    "also , @xmath8 is related to the sum of the pairing correlations in all the levels , as are reflected in their occupation probabilities , since we shall show that    @xmath50    where    @xmath51    with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the quantity @xmath54 , which has been defined in analogy to @xmath6 , reflects the non - fermi - like mean occupation probability in the many - body ground state of the noninteracting single - particle levels .",
    "these results are found as follows : to obtain the value of @xmath43 in the ground state we use richardson s equations and expressions for the wavefunctions @xcite , to write the ground state to leading order in @xmath47 , in terms of the amplitudes of the various noninteracting many - body states appearing in it :    @xmath55    the first line refers to the amplitude that all the levels below the fermi energy are occupied by pairs ( noninteracting ground state of the system ) .",
    "the second line is the amplitude for the noninteracting many - body state which is the same as the noninteracting ground state , except for one pair excitation from level @xmath26 to level @xmath56 .",
    "the amplitudes of all the other many - body noninteracting states are zero to first order in @xmath47 .    from eq .",
    "( [ gswf ] ) , to zeroth order in @xmath47 , the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ deltacano ] ) cancel each other . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ deltacano ] ) has no contribution to first order in @xmath47 .",
    "the contribution to the first term which is first order in @xmath47 comes from the fact that there is finite amplitude for levels above the fermi energy to be occupied , and is given , using eq .",
    "( [ gswf ] ) , by @xmath57 for each @xmath58 ( by @xmath59 we refer to levels below ( above ) the fermi energy ) . since the sum in eq .",
    "( [ deltacano ] ) is unrestricted , we get a factor of two , and to leading order in @xmath47    @xmath60    the condensation energy was calculated in ref .  .",
    "in order to compare it with @xmath8 of eq .",
    "( [ deltacanfirstlambda ] ) we present here its value for a general spectrum , which to leading order in @xmath47 is given by    @xmath61    this result is obtained directly from richardson s equations , and leads to eq .",
    "( [ condensationdelta ] ) .",
    "evaluating eq .",
    "( [ deltacanfirstlambda ] ) for equally - spaced spectrum , we obtain    @xmath62    the large magnitude ( linear in @xmath9 ) of this result is due to the fact that all the amplitudes in ( [ gswf ] ) have the same phase ( which is a consequence of the coherence discussed in sec .",
    "[ sectwo ] ) , so that all the terms in eq .",
    "( [ deltacanfirstlambda ] ) are added with the same sign .    in ref .",
    "we have shown that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the contribution of the condensed levels , and @xmath65 is the contribution of the far ( not - condensed ) levels , which can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "similarly , @xmath43 is a sum of the contributions of all levels below @xmath9 , too , and is related to the condensation energy in both the bcs and the perturbative regimes .",
    "therefore , it is natural to hypothesize that @xmath43 ( similarly to @xmath46 ) can to a good approximation be written as the sum of a bulk contribution from the condensed levels and a perturbative contribution from the far levels , i.e.  @xmath66 .",
    "this would imply that @xmath15 in both the ultrasmall and intermediate regimes ( see fig  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "note , that the expression for the condensation energy in eq .",
    "( [ condensationdelta ] ) is different from the bulk expression of the condensation energy in terms of @xmath1 , namely @xmath67 , by a factor of @xmath47 in the denominator .",
    "since we have shown that in the bulk limit @xmath68 , we conclude that @xmath8 and the condensation energy have a different functional dependence on @xmath47 .",
    "the above hypothesis results in    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is a monotonic function of @xmath47 , which equals @xmath47 for @xmath71 and unity for @xmath72 ( bulk limit ) .    we now turn to derive the relation ( [ deltaoccupation ] ) between @xmath8 and the mean occupation probabilities . in the exact ground state , @xmath73 is given by    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is any configuration of @xmath76 levels out of the @xmath77 noninteracting single - particle levels , that includes the level @xmath26 .",
    "to leading order in @xmath47 , using eq .",
    "( [ gswf ] ) , we obtain for levels @xmath26 above @xmath11    @xmath78    using the approximation of constant level spacing , we find that    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is measured from the fermi energy .",
    "this important result shows that the mean occupation @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath82 , unlike the usual bcs result , where for @xmath83 the mean occupation is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "since the occupation probability for a single level is , by ( [ vjconstls ] ) , proportional to the level spacing , this term can be neglected in the bulk limit . however , in finite - size grains , we find that in both the ultrasmall _ and intermediate _ regimes ( i.e.   @xmath85 ) , the occupation probability for energies of the order of @xmath9 is in fact larger than that given by the bcs approximation .    as a result of eq .",
    "( [ vjexplicit ] ) , to first order in @xmath47 we find that @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "for equally spaced levels , one therefore obtains from eq .",
    "( [ vjconstls ] ) that    @xmath88    which yields the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath8 given in eq .",
    "( [ deltaoccupation ] ) . to summarize : the condensation energy , pairing parameter , and mean level occupation all receive significant contributions from the weak pairing correlation of the far ( `` not - condensed '' ) levels up to the debye frequency .",
    "as a result , their magnitude is much larger than that given by the bcs approximation , not only in the ultrasmall regime , but also in the intermediate regime where @xmath89 .",
    "unlike the cumulative properties considered above , other superconducting properties , such as the excitation energy and the even - odd effect ( quantified by the matveev  larkin ( ml ) parameter , see ref .  )",
    ", are related to the blocking of , say , only one or two levels to pairing correlations .",
    "therefore , they do not depend on the correlations between all possible pairs of levels in the grain , but only on the correlations between these selected levels and all the other levels . as a result , _",
    "their values in small grains are much smaller than one would get by using the bulk analogy with @xmath91 as the pairing parameter_. we therefore define    @xmath92    where the sum is over the noninteracting single - particle levels and @xmath93 is a selected such level .",
    "since one frequently deals with the lowest energy levels , we define    @xmath94    for @xmath95 being the level closest to the fermi energy ( for our considerations the cases that @xmath95 is below or above @xmath96 are equivalent , and we take @xmath95 to be below @xmath11 ) .    in the bulk limit , using the bcs approximation , we obtain for the ground state    @xmath97    and specifically @xmath98 we now turn to the ultrasmall regime , and evaluate @xmath7 in the ground state to second order in @xmath47 . using eq .",
    "( [ gswf ] ) we obtain    @xmath99    and for the equally spaced spectrum    @xmath100    let us now consider the excitation energy , say @xmath101 , of the first excited state of an ( even ) superconducting grain",
    ". this state can be described by having the two levels nearest to @xmath11 singly occupied with probability unity , thus breaking one pair , and the other @xmath102 pairs occupying the remaining @xmath103 levels according to richardson s exact solution @xcite .",
    "the excitation energy has two different contributions .",
    "( i ) the kinetic energy cost @xmath0 of occupying a level of higher energy with probability unity , and ( ii ) a pairing energy cost , which is given by @xmath7 . note that the latter has ( iia ) a diagonal part , given by @xmath104 , which is related to the excess energy of two electrons occupying the same spatial noninteracting eigenstate , and ( iib ) an off - diagonal part due to the blocking of the two singly occupied levels to pairing correlations . adding these contributions",
    "gives    @xmath105    where the last expression is valid for a grain with equally spaced spectrum .",
    "similarly , the ml parameter@xcite is given by    @xmath106    note that the pairing contribution to the energy cost of the first excitation equals @xmath107 in the bulk limit , whereas it equals @xmath7 in an ultrasmall grain , and the same factor of two appears in the ml parameter .",
    "this reflects the fact that in the bulk limit each level is correlated with all the other levels , while in the ultrasmall grain , the dominant correlations are between levels on different sides of the fermi energy .",
    "a possible measurement of the cumulative correlations of a superconducting grain was discussed in ref .  .",
    "it was shown that the condensation energy can be obtained from specific heat or spin magnetization measurements , where an explicit calculation was done for the latter .    in distinction with the case of bulk superconductivity , where the single - particle properties are easiest to measure through the lowest excitations of the system , in small grains",
    "the energy of the first excited state is given by eq .",
    "( [ fexc ] ) , in which @xmath7 is only a small correction to the level spacing .",
    "matveev and larkin suggested to measure their pairing parameter by the parity - induced alternation of coulomb blockade peak spacings in small grains .",
    "here we suggest the possibility that for an ensemble of small , weakly - coupled grains , @xmath7 could be measured through their spin magnetization as a function of magnetic field at zero temperature .",
    "we assume that the coupling between the grains is weak enough such that the equilibrium properties of the system can be approximated by summing over the individual grains , but strong enough so tunneling between grains in a large enough ensemble ( of say 50 grains ) occurs within the time of the experiment .    for a single - grain",
    ", the spin magnetization shows steps at values that correspond to the zeeman energy being equal the energy required to break a pair , of which the first is at @xmath108 [ by eq .",
    "( [ fexc ] ) ] , which is dominated by the large _ single - grain _ level spacing @xmath0 .",
    "in order to avoid having to worry about the latter , we consider an ensemble of weakly connected superconducting grains , which would have an effective joint level spacing @xmath109 that is much smaller than @xmath0 if the ensemble is large , @xmath110 ( we neglect the charging energy . note , that the charging energy was found to be much smaller@xcite than what naive estimates give .",
    "since the tunneling between the grains is weak , the relevant ensemble is the canonical one ) .",
    "then the ground state of the unconnected system is given by each of the grains having an even number of electrons , being in its ground state .",
    "the first excited state of the system is given by moving one electron between two grains , so that afterwards the first has a single - occupied level just below @xmath11 , and the second has a singly - occupied level just above @xmath11 .",
    "for a system of `` normal '' noninteracting grains the energy of such an excitation is of the order of the single - particle level spacing of the whole ensemble of grains , @xmath109 .",
    "however , in a system of ultrasmall superconducting grains , since two singly occupied levels are created in two different grains , the energy of such an excitation would be given by @xmath7 ( which is @xmath111 ) .",
    "since the first step in the spin magnetization is at the energy of the first excited state of the system , in such a measurement we predict a gap of value @xmath7 .",
    "( in a similar measurement in grains with @xmath112 , the measured gap would be given by @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath7 can be interpreted as the superconducting gap as measured by single particle properties . in principle , performing such a measurement as a function of the grain size would monitor the change of @xmath7 , from being much larger than @xmath1 for ultrasmall grains to equaling @xmath1 for large ones .",
    "note by that reducing the grain size one _ increases _ this gap @xmath7 .    finally , we would like to note that the logarithmic dependence of the correlation ( second ) term of @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ deltaspgses ] ) is manifested in the interaction correction to the ensemble averaged magnetic response of small metallic grains , when considered within the bcs model@xcite .",
    "we have shown that various superconducting properties can be classified to two groups , one containing those properties which are single particle in nature , and the other containing those properties which are cumulative , a result of the summed contributions of many levels .",
    "unlike the case in bulk superconductivity , where both these properties are characterized by one energy parameter @xmath1 , in general , and in particular in small grains , two different energy parameters , @xmath7 for the former group and @xmath8 for the latter one , characterize superconducting properties .    in bulk superconductivity",
    "the relevant contribution to the various superconducting properties comes from the `` condensed '' levels , within @xmath1 of @xmath11 .",
    "however , in small grains the contribution of all levels up to @xmath9 is significant , and this results in the existence of these two different parameters , as well as in the fact that @xmath113 in the ultrasmall regime and @xmath15 also in the intermediate regime . experimental possibilities to measure the two pairing parameters were discussed .",
