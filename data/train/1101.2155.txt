    "cosmological data ( apart @xmath7li abundance ) are nicely fitted by @xmath1cdm , a model which however has severe _ fine tuning _ and _ coincidence _ problems .",
    "here we therefore discuss an alternative easing these problems : that , symoultaneously , neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) have mass , and de is a scalar field @xmath8 self  interacting and interacting with cold dark matter ( cdm ) . to our knowledge , this is the only alternative whose likelihood , although marginally , exceeds @xmath1cdm .    an energy transfer from cdm to dark energy ( de ) causes significant distorsions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 spectra in respect to @xmath1cdm , but allows de to be a significant cosmic component since ever ; distortions are also caused by @xmath0 masses , in the range @xmath11  ev .",
    "these two distorsions tend however to compensate and compensation allows to fit data better than @xmath1cdm ( figure [ cmb ] shows this for cmb anisotropy spectrum ) .",
    "this yields models including a slight amount of hot dark matter ( typically @xmath12 ) ; they are then _ mildly mixed _ and _ coupled _ ( mmc ) models .",

    "rp ( sugra ) yields a smooth ( fast ) dependence of the de state parameter on redshift .",
    "for both potentials @xmath1 will be taken as a free parameter .",
    "once the density parameter of de is found , the valuse of @xmath21 is also uniquely defined .",
    "both these potentials also yield a dynamical rise from @xmath22@xmath23 to unity of the de / cdm ratio , at the eve of the present epoch , so easing coincidence as well . the natural scale for @xmath24",
    "is then @xmath22@xmath25 ; only in the presence of @xmath0 masses such range gets consistent with data .",
    "absolute @xmath0 masses can be measured through double beta decays ( @xmath26 ) or @xmath4h @xmath5 decay @xcite .",

    "this is the range of masses needed to balance de  cdm coupling , so yielding mmc models .",
