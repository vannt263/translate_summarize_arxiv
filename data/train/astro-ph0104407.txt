    "it is now known that star formation in starburst galaxies is not just a scaled - up version of quiescent star formation in normal galaxies . for example , the phenomenon of starbursts involves the formation of super star clusters ( sscs ) , which are believed to be the pre - cursors of the present - day globular clusters ( see recent review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these sscs may generate large - scale superwind outflows @xcite which can carry away a good fraction of the gas and processed heavy elements from the starburst region .",
    "star formation also occurs in the form of individual field stars and small unresolved clusters . along with stellar emission diagnostics , studies of ionized gas around ob stars",
    "provide information on the young stellar population and also characterizes the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "radio continuum and recombination line emissions are good extinction - free probes of this gas .",
    "high resolution radio continuum imaging of starburst centers , for example , has led to the discovery of a host of pc - sized thermal and non - thermal compact sources ( ngc 253 : @xcite and references therein ; ngc 2146 : @xcite ; m 82 : @xcite ; ngc 4038/9 : @xcite ) .",
    "studying the compact thermal sources is difficult in the uv , optical or even in ir , owing to extinction problems . a nebular diagnostic like radio recombination lines ( rrls )",
    "can probe thermal gas with large emission measures . in the cm - wavelength range",
    ", rrls have been shown to be detectable from nuclear starburst regions in a number of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "these lines have proven to be good probes of gas density , and are reliable estimators of ionized gas mass and the ionizing photon flux in these starburst regions .",
    "rrls have been studied in about 14 galaxies so far ( @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we present observations of the 92 rrl at 8.3 ghz from two prototypical blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcdgs ) , ngc 5253 and he 2 - 10 .",
    "bcdgs are dwarf galaxies which are dominated by an ongoing starburst , with or without a background quiescent star formation .",
    "ngc 5253 and he 2 - 10 are classic examples @xcite of bcdgs .",
    "ngc 5253 ( d=4.1 mpc , saha et al .",
    "1995 ) is a dwarf galaxy with an underlying elliptical structure @xcite .",
    "this galaxy has large scale ionized filaments @xcite and a number of young star clusters in the halo @xcite .",
    "the central kpc region is undergoing active star formation and hosts a number of sscs @xcite .",
    "wolf - rayet emission has been detected in the central region @xcite .",
    "based on modeling of the stellar emission and through the presence of ambient ionized gas and wolf - rayet features @xcite , a spatial age gradient in the star formation in the core has been inferred .",
    "ngc 5253 is notable for having a flat radio continuum spectrum @xcite , which is attributed to lack of non - thermal radiation due to the absence of supernova remnants .",
    "this absence is believed to be due to the very young age of the star formation activity .",
    "the resulting age estimate is consistent with that derived from optical and ir spectrophotometry @xcite .",
    "the structure in the inner 20is complex and there is evidence for a patchy dust distribution ( calzetti et al .",
    "1997 ; hereafter cmb97 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite , hereafter tbh00 , have made a high resolution image of the central region in the radio continuum at 15 and 22 ghz and have detected a compact source which they interpret as a surrounding a nascent ssc .",
    "he 2 - 10 ( d=9 mpc ) was the first wolf - rayet galaxy discovered @xcite .",
    "three star forming regions have been identified in the central part of the galaxy and among them , the central @xmath05region , called region ` a ' , is the youngest @xcite .",
    "this region exhibits predominant wolf - rayet spectral features and is also the most active star forming region .",
    "hst imaging in the uv has shown the presence of a series of young clusters , believed to be sscs @xcite .",
    "deep images of this galaxy @xcite indicate a large scale bipolar outflow of gas .",
    "molecular gas , imaged through co lines , shows a disturbed morphology with a rotating disk or a bar @xcite .",
    "radio continuum from he 2 - 10 has an overall spectral index of @xmath50.6 and is therefore dominated by non - thermal emission @xcite .",
    "recent high resolution radio continuum imaging by @xcite , hereafter kj99 , has shown the existence of five compact radio knots with flat spectra .",
    "these radio knots are interpreted by the authors as high density nebulae surrounding young sscs , which are probably totally obscured in the optical .",
    "based on their nuclear flux densities and the presence of active star formation in the central region , we selected these two galaxies to search for rrls from the central few hundred parsecs .",
    "our observations are a part of a program we have undertaken to detect rrls in nearby starbursts and to follow up the detected sources using multi - frequency rrl and continuum observations .",
    "the aim is to model the density structure , kinematics and geometry of the ionized gas in these regions and to determine an extinction - independent star formation rate .",
    "an example of such a study of arp 220 has been presented by @xcite .",
    "ngc 5253 and he 2 - 10 were observed with the very large array ( vla ) in both the cnb and the dnc configurations with an on - source integration time of 3 hours per source in each configuration .",
    "some details of the observations are given in table 1 .",
    "the system was tuned to detect the 92 line ( @xmath6=8309.385 mhz ) using a total bandwidth of 25 mhz and 15 spectral channels .",
    "data from both polarization channels were recorded .",
    "the data was hanning - smoothed offline to reduce the effects of gibbs ringing .",
    "the effective velocity resolution is 113 .",
    "the flux density scale was fixed by using 3c 286 as a calibrator and phase and bandpass calibrations were done by using a nearby point source .",
    "all the data analysis were done by using standard algorithms within the software aips .",
    "the continuum visibility data was self - calibrated and the resultant antenna gains were applied to the line data as well .",
    "the cnb and dnc array data of each galaxy were later concatenated and combined ( c+d ) continuum and line datasets ( with a resolution of @xmath05 ) were obtained .",
    "the final line images were derived after subtracting the continuum using the aips task uvlin which subtracts a linear function of frequency from the real and imaginary parts of the observed visibilities @xcite . the continuum and line data are presented in table 2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the continuum images of the two galaxies .",
    "the images show evidence for filaments , especially in the case of ngc 5253 , where there are extensions in the southern direction .",
    "these filaments are also seen in optical line and continuum images and extend out to a few arcminutes .",
    "the total continuum flux density of ngc 5253 at 8.3 ghz is 58 mjy .",
    "the radio spectrum of this galaxy is known to be flat from 1.4 ghz up to 23 ghz , based on both single - dish and scaled array vla observations ( see @xcite and also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "lower resolution images indicate that there is emission over at least 2 .",
    "the shortest spacing available in the d configuration of the vla implies that our images are not sensitive to structures on scales larger than @xmath02 .",
    "we estimate that the total flux density of ngc 5253 in our image is 80% of the single - dish flux density at 8.3 ghz . the radio continuum emission in ngc 5253 peaks around region ` a ' ( the cm - emission peak in turner , ho and beck 1998 ) which contains the two main star forming regions - clusters 4 and 5 ( cmb97 ) .",
    "the radio continuum emission is weak to the south of the peak , where the older clusters are believed to have dispersed the gas .",
    "the radio emission in he 2 - 10 covers the two main star forming regions - ` a ' and ` b ' ( region ` a ' is the central 6region and region ` b ' is the secondary star forming region 8.5east of ` a ' , @xcite ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the 92 line spectra of the two galaxies at the position of the peak continuum emission . the line emission in both the galaxies is spatially unresolved , even in the higher resolution c array data",
    "in this section , we model the observed data in terms of the local electron density , temperature and size of the ionized gas .",
    "the models for the ionized gas are based on the observed 92 line flux density and the continuum flux densities at 8.3 ghz , 4.8 ghz and 15 ghz ( see table 2 ) from the region of rrl emission . since the line formation process is dependent on the geometry of the emitting gas , we consider four different models .",
    "model i is for a single spherical hii region of fixed size and constant density .",
    "model ii consists of a uniform slab of constant density , and fixed thickness and beam filling factor .",
    "model iii consists of a collection of hii regions , of fixed density and size .",
    "the number of such hii regions is normalized using the observed line flux density .",
    "the third model is similar to those described by @xcite and further adapted by @xcite and @xcite for modeling rrls from ionized gas in starburst regions .",
    "for all three models , a parameter search is done in density in the range 10@xmath7 @xmath8  n@xmath9 and size @xmath10 in the range 0.01 pc @xmath8 @xmath10 @xmath8 l pc , where l is the upper limit to the size of the line emitting region given by the beam size , which is 150 pc for ngc 5253 and 315 pc for he 2 - 10 .",
    "model ii also includes the beam filling factor as a free parameter , which is the lateral extent of the slab of ionized gas within the region of total lateral size l pc .",
    "we also consider a fourth model ( model iv ) in which the co - existence of multiple densities is assumed . in this model , we assume a population of hii regions with different densities , but with each hii region having a constant density .",
    "we consider those densities which correspond to compact ( n@xmath1110@xmath12 and diameter d between 0.1 and 1 pc ) and ultracompact hii regions ( n@xmath1110@xmath1 and d@xmath130.1 pc ) .",
    "a hii region of density is assigned a size @xmath10 given by the relation = c@xmath14 .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 and c@xmath16 depend on the ambient medium and the evolutionary phase of the hii region . in our model , these are free parameters .",
    "there is evidence for the existence of such a power law for galactic compact and ultracompact hii regions ( see , for example , habing and israel 1979 or garay et al .",
    "the population of hii regions of various densities is described by a power - law distribution function , n(n@xmath17 ) @xmath18 n@xmath19 , which is normalized by the observed line flux density .",
    "the distribution function for galactic diffuse hii regions is a power law @xcite .",
    "@xcite found evidence for a power law luminosity function for galactic ultracompact hii regions , although @xcite claim a peaked distribution function .",
    "the actual form of the distribution would depend in detail on the star formation history of the starburst region as well as on the evolution of the hii regions . in the model , we use as a free parameter .",
    "the fourth free parameter in model iv is n@xmath20 , the minimum density in a given distribution .    the observed data was modeled using models i through iv .",
    "valid solutions are identified as those combinations of free parameters which produce both the observed 92 line as well as free - free emission at 4.8 , 8.3 and 15 ghz less than the corresponding total observed continuum flux densities ( which would include both thermal and non - thermal components ) .",
    "the gas mass and the ionizing photon flux were also derived for each valid solution .",
    "all solutions were computed for t@xmath17 = 10000 and 12500 k. these high temperatures have been derived from optical spectroscopy and are consistent with the low metallicity of these two galaxies @xcite .",
    "model results for the two galaxies are summarized in tables 3 and 4 . since models",
    "i and ii give similar results , they are grouped together .",
    "the allowed range of values of densities and sizes of ionized gas are listed .",
    "the range of densities and sizes allowed by the models are quite limited .",
    "the gas properties for the models with the minimum allowed value of are given in the lower half of tables 3 and 4 .",
    "the significance of the minimum allowed is as follows : for an arbitrary continuum optical depth @xmath21 , @xmath18 s@xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 , where s@xmath22 is the free - free radio continuum flux density .",
    "hence , for an observed value of s@xmath22 , the calculated value of the required ionizing photon flux increases with increasing continuum optical depth , @xmath21 .",
    "a given value of s@xmath22 thus implies a lower limit to the value of .",
    "we take the minimum consistent corresponding to the minimum consistent for modeling .",
    "the values for the derived parameters given in tables 3 and 4 correspond to the average of the range of values allowed by the n@xmath17-@xmath10 solutions .",
    "there are two classes of models allowed by the existing data : @xmath252500 , @xmath265 pc and @xmath272500 and @xmath2630 pc the model solutions are indicated in separate rows for each class of solutions .",
    "the predictions of some of the valid models for the free - free continuum and line flux densities as a function of frequency are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the calculated values of the free - free continuum flux densities are less than the observed total continuum flux densities ( which are marked as stars in the figure ) .",
    "the remaining continuum emission which is unaccounted for in our models will have contributions both from thermal continuum from any non - rrl emitting gas and also from the non - thermal continuum ( the latter , only in the case of he 2 - 10 , since ngc 5253 has very little contribution from non - thermal emission in the central region ) .",
    "if a significant amount of such a non - rrl emitting thermal gas is present , the amount of such gas will be strongly constrained by the continuum flux densities at @xmath281 ghz .",
    "all the above models will be referred to as ` low - resolution ' models since these models are based on data with a resolution of 5 , corresponding to a linear size of 150 pc for ngc 5253 and 315 pc for he 2 - 10 . in all four models , the favored parameters are densities of @xmath010@xmath1 , effective sizes of 3 - 8 pc and masses of ionized gas of @xmath010@xmath1 .",
    "tables 3 and 4 show that for both the galaxies , the four models give results which are consistent .",
    "but the minimum value of varies slightly among the various models .",
    "this variation is due to the different geometries assumed in the models and illustrates the uncertainities associated with modeling data with a limited angular resolution . in section 4 , we discuss the implications of these results of the models .",
    "as is well known , radio recombination line formation is a non - lte process .",
    "this property can be used to derive densities from observations if the geometry is known . from the theory of rrls ,",
    "it is known that a particular recombination line is most efficiently emitted from gas at a particular density and that gas at lower densities emits rrls preferrentially at lower frequencies and vice versa @xcite .",
    "this property of rrls ( as density filters ) implies that a particular recombination line would receive maximum contributions from a restricted range of gas densities .",
    "hence previous work which modeled single rrl data using the single - density approximation ( corresponding to models i , ii and iii in this work ) were reasonably successful @xcite .",
    "therefore , with multi - frequency rrl data , the gas can be modeled as a combination of a minimum number of distinct density components .",
    "this method was successfully employed to derive a three - density component model of the ionized gas in arp 220 based on line and continuum data from 1.4 ghz to 230 ghz @xcite .    however , the single - density approximation based on the above argument is valid only for certain functional dependences of emission measure on density ( i.e. , on the relative values of emission measures for gas at different densities : the line flux density is most strongly peaked as a function of density when @xmath29 + 2 + 3/@xmath15=0 . for the line intensity ,",
    "the condition is @xmath29 + 2 + 1/@xmath15=0 .",
    "see section 3 for definitions of and ) . for example , figure 4(a ) shows the dependence of the expected line intensity at 8.3 ghz as a function of density , for a constant em and the line strength does indeed have a peak as a function of electron density . on the other hand , if a statistically well - sampled population of hii regions with a power law distribution of em with density ( as in model iv ) is assumed , the line strength no longer peaks for a particular density , but instead , is a monotonic function of density .",
    "for example , it can be seen in figure 4(b ) that when is held constant ( i.e , em@xmath30n@xmath31 ) , the line intensity is no longer a peaked function of density .",
    "the results of model iv show that solutions exist only for values of n@xmath20 ranging between 2500 and 25000 .",
    "also , the solutions with the minimum values of ( the minimum value of which is consistent with the given data , corresponding to the minimum needed continuum optical depth , see section 3 for an explanation ) correspond to densities between 5000 and 10000 .",
    "though no upper limit to the density is imposed on the models , the nature of the allowed solutions is such that only gas of densities very close to n@xmath20 contributes to the line flux density and also absorbs almost all of the required ionizing uv photons , i.e. , all the higher density gas in the distribution contributes negligible amounts of rrl emission ; this result is common to all valid solutions in this model .",
    "we find that the allowed combinations of the free parameters and l@xmath32 ( the latter being derived from n@xmath20 and c@xmath16 : see section 3 ) are such that the value of is about 10@xmath1 and the size of the gas at this density ( which is the dominant contributor to the total line strength ) is between 3 - 10 pc .",
    "this result explains why the results of models i , ii and iii agree well with those of model iv .",
    "hence model iv , which is the first attempt at a consistent multi - density model for extragalactic rrl data , validates the assumption of a single - density ionized gas in modeling the line emission .",
    "it should be noted that the narrow range of allowed densities near @xmath010@xmath1 is not the density at which the 92 line emission is expected to peak ( from figure 4(a ) , this density is @xmath010@xmath33 ) . that both the constant density models as well as the multiple density models give the same density of @xmath010@xmath1 , vastly different from the density at which 92 is expected to peak , is reason enough to believe that most of the ionized gas in this region does indeed have a density close to 10@xmath1 and that the amount of gas at a density of 10@xmath33 must be insignificant compared to the higher density gas .",
    "however , the above argument works only if the density distribution is a power law . in general in a multi - density environment , where the total em of gas of a given density is an arbitrary function of density , an approach based on model iv will not work . in such a case ,",
    "multi - frequency rrl data is essential and models have to be constructed to explain the data with a minimum number of different density components ( as was done in the case of arp 220 by anantharamaiah et al .",
    "most of the models discussed in the previous section yield electron densities in excess of a few 1000 within an effective size of 2 - 10 pc ( tables 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the minimum value of the derived is 2.5@xmath2310@xmath34 s@xmath3 .",
    "this value of is computed from the low - resolution data and is consistent with the ionizing photon flux computed from other nebular diagnostics listed below .",
    "the continuum flux density of 28 mjy measured from the line emitting region ( which is the position of the peak continuum emission , corresponding to the 6.5@xmath233.3sized resolution element ) in the 8.3 ghz continuum image ( table 2 ) corresponds to = 3@xmath2310@xmath34 s@xmath3 , based on the assumption of an optically thin gas .",
    "the flux from the central 5region @xcite implies an of 1.5@xmath2310@xmath34 s@xmath3 .",
    "the flux density inside an aperture of 5(measured using the image of cmb97 ) gives an of 1.0@xmath2310@xmath34 s@xmath3 .",
    "taking the average value of = 2.5@xmath2310@xmath34 and using a salpeter imf with m@xmath35=80 and the tables given in @xcite , the number of o stars ( o3-o9 ) is estimated to be @xmath01800 .",
    "it should be noted that we have used the numbers from @xcite for solar metallicity whereas the two galaxies ngc 5253 and he 2 - 10 have sub - solar metallicities ; therefore the calculated values of will be underestimated . however , this error is less than 20% @xcite .",
    "assuming m@xmath36 to be 1.0 , the total number of stars within a region of size @xmath05 pc is @xmath03.5@xmath2310@xmath37 .",
    "this @xmath05 pc sized region of gas could be spread over an entire resolution element ( 150 pc for ngc 5253 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the gas is physically in a compact region of size @xmath05 pc , then the corresponding stellar density indicates that the ionizing sources may well be sscs @xcite .",
    "similar to the results for ngc 5253 , most models for he 2 - 10 yield electron densities in excess of a few 1000 within an effective size of 2 - 10 pc ( table 4 ) .",
    "gas densities of 1000 have been derived in the central 2region using [ sii ] line ratios @xcite .",
    "the minimum derived value of for the 5sized rrl emitting region is 4@xmath2310@xmath34 s@xmath3 .",
    "the central 2region has been resolved into a number of star - forming knots and the value of derived from observations which resolve these knots is comparable to that derived here .",
    "@xcite obtain a value of =  2.5@xmath2310@xmath34 from their uv continuum images , while @xcite derive a value of 4@xmath2310@xmath34 from their measured flux inside a 5aperture .",
    "for an of 4@xmath2310@xmath34 s@xmath3 , the number of o stars required is @xmath02900 and the total stellar mass is @xmath05.5@xmath2310@xmath37 ( using a salpeter imf with m@xmath35=80 and m@xmath36 to be 1.0 , and the results of vacca , garmany , & shull 1996 ) . as in the case of ngc 5253 , the corresponding stellar density for a 3 - 10 pc region corresponds to an ssc , if we assume that the ionized gas is physically confined to this @xmath05 pc region ( see section 5.2 for more details ) .",
    "though the derived ionizing photon flux and the length - scale of the gas for both galaxies imply an ssc , the 8.3 ghz rrl data alone does not clarify whether the ionized gas is in a single clump of diameter @xmath05 pc or it is spread out in some unknown geometry over the entire 5region . in the latter case , the ionizing source need not be an ssc . in the next section , we present arguments that the ionized gas is indeed much less than 5 in size .",
    "we also discuss the implications of combining our rrl data and model results with recently published sub - arcsecond resolution continuum images of the centers of the two galaxies ( obtained by tbh00 for ngc 5253 and by kj99 for he 2 - 10 ) .",
    "we can indirectly infer that the rrl emitting region is smaller than 5from the and images of cmb97 .",
    "the image in the inner 5 is quite clumpy with extensive filaments and knots .",
    "though the rrl emission need not follow the emission , it is unlikely that the high density gas responsible for rrl emission is spread smoothly over the 150 pc region , given the patchy appearance of the emission .",
    "and hence we may conclude that the rrl emitting gas must also be patchy within the 5beam .",
    "tbh00 have imaged ngc 5253 at 23 ghz and 15 ghz with the vla with angular resolutions of 0.13and 0.2 , respectively .",
    "a compact ( @xmath00.1 , or 2 pc ) source with a flux density of 11 mjy at 15 ghz , and hence a brightness temperature of 12000 @xmath38 3000 k , was discovered .",
    "this was interpreted as a hii region , and in addition , these authors detect radio emission at a low level with a size of 1 - 2 .",
    "further confirmation of the thermal nature of this source comes from recently detected ir emission from the central object at 11.7 and 18.7 @xmath39 m @xcite .",
    "though the rrl emission is not expected to exactly follow the morphology of continuum emission ( since a particular rrl comes from a limited range of densities , and the continuum emission is sensitive to all densities if optically thin ) , no line emission is expected from continuum - free regions and hence we can associate the observed 92 emission with the inner 1 - 2region . assuming that the observed radio continuum emission from this galaxy is purely due to free - free emission , tbh00 derive an rms electron density of 4 @xmath23 10@xmath1 and an of 4 @xmath23 10@xmath34 . from the ionization requirement and the size of the object ,",
    "tbh00 suggest that this compact source is a surrounding an ssc .",
    "since this source is the strongest radio continuum source in the inner 5region and since the derived properties of the ` supernebula ' , especially the local electron density , match those derived from the rrl data , we tentatively identify the rrl emitting gas with the continuum source detected by tbh00 .",
    "therefore , we have modeled the to estimate the fraction of the observed rrl emission this compact source is capable of producing .",
    "the models are constructed to produce the observed 11 mjy continuum emission at 15 ghz from gas of size @xmath00.1 .",
    "in addition , the continuum and rrl emission by this gas at 8.3 ghz is also constrained to be less than the observed values ( the latter two constraints are imposed as upper limits since the observed values correspond to the larger 5area ) .",
    "the results of this model are summarized in table 5 .",
    "only 10 - 35% of the observed 8.3 ghz line emission can be explained by the tbh00 ` supernebula ' .",
    "all densities @xmath40 5@xmath2310@xmath1 are consistent with the existing observations .",
    "the remaining line emission presumably originates in the surrounding larger nebulosity with a size of 1 - 2 . a calculation similar to the one above",
    ", where we model the inner 3region with a 15 ghz flux density of 22 mjy ( tbh00 ) , shows that such a model is indeed capable of explaining the entire observed rrl line emission .",
    "the ` supernebula ' , as imaged by tbh00 is separated by about 0.9from the position of the brightest knot in cmb97 .",
    "this knot was identified with the uv cluster 5 in the hst image by @xcite .",
    "since the 1@xmath41 error between the absolute reference frames of the guide star catalogue 1 of the hst , on which the and uv images are based , and the extragalactic radio reference frame , on which the images in tbh00 are based , is 0.5(russell et al 1990 and also calzetti , and rajagopal , private communication ) , the radio of tbh00 can also be identified with the peak ( and hence the uv cluster 5 ) within these errors .",
    "the significance of this identification is two - fold .",
    "( 1 ) an additional highly obscured ssc need not be invoked and ( 2 ) we can relate the known properties of the optical cluster with those of the ` supernebula ' .",
    "the flux for this cluster is 4.8@xmath2310@xmath42 w m@xmath7 ( see cmb97 ) from which we infer the value of to be @xmath01.3@xmath2310@xmath43 s@xmath3 .",
    "the discrepancy between this value and @xmath442.5@xmath2310@xmath34 which is derived from radio continuum data ( table 5 ) can be attributed to extinction . however , as the age of the optical cluster is well constrained , the dynamical age of the ionized around it can also be constrained ( see section 7.1 for further details ) .",
    "the central 5region harbors about nine uv clusters , possibly sscs , arranged in an arc of size @xmath02@xcite .",
    "this region has a large patchy extinction and also clumpy ionized gas .",
    "the , uv and optical continuum images of the center show the presence of several knots @xcite .",
    "kj99 have imaged the radio continuum emission of the nucleus of henize 2 - 10 with an angular resolution of 0.5using the vla .",
    "they detect 4 - 5 compact knots , each of diameter @xmath00.6 , arranged within a 5@xmath232region .",
    "these knots of star formation detected individually in the optical , , and radio continuum are not positionally consistent , possibly due to intrinsic astrometric errors",
    ". attempts at aligning the various images using global astrometric offset corrections have shown that not all knots have counterparts at all wavelengths ( kj99 and johnson et al .",
    "2000 ) ; thus there appears to be hidden regions of star formation in the central 5region .",
    "this morphological evidence for the clumpy gas at the center indicates that the rrl emitting gas is also clumpy on scales @xmath85 .",
    "based on the continuum spectra , kj99 infer that the radio knots consist of thermal gas at densities 1500 - 5000 ( optically thick at 8.3 ghz ) and also derive a total of 4@xmath2310@xmath34 s@xmath3 . they suggest that each compact knot may be ionized by a ssc .",
    "we have modeled this region to look for solutions which produce the observed radio continuum flux densities at 15 , 8 and 5 ghz , as reported by kj99 .",
    "the allowed solutions are also constrained to produce either all or a part of the observed 92 line .",
    "the model results are listed in table 5 and these radio knots , if thermal , are indeed capable of producing all of the observed 92 recombination line .",
    "therefore we identify these multiple radio continuum knots with the gas responsible for emitting the observed rrl at 8.3 ghz and associate the ionizing sources with sscs .",
    "the fir luminosity and the radio luminosity of galaxies which are dominated by star formation as opposed to an agn are very tightly correlated with an rms of @xmath450.2 dex on the logarithmic scale @xcite .",
    "this radio - fir correlation holds for several types of galaxies such as normal spirals , dwarf starbursts and dwarf irregulars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the physical reason for this correlation is not well understood in detail but may result from a chain of events involving star formation .",
    "the thermal ( free - free ) portion of the radio emission is from gas ionized by ob stars and the non - thermal ( synchrotron ) portion of the radio emission arises from the cosmic rays accelerated in snrs , the end point of type ii sne caused by massive stars .",
    "the warm ( t @xmath44 30k , s@xmath46/s@xmath47 @xmath40 1 ) dust portion of the fir emission arises from dust directly heated by ob stars and the cool ( t @xmath8 30 k , s@xmath46/s@xmath47 @xmath8 0.8 ) dust portion of the fir emission arises from dust heated by the diffuse interstellar radiation field . @xcite have shown in the case of the lmc that the warm dust emission correlates with the thermal radio emission , while the cool dust emission correlates independently with the non - thermal radio emission .",
    "also , the ratio of the two correlated quantities for both these independent correlations was shown to be the same as that between the the total fir and the total radio emission strengths .",
    "the radio continuum of most disk galaxies is dominated by non - thermal emission since the thermal fraction is typically 0.05 - 0.2 at 1.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "but it is known that the bcdgs have a higher fraction of thermal emission than disk galaxies : @xcite showed that the average radio spectral index @xmath48 is @xmath50.4 for bcdgs , while it is @xmath50.7 for normal spirals , s@xmath49 . though the mean spectral index is indeed flatter for bcdgs , the dispersion in the index is much larger than for spirals and hence they did not estimate an average thermal fraction for the bcd galaxy sample .",
    "bcdgs also have a higher dust temperature ( wunderlich and klein 1988 , hereafter wk88 ) compared to spiral galaxies which implies that their fir emission is dominated by emission from warm dust .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite and wk88 that the reason the bcdgs also obey the radio - fir correlation is because this dominant warm dust emission correlates with the thermal radio emission , which is the dominant portion of the radio continuum .",
    "ngc 5253 may well be an unique case which will help to understand the details of the radio - fir correlation .",
    "radio continuum flux density measurements at various frequencies using single dishes and low resolution images have shown that the radio emission of ngc 5253 is consistent with being almost purely thermal ( see @xcite and also the spectral index map of turner , ho , & beck 1998 ) .",
    "its total flux density at 1.4 ghz is 89 mjy ( from the nvss catalogue of condon et al .",
    "1998 and single - dish observations ) and the fir flux is calculated to be 8@xmath2310@xmath50 from the iras flux densities . from the ratio of the radio to the fir luminosity , it can be seen that this galaxy obeys the radio - fir correlation @xcite to within 1.5@xmath41 .",
    "this is a surprising result , since the non - thermal emission in this galaxy is less than 10% of the total emission at 5 ghz @xcite .",
    "it is known that the radio flux density and the fir flux density of galactic hii regions are also correlated , but with a different ratio @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio of radio to fir flux densities of compact hii regions is not a constant , but depends on a variety of factors @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that though the radio emission of ngc 5253 is almost purely thermal , the radio to fir emission ratio is similar to star forming galaxies rather than hii regions .",
    "one way to explain the correlation is the following : the dust temperature in the nucleus of ngc 5253 is high ; @xcite estimated it to be 51 k. this high dust temperature is the reason why the ratio of the strength of the warm dust emission to the cool dust emission is about 16 , one of the largest among bcdgs and disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore we suggest that the reason ngc 5253 obeys the radio - fir correlation is that the warm dust emission and the thermal radio emission are indeed correlated with each other , and the slope of the correlation is the same as that between the total fir and total radio in normal spirals , as suggested by @xcite and wk88 .",
    "wk88 had also put forward an alternative explanation for bcdgs obeying the radio - fir correlation .",
    "they had suggested that a possible lower dust fraction in these galaxies would compensate for the lower non - thermal radio fraction .",
    "this explanation is unlikely for ngc 5253 , since among all bcdgs , it has the lowest non - thermal fraction but the highest dust to gas ratio @xcite .",
    "the detection of a rrl from the central region of both galaxies with parameters similar to those derived by tbh00 and kj99 is added confirmation for the thermal nature of the central compact source(s ) . additionally , an rrl study of dense ionized gas has the following advantages : ( 1 ) instead of the rms electron density as given by the continuum data , local electron densities , independent of filling factor , can be derived from rrl data .",
    "( 2 ) therefore , if the line emitting region is spatially resolved , then the actual value of can be derived ( and not just the lower limit ) .",
    "( 3 ) due to non - lte effects , rrls retain their sensitivity to density even in gas which is moderately optically thick , unlike continuum emission .",
    "a question not yet addressed regards the dynamics and time - scales involved in explaining the existence of @xmath010@xmath1 of ionized gas within a few parsecs of an ssc . in this section",
    ", we will identify the ` supernebula(e ) ' with the rrl emitting gas in both the galaxies and also tentatively associate the ` supernebula ' in ngc 5253 with the star cluster in the center .",
    "the observed fwhm of @xmath0100  ( estimated from the spectrum before offline hanning smoothing ) within a 2 - 8 pc sized region implies a dynamical expansion time of 2 - 8@xmath2310@xmath1 years , quite short compared to the estimated age of 1@xmath53 @xmath2310@xmath51 years for the central cluster in ngc 5253 .",
    "therefore , either the supernebula must have been set into motion extremely recently , or there must exist a confining mechanism operating in the central region .",
    "in addition , strong stellar winds from ob and wolf - rayet stars as well as the natural expansion of the hii region due to overpressure would drive the ionized gas outwards . given the large mass , high density and small size of the observed hii region ( @xmath02 pc for the of tbh00 and kj99 and 5 - 8 pc for the rrl emitting gas ) , dynamical models should constrain both the age of the ssc as well as the density of the ambient unshocked medium . for ngc 5253 , for example ,",
    "if the is identified with the uv cluster 5 , then the age is determined to be less than 3 million years ( cmb97 ) .",
    "if we assume the hii region to have reached a diameter of 1 pc solely due to expansion driven by overpressure in @xmath02 myr , then the radius of the initial stromgren sphere would be @xmath00.01 pc @xcite .",
    "if at the time of formation of the initial stromgren sphere , the ionizing photon flux were @xmath010@xmath34 s@xmath3 , then the corresponding initial density should be @xmath02@xmath2310@xmath52 .",
    "in such a case , the mass of the shocked neutral gas between the shock and the ionization fronts would be more than 100 times greater in the ionized gas inside the ionization front @xcite .",
    "in addition , stellar winds will definitely play an important dynamical role . using starburst 99 @xcite , a mechanical luminosity of 10@xmath53 ergs",
    "is estimated for an of 10@xmath34 s@xmath3 , assuming a continuous starburst model .",
    "assuming that the isothermal phase sets in early in the lifetime of the hii region , the radius of the thin swept - up ionized shell is given by r@xmath54 = 16 ( @xmath55)@xmath56 t@xmath57 pc , where l is the mechanical luminosity in units of 10@xmath58 ergs s@xmath3 , v is the velocity of the stellar wind at infinity ( assumed to be 1000 ) , n@xmath59 is the density of the ambient medium and t@xmath60 is the time in millions of years @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the ionized shell is given by n@xmath59r@xmath54/(3n@xmath61 ) @xcite , where n@xmath61 , the density of the shocked ionized gas , is given by n@xmath61=n@xmath59@xmath23v@xmath62/c@xmath33 for an isothermal shock ( v@xmath61 is the velocity of the shock , dr@xmath54/dt , and c is the speed of sound in the ambient medium ) .",
    "the values of n@xmath59 and t can be expressed in terms of n@xmath61 and the mass of the ionized gas .",
    "the range of input parameters are 10@xmath12 @xmath45 n@xmath63 5@xmath2310@xmath1 and 10@xmath12 @xmath45  m @xmath45 10@xmath1 , which are similar to the ranges for the models in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "the ranges of the derived values are 0.01 @xmath45 n@xmath59 @xmath45 100 and 10@xmath37 yr @xmath45 t",
    "@xmath45 2@xmath2310@xmath51 yr . although the derived values do not violate any known constraints , the allowed solution space and a detailed modeling based on future higher resolution continuum images would be useful to understand the dynamics and the ambient environment of these regions .",
    "for an initial attempt at such an analysis , see @xcite .",
    "the commonly occuring relatively high density of @xmath010@xmath1 for the compact ionized gas in the starburst regions in he 2 - 10 and ngc 5253 and also in other starburst galaxies ( gilbert et al 2000 , zhao et al 1997 , anantharamaiah et al 2000 , tbh00 , kj99 ) is striking .",
    "one model which may be able to explain this commonly occuring high densities is that of @xcite . in their model ,",
    "a gmc in the center of a starburst region is shocked by the overpressure of the surrounding molecular inter - cloud medium ( icm ) .",
    "the outer shell of the gmc is shock - compressed and moves inwards , and at a later stage , due to onset of gravitational instabilities , it fragments into star forming centers .",
    "this model can well explain the formation of sscs of mass @xmath4010@xmath37 .",
    "an estimate of the density of the shell fragments when star formation begins in the imploding shell is possible . from @xcite ,",
    "the velocity of the shock , v@xmath61 , at the onset of gravitational instabilities can be as high as @xmath030 and the radius of the shock front reaches @xmath040% of the gmc radius . adopting a value of the sound speed , c@xmath61 , inside the gmc as 4 , the density of the shocked gas , n@xmath61=n@xmath64v@xmath62/c@xmath62 , is increased and the value of the density enhancement n@xmath61/n@xmath59 can be greater than 55 ( this enhancement can be up to three times larger than this value , for the observed range of values of gmc and icm properties ) . in their model , @xcite",
    "assume that the density of the gmc falls radially as r@xmath3 and that the density at the boundary is at least 100 .",
    "therefore this density enhancement could explain the observed densities of 10@xmath12 - 10@xmath1 observed in rrls .",
    "it remains to be seen if there is indeed a high pressure reservoir of molecular gas or shocked hot gas at the centers of these galaxies , and if so , whether star formation occurs via this process .",
    "it should be noted that co images of the centers of these two galaxies do not show evidence for gas in this region and therefore we appeal to whichever gas reservoir gave rise to the sscs in the center to provide the neccesary high pressure .",
    "however the high density ambient medium is not needed as in the previous cases , since remnant clouds of density @xmath010@xmath1 would still remain in the vicinity of the star cluster and be ionized .",
    "the rrl observations in this paper and the recent continuum observations of ` supernebulae ' may well be the first detection of ionized gas around extremely young sscs .",
    "since these clusters are usually too obscured to be studied even in the ir , higher resolution radio continuum and line data can be used to infer the properties of the ambient medium around sscs , and ultimately , the formation mechanism of these massive clusters .",
    "sensitive line data will also yield kinematic information about these nebulae .",
    "but an important problem is the identification of the radio components with the optical and uv components at the sub - arcsecond level , which should be achievable in a few years .",
    "we have detected the 92 recombination line from two dwarf starbursts ngc 5253 and he 2 - 10 .",
    "the ionized gas responsible for both line emission and the radio continuum emission is modeled in terms of electron density and size .",
    "the line emitting gas in both galaxies is found to be of densities @xmath010@xmath1 with a size of 2 - 10 pc , implying an of a few times 10@xmath34 s@xmath3 .",
    "we also consider a multi - density model for the rrl - emitting gas and show that the assumption of a constant density in previous models is valid in a wide range of cases . though the line emission is spatially unresolved and the linear size of the beam area corresponds to 150 pc and 315 pc respectively for ngc 5253 and he 2 - 10 , we present arguments which suggest that the line emission is compact ( few parsecs ) .",
    "based on the derived parameters , these lines seem to originate from ionized gas associated with sscs in both galaxies .",
    "the possible ` supernebulae ' around these clusters have been detected in radio continuum emission and we show that these nebulae are capable of producing all the observed line emission in both the galaxies .",
    "both the detection of rrl emission as well as direct radio continuum imaging of these around sscs pose problems about the lifetimes and dynamics of the ionized gas .",
    "we present simple arguments to show that reconciling the dynamical age of the with the age of the sscs might be difficult and that detailed observational data as well as theoretical modeling are neccesary in order to understand the dynamics of hii regions around these massive clusters .",
    "finally , we point out that though ngc 5253 has a thermal radio spectrum , it seems to obey the radio - fir correlation , which is known to hold for galaxies dominated by non - thermal radio emission",
    ". this feature may well be evidence for the warm dust portion of the fir emission to be correlated with the thermal radio emission , independent of the cold dust fir emission and the non - thermal radio emission , as suggested by @xcite .",
