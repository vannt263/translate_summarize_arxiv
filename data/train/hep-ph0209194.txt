    "cp violation is currently the focus of a great deal of attention . since the start of operation of the b - factories , the standard model description of cp violation via the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite",
    "is being tested with increasing precision .",
    "babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite have recently published measurements of the ckm parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , verifying the ckm mechanism to within the experimental sensitivity .",
    "although improved measurements of @xmath4 and @xmath6 mixing will probe the theory with greater scrutiny during the next few years , the measurement of the other angles of the unitarity triangle are necessary for a comprehensive study of cp violation .",
    "important constraints on the theory will be obtained from measurements of the ckm phase @xmath7 .",
    "a promising method for measuring this phase in the @xmath8 system has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "although this method involves color - allowed decays and hence offers favorable rates , it makes use of @xmath9 mesons , which are not produced at b - factories operating at the @xmath10(4s ) resonance .",
    "by contrast , the extraction of @xmath0 using the b@xmath11 and b@xmath12 system generally involves decays which are highly suppressed or difficult to reconstruct .",
    "in addition , these methods are generally subject to an eight - fold ambiguity due to _ a - priori _ unknown strong phases  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "obtaining satisfactory sensitivity requires very high statistics and necessitates the use of as many decay modes and measurement methods as possible .    one important class of",
    "theoretically clean measurements will make use of decays of the type @xmath13 .",
    "gronau and wyler  @xcite have proposed to measure @xmath14 in the interference between the @xmath15 decay @xmath16 and the color - suppressed @xmath17 decay @xmath18 .",
    "interference between these amplitudes takes place when the @xmath19 meson is observed as one of the cp - eigenstates @xmath20 which are identified by their decay products , such as @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "several variations of this method have been developed@xcite , including addressing the effects of doubly cabibbo - suppressed decays of the @xmath19 meson  @xcite and mixing and cp - violation in the neutral @xmath19 meson system  @xcite , as well as insights to be gained from charm factory measurements  @xcite .",
    "a serious difficulty with measuring @xmath0 using @xmath13 is that the @xmath17 amplitude is expected to be extremely small . to a large degree , this is due to the color - suppression associated with the internal spectator diagram through which this amplitude proceeds . in the factorization model , color - suppression of the amplitude",
    "is parameterized by the phenomenological ratio @xmath23 .",
    "this ratio is measured to be about @xmath24  @xcite by comparing decay modes which depend only on color - allowed amplitudes with those that depend on both color - allowed and color - suppressed amplitudes . with this value of @xmath23 ,",
    "one expects the amplitude ratio @xmath25 to be only about 0.1 .",
    "the small branching fraction @xmath26 is therefore very difficult to measure with adequate precision , resulting in a large statistical error in the measurement of @xmath14 .",
    "the recent observation of the color - suppressed decays @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 by belle  @xcite and cleo  @xcite has raised the possibility that @xmath30 may be effectively larger in some modes .",
    "however , significant suppression is still expected for internal spectator diagrams .    this difficulty has led to attempts to address the problems presented by color suppression .",
    "dunietz  @xcite proposed to apply the method to the decays @xmath31 , making use of the fact that the decay @xmath32 tags the flavor of the @xmath33 . in this mode , both the @xmath15 and the @xmath17 amplitudes are color suppressed , and hence of similar magnitudes , albeit small .",
    "jang and ko  @xcite and gronau and rosner  @xcite have devised a method in which the small branching fraction of the color - suppressed decay @xmath18 does not have to be measured directly .",
    "rather , it is essentially inferred by using the larger branching fractions of the decays @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "quantitative study suggests that the various alternative methods are roughly as sensitive as the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , and are thus useful for increasing statistics and providing consistency checks  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigate a way to circumvent the color suppression penalty by using @xmath1 decay modes which could potentially offer significantly large branching fractions , as well as large cp asymmetries .",
    "similar modes involving neutral @xmath8 decays can also be used .",
    "for example the final state @xmath37 can be analyzed with the same technique as described here .",
    "some other decays ( such as @xmath38 ) need a different treatment and will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the particular decays which are considered here are of the type .",
    "these three body final states may be obtained by popping a @xmath39 pair in color allowed decays .",
    "although modes where one or more of the three final state particles is a vector can also be used , for clarity and simplicity only the mode  is discussed here .    figs .",
    "[ fig : bdkpi1 ] and  [ fig : bdkpi2 ] show the diagrams leading to the final states of interest . as can be seen , the leading diagrams ( fig .",

    ", avoiding the complications which arise due to the small magnitude of the @xmath17 amplitude in the two - body decays . as a result",
    ", observable cp - violating effects in the three - body decays are expected to be large , and the @xmath17 amplitude is more easily measured from the relatively large branching fraction @xmath42 , which is now subject to significantly less contamination from doubly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath19 meson decays than the corresponding two - body modes .",
    "however , should the @xmath17 amplitude be unexpectedly small , one could still carry out the analysis described in this paper by taking doubly cabibbo - suppressed decays into account  @xcite .",
    "let us examine how one could observe cp violation and measure the angle @xmath0 in these decays .",
    "we first consider the case of very large statistics , and then discuss how one would proceed when the data sample is limited .",

    "[ fig : bdkpi1 ] ( fig .  [ fig : bdkpi2 ] ) .",
    "let us note here that we have used the wolfenstein parameterization at order @xmath51(@xmath52 ) .",
    "should one use the full expansion , a small weak phase of order @xmath53 would be present .",
    "indeed the angle which is measured is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "the angle @xmath56 is one of the angles  @xcite arising from the unitarity relation @xmath57 . the amplitudes in eqs .",
    "[ eq : bpamp ] can be obtained from the measurements of the b decay widths @xmath58 eq .",

    "[ eq : width ] and  [ eq : widthcp ] , one extracts @xmath14 from @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "hence in the limit of very high statistics , one would extract @xmath14 for each point @xmath44 of the dalitz plot and therefore obtain many measurements of the same quantity .",
    "this would allow one to obtain a large set of redundant measurements from which a precise and consistent value of @xmath14 could be extracted .",
    "we note that in our treatment we disregard doubly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath64 decays  @xcite since , due to the lack of color - suppression , their effect is small , and can be dealt with  @xcite in any case .    in every point of the dalitz plot ,",
    "@xmath0 is obtained with an eight - fold ambiguity , which is a consequence of the invariance of the @xmath65 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : widthcp ] ) under the three symmetry operations  @xcite @xmath66 however , an important benefit is gained from the multiple measurements made in different points of the dalitz plot . when results from the different points are combined , some of the ambiguity will be resolved , in the likely case that the strong phase @xmath67 varies from one region of the dalitz to the other .",
    "this variation can either be due to the presence of resonances or because of a varying phase in the non - resonant contribution . in this case",
    ", the exchange symmetry @xmath68 is numerically different from one point to the other , which in effect breaks this symmetry and resolves the ambiguity .",
    "similarly , the @xmath69 symmetry is broken if there exists some _ a - priori _ knowledge of the dependence of @xmath67 on the dalitz plot parameters .",
    "this knowledge is provided by the existence of broad resonances , whose breit - wigner phase variation is known and may be assumed to dominate the phase variation over the width of the resonance . to illustrate this ,",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath70 be two points in the dalitz plot , corresponding to different values of the invariant mass of the decay products of a particular resonance .",
    "for simplicity we consider only one resonance .",
    "one then measures @xmath65 at point @xmath44 and @xmath71 at point @xmath70 , where @xmath72 is known from the parameters of the resonance .",
    "it is important to note that the sign of @xmath72 is also known , hence it does not change under @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , should one choose the @xmath69-related solution @xmath73 at point @xmath44 , one would get @xmath74 at point @xmath70 . since this is different from @xmath71 , the @xmath69 ambiguity is resolved .",
    "this is illustrated graphically in eq .",
    "[ eq : ssign ] : @xmath75    thus , broad resonances reduce the initial eight - fold ambiguity to the two - fold ambiguity of the @xmath76 symmetry , which is not broken . fortunately , @xmath76 leads to the well - separated solutions @xmath0 and @xmath77 , the correct one of which is easily identified when this measurement is combined with other measurements of the unitarity triangle .",
    "since experimental data sets will be finite , extracting @xmath0 will require making use of a limited set of parameters to describe the variation of amplitudes and strong phases over the dalitz plot",
    ". the consistency of this approach can be verified by comparing the results obtained from fits of the data in a few different regions of the dalitz plot , and the systematic error due to the choice of the parameterization of the data may be obtained by using different parameterizations .",
    "a fairly general parameterization assumes the existence of @xmath78 breit - wigner resonances , as well as a non - resonant contribution : @xmath79 where @xmath56 represents the dalitz plot variables , @xmath80 is the breit - wigner amplitude for a particle of spin @xmath81 , normalized such that @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) are the magnitude and cp - conserving phase of the non - resonant @xmath17 ( @xmath15 ) amplitude , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) are the magnitudes and cp - conserving phase of the @xmath17 ( @xmath15 ) amplitude associated with resonance @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 may be assumed to vary slowly over the dalitz plot , allowing their description in terms of a small number of parameters .",

    "( [ eq : amp - param ] ) are determined by minimizing the negative log likelihood function @xmath100 where @xmath101 are the dalitz plot variables of event @xmath44 .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider the resonances which may contribute to the @xmath102 final state .",
    "obvious candidates are broad @xmath103 and @xmath104 states .",
    "however , only the ones which can decay as @xmath105 or @xmath106 are relevant for the final state of interest .",
    "this exclude the @xmath107 states , which would decay to @xmath108 or @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath110 is essentially produced through a @xmath111 , the @xmath112 state is forbidden as well .",
    "thus , one does not expect a large contribution from these states",
    ". a promising candidate might be the broad @xmath113 recently observed by the belle collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we note that including such resonances in the analysis does not raise particular difficulties and would further enhance the sensitivity of the @xmath0 measurement .",
    "similar arguments can be made for higher excited @xmath114 states .",
    "one also expects narrow resonances , such as the @xmath115 and a narrow @xmath110 state , to be produced .",
    "however , as seen in the dalitz plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : dalitz ] , these resonances do not overlap , and hence do not interfere .",
    "in addition , interference between a very narrow resonance and either a broad resonance or a non - resonant term is suppressed in proportion to the square root of the narrow resonance width .",
    "therefore , narrow resonances contribute significantly to the cp violation measurement only if both the @xmath15 and @xmath17 amplitudes proceed through the same resonance .",
    "this scenario is favorable , but is not necessary for the success of our method , and will therefore not be focused on in the rest of this study . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss important properties of the method by considering the illustrative case , in which the @xmath17 decay proceeds only via a non - resonant amplitude , and the @xmath15 decay has a non - resonant contribution and a single resonant amplitude . for concreteness",

    "we take the @xmath56-dependent non - resonant phases to be @xmath117 . under these circumstances , the pdf of eq .",

    "( [ eq : bw ] ) .",
    "the cosines @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) arise from interference between the non - resonant ( resonant ) @xmath15 amplitude and the non - resonant @xmath17 amplitude .",
    "the phases @xmath84 , @xmath123 , and @xmath0 are all _ a - priori _ unknown .",
    "however , it is important to note that @xmath123 is fully determined from the interference between the resonant and non - resonant contributions to the relatively high statistics decay mode @xmath124 as a function of the dalitz plot variables .",
    "therefore , @xmath123 is obtained with no ambiguities , and with an error much smaller than those of @xmath84 or @xmath0 amplitudes is small enough that the determination of @xmath123 becomes difficult , one effectively has @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and the determination of @xmath123 is again not a problem . ] .",
    "consequently , the only relevant symmetry operations are @xmath127 as discussed above , only @xmath76 is a symmetry of all four cosines of eq .",

    "one can see that approximate invariance of one of the cosines @xmath122 implies minimal change in the @xmath142 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2 ] ) , which may result in a resolved yet clearly observable ambiguity . since both @xmath122 terms",
    "are only approximately invariant under the product @xmath135 , this ambiguity is more strongly resolved than either @xmath133 or @xmath134 .",
    "observing that no single operation in the table  [ tab : cosines ] is a good symmetry of all cosines , one identifies two different regimes : in the non - resonant regime , interference with the non - resonant @xmath15 is dominant , and only @xmath68 and @xmath69 may lead to ambiguities . in the resonant regime ,",

    "<S> we present a method to measure the weak phase @xmath0 in the three - body decay of charged @xmath1 mesons to the final states @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these decays are mediated by interfering amplitudes which are color - allowed and hence relatively large . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> large cp violation effects that could be observed with high statistical significance are possible . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the three - body decay helps resolve discrete ambiguities that are usually present in measurements of the weak phase . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental implications of conducting these measurements with three - body decays are discussed , and the sensitivity of the method is evaluated using a simulation .    </S>",
