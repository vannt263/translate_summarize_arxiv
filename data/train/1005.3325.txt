    "the birnbaum  saunders ( @xmath1 ) distribution has received considerable attention in the last few years . it was proposed by @xcite and is also known as the fatigue life distribution .",
    "it describes the total time until the damage caused by the development and growth of a dominant crack reaches a threshold level and causes a failure .",
    "the random variable @xmath2 is said to have a @xmath1 distribution with parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath5 , if its probability density function is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( shape parameter ) and @xmath10 ( scale parameter ) .",
    "it is positively skewed , the skewness decreasing with @xmath3 . for any constant @xmath11",
    ", it follows that @xmath12 .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the reciprocal property holds : @xmath13 , which is in the same family of distributions @xcite .",
    "there are several recent articles considering the @xmath1 distribution ; see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , among others .",
    "@xcite introduced a log - linear regression model based on the @xmath1 distribution by showing that if @xmath5 , then @xmath14 has a sinh - normal distribution with shape , location and scale parameters given by @xmath3 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , say @xmath17 .",
    "the regression model proposed by the authors is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the logarithm of the @xmath20th observed lifetime , @xmath21 contains the @xmath20th observation on @xmath22 covariates ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 is a vector of unknown regression parameters , and @xmath25 .",
    "diagnostic tools for the @xmath1 regression model can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in the @xmath1 regression model hypothesis testing inference",
    "is usually performed using the likelihood ratio , rao score and wald tests .",
    "a new criterion for testing hypothesis , referred to as the _ gradient test _ , has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "its statistic shares the same first order asymptotic properties with the likelihood ratio , wald and score statistics and is very simple when compared with the other three classic tests .",
    "in fact , @xcite wrote : `` the suggestion by terrell is attractive as it is simple to compute .",
    "it would be of interest to investigate the performance of the [ gradient ] statistic . '' to the best of our knowledge",
    ", however , there is no mention in the statistical literature on the use of the gradient test in @xmath1 regressions .    in this paper",
    "we compare the four rival tests from two different points of view .",
    "first , we invoke asymptotic arguments .",
    "we then move to a finite - sample comparison , which is accomplished by means of a simulation study .",
    "our principal aim is to help practitioners to choose among the different criteria when performing inference in @xmath1 regressions .    on asymptotic grounds",
    ", it is known that , to the first order of approximation , the likelihood ratio , wald , score and gradient statistics have the same asymptotic distributional properties either under the null hypothesis or under a sequence of local alternatives , i.e.  a sequence of pitman alternatives converging to the null hypothesis at a convergence rate @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "up to an error of order @xmath26 the corresponding criteria have the same size properties but their local powers differ in the @xmath0 term",
    ". a meaningful comparison among the criteria can be performed by comparing the nonnull asymptotic expansions to order @xmath0 of the distribution functions of these statistics under a sequence of pitman alternatives . in this regard",
    ", we can benefit from the work by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived the nonnull asymptotic expansions up to order @xmath0 for the densities of the likelihood ratio and wald statistics , while an analogous result for the score statistic was obtained by @xcite .",
    "recently , the asymptotic expansion up to order @xmath0 for the density of the gradient statistic was derived by @xcite .",
    "the expansions obtained by these authors are extremely general but it can be very difficult or even impossible to particularize their formulas for specific regression models .",
    "as we shall see below , we have been able to apply their results for the @xmath1 regression model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    ", we have @xmath192 @xmath193 hence , we arrive at the following inequalities : @xmath194 if @xmath195 , and @xmath196 if @xmath197 .",
    "the most important finding obtained so far is that the likelihood ratio , score , wald and gradient tests for testing the null hypothesis @xmath133 share the same null size and local power up to an error of order @xmath26 . to this order of approximation",
    "the null distribution of the four statistics is @xmath198 .",
    "therefore , if the sample size is large , type i error probabilities of all the tests do not significantly deviate from the true nominal level , and their powers are approximately equal for alternatives that are close to the null hypothesis .    the natural question now is how these tests perform when the sample size is small or of moderate size , and which one is the most reliable . in the next section , we shall use monte carlo simulations to put some light on this issue .",
    "in this section we shall present the results of a monte carlo simulation in which we evaluate the finite sample performance of the likelihood ratio , wald , score and gradient tests .",
    "the simulations were based on the model @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath25 , @xmath201 .",
    "the covariate values were selected as random draws from the uniform @xmath202 distribution and for fixed @xmath203 those values were kept constant throughout the experiment .",
    "the number of monte carlo replications was 15,000 , the nominal levels of the tests were @xmath58 = 10% , 5% and 1% , and all simulations were performed using the ox matrix programming language @xcite .",
    "ox is freely distributed for academic purposes and available at http://www.doornik.com .",
    "all log - likelihood maximizations with respect to @xmath83 and @xmath3 were carried out using the bfgs quasi - newton method with analytic first derivatives through maxbfgs subroutine .",
    "this method is generally regarded as the best - performing nonlinear optimization method @xcite .",
    "the initial values in the iterative bfgs scheme were @xmath204 for @xmath83 and @xmath205 for @xmath3 , where @xmath206    first , the null hypothesis is @xmath207 , which is tested against a two - sided alternative .",
    "the sample size is @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "the values of the response were generated using @xmath211 .",
    "the null rejection rates of the four tests are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "it is evident that the likelihood ratio ( @xmath46 ) and wald ( @xmath47 ) tests are markedly liberal , more so as the number of regressors increases .",
    "the score ( @xmath48 ) and gradient ( @xmath49 ) tests are also liberal in most of the cases , but much less size distorted than the likelihood ratio and wald tests in all cases . for instance , when @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 , the rejection rates are 10.12% ( @xmath46 ) , 12.77% ( @xmath47 ) , 7.12% ( @xmath48 ) and 7.32% ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "it is noticeable that the score test is much less liberal than the likelihood ratio and wald tests and slightly less liberal than the gradient test .",
    "the score and gradient tests are slightly conservative in some cases .",
    "additionally , the wald test is much more liberal than the other tests .",
    "similar results hold for @xmath215 .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] reports results for @xmath216 and @xmath217 and sample sizes ranging from 15 to 200 .",
    "as expected , the null rejection rates of all the tests approach the corresponding nominal levels as the sample size grows .",
    "again , the score and gradient tests present the best performances .    .null rejection rates ( % ) ; @xmath3 = 0.5 and 1.0 , with @xmath218 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we now turn to the finite - sample power properties of the four tests . the simulation results above show that the tests have different sizes when one uses their asymptotic @xmath219 distribution in small and moderate - sized samples . in evaluating the power of these tests ,",
    "it is important to ensure that they all have the correct size under the null hypothesis . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we used 500,000 monte carlo simulated samples , drawn under the null hypothesis , to estimate the exact critical value of each test for the chosen nominal level .",
    "we set @xmath218 , @xmath220 , @xmath216 and @xmath221 .",
    "for the power simulations we computed the rejection rates under the alternative hypothesis @xmath222 , for @xmath223 ranging from @xmath224 to @xmath225 .",
    "figure  [ figpower ] shows that the power curves of the four tests are indistinguishable from each other .",
    "as expected , the powers of the tests approach 1 as @xmath226 grows .",
    "power simulations carried out for other values of @xmath203 , @xmath22 and @xmath58 showed a similar pattern .    ,",
    "@xmath220 , @xmath216 and @xmath221.,width=377,height=283 ]    overall , in small to moderate - sized samples the best performing tests are the score and the gradient tests .",
    "they are less size distorted than the other two and are as powerful as the others .",
    "we also performed monte carlo simulations considering hypothesis testing on @xmath3 . to save space ,",
    "the results are not shown .",
    "the score and gradient tests exhibited superior behavior than the likelihood ratio and wald tests .",
    "for example , when @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath214 and @xmath229 , we obtained the following null rejection rates : 9.99% ( @xmath46 ) , 15.89% ( @xmath47 ) , 5.29% ( @xmath48 ) and 6.99% ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "again , the best performing tests are the score and gradient tests .",
    "this application focuses on modeling the die lifetime ( @xmath2 ) in the process of metal extrusion .",
    "the data were taken from @xcite . according to the authors , `` the estimation of tool life ( fatigue life ) in the extrusion operation is important for scheduling tool changing times , for adaptive process control and for tool cost evaluation . ''",
    "the authors noted that `` die fatigue cracks are caused by the repeat application of loads which individually would be too small to cause failure . ''",
    "the @xmath1 regression model is then appealing in this context since the main motivation for the @xmath1 distribution is the fatigue failure time due to propagation of an initial crack .",
    "we consider the following regression model : @xmath230 where @xmath231 , @xmath25 , @xmath232 and the covariates are @xmath233 ( friction coefficient ) , @xmath234 ( angle of the die ) and @xmath235 ( work temperature ) , for @xmath236 .",
    "we wish to test the significance of the interaction effects , i.e. , the interest lies in testing @xmath237 . the likelihood ratio , wald , score and gradient test statistics equal @xmath238 ( @xmath22-value : 0.094 ) , @xmath239 ( @xmath22-value : 0.045 ) , @xmath240 ( @xmath22-value : 0.162 ) and @xmath241 ( @xmath22-value : 0.157 ) , respectively .",
    "hence , the null hypothesis is rejected at the 10% nominal level when inference is based on the likelihood ratio or the wald test , but the opposite decision is reached when either the score or the gradient test is used . recall that our simulation results indicated that the likelihood ratio and wald tests are markedly liberal in small samples ( here , @xmath242 ) , which leads us to mistrust the inference delivered by the likelihood ratio and wald tests .",
    "therefore , we removed the interaction effects from the model as indicated by the score and gradient tests .",
    "the model containing only main effects is @xmath243 for @xmath244 .",
    "the null hypothesis @xmath245 is strongly rejected by the four tests at the usual significance levels .",
    "all tests also suggest the individual and joint exclusions of the friction coefficient and angle of the die from the model .",
    "hence , we end up with the regression model @xmath246 , for @xmath236 .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are ( standard errors in parentheses ) : @xmath247 , @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "the @xmath1 regression model is becoming increasingly popular in lifetime analyses and reliability studies . in this paper , we dealt with the issue of performing hypothesis testing concerning the parameters of this model .",
    "we considered the three classic tests , likelihood ratio , wald and score tests , and a recently proposed test , the gradient test .",
    "for the discussion that follows , let us concentrate on tests regarding the regression parameters , which are , in general , of primary interest .",
    "the four tests have the same distribution , under either the null hypothesis or a sequence of local alternatives , up to an error of order @xmath26 , as we showed .",
    "our monte carlo simulation study added some important information .",
    "it revealed that the likelihood ratio and the wald tests can be remarkably oversized if the sample is small .",
    "the score and the gradient tests are clearly much less size distorted than the other two tests .",
    "our power simulations suggested that all the four tests have similar power properties when estimated correct critical values are used .",
    "overall , this is an indication that the score and the gradient tests should be prefered . at this point ,",
    "a discussion on small - sample corrections for the classic tests is in order .",
    "a bartlett correction for the likelihood ratio statistic and a bartlett - type correction for the score statistic were derived in @xcite and @xcite , respectively ; see also cordeiro and ferrari  ( 1991 ) .",
    "the corrected statistics have the following interesting properties : ( i ) the uncorrected and corrected statistics have the same asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis ; ( ii ) the order of the error of the approximation for the distribution of the test statistics by @xmath219 is smaller for the corrected statistics than for the uncorrected statistics ; ( iii ) the corrections have no effect on the @xmath0 term of the local power of the corresponding tests ; ( iv ) simulation results in @xcite and @xcite show that these corrections reduce the size distortion of the tests and that the best performing test in small and moderate - sized samples is the test which uses the corrected score statistic .",
    "therefore , the bartlett - type - corrected score test is an excellent alternative to the tests under consideration in the present paper .",
    "the slight disadvantage of such an alternative is the extra computational burden involved in computing the bartlett - type correction .",
    "we computed the corrected versions of likelihood ratio and score statistics for the hypotheses tested in the real data application presented in section [ application ] .",
    "recall that the hypothesis of no interaction effects is rejected by the likelihood ratio and wald tests , but not rejected by the score and gradient tests .",
    "it is noteworthy that the decision reached by either the corrected likelihood ratio test or the corrected score test is in agreement with that obtained by the later two tests and in disagreement with the likelihood ratio and wald tests , which tend to reject the null hypothesis much more often than indicated by the significance level .    finally , our overall recommendations for practitioners when performing testing inference in @xmath1 regressions are as follows .",
    "the score test or the gradient test should be prefered as both perform better than the likelihood ratio and wald tests in small and moderate - sized samples .",
    "while the gradient test is a little more liberal than the score test , it is easier to calculate .",
    "the bartlett - type corrected score test is a further better option although it requires a small extra computational effort .",
