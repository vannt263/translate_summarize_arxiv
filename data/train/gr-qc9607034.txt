    "a longstanding goal of relativists has been the long - time numerical evolution of a black hole spacetime .",
    "such an evolution is difficult because of the physical singularity the spacetime contains . despite their early promise ,",
    "it has not sufficed to use slicings ( choices of time coordinate ) which avoid the physical singularity .",
    "invariably , such coordinate systems develop coordinate singularities in the vicinity of the event horizon and computationally , physical and coordinate singularities are essentially equally pathological .",
    "many years ago , unruh suggested that it might help to consider evolution of only the exterior of a black hole .",
    "in fact , he argued , since the black hole interior is , by definition , causally disconnected from the rest of the universe , evolution of events within the horizon constituted wasted computational effort . in the necessary absence of exact information concerning the spatial location of the event horizon at any instant during the evolution of given black hole initial data",
    ", unruh proposed that the apparent horizon be tracked and used as an approximation to the true horizon .",
    "thornburg developed these ideas , first in the context of generating initial data for @xmath0 black holes ( each of which could have arbitrary momentum and spin )  @xcite , and then in a program of research for solving the vacuum axisymmetric einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "however , the first clearly successful application of the black - hole excising technique in a dynamical situation came with the work of seidel and suen who studied spherical evolution of the vacuum ( schwarzschild ) as well as a self - gravitating massless scalar field  @xcite . extensions of this work are discussed in anninos et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "@xmath1    the seidel and suen paper is also notable for the introduction of a general technique , termed",
    "_ causal differencing _ , which ensures that , independently of the details of the coordinate system adopted , the difference scheme s numerical domain of dependence contains the physical domain of dependence ( i.e. is causal ) .",
    "alcubierre and schutz have used a similar but somewhat more general technique which they call _ causal reconnection _ to treat the wave equation on an arbitrarily moving grid @xcite .",
    "have recently used black hole excising in a study of gravitational collapse in brans - dicke gravity @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we again use the black hole excising technique to examine the interactions of a black hole with a massless , minimally coupled scalar field in spherical symmetry .",
    "unlike previous work , we use a _ null _ based slicing to get a coordinate system ( ingoing eddington - finkelstein ) which fits naturally with black hole excision ( for a schwarzschild black hole , all variables are static and non - singular ( appropriately smooth ) everywhere on the solution domain , and perturbations about schwarzschild give perturbations of this behavior ) .",
    "further , we introduce a modification to these coordinates which allows for easy tracking of the apparent horizon .",
    "we are able to get a second - order , convergent evolution scheme which will stably evolve forever , and which shows the expected effects of quasi - normal ringing and the power law decay of the scalar field .",
    "we also see some interesting coordinate and nonlinear effects .",
    "the plan of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mmief ] , and following some unpublished previous work  @xcite , we define the minimally - modified ingoing eddington - finkelstein ( mmief ) coordinate system and derive equations of motion for the gravitational and scalar fields which are specialized to this coordinate system .",
    "this derivation is based on detailed calculations of the einstein - klein - gordon equations of motion in a general spherically symmetric coordinate system  @xcite which have been summarized in appendix a. in sec .",
    "[ sec : regularity ] , we examine the issue of regularity at the origin , @xmath2 , with the principal result that use of the coordinate system must be restricted to cases where matter never reaches @xmath2 .",
    "we follow with a detailed description of our finite difference approximations in sec .  [",
    "sec : fde ] and a discussion of initial data in sec .",
    "[ sec : id ] .",
    "we discuss the convergence and stability of our difference solutions in sec .",
    "[ sec : convstab]the evidence presented there suggests that the scheme can be used to carry out arbitrarily long evolutions .",
    "various physical and coordinate effects which have emerged from our studies are discussed in sections sec .",
    "[ sec : mscale]sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlin ] and we end with some concluding remarks .",
    "we note that the programs used to generate the results described below were written in rnpl ( rapid numerical prototyping language ) , a language designed by the authors @xcite .",
    "this language allows for the easy and compact expression of time - dependent systems of partial differential equations and the rapid trial of various finite - difference techniques for solving them .",
    "we begin by recalling that the ingoing eddington - finkelstein ( ief ) coordinate system ( see , for example , chapter 30 of @xcite ) is defined for static , spherically - symmetric spacetimes ( i.e. schwarzschild ) and combines an areal ( measures proper surface area ) radial coordinate @xmath3 , with a time coordinate @xmath4 , which is chosen so that the ingoing tangent combination @xmath5 is null .",
    "[ fig : kruskal ] shows some slices of constant ief time plotted in kruskal - szekeres coordinates .",
    "notice that all of the slices penetrate the horizon and meet the singularity .    in generalizing ief , we first consider the following general `` 3 + 1 '' form for a time - dependent spherically - symmetric metric : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath9 is the metric on the unit - sphere .",
    "we fix the spatial degree of coordinate freedom by introducing a `` shifted '' areal coordinate @xmath10 , defined by @xmath11 for some as yet undetermined function @xmath12 . with this choice ,",
    "the metric becomes @xmath13 comparison with the general form ( [ eq : spmet ] ) yields the identifications @xmath14 and @xmath15 . from the general evolution equation for @xmath16  ( [ eq : spevb ] ) ,",
    "we have @xmath17 here and subsequently , overdots and primes denote partial differentiation with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath3 respectively . solving this last equation for the shift vector component ( or simply `` the shift '' ) @xmath8 , and noting that @xmath18 , @xmath19 , we obtain the condition on the shift which must be dynamically enforced to keep the metric function @xmath10 areal : @xmath20 we now fix the time slicing by demanding that the ingoing combination of timelike and radial tangent vectors@xmath21be null , exactly as in the case of the original ief coordinates .",
    "this gives a condition on the metric , namely @xmath22 . using ( [ eq : shiftmet ] )",
    "this implies @xmath23 we choose the sign so @xmath24 is positive for @xmath25 , that is @xmath26 .",
    "using this and ( [ eq : beta1 ] ) we get @xmath27 hence the metric takes the form @xmath28 factoring the first three terms yields @xmath29 which shows that the characteristic speeds are @xmath30    we now specialize the general spherically - symmetric equations of motion  ( [ eq : speva])-([eq : spmom ] ) given in appendix a to the mmief coordinate system .",
    "the full set of constraint and evolution equations for the geometric variables is : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{\\beta ' a'}{a^2 } + \\frac{\\beta''}{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the wave equation for the massless scalar field becomes the first - order ( in time ) system : @xmath36 @xmath37 ' - \\frac{2\\dot{s}}{s}\\pi.\\ ] ] we note that we have used the slicing condition , @xmath38 , to eliminate the lapse function from the above set .",
    "in addition , as is always the case in general relativistic dynamics , we have more constraint and evolution equations governing the geometric variables than variables themselves .",
    "we adopt the often - used ( and somewhat _ ad hoc _ ) approach of discretizing some sufficient subset of the equations with the expectation that , provided the difference scheme converges , residuals of discretized forms of the remaining equations will be of the same order in the mesh spacing as the truncation error of the difference scheme itself .",
    "in fact , we have made considerable use of our freedom to construct schemes based on various combinations of constraint and evolution equations in the development of the stable second - order methods described in sec  [ sec : fde ] .",
    "it is entirely possible that we could construct a stable scheme without explicit use of the constraints but our attempts to do so with the type of differencing described in sec  [ sec : fde ] were not successful .    since the function @xmath39 ( recall @xmath40 ) is still unspecified , we require one more equation to determine the time - evolution of our model system .",
    "we derive an evolution equation for @xmath12 by demanding that a certain radial coordinate , @xmath41 , be tied to the location of a marginally trapped surface . in general",
    "we will want to track the _ outermost _ marginally trapped surface , so in the following we will assume that the surface we are tracking is , in fact , an apparent horizon .",
    "we recall that if @xmath42 is an outward - pointing , space - like unit normal to a marginally trapped surface , then it satisfies @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the covariant derivative compatible with the 3-metric and @xmath45 .",
    "in spherical symmetry , and with the functional forms of the 3-metric and extrinsic curvature given in appendix a , this equation reduces to @xmath46 in the mmief system this is simply @xmath47 to keep the apparent horizon at fixed @xmath3 , we demand that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the initial position of the apparent horizon .",
    "solving this equation for @xmath50 and using the constraint and evolution equations to eliminate time and space derivatives of the geometric variables , we find : @xmath51    we are most interested in the situation where the initial data for our spacetime describes a black hole of mass @xmath52 which is well separated from any scalar field . in this case",
    "we have @xmath53 and , provided that  ( [ eq : fdot ] ) is satisfied , the apparent horizon will remain at @xmath54 .",
    "the area of the apparent horizon , however , is given by @xmath55 , and hence will increase as matter falls into the black hole , in accord with physical expectations .",
    "it is useful to write down the schwarzschild solution in ief coordinates .",
    "the metric is usually written as @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a null coordinate . defining a time - like coordinate @xmath58 ,",
    "the metric becomes : @xmath59 comparison of this last result with the general form  ( [ eq : spmet ] ) yields the following expressions for the various metric components : @xmath60 where we use overbars on quantities to stress that the expressions are valid only for the vacuum case . using the above and equations ( [ eq : speva ] ) and ( [ eq : spevb ] ) , we can compute the extrinsic curvature components : @xmath61    since we are working in spherical symmetry , we can meaningfully define the mass ( or mass aspect ) function @xmath62 which , at least in a vacuum region , provides an invariant measure of the gravitational mass contained within radius @xmath3 at time @xmath4",
    ". moreover , even when matter is present , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are useful diagnostic quantities in our calculations .",
    "the mass in mmief coordinates can be computed from the surface area using the general expression : @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "substituting this expression for the area into ( [ eq : mass1 ] ) and differentiating , we get @xmath66 by making use of the evolution and constraint equations , we can write this mass as an integral over the mass - density . in this form",
    "we have @xmath67 where as before , @xmath49 is the location of the apparent horizon and @xmath68 .",
    "we note here that as used above , @xmath52 represents the mass of the black hole , that is @xmath69 .",
    "we also define @xmath70 as the total mass in the spacetime , namely @xmath71 given that our finite difference grid does not extend to infinity , we will approximate @xmath70 by taking the upper limit of the above integral to be the outer boundary of our computational domain .",
    "in cases where a black hole is not initially present or there is insufficient mass in the scalar field to form a black hole via collapse , the infalling matter will encounter the coordinate origin , @xmath2 .",
    "as is generically the case when using spherical coordinates , the various geometric and matter variables must satisfy regularity conditions as @xmath72 in order that the origin remain a regular point in the spacetime ( see @xcite for an extensive discussion of regularity conditions ) .    since @xmath73 is a scalar and @xmath74,@xmath75 , and @xmath76 are components of rank - two tensors , we assume that they are even in @xmath3 near the origin .",
    "this means that their spatial derivatives must vanish at @xmath2 : @xmath77    elementary flatness near the origin in mmief coordinates dictates that @xmath78 .",
    "an examination of the momentum constraint ( [ eq : mom ] ) shows that @xmath79(0,t ) .",
    "we can find further conditions by examining the potentially divergent terms of the evolution equation for @xmath80 ( [ eq : kttev ] ) .",
    "these terms , which are those with powers of @xmath3 in the denominator , can be collected and written as @xmath81 clearly , as @xmath82 both the numerator and the denominator of ( [ eq : divterms ] ) go to zero , so we use lhpital s rule to compute the limit .",
    "the derivative of the numerator is @xmath83 .",
    "as @xmath82 this goes to @xmath84 .",
    "the derivative of the denominator is @xmath85 .",
    "clearly this goes to zero as @xmath3 goes to zero .",
    "thus , we must have @xmath86 .",
    "since we still have an indeterminate form , we apply lhpital s rule again .",
    "the second derivative of the numerator is @xmath87 .",
    "as @xmath3 goes to zero , this goes to @xmath88 .",
    "the second derivative of the denominator is @xmath89 .",
    "the limit of this is @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath91    let us now consider the behavior of the spatial derivatives of @xmath8 as @xmath72 .",
    "when there is no black hole present , the shift is given by @xmath92 from this we can easily see that @xmath8 is zero at the origin .",
    "now @xmath93 thus , @xmath94 since we have argued that @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 now the second derivative of @xmath8 is @xmath98 as @xmath72 , this expression vanishes .",
    "thus , @xmath99 .    since @xmath100",
    ", we must have @xmath101 and consequently the right hand side of ( [ eq : kttev ] ) must vanish as @xmath72 .",
    "this will happen only if the limit of ( [ eq : divterms ] ) is zero , which , given the results deduced above , can only happen if @xmath102 .",
    "the evolution of the scalar field is accomplished through two auxiliary variables , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "these are defined by ( [ eq : defphi ] ) .",
    "the condition on @xmath103 has already been stated in  ( [ eq : phiprime ] ) @xmath105 and it is easy to show that @xmath104 must be even in @xmath3 near the origin .",
    "thus we have @xmath106    .[tab : fdop]two - level finite difference operators [ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     unfortunately , these regularity conditions are inconsistent with the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "if we solve  ( [ eq : ham ] ) for @xmath107 , take a radial derivative of the resulting expression , then take the @xmath72 limit , we find : @xmath108 thus , we are lead to the conclusion that the mmief coordinate system will admit no non - singular curvature at the origin .",
    "the only consistent solutions near the origin describe flat space or a black hole .",
    "thus , mmief is a `` good '' coordinate system to use only when a black hole already exists in the spacetime . in a spacetime without a black hole , the equations will remain consistent as long as no matter encounters the origin",
    ". this will be the case if the scalar field is outgoing or if it collapses to form a black hole before it encounters the origin . for a collapse problem",
    ", we could start with another coordinate system and change to mmief coordinates if an apparent horizon forms .",
    "if no such horizon forms , there is really no need for the special horizon tracking properties of mmief coordinates anyway .",
    "though we have not implemented such a scheme , this approach was used successfully in @xcite .",
    "we use equations ( [ eq : aev ] ) , ( [ eq : kttev ] ) , ( [ eq : phiev ] ) , ( [ eq : piev ] ) , and ( [ eq : fdot ] ) to evolve @xmath74 , @xmath109 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath12 ; equation ( [ eq : mom ] ) to find @xmath76 ; and equation ( [ eq : betadef ] ) to find @xmath8 .",
    "we solve these equations using finite difference techniques on a uniform mesh with spacings @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where the courant factor @xmath112 , is held fixed when we change the basic scale of discretization .",
    "table [ tab : fdop ] shows the operators we use in the discretizations . note that while the derivative operators take a lower precedence than the arithmetic operators , that is @xmath113 , the time averaging operator takes a higher precedence , that is @xmath114 and @xmath115 .    in the interior ,",
    "the finite difference equations are : @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 these equations are applied everywhere in the interior except at the two points next to the boundary points . at these points , we use the same equations except the dissipative time derivatives ( @xmath124 ) are replaced by regular time derivatives ( @xmath125 ) , since the value at @xmath126 or @xmath127 is not available at these locations .",
    "it is interesting to note that all of the spatial derivatives are _ angled _ ( @xmath128 ) except for the derivative of @xmath8 in equation ( [ eq : fdkttin ] ) and the derivative of @xmath75 in equation ( [ eq : fdkrrin ] ) .",
    "switching any of these derivatives from angled to non - angled or from non - angled to angled results in an instability .",
    "we do nt have an explanation for why this particular combination of derivatives works , but the use of angled derivatives here was motivated by their successful application in previous work by choptuik ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is a good example of a technique that was perfected by `` experimental '' numerical analysis .",
    "as discussed previously , the inner boundary of our computational domain is fixed to the apparent horizon , @xmath41 . in accord with the causal properties of the apparent horizon , function values on the horizon",
    "can be advanced without use of any information defined at @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath41 we use the same equations employed in the interior , except that we replace centered differences with forward differences .",
    "for example , equation ( [ eq : fdain ] ) becomes @xmath130    since the computational grid does not extend to infinity .",
    "we adopt outgoing conditions at the outer boundary , that is , we assume that no radiation will enter the grid from large @xmath3 . while this is not strictly true ( there will be curvature back - scattering from the outgoing pulse ) , this assumption provides a reasonable computational solution .",
    "for the scalar field variables @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the outgoing conditions come from the condition on @xmath73 , namely @xmath131 , with @xmath132 being the speed of the outgoing waves .",
    "this means that @xmath133 and @xmath134 these equations are discretized as @xmath135 and @xmath136^n_i + \\frac{1 - 2\\mu_t\\beta^n_i+\\delta_ts^n_i } { \\mu_ts^n_i}\\mu_t\\phi^n_i = 0.\\ ] ]    we can get approximate conditions on @xmath74 and @xmath75 from their schwarzschild forms ( [ eq : schlapse ] ) and ( [ eq : schktt ] ) with the mass aspect ( [ eq : mass3 ] ) used in place of @xmath52 , since in vacuum , or in any region where the scalar field s self - gravitation is negligible , @xmath74 and @xmath80 should take on these forms . for large @xmath10 , asymptotic expansion of these expressions gives : @xmath137 and @xmath138 thus , at large @xmath10 we have , to leading order @xmath139 and @xmath140 we now deduce how @xmath62 behaves in the large @xmath10 , weak - field limit . since @xmath141 and @xmath142 we have @xmath143 from the condition on @xmath73 we can see that @xmath144 and @xmath145 , where @xmath146 .",
    "thus @xmath147 that is , m is `` outgoing '' at large @xmath10 . therefore we get the following conditions for @xmath74 and @xmath75 : @xmath148 and @xmath149 these are discretized as @xmath150 and @xmath151    the outgoing boundary condition reduces the amplitude of reflections off the boundary , but unless the boundary is placed at very large @xmath3 , these reflections can still interfere with the results of a calculation . to further reduce the reflections",
    ", we use a _ sponge filter _ as detailed in @xcite .",
    "briefly , this means that in the interior of the grid , we add a term to the wave equation which effectively applies the outgoing condition on a finite region rather than at a single radial location .",
    "for instance , we use the following modified evolution equation for @xmath103 : @xmath152,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficient function , @xmath153 , is given by @xmath154 in the filtering region , @xmath155 , and vanishes elsewhere . here , @xmath156 and @xmath0 are parameters which can be adjusted to tune the filter .",
    "[ fig : sponge ] shows @xmath157 for @xmath158 and @xmath159 , the values used in this work .",
    "we wish to examine the interactions of the black hole with compact ingoing pulses of scalar field .",
    "we can generate nearly ingoing pulses using the following method .",
    "let @xmath160 .",
    "this gives @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "for a compact pulse , we set @xmath163 to a guassian of the form @xmath164 where @xmath165 is an integer , and @xmath166 is the radial coordinate of the center of the pulse .",

    "ostensibly , @xmath172 can be freely specified and the constraints can still be satisfied by appropriate adjustments to the other geometric variables . however , an _ arbitrarily _ chosen @xmath172 combined with the initial data for the scalar field given by ( [ eq : phiinit])([eq : piinit ] ) will not , in general , generate a spacetime describing the desired physical scenario of a scalar pulse initially infalling on a black hole .",
    "we therefore adopt an ansatz for @xmath172 which is motivated by the observation that at the initial time , the self - gravitation of the scalar field is generally relatively weak , and thus the geometric variables should have approximately their schwarzschild form .",
    "specifically , we demand that @xmath172 satisfy the following equation ( see ( [ eq : schktt ] ) ) : @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the mass aspect function defined by ( [ eq : mass3 ] ) .",
    "this equation , along with the equation for the mass aspect ( [ eq : mass3 ] ) and the constraints ( [ eq : ham ] ) and ( [ eq : mom ] ) , is then solved iteratively for any given initial scalar field configuration .",
    "we have found that initial data prepared in this manner _ does _ generate spacetimes of the type we seek even when the scalar field is significantly self - gravitating at the initial time .",
    "in order to assess the correctness and accuracy of our difference equations and the program which solves them , we perform some tests .",
    "these include computing convergence factors , performing a long - time vacuum ( schwarzschild ) evolution and comparing it to the known solution , and performing a long - time strong - field evolution .",
    "to measure convergence , we define the convergence factor for a grid function @xmath175 by @xmath176 where @xmath177 is a solution of the finite difference equations on a grid with spacing @xmath24 , and the @xmath178 norm is defined in the usual way , that is @xmath179 .",
    "these factors are computed from a strong - field evolution .",
    "they are approximately four throughout , indicating second order convergence .",
    "[ fig : schdiff ] shows the deviation of the evolved vacuum spacetime from that of schwarzschild .",
    "we note however , that the spacetime being evolved is not schwarzschild , rather it is a black hole in a `` box '' with rather _ ad hoc _ boundary conditions .    at late times",
    ", the outer boundary condition causes the spacetime to `` drift '' away from the initial configuration .",
    "[ fig : riccimass ] shows plots of the mass and the ricci scalar for vacuum evolutions with outer boundaries at @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 .",
    "this plot clearly shows the rather large effect the position of the outer boundary has on the late - time evolution .",
    "we could get better convergence of the difference solution to the continuum solution ( i.e. with boundary conditions only at spatial infinity ) by matching the interior cauchy evolution to an exterior characteristic evolution ( see @xcite ) or by using an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm to push the the outer boundary to a large radius without unduly increasing the computational load .",
    "nevertheless , the position of the outer boundary has no effect on stability .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : longricci ] .",
    "the curves in this graph are asymptoting to fixed values .",
    "thus , although the computed spacetime drifts from schwarzschild , it eventually reaches a fixed configuration .",
    "[ fig : long ] shows the @xmath178 norm of the scalar field during a strong field evolution to @xmath183 .",
    "[ fig : longmr ] shows the mass and the ricci scalar for the same evolution .",
    "while the scalar field and the mass fall off as expected , the plot of the ricci scalar again shows the `` drifting '' of the geometry .",
    "the plots of the ricci scalar were made by discretizing to first order , the analytic expression for @xmath184 derived in the usual way by @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the ricci tensor .",
    "although the values of @xmath184 appear large given that they are computed for a vacuum spacetime , they do converge to zero to first order in the mesh spacing as expected .",
    "moreover , the values of the individual additive terms in the expression for @xmath184 are orders of magnitude larger than the scalar itself , indicating that @xmath184 is the size we would expect for first order differencing at these resolutions .",
    "as discussed in sec .  [ sec : id ] we focus study on the evolution of initially ingoing `` gaussian '' pulses of scalar radiation . in this case , the infalling field exhibits two limiting behaviors , dependent on the amplitude and width of the pulse .",
    "these are : _ scattering _ from the existing black hole and _ collapse _ to form a new horizon outside the existing horizon .",
    "generically , these two behaviors are separated by a _ critical _ value of either amplitude or width . fig .",
    "[ fig : spacetime ] shows the path of the apparent horizon for various amplitudes of initial data .",
    "the final mass of the black hole should scale as a power of the amplitude of the initial pulse . to find out what this power should be , we can use equation ( [ eq : minf ] ) .",
    "since the mass is conserved , @xmath70 is a constant .",
    "however , @xmath52 is not constant . as the scalar field encounters the horizon ,",
    "some mass will be transferred from the integral term to @xmath52 .",
    "the mass of the black hole will increase by an amount proportional to the mass in the scalar field . by this",
    "we mean that after the interaction we have @xmath187 where @xmath188 is a positive constant less than @xmath189 .",
    "for a very narrow pulse , the entire mass of the field will go into the black hole , and hence , @xmath188 will be very close to @xmath189 . if the pulse if very wide , however , @xmath188 will be very close to @xmath190 .",
    "thus , to see how the final mass of the black hole scales with the amplitude of the scalar pulse , we need only examine the integral term in equation ( [ eq : mincr ] ) .",
    "from equations ( [ eq : phiinit])-([eq : piinit ] ) we see that @xmath103 and @xmath104 are proportional to @xmath73 and hence to @xmath156 .",
    "this means that the integrand is proportional to @xmath191 .",
    "this of course assumes the dependence of @xmath74 , @xmath80 , and @xmath8 on @xmath73 is much less than the dependence of @xmath192 on @xmath73 .",
    "while this seems a reasonable assumption , it must be checked numerically in the strong field regime .",
    "our numerical results verify this calculation .",
    "for instance , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : massd2all ] is fit by the line @xmath193 indicating that the mass grows with the square of the amplitude as expected .",
    "the graph also shows there is no difference in behavior for sub- and super - critical data .",
    "that is , the final mass of the black hole exhibits the same dependence on the amplitude when the hole grows by accretion as when it forms by collapse .    similarly , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : massd4all ] is fit by the line @xmath194 indicating that the mass scaling is independent of the exact shape of the ingoing pulse .",
    "[ fig : tails ] shows @xmath73 at constant @xmath3 for runs with @xmath195 .",
    "it is clear that the position of the outer boundary has a large effect on the late - time fall - off of the scalar field .",
    "even with the sponge filter , there is enough reflection from the outer boundary to cause the field to die off more slowly than it otherwise would .",
    "however , with the outer boundary at @xmath196 , it takes at least @xmath197 for reflections from the scattered pulse to travel in from the outer boundary and interfere with measurements at @xmath198 , and still longer for reflections to interfere with measurements at the horizon .",
    "this should provide enough time to accurately measure the rate of fall - off of the scalar field .",
    "[ fig : tail ] shows the evolution of @xmath73 at @xmath198 and at the horizon up until @xmath199 .",
    "a fit to the @xmath198 curve between @xmath200 and @xmath197 shows @xmath73 falling off as @xmath201 .",

    "[ sec : tails ]    linearized perturbation theory predicts these exponents should both be @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "we note that previous evolutions carried out by gundlach , price , and pullin gave exponents between @xmath204 and @xmath205 for @xmath73 at constant @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "figs . [ fig : wphi1]-[fig : wphi4 ] show the waveforms generated by the scattering of packets of various widths and amplitudes . the scalar field is measured both at the horizon and at @xmath206 .",
    "the oscillation period in each of these figures is approximately @xmath207 , and is independent of initial amplitude and pulse width .",
    "gundlach _ et . al .",
    "_ measured an oscillation period of approximately @xmath208 @xcite during collapse of gaussian wave packets .",
    "certain evolutions exhibit interesting effects which result from the use of mmief coordinates .",
    "recall that the shift component , @xmath8 satisfies  ( [ eq : betadef ] ) . at the apparent horizon , ( [ eq : mmiefaphor ] ) holds so we have @xmath209 from this we can see that when no matter is crossing the horizon , @xmath210 so the outgoing characteristic speed ( [ eq : charspeed ] ) is zero , as it must be since the tracked surface is marginally trapped .",
    "however , if @xmath211 , then @xmath212 and the outgoing characteristic speed is @xmath213 . in this case",
    ", the light cone is degenerate .",
    "in fact , from ( [ eq : betadef ] ) we can see that if @xmath211 , then @xmath212 _ everywhere_. does @xmath50 ever equal one ?",
    "the most likely place for this to happen is the critical solution because that is when the `` maximum '' amount of energy is crossing the horizon for a given pulse shape .",
    "the values of @xmath8 at the horizon and at the outer boundary are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : betaio ] for a near - critical solution .",
    "@xmath8 gets as large as @xmath214 , but never reaches 1 .",
    "a near - critical solution from a family of pulses with @xmath215 gives a slightly higher maximum @xmath8 , but still less than 1 .",
    "it may be possible that a narrow enough pulse could cause @xmath50 to reach 1 for an instant , but this has not been verified",
    ". furthermore , it may be that such a narrow pulse would collapse to form a new horizon before crossing the existing horizon .",
    "nevertheless , whenever @xmath216 , the outgoing characteristic speed is negative .",
    "thus , outgoing pulses will appear to move inward when plotted in the radial coordinate , @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : mcdmdr ] shows an evolution of @xmath217 for the critical solution described above .",
    "there are two periods of backwards motion ; one at about @xmath218 and the other at about @xmath219 .",
    "these are the times when each of the `` bumps '' crosses the horizon .",
    "the retrograde motion is easier to see in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] which shows contours of @xmath217 on a spacetime plot for the same evolution .",
    "[ fig : m6dmdr ] shows a fairly weak field evolution of @xmath217 for comparison .",
    "there is no retrograde motion in this case .    to completely remove these coordinate motion effects",
    ", we can abandon the shifted areal coordinate @xmath10 and use the usual ief coordinates . in this case",
    ", @xmath3 is areal again so @xmath220 instead of @xmath221 .",
    "the evolution and constraint equations are trivially derived from equations ( [ eq : ham])-([eq : piev ] ) with the substitutions @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "note that the function @xmath39 no longer appears .",
    "such a coordinate choice has the additional benefit of slightly simplifying the equations .",
    "however , the inner boundary of the grid will not be tied to the apparent horizon as it is in mmief coordinates .",
    "this causes no problems in practice .",
    "as matter crosses the horizon and the black hole grows , some of the inner grid points are `` lost '' into the black hole and we simply stop applying our difference equations there . since the radial coordinate is areal , the growth of the black hole is bounded by the total mass of the spacetime , so there is no danger of having a large fraction of the grid fall into the hole . the previous one - dimensional black hole excising calculations @xcite used horizon - locked radial coordinates so that once the apparent horizon formed , no further grid points would fall into the hole .",
    "thus , they should be expected to exhibit similar coordinate motion effects to those seen in the calculations using mmief coordinates .",
    "[ fig : iefcomp ] shows a comparison of @xmath73 evolved in ief coordinates with @xmath73 evolved in mmief coordinates for a strong - field case .",
    "the two match closely with differences caused by small differences in the positions of the inner boundary .",
    "there is a sharp `` bump '' at the front of the outgoing pulse in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcdmdr ] .",
    "this feature is absent from the weak - field evolution of fig .",
    "[ fig : m6dmdr ] and is certainly amplitude dependent . fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdr10b ] shows a series of initial pulse shapes for data with various amplitudes all centered at @xmath224 .",
    "[ fig : dmdr10a ] shows the corresponding pulse shapes after scattering .",
    "although this bump occurs at the front of the scattered pulse , it is not caused by interactions with the black hole . to see this more clearly",
    ", we can start the pulse further out and see what happens . figs . [ fig : dmdr20b ] and [ fig : dmdr20a ] show pulse shapes at @xmath225 and @xmath226 for data with @xmath227 .",
    "the outgoing bump develops for large amplitude data without any help from the black hole .",
    "a similar bump develops for initial data with @xmath215 .",
    "these bumps always have the same characteristic shape , though their widths may vary .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdr10a ] that the amplitude of this outgoing feature does not depend linearly on the initial amplitude of the pulse .",
    "for instance , from fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdr10b ] , the height of the highest peak is about 1.5 times the height of the next highest peak , while their widths are the same .",
    "however , the amplitude of the outgoing feature in the first case is about 2.5 times the amplitude of the outgoing feature in the second case , while their widths are the same .",
    "figures [ fig : dmdr20b ] and [ fig : dmdr20a ] show similar nonlinear behavior for the pulses centered at @xmath228 .",
    "it is difficult to tell whether this feature is caused by the nonlinear interaction of an outgoing piece of the initial data with the rest of the pulse , or if it is caused by back - scattering from the effective self - potential of the ingoing pulse .",
    "further study is needed .",
    "we have shown that the a _ null _ based slicing works well with an apparent horizon boundary condition , and results in a program which is stable and convergent and will run forever .",
    "further , we have examined the coordinate motion effects which result from this coordinate system and ways to avoid them .",
    "we have also seen an interesting nonlinear feature in the self - gravitating scalar field .",
    "while the calculations presented in this paper were carried out in spherical symmetry , the coordinate system can be generalized to multi - dimensions .",
    "we have worked out an extension to the case of a kerr black hole in 3 dimensions ( see @xcite ) , the details of which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "unfortunately , this coordinate system can not be applied globally to spacetimes which contain more than one black hole since it depends on the notion of an areal coordinate . nevertheless , this technique is useful for problems involving various matter fields and single black holes .",
    "for instance , it could be used to investigate the stability properties of the solution found by bechmann and lechtenfeld @xcite in their investigation of the scalar no - hair theorem ( see @xcite for work in this direction ) .",
