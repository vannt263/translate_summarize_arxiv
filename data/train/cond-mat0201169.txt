    "it is also obvious from eqs.([hp25])-([hp26 ] ) that the phase transition in heterogeneity parameter is more appropriately realized in a system of flexible chains @xmath72 rather than in stiff @xmath73 chains solution because the limit @xmath74 is easier reached in the first case .",
    "one can obtain from eqs.([di22])-([di24 ] ) that near the critical point the renormalized correlation length diverges as @xmath75 so , for the critical exponent of the correlation length in the phase @xmath76 we obtain the mean field result .",
    "this means that tree approximation that we used in eqs .",

    "so , we obtain a non - trivial field - theoretical model .",
    "expanding @xmath108 in heterogeneity parameter @xmath109 one can reproduce the impurity diagrams in eq .",
    "( [ di20 ] ) .",
    "so we map the concentrated random heteropolymer solution problem onto the @xmath0 vector model at @xmath1 .",
    "this model is well studied @xcite and we can use it s results . remind that the problem of self - avoiding walk of a single polymer chain is also mapped to this model @xcite .",
    "however there is an important difference between these two problems . in our case",
    "the ordered phase @xmath92 ( see below ) also exists in contrary the former one where the criticality is reached in the limit of long chains @xmath110 .",
    "thus , we have the following behavior for the correlation function in the phase @xmath76 . when @xmath111 correlation function at large distances exponentially decreases with some correlation length .",
    "at @xmath74 correlation length diverges @xmath112 .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath113 is well known from the @xmath114 and from the numerical calculations @xmath115 , for three and two dimensions , respectively . at the critical point",
    "the correlation function has a power law behavior @xmath116 .",
    "the exponent @xmath117 is also well known for @xmath0 model .",
    "this power law behavior is preserved also in the ordered phase in three dimenions . in two dimensions",
    "there are some peculiarities in the ordered phase .",
    "it follows from the preceding consideration that the phase transition is caused by the `` massless '' fluctuations . in the vicinity of the critical point",
    "we can simplify the action of eq.([ft44 ] ) by separating the `` massless '' fluctuations .",
    "for this reason we find saddle - point trajectories of the action of eq .",
    "( [ ft44 ] ) . differentiating ( [ ft44 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath118 we are looking for the homogeneous solution of eq .",
    "( [ ft45 ] ) , @xmath119 @xmath120 this equation has two solutions @xmath121    it can be seen from eq.([ft47 ] ) that the second type of saddle points lies in the complex plane . in the stationary phase method",
    "it is well known that in such cases one must transform the integration contour so that it passes through the saddle points ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we have in mind that the integration contour is transformed locally at each point @xmath122 . along",
    "the new contour @xmath123 has the form @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is real .",
    "suppose that the fluctuating fields locally satisfy the extremum condition of eq .",
    "( [ ft47 ] ) . making a change of variables",
    "@xmath126 , we obtain the following expression for the effective action describing the `` massless '' fluctuations @xmath127 where @xmath128 here , for brevity , we omit the index @xmath129 and neglect the constant terms in action that do not affect the critical behavior .",
    "so , the critical behavior of random heteropolymer solution is described by the non - linear @xmath130 model at @xmath1 . the coupling constant of the model of eq .",
    "( [ ft48 ] ) is @xmath131 .",
    "the region @xmath76 corresponds to the high temperature phase of @xmath1 vector model @xcite . note that our derivation of @xmath130 model from the @xmath132 model is correct in the high temperature phase @xmath76 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that at the critical point the correlation functions of the non - linear @xmath130-model and @xmath132 theory are identical .",
    "however @xmath132 model is renormalizable at @xmath133 but @xmath130 model is renormalizable only at @xmath134 .",
    "so , in the critical domain for @xmath53 one can use the non - linear @xmath130-model instead of the @xmath132-model . the ordered phase @xmath92 will be described by the low - temperature phase of the non - linear @xmath130-model at @xmath1 .",
    "however the coupling constant in this case differs from that of eq.([ft49 ] ) .",
    "it will be proportional to the expectation value of the order parameter which is non - zero in the ordered phase @xcite .",
    "note that this transition to the low - temperature phase of @xmath1 vector model in two - dimension is caused by the heterogeneity of chains and not by dense polymer self - avoiding walks @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature phase of @xmath1 vector model has many unusual properties .",
    "one of them is the increasing of spin - spin correlation function with distance @xcite . in our case",
    "this means that in the phase @xmath92 the correlation function will increase with distance .",
    "the corresponding power index is @xmath135 @xcite . in the dense polymer case such a behavior",
    "is explained by the repelling of the extremities of chains . to understand this result for",
    "the heteropolymer solution , consider the case when each chain consists of only two kinds of monomers ( see appendix ) . in this case",
    "there will be three excluded volume constants @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "suppose that the excluded volume constants between monomers largely differ from each other so that @xmath137 , @xmath139 ( see also appendix ) . in order to minimize the conformotional energy ,",
    "type @xmath18 monomer prefers contact with type @xmath18 monomers .",
    "this means that the compensation of excluded volume interactions leading to the screening effect in polymer solutions will be violated in random heteropolymer solution .",
    "moreover , the strong repulsion between different kinds of monomers will lead to the microphase separation like the analogous effect in single random heteropolymers ( see@xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although these papers mainly dealt with the compact conformations of single random heteropolymers ( which is the case @xmath140 , in our case always @xmath141 ) , nevertheless we think that these two phenomena are closely related .",
    "the microphase separation is the main reason of the rise of anti - correlations in heteropolymer solutions in two dimensions and power law decreasing of correlation function in three dimensions .",
    "we have considered the effect of random heterogeneity on the density - density correlation function of dense polymer solutions .",
    "it turns out that a phase transition is possible due to the heterogeneity of the polymer chains .",
    "the heterogeneity parameter is determined by the ratio of variance and average values of excluded volume constant .",
    "the critical behavior is described by the o(n ) vector model at @xmath1 .",
    "the anti- correlation behavior of correlation function in two dimensions and the power law behavior in three dimensions in the ordered phase are associated with the microphase separation .",
    "1.0 cm using ( [ in2 ] ) , one can represent the fluctuating part of excluded volume energy in the form @xmath142 suppose that @xmath30 are independent random variables with variance @xmath143 . then for the large number of monomers because of the central limit theorem",
