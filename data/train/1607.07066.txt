    "e.g. , pl , absorption , reflection , or scattered light intensity are measured as a function of the photon s momentum vector ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these techniques utilize imaging in the back focal plane ( fourier plane ) of a microscope objective ( see appendix a ) .",
    "every point in the back focal plane corresponds to an angle of light incident on or emitted from the sample ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 ) ; see fig .  2 for the measurement geometry .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "3(a ) we plot the p - polarized mpl from a thin film of p(ndi2od - t2 ) . following previously established procedures , @xcite we decompose mpl measurements like these into contributions from in - plane and out - of - plane oriented emission dipoles .",
    "similarly , we also extend this basic technique to measure the orientation of _ absorption _ dipoles .",
    "incident light is focused to a point in the back focal plane , fig .",
    "3(b ) , such that it impinges the sample at a specific angle .",
    "by moving this focused light source within the back focal plane , we have complete control of the incident photon momentum vector and can measure momentum - resolved absorption .",
    "both pl and absorption measurements are analyzed with simple electromagnetic models , detailed below .    because the emission ( and absorption ) distribution of a dipole is anisotropic ( @xmath6 ) , dipoles that are oriented in the plane of the sample ( in - plane for the rest of the article )",
    "emit light into ( or absorb light from ) different angles than dipoles oriented perpendicular to the sample plane ( out - of - plane ) .",
    "these differences are further amplified by reflections and interference in multi - layered geometries .",
    "using a three - layer optical model , we calculate the p - polarized momentum - dependent pl intensity from purely in - plane ( blue , solid ) or out - of - plane ( red , dashed ) dipoles in a p(ndi2od - t2 ) film , fig .",
    "the distributions are particularly different at normal incidence , where only in - plane ( ip ) dipoles emit , and at the critical angle , where only out - of - plane dipoles ( op ) emit .",
    "we use these calculations to decompose measured momentum - resolved pl into contributions from ip and op dipoles , fig .",
    "the 2d back focal plane pl image is focused to the entrance slit of an imaging spectrograph where it is separated spectrally . at each wavelength",
    "we measure the pl intensity as a function of in - plane momentum ( black circles ) .",
    "the measured counts are decomposed into contributions from ip ( blue , solid ) and op ( red , dashed ) dipoles . in this case , 5 percent of the total pl counts originate from op dipoles .",
    "0.9     measured ( solid , dot - dashed ) and calculated ( dashed ) p - polarized ( yellow , solid ) and s - polarized ( cyan , dot - dash ) 865 nm pl traces for face - on and edge - on films are shown in figs .",
    "5(a , b ) .",
    "the s - polarized calculations contain no free fit parameters and show excellent agreement with measured pl up to approximately @xmath7 .",
    "this value of @xmath8 defines the range over which we perform fits of p - pol dataat larger momentum values the collection efficiency of the microscope objective begins to drop .",
    "the p - polarized experimental traces are fit according to the calculations described above , providing a measure of the relative contribution of in - plane and out - of - plane dipoles .",
    "as expected for excitations oriented primarily along the polymer chain , the emission in both morphologies is dominated by an in - plane dipole moment .",
    "however , fits of the p - polarized pl traces reveal a significant difference between the two morphologies .",
    "the ratio of out - of - plane to in - plane dipole moments is more than twice as large for edge - on ( 0.29 ) than face - on ( 0.13 ) morphologies .",
    "mpl allows us to resolve differences in the optical anisotropies that are _ not _ evident in ellipsometry ( supplemental material , fig .",
    "s2 ) .    from mpl",
    "we derive the orientation of the transition dipole moment ( tdm ) with respect to the substrate .",
    "the ratio of op to ip dipole moments translate into differences of the average inclination angle of the tdm with respect to the substrate .",
    "the inferred angle is @xmath9 for face - on films compared to @xmath10 for edge - on orientations .",
    "this increase in angle is consistent with the orientation of ndi planes in face - on versus edge - on films .",
    "dft calculations indicate a tdm is oriented mostly , but not completely , parallel to the polymer backbone .",
    "the tdm is tilted ( 8) in the ndi plane , see fig .",
    "1(b).@xcite in the edge - on morphology , the tdm is thus partially aligned perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "there may also be a tilting of the polymer backbone with respect to the substrate.@xcite and we can not unambiguously identify the cause of differences in tdm orientation between the two morphologies .",
    "it is worth noting that the optical technique used here averages both crystalline and amorphous regions and therefore provides different information than can be found from x - ray diffraction alone .    from lorentz reciprocity@xcite ,",
    "momentum - resolved light absorption is formally equivalent to momentum - resolved emission . using the same principles described above , we provide the first demonstrations of momentum - resolved photoluminescence excitation ( mple ) , a proxy for absorption ( assuming photoluminescence intensity is linearly proportional to the amount of light absorbed ) .",
    "we collect the total emitted pl ( integrated over wavelength and momentum ) as a function of the position of our momentum - resolved laser excitation source , fig .",
    "face - on and edge - on mple measurements are plotted in figs .",
    "5(c ) and ( d ) at an excitation wavelength of 700 nm .",
    "fitting these traces to the appropriate in - plane and out - of - plane basis functions at 700 nm ( see appendix c ) , we find out - of - plane to in - plane ratios of 0.16 and 0.30 for face - on and edge - on morphologies respectively .",
    "this excellent agreement with momentum - resolved emission ( 0.13 and 0.29 ) further validates our observation of larger tdm tilt - angles for edge - on polymer films .",
    "this also indicates minimal reorientation of the transition dipole between absorption and emission processes as can occur in other systems.@xcite      0.9     the wavelength dependence of these momentum - resolved measurements provides additional insight into the differences in optical properties for the two film morphologies .",
    "we only determine mple ( i.e. , absorption ) at an excitation wavelength of 700 nm .",
    "the emitted light , on the other hand , is separated by momentum and wavelength simultaneously .",
    "performing decompositions similar to fig .",
    "4(b ) , we observe an average op / ip ratio of 0.12 with a standard deviation of 0.1 across the pl band ( 750 - 1050 nm ) for face - on films . although the ratio is _ mostly _ constant across the pl spectrum , deviations from these values are observed primarily at wavelengths to the right of the pl peak .",
    "this deviation is most easily visualized by plotting the normalized ip and op spectra inferred from our fits at each wavelength . for face - on films , fig .",
    "6(a ) , the s - polarized spectrum ( light green ) , which arises from only ip dipoles , is in close agreement with the ip spectrum determined from fits of p - polarized data ( blue , solid ) . in particular , both spectra reveal a shoulder feature at 950 nm that is absent from the op spectrum ( red , dashed ) determined from our fits . in comparison ,",
    "edge - on films , fig .",
    "6(b ) show much closer agreement between all three spectra ( the out - of - plane artifact past 1000 nm is due to low pl counts throwing off the fitting procedure ) .",
    "evidently , the spectral dependence of these optical anisotropies reveals subtle differences in the morphology - dependent optical properties that are otherwise obscured .    in previous studies , this 950 nm shoulder peak",
    "was only seen in aggregated p(ndi2od - t2).@xcite .",
    "a likely explanation for the missing face - on shoulder peak is that out - of - plane oriented dipoles are preferentially found in amorphous regions of the sample .",
    "when the polymer is initially spin - cast onto the substrate most of the molecules aggregate and align in the plane of the substrate . some molecules , however",
    ", will exist in amorphous regions where there is a more random orientation of the molecules .",
    "the low temperature anneal provides only a small amount of energy for the molecules to rearrange and very little of the amorphous regions will crystallize . in this scenario out - of - plane dipoles are preferentially found in these randomly oriented amorphous regions .",
    "in contrast , a high temperature anneal , which gives rise to the edge - on morphology , has much more energy for the molecules to adjust and crystallize .",
    "a large portion of the amorphous polymers will crystallize while mostly retaining their original orientation .",
    "this simple model likely explains why the 950 nm shoulder peak is found in the out - of - plane spectra for edge - on , but not face - on , morphologies .",
    "in conclusion we use momentum - resolved spectroscopies to measure in - plane and out - of - plane effective dipole moments for face - on and edge - on morphologies of p(ndi2od - t2 ) .",
    "fits of momentum - resolved emission measurements ( mpl ) show close agreement with first - ever analogous absorption measurements using a momentum - resolved photoluminescence excitation ( mple ) technique .",
    "we find that edge - on films exhibit a larger out - of - plane tilt angle ( @xmath11 16 ) of the transition dipole moment relative to face - on films ( @xmath11 7 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the orientation of the transition dipole moment within ndi planes , but may alternatively be indicative of a difference in average orientation of the polymer backbones . we also observe a missing shoulder peak , characteristic of aggregated p(ndi2od - t2 ) , in the out - of - plane emission spectrum of face - on films .",
    "this suggests that the out - of - plane emission in these films arises largely from amorphous regions . as typical optical techniques",
    "only measure in - plane oriented dipoles and x - ray diffraction only measures crystalline regions of the film , these out - of - plane amorphous regions have likely been unexplored in previous studies .",
    "finding annealing techniques that maintain face - on orientation while crystallizing these previously hidden regions will likely lead to better charge transport and , therefore , device performance in organic photovoltaics and light - emitting diodes .",
    "in addition to these insights on p(ndi2od - t2 ) s morphology , the momentum - resolved techniques developed in this paper can be used to accurately characterize anisotropic optical properties in other materials .",
    "these techniques can therefore enable new optimizations of optical device design and reveal subtle differences in morphology that are obscured in other x - ray and optical characterization techniques .",

    ", we separate light based on the angle , or momentum , at which it leaves the sample . a spectrometer ( princeton instruments isoplane sct320 ) coupled to a 2d ccd camera",
    "( princeton instruments pixis 1024brx ) separates light by wavelength along one axis of the camera and momentum along the other axis .",
    "this allows measurements of momentum - dependent photoluminescence intensity at many wavelengths simultaneously . from this data , we separate emission spectra from dipoles oriented in - plane and out - of - plane . for mpl experiments we used a collimated led source ( thorlabs m735l3-c5 ) to excite the sample across all momenta uniformly .",
    "similarly to how placing a detector in a conjugate back focal plane to the objective allowed us to study emission of different momenta of light , we placed our excitation source in another conjugate back focal plane to study absorption as a function of light momenta .",
    "we studied absorption properties by measuring the integrated intensity of photoluminescence emitted from the sample versus the input excitation momentum ( similar to how photoluminescence excitation , or ple , measures pl versus input wavelength of light ) .",
    "the end of a single mode optical fiber ( coming from a fiber - coupled supercontinuum source ( superk extreme exr-15 ) ) was mounted on a translation stage . by moving the end of the fiber within the conjugate back focal plane ,",
    "we control the incident momentum vector of the light exciting the sample .",
    "p(ndi2od - t2 ) ( polyera activink n2200 ) was spin - cast from 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution ( ) .",
    "samples were then annealed at for one hour to produce face - on samples or at for one hour to produce edge - on samples .",
    "the samples were then allowed to slowly cool to room temperature .",
    "film thickness was measured using atomic force microscopy ( afm ) .",
    "glass , 200 nm silicon dioxide on silicon , and quartz coverslip substrates were used for afm , ellipsometry , and pl measurements respectively .",
    "raw camera images were analyzed using python . in mpl",
    "we obtain a rectangular image with wavelength varying along the x - axis and momentum varying along the y - axis . to obtain in - plane and out - of - plane emission dipole moments we analyzed each wavelength independently . for a given wavelength column in the p - polarized image",
    ", we first converted the pixels of the camera into units of @xmath12 by setting the edges of pl to the 1.3 na ( @xmath13 ) of our microscope objective . after converting to units of momentum we used a three layer model ( following the treatment in schuller _ _ et al.__@xcite ) to solve for the linear combination of in - plane and out - of - plane effective emission dipole moments that summed to the intensity vs. momentum shape measured at each wavelength .",
    "the model s input parameters  refractive index and film thickness  were determined from ellipsometry and afm measurements respectively . after fitting p - polarized data ,",
    "we determine the expected s - polarized pl intensity vs. momentum and compare to actual s - polarized measurements .",
    "data analysis for mple was similar , but had many separate images that needed to be aggregated .",
    "for each pl image the exciting laser y - position was determined by taking the image of the reflected laser spot without the pl filter .",
    "each pl image was background subtracted using a `` window frame '' of dark pixels that surrounded the pixels receiving pl in the center of the image .",
    "this allowed us to correct for background drift over time .",
    "the background subtracted pl image was then summed across all pixels to determine a single pl value for each image . from the pl image we were able to convert pixels to @xmath12 as above .",
    "we then found the linear combination of in - plane and out - of - plane effective absorption dipole moments that summed to the counts vs. momentum shape observed .",
    "again , we determine the expected s - polarized pl intensity vs. incident momentum and compare to actual s - polarized measurements .",
    "it is important to note that while the mpl model includes an apodization factor , given the setup geometry the mple model does not . in mpl , each pixel of fixed width in the back - focal - plane correspond to a different magnitude of solid - angle over which the pl is collected .",
    "thus , an isotropic emitter would still exhibit intensity variations across the back focal plane image . in mple ,",
    "the solid - angle magnitude also changes , but the input power is fixed and no correction is needed .",
    "dipole moments found via mpl and mple are highly sensitive to the film refractive indices input in the three - layer model ( especially in the out - of - plane direction ) .",
    "for this reason it is essential to have accurate optical constants .",
    "we used atomic force microscopy , uv - vis transmission , and ellipsometry to get accurate thickness , in - plane extinction coefficient , and refractive indices respectively .",
