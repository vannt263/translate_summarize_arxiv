    "blazars are identified as optically violent variable ( ovv ) quasars ( a sub - class of flat spectrum radio quasars , fsrq ) and bl lacs which may be low - frequency or high - frequency peaked bl  lac objects .",
    "their broad - band spectra consist of two spectral components which appear as broad ` humps ' in the spectral energy distribution , and are due to emission from a jet oriented at small angle with respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "the low - energy component is generally believed to be synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons , and extends from the radio to uv or x - ray frequencies .",
    "the origin of the high - energy component , from x - ray to @xmath6-ray energies , in some cases to several tev , is still under debate .",
    "various models have been proposed , with the most popular ones being the `` leptonic models '' , where a relativistic electron - positron jet plasma up - scatters low energy photons to high energies via the inverse compton effect .",
    "the emission region moves with relativistic velocities along the jet , and the resulting radiation is highly beamed into the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "the target photon field could come either from the accretion disk surrounding the putative black hole ( e.g.@xcite ) , possibly partly reprocessed by broad - line region ( blr ) clouds ( e.g.@xcite ) or a dusty torus ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , or it could be produced by the relativistic @xmath7 population itself , in so - called synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) models @xcite .",
    "in such leptonic models , it seems plausible to assume that ssc radiation dominates in objects with relatively weak accretion disk radiation such as bl  lac objects , while in fsrqs external photons provide the dominant target field for the inverse compton process .    as an alternative to leptonic models ,",
    "`` hadronic models '' were proposed more than 10 years ago to explain the @xmath6-ray emission from blazars  @xcite .",
    "recently mcke & protheroe @xcite have discussed in detail the various contributing emission processes . in hadronic models",
    "the relativistic jet consists of relativistic proton and electron components , which again move relativistically along the jet .",
    "high - energy radiation is produced through photomeson production , and through proton and muon synchrotron radiation , and subsequent synchrotron - pair cascading in the highly magnetized environment .",
    "again either external ( i.e. from an accretion disk and/or ir - torus @xcite ) or internal photon fields ( i.e. produced by synchrotron radiation from the co - accelerated electrons ) can serve as the target for photopion production .",
    "gamma - ray loud bl lac objects are most likely explained by the latter possibility .",
    "these models can , in principle , be distinguished from the leptonic models by the observation of high energy neutrinos generated in decay chains of mesons created in the photoproduction interactions ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .    in this paper , we study the properties of the synchrotron proton blazar ( spb ) model @xcite , where the dominant target photon field is produced by directly accelerated electrons that manifests itself in the blazar sed as the synchrotron hump .",
    "a detailed description of the model itself and its implementation as a monte - carlo / numerical code has already been given in @xcite .",
    "since this model is for objects with a negligible external component of the radiation field in the jet , we apply it only to bl  lac objects .",
    "it has been successfully demonstrated that this model reproduces well the observed double - humped blazar sed .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive study of the model s parameter space , a promising tool for discriminating between leptonic models and the hadronic spb - model .",
    "we apply our model to both lbls and hbls , and discuss our results in the light of the suggested lbl / hbl continuity .    in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of the spb model .",
    "the model is applied to hbls and lbls to calculate the seds in section 3 .",
    "we vary the magnetic field strength and the target photon density and study their effect on the resulting cascade spectrum .",
    "these results are used to identify the parameter sets within the spb - model which are typical for hbls and lbls in sect . 3.2 . in sect .",
    "3.3 we compare the model predictions to observed seds from hbls and lbls .",
    "one of the most dramatic properties of blazars is their variability , and this issue is addressed by modeling the evolution of the seds during outburst and quiescent stages in sect .",
    "the predicted neutrino emission from these sources is calculated in section 4 .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in sect .",
    "we consider an emission region , or `` blob '' , in an agn jet which moves relativistically along the jet axis which is closely aligned with our line - of - sight .",
    "the model assumes that electrons ( @xmath8 ) and protons ( @xmath9 ) are co - accelerated at the same site in the jet .",
    "due to pitch - angle scattering the resulting particle distributions are expected to be quasi - isotropic .",
    "the energetic protons , which follow a power law energy spectrum , are injected instantaneously into a highly magnetized environment , and suffer from energy losses due to proton  photon interactions ( meson production and bethe - heitler pair production ) , synchrotron radiation and adiabatic expansion .",
    "the mesons produced in photomeson interactions always decay in astrophysical environments . for the magnetic fields and proton energies typically assumed in hadronic blazar models",
    ", however , secondary particles such as mesons and muons may suffer synchrotron losses before they decay @xcite , and this is also taken into account .",
    "the relativistic co - accelerated @xmath8 radiate synchrotron photons that serve as the target radiation field for proton - photon interactions and the pair - synchrotron cascade which subsequently develops .",
    "this cascade redistributes the photon power to lower energies where the photons eventually escape from the emission region .",
    "the cascades can be initiated by photons from @xmath10-decay ( `` @xmath10 cascade '' ) , electrons from the @xmath11 decay ( `` @xmath12 cascade '' ) , @xmath9-synchrotron photons ( `` @xmath9-synchrotron cascade '' ) , charged @xmath13- , @xmath14- @xcite and @xmath15-synchrotron photons ( `` @xmath16-synchrotron cascade '' ) and @xmath7 from the proton - photon bethe - heitler pair production ( `` bethe - heitler cascade '' ) .",
    "the probability of pair production is calculated from the @xmath17 pair production opacity .",
    "the @xmath18-pairs generated radiate synchrotron photons , which again suffer from pair production , and feed the cascade development .",
    "we use the matrix method ( e.g. @xcite ) for simulating the developing cascades .",
    "our model utilizes exact cross sections pre - calculated using the monte - carlo technique .",
    "this is especially important for the hadronic particle production .",
    "the photomeson production is simulated with the sophia monte - carlo code @xcite .",
    "details of the model implementation , e.g. energy loss rates , cascading method , etc . , are described in @xcite .",
    "the `` @xmath10 cascades '' and `` @xmath12 cascades '' generate rather featureless photon spectra in contrast to `` @xmath9-synchrotron cascades '' and `` @xmath16-synchrotron cascades '' that produce a double - humped sed as typically observed for @xmath6-ray blazars .",
    "we find the contribution from bethe - heitler pair production to be negligible .",
    "direct proton and muon synchrotron radiation is mainly responsible for the high energy hump whereas the low energy hump is dominated by synchrotron radiation by the directly accelerated @xmath19 , with a contribution of synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons ( produced by the @xmath9- and @xmath16-synchrotron cascade ) .    in the present paper , we have made three changes to the original model .",
    "the first change addresses @xmath18 pair production in photon - photon collisions . due to energy and momentum conservation , one of the produced pair electrons ( with energy @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath21 ) carries most of the available energy .",
    "we take this into account by using @xmath22 , whereas the original model assumed that @xmath23 .",
    "test runs show that the effect of this improvement on the cascade development is very modest .",
    "the second change in the model concerns the particle acceleration time scale . in the most general form",
    "it can be written as @xmath24 for almost all proposed particle acceleration scenarios , with @xmath25 being the acceleration efficiency which is strongly model dependent and , in most cases , even not well defined .",
    "hence , instead of specifying @xmath26 , and thereby limiting ourselves to one specific scenario , we use eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and leave @xmath26 as a free parameter .",
    "the efficiency , @xmath26 , essentially influences the cutoff energy of the accelerated particle spectrum which is obtained by balancing the loss and gain time scales .",
    "the particle spectrum is assumed to follow a heaviside function at the cutoff energy .",
    "the third change concerns the treatment of the size of the emission region @xmath27 . in this paper",
    "we use @xmath27 as a free parameter , independent of the variability time scale . the justification for this",
    "is given in @xcite which discuss the relation between the emission region geometry and the observed variability time .",
    "note that in blazar models where protons are picked up from the ambient medium by a relativistic blast wave , the so - called `` pick - up models '' @xcite , the variability time scale is determined by density inhomogeneities in the ambient medium rather by the size of the emission region .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is relevant for the @xmath17 pair production opacity , @xmath28 interaction rate , @xmath29 opacity , adiabatic losses due to jet expansion ( see appendix a ) and the normalization of the emitted cascade spectrum .    because of the high energy threshold for photoproduction , hadronic models require extremely high proton energies which can only be achieved in a highly magnetized environment , and so synchrotron losses become very severe .",
    "magnetic field values of order @xmath30  g are expected near the horizon of a supermassive black hole with mass @xmath31@xcite .",
    "assuming magnetic flux conservation , jet magnetic fields may reach values of 1 - 100 g in an emission region @xmath32 au away from the black hole horizon .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the injected and accelerated particle spectrum can be represented as a power - law spectrum @xmath33 , @xmath34 and we use @xmath35 and @xmath36 unless noted otherwise . in the following all quantities in the jet frame are indicated by a prime , while quantities in the observer s frame are unprimed .",
    "gamma - ray loud bl  lac objects are commonly classified as hbls or lbls on the basis of their ratio of radio to x - ray flux i.e. hbls have a broad - band spectral index @xmath37 and lbls have @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "consequently , for the lbl sub - class , the synchrotron peak is generally observed at ir / optical / uv - frequencies , while the x - ray band covers the local minimum of the sed @xmath39 between the two spectral humps .",
    "lbls were thought to represent an intermediate object class between fsrqs , which have much higher bolometric luminosities , and hbls , which are the least luminous blazers . in fsrqs",
    "@xmath39 peaks in the ir / optical / uv and at mev - gev - energies , while in hbls @xmath39 peaks at soft to medium - energy x - rays and gev - tev energies .",
    "the apparent strict bimodality in the bl lac distribution seems , however , now to be replaced by a more continuous scenario .",
    "new surveys such as dxrbs @xcite , rgb  @xcite and rex  @xcite , which cover previously unexplored regions in the parameter space , show a smoother distribution of peak frequencies , suggesting that the two classes of objects are not intrinsically different , but result from one or a few parameters varying within the _ same _ source population .    in order to identify the critical parameter(s ) in the framework of the spb - model we have constructed the `` average '' synchrotron spectrum for each class , hbls and lbls , which serve as the target photon distribution for our cascade model .",
    "for this undertaking we use the `` average '' of an extensive collection of blazar seds published by ghisellini et al . @xcite . by overlaying all available hbl and lbl seds",
    "we find that the following broken power law gives a reasonable representation of the low - frequency hump in the sed of hbls and lbls @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43ev .",
    "the break may be considered as a result of emission by an electron spectrum that is dominated by expansion losses below the break energy , and by synchrotron losses above ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the parametrizations for each object class are visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : hbl_lbl_sed ] .",
    "we find that the break energy @xmath44 of lbls varies up to about one order of magnitude , from @xmath45 0.1 ev to 1.3 ev , while the maximum synchrotron photon energy @xmath46 can cover a range up to two orders of magnitude , from @xmath47 41 ev to 4 kev .",
    "the populated energy range of hbls is more restricted : @xmath48 26 ev to 131 ev and @xmath49 4.1 kev to 41 kev .",
    "the peak of the low - energy sed is @xmath50 for lbls and @xmath51 for hbls .",
    "we define the `` standard lbl '' by @xmath521.3 ev , @xmath534.1 kev and @xmath54 , and the `` standard hbl '' by @xmath52131 ev , @xmath5341 kev and @xmath55 . in the following parameter study , we use these `` definitions '' , and vary the magnetic field strength and target photon density as the most interesting parameters .      in this section",
    "we explore the effects of varying different model parameters on the blazar sed , especially its high - energy part .",
    "the magnetic field is a key parameter in hadronic models . in order to accelerate protons to energies above the photopion production threshold , fields of order 10 g are necessary",
    "[ fig : standard_sed ] shows the resulting sed for `` standard '' hbl and lbl target photon spectra in a 10 , 30 and 50 g field .",
    "if hbls possess intrinsically low photon fields , proton synchrotron radiation always dominates over pion production .",
    "the resulting cascade spectrum ( fig .  [ fig : standard_sed]a ) consists mainly of proton synchrotron emission at gamma - ray energies , and reprocessed proton synchrotron radiation ( i.e. synchrotron radiation from the pair produced @xmath7 ) at x - ray energies for @xmath56  g.    in the denser ( lbl - like ; see sect .",
    "3.2.2 ) photon fields one can observe the growing importance of synchrotron losses with increasing magnetic field strength .",
    "synchrotron radiation generates two distinct humps : one at high energy mainly due to the emerging @xmath13 synchrotron radiation , and one at low energy dominated by synchrotron radiation of the secondary electrons from the @xmath13 synchrotron cascade .",
    "the radiation from the @xmath10 and @xmath57-cascades adds to the emission from the @xmath9 and @xmath13 synchrotron cascades , and so may fill in the gap between the two humps , especially for low magnetic fields . for field values below 10  g , the featureless @xmath10 and @xmath57-cascades may even dominate the emerging cascade spectrum .",
    "this highlights the need of high field values in blazars in the framework of the present model .",
    "muon synchrotron radiation , and its subsequent generation(s ) , peaks at higher energies than the corresponding @xmath9 synchrotron radiation  @xcite .",
    "aharonian @xcite has argued that a significant flux of tev - photons requires an optically thin emission region at these energies , thus a low target photon density and consequently a low efficiency of photopion production . in tev blazars , all of which are hbls",
    ", we therefore expect the contribution from the @xmath13 synchrotron cascade to be smaller than that from the @xmath9 synchrotron cascade .",
    "( note , however , that the spectral data may be also explainable by models with a moderately optically thick photospheric emission in the tev - regime @xcite which would allow a higher photohadronic interaction rate and observable emission of @xmath10 and @xmath13-induced cascades also in tev - blazars @xcite . )",
    "however , it seems to be the opposite in lbls . here , for field values up to at least 50 g the @xmath13 synchrotron cascade determines the 2-peak structure in our chosen `` standard '' lbl , while a non - negligible contribution from the @xmath14-cascades fills the gap between the humps in the sed , smoothing out the bumpy spectral shape .",
    "we find that with increasing magnetic field , the two - humped structure becomes more and more pronounced due to the growing @xmath13 and @xmath9 synchrotron photon production , and the luminosity increases partly because we have assumed that the relativistic proton energy density increases in equipartition with magnetic field energy density .    the ratio between the low to high energy peak of the cascade spectrum is mainly determined by opacity effects , and is in general lower in the denser lbl - like target photon fields than in the less dense hbl - like environments , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : standard_sed ] .",
    "the maximum photon energy in the high - energy hump is proportional to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the maximum proton lorentz factor , which in turn is determined by balancing the acceleration time scale with the energy loss scale , and @xmath60 is the doppler factor . in hbls",
    "this particle cutoff is caused by @xmath9 synchrotron losses for strong fields , and adiabatic losses for fields @xmath61 10 g. in the denser target photon fields of lbls the cutoff occurs at significantly lower energies , and is caused by losses through photopion production , independently of magnetic field strength .",
    "so far , there is no convincing evidence for significantly different doppler factors and emission volumes in hbls and lbls . as a consequence ,",
    "the more luminous lbls probably possess larger co - moving frame electron synchrotron photon densities than hbls . in this section",
    "we study the effect of varying the target photon density on the high - energy hump of the sed in the spb - model .",
    "[ fig : emerging_cascade]a shows the cascade spectrum in a hbl - like target photon distribution with varying low - energy target photon density indicated in the figure as the broken power law curves at the left .",
    "the size of the emission region @xmath27 , doppler factor @xmath60 and magnetic field @xmath62 are held fixed at @xmath63 , @xmath64 cm and @xmath65 g. for these fixed parameters , @xmath66@xmath67 ev @xmath68 covers the full range of observed @xmath39 in hbls as described in sect .  3.1 , and we shall describe the effect of varying @xmath69 in this range . as mentioned previously , the contribution of @xmath13-synchrotron and @xmath14-cascades increases with increasing @xmath69 because of the growing efficiency of photo - meson production .",
    "this affects not only the shape of the cascade spectrum , but also the proton cutoff energy .",
    "specifically , in fig .",
    "[ fig : emerging_cascade]a the proton spectrum cuts off due proton synchrotron losses for @xmath70 ev @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding cascade spectra are mainly determined by the @xmath9 synchrotron cascade . for higher @xmath69 a significant contribution from the @xmath13-cascade emission",
    "modifies the spectral shape .",
    "the apparent increase of the `` dip '' energy ( i.e. , the energy corresponding to the minimum between the low and high energy humps of the _ cascade _ spectrum ) with increasing @xmath69 above 10@xmath71 ev @xmath68 is caused by an increase in the reprocessed @xmath13 synchrotron component . because opacity effects also gain importance for higher photon densities , the ratio of the low to high energy peaks of the cascade sed increases with increasing @xmath69 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the soft photon and high energy peak luminosities are approximately equal for target densities",
    "@xmath72 ev @xmath68 , and their ratio increases with increasing target photon density .",
    "keeping @xmath27 , @xmath60 and @xmath62 fixed as before , and increasing the target photon density even more , one enters the range for lbl - like blazars : @xmath73@xmath74 ev @xmath75 would correspond to @xmath76@xmath77 erg / s .",
    "the predicted lbl cascade spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emerging_cascade]b .",
    "clearly visible is the decrease of the high - energy cutoff with growing @xmath69 . here , energy gains from acceleration are balanced by photoproduction losses in all cases . because of the dense target photon fields , photo - meson production determines not only the cutoff energy but also the spectral shape .",
    "opacity effects are responsible for the steady decline of the high energy hump with increasing @xmath69 as more and more energy is redistributed from high to low energies . the dip energy , and corresponding dip luminosity ,",
    "then become increasingly difficult to define . the reprocessed @xmath13 synchrotron radiation , which initially dominates the low energy hump of the cascade spectrum , is gradually replaced by the featureless @xmath14-cascade emission for @xmath78ev @xmath68 which fills the gap between the low and high - energy cascade humps .",
    "the @xmath14 cascade dominates the emission between 1  mev and 100  mev for @xmath79ev @xmath68 , and between 10  kev and 100  mev for @xmath80ev @xmath68 in lbl - like target spectra . for denser target",
    "photon fields the @xmath14 cascades completely determine the whole cascade spectrum , and proton synchrotron radiation would be unimportant .    to summarize , in the low target photon densities of hbl - like objects @xmath9 synchrotron radiation and its reprocessed emission dominates . in the very dense target photon environments of lbl - like sources",
    "photo - meson production becomes so efficient that first @xmath13 synchrotron cascade radiation , and finally @xmath14-cascade radiation determines the entire cascade sed .",
    "the radiative efficiency of photopion production is much lower than @xmath9 synchrotron radiation , and this becomes apparent when comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : emerging_cascade]a and [ fig : emerging_cascade]b .",
    "seds dominated by @xmath9 synchrotron radiation show in their high - frequency humps power comparable to or higher than the seed photon density ( mainly generated by synchrotron emission from primary electrons )",
    ". however , when photoproduction is the dominant process , the emerging cascade spectra are significantly below the low energy hump caused by the directly accelerated electrons .",
    "thus , if lbl - like objects have high density target photon fields @xmath81 ev @xmath68 , then they would be @xmath6-ray quiet unless one of the other parameters ( e.g. @xmath60 , @xmath27 , @xmath62 ) changed in a way to increase the high - frequency hump .",
    "indeed , this could explain why many radio - loud blazars have never been observed in @xmath6-rays .",
    "intrinsic tev - emission from lbls could also be suppressed if the particle acceleration efficiency @xmath26 is significantly lower than for hbls .",
    "the effects of varying the size of the emission region @xmath27 and/or",
    "@xmath60 for a given magnetic field and target photon density are obvious : an increase in @xmath27 and/or @xmath60 would result in a significant increase in the emerging luminosity , and the maximum photon energy would increase with increasing doppler factor .",
    "furthermore , since the photon - photon pair production opacity @xmath82 grows with the size of the emission region , it will cause effects similar to increasing @xmath83 without , however , any change of the @xmath28 interaction rate .",
    "an interesting case is when proton synchrotron and photoproduction losses are approximately equal above the pion production threshold .",
    "this occurs , e.g. , at target photon densities",
    "@xmath84 ev @xmath68 for a 30  g magnetic field ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : u_11]a ) .",
    "because the break energy in the low energy synchrotron component ( used as target for @xmath28 interactions in our model ) is low in lbls , the pion production loss time follows roughly a @xmath85 dependence up to @xmath86 , and is at roughly the same level as the proton synchrotron loss time @xmath87 from low to high proton energies .",
    "this leads for the given parameters to approximately equal pion production and proton synchrotron losses at high energies in lbl . the rather dense target photon field , together with a strong magnetic field , are ideal conditions for muon synchrotron radiation .",
    "consequently , in lbls with @xmath88  g and @xmath84 ev @xmath68 , the high energy hump is mainly due to proton and muon synchrotron radiation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : u_11]a ) .",
    "in contrast , hbls have much higher break energies in their low energy synchrotron component , with the consequence that proton synchrotron losses dominate over pion production losses , leading to a high - frequency hump which is predominantly due to proton synchrotron radiation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : u_11]b ) .      in this section",
    "we propose that hbls and lbls are intrinsically the same objects but with different low energy photon densities @xmath89 .",
    "the photon density may range continuously from low ( hbls ) to high ( lbls ) values , resulting in a continuous range of seds in the low energy hump , consistent with the apparent strict bimodality in the bl lac distribution being now replaced by a more continuous scenario as suggested following recent data from dxrbs @xcite , rgb  @xcite and rex  @xcite . because for each parameter set in the spb model there exists a @xmath89 above which @xmath28 interactions dominate , and below which proton synchrotron losses dominate , this results in a dichotomy when the high energy hump is included in the sed .",

    "@xmath91ev @xmath68 , the probability for @xmath9 synchrotron photons to produce @xmath7 pairs is negligible , and thus reprocessed proton synchrotron radiation does not appear .",
    "bethe - heitler pair production and pion photoproduction are also unimportant , as is the @xmath13 synchrotron cascade . because of the low target photon density in the emitting volume , photons up to several tev can escape the emission region .",
    "[ fig : extremelbl ] shows an example corresponding to an extreme lbl , i.e. , at the other end of the bl lac distribution .",
    "losses due to photo - meson production cut the proton injection spectrum off at @xmath92 ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : extremelbl]b ) . with @xmath9 synchrotron radiation being rather unimportant in this environment ,",
    "the cascades initiated by photo - pion production completely dominate the sed , and produce a rather featureless spectrum , where the dip between the low- and high energy cascade component has completely disappeared .    to demonstrate the lbl / hbl dichotomy we shall discuss the observed seds of a typical hbl ( mkn  421 ) and a typical lbl ( pks  0716 + 714 ) within the framework of our spb model .",

    "variability in the present model could be caused by an increase in the accretion rate causing a shock to propagate along the jet .",
    "pre - existing density enhancements or `` blobs '' could thereby be re - energized , and may undergo an increase in their bulk lorentz factor .    to demonstrate how this could work in hbls , we have chosen the @xmath6-ray loud bl lac object mkn  501 where the different stages of activity seem to be sampled best @xcite .",
    "[ fig : mrk501flare ] shows our modeling of the three main activity states ( historical , 7 april 1997 and 16 april 1997 ) leading to the giant 1997-flare .",
    "mkn  501 is an hbl , and so the dominant @xmath6-ray production mechanism in our spb model should be proton synchrotron emission",
    ". this would be the case even for the quiet state , although we note that the high - energy component in this state is not very well constrained , and other parameter choices can easily be found to fit the data equally well .",
    "future data from more sensitive instruments , e.g. glast @xcite , may provide better constraints .",
    "for each of the three states , we show the target photon spectrum ( solid curves ) we use for pion photoproduction , and cascading .",
    "as the shock moves through the highly magnetized plasma , electrons start to increase their synchrotron photon production , possibly due to an increase in the number of relativistic electrons .",
    "this leads to a higher _ intrinsic _ ( i.e. jet - frame ) photon density , and thus to an increase of the observed synchrotron hump , from @xmath102 erg / s for the mkn  501 1997-outburst .",
    "simultaneously , the number of relativistic protons also increases .",
    "the appearance of a `` fresh '' relativistic shock in an otherwise weakly turbulent plasma implies qualitatively an increase of the acceleration efficiency @xmath26 . in our model",
    "we increased @xmath26 from @xmath103 to @xmath36 during flaring , and this naturally leads to a higher and correlated cutoff energy of both electron and proton particle spectra , and consequently to a _ correlated _ shift of synchrotron peak energy and @xmath6-ray peak energy to higher energies .",
    "we also note that the observed break in the electron synchrotron spectrum becomes less pronounced with flaring activity , as is expected when the energy loss time scale becomes comparable to the dynamical ( i.e.  light - crossing ) time scale for a particle injection spectrum steeper than @xmath104 @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "however , we have used a broken power law spectrum with the same break ( i.e.  @xmath41 , @xmath105 ) for all three activity stages to represent the target photon spectrum for our spb - model .",
    "the target photon spectrum break and cutoff energies used were @xmath106  ev and @xmath107  kev for the quiescent state , @xmath108  kev and @xmath109  kev for the intermediate state , and @xmath110  kev and @xmath111  kev for the flaring state .    due to the higher acceleration efficiency , the cutoff energy in the injected proton spectrum , determined by synchrotron losses , increases by about a factor of 5 in our example .",
    "although the jet frame target photon density increases nearly a factor of five from the quiescent stage to the flare stage , photo - meson production , and thus @xmath13 synchrotron emission as proposed in @xcite to explain the mkn  501 flare , remains still of minor importance .    the combined effect of increasing proton cutoff energy , and increasing doppler factor , causes an increase of the `` dip '' energy in the blazar sed .",
    "this behaviour is also expected for leptonic ssc models ( see @xcite ) , as a result of the increasing synchrotron and compton peak energy and the flattening of the underlying electron spectrum .",
    "the magnetic field and the jet frame emission volume remain approximately constant during an outburst .",
    "thus the apparent luminosity rise during an outburst is mainly caused by an increase of beaming . because protons are co - accelerated with the electrons , our model predicts correlated variability of the synchrotron and high - energy sed component , with a possible lag of the high - energy hump caused by the longer acceleration and energy loss time scale of the protons in comparison to the electrons .",
    "in contrast to leptonic models , in hadronic models @xmath6-ray production by pion photoproduction would result in simultaneous neutrino production .",
    "the main neutrino production channel is through the decay of charged pions , e.g. @xmath112 followed by @xmath113 .",
    "the neutrinos escape without further interaction .",
    "[ fig : neutrino ] shows the predicted average neutrino emission from mkn  421 and pks  0716 + 714 .",
    "the photon - hadron interactions for both , lbls and hbls , take place predominantly in the resonance region . here , @xmath114 and",
    "thus @xmath115 production is suppressed .",
    "we give the predicted neutrino emission from the objects themselves , and do not consider here any additional contribution from escaping cosmic rays interacting while propagating through the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "provided mkn  421 and pks  0716 + 714 are typical for their respective object class , and that the doppler factor in mkn  421 is comparable or higher than in pks  0716 + 714 , we find a clear dominance of neutrino emission from lbls in comparison to hbls .",
    "the reason for this is the higher meson production rate in the lbl source population due to their higher target photon fields in comparison to the hbl population where proton synchrotron losses dominate .",
    "thus more power , in our modeling for mkn  421 by a factor of @xmath116@xmath117 , is channeled into the photon component in hbls , while in lbls the power output of photons and neutrinos is approximately equal .",
    "this is in contrast to previous hadronic jet models which predict equal photon and neutrino energy fluxes for all blazar types ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the neutrino production spectrum depends on the ambient proton spectrum and the spectrum and density of target photons .",
    "the proton injection spectrum is modified by interactions and energy losses .",
    "for mkn  421 the photopion production rate approximately follows a broken power law , @xmath118 for proton energies below @xmath119  gev , and @xmath120 above @xmath121  gev due to the break in the target photon spectrum ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this leads to a break in the neutrino spectrum at @xmath119  gev ( observer frame ) , from power spectral index @xmath122 to @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "a further low energy break in the neutrino spectrum at @xmath125 gev is caused by the change of photopion production rate at threshold .",
    "the high - energy cutoff at @xmath126 gev in the observer s frame , caused by @xmath16-synchrotron losses ( @xmath12-synchrotron emission is unimportant ) , is below the strict upper limit of @xmath127 gev predicted by @xcite .",
    "another important source of high energy neutrinos is the production and decay of charged kaons when the proton - photon interaction takes place predominantly in the secondary resonance region of the cross section @xcite",
    ". this might be the case for hbls because their target photon field can extend up to x - ray energies .",
    "positively charged kaons decay with @xmath128 probability into muons and direct high energy muon - neutrinos .",
    "these muon - neutrinos will not have energies reduced as a result of synchrotron radiation by their parent particles . unlike the neutrinos originating from @xmath12 and @xmath16-decay , they will dominate the neutrino flavors at the high energy end of the emerging neutrino spectrum ( @xmath129  gev ) , and also cause the total neutrino spectrum to extend to @xmath130  gev .",
    "we expect the neutrino emission from pks  0716 + 714 to be cut off at @xmath131 gev ( observer frame ) for all neutrino flavors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrino ] ) due to a roughly one order of magnitude lower proton cutoff .",
    "also @xmath16 synchrotron losses may play a role here , and are expected to cut off at the same neutrino energy of @xmath131 gev .",
    "the neutrino spectrum follows a power law with index @xmath122 below the cutoff , and is caused by photohadronic interactions with the target photon field above @xmath132 . because of the @xmath14-production threshold and the relatively low proton cutoff in lbls , meson production in the photon field below @xmath132 can not occur .",
    "in addition to the neutrinos from the meson decay chain , there will be a small contribution of @xmath133 from neutron decay ( not shown in the figures ) . for @xmath27 of 10@xmath134 to 10@xmath135 cm",
    "only neutrons of energy 30 to 3000 gev will decay inside the production region .",
    "high - energy neutrons leaving the source into the observer s sight line will decay and produce highly beamed neutrinos , which also makes them appearing to come from the agn .",
    "in addition , there will be also a contribution from neutrons decaying close enough to the system to appear a point source to the observer .",
    "the @xmath136 flux from neutron decay at about 1 tev will be approximately the same as the @xmath137 flux at that energy .",
    "neutrons produced during pion photoproduction interactions of protons may escape from the emission region if the optical depth for neutron - photon inetractions , @xmath138 , is less than one . in this optically thin case ,",
    "the escaping neutrons may decay outside the agn to become cosmic rays . since the output of cosmic rays",
    "would then be related to the neutrino output , the observed cosmic ray intensity can be used to set an upper bound on the extragalactic neutrino background ( enb ) due to neutrino emission by optically thin photoproduction sources @xcite . if , on the other hand , the source is optically thick to neutron - photon interactions the upper bound on the enb intensity @xcite is obtained instead from the observed diffuse gamma - ray background .",
    "we can determine which bound , optically thick or optically thin , should apply to lbls and hbls by considering the relevant time scales .",
    "the neutron - photon optical depth is @xmath139 .",
    "note that since @xmath140 ( appendix a ) and that to a reasonable approximation @xmath141 , we have @xmath142 . from figs .",
    "4a , 5a and 6a we see that for hbls @xmath143 , and that for lbls @xmath144 .",
    "thus the optically thin bound should apply for hbls and the optically thick bound for lbls .      from fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrino ] we expect that the contribution from lbls to the diffuse extragalactic neutrino background ( enb ) would dominate unless hbls turn out to be significantly more numerous than lbls .",
    "there are several methods to estimate the diffuse neutrino background .",
    "one method which has been suggested in @xcite is to normalize to the observed extragalactic diffuse @xmath6-ray background @xcite .",
    "if lbls dominate the blazar contribution of @xmath145 @xcite to the extragalactic @xmath6-ray background at gev energies , then we would expect a diffuse integrated neutrino intensity of @xmath146 gev @xmath147 s@xmath148 sr@xmath148 .",
    "however , hbls may dominate the tev - photon background , and by extrapolating the observed photon background to tev - energies and normalizing the neutrino output from hbls to the tev - background , we would find a diffuse flux from hbls of about 34 orders of magnitude lower . taking this into account ,",
    "the predicted enb intensity from hbls lies several orders of magnitude below the neutrino upper bounds @xcite .",
    "if the lbl and hbl luminosity function is known , the diffuse neutrino background is readily derived by convolving this luminosity function with the neutrino output of each source and integrating over redshift : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the co - moving cosmological volume , @xmath151 is the redshift , @xmath152 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath153 is the source differential luminosity function at peak luminosity , @xmath154 of the low energy hump of the sed .",

    "our estimated diffuse neutrino flux depends strongly on the @xmath182-ratio , which in turn is rather uncertain . to show this",

    "the discussion above shows that there is a large uncertainty in our predicted diffuse neutrino flux , with @xmath185 orders of magnitude alone due to the uncertainty in the @xmath186 ratio , in addition to the uncertain bl  lac luminosity function and its lbl fraction .",
    "we have presented a parameter study of the spb model proposed recently to explain the observed spectral energy distribution of @xmath6-ray loud bl lac objects , i.e.  hbls and lbls .",
    "this model needs strong magnetic fields together with proton , muon and pion synchrotron radiation in order to produce the double - humped structure observed during active phases of @xmath6-ray emission , and this is the main difference to the original hadronic `` proton initiated cascade '' ( pic ) model @xcite which resulted in a rather featureless @xmath187-cascade spectrum .",
    "if lbls possess denser jet frame synchrotron photon fields than hbls , i.e.  denser target photon fields for @xmath28 interactions and cascading in our model , then we have shown that the high - energy emission in these two types of objects is of different origin . while the mev - tev radiation from hbls is dominated by proton synchrotron radiation , in lbls",
    "there is a significant contribution from muon synchrotron radiation at gev - tev energies in addition to the proton synchrotron radiation which dominates at mev - energies .",
    "this is caused by the significantly higher pion ( and muon ) production rate .",
    "consequently the injected proton spectrum is cut off due to pion production losses in lbl - like objects , while in hbl - like objects proton synchrotron radiation is responsible for the cut off in the proton spectrum .",
    "these cutoffs directly translate into the observed high energy photon cutoff at the source if the doppler factor is known .",
    "a further consequence of different intrinsic target photon fields in hbls and lbls is a difference in the ratio of the luminosity in the high energy hump to low energy hump in their cascade spectra ( due to proton acceleration ) . because opacity effects decisively influence this ratio , the cascade spectra of lbls have in general smaller ratios than that of hbls .",
    "also , the high energy peak to `` dip '' luminosity appears to be smaller in the denser lbl - like environments than in hbls .",
    "this is a consequence of the higher pion production rate in lbls in comparison to hbls which causes the featureless @xmath14-cascade to become important and fill in the gap between the two humps with proton and muon radiation .    to demonstrate the difference between lbls and hbls in the spb - model",
    "we have fitted the average observed sed of pks  0716 + 714 and mkn  421 . in doing so , we found that hbls need acceleration efficiencies of order unity to give high energy hump energies in the tev - range , whereas for lbls acceleration efficiencies of @xmath188 seem to account for the observations .",
    "lbls may also produce multi - tev photons at a lower level than hbls despite their higher bolometric luminosity .",
    "the production mechanism is through muon synchrotron radiation that peaks at a higher energy than the synchrotron radiation of the primary protons .",
    "we therefore suggest that nearby lbls be included in the observing source lists of future high - sensitivity cherenkov - telescopes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gamma - ray loud bl lacs are well - known for their flaring activity , and we have modeled the nearly simultaneous observations of the intermediate and flaring stage of the famous 1997 giant outburst of mkn  501 .",
    "an increase of the doppler factor and acceleration efficiency , together with rising proton and electron density ( leading to a denser intrinsic synchrotron target photon field ) can account for the observations satisfactorily . because the observations were only simultaneous on a one - day time scale",
    "at most we believe that our time - independent code is suitable for this simulation . at this point",
    "we stress the need for time - resolved simultaneous observations to provide further constrains for blazar modeling , which then must be carried out using time - dependent simulation codes .",
    "although proton and muon synchrotron emission , and their reprocessed radiation , produce a double - humped structure in typical blazar jet environments , namely one at x - ray energies , and another at gev - tev energies , the low - energy synchrotron target photon field dominates over the x - ray hump in the cascade spectrum in nearly all cases presented here .",
    "this seems to suggest that the ss - pic model proposed by @xcite , where the observed x - ray hump is due to reprocessed proton and muon synchrotron radiation , is constrained to a rather narrow parameter range , and this is shown in @xcite .",
    "the relatively small doppler factors favoured in @xcite imply thick target photon fields , and consequently significant reprocessing leading to comparable power at x - ray and sub - tev energies but making it difficult to explain the high - energy bump to be at multi - tev energies .",
    "the dominance of proton synchrotron radiation in hbls has recently been used by @xcite to consider a blazar model where all proton synchrotron photons escape the completely optically thin emission region , and appear as the high - energy hump in the blazar sed .",
    "this occurs in intrinsically thin or extremely low energetic ambient photon fields ( i.e. very high doppler factors @xmath96@xmath189 are necessary ) , where @xmath28-interactions and cascading can be neglected , and extremely large magnetic fields of @xmath190  g are necessary to fit the observed sed in this case .",
    "if the x - ray emission is produced by synchrotron emission in the strong magnetic field from secondary electrons which are the result of @xmath17-pair production of the tev synchrotron photons of the primary protons with an ambient external infrared photon field , then the x - ray flare is expected to lag the @xmath6-ray flare .",
    "since acceleration of electrons is faster than of protons , @xmath191 , typically by a few hours for blazars , @xmath6-rays should lag x - rays if the x - rays stem from the primary co - accelerated electrons .",
    "if electrons are accelerated in the same process as the protons , @xmath6-rays from the pic - processes are in competition with photons from the leptonic ssc process .",

    "the addition of cold electrons possibly needed for charge neutrality in hbls if @xmath219 would add little to the estimated jet power .",
    "a caveat in hadronic models is that most processes are rather slow in comparison to leptonic interactions .",

    "this limit is based on @xmath221 and @xmath36 , and assuming that the size of the emission region does not constrain the variability time scale .",
    "for hbls proton synchrotron radiation dominates the loss processes .",
    "hence , the smallest variability time scale ( again provided @xmath27 does not determine @xmath222 ) depends on the doppler factor , magnetic field and @xmath26 , which in turn determines essentially the high energy photon turnover @xmath223 ( in tev ) : @xmath224^{-0.5}$]sec with @xmath225 tev corresponding to @xmath25 .",

    "if lbls possess intrinsically denser target photon fields than hbls , then within the spb model , higher meson production rates are expected in lbls , leading to a higher neutrino production rate .",
    "the diffuse neutrino background will therefore be dominated by lbls , unless hbls turn out to be significantly more numerous than lbls .    to estimate the diffuse neutrino flux",
    "we must know the luminosity functions of hbls and lbls , and the neutrino energy spectrum of hbls and lbls as a function of their luminosity .",
    "because of the uncertainties in the bl lac luminosity function and the conversion from low energy peak to 5 ghz - luminosity , the diffuse neutrino flux can only be predicted within a large uncertainty of more than three orders of magnitude . to reduce this uncertainty , it would be helpful to have a luminosity function for @xmath162 or the bolometric luminosity of the low - energy hump .",
