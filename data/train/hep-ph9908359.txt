    "a phase transition from normal nuclear matter to a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions planned to be carried at the future colliders of rhic and lhc .",
    "if the qgp is formed during the collision , according to the usual scenario , it is thought that a local thermal equilibrium will set in over a typical time scale of 1 fm / c @xcite .",
    "the plasma would then expand hydrodynamically and cool down until it reaches a temperature @xmath0 when the confinement phase transition starts .",
    "however , some recent studies @xcite have suggested that the plasma may attain kinetic equilibrium in a very short time scale of @xmath1 fm / c , but it may not be chemically equilibrated .",
    "earlier theoretical studies @xcite have revealed that a chemically non - equlibrated plasma cools faster than the equilibrated plasma , when the plasma is assumed to be ideal i.e. non dissipative .",
    "but in a realistic scenario the dissipative phenomena , in principle , should play an important role @xcite .",
    "it needs to be mentioned here that the dissipative effects in fluid hydrodynamics can be neglected when the reynold s number ( @xmath2 , l is the dimension of the medium and @xmath3 is the mean free path of the constituents ) is quite large .",
    "however , in nucleus - nucleus collisions , as the dimension of the plasma is not large compared to the mean free path of the partons , dissipative effects are expected to be important during the hydrodynamic expansion of the plasma .",
    "the formalism of dissipative hydrodynamics is , in general , complicated since the form of dissipative corrections depends on the choice of the rest frame @xcite .",
    "the effects of dissipative phenomena in quark gluon plasma have been studied in ref @xcite , where the results were reported for a chemically equilibrated baryon - free plasma .",
    "it was shown that the dissipative effect enhances the entropy production leading to a dynamical path intermediate between idealized isentropic and isoergic ones .",
    "the energy density and temperature of the plasma also decrease at slower rate with the inclusion of dissipative effects .",
    "this would lead to greater yields of direct probes such as photons and dileptons , which are sensitive to the thermal history of the reaction .",
    "however , the hydrodynamic expansion for a viscous quark gluon plasma undergoing chemical equilibration either at zero or at finite baryon density has not been investigated so far .    in this work ,",
    "we study the dissipative effects in quark gluon plasma with an emphasis on the results at finite baryon density .",
    "we derive a set of hydrodynamical equations for the evolution of the energy - momentum tensor and parton densities based on simple scaling laws .",
    "this set of equations has been applied to study the hydrodynamical evolution of the viscous plasma undergoing chemical equilibration .",
    "it is found that due to viscous heating , the temperature evolves slower , whereas the parton fugacities evolve faster than the ideal plasma ( without viscosity ) .",
    "this is contrary to the expectation that chemical equilibration consumes more energy which makes the plasma cool faster .",
    "the present work has been organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we begin with a brief review of the dissipative hydrodynamics and derive a set of hydrodynamical equations using landau definition of rest frame . using this set of equations ,",
    "the chemical equilibration of a viscous baryon - free plasma is studied in section iii . finally , in section iv",
    ", we discuss the results and present the conclusions . in the derivations",
    ", we have used simple scaling law for the dissipative corrections , for which a more formal justification has been given in appendix a using boltzmann equation for the evolution of the parton densities .",
    "the viscosity coefficient is shown to be proportional to @xmath4 which is also consistent with the finite temperature qcd calculations as shown in appendix b.",
    "energy dissipation in a moving fluid occurs due to internal friction ( viscosity ) and heat exchange between different parts ( thermal conduction ) of the fluid . if the mean free path of the constituent particles is comparable to the fluid dimension , the collective quantities like pressure , energy density , number density , velocity etc .",
    "may vary over a distance of mean free path .",
    "this will lead to decay of fluid kinetic energy as heat energy . in nucleus - nucleus collisions , as the dimension of the plasma is not very large compared to the mean free path of the partons , dissipative effects may be quite important @xcite .    in the presence of dissipation",
    ", the energy - momentum tensor @xmath5 and number density @xmath6 can be decomposed into an ideal and a dissipative part @xcite @xmath7+\\tau^{i k},\\ ] ] @xmath8 where @xmath9 , p and n are the energy density , pressure and particle number density and @xmath10 is four - velocity in terms of local fluid velocity @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the dissipative corrections    [ [ section ] ]    the relativistic hydrodynamics is based on the local conservation laws : @xmath14 in the present context @xmath6 represents the baryon four vector and the equation @xmath15=0 signifies the conservation of baryon number . however , if there is no net particle production i.e. chemical equilibration is complete , the above equation is applicable to the individual partons as well .",
    "the form of the dissipative terms @xmath12 and @xmath13 depend on the definition of what constitutes the local rest frame of the fluid .",
    "the four velocity @xmath16 should be defined such a way that in a proper frame of any given fluid element , the energy and the number density are expressible in terms of other thermodynamic quantities by the same formulae as when dissipative processes are not present .",
    "it is also necessary to specify whether @xmath16 is the velocity of energy transport or particle transport .",
    "accordingly , there exists two definitions for the rest frame ; one due to landau and other due to eckart . in landau approach",
    ", @xmath16 is taken as the velocity of the energy transport so that energy three flux @xmath17 vanishes in a comoving frame .",
    "the landau definition requires @xmath18 so that @xmath19 is the energy density and @xmath20 is the number density in the proper frame of the fluid . in the eckart definition , @xmath16 is taken as the velocity of the particle transport and the particle three current , rather than the energy three flux vanishes in the fluid rest frame .",
    "so in the eckart definition of rest frame , the particle four vector can be written as @xmath21 , whereas in the landau definition of rest frame @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the two frames are related by a lorentz transformation with a boost velocity @xmath23 .",
    "it is found that due to ill defined boost velocity @xcite , the energy three flux in the eckart frame , which involves heat conductivity @xmath24 is not well defined as it diverges in the limit of chemical potential @xmath250 . on the otherhand ,",
    "in the landau definition heat conduction enters as a correction to baryon flux .",
    "it was shown that inspite of the divergence of @xmath24 , the correction to the baryon flux @xmath13 is finite @xcite .",
    "we use the landau definition for the subsequent study of the evolution of the energy momentum tensor and parton densities of the quark gluon plasma .    under the assumption that the dissipative terms @xmath12 and @xmath13 are of first order in the gradients , the requirement that the entropy increases with time ( @xmath26 ,  @xmath27 with chemical potential @xmath28 and temperature t ) leads to ( in the landau definition ) @xcite @xmath29 @xmath30 ^ 2 \\nabla^\\alpha\\left[\\frac{\\mu}{t}\\right].\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the co - efficients of the shear and bulk viscosities and @xmath24 is the co - efficient of heat conduction . as mentioned before , the heat conductivity does not enter in the energy flux @xmath17 , but rather as a finite baryon current @xmath35 in the rest frame of the fluid . in the presence of dissipation ,",
    "the conservation equations ( 3 ) need to be solved with the above correction terms .",
    "using one - dimensional boost - invariant scaling law @xcite and eq .",
    "( 4 ) for @xmath12 the identity @xmath36=0 , resulting from the energy momentum conservation , takes the simple form @xcite @xmath37 the evaluation of @xmath38 is not straightforward as one needs to know the space time dependence of @xmath39 and also care has to be taken so that @xmath13 is finite although @xmath24 diverges in the limit @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "however , we will follow a simple procedure to obtain the evolution of the baryon density directly without invoking the baryon current ( hence the conductivity ) as given by eq .",
    "it may be mentioned here that in addition to the baryon number conservation , the parton densities ( quark , anti - quark and gluon ) also evolve satisfying the relation @xmath38 in absence of any particle production .",
    "clearly , the evolution of the parton densities will also get modified due to the dissipative corrections .",
    "we estimate these dissipative corrections in a simple way from the following considerations .",
    "since the shear viscosity scales as @xmath41 , while the bulk viscosity @xmath34 vanishes for a quark gluon plasma , one can define an acceptable range for the shear viscosity @xmath33 given by @xcite : @xmath42 so that navier - stokes scaling theory is applicable to the expansion of the plasma . a baryon - free non - viscous plasma ( @xmath28=0 , @xmath33=0 ) leads to @xmath43=@xmath44 .",
    "using the upper bound of viscosity as @xmath33=@xmath45 and substituting @xmath46 in eq.(6 ) , we get @xmath47=@xmath48 .",
    "this means that t scales as @xmath49 for @xmath50 and as @xmath51 for @xmath33 approaching the upper bound .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that t scales as @xmath52 for any value of @xmath33 in the range @xmath53 . since @xmath9 scales as @xmath54 , the lhs of eq.(6 ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath55 as , + = ( 1 - 3 ) . on similar grounds , the evolution of parton density @xmath56 ( i = q , @xmath57 , g )",
    "can be described in one dimension as ( since @xmath56 scales as @xmath58 ) ,    @xmath59    for an ideal plasma , @xmath60 and the rhs of eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) vanish , while for other values of @xmath55 the rhs is non - zero which can be interpreted as the correction due to dissipation . comparing rhs of eq.(8 ) with eq.(6 ) , we can identify @xmath61 it is also interesting to note that @xmath62 for @xmath63 is consistent with the upper limit of viscosity . in terms of @xmath33 , eq .",
    "( 9 ) can be written as @xmath64 the dissipative correction appearing in eq .",
    "( 10 ) is derived for a baryon - free plasma . however , as shown in appendix a , the above correction is also valid for @xmath65 if @xmath9 and @xmath66 are defined appropriately for a baryon - rich plasma .",
    "finally , the evolution of baryon density can be obtained from eqs.(9 ) and ( 10 ) as @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "it may be noted here that although the baryon conductivity vanishes for @xmath69 , the dissipative corrections for the quark and anti - quark densities are finite as seen from eq.(10 ) . it may be mentioned here that for a baryon - symmetric matter , the energy momentum equation given by eq.(6 ) is sufficient to describe the dynamical evolution of the plasma .",
    "however , eq.(10 ) has been derived for consistency and will be useful to study the density evolution in presence of particle production particularly when the chemical equilibration is not complete .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a baryon - rich plasma can be studied by solving eqs.(6 ) and ( 11 ) numerically . for the plasma phase ,",
    "we consider only the u and d quarks for which the energy and baryon densities are given by @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 . the shear viscosity @xmath33 depends on both t and @xmath28 in a complicated way @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in appendix b , we can approximate @xmath73 which scales as @xmath41 in case of a baryon free plasma .",
    "it is found that @xmath74 weakly depends on t and @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we will treat it as a constant parameter for the subsequent calculations .    figures",
    ". 1(a ) and 1(b ) show the time evolution of the ratio of energy density @xmath75 and total entropy @xmath76 for a plasma at @xmath77=1.0 , energy density @xmath78= 9.0 gev/@xmath79 ( corresponding to an initial temperature of @xmath80= 0.258 gev ) with different values of viscosity coefficients @xmath74= 0.0 , 0.5 and 1.0 .",
    "as seen from the figures 1(a ) and ( b ) , with increase in viscosity , the energy density evolves faster than that corresponding to the isentropic expansion ( @xmath81 ) and also extra entropy is produced when the medium is viscous .",
    "figure 1(b ) also shows that most of the entropy is produced in the first few fm / c and the asymptotic value of @xmath82 is approached quickly .",
    "so these results are consistent with the findings of @xcite except that the present work has been extended to finite baryon density .",
    "as mentioned before , the shear viscosity may have an upper bound as given by eq .",
    "however , in the above calculations , we only carry out a parametric study to see the effect of viscosity on the evolution of the energy density and entropy production although some of the @xmath74 values may exceed the upper limit .    figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show the variation of @xmath83 and @xmath84 as a function of @xmath85 for different baryon densities of @xmath86=0.0 , 1.0 and 2.0 at fixed @xmath74=1.0 and @xmath78=9.0 gev/@xmath87 . for a given temperature t",
    ", the viscosity of the plasma at finite baryon density is higher than the baryon - free case ( since @xmath9 increases with @xmath28 ) .",
    "this is true even if the energy density is held fixed since the plasma will have lower initial temperature at finite baryon density ( resulting in higher viscosity ) .",
    "since the viscosity increases with @xmath88 , the temperature t evolves slower and more entropy is produced as compared to the baryon free case .",
    "it is also interesting to note that whatever be the value of viscosity , both t and @xmath28 scale with the same powerlaw as @xmath52 ( see the solid circles in figure 2a for @xmath89 which overlap with the curve for @xmath83 . ) this means the ratio of @xmath28 and t ( i.e. @xmath88 ) remains independent of @xmath85 , consistent with the assumption made in appendix a. this is true even in case of an ideal ( @xmath81 ) baryon - rich plasma where both @xmath28 and t scale as @xmath90 i.e. both obey bjorken s scaling .",
    "however , we have found that @xmath88 decreases with @xmath85 if the hydrodynamical expansion proceeds along with the chemical equilibration @xcite .",
    "the @xmath85 dependence of the chemical potential @xmath28 and the temperature t will be different due to parton production during chemical equilibration .",
    "the plasma in equilibration means there is no net parton production and the momentum distribution of the partons can be described either by fermi - dirac ( fd ) or by bose - einstein ( be ) distribution function .",
    "the picture emerging from the numerical simulations of parton cascades supports the formation of a plasma at rhic and lhc energies which is initially gluon - rich .",
    "rapid gluon scattering at a high initial temperature will lead to substantial thermalization of the plasma in a very short time while it will be far off from chemical equilibrium .",
    "therefore , process of chemical equilibration will proceed along with the dynamical evolution of the plasma .",
    "the process of chemical equilibration will accelerate the cooling of the plasma further and the plasma may not achieve equilibrium by the time temperature drops to the critical value @xcite .",
    "however , all theses calculations assume an ideal plasma where the effects of dissipative processes are neglected",
    ". the chemical evolution of a viscous plasma will be different than its ideal counterpart due to extra entropy production and viscous heating of the plasma .",
    "the distribution functions for quarks ( anti - quarks ) and gluons appropriate for a plasma which has achieved kinetic equilibrium but is far off from chemical equilibrium are given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 s give the measure of the deviation of the distribution functions from the equilibrium values .",
    "the chemical equilibrium is said to be achieved when @xmath93 and the baryo - chemical potential @xmath28 attains an equilibrium value @xmath94 consistent with the baryon current conservation .",
    "it may be mentioned here that although the plasma is dissipative , we use the fd and be distribution functions for quarks , anti - quarks and gluons .",
    "however , the temperature and the chemical potential will evolve as per viscous hydrodynamics and will differ from their ideal counter parts . as discussed in appendix",
    "a , the present formalism of viscous hydrodynamics is not valid for a baryon rich plasma undergoing chemical equilibration . since @xmath88 depends on @xmath85 , additional corrections are needed in the rate equations describing the evolution of the viscous plasma .",
    "therefore , in the following , we have studied the process of chemical equilibration for a viscous plasma only at zero baryon density .",
    "we restrict our considerations to the following two reaction mechanisms for the equilibration of the parton flavours @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the evolution of the parton densities are governed by the master equations @xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 denote the rates for the process @xmath101 and its reverse , and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are for the process @xmath104 and its reverse respectively .",
    "note that the density four vector @xmath105 now includes a dissipative correction @xmath13 .",
    "the rate equations are in general quite complicated to solve . for baryon - free plasma ( @xmath28=0 ) ,",
    "the authors in @xcite , have used a simple factorization for the rhs of the above equations based on a classical approximation i.e. using the boltzmann distribution function for quark , anti - quark and gluon and eliminating the pauli blocking and bose enhancement factors in the final states .",
    "however , it was shown by us recently @xcite that the same factorization can be used , even by including full quantum statistics , particularly when the plasma is highly unsaturated . using the viscous hydrodynamics as derived in the previous section and with the factorization given in ref @xcite , the eqs . ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) can be written as @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108    the above set of equations differ from the corresponding equations of ref.[4 ] with the last terms containing the viscosity factors .",
    "the density weighted cross sections @xmath109 and @xmath110 are given by @xcite @xmath111 using the distribution functions given by ( 14 ) for quarks , anti - quarks and the gluons , the energy and number densities can be written as :    @xmath112.\\ ] ]    with @xmath113 ;   @xmath114  ; where @xmath115 is the dynamical quark flavours .",
    "similarly , the number densities for gluon , quark and antiquark are :    @xmath116    @xmath117    @xmath118    the above set of eqs .",
    "( 17 - 19 ) along with eq .",
    "( 6 ) were solved using fourth order runga - kutta method , to obtain the time dependence of the temperature t , the quark and anti - quark fugacities @xmath119 , @xmath120 (= @xmath121 ) .",
    "the initial conditions were taken from the hijing calculations both for rhic and lhc energies @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath80= 0.57 gev , @xmath122=0.09 , @xmath123 = 0.02 at @xmath124 = 0.31 fm for rhic energy and t=0.83 gev , @xmath1250.14 , @xmath123=0.03 and @xmath124=0.23 fm for lhc energy .",
    "since , energy density depends on fugacities and chemical potential , viscosity will also depend on them implicitly .",
    "figures ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) show the variation of t , @xmath119 and @xmath120 with proper time @xmath85 for @xmath74=0.0 and 0.2 . as mentioned above",
    ", these calculations correspond to a non - equilibrated plasma at zero baryon density . in the absence of dissipation ,",
    "i.e. @xmath74=0 , the plasma cools faster than that predicted by the bjorken scaling ( see the curves with solid circles in figure 3(a ) and 4(a )  ) , since additional energy is consumed in in the process of chemical equilibration .",
    "a further rise in equilibration rate ( i.e rise in fugacities ) will result in faster cooling of the plasma .",
    "the reverse happens in presence of viscosity .",
    "as seen from the figures ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , during chemical equilibration , the quark and gluon equilibration rates become faster when the medium becomes more viscous .",
    "this , however , does not result in a faster cooling of the plasma as expected .",
    "so in the case of a viscous plasma , the chemical equilibration becomes faster and the temperature drops more slowly due to generation of heat . since the presence of viscosity makes the equilibration faster and",
    "also increases the life time of the plasma phase , it would be interesting to see whether chemical equilibration can be achieved when the medium is viscous . while this requires the precise knowledge of viscosity , the short - dashed curve in figures ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) shows the result that can achieved with the upper limit of viscosity @xmath126 ( i.e @xmath127 ) .",
    "these calculations show that even for the limiting case , the temperature may still drop faster than the bjorken scaling and the plasma may not achieve chemical equilibration by the time t drops to @xmath128 gev , provided the initial conditions taken from hijing calculations are prevalent at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the above results are obtained for the chemical evolution of a viscous plasma at zero baryon density . in a recent paper",
    ", we have shown that @xcite in case of a non - viscous plasma at finite baryon density , the rate of chemical equilibration slows down particularly for gluons resulting in slower cooling of the plasma .",
    "therefore , in the presence of baryon density , the cooling rate of the viscous plasma is expected to slow down further",
    ". however , it is difficult to conclude about the net gluon equilibration rate since it is suppressed at finite baryon density .",
    "we have studied the properties of a viscous quark gluon plasma at finite baryon density .",
    "a set of equations that describes the space time evolution of the energy - momentum and parton densities has been derived based on a simple scaling law as well as by solving boltzmann approximation under boost invariant scenario .",
    "the total entropy is conserved in case of an ideal plasma and the temperature and chemical potential evolve as per the bjorken s scaling .",
    "however , for a viscous plasma additional entropy is produced due to viscosity both at zero and finite baryon density .",
    "in fact , finite baryon density makes the plasma more viscous as energy density increases with @xmath28 . even at a fixed energy density",
    ", viscosity rises due to the lower initial temperature .",
    "therefore , plasma at finite baryon density produces more entropy as compared to the baryon free case .",
    "we have also studied the chemical equilibration of the plasma at zero baryon density using the rate equations appropriate for a viscous plasma .",
    "it is found that due to viscosity , the temperature evolves more slowly , while the fugacities evolve faster than the ideal plasma .",
    "the slow cooling of the plasma and the fast equilibration rates of gluon and quark ( anti - quark ) will affect the thermal photon and di - lepton yields which are the important probes to study the dynamical evolution of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "the thermal open charm production will also be enhanced particularly at high @xmath129 or at high invariant mass regions .",
    "the additional entropy which is generated due to viscosity will also reflect on an increased multiplicity distributions of the final particles .",
    "further studies in this direction will be important to understand the behavior of the dynamical evolution of the quark gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "to conclude , larger transverse momentum associated with the hydrodynamic expansion would be reduced as collective flow velocities are dissipated into heat .",
    "the dissipative effects may dampen the fluctuations which otherwise are expected to serve as signatures of unusual phenomena of qgp phase transitions .",
    "since most proposed observables of the plasma are sensitive to the full space - time history of the reaction , dissipative phenomena must be taken into account if quantitative predictions are to be made . in future",
    ", we plan to estimate the dilepton and photon yields from qgp phase with the inclusion of these dissipative effects .",

    "although , gluons equilibrate much faster than the quarks and anti - quarks , we will assume an effective relaxation time for gluon , quark and anti - quark given by @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "neglecting time dependence of @xmath187 one can have @xmath188 @xmath189 therefore , in the presence of dissipation , terms proportional to @xmath190 and @xmath191 are to be added to the eq .",
    "( 3 ) describing the evolution of the energy momentum and parton densities .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for an ideal plasma @xmath192 so that the dissipative correction vanishes .",
    "however , comparing eq .",
    "a(13 ) with rhs of eq . ( 6 ) which has been derived from eq.(4 ) directly , we can write @xmath193 where @xmath194 .    similarly , in terms of @xmath33 , we can have @xmath195 therefore , we can write the following evolution equations in terms of @xmath33 @xmath196 @xmath197 where @xmath198 .",
    "it is also possible to write the density evolution for quarks and anti - quarks separately as : @xmath199 @xmath200 the above equations have the same form as that of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "the value of c lies between 0.83 and 0.86 depending on the value of @xmath55 .",
    "ideally , we expect c=1 from the requirement that in the absence of baryon density all the eqs .",
    "a(17)-a(20 ) should give same solution for temperature .",
    "this deviation ( @xmath201 ) arises due to various approximations that are used in deriving @xmath140 .",
    "for example , we have used an effective relaxation time @xmath143",
    "both for quarks and gluons although @xmath202 .",
    "similarly , we use @xmath203 where a is taken as constant , although it may depend on t. however , the deviation is not too big and we will use c=1 for consistency in the subsequent studies .",
    "it is also important to note that the form of viscosity @xmath204 is also consistent with the results of @xcite which was obtained using finite theory qcd ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the shear viscosity co - efficient using the relativistic kinetic theory for a massless qgp under relaxation time approximation can be written as @xcite @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the energy density of particle type @xmath207 and @xmath208 is the mean free path , which is the inverse interaction rate , @xmath209 .",
    "recently , hou and jiarong @xcite have evaluated the interaction rates for quarks and gluons as for baryon rich plasma using finite temperature qcd _ q = t ,  _ g= t . with @xmath210 where d is the gluon damping factor given by @xmath211 finally , the viscosity co - efficient @xmath33",
    "is given by @xmath212 therefore , the @xmath28 dependence of the viscosity arises through @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "we have studied @xmath214 as a function of @xmath28 at various temperatures t using the following expression for the running coupling constant : @xmath215 where @xmath216=0.1 gev and @xmath115=2 .",
    "it is found that @xmath214 does not depend on @xmath28 very strongly .",
    "even the variation of @xmath214 with temperature is also not very significant .",
    "the viscosity primarily depends on @xmath217 where @xmath9 is the total energy density of the plasma .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath218 where @xmath74 is treated as a constant although it may depend on t and @xmath28 rather weakly",
