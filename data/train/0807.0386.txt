    "@xcite hole - spin coherence times in iii - v semiconductor quantum dots are anticipated to be much longer than electron - spin coherence times due to a weak hyperfine coupling relative to conduction - band electrons .",
    "@xcite in the present work , we show that , in contrast , the coupling of a heavy hole ( hh ) to the nuclear spins in a quantum dot can be rather strong , potentially leading to coherence times that are comparable to those for electrons . however , in the quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) limit , this interaction takes - on a simple ising - like form , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the coupling of the hh to the @xmath3 nucleus , @xmath4 is the hole pseudospin-@xmath5 operator , and @xmath6 is the @xmath7-component of the @xmath3 nuclear - spin operator @xmath8 .",
    "the form of this effective hamiltonian has profound consequences for the spin dynamics .",
    "coherence times can be dramatically extended by preparing the slowly - varying nuclear field in a well - defined state ( `` narrowing '' the field distribution ) .",
    "@xcite for an electron spin interacting with nuclei via the contact hyperfine interaction , narrowing is effective only up to the time scale where slow internal nuclear - spin dynamics or transverse - coupling ( `` flip - flop '' ) terms become relevant . here we will show that heavy holes confined to two dimensions have negligible flip - flops , potentially leading to significantly longer spin coherence times . the strong coupling of the hh to the nuclear spins is not due to confinement but is also present in bulk crystals , while the ising - like interaction is a feature of q2d systems .    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "for a relativistic electron in the electromagnetic field of a nucleus with non - zero spin at position @xmath9 , there are three terms that couple the electron spin and orbital angular momentum to the spin of the nucleus : the fermi contact hyperfine interaction ( @xmath10 ) , a dipole - dipole - like interaction ( the anisotropic hyperfine interaction , @xmath11 ) , and the coupling of electron orbital angular momentum to the nuclear spin ( @xmath12 ) . setting @xmath13 ,",
    "these interactions are described by the following hamiltonians : @xcite @xmath14 here , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the bohr magneton , @xmath18 is the nuclear g - factor of isotopic species @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the nuclear magneton , @xmath21 is the electron - spin position operator relative to the nucleus , @xmath22 is a length of nuclear dimensions , @xmath23 is the charge of the nucleus , and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the spin and orbital angular - momentum operators of the electron , respectively .",
    "nuclear - spin interactions are typically much weaker than the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to form effective hamiltonians with respect to a basis of eigenstates of the coulomb and spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the @xmath27 kane hamiltonian , which describes the band structure of a iii - v semiconductor , provides such a basis .",
    "@xcite the kane hamiltonian is usually written in terms of conduction - band ( cb ) and valence - band ( consisting of hh , light - hole ( lh ) , and split - off sub - band ) states .",
    "we derive an approximate basis of eigenstates in the hh sub - band by projecting the @xmath27 kane hamiltonian onto the two - dimensional hh subspace .    to form effective hamiltonians , we must approximate the crystal - hamiltonian eigenfunctions given by bloch s theorem for a single band @xmath28 : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of atomic sites in the crystal , and the bloch amplitudes @xmath31 have the periodicity of the lattice .    we will approximate the @xmath32 bloch amplitudes @xmath33 within a primitive unit cell by a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( see eq .",

    "the splitting @xmath39 is essential since it produces a well - defined two - level system in the hh sub - band , and we can restrict our considerations to the manifold of @xmath37 states .      before addressing confinement in quantum dots ,",
    "we illustrate that the interaction of an electron in a hydrogenic @xmath0 orbital with the spin of the nucleus ( which we choose to be at @xmath42 ) is generally non - zero .",

    "exactly gives @xmath57    quite significantly , after inserting values of @xmath43 from ref . into eq .",
    "( [ aratio ] ) , we find that the ratio of coupling strengths is fairly large  on the order of 10% : @xmath58 for ga , and @xmath59 for as .",
    "since @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not contribute to the hyperfine interaction of an electron in an @xmath34 orbital , research on hyperfine interaction for electrons in an @xmath34-type conduction band has focused on the contact term @xmath62 , neglecting the other interactions .",
    "the fact that @xmath62 , in contrast , gives no contribution for an electron in a @xmath0 orbital has led to the claim that electrons in @xmath0 orbitals ( and holes ) do not interact with nuclear spins .",
    "( [ aratio ] ) shows that @xmath60 and @xmath61 can contribute significantly .",
    "furthermore , while the interaction of a @xmath44-electron with the nuclear spin is of heisenberg type , within the manifold of @xmath37 states , the interaction of a @xmath45-electron is ising - like at leading order ( virtual transitions via the @xmath38 states may lead to non - ising corrections ) .",

    "the nuclei do not interact solely with the fraction of the hh in the same primitive unit cell ( ` on - site ' interaction ) , but also with density localized at more distant atomic sites ( long - ranged interactions ) .",
    "we neglect the long - ranged interactions , which lead to corrections on the order of 1% relative to the on - site interaction ( see appendix [ appendix3 ] ) .",
