    "although comets hold important clues to the formation of the solar system , there is no complete picture of where comets formed @xcite .",
    "the mixing ratio of the minor constituents of frozen gases in the ice - dust conglomerate of the nucleus is a very important clue to the original composition of the frozen gases in the solar nebula , but it is not well understood . a detailed and comprehensive description of production of minor species , such as s@xmath0 , and their sources , and the inner coma chemistry are prerequisites for unambigous characterization of the nucleus .",
    "understanding comets , in turn , yields insights into the origin of the solar system .",
    "several sulfur species have been detected in comets , including s@xmath0 which has a short lifetime and is concentrated in the innermost coma .",
    "the proximity of comet iras - araki - alcock 1983d @xcite and comet hyakutake c/1996 b2 @xcite to the earth favored the detection of emission lines of such a short - lived species .",
    "recently , s@xmath0 has been detected in comet lee c/1999 h1 @xcite .",
    "up to now pure vibrational models were used to analyse these data .",
    "@xcite , using a multicycle fluorescence model , derived an abundance of 2.5@xmath1 relative to water in international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) spectra of comet iras - araki - alcock .",
    "the model developed by @xcite shows that there is a fast evolution of s@xmath0 fluorescence spectra with the age of the molecule as it undergoes the solar radiation and consequently with the distance to the nucleus . on the basis of this model , it was possible to retrieve an upper limit to the abundance of 10@xmath2 relative to water from iue observations of comet hyakutake which is consistent with the abundance derived from hst observations a few days later @xcite .",
    "the abundance of s@xmath0 in comet lee is 3 - 5 @xmath3 relative to water @xcite .",
    "having applied a time - dependent model of the vibrational population of s@xmath0 to the fullest extent , it appeared that a more extensive model including the rovibrational structure of s@xmath0 was needed to provide additional clues about the physical and chemical nature of the inner coma of comets , especially since high spectral and spatial resolution cometary spectra containing s@xmath0 exist now . in this paper , we decribe such a model suitable for interpreting high resolution spectra of s@xmath0 and we combine the resulting spectra with a global coma model based on gas dynamics and chemistry .",
    "this is important for cometary applications and make it possible to follow the time evolution of s@xmath0 fluorescence in the inner coma .",
    "section [ model ] describes the model and presents our method of calculation .",
    "synthetic s@xmath0 spectra at various age of the molecule are presented in section [ results ] . in section [ comparison ]",
    ", we compare this model with the pure vibrational model and point out important consequences of using a pure vibational model for analysing spectra of even moderate resolution .",
    "we apply our model to such observations , the iue spectra of comat iras - araki - alcock in which s@xmath0 was first detected and discuss the effects on the abundance and lifetime determination . in section [ application ] , we explore the possible applications of this model for cometary observations , both with high spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions and give directions for futur model enhancements in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath5 system of s@xmath0 has been analysed in detail in the laboratory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) but , up to now , there is no complete model of s@xmath0 rovibrational fluorescence .",
    "previous models only took into acount the vibrational levels of the molecule .",
    "@xcite used a multi - cycle fluorescence approach whereas our previous model @xcite gave the fluorescence spectrum at any time after the release of the molecule from the nucleus .",
    "this time - dependent method is quantitatively different from the multi - cycle fluorescence approach . at no time",
    "do we assume that a given level is in steady state .",
    "this allows us to calculate the spectrum of the molecule at any moment .",
    "the period of time elapsed since the molecule release can be very short , of the order of microseconds , or very long , up to the point where steady state is reached .",
    "an immediate difference is noted between our results and those of @xcite .",
    "they argue that the `` first - cycle '' spectrum is achieved only after about 100  s but we find that this spectrum is obtained after a few seconds .",
    "we now have enhanced our time - dependent model by considering the rotational levels .",
    "we calculate synthetic fluorescence spectra of the @xmath4-@xmath5 system of s@xmath0 by solving the evolution equation of the population @xmath6 of the rovibrational levels @xmath7 as a function of time : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the transition probability between levels @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath9 may be either @xmath11 in emission or @xmath12 in absorption .",
    "stimulated emission was considered and found to be negligible .",
    "the einstein coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath13 were calculated using the franck - condon factors from @xcite , the absolute lifetimes from @xcite , and the solar irradiance @xmath14 from @xcite .",
    "the hnl - london factors for @xmath15-@xmath15 transitions are derived from @xcite formulae .",
    "there is no q - branch for such transitions .",
    "in addition to the main branches p and r , satellite branches can also appear with appreciable strength @xcite . at the moment , we did not consider satellite branches in our calculations , but we are aware that this may cause discrepencies with observations at high spectral resolution .    the model was constructed to include a general source ( sink ) term , @xmath16 , for taking into account processes such as collisional excitation ( deexcitation ) .",
    "an estimate of the role of collisions shows that they are likely to be important very close to the nucleus . at a distance of 3 km above the nucleus surface ,",
    "the number density of water ( the dominant gas ) is roughly @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "this results in a collision frequency of 350 s@xmath19 , assuming a collisional cross section of @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "collisional processes may dominate the excitation in this region . at a distance of 400 km which is the approximate range of the observed s@xmath0 emissions ,",
    "the collision frequency is reduced to 8 @xmath22 s@xmath19 , but still comparable to the excitation rate by the solar radiation . the observed s@xmath0 intensity",
    "integrated along the line of sight will contain a contribution from the region near to the nucleus where collisions may be very important and a contribution from further out where collisions may also influence the emission process , but in a more moderate way .",
    "the relative weight of these two types of contributions will require a detailed investigation beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "it should be kept in mind that collision rates of s@xmath0 with other molecules are unknown at the low temperatures typical of the coma . additional uncertainty in the model parameters",
    "would be introduced in order to include these collisional effects .",
    "since the primary aim of this study is to calculate high - resolution , ro - vibrational synthetic spectra excited by solar fluorescence , collisional processes are outside the scope of these calculations . in a subsequent study",
    ", collisional processes will be investigated within the framework of the model outlined above .",
    "we calculated the lines positions using the molecular constants for the @xmath5 and @xmath4 electronic states of s@xmath0 listed by @xcite .",
    "molecular constants obtained from observations @xcite give no significant difference .",
    "we took into account the swings effect due to the heliocentric velocity of the comet .",
    "the initial distribution is obtained with a boltzmann temperature of 200 k , which is a typical temperature of the expanding gas at the surface of the nucleus , predicted by coma models @xcite .",
    "the model s@xmath0 molecule contains 34 vibrational levels in the electronic ground state @xmath23 and 10 in the excited state @xmath24 .",
    "the molecule predissociates above this level @xcite .",
    "we considered hundred rotational levels within each vibrational level .",
    "since deexcitations due to collisions have been neglected , no constraints are imposed on the rotational temperature .",
    "we decided to use a large number of rotational levels even though the higher ones are not effectively populated .",
    "the nuclear spin of s@xmath0 being equal to zero , the anti - symmetric levels are not populated . given the selection rules , we considered more than 2000 rovibrational levels . the problem is to solve the large number of rate equations in the coupled network of ordinary differential equations , subject to the constraint of a conservation equation .",
    "therefore , the problem is overdetermined and one of the equations is redundant . in practice , we solve the complete set of equations and use the conservation equation @xmath25 to check the accuracy of the solution .",
    "the system is solved using the gear method @xcite for stiff differential equations where time constants vary by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this method uses variable time steps and error control techniques to preserve accuracy during the integration .",
    "global linear invariants are found to be kept constant approximately to machine accuracy .",
    "we have developed a global model for the reactive multifluid gas flow in the coma , including gas release from the nucleus , the relationship of chemical abundances in the coma to those in the nucleus ices ( depending on heliocentric distance of the comet ) , entrainment of dust by escaping coma gases , and fragmenation and evaporation of dust ( distributed coma sources ) @xcite .",
    "the model solves the fluid dynamic equations for the mass , momentum , and energy for three neutral fluids ( atomic and molecular hydrogen and the heavier bulk fluid . ) , and the elctrons . in the inner coma , the gas expands ,",
    "cools , accelerates , and undergoes a plethora of photolytic ( with optical depths effects ) and gas - phase chemical reactions that transform the dozen or so parent molecules into hundreds of daughter species . beyond the collision region , the multifluid gas flow for fast atomic hydrogen , fast molecular hydrogen , electrons , and the bulk of the coma gas undergoes a transition from fluid dynamic flow to free molecular flow .",
    "the model produces cometocentric abundances of the coma gas species ; velocities of the bulk gas , light atomic and molecular hydrogen with escape , and electrons ; gas and electrons temperatures ; column densities to facilitate comparison with observations , coma energy budget quantities ; attenuation of the solar irradiance ; and other quantities that can be related readily to observations .",
    "model results are integrated in the line of sight for direct comparison with observations .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the presence of s@xmath0 in the coma of comets @xcite . for our initial model",
    "we assume the simplest possible case : direct release of s@xmath0 from the nucleus with a production rate of 10@xmath2 that of water , in order to simulate observations of comet hyakutake @xcite .",
    "the s@xmath0 molecule photodissociates at one of three assumed rates : 100s @xcite , 200s @xcite , and 450s @xcite , as this rate is not well known .",
    "no dust was included for this work . with such simple chemistry",
    ", we have used our coma model to incorporate dynamical and optical depth effects accurately since s@xmath0 is confined to the innermost region of the coma where these effects are most important .",
    "individual synthetic fluorescence spectra of s@xmath0 are presented in figure  [ f1 ] as a function of age of the molecule , obtained considering an irradiation equivalent to the solar irradiation at a heliocentric distance of 1  au . at short times , corresponding to small cometocentric distances , the brightest lines are in the range 280 - 300  nm ( e.g the 9 - 0 band at 282.9  nm and the 7 - 1 band at 296.1  nm ) and the intensity of these lines does not change a lot with age @xmath26 .",
    "these lines correspond to transitions from the levels @xmath27 = 7 to 9 that reach a value close to the steady state value within 1s , as shown on figure  [ f2]a .",
    "this figure represents the population of the vibrational levels in the b - state , that is the sum of the population of the rotational levels in one vibrational level .",
    "when the time increases , the lower vibrational levels are populated and the lines at long wavelengths become brighter , such as the 3 - 3 band at 324.5  nm or the 2 - 3 band at 328.9  nm .",
    "after a period of time of roughly 100s , the relative intensities of the lines are nearly constant ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) . but inside a vibrational level , the population of the higher rotational levels continue to slowly increase , approaching steady state with the solar irradiation , to the detriment of the lower rotational levels .",
    "our pure vibrational , time - dependent model tended to show that the fluorescence spectrum varies the most between t  =  0 and 200  seconds , when the intensities have reached 90% of the steady - state values , but very little afterwards until about 600s , when steady state is effectively achieved ( figure  [ f2]b ) .",
    "this result is different from the one deduced from our rovibrational model which shows that the global population of the vibrational levels are constant after about 100s .",
    "the numerous rotational levels allow the electrons to reach higher levels at a faster rate due to the overestimate of the einstein coefficients for the emission when ignoring the rotational levels .",
    "using a pure vibrational model to interpret the relative intensities can lead to errors in estimating the effective solar irradiation time of s@xmath0 in the coma which can affect its derived lifetime against destructive processes .",
    "indeed , the s@xmath0 lifetime is not a well known parameter . the lifetime deduced from observations in comet iras - araki - alcock @xcite and in comet hyakutake @xcite , and from laboratory studies @xcite ranges between 100 and 450  seconds .",
    "the last value was derived by @xcite and is consistent with the fact that the steady - state spectrum gives the best fit for comet iras - araki - alcock .",
    "however , we have shown above that even if considering a lifetime as short as 100s , the molecules have enough time to reach a state closely resembling the steady state .",
    "lets consider a lifetime of 200s which is in better agreement with the laboratory calculations @xcite and the scale length of 200  km derived more recently from the iue spectrum of comet iras - araki - alcock @xcite .",
    "the g - factors being very similar to those of the steady - state , the number of molecules in the coma will be the same and the abundance will be roughly twice higher than when considering a 450  s lifetime .",
    "an overestimate of the lifetime leads to a smaller value of derived abundance .",
    "care must be taken when comparing abundance values derived by different groups .",
    "another difference between the two models is the displacement between the band heads considered in the pure vibrational model and the wavelength of maximum intensity resulting from the development of the bands over many rotational levels .",
    "once the rovibrational lines are convolved with a fwhm gaussian of 1.1 nm corresponding to the instrumental resolution of iue , the displacement is around 3   , that is similar to the shift observed in iue spectra of comet iras - araki - alcock @xcite .",
    "an observation of a given region of the coma gives the superposition of emissions of all the molecules in a column .",
    "these molecules are at different cometocentric distances , they have different age @xmath26 and hence have undergone different solar irradiation times . in order to model the s@xmath0 cometary fluorescence , we combined our fluorescence model with a global coma model based on dynamics and chemistry as described in section [ chimie ] @xcite .",
    "the number density @xmath28 of s@xmath0 given by the coma model is shown in figure  [ f3 ] as a function of age @xmath26 and distance to the nucleus surface @xmath29 for different lifetimes : @xmath30 = 100s , 200s and 450s .",
    "we weighted the individual fluorescence spectra with the number density given by the coma model as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the synthetic spectrum obtained at the time @xmath26 since formation of the molecule , @xmath33 is the number density at the distance @xmath29 from the nucleus surface reached by the molecule in @xmath26 , and @xmath34 is the projected distance of the column to the nucleus surface .",
    "the angle @xmath35 varies from @xmath36 to @xmath37 to include the whole column .",
    "we have ignored the greenstein effect for molecules within the column .",
    "the superimposed non - equilibrium spectra that would be detected on the surface of the nucleus and 73  km away from it are plotted in figure  [ f4 ] , using a lifetime of 200  s. the number density decreases by more than 10@xmath38 from the nucleus to 73  km away which causes an important decrease in the emission intensity .",
    "moreover , we observe a shift in intensity from the @xmath39 280 - 300  nm region to the @xmath39 330 - 380  nm region .",
    "the maximum of emissions on the nucleus is the 7 - 1 band whereas at 73  km away from the nucleus , the maximum of emissions has shifted to the 2 - 3 band .",
    "also , bands at longer wavelengths are stronger relative to the brightest bands .    up to now",
    ", we considered an initial temperature of 200 k , which is a correct assumption if s@xmath0 is released from the nucleus .",
    "other mechanisms for the formation of s@xmath0 have been proposed , involving chemical reactions @xcite , or a grain source @xcite . for these alternative assumptions ,",
    "the excitation of s@xmath0 when it is formed is different . however ,",
    "if we consider an initial temperature of 400 k , the effects due to the initial distribution is not perceptible when integrating over the line of sight as soon as one observe a few kilometres away from the nucleus .",
    "practically , we do not observe only one column in the coma but many within an aperture @xmath40 , for instance a slit or a hole : @xmath41 it is important to integrate the weighted spectra within an aperture for simulating real observations .",
    "the spectrum will be different depending on the width of the slit , or if the slit is centered or off - centered from the nucleus .",
    "for instance , we can simulate an observation with a slit having an aperture of 0.87 @xmath42 7.4 \" or 68 @xmath42 580 km@xmath43 centered on the nucleus .",
    "this case actually simulates ground - based observations of comet hyakutake by @xcite .",
    "the simulated spectra are shown in figure  [ f5 ] for the lifetimes @xmath30 = 450 , 200 and 100s .",
    "considering a short lifetime leads to a smaller intensity but the shape of the spectrum is also different depending on @xmath30 ( in particular , the relative intensities between the 280 - 310  nm region and the rest of the spectrum vary considerably ) .",
    "this fact is not relevant for spectra such as iue spectra where the maximum wavelength is about 320  nm but may be interesting to consider in the case of visible spectra such as the ones obtained by @xcite .",
    "we also considered the effect of having the same slit off - centered with an offset of 2  .",
    "@xcite reported that with such an offset , s@xmath0 was no longer detected .",
    "with @xmath30 = 450s , the intensities are reduced by a factor of @xmath39  3 compared to observations with a slit centered on the nucleus .",
    "this factor is 5 with @xmath30 = 200s and 12 with @xmath30 = 100s .",
    "another application of this model is the interpretation of high spectral resolution spectra .",
    "figure  [ f6 ] shows the synthetic rotational structure of the 1 - 5 band for a molecule of age @xmath26=200s .",
    "this band is superimposed with the faint 6 - 8 band ( dotted line ) .",
    "also shown are the modeled lines convolved with a fwhm gaussian of 0.2  , which corresponds to ground - based observations of comet hyakutake @xcite . near the band head , the convolution shows a steep increase due to the overlapping of many lines .",
    "further away , one stucture contains the p and r lines .",
    "this 1 - 5 band was the brightest one detected by @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] lists the most intense bands predicted by the model after 200s solar irradiation time .",
    "these bands were effectively detected by @xcite .",
    "the model shows that they become dominant very quickly once the molecule is released from the nucleus , within 45  seconds ( figure  [ f7 ] ) .",
    "some of the other brightest bands in table  [ tab2 ] were not detected because they are contaminated by stronger emission lines such as bands of oh(0 - 0 ) , oh(1 - 1 ) , and nh(0 - 0 ) . due to no constraint on temperature , the rotational temperature given by the modeled spectrum is too high compared to the 45k observed rotational temperature @xcite .",
    "the upper spectrum in figure  [ f7 ] is obtained for a molecule aged of 1s .",
    "the two bands , 7 - 4 and 9 - 6 , are dominant .",
    "the intensity of these bands , particularly the 7 - 4 band , decrease relative to the other bands when the exposure time increases .",
    "the dominance of these bands in a spectrum with high spatial resolution is therefore a strong indication of freshly released s@xmath0 molecules .",
    "we developed a time - dependent fluorescence model of s@xmath0 and combined it with a global coma model , for interpreting observations in different coma regions . as it takes into account the rotational structure of the molecule",
    ", it can also be used to analyze high spectral resolution observations , such as those obtained in comet hyakutake .",
    "we point out that it is also important to consider the rotational levels of s@xmath0 in the fluorescence calculations to interpret even moderate resolution spectra such as iue spectra .",
    "we also demonstrated the need of a time - dependent model to allow better estimates of the lifetime and to determine the lines characteristic of the freshly released molecules .    in this work",
    ", we concentrated on linking the physics and chemistry of the coma and the cometary fluorescence .",
    "this is the first time to our knowledge that a gas dynamics model with chemistry has been coupled with a time - dependent fluorescence model to analyse cometary emissions , representing a leap forward in our ability to gain insight into the physical and chemical processes in the inner coma and the nature of parent species .",
    "this global model with many detailed processes in the inner coma has great potential to resolve issues regarding the detailed rotational lines intensities as functions of distance from the nucleus , collision frequency , and production rates and to gain insights into the composition into the cometary nucleus .",
    "to this end , the future direction of this work will be to investigate coma temperature profiles , the effects due to optical depth in the inner coma for the emergent s@xmath0 emissions , and also the role of collisions .",
    "considering collisions would allow self - consistent calculations of the rotational temperature for direct comparison to observations .",
    "using the global coma model , we will also consider a more complete chemistry of s@xmath0 , not only photolysis for the production and destruction of s@xmath0 in cometary com .",
