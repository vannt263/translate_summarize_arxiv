    "accelerating massive bodies generate gravitational waves ( gws ) , a potentially rich source of astrophysical information which a number of large experiments have been designed to mine over the next decade .",
    "the principle sources for the interferometric detectors ( ligo , virgo , lisa ) are orbiting bodies , for which the dominant signal is oscillatory .",
    "however , it has long been known that gws will also contain non - oscillatory features , resulting from a net change in time derivatives of the multiple moments of the system  @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear contribution also results from the interaction of the waves with themselves  @xcite . evaluating these modes",
    "involves an integral in time , requiring knowledge of the entire past history of the spacetime .",
    "as such , they have been given the name `` memory '' or `` hereditary '' components of the gw .",
    "the nonlinear memory is sourced by the emitted gws . for a relativistic binary inspiral ,",
    "the typical profile is of a slow growth over time which sees a rapid increase during the late inspiral and merger , and reaches a constant value as the merger remnant rings down and ceases to emit .",
    "the non - oscillatory nature of the memory suggests that it will not be a dominant feature in interferometric detectors , for which drifts in the background metric are factored out .",
    "however , the step induced during merger may be observable in pulsar timing measurements , as has been noted in a recent set of papers  @xcite .",
    "post - newtonian ( pn ) calculations provide an accurate estimate of the memory to within a few orbits of the merger  @xcite , however fail to model the important merger phase where the effect is largest . in a series of papers ,  @xcite has included an estimate of the merger contribution for binary black holes ( bhs ) by using an effective - one - body ( eob ) model which was tuned using the results of numerical simulations .",
    "recent progress in numerical models of bh spacetimes provides the opportunity to measure the effect directly , though as outlined in  @xcite , due to the low amplitude of the memory , and systematic error in standard techniques of wave measurement in numerical relativity , the problem is a challenging one .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a newly developed evolution code  @xcite and wave extraction techniques  @xcite to carry out fully relativistic binary bh simulations to directly measure the nonlinear gw memory through inspiral , merger and ringdown in a gauge - invariant and mathematically unambiguous notion .",
    "we concern ourselves with equal - mass , spinning binaries . for these models ,",
    "the memory is contained in the @xmath1 spin - weighted spherical harmonic components of the gw strain , @xmath2 .",
    "these modes , previously studied in the context of head - on collisions  @xcite , exhibit two dominant effects .",
    "the first is a non - oscillatory term which rises as the inspiral progresses , and is associated with the memory . during the merger , an oscillatory signal is superposed onto these modes , induced by the ringdown of the bh remnant .",
    "after the ringdown has subsided , the modes are offset from their original value .",
    "we find that for the dominant @xmath3 memory mode , this offset is largest in the case of the merger of aligned , maximally spinning bhs , as might be expected given that these are the strongest gravitational emitters @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we observe the strongest oscillatory ringdown signal in the case of lowest total spin ( maximally spinning bhs anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum ) . as such , and as opposed to the observability of the dominant @xmath4 mode , these models produce a more visible @xmath3 mode to interferometric detectors .",
    "we conclude by estimating the strain offset which would be visible to a pulsar timing array .",
    "we integrate the bssnok formulation of the vacuum einstein equations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) numerically , using the ` llama ` evolution code  @xcite within the cactus framework  @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations are discretized via finite differences in space on a grid composed of multiple patches with locally adapted coordinates in the wave zone .",
    "adaptive mesh - refinement is implemented via the carpet grid driver  @xcite on the central patch surrounding the bhs .",
    "importantly for the measurement of small non - oscillatory features such as the memory , the artificial grid outer boundary is causally disconnected from the wave measurements .",
    "we determine initial data for binary bhs by the conformal puncture data method  @xcite , and evolve them using the `` moving puncture '' approach  @xcite whereby the choice of gauge @xcite prevents the spacetime slicing from encountering the curvature singularity  @xcite .",
    "crucial for determining the memory , we compute the gw signal of the source using the method of cauchy - characteristic extraction ( cce ) , which computes unambiguous and _ coordinate invariant _ signals at future null infinity , @xmath5 , corresponding to a detector far removed from the source  @xcite . by this technique ,",
    "metric data is collected on a world - tube at finite radius , and a formulation of the full einstein equations along null hypersurfaces is used to transport the signal to  @xmath5 .",
    "we measure two quantities that encode the gravitational signal at @xmath5 .",
    "the first is the newman - penrose scalar @xmath6 , the weyl curvature component with slowest falloff in asymptotically flat spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we measure the bondi `` news ''  @xcite , defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a derivative operator defined on an outgoing null geodesic , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the newman - penrose shear scalar  @xcite .",
    "these scalars , @xmath6 and @xmath11 , can be evaluated directly from the local curvature on the sphere at @xmath5and in the naturally defined gauge of an asymptotic observer  @xcite . to calculate the gw strain @xmath12 which is observed by a detector , these quantities need to be numerically integrated in time : @xmath13    we expand @xmath12 in terms of a basis of spin-2 spherical harmonics @xmath14 . the dominant non - oscillatory hereditary component is contained in the @xmath3 mode , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the sphere at  @xmath5and @xmath17 is the distance to the source .",
    "since the simulations are necessarily of finite length , the time integration of @xmath11 , eq .  , leaves a constant to be determined , corresponding to the initial value of the signal at the start time of the simulation . for purely oscillatory signals ( e.g. , @xmath18 ) we can fit this by adjusting the post ringdown value to zero , or by some averaging procedure over multiple inspiral wavelengths",
    "this is not possible in the case of the monotonically growing memory .",
    "instead , we approximate an initial value of the @xmath19 mode by matching to a pn calculation , using the 3pn expansion for @xmath20 derived in  @xcite . for spinning binaries we incorporate 2.5pn spin contributions to the frequency evolution  @xcite .",
    "the initial offset of the numerical waveforms is performed by shifting its amplitude so that it fits against the pn models , over an interval from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , the pn solution for @xmath19 in the non - spinning case is plotted as a dotted line in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : memory - vs - time ] . in table",
    "[ tab : memory - vs - spin ] , we report both the overall amplitude offset of the ringdown signal in the @xmath19 mode matched to the pn inspiral , as well as the offset from the point @xmath21 which is computed entirely from numerical data .",

    "the upper panel shows the development of the @xmath3 component of the news , @xmath23 , whereas the lower shows its integral , @xmath19 .",
    "the time coordinate places @xmath24 at the position of the amplitude peak of the dominant @xmath25 mode ( not shown ) , corresponding roughly to the time of merger .",
    "two main features are present .",
    "the first is a slow monotonic growth of the @xmath23 mode during the inspiral and plunge phase .",
    "this corresponds to the non - oscillatory memory contribution . at @xmath26 ,",
    "there is a local maximum in @xmath23 , and shortly afterward a prominent oscillatory signal sets in .",
    "this signal represents the binary merger and subsequent bh ringdown .",
    "it is not strictly an aspect of the gw `` memory '' , as it is not dependent on the entire past history of the spacetime , however it is superposed on the growing memory signal .",
    "the lower plot shows the strain , determined via eq .",
    "[ eq : h_from_n ] .",
    "the superposition of the memory and ringdown signals results in a notable kink in the waveform near @xmath24 , and exponentially decaying oscillation before reaching the steady - state amplitude of @xmath27 we measure approximately 4-th order convergence in @xmath23 when comparing three different grid resolutions for the same model , and we estimate an error on the order of @xmath28 in @xmath23 . the much larger error of @xmath29 in @xmath30 is an upper limit of the estimate on the total error composed of integration error ( [ eq : h_from_n ] ) and error in the pn fit for all of the binary models considered in this paper .",
    "perturbative results provide a prediction for the observed quasi - normal modes ( qnm ) of @xmath23  @xcite .",

    "the overall amplitudes of the final memory are @xmath47 , and @xmath48",
    ". however , these modes are difficult to distinguish from the numerical error , and we conclude that the higher order modes contribute less than @xmath49 to the total memory .",
    "we have performed simulations using the code infrastructure described in section  [ sec : code ] in the two - dimensional parameter space of non - precessing equal - mass binaries with spin that has also been studied in  @xcite .",
    "we have focused on initial data configurations along the two main axes in the space of individual dimensionless bh spins @xmath50 aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",

    "the upper panel shows models for which the spins of the individual bhs are anti - aligned , @xmath51 , so that the spacetimes have the same total angular momentum .",
    "the nearly identical lines are consistent with previous observations that the @xmath4 modes also do not vary appreciably along this direction of parameter space  @xcite , as well as the radiated energies  @xcite , at least not to within the error - bars as stated in the latter reference .",
    "the lower plot shows the @xmath19 modes for configurations with equal and aligned spins , @xmath52 .",
    "the amplitude of the memory offset increases with higher total spin .",

    "we find that the amplitude of the ringdown is largest for models with lowest total spin , @xmath54 . in these cases ,",
    "spin - orbit coupling increases the final angle of impact so that the merger is more nearly head - on .",

    "fits to the qnm frequencies are listed in table  [ tab : memory - vs - spin ] and show good agreement with perturbative results . however , for simulations with @xmath56 the weakness of the ringdown contributes to larger variation in the estimates , particularly if the fitting interval is varied , though still within @xmath57 of the analytic values .",
    "the memory is well estimated by a quartic polynomial in the total spin @xmath58 , @xmath59 determined by a least - squares fit to the measured data .",
    "figure  [ fig : h_fit ] plots @xmath60 as a function of spin for the aligned models , @xmath52 , as well as the leading order multipole moment estimate resulting from the radiated energy ( see @xcite , eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) @xmath61 with @xmath62 the measured radiated energy , @xmath63 , can also be estimated using the quadratic fit developed in  @xcite , verified here with the plotted data points corresponding to the new and more accurate simulations ( see table  [ tab : memory - vs - spin ] ) .",
    "the radiated energy provides a reasonably good estimate of the memory offset , though with a slight under - prediction .",
    "the measured memory values also appear to have a somewhat stronger dependence on the total spin .",

    "the @xmath44 modes are small ( on the order of @xmath68 ) compared to the dominant @xmath69 components of the gw signal .",
    "however , they exhibit both non - oscillatory growth and ringdown features , which present some interesting aspects for detection and identification of these modes .",
    "we discuss the prospects for observation in both interferometers , and pulsar timing arrays , in the following sections .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) within a given detector , @xmath70 , in gw searches based on matched filtering is given by  @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the sensitivity curve of the instrument .",
    "restricting the integral to the @xmath3 mode , we can determine its contribution to the overall snr , testing against the proposed advanced - ligo  @xcite and lisa noise curves  @xcite .",

    "the optimal total mass is @xmath73 ( independent of the model and invariant under the distance ) , i.e.  a @xmath74 binary , for which we list the snr at a reference distance of @xmath75 ( the snr scales linearly with the distance ) .",
    "the lisa results refer to an optimal ( redshifted ) total mass of @xmath76 at a luminosity distance @xmath77 corresponding to a redshift @xmath78 , where models suggest at least one expected merger event per year  @xcite . by assuming a minimum snr of @xmath79 for detection",
    ", it will be possible to observe the @xmath3 mode in lisa out to the given distance .",
    "they are unlikely to be visible with significant event rates within the planned advanced ground - based detectors , though future generation experiments may have prospects .    for both detectors , and",
    "as opposed to the dominant @xmath4 mode @xcite , we note that the highest snr occurs for the cases with spins _ anti - aligned _ to the orbital angular momentum which is due to their stronger ringdown . in the _ aligned _ cases ,",
    "the weaker ringdown causes a much flatter high - frequency fall - off ( figure  [ fig : snr - spin - dep ] ) , and this effect overrides the non - oscillatory step within these detectors .     for different equal and aligned spin models at the optimal total mass @xmath80 ( @xmath74 binary ) at a distance @xmath81 and at an angle @xmath82 .",
    "models with higher total spin ( e.g.  @xmath55 ) have a weaker ringdown oscillation , which results in a higher overall slope and thus smaller amplitude at high frequencies as opposed to models with lower total spin ( e.g.  @xmath54 ) . ]",
    "an important aspect of the matched - filtering algorithm is the construction of templates against which signals are compared .",
    "we examine the influence of neglecting the @xmath40 contribution by computing the mismatch between a signal , @xmath83 , containing all of the @xmath84 modes , with one in which the @xmath40 mode is left out . for advanced - ligo , the mismatch for the model @xmath55 is largest in the mass range @xmath85 , but negligible , with a magnitude of @xmath86 . for the @xmath54 model ,",
    "the mismatch grows to be on the order of @xmath87 .",
    "thus , although the @xmath19 mode induces a notable offset in the wave signal when viewed in the time domain , it makes little difference to the detection algorithms",
