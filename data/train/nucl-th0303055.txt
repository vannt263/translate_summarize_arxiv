    "before the quark matter conference of 2002 , the na50 interpretation of the data on @xmath0 suppression was as follows [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and peripheral @xmath7 @xmath7 data ( up to @xmath8  gev ) can be described with nuclear absorption alone , with an absorptive cross - section @xmath9  mb . at @xmath10  gev",
    "there is a sudden onset of anomalous suppression , followed by a steady fall off at larger @xmath11 .",
    "however , at variance with this view , the most peripheral points in @xmath7 @xmath7 collisions lied above the na50 nuclear absorption curve  which extrapolates @xmath5 and @xmath6 data .    two important sets of new data have been presented recently @xcite @xcite .",
    "the new na50 data on @xmath5 reactions at 450 gev / c indicate a smaller value of @xmath12 than the one given above .",
    "however , within errors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 data can still be described with a single value of the absorptive cross - section @xmath13  mb  substantially lower than the previous one @xcite .",
    "the new , preliminary , @xmath7 @xmath7 data @xcite , taken in 2000 with a target under vacuum , are consistent with previous ones except for the most peripheral ones  which are now lower and consistent with the nuclear absorption curve @xcite . in this way",
    ", the na50 interpretation remains valid .",
    "however , the new data lend support to the interpretation based on comovers interaction  according to which some anomalous suppression is already present in @xmath6 collisions . indeed , in the comovers approach the sudden onset of anomalous suppression due to deconfinement is replaced by a smooth anomalous suppression due to comovers interaction .",
    "the effect of the comovers turns out to be negligibly small in @xmath5 but it is sizable in @xmath6 interactions . with the smaller value of @xmath12 from the new @xmath5 data , there is more room for comovers in @xmath6 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the consistency of the new data on @xmath5 and @xmath7 @xmath7 interactions , together with the final @xmath6 ones , with the comovers interaction model @xcite @xcite .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "since the effect of the comovers suppression is sizable in @xmath6 , but negligibly small in @xmath5 , @xmath12 has to be determined from the @xmath5 data alone . in previous works [ 8 - 9 ]",
    "we have used a value @xmath14  mb , as a compromise between na38/na51 @xcite and e537 @xcite @xmath5 data .",
    "actually , it has been shown in @xcite that the old @xmath5 data are also consistent with @xmath15  mb . as mentioned above ,",
    "this value has now been confirmed by the recent na50 data @xcite , and will be used throughout this paper .",
    "the second parameter in the model , the comovers interaction cross - section @xmath16 , can then be determined from the centrality dependence of the @xmath0 suppression in @xmath7 @xmath7 collisions .",
    "obviously its value is correlated with that of the third parameter of the model , the absolute normalization .",
    "this normalization , in turn , is strictly related to the one in @xmath6 .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath7 @xmath7 to the @xmath6 normalizations is equal to @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this is a rescaling factor which takes into account both isospin and energy corrections . in this way ,",
    "with @xmath12 fixed , the model is strongly constrained .",
    "the main drawback of the comovers model [ 8 - 9 ] was precisely a mismatch of about 30  % between the absolute normalizations in @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the origin of this mismatch is the following .",
    "the high values of the most peripheral @xmath7 @xmath7 data in the former na50 analysis required a value @xmath18  mb .",
    "as stated above , in the new data the most peripheral @xmath7 @xmath7 points are substantially lower and require a lower value of @xmath19  mb .",
    "indeed , a smaller value of @xmath16 ( with @xmath12 fixed ) leads to a flatter centrality dependence of the @xmath0 suppression .",
    "this change in @xmath16 induces a change in the absolute normalization  which is now in good agreement with the ( rescaled ) one obtained in @xmath6 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present a short summary of the comovers interaction model [ 8 - 9 ] . in section 3",
    "we apply it to @xmath7 @xmath7 collisions , where the data allow an accurate determination of both the comovers cross - section and the absolute normalization .",
    "we also compute the correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath20  the energy of the zero degree calorimeter and discuss the @xmath0 suppression in the @xmath20 analysis . in section 4 we show that the @xmath21 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 data can be described using the same values of @xmath12 and @xmath16 as in @xmath7 @xmath7 and a single ( rescaled ) normalization  obtained from either @xmath6 or @xmath7 @xmath7 data .",
    "section 5 contains our conclusions and expectations for @xmath0 suppression at rhic .",

    "the factor 3/2 in ( [ 6e ] ) takes care of the neutrals . in the numerical calculations we use @xmath15  mb .",
    "the value of @xmath16 and the absolute normalization will be determined from the data .    in order to compute the density of comovers we use the dpm formalism described in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the density of charged particles is given by a linear superposition of the density of participants and the density of binary collisions with coefficients calculable in dpm .",

    "the multiplicity of comovers is determined in the rapidity region of the @xmath11 calorimeter .",
    "the factor @xmath38 is introduced because @xmath39 is the charged multiplicity whereas @xmath11 refers to neutrals . in this way",
    "@xmath40 is close to the average transverse energy per particle , but it also depends on the calibration of the calorimeter .",
    "the correlation @xmath41 is parametrized in the form @xcite [ 8e ] p ( e_t , b ) = 1  \\ { - ( e_t - e_t(b))^2/2 q a e_t(b ) }  .    the @xmath11 distributions of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath0",

    "the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath43 are obtained from a fit of the @xmath11 distribution of the @xmath22 event sample is used in the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath0 event sample .",
    "a priori there could be some differences in the fluctuations for hard and soft processes .",
    "actually , it has been claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is a small shift in @xmath11 between minimum bias , on one hand , and @xmath0 or drell - yan pair production on the other hand",
    " induced by the dimuon trigger .",
    "however , this is of no relevance for the present work , since , so far , the only 2000 data available have been obtained in the so - called standard analysis  in which the genuine ratio of @xmath0 and @xmath23 cross - sections is measured . ] .",
    "note that since @xmath44 is nearly proportional to the number of participants ( see fig . 1 of @xcite )",
    ", our fit is practically identical to the one obtained @xcite using the wounded nucleon model .",
    "actually , we obtain identical curves to the ones in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite  where the @xmath11 distributions of @xmath22 events of 1996 and 1998 are compared with each other .",
    "the values of the parameters for the 1996 data are @xmath45  gev and @xmath46 . for the 1998 data ,",
    "the tail of the @xmath11 distribution is steeper , and we get @xmath45  gev and @xmath47 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the product @xmath48 , which according to eq .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) , determines the width of the distribution , is very similar in the two cases . as for the difference in the values of @xmath40",
    "it is just due to its definition , which is different in the two approaches ( eq . ( [ 7e ] ) , in our case ) . ] in the following we shall use the latter values . indeed , according to the na50 collaboration @xcite ,",
    "the 1996 data ( thick target ) at large @xmath11 are contaminated by rescattering effects  and only the 1998 data should be used beyond the knee .    the model described above allows to compute the @xmath11 distribution of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath0 event samples between peripheral @xmath28 collisions and the knee of the @xmath11 distribution . beyond it",
    ", most models , based on either deconfinement or comovers interaction , give a ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath23 cross - sections which is practically constant  in disagreement with na50 data .",
    "a possible way out was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the idea is that , since @xmath11 increases beyond the knee due to fluctuations , one can expect that this is also the case for the density of comovers .",
    "since @xmath49 does not contain this fluctuation , it has been proposed in @xcite to introduce the following replacement in eq .",
    "( [ 6e ] )  : [ 10e ] n_y_dt^co(b , s ) n_y_dt^fco(b , s ) = n_y_dt^co(b , s )  f(b )    where @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the measured value of the transverse energy and @xmath51 is its average value given by eq .",
    "( [ 7e ] )  which does not contain the fluctuations .",
    "the new data @xcite for the ratio of @xmath0 over @xmath23 cross - sections versus the energy of the @xmath11 calorimeter are shown in fig .",
    "they are compared with the results of the comovers interaction model described in section 2 .",
    "as explained there , there are two free parameters in the model ( @xmath15  mb has been fixed )  : the comovers interaction cross - section @xmath16 ( which controls the centrality dependence of the ratio ) and the absolute normalization . a good description of the data is obtained using @xmath19  mb and an absolute normalization of 47 .",
    "the only difference between our result and the one in @xcite resides in the value of @xmath16 .",
    "since the effect of the comovers increases with centrality , a larger ( smaller ) value of @xmath16 leads to a larger ( smaller ) variation of the ratio of @xmath0 over @xmath23 cross - sections between peripheral and central collisions .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in the new na50 analysis the values of this ratio for peripheral collisions are smaller . in order to describe the new data , the value of @xmath16 has to be reduced . the curve in fig .",
    "1 corresponds to a reduction of @xmath16 from 1  mb ( used in @xcite ) to 0.65  mb .",
    "since the values of @xmath16 and of the absolute normalization are correlated , the decrease of @xmath16 induces , in turn , a decrease of the absolute normalization . while in @xcite the value of the absolute normalization was about 30  % higher @xcite than in @xmath6 , the one in fig .",
    "1 is in good agreement with the @xmath6 one .",
    "this will be shown in the next section .",
    "it is interesting that almost the same value of @xmath16 ( @xmath53  mb ) was obtained in @xcite from an analysis of @xmath6 data and former @xmath7 @xmath7 data @xcite which covered a much smaller centrality range . in @xcite the absolute normalizations in @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "@xmath7 were in good agreement with each other .",
    "the @xmath23 cross - section in fig .",
    "1 has been integrated in the dimuon mass range 2.9 to 4.5  gev .",
    "since the @xmath0 peak is inside this range , a model is needed in order to determine the @xmath23 cross - section . in the @xmath6 analysis ,",
    "the grv parton distribution functions at leading order ( lo ) have been used .",
    "therefore , in order to use the ( rescaled ) absolute normalization of the @xmath6 data in @xmath7 @xmath7 ( or vice versa ) , the same grvlo distributions have to be used in the latter .",
    "this is the case in fig .  1 . in @xmath7 @xmath7 collisions",
    ", na50 has also analyzed the data using , instead , mrs 43 distributions .",
    "they have found @xcite that in this case the absolute normalization is lower by about 10  % .",
    "the comparison of the comovers model with the data is presented in fig .  2 .",
    "the absolute normalization is 43 .",
    "the values of @xmath12 and @xmath16 are , of course , unchanged .",
    "the na50 collaboration has also measured the @xmath0 suppression in @xmath7 @xmath7 as a function of the energy of the zero degree calorimeter ( @xmath20 ) . in fig .  1 ,",
    "the results of this analysis have been plotted as a function of @xmath11 , using the measured correlation between average values of @xmath11 and @xmath20 .",
    "we see from fig .  1 that the data obtained in the two analysis are consistent with each other , even for very central events , beyond the knee of the @xmath11 and @xmath20 distributions .",
    "this important result has been predicted in @xcite .",
    "its physical origin is the following .",
    "the energy of the zero degree calorimeter is given by [ 11e ] e_zdc(b ) = [ a - n_a(b ) ] e_in +  n_a(b ) e_in  .",
    "here @xmath55 is the average number of participants at fixed @xmath27  : [ 12e ] n_a(b ) = a d^2s  t_a(s ) _",
    "ab(b )    @xmath56 is the number of spectator nucleons of @xmath57 and @xmath58  gev is the beam energy . while the first term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 11e ] ) gives the bulk of @xmath20 , the latter corresponds to the contamination by secondaries emitted very forward @xcite ",
    "assumed to be proportional to the number of participants , @xmath55 . here",
    "also the value of @xmath59 can be precisely determined from the position of the `` knee '' of the @xmath20 distribution of the @xmath22 event sample measured by na50 @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "( [ 7e ] ) and ( [ 11e ] ) give the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath11 and @xmath27 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "these relations refer to average values and do not contain any information about the tails of the @xmath11 or @xmath20 distributions .",
    "( [ 7e ] ) and ( [ 11e ] ) also lead to a correlation between ( average values of ) @xmath11 and @xmath20 .",
    "this correlation @xcite gives a good description of the experimental one @xcite .",
    "it is practically a straight line in eq .",
    "( ) is practically proportional to @xmath55 ( see fig .  1 of ) . ] and therefore can be accurately extrapolated beyond the knee of the @xmath11 and @xmath20 distributions .",
    "it turns out that this extrapolation describes the measured @xmath61 correlation quite well is essentially due to a fluctuation in @xmath62  which , in turn , produces a corresponding fluctuation in @xmath20 , via eq .",
    " even for values of @xmath11 and @xmath20 in the tails of the distributions .",
    "this result suggests a correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath20 of the form [ 13e ] p(e_zdc , b ) = p(e_t , b ) ( e_t - e_t(e_zdc )  .    folding ( [ 1e ] ) and ( [ 13e ] ) we obtain the @xmath20 distribution of @xmath22 events .",
    "it describes @xcite the one measured by na50 , not only up to the knee , but also in the tail of the distribution .",
    "this result shows that the @xmath0 supression versus @xmath20 is just obtained from the corresponding one versus @xmath11 by applying the @xmath63 correlation , even for very central events beyond the knee of the distributions . in the 1996 and 1998 na50 data , the @xmath0 suppression versus @xmath20 indicated some features ( `` snake shape '' ) not present in the ones versus @xmath11 .",
    "such differences are no longer present in the new data .",
    "let us compute next the ratio @xmath64 of @xmath0 over @xmath23 cross - sections in @xmath6 at 200 gev / c per nucleon in our model .",
    "we use , of course , the same values of the parameters as in @xmath7 @xmath7  : @xmath15  mb and @xmath19  mb . to get this ratio versus @xmath27 ,",
    "the only new ingredient is the multiplicity of comovers  which is again computed in dpm , in the way described in section 2 . to compute @xmath65",
    ", we also need the @xmath41 correlation in @xmath6 , which is parametrized as in eq .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath43 have been obtained from a fit of the @xmath11-distribution of @xmath23 given in @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath66  gev and @xmath67 .",
    "( @xmath68 has not been measured in @xmath6 ) . in @xmath6",
    ", data do not extend beyond the knee of the @xmath11-distribution .",
    "therefore , effects such as @xmath11 fluctuations , eq .",
    "( [ 10e ] ) , are not relevant here .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "we see that the @xmath11 dependence of the suppression is reproduced .",
    "this indicates that there is , indeed , room in @xmath6 for the ( comparatively small ) suppression by comovers . as discussed above this",
    "could also be inferred from the different central values of @xmath12 obtained in @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the absolute normalization of the curve in fig .",
    "thus the normalizations in @xmath7 @xmath7 and @xmath6 are consistent with each other .",
    "this normalization is 4  % smaller than the one obtained from the @xmath7 @xmath7 data  in perfect agreement with the rescaling factor discussed in the introduction .    in @xmath5 collisions ,",
    "the effect of the comovers is negligible and , therefore , the description of the @xmath5 data is the same as in the na50 analysis @xcite , since , as discussed above , the value of @xmath12 they obtain is practically identical to ours .",
    "the corresponding normalization is 20  % higher than the one we have obtained in @xmath6 .",
    "this is also consistent with the expected rescaling factor between the two systems  which takes into account the difference in energy as well as in the rapidity regions covered by the dimuon trigger .",
    "the na50 deconfining scenario has been described in the introduction . in this work",
    "we have presented a different scenario in which the sudden onset of anomalous suppression due to deconfinement is replaced by a smooth one resulting from comovers interaction .",
    "this anomalous suppression is already present in @xmath6 and peripheral @xmath7 @xmath7 collisions .",
    "we have presented a description of the na38/na50 data on the @xmath0 suppression in @xmath21 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath7 interactions in a comovers model . the model is strongly constrained by the existing data .",
    "this can be seen in the following way . in @xmath6 ,",
    "the effect of the comovers is rather small and , thus , once the value of @xmath15  mb is fixed , the absolute normalization depends little on the exact value of @xmath16 .",
    "since the normalizations in @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath7 are strictly related , we are left with a single free parameter , @xmath16 , to determine the @xmath0 suppression in @xmath7 @xmath7 ( both in absolute value and centrality dependence ) .",
    "the model is , thus , strongly constrained and provides a unified description of the data in the various systems . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not possible to describe the former na50 data on @xmath7 @xmath7 collisions for peripheral events in a consistent way .",
    "indeed , these data require a value @xmath69  mb . as shown in @xcite , this , in turn , leads to a mismatch of about 30  % between the absolute normalizations in @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath7 systems .",
    "furthermore , with equal normalizations in @xmath6 and in @xmath7 @xmath7 , the @xmath0 suppression is always larger in the latter than in the former , even for very peripheral events ( see fig .",
    "7 of @xcite ) .",
    "let us discuss briefly the expectations for @xmath0 suppression at rhic in the comovers interaction model .",
    "the calculation of the survival probability @xmath34 is quite safe . indeed , since @xmath16 is a cross - section near threshold , the same value obtained at sps should be used at rhic .",
    "the situation is quite different for @xmath33 .",
    "many authors assume that @xmath12 is the same at rhic and at sps .",
    "it has also been suggested that it can be significantly larger at rhic .",
    "however , it seems plausible that at mid - rapidities , nuclear absorption at rhic is small due to the fact that , contrary to sps , the @xmath70 pair is produced outside the colliding nuclei .",
    "it is therefore crucial to have data on @xmath0 production in @xmath5 interactions at rhic .",
    "if @xmath71 , the @xmath0 suppression at rhic and sps will be comparable , since the smallness of the nuclear absorption will be approximately compensated by the increase of the comovers suppression  due to a larger comovers density at rhic .",
    "very preliminary data tend to indicate that this is indeed the case .",
    "detailed calculations will be presented elsewhere .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the new na50 data in the deconfining scenario is still missing . on the other hand , the centrality dependence of the average @xmath72 of @xmath0 is better described in the comovers approach than in a deconfining scenario @xcite . at rhic energies , a small nuclear absorption in @xmath5 collisions ( i.e. @xmath71 ) ,",
    "would be a very interesting situation in order to discriminate between the comovers interaction model and a deconfining scenario .",
    "indeed , in the latter , the shape of the centrality dependence would be almost flat for peripheral collisions ( below the deconfining threshold ) and would decrease above the threshold .",
    "such a behavior would be a clear signal of deconfinement .",
    "on the contrary , in the comovers scenario , the fall - off would be continuous , from peripheral to central collisions , and determined by the same value of @xmath16 obtained from cern sps data .    5 truemm    we thank n. armesto for discussions and m. gonin , l. kluberg and e. scomparin for information on the na50 data .    99    na50 collaboration , m. c. abreu et al , phys",
