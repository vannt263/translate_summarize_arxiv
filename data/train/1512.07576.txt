    "is the higgs boson recently found by the atlas and cms experiments the only scalar particle , or are there other higgs - like states around the fermi scale ?",
    "this question is of fundamental importance for particle physics , and motivates a detailed study of the phenomenology of additional scalars , as well as the prospects for their discovery at the lhc and future colliders@xcite .",
    "the simplest example of an extended higgs sector is realised adding just a real scalar field , singlet under all the known gauge groups , to the standard model ( sm ) . despite its great simplicity ,",
    "this scenario is of considerable physical relevance , since it can easily arise in many of the most natural extensions of the sm ",
    "e.g.  the next - to - minimal supersymmetric sm ( nmssm ) , twin higgs , some composite higgs models .",
    "in general , such a singlet will mix with the higgs boson . as a consequence ,",
    "both physical scalar states are coupled to sm particles , hence they can both be produced at colliders and be observed by means of their visible decays . in the following , after briefly reviewing the main properties of a generic singlet - like scalar , i shall present the constraints on the existence of such a particle that arise from both direct searches and higgs couplings precision measurements .",
    "let us call @xmath0 and @xmath1 the two neutral , cp - even propagating degrees of freedom , with masses @xmath2 gev and @xmath3 .",
    "they are related to the higgs and singlet gauge eigenstates via a mixing angle @xmath4 . in a weakly interacting theory ,",
    "the couplings of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are just the ones of a standard higgs boson with the same mass , rescaled by a universal factor of @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "their signal strengths @xmath7 are @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the corresponding signal strength of a sm higgs with mass @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the branching ratio of @xmath1 into two 125 gev higgs bosons .",
    "the phenomenology of the higgs system is therefore completely described by three parameters : @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the second state @xmath1 behaves like a heavy sm higgs boson , with reduced couplings and an additional decay width into @xmath12 .",
    "notice that the mixing angle @xmath4 and @xmath3 are not independent quantities , since the former has to vanish when the mass tends to infinity .",
    "indeed , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the first diagonal entry of the mass matrix of the scalar system before diagonalisation , which is proportional to the electroweak scale .    in the limit of large @xmath3 , the goldstone boson equivalence theorem sets the relations @xmath15 the exact formulae for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 couplings are reported in reference@xcite .      0.1 in    .",

    "projections for the reach of future hadron and lepton colliders@xcite are listed in table  [ table ] .",
    "large modifications to the triple higgs coupling can arise in some regions of the parameter space , even if the deviation in the signal strengths is moderate .",
    "future collider experiments , and even the lhc , could in principle be sensitive to these modifications . more details about higgs couplings can be found in@xcite .",

    "both the atlas and cms collaborations provide a combined limit from all the @xmath24 and @xmath25 channels@xcite , with the strongest bound always coming from searches in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 final states . in the di - higgs channel ,",
    "the main constraint comes from the @xmath28 final state@xcite .",
    "all these searches are already sensitive to cross - sections smaller than the ones for a sm higgs at the same mass , and exceed the reach of higgs coupling measurements for low enough  @xmath3 .",
    "projections for future colliders have been obtained in@xcite , rescaling the expected limits from the 8 tev lhc with the parton luminosities of the backgrounds , following the procedure presented in@xcite .",
    "the colliders that have been considered are : the 8 tev , 13 tev , and 14 tev lhc , its high - luminosity upgrade , a possible 33 tev energy upgrade , and a futuristic 100 tev fcc - hh .    figure  [ direct ] shows the present and extrapolated limits on the @xmath29 and @xmath19 signal strengths , normalised to sm values of the cross - sections . in the left panel",
    "the projections for 125 gev higgs couplings measurements are also shown , in the limit of small @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ all ] again shows a comparison between direct and indirect searches , but this time in the @xmath3@xmath14 plane , and for @xmath30 .",
    "the direct exclusion is dominated by @xmath31 .",
    "the higgs sector of the nmssm@xcite contains the two usual doublets @xmath32 , plus a singlet scalar @xmath33 , coupled through a yukawa interaction @xmath34 in the superpotential .",
    "an extra contribution to the higgs mass is generated at tree - level by @xmath35 , and reduces the size of the radiative correction needed to obtain @xmath36 gev .",
    "at the same time , the fine - tuning of the electroweak scale @xmath37 is reduced . in the decoupling limit for the heavy doublet ,",
    "the cp - even states are the sm higgs and the singlet , and can be matched to the previous scenario via@xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radiative correction and @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ models ] ( left ) shows the current exclusions and projections from both direct searches and higgs couplings , in the plane @xmath3@xmath41 , for fixed values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 gev .       and @xmath43 gev ( left ) , and the twin higgs radial mode ( right ) .",

    "this is achieved introducing a copy of the sm field content and gauge symmetries , @xmath45 .",
    "the higgs potential has an approximate global @xmath46 symmetry , which is spontaneously broken at a scale @xmath47 , and the higgs @xmath48 is a goldstone boson of this breaking .",
    "quadratic `` divergences '' in the higgs mass cancel between the a and b sectors , while all the new twin particles are sm singlets .",
    "the phenomenology of the `` radial mode '' @xmath49 is described by eq .",
    "( [ mus ] ) , ( [ mushh ] ) .",
    "the mixing angle is proportional to @xmath50 , and one has @xmath51 the only difference with respect to the previous cases is the presence of an invisible width into @xmath52 and @xmath53 bosons .",
    "figure  [ models ] ( right ) illustrates the present and future constraints in the plane @xmath54@xmath47 , which are the only two free parameters of the model .",
    "one can see that direct searches for the radial mode are the most powerful probe for a twin higgs scenario , at least for not too large values of @xmath54 and @xmath47 .",
    "searches for scalar singlets at colliders can be an important probe for the extended higgs sectors of many physically motivated models , and complementary to the measurement of higgs couplings . by means of only three parameters that determine the phenomenology in a completely general way",
    ", the reach of future colliders in the relevant @xmath55 and @xmath12 channels has been studied . on the other hand , already",
    "the second run of the lhc can efficiently explore this scenario , and will provide valuable information in the near future .",
