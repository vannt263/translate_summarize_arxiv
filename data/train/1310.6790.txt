    "in the universe there is far more matter than antimatter .",
    "the observed amount of baryon number ( @xmath1 ) requires an asymmetry between quarks and antiquarks in the early universe of one part in @xmath2 .",
    "sakharov formulated three necessary and sufficient rules in order for the universe to produce such a matter / antimatter discrepancy .",
    "these _ sakharov conditions _ for baryogenesis are : ( 1 ) @xmath1 is not conserved .",
    "( 2 ) c and cp are not conserved .",
    "( 3 ) the universe should not be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the first two rules are obvious to produce more baryons over antibaryons .",
    "the third rule is required because in thermal equilibrium the number of baryons and antibaryons are equal in a cpt conserving theory .",
    "hence as long as the universe is in equilibrium , the _ net _ baryons that are produced will be washed out .",
    "it was first suggested by kuzmin , rubakov and shaposhnikov @xcite that baryogenesis can occur via an electroweak ( ew ) phase transition .",
    "the process is then called _ electroweak baryogenesis _ ( ewbg ) .",
    "a quick check of the sakharov conditions shows that : ( i ) @xmath1 is not conserved in the standard model ( sm ) due to the rapid anomalous @xmath1 violation at high temperatures .",
    "( ii ) there is cp violation in the electroweak sector of the sm coming from the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "( iii ) if the ew phase transition is first order , it can accommodate the out - of - equilibrium conditions via bubble nucleation .",
    "these are the basic ingredients of ewbg ; an extensive review can be found in @xcite .",
    "ewbg has the following potential problems :    1 .",
    "the interactions following the production of a net baryon number should conserve baryon number .",
    "otherwise the produced baryons would be washed out .",
    "ew interactions violate @xmath1 via a @xmath3 anomaly .",
    "even though the rate of @xmath1 violation is exponentially small ( @xmath4 ) at the weak scale ( since it happens via a tunneling process between vacua with different baryon numbers ) , it is very rapid at high temperatures ( @xmath5 gev ) , and would wash out all the baryons produced , for example , at the gut scale .",
    "however , there is a conserved quantum number , baryon @xmath6 lepton number ( @xmath7 ) in the sm that can be the source of a net baryon number production .",
    "this idea works even if neutrinos are majorana particles ( and hence @xmath8 is not conserved ) . in the case of majorana neutrinos",
    ", the baryogenesis scale puts an upper bound on the neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "cp violation in the sm comes from the ckm matrix .",
    "one can use the jarlskog invariant @xcite to give a parametrization invariant measure of cp violation .",
    "the jarlskog invariant is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mixing angle between @xmath11 and @xmath12 quark , and @xmath13 is the phase in the ckm matrix .",
    "notice that even if the cp violating phase is large , it gets multiplied by small mixing angles , making @xmath14 @xmath15 small .",
    "furthermore , since cp violating processes involve all three generations of quarks , they are suppressed by small yukawa couplings .",
    "it has been shown that the cp violation in the sm results in a @xmath1 asymmetry of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "hence , we need to extend the sm to allow more cp violation .",
    "3 .   if the ew phase transition is first order , the transition causes bubble nucleation .",
    "a first order phase transition needs the order parameter , in this case the expectation value of the higgs filed , @xmath17 , to change abruptly at the critical temperature ( @xmath18 gev ) . inside the bubbles",
    "is the broken phase , with a non - zero @xmath19 of the higgs field .",
    "the rate of @xmath1 violation inside the bubble is proportional to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath22 coupling constant and @xmath23 is the temperature immediately after the phase transition @xcite .",
    "this phase transition can only produce the required non - equilibrium conditions if the rate of @xmath1 violation is slower than the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "this puts a bound on the higgs expectation value ( @xmath24 ) and consequently on the higgs mass . a strongly first order ew phase transition requires a higgs of mass less than 60 gev in the sm .",
    "alternately , with a higgs mass of 125 gev , the transition is a crossover .",
    "rapid @xmath1 violation would then let the baryon number equilibrate to zero if @xmath25 is zero .",
    "one solution to this problem is to extend the scalar sector of the sm to have two higgs doublets .",
    "these are the reasons why we will study two higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) .",
    "it is known that in a 2hdm , one can have a first order electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can have cp violation in this extended higgs sector to generate enough cp violation for baryogenesis .",
    "recently ref @xcite did a numerical analysis of the phase space and showed that cp conserving 2hdms with a higgs boson of mass 125 gev can indeed accommodate a strongly first order phase transition .",
    "the literature for 2hdms is mostly based on cp conserving models because the analysis is simpler .",
    "this is because in the case of cp violation , the cp - even and cp - odd fields mix , making the definition of mass eigenstates more complex .",
    "this complexity limited the studies of 2hdms to either cp conserving models or to small portions of the parameter space of cp violating models , such as those with large mass splittings between the higgs bosons or specific ordering of the masses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a more general study of the cp violating 2hdm is required especially for baryogenesis purposes . in this work ,",
    "i use the fact that we expect the new cp violating phase to be of @xmath26 or less , and give a perturbative expansion of the higgs states in terms of a small cp violating phase .",
    "i focus on the portion of the parameter space that gives a first order phase transition ( e.g. @xmath27 gev , @xmath28 gev ) , and i find the allowed cp violation that is consistent with experimental limits on electron electric dipole moment ( edm ) .",
    "i also comment on how to include cp violation in searches for a first order phase transition in an easy way .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ 2hdm ] , i give the general form of the scalar potential for 2hdms , and calculate the approximate mass eigenstates for the cp violating case . in section [ 2hdmpt ] , i show how to include cp violation in phase transition analyses of the ewbg . in section [ edmsec ] , i show how to constrain the cp violating 2hdm from the limits on the electron edm . in section [ conc ] , i give my concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , i briefly introduce 2hdm , an extension of the sm . our motivation , as discussed in the introduction , is to accommodate ewbg .",
    "the model has two scalar @xmath22 doublets , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "together , they have eight degrees of freedom , three of which are fictitious nambu - goldstone bosons that are eaten by the gauge bosons . hence there are five physical higgs bosons left : two charged , and three neutral .",
    "if there is no cp violation , two of the three neutral higgs bosons are cp - even , and the third one is cp - odd . in the case of cp violation , the cp eigenstates are not the mass eigenstates , since the cp - odd and cp - even higgs fields mix",
    ".    one can impose a @xmath31 symmetry with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , so that there are no flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at tree level .",
    "generically , one can say @xmath30 always couples to up - type quarks .",
    "the rest of the fermion couplings are such that @xmath29 and @xmath30 do not both couple to fermions of a given charge .",
    "hence , there are four types of 2hdms that do not induce fcncs .",
    "later , we will see that this @xmath31 symmetry can be softly broken , which will be the source of the cp violation in the scalar sector . for a more complete treatment of 2hdms , see the review in @xcite .",
    "the top quark coupling is by far the most important yukawa coupling for ewbg .",
    "therefore , phase transition analysis for baryogenesis purposes can be done without specifying a particular 2hdm .",
    "the most general potential that has a softly broken @xmath31 symmetry can be written as @xcite : @xmath34 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\   & + \\lambda_4\\,\\biggl[(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1)(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)-(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_1)\\biggr]+\\lambda_5\\,\\left({\\rm re}(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)-\\frac{v_1v_2}{2}\\,\\cos\\xi\\right)^2+\\lambda_6\\,\\left({\\rm im}(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)-\\frac{v_1v_2}{2}\\sin\\xi\\right)^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 are real .",

    "the dependence of the electron edm on the rest of the parameters can be seen in fig.[l5mu]-[lbeta ] .",
    "there is cancellation between the top- and the @xmath118-loop in some portions of the parameter space , and an @xmath0 cp violation is allowed .",
    "some general observations are :    * it can be seen from eqn.[edm2 ] that the electron edm is proportional to @xmath146 . in order to have a small edm",
    ", there should be good cancellation between @xmath147 and @xmath111 .",
    "hence , larger @xmath111 would require larger @xmath97 ( heavier @xmath148 )",
    ". this can be seen in fig.[l5mu ] and [ l15mu ] . for example , for @xmath149 ( which gives @xmath150 gev ) , @xmath151 with an @xmath152 of mass @xmath153 gev is allowed . these parameters also give a strongly first order ew phase transition @xcite .",
    "* for smaller values of @xmath154 ( @xmath155 gev ) , lighter @xmath152 ( @xmath156 gev ) allows larger @xmath37 .",
    "ref @xcite shows that @xmath157 gev is allowed , while @xmath158 gev hardly gives a first order phase transition .",
    "including the cp violation could eliminate more of the parameter space that allows a strongly first order phase transition .",
    "* the effect of @xmath86 on the edm depends on the parameters , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath61 , and the sign of @xmath159 ( see fig.[lbeta ] ) .",
    "furthermore , a strong deviation from or preference of @xmath136 is not found throughout the examined parameter space ( figures not shown ) . *",
    "if @xmath160 ( and @xmath161 ) , then the electron edm does not depend on @xmath140 .",
    "when @xmath162 , we find that as one raises @xmath140 beyond 800 gev , the dependence of edm on @xmath140 becomes negligible ( figures not shown ) .",
    "we see that @xmath163 ( up to @xmath164 in some cases ) is allowed in a 2hdm by the electron edm bounds . and @xmath165 meson systems .",
    "the ckm phase is of @xmath166 , and is still the main source of cp violation in neutral meson systems .",
    "the ckm phase is not enough to explain the baryon asymmetry because the cp violating processes involve all three generations of quarks , and hence are suppressed by small yukawa couplings . ]",
    "remember that we are introducing cp violation in the higgs sector to achieve the baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "the relation between the baryon asymmetry and the cp violating phase is known only approximately @xcite and definitely needs more cautious studies .",
    "the estimate of ref.@xcite gives @xmath167 .",
    "this estimate suggests that we are very close to seeing a non - zero electron edm .",
    "the baryon asymmetry of the universe can not be explained by the sm ewbg with a higgs boson of mass 125 gev , because the ew transition is not a first order phase transition .",
    "furthermore , there is not enough cp violation in the sm .",
    "2hdms are interesting extensions of the sm , since they allow a strongly first order phase transition with a 125 gev higgs boson .",
    "another feature of 2hdms is that the scalar sector can have cp violation .",
    "this cp violation significantly complicates analyses by mixing cp - even and cp - odd higgs fields . due to edm constraints",
    ", one expects only small cp violation .",
    "i assumed a small cp violating phase , @xmath37 , in the higgs sector , and expanded the higgs mass states in terms of this small phase .",
    "this perturbative expansion makes it easier to incorporate cp violation in the studies that scan the 2hdm parameter space to look for a strongly first order phase transition . a small cp violation is not expected to affect the strength of the parameter transition .",
    "however , it can help constrain the phase space , since some portions of the parameter space that give a strongly first order parameter space would also give rise to large edms .",
    "i also used the analytic results for the higgs states to constrain the phase @xmath37 using electron edm data . with the current experimental bounds ( @xmath168 )",
    "we can accommodate @xmath169 in most of the parameter space studied .",
    "some studies suggest that one only needs @xmath170 to get sufficient baryon asymmetry .",
    "if a factor of two increase in the edm sensitivity does not see a non - zero result , 2hdms become fine - tuned . in addition , we need better estimates of the relation between the baryon asymmetry and the cp violating phase .",
