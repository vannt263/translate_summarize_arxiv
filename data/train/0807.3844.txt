    "cosmic rays with energies exceeding @xmath0  ev are frequently observed by measurements of the fluorescence light emitted in air showers .",
    "the latter are induced by high energy cosmic rays interacting in the earth s atmosphere initiating a cascade of secondary particles .",
    "relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) are the most numerous charged particles in air showers . on their way through the atmosphere they excite nitrogen molecules .",
    "the nitrogen molecules release their excitation energy partly through isotropic emission of fluorescence light .",
    "the fluorescence light is measured with imaging telescopes in air shower experiments , allowing for a three - dimensional reconstruction of the shower profile in the atmosphere .",
    "the main uncertainty of the absolute energy scale of the measured showers is coming from the fluorescence light yield of electrons in air .",
    "the bulk of the fluorescence light is induced by electrons with mev energies .",
    "thus , the emission mechanism can be studied in laboratory experiments using particles , mainly electrons , from radioactive sources or particle accelerators .",
    "particles are injected into volumes of nitrogen and air under well controlled circumstances and the fluorescence light yield is measured as a function of various parameters , like electron energy , gas pressure , temperature , and humidity .",
    "recent developments have been discussed during the 5th fluorescence workshop in el escorial , spain from september 16th to 20th , 2007 .",
    "the results are summarized in an accompanying article @xcite .",
    "the present article summarizes measurements of the fluorescence light yield conducted between 1954 and 2000 .",
    "the objective is to compile information relevant for air shower observations from the ( sometimes hardly accessible ) historical papers .",
    "their implications on the contemporary understanding of the subject are discussed in @xcite .",
    "very early investigations of fluorescence emission in gases induced by rapid particles were performed by grn and schopper  @xcite in 1954 . in the experimental setup , described in the paper , @xmath1-particles from a radioactive po - source",
    "were used to excite the gas .",
    "the measurements were done mainly in nitrogen gas and nitrogen argon mixtures , but also in nitrogen gas with different admixtures like xe , o@xmath2 , etc .",
    "the fluorescence yield @xmath3 from grn and schopper corresponds to @xmath4 .",
    "] was defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radiation power in w/@xmath7 and @xmath8 is the de - acceleration power , also in w/@xmath7 , of the primary particle stream in the gas .",
    "the fluorescence yield depends on @xmath9 , the particle number density of the gas , @xmath10 is the temperature of the gas , @xmath11 is the concentration of the admixture to the nitrogen , and @xmath12 is the velocity of the exciting particles as it enters the gaseous volume . the radiation power was measured photo - electrically with a photomultiplier 1 @xmath13 28 .",
    "the experimental setup was chosen carefully , since the measured stream of photons yields only the fluorescence yield under the following conditions , as stressed in the publication  @xcite :    1 .",
    "the gas volume has to be independent of the variable which is varied during the measurement .",
    "then the proportionality between the measured photo - stream and the radiation power @xmath6 is fulfilled .",
    "2 .   the dependence of the decelerations power @xmath8 on the varied variable has to be known .",
    "the derived ratio @xmath14 is proportional to the outer fluorescence yield .",
    "3 .   the emitted radiation must not be absorbed by the gas itself .",
    "this ensures that the outer yield is equal the inner fluorescence yield .",
    "the spectral combination of the radiation must be constant because of the selective sensitivity of the photo cathode .    additionally , the setup was such that no @xmath1-particle hits any wall within the measurement volume . to account for deceleration of the exciting particles before and in the observed volume under high pressure conditions ,",
    "a pressure - dependent correction factor was introduced .",
    "firstly , the pressure - dependence of the fluorescence yield @xmath15 was measured for constant temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the fluorescence yield was written in dependence on pressure @xmath16 from grn and schopper corresponds to @xmath13 and @xmath17 to @xmath18 . ] as @xmath19 with @xmath20 as the mean lifetime of the excited molecule with respect to quenching .",
    "@xmath21 is the yield for @xmath22 meaning maximal yield .",
    "@xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the mean lifetime without quenching .",
    "@xmath26 means the `` quenching velocity '' and can be given as @xmath27 @xmath28 is the mean relative velocity of the gas molecules and @xmath29 is the temperature - dependent quenching cross section .",
    "in pure nitrogen , the fit to the data points led to a value of @xmath30 = 35  torr  @xcite .",
    "the authors concluded a ratio between @xmath31 and @xmath25 of 0.05 at 760  torr and 20@xmath32c .",
    "the estimated mean lifetime @xmath31 of the c@xmath33-state of n@xmath2-molecules with respect to quenching was about 5@xmath34  sec with @xmath35  sec .",
    "it was pointed out that the quenching cross section @xmath36 is smaller by a factor of 1/2.5 compared with the gas - kinetic cross section of n@xmath2-molecules .",
    "secondly , the temperature dependence of the fluorescence yield was discussed .",
    "it was stated that this dependence is caused by the temperature dependence of the quenching process .",
    "measured data were plotted for the function @xmath37 .",
    "the authors concluded that the quenching cross section @xmath36 decreases with increasing temperature apart from a @xmath38-increase of the mean relative velocity @xmath39 of molecules with increasing temperature .",
    "thirdly , the role of secondary electrons and the concentration - dependent light yield of ar - n@xmath2-mixtures was analyzed  @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic investigation started with pure argon and n@xmath2 was added successively . in pure ar ,",
    "the radiation power stems from ar spark lines induced by ionization . in pure nitrogen ,",
    "the emission comes mainly from the second positive system and smaller contributions from n@xmath40 .",
    "it was found that already at small concentrations of n@xmath2 , the light yield is significantly increased .",
    "the authors explained it by an energy transfer from ar to n@xmath2 .",
    "the deceleration power of the incoming particles is absorbed by both gases and part of the energy absorbed by argon is transferred to nitrogen which then radiates fluorescence light .",
    "the idea of energy transfer is supported by the fact that the c@xmath41-state of n@xmath2 can not be excited directly by primary particles .",
    "the obtained concentration - dependent light yield curve is the result of the concentration dependence of the energy transfer and of concentration - dependent quenching .",
    "the steep increase of the yield curve already at small nitrogen concentrations was explained by the authors with large cross sections for the process of energy transfer . with increasing nitrogen concentration , the energy transfer saturates and decreases afterwards because of the decreasing ar - concentration .",
    "additionally , the quenching due to argon in the nitrogen gas superimposes . in conclusion",
    ", it was stated that the energy transfer occurs mainly due to secondary electrons from argon .",
    "three years later , grn published measurements of fluorescence yield in air  @xcite .",
    "he used a parallel , narrow beam of electrons with energies between 4.2 and 43.7 kev .",
    "the aim of the investigation was to determine the light yield as a function of the gas density .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath15 was measured at constant temperature @xmath42c within the pressure range from 10 to 600  mm  hg . from a description of the fluorescence mechanism , grn deduced the proportionality @xmath43 a linear fit to the data points yielded a @xmath44  mm  hg for air as an average over a large spectral range .    in the following years",
    ", the aurora phenomena in the earth s atmosphere came more and more into focus .",
    "several investigations about light yield , excitation and de - excitation processes were carried out .",
    "these studies were performed in pure nitrogen or air , because also the aurora phenomena are mainly nitrogen scintillation high up in the atmosphere . here ,",
    "only some of the experiments are mentioned exemplarily whose results are used later in the discussions about nitrogen fluorescence induced by extensive air showers .",
    "in 1964 , brocklehurst published quenching parameters for nitrogen - nitrogen and nitrogen - oxygen collisional de - excitation  @xcite . to this end",
    ", he measured the light emission in pure nitrogen gas and in nitrogen - oxygen mixtures within a pressure range of 1 to 750  mm  hg .",
    "the excitation was performed by soft x - rays .",
    "the spectrum was presumably continuous between 5 and 45  kev with a maximum intensity at about 25 to 30  kev .",
    "the emission spectra were observed using a spectrograph and intensity measurements were done with a 1 @xmath13 28 photomultiplier .",
    "main contributions to the light yield were identified to be of the second positive bands ( @xmath45 ) of n@xmath2 and of the first negative bands ( @xmath46 ) of n@xmath40 .    for studying the kinetics of collisional processes ,",
    "the pressure was chosen to be higher than 1  mm  hg , since above this value the excitation conditions are independent of pressure  @xcite .",
    "it is mentioned that secondary electrons cause excitation above 10@xmath47  mm  hg , but are completely absorbed in the gas for pressure higher than 1  mm  hg .",
    "furthermore , the excitation is assumed to be without ion recombination processes .",
    "former measurements are cited in the publication by brocklehurst  @xcite showing that fields applied for the removal of ions do not have any effect on the light output .",
    "an iterative procedure was applied in the analysis of the quenching parameters for separating between 1  n and 2  p states of nitrogen .",
    "the factor @xmath48 , which is given in the publication , corresponds to @xmath49 in modern nomenclature .",
    "the necessary fits to the data were done in the low - pressure range up to 150  mm  hg for 2  p and up to 40  mm  hg for 1  n. for higher pressure , quenching effects make the data points deviate from the linear dependence found at low pressure . to extract collisional cross sections , the author used the lifetimes from bennett and dalby  @xcite which are ( 4.45 @xmath50 0.6 ) @xmath51  sec for the 2p system and ( 6.58 @xmath50 0.35 ) @xmath51  sec for the 1n system .",
    "the results are listed in table  .    .quenching parameters given in brocklehurst , 1964  @xcite .",
