    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite is the most well - known example of a disordered and frustrated system in the field of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the infinite - range version of the edwards - anderson ( ea ) model introduced earlier in 1975 @xcite . in the ea model quenched disorder",
    "is introduced in the random sign of the exchange couplings between nearest - neighbor spins on a lattice .",
    "the infinite - ranged version is the natural mean - field version of the ea model , in the same sense as the infinite - range ferromagnet is the mean - field theory for the ising model .",
    "a nearly complete solution of the sk model has been found @xcite which has raised subtle questions about the nature of the spin - glass phase showing that the mean field theory of spin glasses is considerably more complex than the standard mean field of say ferromagnetic systems .",
    "plenty of new questions were posed after it was shown that the correct thermodynamic solution had to be understood in terms of a replica - symmetric broken solution .",
    "for instance , does the ergodicity breaking ( implied by replica symmetry breaking ) also occur in short - range systems ?",
    "also , has replica symmetry a true physical meaning in as much as time - reversal symmetry has for usual ferromagnets ?",
    "after many years of research these questions have turned out to be extremely difficult and in the meantime criticisms questioning their relevance regarding our understanding of experimental systems have also been raised .",
    "scaling theories of finite dimensional spin glasses , so called droplet models @xcite , seem to be at variance with the image of replica symmetry breaking .",
    "it is thus useful to introduce new solvable models which correspond to mean field versions of different finite dimensional problems in order to improve our understanding of the spin - glass problem .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new solvable spin - glass model which corresponds to the mean - field version of the edwards - anderson model but including next - nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "we will refer to this new model as nnn - sk model .",
    "the motivation is that the model admits the possibility of being realized on a finite - dimensional lattice and incorporates correlations between the first nearest - neighbor and second - nearest neighbor coupling interactions . at a first glance it seems strange to consider a next nearest neighbor interaction in a totally connected spin - glass model",
    ", however we shall see that the correlations introduced in the couplings can lead to a physics different to that of the sk model .",
    "in addition this model allows one to discuss the role of the density eigenvalues of the interaction matrix in the spin - glass behavior .",
    "the model we study is a totally connected one with hamiltonian @xmath0 the spins @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are ising spins taking the values @xmath3 . here",
    "we take the interaction matrix @xmath4 to be a nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor type interaction    @xmath5    where the @xmath6 are independent gaussian random variables such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",
    "the over - line denotes the disorder averaging and we note that the matrix @xmath9 here is not symmetric . the same model with @xmath9 symmetric",
    "may be studied , however taking @xmath9 non - symmetric considerably simplifies the analytical study of the model .    in this paper",
    "we will consider two models .",
    "the positive temperature model where @xmath10 ( we will refer to this as the @xmath11 model ) and the negative temperature model where @xmath12 ( we will refer to this as the @xmath13 model ) .",
    "contrarily to what happens in the usual sherrington - kirkpatrick model , the model ( [ eqh ] ) is not invariant under the transformation @xmath14 .",
    "clearly @xmath4 is a matrix which is positive definite and @xmath15 a matrix which is negative definite .    for a symmetric matrix @xmath9 taken from the gaussian ensemble ,",
    "the density of eigenvalues @xmath16 is given by the wigner semi - circle law @xcite    @xmath17    with @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "in corresponding the spherical spin model @xcite , at low temperature , the system minimizes its energy via a macroscopic condensation onto the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath19 . in the case of the sk model",
    "this condensation is not possible due to the discrete nature of the spins , however it seems reasonable to assume that the density @xmath20 for @xmath21 plays an important role in the low temperature behavior . in our model ,",
    "if @xmath9 is taken to be symmetric , the density of eigenvalues @xmath22 is clearly given by @xmath23 where now @xmath24 $ ] in the @xmath25 or @xmath11 model and @xmath26 $ ] for the @xmath15 or @xmath13 model .",
    "in fact one can show that @xcite this is also the density of eigenvalues in the case of @xmath9 non - symmetric .",
    "hence in the positive case , the low energy region of the interaction matrix has the same form as the sk model and one would have in a spherical model a condensation onto the eigenvector of largest eigenvalue . in the negative case",
    "however the largest eigenvalues are at @xmath27 , but the density of eigenvalues now diverges in this region . in the corresponding spherical model it is easy to see that this eliminates the finite temperature phase transition .",
    "this happens in exactly the same way that the divergence of the density of occupation of the zero energy states for free bosons in two or less dimensions eliminates the finite temperature bose einstein transition .    in the following treatment",
    "we consider the @xmath11 model although the same mathematical treatment we present here can be applied to the @xmath13 case on changing the sign of the inverse temperature @xmath28 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model can thus be written as    @xmath29    and the partition function for the model is therefore given by @xmath30\\ ] ] in order to facilitate taking the disorder average we make a hubbard stratonovich transformation by introducing the auxiliary gaussian spins @xmath31 to obtain @xmath32 \\label{eqlittle}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 indicates the trace over the gaussian spin @xmath34 and is defined by @xmath35 in the form ( [ eqlittle ] )",
    "the model is that of an asymmetric little model @xcite but where one of the two sets of spins is gaussian rather than ising .",
    "interest in the little model arose one decade ago , in the context of neural networks as the parallel dynamics of the standard hopfield model @xcite coincides with the sequential dynamics in the little model @xcite .",
    "the corresponding mean - field spin - glass model was studied in @xcite where it was shown that the equilibrium behavior is the same for both the sk and little ( for both asymmetric and symmetric couplings ) models .",

    "let us mention that , while for the positive k model we achieved thermalisation in a range of temperatures in the vicinity of @xmath80 , for the negative @xmath4 model thermalisation was hardly achieved due to the quite small acceptance rate for all the temperatures simulated .",
    "this behavior is due to the small value of the relevant temperatures of the @xmath13 model where the transition occurs ( one order of magnitude smaller ) . because the typical energy change for both models is the same , the boltzmann factor",

    "( [ ene-],[c- ] ) .    as we said before we did not succeed in thermalising the model at low temperatures to extract the behavior of the order parameters .",
    "consequently we do not have good data for the kurtosis @xmath168 ( [ eqb ] ) and the opf @xmath166 ( [ eqg ] ) . the only transition about which we may have some hints is the dynamical transition where dynamics becomes extremely slow .",
    "one could be tempted to interpret the crossing point for the specific heat at different sizes ( fig .",

    "despite of the fact that this interpretation seems reasonable we are not absolutely certain and so we prefer to leave this question open .",
    "more evidence for the dynamical transition can be obtained by doing annealing experiments for finite cooling rates and very large sizes .",

    "( [ cooling ] ) for a system of size @xmath169 was cooled down to very low temperatures staying for @xmath156 mcs at each temperature and changing @xmath141 by @xmath170 .",
    "the system gets trapped below a crossover temperature @xmath171 and starts to deviate from the high - t line .",
    "we plot two independent dynamical histories to demonstrate how the departure from the ergodic line depends on the dynamical history signaling the presence of non - ergodic effects in the dynamics ( below @xmath172 the typical relaxation time has become much larger than the time the system remains at each temperature , i.e. @xmath156 ) .",
    "note that in this dynamical study the static transition @xmath92 remains completely hidden .",
    "at this temperature no divergence of a relaxation time can be observed since that time has already diverged above at the dynamical transition .",
    "the only way to show the existence of this transition is by estimating the configurational entropy and determining the temperature at which that quantity vanishes .",
    "such a task has been successfully undertaken in the case of the random - orthogonal model @xcite which displays a very similar behavior to the @xmath13 model and requires the use of projection techniques , in the spirit of those introduced by stillinger and weber , for the study of the potential energy landscape in the context of glasses @xcite .",
    "in this paper we introduced a solvable model of a spin - glass corresponding to the mean - field version of the nearest and next nearest neighbor spin - glass model .",
    "the main interest of the model is that it shows how correlations in the couplings may completely change the character of the spin - glass transition from continuous replica symmetry breaking to a one - step transition .",
    "we analyzed two cases , the positive model @xmath11 with a phase transition and behavior similar to that of the sk model and the @xmath13 model with ideal mode - coupling behavior and a phase transition similar to the rom or to the @xmath152-spin model .",
    "the different character of the transition in both models can be ascribed to the different behavior of the eigenvalue density distribution close to the maximum eigenvalue or threshold . for the @xmath11",
    "the distribution vanishes at the threshold ( i.e. @xmath173 ) and the equilibrium distribution _ condensates _ around configurations in the vicinity of the maximum eigenvector . for the @xmath13",
    "the eigenvalue density diverges at the threshold ( i.e. @xmath174 ) . in that case , the equilibrium configuration _ condensates _ around an extremely large number of eigenvectors with eigenvalue close to 0 .",
    "hence , the phase space splits into a very large number ( exponentially large with the size of the system ) of ergodic components or phases , these phases corresponding to different eigenvectors with eigenvalue very close to the threshold which extensively contribute to the configurational entropy .",
    "obviously , eigenvectors of the coupling matrix never coincide with possible configurations of the ising system , so this argumentation must be taken only as a rough picture .",
    "nevertheless , the idea that the type of eigenvalue distribution determines the character of the transition seems quite intuitive .",
    "actually , if one considers spherical instead of ising spins then the transition disappears for the @xmath13 model but persists for the @xmath11 case . for the @xmath13 model",
    "the transition disappears because there is no longer a vanishing of the configurational entropy ( the classical nature of spins allows for a negative entropy ) .",
    "the same mechanism occurs in the rom where the one - step transition with ising spins disappears in case of spherical spins . in this case , the density of eigenvalues is given by @xmath175 showing that the density diverges in the vicinity of the maximum eigenvalue .    what is the real connection between the density of eignevalues and the order of the transition ?",
    "the mechanism which makes a continuous transition become first order ( in the order parameter ) in spin - glass theory is well known and based on the role of the so called complexity or ( sometimes misleadingly ) configurational entropy @xcite . in mean - field theory",
    "the complexity @xmath176 at a given free energy and temperature corresponds to the logarithm of the number of tap free energy minima solutions with that free energy and temperature .",

    "this quantity display two types of different behaviors at low enough temperatures . for models with continuous replica symmetry breaking",
    "@xmath178 has a single minimum at the equilibrium free energy value @xmath179 while for models with a one - step scenario this function may display a minimum at a threshold value @xmath180 higher that the equilibrium free energy @xmath181 .",
    "the difference @xmath182 defines the complexity at that temperature @xmath183 which is positive for one - step models but vanishes in continuous models . because at high free energies @xmath184 it is clear that the abundance of metastable solutions makes @xmath185 always larger raising the possibility that the potential @xmath186 displays a minimum above the equilibrium free energy .",
    "therefore , a divergence of the eigenvalue density at the lowest value goes in the appropriate direction of generating a minimum in @xmath178 and hence making the transition become first - order in the order parameter .    as for further directions of interest we mention the investigation of the existence of a model interpolating between the @xmath11 and @xmath13 models .",
    "this would be very interesting to understand better the mechanism which makes the spin - glass transition change from a continuous one to a discontinuous one , as well as to connect this change with the behavior of the density of eigenvalues close to the threshold .",
    "in this direction it would be also interesting to investigate in a general way the type of phase transition for a generic eigenvalue distribution using analytical techniques such as those developed for the rom model @xcite",
    ".    it would also be interesting to investigate the behavior of the different terms in the tap expansion to see how this change of behavior occurs and how this is related to the geometrical properties of the free energy landscape .",
    "note that the information contained in the density of eigenvalues is closely related to the topological features of the energy landscape .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to think that the nature of the transition in these models arises from the geometrical properties of the energy ( and hence , the free energy ) landscape .",
    "finally , we would like to investigate the behavior of this model on a finite dimensional lattice . in the simplest way this can be done taking @xmath9 to be nearest - neighbor gaussian matrix and defining @xmath4 according to ( [ kj ] ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to see how the two universality classes describing the mean - field behavior are modified in the presence of activated processes and how they manifest themselves in the dynamical properties of realistic systems .",
    "this could give additional understanding about why some models behave in one way or another and how topological properties of the landscape influence the dynamical behavior of real systems .",
