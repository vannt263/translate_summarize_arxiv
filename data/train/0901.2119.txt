    "psr  j0205 + 6449  is a 65-ms rotation - powered pulsar residing in the center of the supernova remant 3c  58 .",
    "the pulsar was discovered in a 2002 _ chandra x - ray observatory _  ( _ cxo _ ) observation of the source @xcite and subsequently detected as a radio pulsar @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most energetic pulsars in the galaxy , with a spin - down luminosity of @xmath5ergs@xmath6 .",
    "the possible association between the 3c  58 pulsar / pulsar wind nebula complex and the historical supernova sn 1181 has been a matter of debate .",
    "3c  58 is the only known source positionally coincident and energetically compatible with the historical supernova , strongly suggesting an association @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years , evidence has been mounting that the association may be spurious and that the true age of the pulsar may be closer to its characteristic age , @xmath7kyr ( where @xmath8 is the pulsar s rotation frequency and @xmath9 its derivative ) , rather than the implied historic age of 828yr .",
    "if the source is 828yr - old , the size of the remnant implies a large expansion velocity that is hard to reconcile with the measured velocities of the optical filaments @xcite and the expansion speed of the synchrotron bubble @xcite .",
    "the characteristic age estimate assumes that the pulsar was born spinning rapidly ( @xmath10 ) and that the temporal spin evolution of the pulsar has proceeded according to a simple magnetic dipole spin - down model .",
    "these assumptions are known to fail in some cases , such as for psr  j1811@xmath111925 in the supernova remnant g11.2@xmath110.3 , for which the pulsar s characteristic age appears to be a factor of @xmath215 greater than that of the remnant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the two ages can be reconciled if psr  j1811@xmath111925 was born spinning slowly , with @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , the pulsar j0538 + 2817 has a characteristic age of 620kyr , but a well established kinematic age of @xmath240kyr , implying a long initial spin period of @xmath2138ms @xcite .",
    "likewise , if psr  j0205 + 6449  was born spinning with a period of @xmath260ms , the estimated age of the pulsar could be reconciled with the historical supernova age @xcite .",
    "an alternate explanation of the age disparity for psr  j0205 + 6449  is if the pulsar were born with a short spin period but evolved more rapidly than is typically assumed for magnetic dipole braking .    in principle",
    ", it may be possible to to gain information about a pulsar s true age via its glitching behavior .",
    "pulsars in general , and young pulsars in particular , exhibit two types of rotational irregularities superposed on their secular spin down .",
    "glitches are characterized by a sudden increase in @xmath8 , sometimes followed by an exponential decay , and are often accompanied by an increase in the magnitude of @xmath9 .",
    "glitches are common in young pulsars , particularly in pulsars aged @xmath210 - 100kyr , and provide valuable information about the superfluid interiors of pulsars .",
    "the fractional sizes of detected glitches span 5 orders of magnitude , with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the nature of glitches appears to change with age .",
    "glitches in the youngest crab - like pulsars ( 1 - 2kyr ) tend to be small in magnitude , @xmath14 , and if the frequency recovers , it tends to recover almost completely .",
    "by contrast , glitches in older vela - like pulsars are typically larger , with magnitudes of @xmath15 , and typically recover only a small percentage of the frequency change @xcite .",
    "young pulsars are also prone to large stochastic variations in their spin - down rates , known as timing noise .",
    "these noise processes are observed as long - term trends in timing residuals after the removal of deterministic spin - down effects .",
    "timing noise tends to be the most severe in young pulsars and a correlation with @xmath9 is well established @xcite .",
    "the low - frequency and broad - band nature of timing noise leads to difficulties in its analysis .",
    "moreover , the physical causes of timing noise are poorly understood .",
    "it could be that fluctuations in the superfluid interiors of neutron stars cause a torque on the pulsar @xcite , or that interactions between the pulsar and the magnetosphere impart a torque @xcite , to name two possibilities .    in this paper , we present three coherent timing solutions for psr  j0205 + 6449  spanning 6.4yr with data obtained from the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , the jodrell bank observatory ( jbo ) and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "we discuss two large glitches and timing noise found in these data .",
    "we also present an analysis of the high energy emission of the pulsar from the _ rxte _  data by examining the x - ray pulse profile from 2  ",
    "40kev and the phase offset between the radio and x - ray pulses .",
    "x - ray observations were taken with _ rxte _ ; radio observations were taken with the gbt and jbo , as detailed below .",
    "the data were unevenly spaced throughout 6.9yr , as shown in figure [ fig : dist ] , and include a 202-day gap ( between observations taken in _ rxte _  cycle 6 and cycle 7 ) and a 287-day gap ( corresponding to cycle 8) .",
    "gbt data are shown with short lines , _ rxte _  data are shown with medium - length lines , and jbo data are shown with long lines .",
    "the first set of observations from _ rxte _  cycle 6 are only considered for the pulse profile analysis (  [ sec : profile ] ) and are not included in the 6.4yr of data for our timing analysis (  [ sec : coherent ] ) .",
    "observations of psr  j0205 + 6449  were made using the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board _ rxte_. the pca is an array of five collimated xenon / methane multi - anode proportional counter units ( pcus ) operating in the 2    60kev range , with a total effective area of approximately @xmath16 and a field of view of @xmath17  fwhm .",
    "data were obtained during _ rxte _  observing cycles 7 , 9 , and 10 , spanning a period of 4yr from mjd 52327 to 53813 , with a long gap ( from mjd 52752 to 53036 ) corresponding to _ rxte _  observing cycle 8 .",
    "in addition , four observations were taken in observing cycle 6 ( 17.1 hr exposure over mjd  52138  ",
    "because of the long data gap between the cycle 6 data and the subsequent observations in cycle 7 ( 202 days ) , they could not be unambiguously phase connected , rendering these observations of limited interest for our timing analysis .",
    "they were considered for a pulse profile analysis discussed in  [ sec : profile ] .",
    "the frequency for each cycle 6 observation was determined by a periodogram analysis , which was then used for folding the data .",
    "all of the _ rxte _   data were collected in `` goodxenon '' mode , which records the arrival time ( with 1-@xmath18s resolution ) and energy ( 256 channel resolution ) of every unrejected event .",
    "typically , 3 pcus were operational during an observation .",
    "for our timing analysis , we used only the first layer of each operational pcu in the energy range 2  ",
    "18kev , as this maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio of individual observations for this source .",
    "observations were downloaded from the heasarc archive and photon arrival times were converted to barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) at the solar system barycenter using the j2000 source position determined using data from _ cxo _ , ra = @xmath19  @xmath20@xmath21 , dec @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 @xcite and the jpl de200 solar system ephemeris with the fits tool ` faxbary ' .",
    "we noted that two observations directly following the leap second occurring on 2006 january 1 had incorrect clock corrections , confirmed by the _",
    "rxte _  team ( c. markwardt , private communication ) .",
    "this was fixed by adding a 1s time jump to each pulse time - of - arrival obtained from these observations .      the x - ray pulse profile as measured in each observing session by _",
    "rxte_has two narrow components separated by approximately one - half of a rotation of the pulsar ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gaussianprofile ] ) .",
    "such sharp pulse features are usually very helpful for timing analyses , however , the `` signal - to - noise '' ratio ( here defined as the ratio of pulsed source counts to all other counts ) for the _ rxte _",
    "observations was very low , with typical values near 6@xmath2510@xmath26 .",
    "these levels are so low that for some observations the pulses were not easily visible in the binned pulse profile plots .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the pulse times - of - arrival ( toas ) from the x - ray data , we used a new and simple maximum - likelihood ( ml ) technique .",
    "this method avoids the information loss inherent in binning event - based ( i.e. photon ) pulse profiles .",
    "the inputs to the method are an accurate model pulse profile @xmath27 of intensity , including both signal and the average noise level or background , as a function of rotational phase @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 ) , and the computed rotational phases @xmath30 of the @xmath31 events ( where @xmath32 ) from the observation according to the best timing model of the pulsar .",
    "we normalize @xmath27 so that it has unit area and can be treated as a probability density function for the individual event arrival times .",
    "if we assume an arrival offset @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the spin period ) of rotational phase ( where @xmath35 ) , we can compute a probability or likelihood that our data has that offset from the template using @xmath36 .",
    "if we compute a large grid of 1000 - 10000 evenly - spaced probabilities for offsets @xmath33 between 0 and 1 , the resulting distribution describes the probability density for the average pulse arrival time . when normalized , we can determine the most likely arrival time , or by suitably integrating the distribution , the median arrival time and error estimates for the arrival time .    to test",
    "how well the ml technique determines toas compared to the traditional binned fourier - based methods typically used in radio pulsar timing @xcite , we simulated @xmath2100,000 high - energy observations of pulsars with both a pulse profile like that of psr  j0205 + 6449  ( i.e. two narrow gaussian peaks separated by nearly half a rotation , fig .",
    "[ fig : gaussianprofile ] ) and a wide gaussian profile with fwhm@xmath370.2 , each with a wide variety of signal - to - noise ratios , total photon counts , and numbers of bins in the profiles used to measure the pulse phase for the traditional fourier method .",
    "the simulations showed that : 1 .",
    "the traditional fourier - based technique underestimated the toa errors by 10% to several hundred percent depending on the signal - to - noise ratio of the profiles as well as the number of bins used in the pulse profile .",
    "in contrast , the average errors estimated by the ml technique were almost always within 5% , and were typically within 1@xmath112% , of the true toa errors as determined from the statistics of the simulations .",
    "the measured toa error distributions were narrower for the ml technique than for the fourier technique ( i.e. the toas were more accurate ) by several percent typically , but by up to many tens of percent for low signal - to - noise ratio cases where the ratio of pulsed counts to background counts is below @xmath38 .",
    "3 . in very low signal - to - noise cases ( i.e. where the ratio of pulsed counts to background counts is @xmath39 ) , the fourier method determined completely wrong toas ( i.e. where the measured toa differed from the true toa by many times the estimated toa error ) much more often than the ml technique , typically by factors of 2 - 5 times .    in summary ,",
    "the ml technique determines slightly more accurate toas , with much better error estimates , over a wider range of signal - to - noise ratios , than the traditional binned fourier technique of toa determination .",
    "we recommend that it be used in all x - ray and @xmath4-ray pulsar timing applications , particularly in low signal - to - noise ratio situations .      for the ml - timing of psr  j0205 + 6449",
    ", we used a two - gaussian profile model or template @xmath27 based on a high signal - to - noise ratio pulse profile from four months of _ rxte _  data from early 2004 ( cycle 9 ) . the timing model used for",
    "the profile included several frequency derivatives such that no timing noise was apparent in the timing residuals .",
    "the two - gaussian plus dc component model was then fit to the data . the parameters of the resulting model are shown in table  [ table : templateprofile ] . the gaussian template with 1000 phase bins is shown in figure  [ fig : gaussianprofile ] .",
    "for each _ rxte _  observation , we folded the x - ray data using the best predicted spin period for that day with the software package presto @xcite , but we allowed the software to search in a narrow range for the best pulsation period .",
    "this technique was necessary to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio of the folded profiles because of the large levels of timing noise from the pulsar .",
    "we then used the refined spin period to determine pulse phases @xmath30 for each of the x - rays .    to determine the ml - derived toas , we used a grid of 1000 evenly spaced phase offsets @xmath33 over a full rotation of the pulsar . while this is a fairly computationally expensive task when the number of events is large ( as is the case for _ rxte _  with its high background rate ) , the resulting likelihood distribution was typically well behaved ( i.e. unimodal and nearly symmetric ) and produced excellent toas and error estimates .",
    "typical uncertainties were between 450@xmath11750@xmath18s for each toa .",
    "the phase offset , as determined by the median of the resulting likelihood distribution , was multiplied by the current pulse period and added to the fiducial epoch for each observation , in our case the first x - ray recorded , to make a toa .",
    "approximate one - sigma error estimates for each toa were determined by integrating the likelihood distribution in each direction until 0.8413 of the total likelihood was accounted for . for each",
    "_ rxte _  observation , we typically determined 2@xmath113 toas .",
    "the resulting toas were fitted to a timing model ( see  3.1 and  3.2 ) using the pulsar timing software package tempo .      observations with the gbt were made at either 820 or 1400mhz from mjd  52327    52776 using the berkeley - caltech pulsar machine ( bcpm * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the bcpm is an analog / digital filterbank which samples each of 2@xmath2596 channels using 4 bits at flexible sampling rates and channel bandwidths .",
    "we recorded data using 134mhz of bandwidth and 50@xmath18s samples for the 1400mhz observations or 48mhz of bandwidth and 72@xmath18s samples for the 820mhz observations .",
    "typical integrations times lasted between 3@xmath115hrs .",
    "we de - dispersed at the known dispersion measure ( dm ) of 140.7@xmath400.3pccm@xmath26 @xcite and folded all of the data using presto @xcite , and then extracted 2@xmath113 toas per observation by correlating in the frequency domain the folded 64-bin pulse profile with a gaussian of fractional width 0.04 in phase .",
    "the typical precision of the toas was 200@xmath11400@xmath18s .",
    "toas were corrected to the utc timescale using data from global positioning system ( gps ) satellites .",
    "observations were made at jbo every 3@xmath115 days between mjd  53725 and 54666 using the 76-m lovell telescope of the university of manchester at a frequency of 1.4ghz .",
    "each observation typically lasted 3hr , divided into 1-minute sub - integrations .",
    "the data were de - dispersed at the known dm in hardware and folded on - line .",
    "the profiles from these , sampled in intervals of 164.3@xmath18s , were added in polarization pairs and then combined to provide a single total - intensity profile .",
    "this was then convolved with a template derived from a single high signal - to - noise - ratio 400-bin profile at the same frequency to yield a toa .",
    "toas were corrected to utc using information from the gps .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the typical precision of the toas was 200@xmath11700@xmath18s .",
    "the most accurate method used to determine spin parameters is phase - coherent timing , that is comparing toas with a model ephemeris and accounting for each rotation of the pulsar , as described elsewhere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a single phase - coherent timing solution spanning all 6.4yr of data proved impossible for these data owing to the 287-day gap in timing observations as well as two large glitches . as such",
    ", we present three coherent timing solutions , summarized in table  [ table : parameters ] .",

    "phase coherence was lost after mjd  52538 , as the result of a glitch ( see  [ sec : glitches ] ) . a second coherent timing solution using gbt and _ rxte _  data spans seven months ( mjd  52571  ",
    "timing residuals are shown in figure  [ fig : c7_postglitch ] , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath43 fitted in the top panel .",
    "as with the previous timing solution , significant timing noise remains in the residuals , which is fitted with 5 frequency derivatives , shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : c7_postglitch ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cycle9_10_jb ] shows residuals for the third timing solution spanning @xmath24.4yr ( mjd  53063  ",
    "in addition to two years of x - ray timing observations ( spanning mjd  53063  ",
    "53813 ) , on mjd  52725 ( 2005 december 21 ) , radio timing observations began using jbo .",
    "x - ray and radio observations were concurrent for 88 days , after which no additional x - ray observations were obtained .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : cycle9_10_jb ] shows residuals with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath43 removed ; the bottom panel shows residuals with 12 frequency derivatives fitted .",
    "the timing noise in this 4.4-yr period is so large that it can not be fully described by a 12 degree polynomial ( the largest allowed with current machine precision ) .",
    "in addition , some of the timing noise seen in these data is likely attributable to unmodeled glitch recovery @xcite .",
    "in fact , the measured value of @xmath8 is significantly different from that predicted from the previous timing solution .",
    "the difference between the predicted and measured @xmath8 is too large ( @xmath26@xmath44hz ) to be explained by timing noise , indicating that a glitch probably occurred during the 287-day gap in the data .      in general ,",

    ", we performed a partially coherent timing analysis over short time intervals ( on average @xmath240days ) , fitting only for @xmath8 and @xmath9 and choosing the length of each data subset such that the phase residuals are gaussian - distributed ( i.e. ` white ' ) .",
    "the results , with the average @xmath9 from the inter - glitch period removed , are shown plotted in the top panel of figure  [ fig : partial_nu ] .",
    "two glitches as well as timing noise are clearly present .",
    "we also show measurements of @xmath9 for the same intervals in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : partial_nu ] .",
    "again , two glitches are apparent , as is the significant timing noise in the data .    to measure accurately the size of each glitch while minimizing the contaminating effect of long - term timing noise , we took @xmath8 measurements spanning only @xmath2200 days before and after each glitch to measure the fractional increase in spin frequency .",
    "figures  [ fig : cycle7_glitch ] and [ fig : cycle8_glitch ] show pre- and post - glitch @xmath8 measurements with the post - glitch slope subtracted .",
    "we observed a frequency increase between mjds  52538 and 52571 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cycle7_glitch ] ) , corresponding to the loss of phase coherence discussed in  [ sec : coherent ] .",
    "this @xmath8 increase corresponds to a glitch of fractional magnitude @xmath51 ( see also ransom et al .",
    "the change in @xmath52 over the glitch is not statistically significant when measured as the slope of frequency measurements , as shown in the figure .",
    "however , the fractional change in @xmath9 from the individual @xmath9 measurements before and after the glitch is significant , with @xmath53 . no short - term post - glitch relaxation is detected ; however , because of the sparse sampling , it can not be precluded .",
    "neither can a long - term post - glitch relaxation be distinguished from a simple change in @xmath54 because a decay , if present , was interrupted by a second glitch .",
    "we observed a second frequency increase between mjds  52776 and 53063 as shown in figure  [ fig : cycle8_glitch ] . because no timing data were taken during the 287-day period where the frequency jump occurred",
    ", it is not possible to differentiate between a single glitch and two ( or more ) smaller glitches .",
    "however , because there is no clear evidence of more than one glitch , we interpret the frequency increase as a single glitch of fractional magnitude @xmath55 .",
    "the frequency derivative , as measured from the slope before and after the glitch ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cycle8_glitch ] ) also changed significantly , with a fractional magnitude of @xmath56 .",
    "another possible description of this glitch is a large increase in @xmath8 followed by an exponential recovery ( also suggested for this glitch by w. hermsen , personal communication ) .",
    "fitting a glitch model including an exponential decay to all the frequency measurements before and after the glitch , we found models which span a wide range of possible glitch parameters , with a reduced @xmath57 of @xmath58 for 25 degrees of freedom .",
    "we found fits of roughly equal probability for all possible glitch epochs between the two bounding coherent timing solutions , thus we present a range of glitch parameters corresponding to the date limits of mjd 52777 and mjd 53062 .",
    "a typical fit and residuals are shown in figure  [ fig : glitchresids ] .",
    "the fractional magnitude of the glitch from these models ranges from @xmath59 , while the recovery fraction spans @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the long - term change in frequency derivative , @xmath62 , is always negative , i.e. in the opposite direction from that expected in a typical glitch , and is approximately equal to @xmath2@xmath63 for all fitted models .",
    "this could be attributed to unusual glitch recovery , timing noise , or a combination thereof .",
    "however , this effect is possibly an artifact of the fitting procedure , where it is assumed that the pre - glitch @xmath8 is not itself recovering from the previous glitch .",
    "because of the unusual behavior of the long - term @xmath64 after the glitch , and the possibility that this behavior is not a direct result of the glitch , we performed a third fit to the frequency data , this time excluding frequency measurements after mjd 53700 ( after which the unusual @xmath64 dominates ) , and fixing the change in @xmath54 to be zero .",
    "fitting an exponential glitch recovery model to this subset of data provides a much better fit , as shown for a sample glitch epoch in figure  [ fig : shortglitch ] .",
    "again , the glitch may have occurred at any time between mjd 52777 and 53062 .",
    "for this fit , the range of possible fractional increases in frequency is @xmath65 , while the recovery fraction is @xmath66 and the recovery time scale is @xmath67days .",
    "for each _ rxte _  observation in observing cycles 7 , 9 , and 10 , we created a phase - resolved spectrum with 64 phase bins across the profile , using the ftool ` fasebin ' and the partially coherent timing ephemerides described above (  [ sec : glitches ] ) .",

    "we selected photons from all three layers of the xenon detectors , and from all operational pcus and included all photons within the energy range 2    60kev .",
    "in addition , we repeated the entire process using the first xenon layer for the energy range 2    18kev , where the majority of the softer source counts reside .",
    "we also created phase - averaged spectra which were used to build response matrices for each pcu .",
    "we then used xspec to create a pulse profile in count rate for each pcu for each observation .",
    "we then combined data from all pcus for each observation , dividing by a factor to account for the amount of time each pcu was on , resulting in a pulse profile in units of count rate per pcu .",
    "we aligned the 2    18kev profile for each observation by cross - correlating with the 2-gaussian template ( fig .",

    "  40kev and summed profiles from _ rxte _  cycles 7 , 9 , and 10 ( where phase - coherent timing solutions exist ) into a single profile for each energy band , shown in figure  [ fig : energyevolution ] .",
    "we used the phase offset determined from cross correlating the 2    18kev profile to align the profiles from all the energy ranges .",
    "this ensures that the correct phase offset is applied the 18    40kev profiles , where the signal - to - noise ratio of individual profiles is very poor , and a noise spike can be mistaken by the cross correlation algorithm for the sharp peak of the profile .",
    "we note that using the phase offset determined for a different energy range profile could be problematic in building added profiles if there is signifcant energy evolution across the energy range of interest .",
    "this does not appear to be the case for this pulsar for the relevant energy range .",
    "the pulsar is visible up to @xmath71kev and the pulse shape does not vary significantly with increasing energy .",
    "there is some possible unusual structure in the off - pulse region of the profiles , particularly for the energy range 18  ",
    "we examined this putative structure by performing several additional analyses .",
    "first , we produced summed profiles using a different method than described above .",
    "we extracted events and created a time series for each energy range , for each individual observation .",
    "we folded each time series with the local ephemeris and aligned and summed the profiles several times using different template profiles .",
    "this analysis produced pulse profiles that are not significantly different from those shown in figure  [ fig : energyevolution ] .",
    "we further analyzed the off - pulse region of the profiles by applying a @xmath72 test , a @xmath73 test @xcite , and an @xmath74 test @xcite .",
    "the reduced @xmath72 values for the 10    18kev and 18  ",
    "40kev are less than 1 , while the @xmath72 for the off - pulse region of the 2  ",
    "10kev profile is 55 for 48 degrees of freedom ( where the probability of this @xmath72 or higer occurring by chance is 21% ) . the @xmath73 test for 1 ,",
    "2 , 4 , and 8 harmonics , and the @xmath74 test applied to the off - pulse region of all three profiles resulted in the null hypothesis . therefore , the off - pulse regions of the profiles are not statistically different from a dc offset .",
    "precise measurement of the phase lag between the radio and x - ray pulses is important for understanding the pulse emission mechanism .",
    "emission from rotation - powered pulsars is thought to arise from either a polar cap ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or in magnetospheric outer gaps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "absolute timing for several different energy ranges can place constraints on the shape of the outer gap and the height in the magnetosphere where radiation is generated @xcite .",
    "the radio pulse profile of psr  j0205 + 6449  is single peaked with a width of @xmath2@xmath75 @xcite ; the x - ray profile is double peaked , with a peak - to - peak separation of @xmath20.5 .",
    "we made two independent measurements of the phase offset between the radio pulse and the main x - ray pulse for psr  j0205 + 6449 , by finding the offset between the gbt and _ rxte _  data , and the jbo and _ rxte _  data .",
    "we used the first timing solution ( gbt and _ rxte _  data prior to glitch 1 ) spanning mjds  52327 to 52538 to make three independent measurements of the phase offset .",
    "we split our timing solution into three subsets , fitting only for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "radio toas were shifted to infinite frequency using the nominal dm @xcite .",
    "the data subsets were chosen such that there was good overlap between the sparsely sampled x - ray and radio data , and that each solution had gaussian - distributed residuals .",
    "the weighted average value of these three measurements is @xmath76ms , or @xmath77 in phase ( radio leading ) .",
    "this analysis could not be repeated for the post - glitch gbt/_rxte _  timing solution because of the even more sparsely sampled data , which consist of significant lags between most radio and x - ray observations , leading to poorly constrained values of the phase offset for short sections of the data .",
    "we obtained a second measurement of the phase offset by simultaneously fitting overlapping timing observations from _ rxte _  and jbo , spanning 88 days from mjds  53725 to 53813 .",
    "we first obtained a phase - coherent timing solution from the well sampled radio data , and then added the overlapping , more sparsely sampled x - ray toas .",
    "again , radio toas were shifted to infinite frequency using the nominal dm value .",
    "we split the data into three subsets , fitting only for @xmath8 and @xmath9 and ensuring that each subset had gaussian residuals .",
    "the jbo toas were created using a different fiducial point than the gbt and _ rxte _",
    "profiles , so each toa was shifted by a constant to adjust for the difference between the two fiducial points used .",
    "the weighted average of these offset measurements is @xmath78ms , corresponding to a phase offset of @xmath79 .",
    "the difference between this measurement and that made with _",
    "rxte _  and gbt data is @xmath80ms , i.e. , in agreement within @xmath81 .",
    "we further verified the phase offset by extracting a single toa from an archival _ cxo _ observation from february 2002 ( observation i d 2756 ) .",
    "the offset measured from the _ cxo _ toa to the gbt radio toas agrees with our gbt/_rxte _",
    "offset within 1.2@xmath42 .",
    "the uncertainty in the phase offset is dominated by the uncertainty in the dm .",
    "the dm was measured to be 140.7@xmath400.3pccm@xmath26 using 800 and 1375mhz gbt data in 2002 , as reported in @xcite .",
    "thus the jbo determination of the phase lag , made @xmath23.5yr after the measurement of dm , could be affected by short or long - term changes in dm .",
    "we therefore report the first measurement of the phase offset made with gbt and _ rxte _ , of @xmath82 .",
    "we show evidence for two large glitches in 6.4yr of timing data of psr  j0205 + 6449 .",
    "the fractional magnitudes of these glitches ( @xmath83 ) are typical of pulsars with characteristic ages of 5@xmath1110kyr , such as the frequent large glitcher psr j0537@xmath116910 ( @xmath84kyr ) or the vela pulsar ( @xmath85kyr ) .",
    "the youngest pulsars such as the crab pulsar ( 955yr ) , psr b0540@xmath1169 ( @xmath86kyr ) and psr j1119@xmath116127 ( @xmath87kyr ) typically have glitches with smaller fractional magnitudes ranging from @xmath88 .",
    "perhaps this indicates that the pulsar age is closer to its characteristic age of @xmath89kyr , rather than the historical supernova age of 828yr .",
    "if the pulsar was born in the historical supernova event 828yr ago , these glitches are unusually large . glitches may be related to pulsar age via neutron star temperature @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the large glitches observed here could be related to the very low measured temperature of psr  j0205 + 6449  @xcite , rather than its chronological age .",
    "the reason for the exceptionally cool surface temperature of this neutron star is still a mystery , though may be explained with a large neutron star mass @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "large glitches have been observed in the hot surface temperature anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if the mechanism behind rotation - powered pulsar and magnetar glitches is similar , the neutron star surface temperature may not be the primary factor in determining the size of glitches .",
    "young pulsars emit large amounts of energy as they spin down , providing for easy measurement of @xmath9 , and occasionally higher order frequency derivatives ( @xmath43 , @xmath90 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a measurement of @xmath43 provides an estimate of the ` braking ' index , @xmath91 , giving insight into the physics underlying pulsar spin - down , as well as an improved estimate of the pulsar age .",
    "both timing noise and glitches can prevent a measurement of @xmath92 .",
    "generally , only the youngest pulsars , with @xmath93kyr , have measurable braking indices .",
    "the exception is the 11kyr - old vela pulsar , where frequent large glitches prevent a phase - coherent measurement of the braking index , but measuring @xmath9 in the aftermath of glitches has allowed a measurement of @xmath94 over @xmath225yrs of data @xcite .",
    "the initial goal of timing psr  j0205 + 6449  was to measure its braking index .",
    "however , the measured value of @xmath92 varies significantly among the three phase - coherent timing solutions obtained for this source , ranging from @xmath95 . a partially coherent timing analysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : partial_nu ] ) shows that @xmath9 does not evolve linearly implying that a deterministic value of @xmath43 and thus @xmath92 can not be measured from these data .",
    "however , excluding data in the immediate aftermath of the glitches and looking at the overall trend in @xmath9 from the first three and last 10 measurements of @xmath9 from figure  [ fig : partial_nu ] ( bottom panel ) , the implied value is @xmath96 .",
    "though this value is contaminated by timing noise and glitch recovery , it is suggestive that the true , underlying value of @xmath92 may eventually be measurable with long - term timing .",
    "the observed phase difference between radio and high - energy pulses , as well as the pulse shape and peak - to - peak separation , in principal provide important information about the pulsar emission mechanism by constraining the pulse emission region .",
    "table  [ offset_table ] shows the offsets between the radio and x - ray pulses and the radio and @xmath4-ray pulses for all known measurements to date .",
    "these compiled data show that there is a large scatter in the measured offsets and no correlation between pulse period and phase offset .",
    "the measured offset for psr  j0205 + 6449  of @xmath3 supports the lack of correlation between phase offset and pulse period .",
    "in particular , psr  j0205 + 6449  has a very similar pulse period ( 65.7ms ) to the pulsar psr  j1420@xmath116048 ( 68.2ms ) , while the phase offset of psr  j1420@xmath116048 is @xmath97 @xcite . it is likely that the geometry and viewing angle of each system will affect the measured phase offset and may ultimately explain the range of observed offsets .",
    "the radio - to - x - ray phase offset for psr  j0205 + 6449  is consistent with the radio - to-@xmath4-ray offset of @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray and @xmath4-ray phase offsets are likewise aligned for the crab @xcite and vela pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while this is not the case for the young pulsar psr  b1509@xmath1158 @xcite , nor the millisecond pulsar psr  j0218 + 4232 @xcite .",
    "the outer gap model of @xcite predicts that the x - ray pulse should lag the radio pulse by 0.35@xmath110.5 in phase and should appear as a single broad pulse .",
    "neither prediction is supported by the x - ray profile of psr  j0205 + 6449 .",
    "in addition , a thermal x - ray pulse arriving in phase with the radio pulse is predicted , while no thermal pulsations have been detected in psr  j0205 + 6449  @xcite .",
    "the main pulse of psr  j0205 + 6449  is detected up to 40kev with the pca on board _ rxte _ , while the interpulse is visible up to @xmath218kev .",
    "it is one of an increasing number of young pulsars detected in the hard x - ray energy range and has also recently been detected up to @xmath99gev with the _ fermi space telescope _",
    "@xcite . comparing the emission of the crab pulsar and nebula to the 3c 58 pulsar and nebula at higher energies may offer insight into the physical reasons behind the intriguing differences between these two seemingly similar objects .",
    "multi - wavelength timing observations offer an excellent probe of both the temporal and emission characteristics of young pulsars .",
    "we observed two large glitches that are not characteristic of the proposed young age of psr  j0205 + 6449 .",
    "this is not conclusive however , and the timing data are consistent with an age of 828yr if the pulsar was born spinning slowly with @xmath100ms , or an age of @xmath101kyr if the pulsar was born spinning rapidly .",
    "furthermore , the age of the pulsar is consistent with @xmath102kyr if its true braking index @xmath103 , as is the case for all measured values of @xmath92 , though there is currently no evidence for @xmath103 for psr  j0205 + 6449 .",
    "long - term timing may eventually allow for the measurement of @xmath92 by using the incoherent method performed on the vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "we have presented the first measurement of the phase offset between the radio and x - ray pulses of psr  j0205 + 6449  to be @xmath104 , which is consistent with the recently reported @xmath4-ray phase offset of @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "psr  j0205 + 6449  is rare in that it has both the magnetospheric x - ray and @xmath4-ray phase offset precisely measured . among the pulsars with measured phase offsets , with periods ranging from 1.56ms to 1250ms",
    ", there is no correlation between pulse period and phase offset , as shown in table  [ offset_table ] .",
    "phase offset measurements should be important for constraining the pulse emission region and significant progress is occurring at present in the measurement of radio - to-@xmath4-ray phase offsets with the ongoing detection of many radio pulsars as @xmath4-ray pulsars with _ fermi_.    we would like to thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions that greatly impoved our manuscript .",
