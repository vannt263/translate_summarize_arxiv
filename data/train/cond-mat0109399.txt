    "critical universality is an attractive feature in statistical physics because wide range of models can be classified purely in terms of their collective behavior into classes . while in equilibrium systems",
    "the factors determining these classes are quite well understood , in nonequilibrium systems the situation is less clear .",
    "the 1 + 1 dimensional reaction - diffusion systems are important for the understanding of the universality classes of non - equilibrium system because order - disorder phase transitions may occur in such a low dimension unlike in equilibrium systems @xcite",
    ". however , for the ordered state to be stable it must exhibit only small fluctuations .",
    "all of this kind of transitions are such that the ordered state is `` absorbing '' , i.e. when the system falls into it , it can not escape .",
    "in fact for a long time only such phase transitions have been known where the absorbing state is completely frozen .",
    "a few universality classes of this kind are known @xcite,@xcite , the most prominent and the first one that was discovered is that of the directed percolation ( dp)@xcite . an early hypothesis @xcite was confirmed by all examples up to now .",
    "this claims that in one component systems exhibiting continuous phase transitions to single absorbing states ( without extra symmetry , inhomogeneity or disorder ) short ranged interactions can generate dp class transition only .",
    "the lagragian of the field theory of the dp process @xmath0 exhibits a time reversal symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "this results in relations among scaling exponents ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the same static scaling behavior was observed in frozen multi - absorbing state systems as well , like in the pair contact process ( pcp ) @xcite . here",
    "the time reversal symmetry is broken owing to an extra term in the lagrangian describing the effect of frozen particles generating long time memory in the system @xcite .",
    "besides dp a few more universality classes have been established in the last decade . in models exhibiting particle annihilation fluctuating absorbing states with a single wandering particle",
    "can occur @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab ] we have tried to summarize the most well known absorbing state phase transition classes of disorder - free , homogeneous models with short range interactions .",
    "those , which are below the horizontal line exhibit fluctuating absorbing states . for more details of field theoretical symmetries and their relation to hyperscaling laws see @xcite .",
    ".summary of known 1 + 1 d universality classes .",
    "dcf , ndcf denote models with coupled ( non)diffusive conserved fields . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      hard - core interactions in the two - component , one - offspring production model ( 2-barw1 ) were investigated in @xcite . without interaction between different species",
    "one would expect dp class transition . by introducing an @xmath2 blocking in the @xmath3 model a dp class transition at @xmath4 was been found indeed . on the other hand",
    "if we couple the two sub - systems by the production @xmath5 without exclusion bosonic field theory @xcite predicts unidirectionally coupled dp class @xcite transitions . with hard - core exclusion a continuous phase transition will emerge at rate @xmath6  therefore the on - critical exponents will be the same as described in sect .",
    "( [ 2 ] )  and the order parameter exponent was found to be @xmath7 .",
    "this assures that this transition belongs to the same class as that of the 2-barw2s model .",
    "the parity conservation law that is relevant in case of one component systems ( pc versus dp class ) is irrelevant here .",
    "this finding reduces the expectations for a whole new series of universality classes in 1d systems with exclusions .",
    "in fact the blockades introduced by exclusions generate robust classes . in @xcite",
    "a hypothesis was set up that in coupled branching and annihilating random walk systems of n - types of excluding particles for continuous transitions at @xmath6 two universality classes exist , those of 2-barw2s and 2-barw2a , depending on whether the reactants can immediately annihilate ( i.e. when similar particles are not separated by other type(s ) of particle(s ) ) or not .",
    "recent investigations in similar models @xcite are in agreement with this hypothesis and the extension to binary spreading processes was proposed in @xcite .",
    "we have shown how blockades generated by particle exclusion in some one - dimensional reaction - diffusion type systems affect critical scaling behavior .    we confirmed by bosonic simulations that the single component unary barw1 and barw2 processes exhibit the same dynamical scaling as the corresponding models with exclusion . in case of the one component binary spreading process",
    "the bosonic and fermionic versions differ . while the former one has a discontinuous phase transition the latter exhibits a continuous transition .",
    "we determined numerically the dynamic scaling behavior of the bosonic version .    without particle production initial condition dependent dynamical scaling",
    "was found in multicomponent arw models .",
    "this critical behavior was shown to give the set of on - critical exponents if we generate phase transition by particle branching since the transitions occur at the @xmath6 rate .",
    "the off - critical exponents were found to be insensitive to parity conservation law and depend only on the spatial arrangement of parent and offspring .",
    "two generic universality classes : 2-barw2a and 2-barw2s were explored by numerical simulations . in these models",
    "the hard - core exclusions generate extra fluctuations in the absorbing state and the passive steady states posses long - range correlations .",
