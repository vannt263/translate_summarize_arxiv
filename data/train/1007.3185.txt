    "although the standard model ( sm ) provides us an almost complete theory of electro - weak interactions , its mechanism of spontaneous breakdown of symmetry is still not well understood .",
    "higgs , the center pillar of sm , has not been discovered yet .",
    "it is most likely that the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will discover the sm higgs .",
    "however , many alternative scenarios beyond sm offer solutions to electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) by incorporating more than one higgs boson . therefore",
    ", it is essential to carry out a thorough study of the properties of the higgs , which is extremely difficult task at lhc .",
    "however , these precision tests can be meticulously performed at an @xmath4 linear collider .",
    "the international linear collider ( ilc ) , which is at the design stage and likely to become a reality @xcite , is definitely the well suited for this purpose . at the lowest order in sm",
    "the @xmath0 vertex is simply point - like whereas the @xmath1 vertex vanishes .",
    "interactions beyond sm can modify this vertex by means of a momentum - dependent form factor , as well as by adding more complicated momentum - dependent forms of anomalous interactions considered in @xcite .",
    "demanding lorentz invariance , the most general coupling structure of @xmath5 vertex may be expressed as : @xmath6   \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the momenta of the intermediate vector boson , @xmath9 or @xmath10 and outgoing vector boson @xmath10 respectively and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in general complex , are form factors .    here",
    "we consider in a general model - independent way the production of a higgs mass eigenstate @xmath14 through the process @xmath15 mediated by @xmath16-channel virtual @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we have studied how beam polarization ( both transverse and longitudinal ) can be used to constrain anomalous interactions of the higgs with neutral electroweak bosons .",
    "there have been various recent works on the study of anomalous @xmath17 couplings at a linear collider @xcite",
    ". however , our approach is different from theirs in that we include @xmath1 coupling , study the effects of both longitudinal as well as transverse @xmath18 and @xmath19 beams and construct simple asymmetries and correlations based on the @xmath20 and @xmath21 transformation properties @xcite .",
    "polarized beams are likely to be available at ilc , and several studies have shown the importance of longitudinal polarization in reducing backgrounds and improving the sensitivity of new effects . with longitudinal polarization ,",
    "the cross section for @xmath4 annihilation is given by @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the `` effective polarization '' , @xmath24 is the unpolarized cross section , @xmath25 is the cross section with left helicity @xmath19 and right helicty @xmath18 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are degrees of longitudinal polarization of the @xmath19 and @xmath18 beams respectively . with opposite signs of beam polarization for @xmath18 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the factors @xmath28 and ( @xmath29 ) are large and hence the corresponding total cross section is enhanced . since polarized beams may not be available for the full period of operation of the collider , we consider alternative options of integrated luminosities for individual combinations of polarization .",
    "we assume three runs of the collider with three different combinations : a ) unpolarized beams , b ) same signs of beam polarization , and c ) opposite signs of beam polarization for @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "half of the integrated luminosity is assumed for the run a ) with unpolarized beams and other half to be equally divided between the other two runs b ) and c ) .",
    "we calculate the angular distribution arising from the square of the sm amplitude and from the interference between the sm amplitude and the amplitude arising from the anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings while ignoring terms bilinear in anomalous couplings assuming new physics contributions to be small .",
    "we have treated the two cases of longitudinal and transverse polarizations for the electron and positron beams separately . in all these cases ,",
    "we have calculated traces using the symbolic manipulation program ` * * form * * ' @xcite .    *",
    "a. angular distributions for longitudinally polarized beams *    the angular distribution for the process @xmath30 with longitudinal beam polarization and including anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 contributions may be written as @xmath31\\ ] ] apart from kinematic factors , the dependence of the coefficients @xmath32 s , @xmath33 s , etc on anomalous couplings and vector and axial couplings @xmath34 and @xmath35 is shown in table [ tab : coeff ] .",
    ".[tab : coeff]dependence of coefficients @xmath32s,@xmath33 s etc on vector and axial vector couplings and the anomalous couplings associated with them . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have obtained angular distributions for the process @xmath36 in the presence of anomalous @xmath1 and @xmath0 couplings to linear order in these couplings in the presence of longitudinal and transverse beam polarizations .",
    "we have then looked at observables and asymmetries which can be used in combinations to disentangle the various couplings to the extent possible .",
    "we have also obtained the sensitivities of these observables and asymmetries to the various couplings for a definite configuration of the linear collider .    in some cases , the contribution of some couplings is suppressed due to the vector coupling of @xmath10 to @xmath4 being very small . in those cases",
    "longitudinal polarization helps to enhance the contribution of these couplings and thereby improving the sensitivity .",
    "we find that with a linear collider operating at a c.m .",
    "energy of 500 gev with the capability of 80% electron polarization and 60% positron polarization with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath37 , with the observables described above , it would be possible to place 95% cl individual limits of the order of a few times @xmath38 on all couplings taken nonzero one at a time with use of an appropriate combination ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 of opposite signs ) of longitudinal beam polarizations .",
    "this is an improvement by a factor of 5 to 10 as compared to the unpolarized case .",
    "the simultaneous limits possible are , as expected , less stringent . while they continue to be better than @xmath41 for most couplings .",
    "transverse polarization enables the determination of @xmath42 independent of all other couplings . also , in the angular distribution of @xmath10 , all @xmath21 odd anomalous couplings @xmath43 ,",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are absent , and therefore , inorder to probe these couplings , we need to construct @xmath21-odd observables which involve vector triple products . for this , we study the decay of the @xmath10 boson to a charged lepton pair and construct various @xmath21-odd observables using the momenta of the leptons coming from @xmath10 decay . with @xmath21-odd observables",
    ", we could probe all the anomalous couplings which are earlier absent .",
    "we have assumed that only one leptonic decay mode of @xmath10 is observed . including both @xmath48 and @xmath49 modes",
    "would trivially improve the sensitivity . in case of observables like @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , which do not need charge identification , even hadronic decay modes of @xmath10",
