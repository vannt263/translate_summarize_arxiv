    "this non - sequential double recombination ( nsdr ) process has a distinctive contribution to the hhg signal as a new plateau in the hhg spectrum that emerges at higher photon energies with multiple new cutoffs",
    ". the original work on nsdr hhg @xcite found that for the atomic system electrons returning to emit nsdr hhg had to be emitted in different half periods of the external field as electrons emitted in the same half period would have to propagate the same path to return at the same time , a process which is strongly suppressed by electron - electron repulsion .",
    "later work found that for molecules the possibility for emission of electrons from the different nuclei at large internuclear distances reduced the effect of the electron - electron repulsion allowing for same - period emission and recombination ( spear ) of the electrons creating a new cutoff in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "it was also found that the strong correlation of the electrons in the process lead to spear nsdr hhg being dependent on the internuclear distance because of an interaction with nuclei when the electrons propagated in the field .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of the nsdr hhg signal and generalize the findings found for spear nsdr to the general case of nsdr hhg in atomic or molecular systems and formulate a coulomb corrected three - step model ( cc - tsm ) for two electrons and one or more nuclei .",

    "the three - step model fails to predict the observed cutoffs while the cc - tsm shows the dynamical change in the cutoff for the molecular system as the internuclear distance grows .",

    "<S> we present a study of non - sequential double recombination ( nsdr ) high harmonic generation ( hhg ) in a molecular - like system . </S>",
    "<S> using a coulomb - corrected three - step model we are able to classically describe the observed nsdr hhg cutoffs precisely for all internuclear distances showing an intrinsic dependence on the location of the nuclei in the nsdr hhg process originating partly from the strong electron correlation in the nsdr hhg process . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence modifies the classically allowed return energies which in return changes the cutoffs observed in the hhg spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that the nsdr hhg signal changes its character for internuclear distances of @xmath0 a.u . which is proposed to stem from a change in the charge transfer dynamics within the molecule . for large internuclear distances of @xmath1 a.u . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a clear signature of the point of emission for the first electron emitted in the nsdr hhg signal and we also see signs of molecular exchange paths contributing to the hhg spectrum for these internuclear distances . </S>"
