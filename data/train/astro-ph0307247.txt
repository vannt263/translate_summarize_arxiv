    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are believed to drive the tremendous energy output of quasars , and more generally , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "recent studies have shown that the centers of all massive galaxies today harbor smbhs ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; ferrarese & merritt 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , the mass of the black hole scales directly with the mass of the host galaxy , or more specifically , the mass of the host galaxy s bulge or spheroidal component .",
    "the early results were based on a correlation between smbh mass and bulge luminosity , @xmath3 ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; laor 1998 ; wandel 1999 ) , which showed a large scatter , as much as two orders of magnitude in smbh mass ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "subsequent studies focused on the relationship between the masses of smbhs and the velocity dispersions , @xmath4 , of their host bulges or spheroids .",
    "this relation shows considerably less scatter than the @xmath5 relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; tremaine et al .",
    "there is also no significant difference between the relationships measured for active and quiescent galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000b ; ferrarese et al .",
    "recently , smbh mass has also been shown to correlate strongly with the global structure of ellipticals and bulges ( e.g. more centrally concentrated bulges have more massive smbhs ) .",
    "this relationship is as strong as the @xmath6 relationship with comparable scatter ( graham et al .",
    "2001 ; erwin et al .",
    "studies that carefully model the bulge light profiles of disk galaxies and thereby obtain more accurate values of @xmath3 also show less scatter in @xmath5 , similar to that in the @xmath7 relationship ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ; erwin et al .",
    "2002 ; bettoni et al .",
    "2003 ) .    the overall mass of a galaxy is also known to correlate with its metallicity ( faber 1973 ; zaritsky et al . 1994 ; jablonka et al .",
    "1996 ; trager et al .",
    "this relationship is generally understood in terms of the gravitational binding energy .",
    "more massive galaxies have deeper potential wells , making it harder for supernovae and stellar winds to blow matter out of the region .",
    "therefore , the gas remains in the galaxy longer , where it is further reprocessed by stars , leading to higher metallicities .",
    "this mass - metallicity relationship , combined with the relationship between smbh mass and galaxy mass , suggests that there should be a relationship between smbh mass and the metallicity of the gas clouds surrounding quasars ( hamann & ferland 1993 ) .",
    "the metallicity of the gas in the broad emission line region ( blr ) of quasars can be estimated by analyzing prominent emission lines .",
    "blr metallicities should be representative of the gas in the central regions of galaxies if the blr was enriched by stars in those environments .",
    "previous studies have demonstrated that we can not simply examine ratios of strong metal to hydrogen lines , such as @xmath0 / , to measure the c / h abundance .",
    "this is because strong collisionally excited lines like play an important role in cooling the gas .",
    "increasing the metallicity and thus c / h leads to lower gas temperatures and an almost constant /  ratio ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "the best abundance diagnostics for the blr involve ratios of lines that are i ) not important in the cooling , and ii ) have similar excitation / emission requirements ( hamann et al .",
    "2002 ) . ratios of emission lines involving nitrogen , n , are especially valuable in determining the metallicity , @xmath8 , because of the expected  secondary \" n production via the cno cycle of nucleosynthesis in stars ( shields 1976 ; hamann & ferland 1992 , 1993 , 1999 ; ferland et al .",
    "1996 ; hamann et al . 2002 ) . in the cno cycle",
    ", nitrogen is produced from existing carbon and oxygen .",
    "the nitrogen abundance should therefore scale roughly as n / h @xmath9 or n / o @xmath10 o / h @xmath11 ( tinsley 1980 ) , providing a sensitive metallicity diagnostic even when direct measures of @xmath8 = o / h are not available . observations of regions indicate that secondary nitrogen production and n / o @xmath10 o / h scaling dominate for @xmath12 @xmath13 ( van zee et al .",
    "1998 ; pettini et al . 2002 ) .",
    "some other studies suggest that there can be significant departures from the simple n / o @xmath10 o / h relationship owing to time - dependent or perhaps metallicity - dependent yields of n , o , and c ( eg .",
    "henry et al .",
    "these effects are often invoked to explain the observed object - to - object scatter in n / o versus o / h .",
    "however , there is a general consensus that large ( solar or higher ) n / o ratios indicate large ( solar or higher ) metallicities .",
    "moreover , the most homogeneous and therefore most reliable region data ( pilyugin et al . 2002 ; pettini et al .",
    "2002 ) indicate that the scatter in n / o decreases and the validity of n / o @xmath10 o / h improves in the regime of roughly solar or higher metallicities .",
    "this is the regime of the gas near quasars , based on studies of both their broad emission and intrinsic narrow absorption lines ( constantin et al .",

    ", we simply assume that n / o @xmath10 o / h applies .",
    "we also note that our analysis of composite quasar spectra naturally averages over object - to - object variations .",
    "any metallicity trends that we infer from the emission line ratios depend on this assumption of n / o @xmath10 o / h in addition to measurement and photoionization modeling uncertainties .",
    "we have collected spectra of over 800  type 1 \" agns ( quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies ) from the hst archives and various ground - based observing programs to examine trends in their emission line properties ( dietrich et al . 2002 ) .",
    "578 of these spectra span the rest - frame uv wavelengths needed for this study .",
    "we compute five composite quasar spectra from this sample , representing different intervals in smbh mass from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "we present measurements of the emission lines in these composite spectra and investigate the relationship between smbh mass and the metallicity of the blr gas .",
    "we estimated black hole masses by applying the virial theorem , @xmath16 , to the line - emitting gas , where @xmath17 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath18 is the radial distance away from the smbh ( peterson & wandel 2000 ) .",
    "the relationship between @xmath17 and the fwhm of the broad emission line profile depends on the kinematics and geometry , but can be expressed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a factor on the order of unity ( mclure & dunlop 2001 ; vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) express the smbh mass as @xmath21 fwhm applies to the broad emission line profile , and @xmath22 is the radial distance between the blr and the central mass / continuum source . equation ( 1 ) assumes the gas in the blr is gravitationally bound and blr velocities are random . the exact geometry and kinematics are still debated ( e.g. mclure & dunlop 2001 ) , but are unknown , so we take this approach of random velocities ( @xmath23 ) because it is the most basic and allows for comparison with most other work . any offset in mass due to different geometric or kinematic assumptions would only affect the absolute smbh masses and not any trends derived between metallicity and smbh mass .",
    "we estimate @xmath22 based on the observed relation between @xmath22 for a particular line and the continuum luminosity ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; vestergaard 2002 ; wandel et al .",
    "1999 ) . a particular line must be specified because reverberation studies have shown that the blr is radially stratified , such that higher ionization lines tend to form closer to the central engine than lower ionization lines ( peterson 1993 ) .",

    "we choose to use the @xmath0 emission line instead of @xmath1 to estimate the smbh mass because it is more readily observed across the entire redshift range from @xmath27 0 to @xmath27 5 .",
    "may in fact yield a better estimate of smbh mass than @xmath1 because @xmath1 can include a narrow line component that forms in a different region and thus must be subtracted before measuring the fwhm .",
    "has no such narrow component ( wills et al .",
    "1993 , vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "it has recently been suggested that @xmath28 may be a better indicator of smbh mass than ( mclure & jarvis 2002 )",
    ". however , is observable over a wider range of redshifts and is clearly the best choice among uv lines at shorter wavelengths .",
    "significant blending effects are much less common for than other strong lines in the rest - frame uv spectrum and absorption effects are much less common for than for ( vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "reverberation studies indicate that the size of the broad emission line region for is about half that of @xmath1 ( stirpe et al .",

    "we modify equation ( 2 ) to account for this and we use a powerlaw of the form @xmath29 with @xmath30 to estimate a conversion between the continuum luminosity at 5100   and 1450  .",
    "we select @xmath30 based on average quasar spectra from brotherton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and dietrich et al .",
    "this yields @xmath31 ^{0.7 } \\ { \\rm lt - days}\\ ] ]    vestergaard ( 2002 ) finds that this technique of using the continuum luminosity and the fwhm of yields an estimate of the central black hole mass that has a 1@xmath4 uncertainty of a factor of three when compared to reverberation mapping studies that use @xmath1 to estimate smbh masses . from equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath32 this is essentially the same as ( within 10% of ) the mass relationship derived by vestergaard using and @xmath33 ( for this comparison , we again assume the powerlaw index , @xmath30 between 1450 and 1350  . ) the difference of @xmath34 between the two formulae is negligible compared to the 1@xmath4 uncertainty of a factor of three . see also netzer ( 2003 ) and corbett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for further discussion of the uncertainties .",
    "while multi - epoch spectra are preferable ( to average over variabilities ) , single - epoch spectra may be used if the signal - to - noise ratio is high enough because the fwhm of single - epoch spectra are generally consistent with the fwhms of the mean and rms spectra obtained from multi - epoch observations ( vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "it is important to accurately measure the fwhm because the uncertainties in smbh mass are dominated by the uncertainties in the fwhm .",
    "our composite spectra are each made up of single - epoch observations of multiple quasars and therefore should be approximately equivalent to multi - epoch observations of the same sources .",
    "we have compiled a sample of more than 800 quasar spectra , spanning a redshift range from @xmath35 and six orders of magnitude in intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the spectra were obtained by several groups using various ground - based instruments , as well as the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ and the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. one unique aspect of this sample is that it contains new observations of faint quasars at redshift @xmath36 ( dietrich et al .",
    "thus we can avoid to some degree the bias toward higher luminosities at higher redshifts that affects other magnitude - limited samples .",
    "578 of the spectra have uv wavelength coverage that encompasses the range @xmath37  .",
    "each spectrum was transformed to the rest - frame using a redshift measured from the centroid of the upper 50% of the @xmath0 profile .",

    "we used radio flux densities given in vron - cetty & vron ( 2001 ) to determine the radio loudness for the quasars .",
    "we use an automated program to estimate the fwhm of in each spectrum .",
    "the program averages over noise by applying a smoothing routine that calculates the median of each five - pixel interval .",
    "it then fits a local linear continuum ( contrained by the flux in 25   wide intervals centered around 1442.5   and 1712.5  ) around , measures the peak flux of the emission line ( of the smoothed spectrum ) , and uses those to estimate the fwhm of the line .",
    "comparisons between the fwhms estimated by the program and those measured manually indicate an error of @xmath42% in the estimates .",
    "lines containing significant absorption are flagged by the program and their fwhms are estimated manually ( by manually interpolating across the absorption feature ) .",
    "we use the fwhm of and the continuum luminosity , @xmath43 to estimate the central smbh mass of each quasar based on equation ( 4 ) .",
    "we then sorted the quasars by smbh mass into five bins : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , and computed five composite spectra .",
    "each composite spectrum is the average of all the quasar spectra in a bin ( see table 1 for data about each composite spectrum , including the powerlaw index , @xmath49 , of the continuum fit , the number of objects contributing to the composite at and fwhm of and @xmath1 , continuum luminosity , and mean smbh mass ) .",
    "calculating composite spectra increases the signal - to - noise ratio significantly , making it easier to measure weaker emission lines that may be lost in the noise in individual spectra .",
    "since narrow absorption features may influence the emission line profiles in composite spectra , we developed a method to detect strong narrow absorption features that exclude the contaminated spectral region of individual spectra from the calculation of the composite spectrum .",
    "the procedure is roughly as follows ( see dietrich et .",
    "al 2002 for more details ) .",
    "first , a preliminary mean spectrum is calculated from all of the spectra in a given mass bin . each individual spectrum",
    "is then divided by this preliminary mean to derive a ratio spectrum .",
    "the ratio spectrum is smoothed with a running boxcar function , which provides in addition to the smoothed ratio also a root - mean - square ( rms ) value for each wavelength box .",
    "a narrow absorption line will cause a sharp increase in the rms spectrum .",
    "the contaminated spectral regions of individual spectra , identified by these rms spikes , are excluded from the calculation of the final composite spectra , and no interpolation has been applied ( dietrich et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we next corrected each composite spectrum for strong iron emission lines . to get a first estimate of the contribution of fe emission",
    ", we used the empirical fe emission template that was carefully extracted from izw1 by vestergaard & wilkes ( 2001 ) , which they very kindly provided for this study .",
    "the template is mostly emission but contains some emission as well .",
    "we have modified this fe emission template int he uv range @xmath50  in accordance with photoionization model calculations presented by verner et al.(1999 ) . based on our analysis of quasar composite spectra ( dietrich et al.2002 ) , we found that the strength of fe line emission in the wavelength range @xmath51is equal to @xmath522 %  of the integrated _ pseudo continuum _ flux in this wavelength range ( dietrich et al .",
    "fe contributions vary for other wavelength ranges , but we scale the entire template to match the 2% contribution in the range 1420  1470  .",
    "this estimate of a 2 % contribution is conservatively low to avoid over - subtraction of the fe emission template .",
    "the spectral width of the fe emission features was adjusted to a width corresponding to the fwhm of the @xmath0 emission line profile of each quasar .",
    "the appropriated scaled fe emission template was subtracted from the corresponding composite spectrum . in spite of its small contribution , the estimate of the fe line emission improves particularly the measurements of ] @xmath53 and lines such as @xmath54 near an unidentified @xmath55  emission feature ( laor et al.1994 ; vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ) .",
    "we used the task nfit1d in the iraf software package to fit the continuum of each fe - subtracted spectrum with a powerlaw of the form @xmath56",
    "@xmath10 @xmath57 .",
    "the fits were constrained by the flux in wavelength intervals between the emission lines , namely in 25   wide windows centered at 1460  , 1770  , and 2000  .",
    "the spectral indices overall differ from @xmath30 because the powerlaw fit is to a narrower wavelength range than , for example , dietrich et al .",
    "( 2002 ) or vanden berk et al .",
    "however , there is a significant trend for steeper ( softer ) uv spectra in the low - mass sources ( see table 1 ) .",

    ", we use the spectral fitting routine specfit ( kriss 1994 ) , which employs @xmath58 minimization .",
    "we fit each line with one or more gaussian profiles , with the understanding that each individual gaussian component may have no physical meaning by itself .",
    "our goal in fitting the lines is simply to measure the total line strengths free of blends .",
    "our strategy is to obtain the best fit with the least number of free paramaters and , when necessary , to use the profile of strong unblended lines , such as , to constrain the fits to weaker or more blended lines .",

    "the fluxes , rews , and fwhms given in table 2 are from the total fitted profiles , which can include several multiplet components and up to three gaussian profiles per component ( as described in the appendix ) .",
    "the primary uncertainty in our flux measurements is the continuum location .",
    "we estimate the 1 @xmath4 standard deviation of our measurements of the fluxes of and  to be @xmath5910% based on repeated estimates with the continuum drawn at different levels . by the same method , we estimate the uncertainty in , ] , , ] , and other weaker lines to be @xmath521020% .",

    "five composite spectra , created from objects in selected ranges in smbh mass ( derived from using eqn . 4 and plotted as open boxes with error bars ) , do appear to be consistent with the expectation that fwhm ( ) = @xmath61 fwhm(@xmath1 ) .",

    "1 and 2 ) that we used to constrain our continuum fits ( see  3 ) . in the higher mass spectra , and + ] seem to blend together , never quite reaching the true continuum , and instead forming a  u \" shape .",
    "this effect of overestimating the continuum could lead to underestimates of ] and ] in the higher mass spectra and thus negate or weaken any real trend between smbh mass and the flux ratios involving these lines . for example , we find that a drop in the continuum level of only 5% will more than double the measured flux in ] and ] , but increase the flux in stronger lines by only @xmath52 15% to 30% .    in order to more thoroughly examine the effects of fwhm on the measured line fluxes , we sort the quasar spectra by the fwhm of and create composite spectra for different ranges in fwhm .",
    "we then fit the continuum and measure the emission line fluxes as described in  3 .",
    "the resulting line ratios are plotted in figure 11 .",
    "we find that the flux ratio of ] / remains roughly constant at different line widths , but ] / declines as the lines get broader . because of this , we again see a discrepancy in metallicity trends between ratios involving ] and those involving .",
    "the ratios involving indicate increasing metallicity with increasing line width .",
    "this is expected because objects with broader emission lines should have higher black hole masses and thus higher metallicities (  1 ) .",
    "the ] ratios , however , show a ",
    "u \"- like behavior in figure 11 , with the narrowest lines having the highest metallicity .",
    "the composite spectrum with the narrowest lines is also the only one in which the metallicities derived from ] ratios agree with those derived from ratios .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the discrepancy between the line ratios .",
    "the first possibility is that is somehow enhanced in quasars with broader emission lines ( and/or larger @xmath63 and @xmath65 ) by a process that we do not understand .",
    "the second possibility is that we are systematically overestimating the continuum and thus underestimating the flux of ] in spectra with broader lines .",
    "there is evidence supporting the latter hypothesis in that ] / and ] / behave similarly in our overall quasar sample . in particular , when ] / is larger / smaller than average , ] / is also larger / smaller by roughly the same factor .",
    "the intercombination lines scale roughly together compared to the permitted lines of the same element .",
    "the somewhat different behaviors of ] / and ] / in figure 11 ( sorted by fwhm ) therefore suggest that we are underestimating the weak ] line in the broader line sources .",
    "the u - like shape of the ] / ] and ] / ] points in this figure could then be caused by an increasing underestimate of ] as the fwhm increases from @xmath522000 km s@xmath39 to @xmath525000 km s@xmath39 , offset by the increasing n / o and n / c abundance ratios for fwhm @xmath67 km s@xmath39 .",
    "thus , we believe this is the more likely scenario .",
    "this scenario may also explain the fact that the metallicities derived from all ratios agree for objects with narrow emission lines ( see also warner et al .",
    "2002 ; baldwin et al . 2003 ) , in which the continuum is unlikely to be systematically overestimated .",
    "our main result from  5 is that the data are consistent with a trend between blr metallicity and smbh mass .",
    "the hypothesis motivating this work (  1 ) was that there should be a trend between metallicity and smbh mass with roughly the same slope as the mass - metallicity relation in elliptical galaxies , if the blr gas was enriched by stars in the agn s host galaxy .",
    "we use a plot of @xmath68 index vs. velocity dispersion , @xmath4 , in bender et al .",

    "we employ a @xmath58 minimization routine to obtain linear fits to the plots of metallicity vs. smbh mass shown in figure 10 .",
    "these fits yield a slope of @xmath78 for all ratios involving .",
    "this is consistent with the slope of the mass - metallicity relation in elliptical galaxies as expected .",
    "the slope for the average metallicity vs. smbh mass is @xmath520.2 , slightly lower than the slopes for the ratios .",
    "the slope for ratios involving ] is @xmath520 , but the slope from only the three highest mass spectra for these ratios is @xmath79 .",
    "this may be a lower bound on the slope of metallicity vs. smbh mass because in the highest mass spectra , the increasing n / o and n / c abundance ratios are starting to dominate the underestimation of ] caused by the systematic overestimation of the continuum in spectra with broad lines .",
    "it should be noted that the quasar - blr metallicities are several times higher than the galactic values derived in the studies listed above .",
    "this apparent discrepancy can be understood in the context of normal galaxy evolution .",
    "quasar blrs sample an earlier evolutionary stage and frequently a different physical location in galaxies compared to the regions or average spectra of stars in present day galaxies ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "however , the similar slope of the mass - metallicity relationship in both quasars and galaxies supports the premise that the gas in the blr was processed / enriched by the surrounding stellar population .    the evidence presented here for a mass - metallicity relationship among quasars does not prove that smbh mass is the fundamental parameter affecting blr metallicity .",
    "however , in these composite spectra , sorted by smbh mass , the slope of the trend between _ luminosity _ and metallicity is at least as steep as ( and possibly marginally steeper than ) the slope is for composite spectra sorted by luminosity ( see dietrich et al .",
    "2002 ; dietrich et al .",
    "2003 , in prep ) . also , composite spectra created from different ranges in eddington ratio , @xmath80 , show a slight trend with luminosity , but no trend with either smbh mass or metallicity ( see warner et al .",
    "2003 , in prep ) .",
    "these results suggest that smbh mass could be the fundamental parameter .",
    "further support for mass as the fundamental parameter comes from the similarity of the mass - metallicity relationship among quasars to the corresponding relationship among galaxies .",
    "these ideas are also consistent with the growing evidence ( e.g. shields et al .",
    "2002 ) for a close relationship between quasars and their host galaxies .",
    "in particular , the relationship between smbh mass and host galaxy mass ( see refs . in  1 ) indicates that i ) smbhs are a natural byproduct of galaxy formation , and ii ) essentially all massive galaxies were at one time  active . \"",
    "quasars at high redshifts are signposts of the last stages in the formation of these massive smbhs in the cores of young galactic spheroids .",

    "this rapid evolution at high redshifts , though , is well within the parameters derived in some recent simulations , which show that the densest protogalactic condensations can form stars and reach solar or higher metallicities at @xmath81 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; haiman & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "we have investigated a large sample of 578 agns for a trend between metallicity and smbh mass .",
    "the sample covers a redshift range from @xmath35 , six orders of magnitude in luminosity , and five orders of magnitude in smbh mass .",

    "<S> we analyze spectra for a large sample of 578 active galactic nuclei to examine the relationships between broad emission line properties and central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate smbh masses by applying the virial theorem to the @xmath0 broad emission line . </S>",
    "<S> although the fwhms of and @xmath1 appear nearly unrelated in individual objects , these fwhms are well correlated when averaged over sub - samples in our database . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the lines are equally valid indicators of the average smbh mass in quasar samples . </S>",
    "<S> our sample spans five orders of magnitude in smbh mass , six orders of magnitude in luminosity , and a redshift range from @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> most lines diminish in equivalent width with increasing black hole mass ( the usual  baldwin effect \" ) and there are no trends with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies indicate that there is a relationship between smbh mass and the overall bulge / spheroidal component mass of the surrounding galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this relation , together with the well - known mass - metallicity relationship among galaxies , predicts a relationship between smbh mass and quasar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the metallicity in the broad emission line region by comparing several line ratios involving nitrogen to theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the data are consistent with a trend between smbh mass and metallicity , with some line ratios indicating a very strong trend , but the uncertainties in several other important line ratios are too large to confirm or test this correlation . </S>"
