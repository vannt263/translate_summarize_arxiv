    "photosynthetic organisms have evolved a system of light - harvesting antenna complexes that absorb energy from sunlight and funnel it into a reaction centre where the captured light energy is converted into stored chemical energy  @xcite . for this extended system to function effectively ,",
    "energy transfer through the antenna to the reaction centre must be efficient , in the sense that energy is transferred from molecule to molecule with high probability .",
    "the flow of energy also needs to be preferentially directed toward the reaction centre . understanding how such efficient and directional energy transport arises in natural photosynthetic systems is currently a major area of research .",
    "two theoretical approaches to studying energy transport are usually distinguished .",
    "when the coupling between molecules in a network is weak compared to their interaction with the environment , energy transfer is incoherent and can be described as an effectively classical ` hopping ' process with rates determined by the fermi golden rule .",
    "the opposite limit is the coherent or exciton approach , wherein the molecules are strongly coupled and interact only weakly with their environment .",
    "a major theoretical challenge is presented by the fact that many photosynthetic systems , such as the much - studied fenna - matthews - olson complex , fall into an intermediate regime .    in the incoherent frster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) model , the conditions for efficient and directional energy transfer are well understood  @xcite .",
    "the frster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) mechanism can facilitate efficient energy transfer only between resonant energy levels . in photosynthetic pigment - protein complexes ( ppcs ) ,",
    "however , chromophores are typically arranged so that their energy levels form a downhill gradient or ` energy funnel '  @xcite .",
    "such disordered systems can still support efficient energy transfer thanks to the existence of nuclear vibrational sidebands .",
    "resonant transfer occurs between a donor molecule and a vibrationally excited state of a lower - energy acceptor molecule .",
    "the vibrational excitations decay on a relatively fast timescale , creating a difference between the excitation and fluorescence frequencies of the molecule known as the stokes shift .",
    "the stokes shift favours downhill energy transfer , producing directionality in the fret mechanism .",
    "although nuclear vibrational modes are central to producing efficient one - way energy transport in the incoherent fret theory , coherent models of energy transfer are usually concerned with the electronic degrees of freedom alone .",
    "vibrations , whether they originate from intramolecular nuclear motion or motions of the protein and solvent environment , are reduced to a collective environment or ` bath ' which can then be treated at various levels of approximation . in the simplest case , often termed dephasing - assisted transport ( dat ) @xcite or environment - assisted quantum transport ( enaqt ) @xcite ,",
    "the primary effect of the bath is to dephase electronic coherences between different molecules .",
    "studies of this model have produced the important and seemingly counterintuitive insight that environmental noise can improve energy transport in disordered quantum networks  @xcite .",
    "as in the incoherent case , efficient energy transfer in coherent models requires resonance between molecules .",
    "consider the simple case of two sites .",
    "fully coherent hamiltonian dynamics can only produce full population transfer from one site to the other if the two sites have identical energies .",
    "once the energy difference exceeds the coupling , the amplitude of population oscillations is significantly reduced and the excitation becomes primarily localised on a single site .",
    "the localisation effects of quantum coherent dynamics in disordered systems can be overcome to some extent by the addition of dephasing .",
    "the environmentally induced energy fluctuations responsible for dephasing can momentarily bring the energies of two adjacent sites into resonance , allowing efficient transfer between them .",
    "however , since the energy gaps between adjacent chromophores can vary substantially , the individual dephasing rates required to optimise transport without completely destroying coherence must also vary substantially .",
    "studies on the fenna - matthews - olson complex ( fmo ) found optimised dephasing rates that differ in some cases by two orders of magnitude on adjacent sites  @xcite . in a highly structured ppc such as fmo , where the average chromophore separation is on the order of 1.2  nm @xcite",
    ", it seems unlikely that adjacent chromophores experience such drastically different noise levels .",
    "producing one - way energy transport in coherent models is more difficult .",
    "fully coherent hamiltonian evolution is inherently reversible .",
    "open quantum systems techniques overcome this problem by taking the quantum system under study to be coupled to a large environment , leading to effectively irreversible evolution .",
    "such evolution may or may not appear as a directional , coherent energy transfer process .",
    "pure dephasing , as in dat / enaqt models , results in a diffusive process whose limiting distribution is equal population on each site in the system  @xcite . in order to achieve one - way energy transport ,",
    "these models rely on the addition of a trap site to which energy is transferred irreversibly at a constant rate .",
    "this mechanism is designed to model exciton transfer from peripheral complexes to the reaction centre  @xcite . in the case of the much - studied fmo complex",
    ", there is in fact very little experimental data on which to base the trapping model  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the key experiments on energy transfer dynamics in fmo studied purified complexes that do not contain reaction centres , and thus any observed directionality must originate from a different mechanism .    the stokes shift together with the downhill arrangement of energy levels provides directionality in the incoherent fret model",
    ". however , the level of approximation employed in deriving pure dephasing models eliminates the stokes shift .",
    "the lindblad master equation with pure dephasing is equivalent to the stochastic haken - strobl model  @xcite .",
    "the latter corresponds to the fast modulation or high temperature limit , in which the bath a has zero correlation time  @xcite , and the stokes shift vanishes in this limit  @xcite .",
    "leegwater  @xcite has further shown that coherent dynamics with pure dephasing is identical to the incoherent hopping predicted by fret when the interaction with the environment becomes much larger than the coherent coupling between individual molecules . in the high - temperature limit required for the bath correlation time to vanish",
    ", the fret rates for forward and backward energy transfer become equal and there is no longer a preferred transfer direction .",
    "recent work , both experimental and theoretical , has shown that vibrations in ppcs do not behave like simple thermal bath with a smooth spectral density .",
    "vibrational spectroscopy has revealed rich intramolecular vibrational structures in fmo  @xcite and other photosynthetic complexes  @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of fmo have likewise shown that the spectral density contains a number of distinct peaks that can be attributed to intramolecular nuclear vibrational modes  @xcite .",
    "some recent numerical studies have suggested that these modes may play a substantial role in coherent energy transfer  @xcite , particularly as a number of vibrational frequencies lie within the range of exciton energy splittings and resonance effects may therefore be important  @xcite .",
    "however , the microscopic mechanisms by which vibrations can contribute to energy transfer are not well understood and the specific role of resonance has yet to be conclusively demonstrated .",
    "the theory introduced here provides an alternative approach to satisfying the conditions of resonance and directionality , by including nuclear vibrational modes explicitly in the coherent part of the system under study . as in fret",
    ", resonant transfer occurs between a donor molecule and a vibrationally excited state of the acceptor molecule .",
    "subsequent decay of the vibrational excitation effectively produces a stokes shift , creating a preferential direction of transfer .",
    "however , in our model both the electronic states and the relevant vibrational states are treated coherently within an exciton approach .",
    "the environmental interaction is still described by a lindblad master equation , as in dat / enaqt - type models , retaining much of the simplicity of pure dephasing models while incorporating critical features of nuclear vibrational coupling .",
    "the starting point for our theory is the standard electronic hamiltonian @xmath0 used in exciton theory  @xcite . in the site basis , the electronic hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of chromophores or sites , @xmath3 denotes the electronic excited state of molecule @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the electronic excitation energy of @xmath3 relative to its ground state @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the excitonic coupling between sites @xmath4 and @xmath8 .    to the electronic hamiltonian we add two additional terms , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , to describe the vibrational modes and their coupling to the electronic states , respectively .",
    "the relevant vibrational modes are intramolecular vibrations excited by the electronic transition from ground to excited state  @xcite . nonlinear polyatomic molecules with _",
    "n _ atoms possess 3__n__-6 nuclear degrees of freedom excluding rotations ( in the eckart conditions ) and translations .",
    "these motions - molecular vibrations - are usually described within the harmonic approximation as small displacements on a parabolic potential energy surface around an equilibrium position .",
    "when a chromophore absorbs an incoming photon , an electron is promoted from an occupied low - energy molecular orbital to an unoccupied one with higher energy .",
    "the excitation is much faster than nuclear motions and thus , within the franck - condon approximation , it is assumed that nuclei remain static during the optical excitation and afterwards relax to the excited - state equilibrium geometry .",
    "to lowest order , the excited state normal modes can be approximated by the same parabolic potential energy surfaces as in the ground state but with a displaced equilibrium position .",
    "a similar process occurs during fluorescence emission : the nuclei remain static during the transition - in this case at the equilibrium geometry of the excited electronic state - and after the change in electronic state , vibrational modes mediate the relaxation to the ground state equilibrium geometry .",
    "experimentally , the energy difference between absorption and emission peaks in the spectra is termed the stokes shift .",
    "the vibrational hamiltonian consists of @xmath11 vibrational modes of each of the @xmath4 molecules : @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the raising ( lowering ) operator for the mode with frequency @xmath15 .",

    "even a system as small as fmo has around thirty strong vibrational modes  @xcite , making a full system treatment intractable .",
    "however , we argue here that only the vibrational levels that create resonant pathways through the network contribute substantially to the dynamics of energy transfer . with this restriction",
    "the system size can be substantially reduced while retaining the essential physics .      to illustrate the vibration - assisted resonance mechanism we construct a minimal model , based on sites 1 - 3 of the fmo complex , in which the relevant physical effects can be clearly seen . to a good approximation",

    "another experiment designed to compare the 2d spectra of bchl  _ a _ in solution with the spectra of fmo was unable to resolve more than two vibrational modes , which had frequencies well above those relevant for our model @xcite .",
    "neither of these experiments would seem to rule out a vibration - assisted resonance mechanism .    on the other hand , an experiment examining the inhomogeneous broadening of the exciton 1 - 3 coherence in fmo found the energy gap between the exciton levels to be quite consistent across the sample  @xcite .",
    "this is not necessarily a general feature of photosynthetic pigment - protein complexes , as the authors also studied the lh2 antenna complex from purple bacteria and found a large degree of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "their result supports the idea that having a well - defined exciton splitting is important to the functioning of the fmo complex .",
    "such an interpretation would be more consistent with our model , which requires a close match between the exciton splitting and a specific vibrational frequency , than with the dephasing - assisted mechanism that places no restrictions on the exciton splittings .",
    "ultimately , though , determining whether coherent vibration - assisted resonance plays a significant role in biological function will require a better understanding of the kinetics and decoherence properties of pigment - protein complexes .    finally , we speculate that the vibration - assisted resonance mechanism may be able to shed some light on the current controversies over experiments demonstrating long - lived coherence oscillations in the fmo complex .",
    "the model suggests that the intramolecular components of the vibrational spectral density can enhance coherent transport rather than destroying it .",
    "this is in contrast to the conclusions of christensson  _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . the vibronic theory of refs .",
    "@xcite neglects noise effects , including damping , on the vibrational mode and focuses on vibrational coherences that are localised on a single pigment .",
    "our results show that the resonance - induced delocalisation of the mixed vibronic - excitonic states and the decay of vibrational excitations are key to the enhancement of transport .",
    "indeed , by strongly mixing a vibrationally excited level on one site with the vibrational ground state of another site , vibration - assisted resonance creates an even greater degree of coherent delocalisation across the network than excitonic coupling alone .",
    "more significantly , the microscopic mechanism presented here may be able to conceptually reconcile the large reorganisation energies found in atomistic numerical studies  @xcite with experimental observations showing the persistence of coherent oscillations up to physiological temperatures  @xcite .",
    "further work on the full fmo complex with multiple vibrational modes and finite temperatures will address this question .",
    "helpful discussions with aggie braczyk , simon benjamin , erik gauger , kieran higgins , felix pollock , amir fruchtman , vaia patta , and elliott levi are gratefully acknowledged .",
