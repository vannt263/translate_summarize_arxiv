    "millisecond oscillations in the x - ray brightness of thermonuclear x - ray bursts ( so called `` burst oscillations '' ) have now been reported for 10 low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems ( see strohmayer 2001 for a review ) .",
    "all of these results are based on observations with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) except for the evidence for burst oscillations from the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808 - 369 which is based on sax wide field camera ( wfc ) data ( see int zand et al .",
    "a large body of evidence supports the hypothesis that these oscillations are produced by rotational modulation of a hot spot ( or possibly a pair of hot spots ) induced on the neutron star surface by inhomogeneous nuclear burning .",
    "in particular , the large modulation amplitudes , high coherence and long term stability of the frequency are fully consistent with the rotational modulation scenario ( see strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997 ; strohmayer et al . 1998a ; strohmayer & markwardt 1999 ; muno et al .",
    "2000 and strohmayer et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "the oscillation frequency during a burst is usually not constant .",
    "often the frequency is observed to increase by @xmath9 hz in the cooling tail , reaching a plateau or asymptotic limit .",
    "strohmayer et al . (",
    "1997 ) have suggested that the time evolution of the burst oscillation frequency results from angular momentum conservation of the thermonuclear shell .",
    "the burst expands the shell , increasing its rotational moment of inertia and slowing its spin rate . near burst onset",
    "the shell is thickest and thus the observed frequency lowest .",
    "the shell spins back up as it cools and recouples to the underlying neutron star .",
    "cumming & bildsten ( 2000 ) studied this mechanism in some detail and concluded that it appeared to be viable .",
    "however , more recent work by cumming et al ( 2001 ) which corrects an error in the previous work and includes general relativistic effects suggests that it may not be able to account for all of the observed frequency evolution .",
    "spitkovsky , levin & ushomirsky ( 2001 ) , however , suggest that geostrophic effects due to the coriolis force may account for the additional frequency evolution .",
    "nevertheless , this scenario suggests that the limiting frequency is the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "we note , however , that not all bursts exhibit this behavior .",
    "for example , strohmayer ( 1999 ) and miller ( 2000 ) identified a burst from 4u 1636 - 53 ( burst 4 in table 2 ) with a spin down of the oscillations in the decaying tail .",
    "this burst also had an unusually long decaying tail which may have been related to the spin down episode .",
    "muno et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also reported an episode of spin down in a burst from ks 1731 - 260 .",
    "the long term ( over year timescales ) stability of burst oscillations from 4u 1728 - 34 and 4u 1636 - 53 has been studied by strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1998b ) . for three bursts from 4u 1728 - 34 separated in time by @xmath10 years they found the 363 hz burst frequency to be highly stable , with an estimated time scale to change the oscillation period of about 23,000 years .",
    "based on a study of three bursts from 4u 1636 - 53 ( bursts number 1 , 2 & 3 in table 2 ) spanning a much shorter time interval ( about 1 day ) they suggested that the observed changes in the limiting frequency of the 581 hz oscillation might be due to orbital motion of the neutron star , which could provide a way of deriving or constraining the x - ray mass function of the system .",
    "however , with only three bursts available at the time it was not possible to test this hypothesis definitively nor draw any strong conclusions on the mass function .",
    "4u 1636 - 53 is perhaps the best system in which to search for such an effect since the orbital period is known and a large sample of bursts have now been obtained with rxte .",
    "for plausible system parameters and the orbital period of @xmath113.8 hours the expected doppler shifts are of order a part in @xmath12 .",
    "the optical counterpart of 4u 1636 - 53 , v801 arae , has been observed many times since its identification in 1977 ( mcclintock et al .",
    "1977 ) and a collection of photometric data , from july 1980 to may 1988 , was compiled by van paradijs et al .",
    "( 1990 ) ( see references therein ) .",
    "the van paradijs et al .",
    "( 1990 ) ephemeris was later revised by augusteijn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who identified a cycle miss count by reanalysing all the old data and incorporating newer observations made between june 1992 and august 1993 .",
    "augusteijn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also reported some spectroscopic measurements of emission and absorbtion line features .    in this paper",
    "we report new photometric light curves of 4u 1636 - 53 obtained over the period 1998 march to 2001 may and use them to revise the ephemeris of augusteijn et al .",
    "we then use this new emphemeris to derive the binary phases of rxte x - ray bursts and examine the possibility that the distribution of observed asymptotic burst oscillation periods is consistent with doppler modulation caused by the orbital velocity of the neutron star .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 we begin with a discussion of our new optical observations .",
    "we then explore in  3 the implications of our new observations for the ephemeris of maximum light from v801 arae .",

    "5 we summarize our findings and discuss their implications for the component masses and binary geometry of 4u 1636 - 53 . we conclude with a discussion of future improvements to our constraints expected from a larger sample of x - ray bursts .",
    "all the optical observations described in this paper were made using the mt .",
    "canopus 1-m telescope at the university of tasmania observatory .",
    "the observations used standard _ v _ & _ i _ filters and the ccd reduction procedure was identical to that described in giles , hill & greenhill ( 1999 ) .",
    "all times presented in this paper have been corrected to heliocentric julian dates ( hjd ) and a complete journal of the observations is given in table 1 . for the 1998 observations",

    "three _ v _ band light curves from 1998 are shown in figure 1 which plots the differential magnitudes with respect to a brighter star that can be located on the finder chart in mcclintock et al . ( 1977 ) .",
    "this secondary standard is at the western end of the 20@xmath19 scale bar ( see figure 2 on their 2s1636 - 536 chart ) .",
    "4u 1636 - 53 is star number 3 on this same chart and is @xmath20 _ v _ magnitudes dimmer than our secondary standard . for the 1999 and later observations",
    "the telescope was equipped with an site ccd camera having 512 x 512 pixels with an image scale of @xmath16 pixel@xmath5 .",
    "the reduction procedures for these observations were similar to the 1998 data and the same local secondary standard was used . in figure 2",
    "we show the light curves for the nights of 1999 june 9 and 2001 may 7 & 8 .",
    "we do not show plots for the remaining nights listed in table 1 since the individual time spans are rather limited .",
    "the ephemeris for maximum optical light given by augusteijn et al . ( 1998 ) is hjd = 2446667.3183(26 ) @xmath21 [ n @xmath17 0.15804738(42 ) ] where the errors are indicated in the round brackets .",
    "this ephemeris was based on observations made between 1980 july 11 and 1993 july 12 and covers a total of 30048 binary periods .",
    "the predictions for this ephemeris are shown on figures 1 & 2 as the dotted trace in the lower section of each light curve panel .",
    "there is a small phase shift evident between our data and the prediction after extrapolating forward in time for the additional @xmath1118080 binary periods to 2001 may .",
    "we have fitted a sine curve to the 2001 may 7 & 8 data and determined that the phase difference at this epoch is @xmath22 .",
    "this can be eliminated by reducing the period of augusteijn et .",
    "1998 ) by a very small amount and , assuming that there is no cycle mis - count which is very unlikely , this period change corresponds to 1.65 times their quoted error .",
    "we therefore adopt the following new ephemeris for the time of maximum light hjd = 2446667.3183(26 ) @xmath21 [ n @xmath17 0.15804669(24 ) ] . after adjusting the modulation amplitude and mean level this ephemeris",
    "is plotted as the solid line in figures 1 & 2 and although derived from fitting only the data from 2001 may 7 & 8 it appears reasonably consistent with the other four light curves .",
    "the night of 1998 april 3 in figure 1 does have an odd profile but van paradijs et al .",
    "( 1990 ) have previously commented on multi - humped profiles which they had eliminated from their analysis procedure .",
    "our small change to the binary period would be expected to have a fairly minimal effect on the earlier light curves analysed by augusteijn et .",
    "1998 ) particularly for the older data .",
    "we have not attempted to revise the epoch of phase zero or its error as quoted by augusteijn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) since we do not have all the old raw data and phase zero is hard to define for this system where the light curve is quite variable and has no sharp features . in any case",
    "there is still an unknown relationship between the optical & true orbit phase zero and this will likely remain so at least until more extensive radial velocity observations are available . throughout this paper phase zero",
    "is defined as the optical maximum when superior conjunction of the companion star is thought to occur ( neutron star closest to the earth ) .",
    "a total of 30 x - ray bursts from 4u 1636 - 53 are available to us as public or pi data from the pca experiment on rxte and information about them relevant to this study are listed in table 2 .",
    "a comprehensive description of the properties of these bursts will be given elsewhere ( cummings & strohmayer 2001 ) .",
    "here we will be primarily interested in the asymptotic burst oscillation periods and inferred binary orbital phases of the bursts .",
    "the 1.72 ms ( 581 hz ) oscillation in most of these bursts exhibits a characteristic evolution towards a limiting ( shortest ) period in the tail of the burst .",
    "it was our aim to try and measure this limiting period for each burst in the sample . for most of these bursts",
    "we had event mode data with a time resolution of 1/8192 seconds across the entire 2 - 90 kev pca bandpass .",
    "in a few cases we had binned data with the same time resolution .",
    "we began by correcting the event arrival times to the solar system barycenter using the jpl de200 ephemeris and the standard rxte analysis tools ( either fxbary , or faxbary for the most recent data ) .",
    "we then calculated dynamic variability spectra using the @xmath23 statistic ( see strohmayer & markwardt 1999 for a discussion and example ) .",
    "such spectra are essentially similar to standard fft dynamic power spectra except that we oversample in frequency .",
    "we used 2 s intervals and start a new interval every 0.125 s. we oversample in frequency by a factor of 16 . for each burst",
    "we calculated two dynamic spectra , one using data across the entire bandpass , and a second using only a hard band from @xmath24 kev .",
    "we did this because burst oscillation amplitudes are often stronger at higher energies ( see for example strohmayer et al .",
    "1997 ) . to determine the asymptotic period we searched the pair of dynamic power spectra of each burst and",
    "determined the shortest period detectable during each burst . by detectable we mean that the signal peak had to be larger than @xmath25 , which corresponds to a single trial significance of @xmath26 .",
    "as an example figure 3 shows a typical dynamic spectrum from one of our bursts and the power spectrum from which the asymptotic period was deduced ( burst 20 in table 2 , in this case the spectrum from the hard band ) . in most cases a clear frequency track of the oscillation could be seen in the dynamic power spectrum , and the procedure was straightforward .",
    "in several cases , either the oscillations were very weak or the frequency evolution was `` anomalous '' ( meaning the frequency was observed to decrease with time ) , and in these cases we judged that an asymptotic period could not be reliably measured .",
    "an example of this is the burst which occurred on 1996 december 31 ( burst 4 in table 2 ) and has been discussed in detail by strohmayer ( 1999 ) .",
    "we note that this was the case for only 4 bursts in our sample , so that in the majority of cases the asymptotic period was reasonably well defined .",
    "although these bursts could not be used for the present investigation , for completeness , we also include them in table 2 .",
    "we selected the shortest asymptotic period measured in either power spectra as the asymptotic value for that burst .",
    "these periods are also listed in table 2 .",
    "the column in table 2 showing the burst binary phases has been derived using the new optical ephemeris described in the previous section . the phase error for each burst",
    "is dominated by the ability to determine the optical phase zero for any particular epoch but is typically @xmath27 .",
    "relative phase errors are much smaller given the @xmath2848,000 cycle time span of the optical observations and the fact that the x - ray bursts used here all occur within a time interval of @xmath29 years ( only 10,000 cycles ) ending in 2001 may .",
    "an important quantity to understand is the characteristic error , @xmath30 , in our period measurements . to estimate this",
    "we have carried out a series of simulations which mimic the conditions of our asymptotic period measurements .",
    "to do this we first generate a count rate model comprised of a constant plus a sinusoidal modulation of fixed period and amplitude .",
    "we then generate random realizations of this model using the same temporal resolution as our burst data .",
    "we model a 2 s interval of data since this was the interval length we used for all our dynamic spectra .",
    "we use a count rate and modulation amplitude typical of the intervals in the tails of bursts where we actually measure the asymptotic periods .",
    "we then compute the @xmath23 spectra for each of the simulated data sets and determine the centroid period of the signal .",
    "since typically we follow the signal in a real burst down to or near a limiting threshold ( in this case @xmath31 ) , we only keep simulated period measurements for which the peak signal power was close to our limiting threshold . in practice we found that @xmath32 was characteristic of our actual asymptotic period measurements .",
    "we then determine how these simulated periods are distributed around the true period .",
    "specifically we fit a gaussian to the distribution of simulated periods and identify the width of this gaussian with the characteristic uncertainty , @xmath30 , in any one of our period measurements .",
    "figure 4 shows the period distribution and best fitting gaussian derived from one of these simulations .",
    "we find that the typical measurement error associated with one of our periods is @xmath33 ms .",
    "note that this is purely a statistical uncertainty .",
    "another source of possible systematic error is associated with the assumption that the last period detected in a dynamic spectra represents a limiting value .",
    "we will have more to say on this in a later section .",
    "we used the period measurements from table 2 to construct a distribution of asymptotic periods .",
    "figure 5 shows a histogram representation of the distribution .",
    "although the range of all observed periods is rather large , a subset of @xmath0 of the bursts form a tightly peaked distribution .",
    "also shown in figure 5 is the gaussian model which best fits this cluster of periods .",
    "the gaussian is centered at @xmath34 ms , has a width of @xmath35 and gives an excellent fit to the data .",
    "this subset is comprised of bursts from all epochs of our sample , and suggests that a highly stable underlying period is responsible for this component of the asymptotic period distribution .",
    "note also that the width of this distribution is comparable to our estimate above of the typical width which would be produced by statistical uncertainties alone .",
    "this suggests that any systematic error associated with our measurements not reflecting a true limiting value are small , at least within this subset of the entire sample .      assuming that the burst oscillations do reflect the spin of the neutron star the binary motion should imprint doppler modulations on the measured periods .",
    "we use the values from table 2 to construct in figure 6 a plot of asymptotic period against photometric ( orbital ) phase . visual inspection of this plot reveals no strong indication of a sinusoidal modulation that might be produced by a sufficiently strong doppler modulation .",
    "such a modulation would likely have a peak on figure 6 at a phase of @xmath36 , when the neutron star has a maximum recession velocity assuming that photometric maximum occurs at superior conjunction of the secondary .",
    "we tested this conclusion quantitatively by fitting a period - phase model to the data .",
    "we used the model @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the period measured at inferior conjunction of the neutron star ( neutron star nearest to observer ) , the projected orbital velocity of the neutron star with respect to the center of mass of the binary , and the orbital phase at which the burst occurred , respectively .",
    "figure 6 also shows the results of such fits .",
    "the model prefers a small @xmath41 , with @xmath42 for 16 degrees of freedom .",
    "this model is the solid curve in figure 6 .",
    "however , the difference between this fit and one with @xmath43 is not statistically significant ( @xmath44 ) , hence the data are consistent with no doppler modulation .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath7 confidence upper limits ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) on @xmath48 are 55 and 75 km @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the model with @xmath50 km @xmath49 is the dashed curve in figure 6 .",
    "note that these fits assumed that the relative phase of the modulation is known based on the photometric ephemeris .",
    "if we relax this assumption and allow the phase of the peak modulation to be a parameter we find a better fit with @xmath51 km @xmath49 , with @xmath15 confidence range of @xmath52 km @xmath49 ( dotted curve in figure 6 ) . however , the phase offset required would be 0.2 away from that implied under the assumption that phase zero ( photometric maximum ) is at superior conjunction of the secondary .",
    "although this seems large it might be possible if x - ray heating of the disk bulge and accretion stream interaction region contribute to the observed optical modulations .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "although we do not detect any doppler modulation we were able to place an upper limit on @xmath48 from the period - phase data . since there was no strong evidence for a modulation with orbital phase we also investigated the upper limit using only the expected distribution of periods for a given @xmath53 and @xmath30 . to do this we generated an expected period distribution by sampling a large number of random periods from the model .",
    "samples were drawn uniformly in orbital phase and the random period was selected from a gaussian distribution with width @xmath30 centered on the model period for that phase .",
    "we then binned the sample periods in the same manner as the data and computed a @xmath54 goodness of fit statistic @xmath55 . since our data have small numbers of events in each bin we computed the upper limit for @xmath56 using monte carlo simulations .",
    "our resulting upper limit using this method is in good agreement with our result from the period versus phase fits .",
    "we have investigated the asymptotic period distribution of burst oscillations in a large sample of bursts from 4u 1636 - 53 .",
    "we find that @xmath0 of these bursts form a tight distribution consistent with being produced by a highly stable mechanism such as rotation of the neutron star .",
    "the fact that the distribution is made up of bursts spanning a time scale of 4.4 years and has a characteristic width of @xmath57 indicates that the time scale to change the underlying period is @xmath58 yr .",
    "this is comparable to the overall period stability estimated for the 363 hz oscillations in 4u 1728 - 34 ( see strohmayer et al .",
    "1998b ) , and is a number characteristic of other rotating neutron stars such as x - ray pulsars .",
    "this provides further evidence that rotation of the neutron star sets the burst oscillation period .",
    "why do some of the bursts fall well outside this distribution ?",
    "it seems likely that several effects may be at work here .",
    "one problem is that the oscillation in some bursts does not remain strong enough to detect for a long enough time interval within the burst , so that the asymptotic limit is not reached .",
    "this results because burst oscillation properties are not identical from burst to burst .",
    "another possible effect was discussed by cumming & bildsten ( 2000 ) .",
    "they argued that as long as the burning shell was not recoupled to the neutron star the frequency observed in the burst tail would deviate slightly ( by about 1 part in @xmath12 ) from the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "this comes about because the thickness of the cooling atmosphere in the tail is different to the initial thickness by about 1 m , though the exact amount depends on the mean molecular weight of the burned material which in turn depends on how complete the burning was and would be expected to vary from burst to burst .",
    "although this could conceivably be a source of additional scatter in the asymptotic periods the fact that our observed distribution has a width comparable to that expected based on statistical uncertainty alone suggests that if operating at all it must be small .",
    "if the asymmetry on the star is created by a nonradial oscillation mode ( see for example bildsten & cutler 1995 ; strohmayer & lee 1996 ; heyl 2001 ) , then the observed oscillation frequency would always be close to the spin frequency or perhaps a multiple @xmath59 of it , but it could change by @xmath60 due to long term changes in the surface layers of the neutron star .",
    "this could produce outliers in the period distribution , but would also tend to produce a tight component as long as surface conditions were similar for enough bursts .",
    "recently , spitkovsky , levin & ushomirsky ( 2001 ) have also studied mechanisms which can cause frequency drift .",
    "they suggest that coriolis forces can have an important effect and might introduce shifts in the observed frequency comparable to those expected from radial uplift .      in general the optical flux from lmxbs is thought to be dominated by the accretion disk ( see van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 for a review ) .",
    "there are three regions of a lmxb system which might contribute to its optical variability due to x - ray heating .",
    "these are the accretion disk itself , a bright spot or bulge on the outer edge of the accretion disk formed by interaction of the accretion stream with the disk , and the hemisphere of the companion facing the neutron star which is not shadowed by the accretion disk . in lmxbs with relatively low inclinations ( @xmath61 ) it is this last region which is thought to dominate the optical modulations from the rest of the system ( van paradijs 1983 , van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 )",
    ". these systems generally produce sinusoidal optical modulations .",
    "the optical maximum therefore occurs when the companion is on the far side of the neutron star ( superior conjunction ) but there may be some asymmetry or variation about the mean profile due to gas flows causing various x - ray shielding effects ( pedersen et al .",
    "1982a ) .",
    "in order to explore the implications for the binary geometry of our radial velocity limit for the neutron star we have created in figure 7 a plot of the roche geometry for 4u 1636 - 53 . for the neutron star we assumed a mass of @xmath62 . for the secondary we use a mass of @xmath63 ( see smale & mukai 1988 ; patterson 1984 ) . with these masses and the known 3.8 hr orbital period the binary separation is @xmath64 .",
    "the velocities of the neutron star and secondary with respect to the center of mass would be @xmath65 and @xmath66 km s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "figure 7 shows a view looking down on the orbital plane of the system .",
    "the numbers circling the system denote orbital phase positions assuming phase zero occurs at superior conjunction of the secondary ( photometric maximum ) .",
    "the dashed circle shows the extent of a disk which fills 90 % of the roche lobe , a radius at which tidal effects will likely truncate it ( see for example frank , king & lasota 1987 ) .",
    "constraints from analysis of optical reprocessing of x - ray bursts also indicate a large accretion disk in 4u 1636 - 53 ( pedersen et al .",
    "we also show on the plot inferred locations of the radial velocity components measured by augusteijn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and given in their table 6 . since the inferred velocity amplitudes from their three sets of fits were all rather similar we just used the average velocity as well as the average uncertainty .",
    "we plotted with triangles the @xmath67 average velocity amplitude at the phases of superior conjunction given for each of their three fits .",
    "the phase locations were deduced by assuming that the entire binary system rotates rigidly about the center of mass .",
    "we also shaded the region enclosed by the triangles to further highlight its location .",
    "augusteijn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested the radial velocity components could be identified with the bulge region associated with the interaction of the accretion stream with the disk .",
    "our plot certainly supports this suggestion , since the shaded region is consistent with where the accretion stream would likely impact the disk .",
    "the location of the shaded region also suggests that the bulge might be a significant component with regard to optical modulations .",
    "in particular , if photometric maximum occurs closer to a phase of 0.8 in figure 7 , when the x - ray illuminated portion of the bulge is facing the observer , then the implied phase shift is in the same sense as that suggested by the fits to the period - phase data of the x - ray bursts with the phase shift left as a free parameter .",
    "more detailed modelling would be required to determine if the bulge can indeed effect the optical modulations at this level , but the period - phase fits are suggestive .",
    "we also note that although the three simultaneous x - ray & optical bursts discussed by pedersen et al .",
    "( 1982a ) ( see page 336 ) have relatively large error bars on the optical time delays we have re - examined them in the light of our new ephemeris and the system model shown in figure 7 .",
    "the optical delays in these bursts appear more consistent , both in delay and phase , with the reprocessed x - ray burst optical flux coming from the outer parts of our shaded region in figure 7 than from the facing hemisphere of the companion star . although there is no evidence of a second optical pulse from the companion in the many optical bursts studied by pedersen et al .",
    "( 1982b ) a weaker following pulse might easily be lost",
    ". such a pulse might only be evident at optimum binary phases , around phase 0.85 , with reprocessing delays always tending to broaden and confuse the light curve features .",
    "although the radial velocities of the neutron star and secondary are not well measured in 4u 1636 - 53 , as figure 7 suggests the system is rather well constrained .",
    "the lack of eclipses implies that @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , no dipping or partical eclipses have been observed from 4u 1636 - 53 .",
    "the modelling of frank , king & lasota ( 1987 ) suggests that @xmath61 in such cases .",
    "we can combine our limits on the velocity of the neutron star with the radial velocity measurements to place constraints on the component masses . with the known orbital period we have that the neutron star velocity , @xmath69 with @xmath70 set to either our 90 or @xmath7 limit ( see  4.3 above ) . to derive mass constraints from the radial velocity data we required that the inferred location of the radial velocity components ( determined from the velocity amplitude and phase of superior conjunction data of augusteijn et al .",
    "1998 , see discussion above ) must fit within @xmath15 of the roche lobe radius of the neutron star ( a likely size for the accretion disk ) .",
    "this further assumes that the entire binary rotates rigidly around the center of mass .",
    "our constraints are summarized in figure 8 .",
    "we show allowed regions in the component mass plane for a pair of different inclinations ( 50 and @xmath71 ) for our @xmath6 and @xmath7 neutron star velocity limits .",
    "indeed for @xmath72 km s@xmath5 the mass of the secondary must be significantly less than the @xmath63 estimate based on the mass - radius relation for main sequence stars .",
    "further , if the secondary is @xmath73 then the neutron star must be quite massive @xmath74 .",
    "the radial velocity constraints essentially exclude @xmath75 for any reasonable masses of the components .",
    "this is because the disk can not be big enough to allow high radial velocities if the inclination is too low .",
    "although this conclusion is dependent on our assumptions for deriving the radial velocity constraints , observations of large amplitude oscillations on the rising edge of bursts from this source also indicate that the inclination can not be too low ( see nath , strohmayer & swank 2001 ) .",
    "these arguments suggest a likely range for the inclination of @xmath76 . with this inclination a likely range of masses for the neutron star and secondary",
    "are , in solar units , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "more precise limits on the radial velocity of either component will allow more precise mass limits to be inferred .",
    "clearly additional optical photometry and spectroscopy are required for 4u 1636 - 53 , and at some time in the future it would prove worthwhile to collect together all the optical observations of 4u 1636 - 53 to derive a fully consistent ephemeris .",
    "as more burst data become available it should become possible to measure the neutron star velocity .",
    "for example , with a factor of 2 - 3 increase in the number of bursts with reliable asymptotic periods and with a burst oscillation period measurement uncertainty of @xmath79 ms , our simulations suggest that a velocity of @xmath80 km s@xmath5 ( equal to our current @xmath15 upper limit ) can be detected at better than @xmath81 confidence .",
    "figure 9 shows the results of such a simulation for 36 burst asymptotic period measurements .",
    "the bursts listed in table 2 were found in observations totaling @xmath82 msec of exposure . based on this x - ray burst rate the presently approved rxte observing time on 4u 1636 - 53 ( 1.15 msec in ao6 )",
    "can be expected to provide another @xmath83 x - ray bursts , which should roughly double the sample . since rxte provides much higher quality x - ray burst profiles than did hakucho , further attempts to get simultaneous x - ray - optical burst observations are clearly worthwhile but this requires and is dependant on the availability of a large optical telescope .",
    "we thank holger pedersen for re - examining and confirming the dates and times of observations of 4u 1636 - 53 made in 1980 .",
    "archive data was obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
