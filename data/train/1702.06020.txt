    "bose - einstein condensate of a low - density system of weakly interacting bose particles at zero temperature is usually described by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite , which is nowadays widely used for study of the condensates created in magnetic and laser traps @xcite .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation is obtained in the self - consistent field approximation , where the short - range correlations between particles are neglected . in this case , the bose system is described in terms of the coherent state vector@xcite . meanwhile",
    ", the consideration of the pair correlations , being essential at short distances , turns out to be important even for systems with low densities since it leads to some qualitatively new results .",
    "for example , in a dilute classical gas the account for pair correlations allows us to obtain the integral of collisions in the kinetic equation and , therefore , all effects which are described by the boltzmann equation @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we obtain the system of dynamical equations in the approximation in which besides the one - particle anomalous averages , the two - particle correlations are also taken into account but the correlations of more number of particles are neglected .",
    "small oscillations on the background of a spatially homogeneous equilibrium state are studied .",
    "it is shown that when considering pair correlations in bose - einstein condensate , there exist two branches of elementary excitations .",
    "one of them is acoustic , another one has an energy gap in the long wavelength limit . @xmath0",

    "the field operators satisfy the usual commutation relations .",
    "let @xmath9 is the average of field operator .",
    "then we can write down our field operator separating the @xmath10-number and operator parts : @xmath11 the operator part is defined so that it meets the obvious relations : @xmath12 here the averaging is implied in the sense of the quasiaverages for systems with broken phase symmetry @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the normal averages , which are invariant under the phase transformation of the field operators @xmath13 , and the anomalous averages , where this invariance is broken , are both nonzero .",
    "it is to be noted that the property of superfluidity is connected with just the existence of these anomalous averages .",
    "we introduce the the following notation for the anomalous average of the field operator @xmath14 the averages of the products of several field operators can be written in terms of the averages of the products of operators @xmath15 , which will be called as the overcondensate operators .",
    "for example , for the case of two field operators , using eq.(5 ) , we have @xmath16 similarly , we can write down the averages of a greater number of field operators",
    ". they will also contain the averages of a greater number of the overcondensate operators of the form @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and etc .",
    "setting successively the operator @xmath20 in the heisenberg equation ( 1 ) equal to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and carrying out averaging , we will get the infinite chain of coupled equations for the averages @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , which is similar to the bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon chain [ 6 ] in the kinetic theory of classical gases .",
