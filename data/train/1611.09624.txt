    "there is a myriad of foraging strategies that predators utilize to increase their rate of success . among them , preys may be attacked in a cooperative , coordinated way by a group of predators , whose similar actions are correlated in space and time .",
    "when this involves different and complementary behaviors , it is also called a collaboration  @xcite .",
    "examples of such coordinated or collaborative hunting are lions  @xcite ( including the pair of man - eaters lions of tsavo  @xcite ) , hawks  @xcite , crocodiles  @xcite , spiders  @xcite , and several other species  @xcite .",
    "interspecies collaborations exist as well ( for example , between fishermen and dolphins in the south of brazil  @xcite or between honey - hunters men and honeyguide birds in mozambique  @xcite , among others  @xcite ) .",
    "hunting in group may bring several benefits and has been widely discussed ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , it increases the probability of capturing a large prey  @xcite , helps prevent the carcass to be stolen by other predators  @xcite , allows for faster spotting  @xcite and more complex distracting , tracking and chasing tactics , helps related conspecific that may be unable to hunt or are in the process of acquiring hunting skills  @xcite , etc . on the other hand",
    ", there may be costs as it also increases the competition between members of the group while feeding , concentrates the search for food to a smaller territory what may decrease the number of available preys , etc .",
    "grouping tactics may also benefit preys  @xcite .",
    "surveillance is more efficient when done in parallel by several individuals while the others have more time to feed themselves  @xcite .",
    "the probability of being caught is smaller  @xcite and the group may take advantage of group distracting  @xcite , intimidating and escaping techniques . on the other hand , a group of preys may be more easily spotted than an isolated one and the resources should be shared by all members  @xcite .",
    "in addition to those factors , for both preys and predators , collective decision making can be improved in larger groups  @xcite ( but information sharing may involve costs  @xcite and benefits  @xcite as well ) .    despite those mounting experimental results , much less attention",
    "has been dedicated to model coordinate hunting  @xcite .",
    "recently , lett et al  @xcite ( hereafter referred as the lag model ) introduced a game theory model in which the abundances of preys and predators were assumed constant and only the fractions of those populations using either an individual or collective strategy coevolved ( see , however , ref .",
    "the lag model takes into account some of the advantages and disadvantages for both preys and predators choosing a grouping strategy .",
    "more specifically , it is assumed that grouping lowers the risk of being preyed at the cost of increasing the competition for resources , while predators have a greater probability of success at the expense of having to share the prey with others , sometimes referred to as the `` many - eyes , many mouths '' trade off  @xcite",
    ". preys and predators were modeled by assuming fully mixing ( no spatial structure ) , a mean field approach , and the temporal evolution of both densities being described by replicator equations  @xcite .",
    "a complementary approach , based on a less coarse grained description , explicitly considers the spatial distribution of individuals and groups .",
    "the local interactions between them introduce correlations that may translate into spatial organization favoring either grouping or isolated strategies , raising a number of questions . for instance , do these strategies coexist within predators or preys populations ? if yes , is this coexistence asymptotically stable ?",
    "how does the existence of a local group induce or prevent grouping behavior on neighboring individuals ? do gregarious individuals segregate , forming extended regions dominated by groups ? in other words , how spatially heterogeneous is the system ?",
    "does the replicator equation provide a good description for both the dynamics and the asymptotic state ? if not ,",
    "when does it fail ? if many strategies persist , which is the underlying mechanism that sustains the coexistence ?",
    "we try to answer some of these questions with a version of the lag model in which space is explicitly taken into account through a square lattice whose sites represent a small sub - population patch . each of the sites is large enough to contain only a single group of predators and preys at the same time .",
    "if any of these groups is ever disrupted , their members will resort to a solitary strategy , hunting or defending themselves alone .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review , in section  [ sec.rep ] , the lag model  @xcite and summarize the main results obtained with the replicators equation , and then describe , section  [ sec.space ] , the agent based implementation with local competition . the results obtained in this different framework are presented in sec .  [ sec.results ] .",
    "finally , we discuss our conclusions in section  [ sec.conc ] .",
    "lett et al  @xcite considered , within a game theoretical framework , grouping strategies for preys and predators .",
    "both can choose between single and collective behavior and each choice involves either gains or losses for the individuals , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the relevant parameters of the model are defined in table  [ table.parameters ] .",
    "the size of both populations is kept constant during the evolution of the system , only the proportion of cooperative predators , @xmath0 , and the fraction of gregarious preys , @xmath1 , evolve in time ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite for a version that also considers population dynamics ) . whether they increase or decrease depends on how their payoff compare with the average payoff of the respective whole population .",
    "if collective behavior earns a larger payoff than the average , the associated density increases , otherwise it decreases .",
    "this dynamics is then described by the replicator equations  @xcite .    .model",
    "parameters  @xcite along with the default value considered here .

    "when the remaining @xmath11 predators solely hunt , they are limited to a single prey and an efficiency that is further reduced by a factor @xmath12 , what is somehow compensated by not having to share it with others .",
    "this information is summarized in the payoff matrix : @xmath13 as isolated preys consume the available resources , the gain per unit of time , on average , is @xmath14 . once aggregated , the resources are shared and the individual gain reduced by a factor @xmath15 . the fraction of preys that aggregates becomes less prone to be preyed by a factor @xmath5 .",
    "if the grouped preys are attacked by a group of predators , @xmath6 preys are captured and lett et al  @xcite considered that the payoff coefficient is @xmath16 ( imposing @xmath17 ) .",
    "on the other hand , a lone predator has its efficiency reduced by a factor @xmath12 , thus the surviving probability is @xmath18 or @xmath19 for an individual or a group of preys , respectively .",

    "the above description of the competition between collective and individual strategies for both predators and preys does not take into account possible spatial correlations and geometrical effects .",

    "the unit cell corresponds to the smallest viable group and on each site of the lattice there may exist one or none of such groups . since both predators and",
    "preys coexist in each site , there are two variables @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the total number of sites and @xmath62 is the linear length of the square lattice ) that takes only the values 1 or 0 , the former when agents are grouped , the latter for independent individuals .    differently from the mean - field description where payoff was gained from interactions with all individuals in the system , alone or grouped , in the lattice version interactions are local and occur only between nearest neighbors sites ( self - interaction is also considered since each site has both predators and preys ) . at each step of the simulation , one site ( @xmath40 ) and one of its neighbors ( @xmath63 ) are randomly chosen .",
    "the predators ( preys ) on @xmath40 interact with the preys ( predators ) both on @xmath40 and in all neighboring sites , accumulating the payoff @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . at the same time , both groups in @xmath63 also accumulate their payoffs .",
    "the updating involves the site with the smallest payoff adopting the strategy of the other with a probability proportional to the difference of payoffs .",

    "[ fig.circ_invasion]a ) by first disrupting the preys organization , thus , the strategy 10 appears , invades 11 and , in turn , is invaded by 00 . in those cases that the invasion proceeds through an intermediate domain ( that is different from the diagonal strategies being neutral ) , we use a dashed arrow in the interaction graph .",
    "this cyclic dominance among the combined strategies of preys and predators is the underlying mechanism that explains the persistence of the coexistence state in this region of the phase diagram .",

    "[ fig.asympt.xy ] , the size dependent percolation threshold coincides  @xcite with the value of @xmath5 where @xmath94 drops to 0 and @xmath105 attains 1 .",
    "that is , once the combined cluster of 01 + 10 + 11 strategies percolates , disrupting the background 00 cluster , 01 is the only surviving strategy .",
    "this is a percolation triggered , finite size realization of the survival of the weakest effect  @xcite .",
    "the sudden decrease of the 00 population effectively reduces the 01 invasion rate what , as the name says , turns it into the only surviving strategy . differently from the model in ref .",
    "@xcite , here the crossed interactions are not direct , as discussed above .",
    "thus , even if 01 has two predators and a single prey ( 00 ) , this prey also helps by eliminating 11 , that also happens to prey on 01 .",
    "thus , these favorable conditions for 01 contribute for its persistence .",
    "when the characteristic linear size of the combined cluster 01 + 10 + 11 , that increases with @xmath5 , becomes larger than @xmath62 , it percolates and the system evolves until it is absorbed onto the state 01 . by further increasing @xmath62 , it takes a larger @xmath5 to achieve the percolation threshold , explaining the strong finite size effects observed .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the invasion graph in fig .",
    "[ fig.circ_invasion ] was obtained for the particular values @xmath103 and @xmath119 .",
    "other points inside the coexistence phase may show similar behavior albeit with some arrows reversed and strategies switching roles while keeping some of the sub - loops intransitive and the coexistence stable  @xcite .",
    "the foraging behavior of predators and the corresponding defensive response from preys is fundamental to understand how small animal communities spatially distribute , organize and eventually allow for more complex forms of sociability  @xcite .",
    "it thus becomes important , when studying simple models for such behavior , to go beyond mean field where a fully mixed , infinite size system is considered and the spatial structure , with the local correlations it implies , is missing .",
    "we considered here a finite dimensional stochastic version of the model introduced by lett et al  @xcite in which short range interactions between predators and preys are taken into account . in this way , spatial correlations that change , to some extent , the foraging behavior predicted by the replicator ( mean field ) equation , and the accompanying new dynamical behavior are introduced .",
    "the game theoretical framework for this model considers two strategies , collective or individual , for both hunting predators and defensive preys .",
    "the advantages and disadvantages of each option are modeled by a set of independent parameters from which we considered only two : how group preying efficiency is reduced against grouped preys ( @xmath5 ) and the reduction factor of lone predators ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we then study in detail this particular case , also discussed within mean field in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the limit of high population viscosity in which strategy dispersion is a slow process , solely occurring due to the newborn limited dispersal driven by the pairwise updating rule between nearest neighbors patches .",
    "the extensive simulation results presented here confirm that the overall phase diagram is essentially the same both in mean field and in finite dimension ( but infinite size ) .",
    "the combined strategies of both predators and preys present four possible states in our binary version .",
    "there are three phases in which either preys or predators ( or both ) behave collectively , ( 1,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) and ( 1,1 ) , while the ( 0,0 ) , albeit also absorbing , is not prevalent in any region of the phase diagram .",
    "instead , a coexistence phase appears with 00 sites forming a percolating background upon which compact clusters of the other strategies distribute and compete ( for the particular @xmath5 and @xmath12 used here ) .",
    "more importantly , our results unveil the underlying mechanism not only for the strategies coexistence in this phase , but also for the occurring strong finite size effects .",
    "specifically , this model is an example of an asymmetric game presenting cyclic dominance , between the above four combined strategies , in the coexistence phase .",
    "starting , say , with a 10 population of collective predators preying on lone individuals , free riders have the advantage of not having to share their preys with the other members of the group and the 00 strategy invades 10 . at this point ,",
    "if preys organize into groups they may better defend themselves , with 01 thus replacing 00 .",
    "the lone predators feel the urge to prey collectively and 11 dominates over 01 .",
    "finally , 10 invades 11 because it is better for predators to go after grouped preys , since the number of captured preys ( @xmath6 ) compensates for the loss of efficiency ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus , is better for aggregated preys to stay alone . for @xmath119 and @xmath103 , the strategies 11 , 01 , 11 form spatially extended domains whose borders are not static and move accordingly with the flow graph of fig .",
    "[ fig.circ_invasion]b .",
    "this metacluster is embedded in a sea of 00 strategies ( that are essential for coexistence because the 01 - 10 - 11 loop is transitive ) up to a size dependent value of @xmath5 where it percolates and the subsequent evolution leads to the extinction of three strategies , the surviving one being the 01 state .",
    "interestingly , since this effect is triggered by the initial reduction of the 00 strategy , the only prey of 01 , when the metacluster percolates , this effective reduction of the preying rate of 01 is the responsible for its survival , a well known effect in cyclic games , the survival of the weakest  @xcite .",
    "besides studying simple models for this less explored foraging variability , our results emphasize how important it is to study both the asymptotic states and the dynamics towards them in a finite size population .",
    "it is not possible to disentangle the strong finite size effects observed in the asymptotic state of the stochastic model from the dynamical evolution since it is the very existence of heteroclinic orbits that make the system prone to be captured by an absorbing state because of fluctuations .",
    "since actual populations are far from the thermodynamical limit , the results obtained in the mesoscopic limit become relevant .",
    "although preys rapidly converge to the asymptotic strategy , predators timescales may be very large and the transient coexistence may extend to times much larger than those that are relevant in practice .",
    "moreover , the very existence of differences between the mean field and the spatial version shows the importance of trying several complementary approaches even in the study of quite simplified models . because of the importance of the geometry of domains , it is interesting to examine their properties in more detail  @xcite .",
    "preys and predators usually engage in somewhat coordinated chase and escape interactions  @xcite that also allow them to explore and profit from neighboring patches .",
    "it is thus interesting to check whether , and to what extent , the properties of the model , in particular in the coexistence region , do change in the presence of mobile individuals . chasing and escaping behaviors may be quite complex depending on the physical and cognitive attributes of each individual and involve space and time correlations between the displacements and change in velocity of each agent  @xcite . simple movement rules , if not completely random , are likely to generate repeatable ( and , because of that , exploitable ) patterns of behavior , while those involving higher levels of variability and complexity somehow involve more advanced cognitive skills . by studying such mobility patterns",
    ", one could get a better understanding of how important the cognitive abilities are in defining hunting strategies  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these patterns are also important for the demographic distribution of both predators and preys since the shuffling of strategies , depending on how random  @xcite the mobility is , may decrease the spatial correlation and destroy local structures , changing the spatial organization of preys and predators  @xcite .",
    "several other extensions of this model are possible .",
    "for simplicity , we assumed that the size of a group is constant and homogeneous throughout the population .",
    "however , it can also be considered as a dynamical parameter coevolving along the collectivist trait .",
    "also , it would be interesting to further explore the possibilities offered by the spatial setup , for example , having heterogeneous parameters depending on the landscape ( resources may not be evenly distributed ) or due to the variability of the species .",
    "another important question is how the size of the hunters group respond to an increase or stochastic fluctuations in the size of a swarm of preys ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "although we focus here on the binary situation , it is also possible to have larger patches with enough individuals to form more than one group , such that the variables describing the local populations may now become continuous .",
    "in addition , the present model does not consider noise , a simple , effective way of taking into account some of the missing characteristics that may influence the outcome .",
    "it would thus be interesting to see how robust the results are in the presence of noise .",
    "the short - range interactions present in the model are not able to synchronize distinct regions in the coexistence phase . by introducing a fraction of long - range connections we expect global oscillations to be restored , similarly to those found in mean - field  @xcite . what is the threshold fraction of such interactions for having global oscillations and how it depends on the parameters of the model , along with the other points above , are still open questions .",
