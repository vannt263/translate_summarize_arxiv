    "we introduce an updated and largely extended version of therminator @xcite , the thermal heavy ion generator , created to carry out the statistical hadronization in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "numerous successful analyses have been performed with the help of our code over the last few years @xcite , contributing to better understanding of the involved evolution of the hot and dense system created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision .",
    "therminator 2 is a monte carlo generator written in c++ and using the standard cern root @xcite environment . that way ,",
    "apart from model applications , the code can be easily adapted for purposes directly linked to experimental data analysis , detector modeling , or estimates for the heavy - ion experiments at rhic , lhc , sps , fair , or nica .",
    "originally , therminator was designed to perform the hadronic freeze - out on simple boost - invariant hypersurfaces , such as the cracow single - freeze - out model  @xcite and the blast - wave model  @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "the code has evolved into a versatile tool , where the freeze - out profile and the expansion velocity field of any shape can be implemented , allowing application to all approaches based on statistical hadronization on a specified hypersurface .",
    "the present functionality of the code includes the following new features :    1 .",
    "an implementation of any shape of the freeze - out hypersurface and the expansion velocity field is possible now , including the 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensional profiles , in particular those generated externally with various codes for perfect hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "2 .   the hypersufraces may have space - time dependent thermal parameters , which allows for studies of non - boost - invariant systems .",
    "in particular , one may depart significantly from the mid - rapidity region to the fragmentation regions where the baryon chemical potential becomes large  @xcite .",
    "the package includes a library of `` standard '' sets of hypersurfaces and velocity profiles , which describe the au+au data @xcite at the highest rhic energy @xmath0  gev for various centralities .",
    "we also provide the hypersurfaces and velocity profiles anticipated @xcite for the lhc pb+pb collisions at @xmath1  tev , which prior to studies with the real data can be used for the modeling of detectors .",
    "4 .   a separate code , the femto - therminator ,",
    "is provided to carry out the analysis of the femtoscopic correlations .",
    "these correlations are an important source of complementary information concerning the size and expansion of the system , which should be reproduced in a realistic description of the data @xcite .",
    "we also provide several scripts that carry out auxiliary tasks :    1 .   counting the number of particles flowing back into the fireball , thus violating causality ( for realistic freeze - out profiles this number is negligible , below 1% ) .",
    "an estimate of the number of elastic collisions ( trajectory crossings ) after the freeze - out . for realistic cases",
    "this number is small ( @xmath4 for pions scattering off other pions ) , supporting the single - freeze - out approximation .",
    "3 .   visualization of the results : the particle @xmath2-spectra , the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath5 , or the hbt correlation radii .",
    "we have also made an effort to make the package more user - friendly , providing numerous examples of usage in typical situations .",
    "other codes implementing the thermal description of hadronization have also been developed recently , to mention share @xcite and thermus @xcite , computing the particle abundances , dragon @xcite , a monte carlo generator of particle production from a fragmented fireball , or hydjet++ @xcite , a heavy - ion event generator with hydrodynamics and jets .",
    "a code similar to therminator , fast hadron freeze - out generator , has been presented in refs .",
    "for the detailed description of the physics behind therminator 2 the reader is referred to the original paper @xcite . here",
    "we only wish to stress that the statistical approach to heavy - ion collisions has proved to be very useful for a very broad range of observables . with few physical input parameters , such as the temperature , chemical potentials , size , and the velocity of the collective flow ,",
    "the models describe the observed particle abundances @xcite , the transverse - momentum spectra @xcite , the balance functions @xcite , the elliptic flow coefficient @xcite , and femtoscopic observables @xcite . a uniform description of the spectra , the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath5 , and the hbt data achieved in @xcite explained for the first time the so - called `` rhic hbt puzzle '' .",
    "the key element of the success behind the statistical approach is the inclusion of the full list @xcite of hadronic resonances , whose number grows rapidly according to the hagedorn hypothesis @xcite . at the rather high temperature of the freeze - out ,",
    "@xmath6  mev , the resonances contribute very significantly to the observables .",
    "therminator 2 uses the particle data tables in the universal form originally included in the share @xcite package , and incorporates the four- * * * * and three- * * * resonances .",
    "all particles are created at the freeze - out hypersurface according to the cooper - frye formula @xcite .",
    "the two- and three - body decays of resonances , proceeding in cascades , produce the stable particles observed in the detectors .",
    "therminator offers the full space - time information on positions and velocities of the produced particles . as a monte carlo event generator written in c++ in the cern root @xcite environment ,",
    "therminator can be straightforwardly interfaced to the standard software routinely used in the data analysis of relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the lhc , rhic , sps , fair or nica .",
    "the inclusion of experimental acceptance and kinematic cuts poses no difficulty in a monte carlo generator .",
    "our starting point for the analysis of different models is the famous cooper - frye formula  @xcite .",
    "it expresses the number of hadrons being produced on the freeze - out hypersurface @xmath7 by the following integral @xmath8 where @xmath9 \\pm 1 \\right\\}^{-1 }    \\label{eqn_pdotu0}\\ ] ] is the phase - space distribution function of the particles ( the stable ones and resonances ) , and @xmath10 is the three - dimensional element of the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "the latter may be calculated with the help of the formula known from the differential geometry @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the levi - civita tensor ( @xmath13 ) and the variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are used to parametrize the three - dimensional freeze - out hypersurface submerged in the four - dimensional minkowski space .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 may be interpreted as the four - vector normal to the hypersurface with the norm equal to the `` volume of the hypersurface element '' . explicitly , @xmath17 while the remaining components are obtained via cyclic permutations of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath19 . in the following subsections",
    "we shall explicitly provide @xmath21 in the form appropriate for various considered cases .",

    "<S> we present an extended version of therminator , a monte carlo event generator dedicated to studies of the statistical production of particles in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the increased functionality of the code contains the following features : the input of any shape of the freeze - out hypersurface and the expansion velocity field , including the 3 + 1 dimensional profiles , in particular those generated externally with various hydrodynamic codes . </S>",
    "<S> the hypersufraces may have variable thermal parameters , which allows for studies departing significantly from the mid - rapidity region , where the baryon chemical potential becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> we include a library of standard sets of hypersurfaces and velocity profiles describing the rhic au+au data at @xmath0  gev for various centralities , as well as those anticipated for the lhc pb+pb collisions at @xmath1  tev . a separate code , femto - therminator , is provided to carry out the analysis of femtoscopic correlations which are an important source of information concerning the size and expansion of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we also include several useful scripts that carry out auxiliary tasks , such as obtaining an estimate of the number of elastic collisions after the freeze - out , counting of particles flowing back into the fireball and violating causality ( typically very few ) , or visualizing various results : the particle @xmath2-spectra , the elliptic flow coefficients , and the hbt correlation radii . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the problem of the back - flow of particles into the hydrodynamic region , as well as estimate the elastic rescattering in terms of trajectory crossings . </S>",
    "<S> the package is written in c++ and uses the cern root environment .    ,    </S>",
