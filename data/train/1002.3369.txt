    ", @xmath8 is the spatial correlation length upon approaching a quantum critical point @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being some arbitrary ( non - thermal ) coupling constant . knowing the value of @xmath0 is therefore of fundamental importance in the study of quantum phase transitions , especially since this critical exponent determines the appearance of the quantum critical regime at finite temperatures above the quantum critical point.@xcite such quantum critical points with an accompanying quantum critical region have been suggested to be responsible for instance for the anomalous behavior of the normal phase of high-@xmath11 cuprate superconductors",
    ". @xcite    to illustrate the effect of dissipation on the dynamical critical exponent , consider first a generic @xmath12-type non - dissipative quantum field theory",
    ". the bare inverse propagator can be obtained from the quadratic part of the action as @xmath13 , meaning that one has isotropic scaling between the spatial dimensions and the temporal dimension , _",
    "_  @xmath14 .",
    "adding local ohmic dissipation by coupling each spin to a bath of harmonic oscillators,@xcite the inverse propagator is modified to @xmath15 . assuming a phase transition to an ordered state and taking the limit @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the dissipative term @xmath18 will always dominate over the dynamic term @xmath19 , and so , by using @xmath20 , we may naively make the prediction @xmath21 .",
    "note that according to this argument , the dynamical critical exponent for a given action is independent of the spatial dimensionality of the system .",
    "we will refer to these scaling arguments as naive scaling , and postpone any discussion of caveats and other possible scaling choices to sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .    if one replaces this ohmic site dissipation with dissipation that also couples in space and not just in time , this situation may change significantly .",
    "a common form of dissipation in the context of arrays of resistively shunted josephson junctions and related models , is the ohmic dissipation of gradients , _",
    "i.e. _  of the bond variable that is the difference of the quantum phase between the superconducting elements .",
    "@xcite in fourier space this bond dissipation corresponds to an inverse propagator @xmath22 .",

    "once again letting @xmath16 , @xmath17 , we can from naive scaling expect the dissipation to be weaker than in the onsite case since in this limit @xmath23 for any positive @xmath0 .",
    "a possible value is therefore @xmath14 , for which the spatial term balances the dynamic term and dissipation can be considered perturbatively irrelevant in renormalization group sense .",
    "simple arguments of the kind given above have been the approach most commonly used whenever a dynamical critical exponent is to be determined . in recent years",
    "there has however been progress towards calculating the corrections to these lowest - order estimates for @xmath0 both by field - theoretical renormalization group methods @xcite and by monte carlo methods . @xcite",
    "in addition , there has also been considerable recent interest in dissipative systems exhibiting more exotic forms of quantum criticality where the critical exponents are varying continuously .",
    "@xcite    the most notable advance from our point of view is however the work by werner _ et al._@xcite justifying numerically the naive scaling estimate for the ising spin chain with site dissipation by extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "more precisely , it was found that the dynamical critical exponent was universal and satisfied @xmath24 , with an anomalous scaling dimension @xmath25 .",

    "the present work can therefore be regarded as a natural extension of the work done by werner _",

    "for instance , the dissipative xy model with bond dissipation is very interesting both as a model of granular superconductors or other systems which may be modeled as josephson junction arrays.@xcite in particular , such a dissipative xy model@xcite and related ashkin - teller models @xcite have been proposed to describe quantum critical fluctuations of loop - current order in cuprate superconductors .    finding a value of @xmath0 is also of considerable interest for purely classical models that include strongly anisotropic interactions .",
    "the reason is simply that performing a finite - size analysis to find the critical coupling or critical exponents requires a choice of system sizes that reflects an anisotropy in the scaling of the correlation lengths . in other words ,",
    "one ideally needs to know the relative correlation length exponent @xmath26 a priori for the finite - size analysis to be correct .    in this work ,",
    "we seek to employ monte carlo simulations of ising models to answer the following questions : 1 ) can we confirm numerically that the dynamical critical exponent is indeed independent of dimensionality ?",
    "( neglicting the assumed small @xmath27 ) 2 ) how will the dynamical critical exponent for ising variables change if one replaces the site dissipation with dissipation that also acts in space ?",

    "however , in this work we are not interested in the effect of a transverse field per se , and will therefore treat the dynamic term as a phenomenological term of unspecified origin .",

    ", we will fix the value of the dynamic coupling of the ising field to @xmath33 and vary the spatial coupling @xmath10 . for the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model@xcite",
    "this choice ensures that @xmath34 for @xmath35 , whereas in the @xmath36 case it is chosen primarily for computational convenience , and to allow for direct comparison with the @xmath37 case . for the monte carlo simulations we have used an extension of the wolff cluster algorithm@xcite by luijten and blte@xcite which very effectively treats the long - range interaction in the imaginary time direction .",
    "we have mainly used an implementation of the mersenne twister@xcite random number generator ( rng ) , but also confirmed that other rngs yielded consistent result .",
    "we also make use of ferrenberg - swendsen @xcite reweighting techniques which enable us to vary @xmath10 continuously after the simulations have been performed .",
    "we will first present the phase diagram for this model in the @xmath38-@xmath10 plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag_2d ] .",
    "the phase diagram for the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model is very similar to that for its ( 1 + 1)-dimensional counterpart , with a disorder - order phase transition for increasing dissipation and/or spatial coupling . along the @xmath38-axis",
    ", a temporally ordered state is reached at @xmath39 through a purely dissipative phase transition when @xmath40 , in which case the model is simply a collection of decoupled ( 0 + 1)-dimensional dissipative two - level systems .",
    "the long - range interaction in the temporal chains decays as @xmath41 , accordingly , the phase transition is of a kind closely related to the kosterlitz - thouless transition , @xcite in which the ordered phase consists of tightly bound kinks and antikinks .    with the same temporal coupling values as for the @xmath37 case we can with relative ease determine",
    "the critical dissipation strength @xmath42 for the independent subsystems , see the result stated in ref .  . + we have chosen a somewhat more quantitative approach to determine the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 than the one given in the presentation of werner _ et al .",
    "_ , so we will use the exposition of our results to detail the method .",
    "this method is essentially the same as the one applied by the authors of refs .   and for spin glasses in a transverse field ,",
    "but as it is rather scantily described in the literature , we include it here for completeness .",
    "the basis of our approach is as follows . for systems with isotropic scaling , a well known method to determine",
    "the value of the critical coupling is to calculate the binder ratio @xmath43 and use this to plot the binder cumulant @xmath44 as a function of coupling for several ( _ e.g. _ , cubic , in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional case ) system sizes .",
    "the binder cumulant at the critical coupling is independent of system size ( to leading order in @xmath45 ) , and the crossing point of @xmath46 for two different system sizes thus defines the ( pseudo)critical point .",
    "however , this finite - size scaling approach breaks down when the system size scales anisotropically . in this case the scaling at criticality is given as a function with two independent scaling variables instead of just one , @xmath47 and anisotropic systems according to @xmath48 are the appropriate choice instead of cubic systems .",
    "hence , given the value of @xmath0 , one should also observe data collapse as a function of @xmath49 for the binder cumulant curves at the critical point .    in order to find @xmath0 self - consistently ,",
    "we consider first the binder cumulant as a function of @xmath50 for given @xmath38 , @xmath10 and @xmath45 .",
    "for very small @xmath50 , the system appears effectively two - dimensional , and consequently the increased influence of fluctuations makes this system more disordered than the corresponding three - dimensional system . in the opposite limit of @xmath51",
    "the system appears effectively one - dimensional , and with @xmath52 the system is again disordered . as @xmath53 is a measure of the degree of order in the system , @xmath54 in both the above limits , and",
    "accordingly @xmath53 must have a maximum for some finite value @xmath55 .",
    "one way of interpreting @xmath56 is as the temporal size for which the system appears as isotropic as it possibly can be ( or optimally three - dimensional ) , the anisotropic interactions taken into account .",
    "the details of our procedure are as follows .",
    "first , we sample the binder ratio as a function of coupling @xmath10 for a large number of system sizes .",
    "for each value of @xmath45 we choose at least 14 values of @xmath50 close to the presumed peak position @xmath56 for the extent of the imaginary time dimension .",
    "the procedure for estimating @xmath0 then follows in three steps .",
    "for each @xmath10 , curves of the binder cumulant @xmath53 for all @xmath45 are plotted as a function of @xmath50 , corresponding to the plot shown in panel ( a ) of fig . [",
    "fig : finding_z ] .",
    "second , a 4th order polynomial fit is made to these curves , localizing the points @xmath57 defining the peaks of the functions @xmath58 with good precision .",
    "the obtained values for the peak binder cumulants for each @xmath45 are then plotted as a function of @xmath10 , as shown in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : finding_z ] . a value for the critical coupling @xmath59",
    "can be found by estimating the value @xmath10 to which the crossing point for two subsequent values of @xmath45 converges for @xmath60 . the third step for finding the dynamical critical exponent is a simple finite size scaling analysis of the peak positions @xmath56 of the curves @xmath58 as shown in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : finding_z ] , assuming the relation @xmath61 , with @xmath62 being a non - universal prefactor .",
    "finally , one may check the self - consistency of the obtained values for @xmath59 and @xmath0 by plotting the putative data collapse of the binder cumulant as a function of @xmath49 , _ cf . _  eq . .",
    "before moving on , we comment on the two interrelated ( subleading ) finite - size effects in the crossing point of fig .",
    "[ fig : finding_z ] : the crossing point between two subsequent binder curves moves towards lower coupling for increasing system size , and accordingly the binder cumulant at the crossing point decreases for increasing @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , the value of @xmath63 will never be independent of system size @xmath45 for finite systems .",
    "however , in our experience this vertical deviation from collapse of the binder curves - which is particularly evident when focusing on the peak of the binder curves as in our analysis - does not itself affect the finite - size estimate for @xmath0 .",
    "more important is a possible horizontal deviation .",
    "likewise , a slow convergence of the crossing points to @xmath59 complicates the determination of the critical coupling for finite systems . the resulting uncertainty in @xmath0 is dominated by this uncertainty in @xmath59 , at least for the @xmath64 case .",
    "it might be possible to obtain better precision for the critical coupling by using the finite - size analysis technique presented in ref .   for the crossing points , but in the present case with an additional ( and unknown ) finite - size effect in @xmath0",
    ", this more rigorous approach seems by no means straightforward . to ensure that finite - size effects are negligible ,",
    "we have checked the dependence of @xmath0 on the lowest value of @xmath45 included in the fitting procedure . in the analysis illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : finding_z ] , we have only retained system sizes such that the value of @xmath0 seems to have converged . for the case @xmath65 considered above , the resulting estimate is @xmath66 .",
    "no significant variation in the dynamical critical exponent is observed for stronger dissipation , and we conclude that we have @xmath2 along the critical line .",
    "however , we have not been able to determine conclusively whether or not one has exactly anomalous scaling dimension @xmath67 in the relation @xmath24 , which might be expected@xcite since the value @xmath68 lies at the upper critical dimension for this phase transition for @xmath64 .",
    "we also give an estimate of the correlation length exponent @xmath1 using the peak values @xmath69 of the binder cumulant . the leading order scaling properties of the binder ratio",
    "can be stated as@xcite @xmath70 l^{1/\\nu } ) $ ] , and assuming negligible finite - size effects in the obtained dimensions @xmath71 , one finds the finite - size relation @xmath72 the slope @xmath73 is estimated by the finite difference @xmath74 over a small coupling interval around @xmath59 , and @xmath75 is an unimportant constant . the resulting finite - size analysis for @xmath65",

    "this is very close to the expected ( mean - field ) value @xmath77 ( ref .  ) , which is reasonable given that @xmath2 .",
    "we finally note that , whereas increasing @xmath38 does not lead to a significant change of @xmath0 , it certainly does increase the prefactor @xmath62 of the scaling relation @xmath78 and thereby the peak position @xmath56 .",
    "this reflects the increased anisotropy of the interactions , and can be seen also for @xmath79 when @xmath10 and @xmath80 are allowed to vary freely . at criticality",
    "one has @xmath81 for @xmath82 , with increasing @xmath62 for increasing anisotropy @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , for the analytically solvable 2d ising model there even exists an exact mapping between system size anisotropy ( _ i.e. _  @xmath62 ) and interaction anisotropy ( _ i.e. _  @xmath84).@xcite",
    "in this section , we will consider a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional quantum ising model where the dissipative quantities of interest are bond variables involving ising spins , rather than individual ising spins themselves .",
    "the specific form of this dissipation kernel has been proposed as a candidate for describing the origin of the anomalous normal state properties of the cuprate high-@xmath11 superconductors,@xcite , but in that case involving two sets of ising spin on each lattice point . such a model , unlike the one we will consider , may be mapped onto a @xmath85-state clock model , and may be approximated by an @xmath86 model with a four - fold symmetry breaking field , which in the classical case in two spatial dimensions is perturbatively irrelevant near criticality on the disordered side . due to the degrees of freedom in our model being ising spins with a spin gap ,",
    "the present model should therefore not be regarded as directly comparable to a dissipative xy model that the authors of ref .",
    "it should rather be regarded as a simple , but spatially extended model system , illustrating how bond dissipation can affect a quantum phase transition , which is certainly an important question on its own right .    in fourier space",

    "@xmath17 we may anticipate from the fourier representation of the action that the last term becomes irrelevant , which implies the value @xmath14 for the dynamical critical exponent .",
    "it is also evident from eq . that the bond dissipation is less effective than site dissipation in reducing quantum fluctuations . while site dissipation tends to align all spins in the temporal direction , the bond dissipation tends to align the _ difference _ of nearest - neighbor spins along the trotter slices . at least in the presence of a finite coupling @xmath90",
    "this is a less effective way of reducing temporal fluctuations of individual spins than onsite dissipation .    when expanding the dissipative term , it becomes clear that it contributes to both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic long - range interaction",
    "this renders the system intractable to the luijten - blte variant cluster algorithm used in the previous section .",
    "this algorithm builds up clusters with sizes comparable to the entire system and flips these as a whole , resulting in extreme correlations.@xcite no cluster algorithm that effectively handles competing interactions has come to the authors attention .    in the monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we have therefore used a parallel tempering @xcite algorithm which adequately handles the critical slowing down in the critical regime .",
    "a number of independent systems perform random walks in the space of coupling values , and this enables the systems to effectively explore a rugged energy landscape like the one generated by the dissipation term in eq . .",
    "the coupling values are distributed according to the iteration procedure introduced by hukushima,@xcite which renders the accept ratio of the attempted exchange of two adjacent coupling values independent of the coupling value .",
    "consequently , the systems are allowed to wander relatively freely through the space of coupling values , although even more sophisticated distribution algorithms are available in that respect.@xcite    .",

    "we should however note that the approach taken here for determining the dynamical critical exponent is not applicable when @xmath0 is either strictly zero or infinite , and also for a constant value @xmath123 it would be very difficult to determine the dynamical critical exponent for practically attainable lattice sizes . if , on the other hand , one has @xmath124 in the sense of activated dynamical scaling , the method is in principle feasible.@xcite    before continuing the discussion of the bond dissipation , we comment further on the relation between the real space representation of @xmath117 and the form of the bond dissipation used in eq . . when fourier transforming @xmath125 from eq . and",
    "discretizing the resulting differential operators , we arrive at @xmath126 now , writing out the last term of eq . and comparing with eq .",
    "shows that the fourier space representation of the bond dissipation can be written as @xmath127 here , @xmath128 depends weakly on dimensions for finite systems . in other words ,",
    "the bond dissipation is of the same form as @xmath117 dissipation , but with renormalized spatial nearest neighbor coupling , which however does not alter the critical exponents of the model .",
    "this extra term originates with the counterterm introduced to cancel out the renormalization of the bare potential that arises due to the coupling with a heat bath.@xcite for the ising model , this renormalization is responsible for stabilizing ferromagnetic order at @xmath129 .",
    "we will now turn to the analysis of simulations on finite lattices , in particular with respect to the scaling relation @xmath130 and the system anisotropy expressed by it . to interpret our results",
    "it is useful to consider the dependence of both @xmath0 and @xmath62 on the dissipation strength @xmath38 , and the variation of these quantities can be understood as follows .",
    "if the dissipation term is relevant and thus determining the universality class , we may assume that the value of @xmath0 will be given by the form of this term even for infinitesimal @xmath131 in the thermodynamic limit . in this case",
    ", increasing the dissipation strength @xmath38 further will therefore not change @xmath0 , but the prefactor @xmath62 will have to change to reflect the increased interaction anisotropy .",
    "correspondingly , when the dissipation term is an irrelevant perturbation , the dynamical critical exponent will remain @xmath14 in the thermodynamic limit . upon increasing @xmath38 ,",
    "the dissipation will never grow strong enough to alter the universality class , but the non - universal prefactor @xmath62 will in general change also in this case , and whether it increases or decreases is determined by how the dissipation changes the overall interaction anisotropy .    regarding the evolution of @xmath62 upon increasing @xmath38 for the bond dissipation case , there are now two effects that must be considered separately .",
    "one implicit effect is that increasing @xmath38 decreases @xmath9 at criticality , thereby increasing the anisotropy ratio @xmath84 , which results in a much larger @xmath62 for large values of @xmath38 .",
    "the other effect is that arising explicitly from the dissipation term and its contribution to the effective coupling strength in the imaginary time direction .",
    "whereas a site dissipation term obviously increases the anisotropy when increasing the dissipation strength while keeping the other coupling values fixed , such an enhancement of @xmath62 does not appear for bond dissipation .",
    "this can be seen - as we have checked - by evaluating @xmath62 for increasing @xmath38 for isotropic short - range coupling , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath82 . one possible interpretation of this result is that although bond dissipation does not change universality , it favors @xmath132 behavior , which can also be recognized from fig .",
    "[ fig : z_vs_l_varmadiss ] . in other words",
    ", the dissipation term contributes to making the temporal dimension less ordered than the spatial dimension , in strong contrast to the case of site dissipation .",
    "this would in part explain why one needs much longer simulations and larger systems to obtain reliable results for strong bond dissipation .",
    "given that the exceedingly strong finite - size effects thwart a precise determination of @xmath0 for higher values of @xmath38 , one should in general also consider the possibility of continuously varying critical exponents .",
    "however , we have shown that @xmath3 for @xmath92 and presented solid arguments favoring that this is the case also for @xmath98 , as it is obviously also in the limit @xmath79 . therefore ,",
    "if the exponents are in fact continuously varying , they begin to vary only for dissipation strengths above @xmath133 , and would furthermore have to be varying very slowly .",
    "this work represents a further step towards simulations of physically interesting extended quantum systems with dissipation . using monte carlo methods ,",
    "we have studied a model similar to that by werner _",
    "et al._,@xcite but with higher spatial dimensionality , as well as a model with one spatial dimension but with bond dissipation instead of site dissipation .",
    "we have found that the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model with site dissipation has a dynamical critical exponent very close to the corresponding @xmath134 model , _ i.e. _",
    "bond dissipation , on the other hand , is fundamentally different , and our results strongly suggest that this form of dissipation is irrelevant to the universality class , _",
    "@xmath3 and non - varying .",
    "we therefore believe that the same dynamical critical exponent also applies to ( 2 + 1)-dimensional models with bond dissipation for the same degrees of freedom , although we have not been able to reach sufficiently large systems to show this convincingly by numerical means . in both cases , the numerical estimates for the dynamical critical exponent",
    "is consistent with those found by naive scaling arguments on the quadratic part of the action ."
