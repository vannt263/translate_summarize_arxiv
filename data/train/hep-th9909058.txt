    "the past few months have witnessed exciting progress in the study of domain walls in d=5 gravity theories .",
    "such configurations are interesting from two , on a surface orthogonal perspectives : ( i ) in the context of ads / cft correspondence such conformally flat configurations provide new insights in the study of rge flows @xcite and ( ii ) in the context of phenomenological implications , such configurations provide a framework @xcite to address the physics implications of large dimensions for the four - dimensional world on the domain wall .    within the first approach a number of conformally flat solutions were constructed and in particular the ones interpolating between supersymmetric anti - desitter ( ads ) vacua of n=8 d=5 gauged theory provide examples of static domain walls in d=5 with implications for the renormalization group flow and spectra in strongly coupled four - dimensional super yang - mills theories .",
    "one such example @xcite involves two scalar fields and thus was solved numerically and another most recent example with one scalar field can be solved explicitly @xcite .    within the second approach infinitely thin , static , @xmath2-symmetric domain wall solutions were constructed @xcite for pure ads gravity theory .",
    "( generalizations that incorporate effects of additional compactified dimensions were given in @xcite . )",
    "these solutions have to satisfy a specific relation between the domain wall tension @xmath3 and the cosmological constant @xmath4 of the ads vacua , thus implying a fine - tuning .",
    "the purpose of this letter is few - fold .",
    "we shall address a supersymmetric embedding of domain walls with asymptotically ads space - times in five - dimensions , in the simplest supergravity theory , i.e. the supergravity theory with least supersymmetry that allows for the explicit constructions of supersymmetric domain wall configurations . in order to demonstrate the existence of such domain walls , a supergravity theory necessarily has to have a potential for ( gauge neutral ) scalar fields , and the only known such examples",
    "are gauged supergravity theories and the matter fields responsible for the formation of the domain wall belongs to vector - supermultiplets .",
    "we thus choose to work within a framework of a five - dimensional n=2 , u(1 ) gauged supergravity formulated by gunaydin , townsend and sierra @xcite  .",
    "we derive the killing spinor equations for domain wall solutions . for regular solutions in this class",
    "we also derive that the energy density @xmath3 of the wall is related in a specific way to the cosmological constants of the supersymmetric vacua on each side of the wall .",
    "namely , the relationship between the domain wall tension and the cosmological constant for regular supersymmetric domain walls is a consequence of the bps nature of the solution , and not an artifact of fine - tuning  .",
    "these configurations have four unbroken supercharges , or in other words break @xmath5 of n=2 , d=5 supersymmetry , and thus the four - dimensional world on the domain wall has n=1 supersymmetry .",
    "a special example of infinitely thin supersymmetric domain walls ( corresponding to the case of very large gauge coupling ) with @xmath2 symmetry would provide a concrete supersymmetric realization of the static domain wall solution found by randall and sundrum @xcite .",
    "for the sake of concreteness we analyse the case with one physical ( gauge neutral ) vector superfield which allows for an explicit analysis of the possible domain wall configurations . for this simple model ,",
    "kink solutions have been discussed some time ago @xcite ; the domain walls presented in this paper provide a concrete and explicit realisation of supersymmetric kink solutions .",
    "the upshot of the analysis is that this framework does provide examples of static domain wall solutions that satisfy the killing spinor equations and are thus supersymmetric .",
    "the general one scalar case , however , has a potential that has at most two supersymmetric ads vacua which are always separated by at least one ( out of three ) singularity points where the potential diverges .",
    "but nevertheless the scalar for the supersymmetric domain wall solutions interpolates across the singular point .",
    "supergravity in d=5 is very restrictive with respect to allowed potentials .",
    "the only allowed potentials come from gauging of isometries and especially interesting are potentials that have no `` run - away '' behavior ( scalars become asymptotically constant ) with non - trivial isolated extrema .",
    "this type of potential allows for the existence of domain walls with extrema corresponding to the ads vacua on each side of the wall .",
    "the minimal gauged supergravity ( n=2 gauged supergravity with @xmath6 gauged @xmath7-symmetry ) , constructed in @xcite , provides such a set - up . in this case",
    "one can consistently decouple the hyper - multiplets and the lagrangian contains only the supergravity multiplet and the vector supermultiplets .",
    "( there are also domain wall solutions , that couple to non - trivial hypermultiplets @xcite , but they do not have asymptotic anti - de sitter spaces . ) in this case the bosonic lagrangian reads : @xmath8 + { 1 \\over 48 } \\int c_{ijk } f^i \\wedge f^j \\wedge a^k \\label{lag }   { \\end{equation}}we chose the convention where the five - dimensional newton 's constant is $ \\kappa=1 $ and $ g$ is the gauge coupling .",

    "the first useful observation is that in the region where the metric @xmath44 has real poles , @xmath44 has no real zeroes .",
