    "if @xmath85 is a manifold with boundary , let @xmath86 denote an open neighborhood of @xmath87 in @xmath85 .",
    "the next step in plug insertion is to remove @xmath88 from @xmath73 and glue the open lip @xmath89 to the support @xmath14 of an attachable plug @xmath5 by a leaf - preserving homeomorphism @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a neighborhood of @xmath92 .",

    "it follows by lemma  [ listrivial ] that there exists a leaf - preserving homeomorphism @xmath99 .",
    "this equivalence , together with the matched ends condition , ensures the existence of an attaching map for any attachable plug or un - plug .",
    "let @xmath80 be an insertion map of a plug @xmath5 into a foliation @xmath75 on a manifold @xmath73 , and let @xmath100 be the foliation on the manifold @xmath101 resulting from inserting @xmath5 into @xmath75 .",

    "all plugs in this paper are assumed to be untwisted unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "a plug or a semi - plug is _ aperiodic _ if it has no circular leaves .",
    "one of the main reasons to insert an aperiodic plug into another foliation is to break a circular leaf .",
    "let @xmath5 be a plug with stopped set @xmath103 and base @xmath43 , and let @xmath80 be an insertion map into a foliation @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath104 intersects a circular leaf @xmath105 of @xmath72 , then the remnant of @xmath105 in @xmath100 is an infinite leaf . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath105 is disjoint from @xmath104 but intersects @xmath106 , then there is a leaf @xmath107 in @xmath100 corresponding to @xmath105 with the same topology as @xmath105 , although the geometry of @xmath107 can differ from that of @xmath105 .",
    "the simplest interesting target for an insertion is an irrational foliation of the 3-sphere @xmath0 .",
    "given an irrational number @xmath108 , the irrational foliation of slope @xmath109 is parallel to the vector field @xmath110 on @xmath111 given by @xmath112 the foliation has two circles , and the closure of any other leaf is a torus lying between these two circles .",
    "two copies of any aperiodic plug can be inserted in small regions meeting these circles and breaking them @xcite .",
    "thus , to find a counterexample to the seifert conjecture , it suffices to construct an aperiodic plug .",
    "if the plug is smooth or analytic , the corresponding foliation of @xmath0 is respectively smooth or analytic .",
    "in 1935 , k.  borsuk @xcite gave an example of a fixed point free homeomorphism of an acyclic compact subset of @xmath113 ; a solid cylinder with two narrowing and spiraling tunnels drilled out .",
    "his example can be easily modified to obtain a semi - plug on @xmath114 ( @xmath115 is an @xmath57-cell ) with two circular leaves whose entry and exit stopped sets @xmath16 and @xmath17 are disks .",
    "a similar construction on a solid torus ( borsuk s example can be obtained by cutting or unwrapping the torus ) was given in 1952 by f.  b.  fuller @xcite .",
    "the consequence of fuller s result that @xmath116 , @xmath117 , admits a dynamical system whose only minimal set is an @xmath118-torus @xmath119 contained in a @xmath120 section motivated wilson s introduction of plugs , which he used to arrest flows globally .",
    "every smooth @xmath57-manifold of euler characteristic zero or non - compact has a smooth dynamical system with a discrete set of minimal sets .",
    "each of the minimal sets is an @xmath118-torus , and every trajectory originates ( resp . limits ) on one of these tori .",
    "[ thwilson ]    wilson s theorem implies that an analogue to the seifert conjecture for higher dimensional spheres of odd dimension is false . although wilson claimed theorem  [ thwilson ] in the smooth category , the construction is actually analytic . also , with slight modifications , wilson s construction is valid in a pl setting .",
    "wilson constructed a content - stopping , mirror - image plug and inserted many small copies of the plug into the foliation to break the leaves into small pieces .",
    "more specifically , he proved that if @xmath121 is an oriented 1-foliation of an @xmath57-manifold @xmath85 , @xmath117 , and @xmath122 is open cover of @xmath85 , then @xmath75 can be modified to an oriented 1-foliation with every leaf contained in a star of an element of @xmath122 .",
