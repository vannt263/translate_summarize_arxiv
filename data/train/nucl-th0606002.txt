    "the capture of a negative muon from the atomic @xmath2 orbit , @xmath3 is a semileptonic weak process that has been studied for a long time ( see , e.g. , the recent review @xcite or the earlier one by walecka @xcite and the classic by mukhopadhyay @xcite and the earlier references therein ) . the total capture rate has been measured for many stable nuclei ; in some cases the capture rates on separated isotopes have been also determined @xcite .    the nuclear response in muon capture",
    "is governed by the momentum transfer of the order of the muon mass .",
    "the phase space and the nuclear response favor lower nuclear excitation energies , thus the nuclear states in the giant resonance region dominate . since the experimental data are quite accurate , and the theoretical techniques of evaluating the nuclear response in the relevant regime are well developed , it is worthwhile to see to what extent the capture rates are understood globally . such a comparison may be viewed as a general test of our ability to describe semileptonic weak charged - current reactions with @xmath4 over a large range of nuclei , where @xmath5 is the momentum transfer and @xmath6 mev is the muon mass .",
    "the present work represents a first fully comprehensive theoretical evaluation of the total muon capture rate over the full range of nuclei where the experimental data are available .",
    "previously , the muon capture rates for selected nuclei encompassing , however , a broad range of atomic charges , were calculated in ref . @xcite . that paper was devoted mostly to the description of the radiative muon",
    "capture , and the total muon capture rates were a byproduct with only a limited agreement with the data .",
    "more along the lines of the present approach , ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used a hatree - fock random phase approximation method and obtained good agreement with experiment , however only for a limited selection of nuclei .",
    "the local fermi gas model was used successfully for the evaluation of the muon capture rate in selected nuclei in ref .",
    "@xcite , and more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present work is an extension of previous papers devoted to this issue @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the capture rates for @xmath7c , @xmath8o and @xmath9ca were evaluated using the continuum random phase approximation , and a very good agreement with the total rate was obtained .",
    "however , the residual interaction employed in @xcite was adjusted to describe other observables in the cases of @xmath7c and @xmath8o .",
    "moreover , it was necessary to quench the gamow - teller like ( gt ) partial capture rate leading to the @xmath10 ground state of @xmath7b . in the later ref .",
    "@xcite heavier nuclei with @xmath11 , @xmath12ca , @xmath13fe , @xmath14zr , and @xmath15pb were also included with a similar success . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has also been shown that for the calculation of muon capture rates the standard random phase approximation ( srpa ) is essentially equivalent to the more computationally demanding continuum random phase approximation .",
    "thus , the srpa method is also used in the present study . in ref .",
    "@xcite the srpa approach has been used to study the muon capture rates to a long chain of calcium and tin isotopes .",
    "one of the important issues when evaluating the response of nuclei to weak probes of relatively low energies is the problem of quenching of the corresponding strength .",
    "the evidence for quenching comes primarily from the analysis of the beta decay of the @xmath16 shell @xcite as well as @xmath17 shell @xcite nuclei . in addition",
    ", the interpretation of the forward angle @xmath18 and @xmath19 charge - exchange reactions @xcite leads to the same conclusion .",
    "all such evidence , so far , is restricted to the gt strength and relatively low excitation energies .",
    "a convenient and customary way to account for this quenching is to use an ` effective ' axial - vector coupling constant @xmath20 , reducing it from its nominal value of @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "the evaluation of the muon capture rate , reported here , suggests that the quenching of @xmath20 is not needed to describe these data .",
    "( that conclusion was already reached in refs.@xcite . ) as stressed above , the mean excitation energy in muon capture is in the region of giant resonances of about 15 mev ( slowly decreasing with @xmath0 or @xmath23 ) , and the gt - like operators contribute very little in heavier nuclei where the neutrons and protons are in different oscillator shells . in lighter nuclei , for @xmath24 and @xmath23 less than 40 ,",
    "the gt strength contributes , and is concentrated at low energy .",
    "thus , in agreement with the evidence mentioned above , we quench this , and only this , part of the transition strength by a common factor @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the present work , and the evaluation of the muon capture in general , makes it possible to extend the study of quenching to higher multipoles , and correspondingly to higher nuclear excitation energies .",
    "such processes , typically , depend primarily on the positions of the corresponding giant resonances and on the overall strength .",
    "our conclusions , therefore , show that the srpa method involving correlated particle - hole excitations , is capable of describing the inclusive semileptonic processes with momentum transfer @xmath5 of order @xmath1 quite well .",
    "this is an important conclusion , applicable to a variety of practically important subjects , e.g. detection of supernova neutrinos or evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements for neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the challenge of evaluating the muon capture rate in a wide variety of nuclei made it necessary to include several effects that were not usually included in analogous calculations .",
    "since we needed to describe the bound muon in the @xmath2 orbit well , we went beyond the usual calculation of the muon density at the site of the nucleus .",
    "first , we solved the dirac equation in the field of the finite size nucleus numerically .",
    "we then used its wave function , taking into account that it is not constant between the origin and the nuclear surface . for high @xmath23 values",
    "the muon is relativistic , and the ` small ' @xmath26 component of its wave function is nonnegligible .",
    "as explained below , we used here ( for the first time ) the additional transition matrix elements associated with that component .",
    "since our goal is to describe muon capture in all nuclei ( except the very light ones ) we have to desribe , at least crudely , effects associated with the partial filling of the single - particle subshells for nuclei that do not have magic numbers of protons and/or neutrons . as described in the next section , we describe these effect by taking into account the smearing of the proton and neutron fermi levels caused by pairing and deformation .",
    "it appears that this simplified treatment of complicated correlations , including those caused by deformation , is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "in this calculation we have used the standard rpa model to describe the nuclear excitations . in a previous work ( @xcite ) this model was shown to be just as good as the computationally more involved continuum rpa . as residual interaction we use the phenomenological landau - migdal force . for low mass nuclei",
    "the parameters for the force were taken from ref .",
    "this choice was shown to be accurate in @xcite .",
    "for muon capture the most important term in the landau - migdal force is the spin - isospin coupling constant g. in @xcite the value g=0.7 is recommended , however , in a recent review @xcite g=0.96 is used for heavy nuclei . to accommodate this variation",
    ", we use an interpolation formula with a mild @xmath0 dependency : @xmath27 where the constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 are fitted to yield g=0.7 in @xmath8o and g=0.96 in @xmath15pb .",
    "we note that the change in the total capture rate in going from g=0.7 to g=0.96 is less than 10% .    to get a basis of single - particle states we diagonalize a woods - saxon potential ( wsp ) in a harmonic oscillator basis of more than 8 major shells , thus enabling us to always have an excess of 2@xmath30 of valence space above the fermi level for both protons and neutrons . as parameters of the wsp we use @xmath31 fm for the radius and @xmath32 fm for the diffuseness .",
    "the spin - orbit term is given as the derivative of the wsp times a strength @xmath33 .",
    "here we have simply used a fixed value of @xmath34 through - out , initially checking that other choices did not significantly effect the total capture rate . to find the overall strength of the wsp",
    ", we fixed the last proton and neutron particle energies to experimentally known masses . more specifically , for a nucleus ( a , z ) we found the energy of the last proton level from the proton separation energy @xmath35 in ( a , z ) .",
    "for the last neutron level we used the neutron separation energy @xmath36 , but this time in the daughter ( a , z-1 ) .    in order to be able to handle open - shell nuclei",
    "we have previously used a simple scheme where partial occupancies was treated by multiplying the open level matrix elements by occupation numbers corresponding to an independent particle model  @xcite . in this work",
    "we have attempted to improve on this treatment by solving the standard bcs equations to determine the occupation numbers .",
    "following ref.@xcite the occupation probabilities are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the single - particle energies and the chemical potential @xmath39 is fixed by the condition @xmath40 .",
    "the pairing gap @xmath41 is obtained by the procedure descibed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the formalism used to evaluate the total muon capture rate is that of ref .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we treat the muon wavefunction by solving the dirac equation in the extended charge of the nucleus , which is assumed to be of the woods - saxon form with the same paramteres as above . for nuclei with large values of @xmath23 ,",
    "the atomic binding energy becomes a significant fraction of the muon rest mass and the small component of the dirac bi - spinor may not be negligble in this range .",
    "we therefore explicitly include all terms containing both large and small components in our transition operators .",
    "an outline of the complications arising from this is given in the appendix .",
    ", the calculated rates with all corrections ( empty circles @xmath42 ) , and the calculated rates without the bcs and relativistic corrections ( diamonds @xmath43 ) .",
    "the insert , in larger scale , shows the same results for light nuclei .",
    "when the measurements are for the natural abundance of a given element , the calculation represent the corresponding combination of the individual isotopes.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    our calculated total muon capture rates for all nuclei for which measured values exist are shown in figure  [ fig : final ] .",
    "one sees that the overall agreement is quite good . with the exceptions at @xmath44 and @xmath45 the calculations reproduce the experimental values to 15% or better . in figure  [",
    "fig : ratio ] we provide a ratio plot where the degree of agreement is better seen .",
    "in addition , in table [ tab : rates ] we collect all our calculated capture rates , including the results for individual isotopes .",
    ".calculated rates for natural elements and for the important individual isotopes .",
    "all rates are in the form @xmath46 s@xmath47 .",
    "if the natural abundance has more than 90% of a given isotope then the nuc column gives this particular isotope and the calculation is done for this nucleus only .",
    "whenever a nucleus has the superscript @xmath48 the calculation is a weighted combination of all isotopes contributing more than 10% to the natural abundance .",
    "an empty experiment box means that the given isotope has not been measured .",
    "natural abundance measurements appear in the box next to the most abundant isotope .",
    "experimental data are from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the original sources may be found .",
    "@xmath49 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath50 is from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath51 is from ref . @xcite [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] the total capture rates are also compared with values obtained from calculations where the bcs occupancy and the relativistic corrections are turned off . from this comparison",
    "it is clear that these are only small corrections , providing justification for the calculation done in ref .",
    "@xcite . at low @xmath23 one especially notices the good reproduction of the distinct dips in the rates above the magic numbers @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for @xmath54",
    "the same trends is visible in both calculation and experiment , but the calculations overshoot the experimental values somewhat . just above @xmath55 , where the @xmath56 closed neutron shell comes into play , we also overestimate the capture rates .",
    "this continues into the region with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and also , to a lesser extent , to the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath15pb .",
    "one should remember that some of the nuclei above @xmath54 and below @xmath57 are deformed and thus have different single - particle structures than the ones given by our spherical mean - field model , thus a perfect agreement should not be expected .",
    "the fact that the calculated values are again approaching experiment at th , u and pu is likely a consequence of the same dip after the magic shell closure that was seen at lower @xmath23 also ( these trends were also noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , see in particular figure 3 of that reference ) .",
    "as stated above , we use the unquenched value for the axial - vector coupling constant for all multipole operators , except for the true gamow - teller transition . for most of the light- and medium - mass nuclei , @xmath58 ( dipole - like ) and @xmath59 ( quadrupole - like ) transitions dominate .",
    "however , for @xmath15pb and the heavier nuclei , @xmath60 transitions contribute significantly to the total capture rate .",
    "for these nuclei , the neutron excess is already so large that , in the simple independent particle model , 2 major oscillator shells have to be overcome when changing a proton into a neutron in the muon capture process .",
    "thus , for these excitations the @xmath60 multipole transition corresponds to a 2@xmath61 mode and not to a ( 0 @xmath61 ) gamow - teller transition ; the contribution of the latter to the rate in the heavy nuclei vanishes in our calculations .",
    "we have not renormalized the axial - vector coupling constant for such 2 @xmath30 @xmath10 transitions , supported by the good agreement of the the calculated capture rates with the measured results for the heavy nuclei .        an important test of the ability of a nuclear structure model to reproduce the data is the dependence of the muon capture rate on the number of neutrons for a fixed nuclear charge @xmath23 .",
    "typically , the rate decreases with increasing @xmath24 ( or @xmath0 ) as subsequently more neutron levels are getting blocked .",
    "this effect is incorporated into the well - known primakoff parametrization by its ( n - z ) dependence @xcite . as examples , table [ tab : rates ] include three isotope chains of nuclei ( ca , cr , and ni ) , where total capture rates for individual isotopes have been measured .",
    "one sees that the isotope dependence is well reproduced by our calculations .",
    "analogous calculations were performed in ref  .",
    "the present analysis shows that the standard random phase approximation method is capable of describing quite well the total @xmath62 capture rates for essentially all stable nuclei . the dependence of the capture rate on the isospin , or neutron excess , the so - called primakoff rule @xcite , is also fairly well , albeit not perfectly , reproduced .",
    "our calculation even describes the rather subtle effects of shell closures when considering the dependence of the capture rate on @xmath23 and/or @xmath0 .",
    "there is no indication of the need to apply any quenching to the operators responsible for the muon capture , in particular those involving single - particle transitions from one oscillator shell to another , i.e. other than those involving @xmath63 spin and isospin changing operators .",
    "given the task of describing the capture in a variety of nuclei , including those with high charge @xmath23 and nuclei with unfilled shells , it became necessary to consider several effects that have not been typically included previously .",
    "one of them is a fully relativistic treatment of the muon bound state , including the effects associated with the ` small ' @xmath26 component of its wave function .",
    "another one is the effect of the smearing of the fermi level ( both for protons and neutrons ) in nuclei that have nonmagic @xmath23 or @xmath24 numbers . even though the corresponding corrections are not very large , they contribute noticeably to the overall good agreement between the experimental data and our calculated values .",
    "our findings then can be used as guidance in the evaluation of a wide variety of semileptonic weak processes on nuclei with similar momentum transfer .",
    "one of us ( p.v . ) gratefully acknowledges the hospitality at gsi , where part of this work was done .",
    "in this appendix we give an outline of terms arising from the inclusion of the fully relativistic treatment of the bound muon wave function , i.e. , of both the large and small components .",
    "the muon wavefunction we use has the form @xmath64 where the radial functions satisfy the equations @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the large and small components , respectively . here",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 these equations are entirely general and can be found in e.g. ref . @xcite . since we assume that the muon is captured from the atomic @xmath2 orbit we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 . since @xmath71 is non - zero",
    ", we can no longer just multiply the wavefunction with the irreducible nuclear operators and obtain good total angular momentum .",
    "if the positive z - axis is chosen along the direction of the out - going neutrino then its wavefunction becomes @xmath72 here @xmath73 are the usual spin down pauli two - spinors and n is a normalization given in @xcite .",
    "this wavefunction makes the neutrino purely left - handed as the standard model prescribes .",
    "the approach used in @xcite neglects the small component in the muon wave function and expands the neutrino plane wave in multipoles .",
    "as the large component has @xmath69 , angular momentum coupling of the muon wave function and the multipole operators is quite straightforward .",
    "this is , however , no longer the case if the small component with orbital angular momentum @xmath74 is considered , implying the need for a cumbersome recoupling of angular momenta to regain tensor operators that can be applied in the nuclear hilbert space .",
    "this results in a more complicated expression for the weak hamiltonian governing muon capture with several new terms . in the notation used in @xcite the hamiltonian with all terms from both components",

    "<S> we use the random phase approximation to systematically describe the total muon capture rates on all nuclei where they have been measured . </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce the experimental values on these nuclei to better than 15% accuracy using the free nucleon weak form factors and residual interactions with a mild @xmath0 dependency . </S>",
    "<S> the isospin dependence and the effects associated with shell closures are fairly well reproduced as well . </S>",
    "<S> however , the calculated rates for the same residual interactions would be significantly lower than the data if the in - medium quenching of the axial - vector coupling constant is employed to other than the true gamow - teller amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation thus suggests that no quenching is needed in the description of semileptonic weak processes involving higher multipole transitions and momentum transfer @xmath1 , with obvious importance to analogous weak processes .    </S>",
