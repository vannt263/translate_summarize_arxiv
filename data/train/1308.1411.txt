    "@xcite discovered a broadening of the jet opening angle at @xmath7100  @xmath9 from the radio core with an edge - brightened structure , and this was later confirmed in several works  @xcite .",
    "more recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter an12 ) discovered a maintanance of a parabolic structure between a few @xmath13 and @xmath14 from the core with a transition into a conical streamline above a location of @xmath15 .",
    "these results provide compelling evidence that the collimation region is beginning to be resolved near the base of this jet .",
    "however , the jet structure within @xmath7100@xmath16 remains unclear .",
    "probing the innermost region is essential to directly test theoretical models of relativistic jet formation . because the radio core at the jet base corresponds to an optically - thick surface of synchrotron emission  @xcite ,",
    "previous studies were not possible to determine the location of the central engine relative to the radio core , preventing them from estimating the exact collimation profile in this region .",
    "recently , we have overcome this difficulty  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h11 ) .",
    "by measuring the core position shift  @xcite with multi - frequency phase - referencing very - long - baseline - array ( vlba ) observations , we have constrained the location of the central engine of the m87 jet as @xmath720@xmath16 upstream of the 43-ghz core .",
    "this allows us to probe the radial profile of the jet structure as a function of the distance from the central engine .",
    "moreover , the determination of the frequency dependence of the core position @xmath17 enables us to reveal the structure of the innermost jet by investigating the multi - frequency properties of the core . indeed , the recent vlbi observation of m87 at 230  ghz detected a compact core which is comparable to the size of event horizon  @xcite , being consistent with the core of this jet to be located in the black hole vicinity .",
    "in this paper , we explore the collimation profile of the inner jet of m87 , especially based on the multi - frequency properties of the vlbi core as well as the edge - brightened jet .",

    "we observed m87 with vlba at 2 , 5 , 8.4 , 15 , 23.8 and 43  ghz on 2010 april 8 and 18 .",
    "these are the same data presented in h11 , where we investigated the core shift of m87 using the phase - referencing technique relative to the nearby radio source m84 .",
    "details of the observations and the data reductions processes are described in h11 .    to better constrain the averaged multi - frequency properties of the core and the inner jet",
    ", we also analyzed vlba archival data at 8.4 , 15 , 23.8 and 43  ghz .",
    "we selected data observed after 2009 with sufficiently good qualities ( all 10 stations participated , good @xmath19-coverages , and thus high angular resolutions obtained ) . initial data calibration before imaging was performed using the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) astronomical image processing system ( aips ) based on the standard vlbi data reduction procedures .",
    "these data were not acquired with phase - referencing mode .",
    "moreover , we added one vlba archival data set at 86  ghz , which allows us to probe the inner jet even closer to the black hole because of its higher transparency and resolution .",
    "while several vlba observations of m87 have been performed at 86  ghz , we selected the data observed in 2007 february , because this is the only 86  ghz data at present for which a reliaiable self - calibrated image has been published with vlba alone ( peak - to - noise ratio of the self - calibrated image higher than @xmath770 ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the observation is operated at 8 stations without saint - croix and hancock .",
    "we analyzed this data based on the procedures described in their paper .",
    "images were created in difmap software with iterative phase / amplitude self - calibration .",
    "we used uniform weighting scheme to produce high resolution images .",
    "the m87 jet was clearly detected for all of the analyzed data . in figure  1",
    "we show a representative image of m87 at 43  ghz , which was made by stacking the seven sets of data .",
    "we confirmed the jet to be characterized by the compact core with the edge - brightened structure directing an overall position angle of p.a.@xmath7290@xmath20 .      in the present study",
    ", we aim at measuring the width of the innermost jet . for this purpose , we fitted a single elliptical gaussian model to each image with the aips task jmfit , and derived deconvolved parameters of the core region .",
    "note that the derived gaussian size in this simple modeling could yield a larger size than that of the true core ( i.e. , optical depth @xmath21 surface ) in the jet propagation direction , because of blending of the optically - thin jet part .",
    "also in the transverse direction to the jet axis , this method would give a total size of the true core plus surrounding emission , if the core region has a sub - structure that is not resolved by vlba baselines in this direction  @xcite .",
    "however , here we are interested in measuring such a entire width of the innermost jet .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "most of the derived values ( especially for minor axes ) are smaller than the beam size for each data .",
    "nonetheless , it is known that such sizes are measurable when the emitting region is sufficeintly bright and robust self - calibration using as many as 10 vlba stations ( 8 at 86  ghz ) can calibrate the fringe visibilities accurately . for the m87 core ,",
    "the derived sizes along the minor axes at 5 , 8.4 , 15 , 23.8 , 43 and 86  ghz correspond to amplitude decreases of 15% , 18% , 25% , 30% , 33% and 30% at @xmath760% of the longest baseline ( 80m@xmath22 , 140m@xmath22 , 240m@xmath22 , 380m@xmath22 , 700m@xmath22 and 1100m@xmath22 respectively , which yield effective angular resolutions in @xmath23 ) .",
    "these decreases are sufficiently larger than a typical vlba amplitude calibration accuracy of @xmath75% ( analogous discussion is presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at 86  ghz ,",
    "previous global - millimeter - vlbi - array observations report similar sizes to the present value in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ( @xmath24  @xmath25as or @xmath26  @xmath25as ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "we estimated the standard errors of the derived gaussian parameters for each data as follows .",
    "formally , statistical size uncertainties purely based on snr  ( size of the fitted model devided by its peak - to - noise ratio ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) results in very small values for m87 ( a level of a few @xmath25as or smaller ) because the core is bright at each frequency ( peak - to - noise @xmath27 ) .",
    "however in practice , the model parameters are more strongly affected by imperfect clean / deconvolution processes under limited @xmath19-coverages .",
    "then , we devided each individual data set into three subsets with equal integration time , and repeated deconvolution and jmfit processes for each data individually . through this procedure",
    ", we obtained three sets of quasi - independent fitting results for each epoch , and the rms scatters can be calculated for each parameter ( i.e. , major / minor axes and p.a . ) .",
    "these scatters are adopted as realistic errors for each model parameter in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .    as an additional check",
    ", we conducted a fake visibility analysis to examine how precisely sizes smaller than beam sizes can be recovered  ( a similar analysis is described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; using the aips task uvcon , we created fake visibilities which are equivalent to the derived gaussian parameters at each frequency with similar @xmath19-coverages of the actual observations .",
    "we produced 10 independent visibility data sets at each frequency by adding random noises at a level seen in the actual observations , repeated clean / deconvolution and jmfit on each data , and calculated rms scatters of the recovered model parameters at each frequency .",
    "we confirmed that these scatters were smaller than one - third of the quoted errors in table  [ tab : tab1 ] at frequencies smaller than 43  ghz , and less than one - half at 86  ghz .",
    "we note that , only regarding the minor axis of the 2-ghz core , jmfit derived a quite small size ( less than 15% of the beam size ) , which indicates a marginal constraint .",
    "so in table  [ tab : tab1 ] we instead set one - fifth of the beam size as an upper limit , which corresponds to @xmath75% amplitude decrease at the longest baseline in this direction .    .",
    "two lines are power - law fit to each distribution using 8.4 , 15 , 23.8 and 43  ghz data .",
    "a gray rectangle indicates the derived core size at 230  ghz  @xcite . ]        in figure  [ fig : coresize ] , we show a gaussian size projected along @xmath28 as a function of frequency ( hereafter we denote @xmath0 ) is defined as a fwhm of the derived ellipical gaussians when sliced along a position angle of @xmath29 i.e. , @xmath30^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath31 and p.a .",
    "indicate values in columns ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) of table  1 .",
    "the errors in this direction , shown in column ( g ) of table  [ tab : tab1 ] , are calculated from usual error propagation analysis using the errors @xmath31 and p.a .. ] .",
    "this projection is perpendicular to an overall jet axis , correnponding to a direction of the jet width .",
    "we found @xmath2 to be clearly frequency dependent , becoming smaller as frequency increases . to determine an averaged frequency dependence of @xmath2 , we fitted a power law function to this plot using the data at 5 , 8.4 , 15 , 23.8 , 43 and 86  ghz ( 2  ghz data are excluded because of upper limits ) .",
    "we found the best - fit solution to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "interestingly , when this frequency dependence is extended toward higher frequency , its extrapolated size appears to result in a similar value to the measured size by the recent 230  ghz vlbi experiment  @xcite , which is determined with a circular gaussian fit . for reference",
    ", we also show a gaussian size distribution projected along a jet propagation direction , but this does not seem to fit the 230  ghz core size .      in figure  [",
    "fig : jetwidth ] , we show the radial profile of the m87 jet width as a function of ( de - projected ) distance along jet ( assuming a jet inclination angle @xmath34 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we investigated the jet width profile in the following two procedures : ( 1 ) measurements of @xmath35 ; for the region where the jet is clearly resolved into a two - humped shape at each frequency , we made transverse slices of the jet every 0.01@xmath70.5  mas distance along the jet , and each of the two - humped structure was fitted by a double - gaussian function .",
    "we then defined the separation between the outer sides of the half - maximum points of the two gaussains as jet width .",
    "when the jet at a frequency becomes single - humped toward the upstream region , we measured the jet width using higher frequency images because the jet is clearly resolved again into a two - humped shape at higher resolutions . by using the images between 2 and 43  ghz",
    ", such a measurement was repeated over a distance of @xmath710@xmath36  @xmath8 down to @xmath7100  @xmath9 along the jet .",
    "this process is basically the same as that used in an12 , but we exclude measurements for the single - humped region .",
    "we aligned radial positions of @xmath35 profiles between different frequencies by adding the amount of core shift measured in h11 ( described below ) .",
    "this amount and the associated position error at each frequency provide only tiny fractions of the distance where @xmath35 was measured at each frequency ( a level of @xmath37 at 43  ghz to @xmath38 at 2  ghz ) , so horizontal error bars for @xmath35 are removed in figure  [ fig : jetwidth ] . at 86  ghz , we could not perform reliable measurements of the jet width because the edge - brightened jet was only marginally imaged at a level of ( 23)@xmath39 .",
    "( 2 ) measurements of @xmath6 ; closer to the central engine , we further constructed a radial distribution of @xmath2 . because our previous astrometric study h11 measured locations of the cores as 41 , 69 , 109 , 188 , 295 and 674  @xmath25as at 43 , 23.8 , 15 , 8.4 , 5 and 2  ghz from the convergence point of the core shift ( in r.a .",
    "direction or p.a@xmath40 ) , we can set their de - projected distances along the jet ( p.a.@xmath41 ) as 24 , 40 , 63 , 108 , 170 and 388  @xmath9 for @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "for 86/230  ghz cores , we can also set their de - projected positions as 12 and 5  @xmath9 by assuming the same asymptotic relation ( @xmath42 ; h11 ) for the upstream of the 43  ghz core .",
    "here we assume that the central engine is located at the convergence point of the core shift specified in h11 .",
    "we confirmed that the edge - brightened region is well - expressed as a parabolic structure of @xmath43 ( solid line in figure  3 ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with their finding @xmath44 in an12 . for the region around @xmath7100  @xmath9 , where the independent measurements of @xmath45 and @xmath2 are overlapped each other , @xmath2 at 5 and 8,4  ghz smoothly connect with @xmath45 at 43  ghz .",
    "the combination of the core size ( @xmath46 where @xmath47 ) and core position ( @xmath48 where @xmath49 ; h11 ) yields a radial dependence of @xmath2 as @xmath50 ( dotted line in figure  3 ) , which is slightly steeper than that of the outer jet @xmath35 , although the uncertainty is still large . in the present result ,",
    "it is still difficult to distinguish whether @xmath2 at 5 , 8.4 , 15 and 23.8  ghz are on the solid line or the dashed line due to their position uncertainties in addition to those of sizes . on the other hand , @xmath2 at 43 and 86  ghz tends to be below the solid line . at 230  ghz",
    ", the exact profile can not be discriminated again because the data is totally dominated by its position uncertainty .",
    "we note that the two methods used for @xmath35 ( a double - gaussain fit on each slice image ) and @xmath6 ( based on a single two - dimensional elliptical gaussian model on each 2-d image ) are different from each other .",
    "nevertheless , the observed consistencies of the values between the two methods were confirmed in the overlapped region , indicating that @xmath2 is actually a good tracer for the width of the innermost jet region .",
    "probing the collimation profile of the m87 jet is crucial to understand the formation processes of relativistic jets . although the actual energetics of the m87 jet is still under debate  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , here we focus on the framework of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) jets , because it is widely explored as the most successful scenario for jet production .",
    "theoretically , the shape of a magnetized jet is determined by the detailed force balance across the poloidal field lines .",
    "this is described as the trans - field equation , which was originally derived by @xcite for steady , axisymmetric , rotating magnetized flow in a gravitational field without external pressure .",
    "later , it is invoked that magnetic hoop stresses associated with toroidal field lines play a major role to realize a global collimation of a magnetized jet  @xcite .",
    "here we observationally confirmed that the m87 jet is well characterized as a parabolic collimation profile between @xmath7100 and @xmath710@xmath52 .",
    "this is consistent with the prior work by an12 , where they also found a transition into a conical shape above @xmath7@xmath53 .",
    "regarding formation of a parabolic shape , recent theoretical studies indicate the importance of external pressure support at the jet boundary .",
    "@xcite analytically showed that hoop stresses alone would not realize global collimation , and numerical studies also come along this line  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite shows that when the external gas pressure follows @xmath54 where @xmath55 , the jet maintains parabolic as @xmath56 , whereas for @xmath57 the jet eventually becomes conical due to insufficient external support . if the observed radio emission of m87 traces the exterior edge of a magnetized jet , the measured width profile suggests @xmath58 . as a source of such confinement medium ,",
    "an12 propose an intersteller medium bounded by the gravitational influence of the central black hole , such as a giant adaf  @xcite .",
    "we add to note that a purely hydrodynamic ( hd ) jet is also possible to produce the gradual parabolic collimation of m87  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , at the end of the collimation region , both an12 and @xcite suggest hst-1 ( a peculiar knot at a deprojected distance @xmath59120  pc or @xmath60 ) as a stationary shocked feature resulting from overcollimation of the inner jet , which is originally proposed by @xcite and @xcite to explain the broadband flaring activity .",
    "while our recent kimematic observations of hst-1 shows clear evidence of superluminal motions of the overall structure , a weak , slowly - moving feature is also found in the upstream of hst-1  @xcite , which indeed could be related to a recollimation shock .",
    "for the first time , we have revealed a detailed collimation profile down to @xmath62 by investigating the multi - frequency properties of the radio core .",
    "an intriguing point here is that the measured collimation profile suggests a possible tendency of a wider jet opening angle around @xmath710 to @xmath7100  @xmath8 from the central engine .",
    "since the two methods of our width measurements are switched around @xmath63 , one could speculate that the profile change is related to some systematic effects due to the different methods .",
    "then , to check the two - humped jet shape further close to the core ( @xmath64 ) more clearly , we created a 43-ghz image convolved with a slightly higher resolution ( a circular beam of 0.14  mas diameter ) .",
    "the image is shown in figure 4 . above @xmath70.4",
    "mas downstream of the core ( de - projected distance @xmath7220  @xmath9 for @xmath34 ) , where the jet is parabolic on logarithmic distance , the two ridges are already oriented into a similar direction ( dark - blue region in figure 4 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the opening angle made by the two ridges appear to broaden more rapidly within @xmath70.3  mas of the core ( the region with contours in figure 4 ) , resulting in a more radially - oriented structure near the base .",
    "such a tendency is consistent with the observed possible transition from the solid line to the ( steeper ) dashed line around @xmath63 in figure 3 .",
    "a transition of jet collimation profile near the black hole is actually suggested from some of theoretical aspects . in the framework of relativistic mhd jet models ,",
    "most of the energy conversion from magnetic - to - kinetic occurs after the flow passes through the fast - magnetosonic point  (  magnetic nozzle  effect ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . beyond this point ,",
    "the magnetized jet starts to be collimated asymptotically into a parabolic shape , because the increasing plasma inertia winds the field lines into toroidal directions and thus amplifies the hoop stresses  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the radius of the fast point is typically a few times the light cylinder radius @xmath65  @xcite , where @xmath66 is of the order of ( 1@xmath75 )  @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "thus , if the m87 jet is magnetically launched , the observed possible transition of the jet shape around @xmath67 could be explained by this process .",
    "moreover , the jet in this scale is likely to have complicated interactions with surrounding medium such as accretion flow , corona and disk wind  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their geometries and the local pressure balance at the jet boundary would affect the initial jet shape .",
    "alternatively , such a change of the jet shape could happen as an apparent effect due to projection , if the jet inclination angle is not constant down to the black hole  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that a time - averaged dependence @xmath68 of @xmath0 appears to connect with the 230  ghz core size .",
    "however , this apparent connection should be compared in a cautious manner ; the @xmath19-coverage used in @xcite yields the highest ( @xmath73000m@xmath22 ) angular resolution _ along _ the jet direction for m87 , while @xmath75 times shorter projected baselines transverse to the jet .",
    "thus the derived size of @xmath740  @xmath25as by their circular gaussian fit could be more weighted to the structure along the jet , unless the brightness pattern of the jet base ( when projected toward us ) is actually close to a circular shape . to clarify the exact relationship of the core size at the higher frequency side , the addition of north - south baselines in the future event - horizon - telescope array is crucial , which can be realized by including chilean stations such as aste , apex and alma  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here have newly shed light on the crucial issues which should be addressed more rigorously in future observations ; where is the exact location of the profile change between @xmath710 and @xmath7100  @xmath9 and how does it change ( e.g. , a sharp break or a gradual transition ) ?",
    "in addition , simultaneous observations at multiple frequencies are important ; a dynamical timescale of our target region is an order of @xmath69  days , so the jet structure ( size and position of the core ) can be variable on this timescale  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . to address these issues",
    ", we are currently conducting new high - sensitivity vlba observations at 86  ghz in combination with quasi - simultaneous sessions at lower frequencies , which allows more robust investigations of the jet structure within @xmath13 and thus test some specific models more quantitatively .",
    "finally , we also stress the significance of future imaging opportunities with radioastron at 22  ghz or global - vlbi at 43/86  ghz including alma baselines , because these will provide images at drastically improved resolutions , especially in the direction transverse to the m87 jet .",
