    "the hexagonal @xmath2mno@xmath0 [ @xmath2 = ho , er , tm , yb , lu , y ; space group @xmath3 compounds belong to the class of ferroelectromagnet materials characterized by the coexistence of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and ferroelectric ( fe ) orderings @xcite .",
    "the fe and afm transitions are well separated in temperature with curie and nel temperatures being @xmath4  k and @xmath5  k , and only weak coupling of the two respective order parameters is expected .",
    "such coupling do exist in @xmath2mno@xmath0 materials . for ymno@xmath0 , for instance , anomalies in the dielectric constant and loss tangent near @xmath6 @xcite and an additional antiferromagnetic contribution to the non - linear optical polarizability below @xmath6 @xcite were found experimentally .",
    "furthermore , a number of magnetic transitions at lower temperatures ( below t@xmath1 ) were established for homno@xmath0 due to both mn in-@xmath7-plane and ho @xmath8-axis ordering@xcite .",
    "the raman scattering is also determined by non - linear terms of polarizability , which may be affected by afm - fe and/or spin - phonon couplings . in the case of strong couplings",
    "the raman spectra should exhibit anomalies at magnetic transition temperatures .",
    "anomalous raman scattering due to two - magnon processes was recently reported for ymno@xmath0@xcite , but not confirmed in more recent studies @xcite .",
    "all theses facts give a motivation for a more thorough study of lattice vibrations of hexagonal manganites as a function of temperature through raman scattering and infrared spectroscopies .    in this paper",
    "we report the polarized raman and infrared reflection spectra of homno@xmath0 single crystals in a broad temperature range . pronounced phonon anomalies , that are related to spin - phonon or afm - fe couplings , are observed experimentally . a comparison to the mode frequencies predicted by lattice dynamical calculations ( lda ) allowed assignment of the raman and infrared lines to definite phonon modes or two - phonon raman scattering processes",
    "no evidence for two - magnon scattering was found in the low temperature antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "pure polycrystalline hexagonal homno@xmath0 was synthesized by a solid - state reaction of stoichiometric amounts of ho@xmath9o@xmath0 ( 99.99% ) and mno@xmath9 ( 99.99% ) , and further annealed for 24h at 1120@xmath10c in oxygen atmosphere .",
    "single crystals were grown by high temperature solution growth method using pbf@xmath9/pbo / b@xmath9o@xmath0 flux ( pbf@xmath9 : pbo : b@xmath9o@xmath0 = 0.8 : 0.195 : 0.005 ) .",
    "the flux was mixed with homno@xmath0 powder in a 7 : 1 ratio ) and annealed in a platinum crucible at 1250@xmath10c for 48h in oxygen .",
    "after that the temperature was decreased down to 1000@xmath10c at a rate of 0.5  c / h .",
    "the flux was decanted and well - shaped hexagonal plate - like crystals of typical size @xmath11  mm removed from the bottom of the crucible .    the raman spectra were measured under a microscope using a hr640 spectrometer equipped with a liquid - nitrogen - cooled ccd detector .",
    "the 514.5  nm and 632.8  nm lines of ar@xmath12 and he - ne laser were used for excitation .",
    "the infrared reflectance was measured with a bomem da8 fourier - transform interferometer equipped with a near - normal incidence reflectance stage and a liquid - helium - cooled bolometer .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of dielectric function , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , were obtained through kramers - kronig analysis .    the lattice dynamical calculations for",
    "homno@xmath0 were performed within the shell model used earlier for ymno@xmath0@xcite .",

    "the group - theoretical analysis shows that long - wavelengths zone - center ( @xmath17-point ) phonons are distributed among irreducible representations of the c@xmath18 point group as follows@xcite :    @xmath19 = 10a@xmath20 + 5a@xmath9 + 10b@xmath20 + 5b@xmath9 + 15e@xmath20 + 15e@xmath9 ) . of them",
    "acoustic , raman - active and infrared - active phonons are , respectively    @xmath21 = a@xmath20 + e@xmath20 ;    @xmath22 = 9a@xmath20 + 14e@xmath20 + 15e@xmath9 ;    @xmath23 = 9a@xmath20 + 14e@xmath20 .",
    "optical modes of a@xmath9 , b@xmath20 , and b@xmath9 symmetries are silent .",
    "a@xmath20 vibrations correspond to ion displacements along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "depending on the scattering configuration one can activate either longitudinal optical ( lo ) a@xmath20 modes , when phonon propagation direction coincides with the direction of ion displacements ( @xmath24 polarization ) or transverse ( to ) modes ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 configurations ) .",
    "non - polar e@xmath9 vibrations are allowed in @xmath27 polarization , while e@xmath20 are raman active in @xmath28 polarization . in the latter case",
    "experimentally observed e@xmath20 modes have the transverse character .        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the distribution of all 90 normal vibrations of hexagonal homno@xmath0 according to the symmetry type at various points of the brillouin zone ( see ,",
    "e.g. @xcite ) is summarized in table  iii . in this table",
    "special points are grouped according to their symmetry . in table",
    "iv the selection rules for overtones and combination tones are presented for the hexagonal brillouin zone , where the notations of refs .",
    "@xcite are used .",
    "it follows from the table that for all special points of the brillouin zone overtones always contributes to the fully symmetric a@xmath20 component , while combinations of phonons belonging to different symmetries never contain a@xmath20 representation .",
    "the second - order scattering spectra of homno@xmath0 single crystals in various scattering configurations and temperatures 300 and 10k are displayed in fig .",
    "6 . as it is seen , no second - order lines are detected in the spectra obtained for @xmath29 and @xmath30 polarizations ( two lowest curves in fig .",
    "the cut - off frequency of the two - phonon spectrum is expected be at the double frequency of the highest energy @xmath17-point phonon ( 2 @xmath31 685 @xmath32 = 1370 @xmath32 ) .",
    "the peak at 1368 @xmath32 , which is observed in the @xmath33 polarization , corresponds to the overtone of the highest frequency a@xmath20-symmetry phonon at the brillouin zone center .",
    "the peak at lower frequency , 1280 @xmath32 , which is observed in both @xmath33 and @xmath34 scattering geometries , is probably due to the overtone of the same vibration in other special points ( k , m , or l ) .",
    "under this assumption the estimated dispersion of the high - frequency branch through the brillouin zone is approximately 45 @xmath32 .",
    "several peaks in the frequency range 1080 - 1117 , which are especially pronounced in the @xmath33 polarization at 10k , are probably due to combinations of the high - frequency mode with the phonon branches in the range 350 - 463 @xmath32 at various points of the brillouin zone . a broad peak centered at 874 @xmath32",
    "may be related to the overtones of these latter modes .",
    "we note that the second - order raman scattering spectra for hexagonal homno@xmath0 are very similar to those reported earlier for ymno@xmath0 in terms of relative line intensities and position of the most intense features@xcite .",
    "by means of polarized raman scattering and infrared reflection spectroscopy phonon excitations in hexagonal homno@xmath0 single crystals are studied .",
    "the zone - center vibrations are assigned to definite crystal modes based on their polarization properties and the results of the shell model lattice dynamics calculations .",
    "the results of the group - theoretical analysis of the two - phonon processes and raman scattering selection rules are used to interpret experimental second - order raman scattering spectra . at the magnetic transition temperature t@xmath1=76k pronounced anomalies of the raman- and infrared - active phonon modes , which modulate mn - mn interaction ,",
    "are found experimentally and interpreted as the evidence for spin - phonon coupling .",
