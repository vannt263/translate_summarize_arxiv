    "the model is applied within a wide spectral range from 2650   to 5500  .",
    "we explore the uv lines ( @xmath0 2650 - 3050  ) , which are in the 2800   spectral range , and the optical lines ( @xmath0 4000 - 5500  ) which are in the balmer lines ( h@xmath2 , h@xmath17 , h@xmath18 ) spectral range .      to fit the optical emission lines , the optical continuum is estimated using the continuum windows given in @xcite .",
    "the points of the continuum level are interpolated and the continuum is subtracted .",
    "after that , emission lines in the @xmath0 4000 - 5500   range are fitted with a model of multi - gaussian functions @xcite , where each gaussian is assumed to represent emission from one emission region .",
    "the width and shift of each gaussian reflects the kinematical properties of an emission region ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "[ 1 ] .      in order to fit the lines in the uv range ( @xmath0 2650 - 3050  )",
    ", first one needs to model the uv balmer pseudocontinuum .",
    "the uv balmer pseudocontinuum consists of the power law and the bump at 3000  , which represents the sum of the blended , broad , high - order balmer lines and the balmer continuum .",
    "we fit simultaneously the power law and the balmer continuum ( together with high order balmer lines ) , using the model described in @xcite .",
    "this model consists of the function given in @xcite for the balmer continuum , in the case of a partially optically thick cloud , but with one degree of freedom less : for the intensity of the balmer continuum , which is calculated using the prominent balmer lines in the spectra . in this way",
    ", the less uncertain estimation of the balmer continuum is achieved .",
    "the balmer continuum intensity at the balmer edge ( @xmath3 = 3646  ) is equal to the sum of the intensities of all high order balmer lines at the same wavelength ( @xmath3 = 3646  ) .",
    "the broad component of each balmer line is roughly described with only one gaussian , which has the same width and shift for all balmer lines , and their relative intensities are taken from the literature or calculated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "then , if the width , shift , and intensity of only one broad balmer line ( e.g. h@xmath2 ) are obtained from the fit and the sum of the fluxes of all high - order balmer lines that contribute to the balmer edge have been calculated , then we can obtain the intensity of the balmer continuum at the balmer edge .",
    "the model is applied for the uniform temperature t@xmath21=15 000 k and optical depth at the balmer edge fixed at : @xmath22=1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "using this model , the pseudocontinuum is fitted with four free parameters : the width , shift and intensity of the one of prominent balmer line ( in our case h@xmath2 or h@xmath17 ) , and the exponent of the power law .    to apply the balmer continuum model , it is important to have a clean profile of strong broad balmer lines without any contamination from lines that overlap with them ( optical and [ o iii ] ) , as well as without the narrow component of balmer lines",
    ". we used the fitted data in the optical range to subtract the narrow components and satellite lines , and to obtain the broad balmer line profile .",
    "then , we applied the same procedure for fitting the uv - pseudocontinuum as described in @xcite .",
    "an example of the uv - pseudocontinuum fit is shown in fig [ 2 ] .    because it is very important to correctly subtract the balmer continuum in order to measure well the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the uv lines , the applicability of the model is tested using the total sample of 293 agns chosen for this investigation .",
    "we measured the difference between the observed flux and calculated flux ( balmer continuum + power law ) , and results are presented in @xcite , section 3 .",
    "we found that the discrepancy between the observed and calculated flux in the uv ( at @xmath62650  ) is smaller than 10% for 92% of the sample .",
    "this means that for the majority of the objects from the sample , the ews are probably measured well .",
    "the other 8% of objects , with uncertain continuum determination , do not affect the final result .",
    "after determination and subtraction of the uv - pseudocontinuum , the 2800   line and template are simultaneously fit .",
    "note that the 2800   line is the resonant doublet @xmath0 2795 , 2803  , where two lines of the doublet can not be resolved because of their very large widths .",
    "the doublet is observed in the spectra of the type 1 agns as a broad , single line .",
    "it is very difficult to find an appropriate model to fit the components of the doublet because their relative intensities are not fixed , i.e. their flux ratio depends on optical depth in the line .",
    "in general , one can expect a doublet ratio from optically thick gas to be approximately in the range @xmath32795/@xmath32803@xmath232:1 to 1:1 @xcite .",
    "additionally , it is not possible to get an unique gaussian decomposition because two broad doublet components overlap with central wavelength difference ( @xmath24 8  ) . in order to make the fitting procedure more simple",
    ", we fit the doublet as a single 2800   line with two gaussians : one that fits the core and one that fits the wings of the 2800    line . in this way , doppler widths of the gaussians that fit the core and wings of the single 2800    line overestimate the doppler widths of the doublet components for @xmath23 260 km s@xmath25 ( @xmath68   separation ) .",
    "because the widths of the lines are generally one order of magnitude larger than this value , we assume that it is in the range of the error - bars .",
    "the numerous uv lines are fitted with the model described in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the strongest uv lines , within @xmath0 2650 - 3050    range , are divided into 4 multiplets : 60 ( @xmath0 2907 - 2979  ) , 61 ( @xmath0 2861 - 2917  ) , and additionally with 62 and 63 which overlap at @xmath0 2709 - 2749  . the lines are fitted with 4 parameters of the intensity , for each multiplet . within one multiplet group ,",
    "the relative intensities of the lines are fixed using the line strength from nist ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it has been assumed that all uv lines in this range are originating in the same emission region and consequently to have the same doppler width and shift .",
    "therefore , the uv template consists of 6 free parameters in the fitting procedure ( 4 parameters of intensity , width and shift ) .    the list of the lines and multiplets of the uv template , as well as the transitions and relative intensities within each multiplet , are given in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the most intensive line within each multiplet is scaled to the unit intensity .    in fig",

    "the illustrations of determination of the fwhm for h@xmath2 and are shown in fig [ 4a ] .",
    "kinematical properties of the lines ( widths and shifts ) reflect the motion of the emitting gas .",
    "the width of the line ( or the line component ) depends on random or gravitational bounded motion of the emitting gas , while the shift is caused by the systemic motion of the gas in an emission region .",
    "therefore , similarities between kinematical properties of the different emission lines may indicate a kinematical connection between their emission regions .    in order to investigate the kinematical connections between the uv and optical emission regions ,",
    "we perform the correlations between the kinematical properties of the analyzed uv and optical emission lines .",
    "the widths and shifts of the lines and their components ( represented by different gaussians ) are obtained from the best fit .",
    "as mentioned in sec 2.1 , in our fitting model we assume that all narrow lines ( nlr component of balmer lines and [ ] lines ) are arising in the same emission region , and therefore have the same doppler widths and shifts .",
    "similarly , it is assumed that the core components of all balmer lines arise in ilr , and the wing components in vblr , and consequently they have the identical kinematical properties .",
    "therefore , we now investigate possible correlations between kinematical parameters of the lines which are the free parameters , i.e. between balmer components which arise in the nlr , ilr , vblr , core , wings and the lines in the uv and optical range .",

    "it is interesting that the correlation between the widths of the uv and optical lines is weaker than correlation of their widths with some other lines from the spectral range .",
    "the strongest correlation of the uv width is with the core of the ( r=0.49 , p=0 ; fig [ 5 ] , left ) , whereas its correlations with the widths of the optical lines and balmer line ilr component are slightly less significant ( r=0.39 , p@xmath232e-12 ) .",

    "in our previous work , we discussed the location of the optical emission region ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and found that it is located in an outer part of the blr ( so - called the ilr ) , which is recently confirmed by reverberation ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the correlation between the widths of the optical and uv lines indicates that the uv emission region is probably located close to the optical one .",
    "moreover , the widths and the shifts of the uv and optical lines are correlated with the widths and shifts of the core and h@xmath2 ilr component ( see table [ tbl-2 ] and table [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "the average widths of the uv and optical lines are very similar ( 2530 km s@xmath25 and 2360 km s@xmath25 ) , and they are both broader than the average widths of the h@xmath2 and cores ( 1930 km s@xmath25 and 1590 km s@xmath25 ) .",
    "the correlation of the iron lines width is even more significant with the fwhm of the total broad profile ( wings + core ) of and h@xmath2 , but there is no a positive correlation with the separated wing component of these lines .",
    "it seems that the iron lines ( both , uv and optical ) generally originate in the outer part of the blr ( ilr ) .",
    "however , as we mentioned in @xcite , there may be an additional emission of the lines ( in the uv and optical ) that is coming from the inner part of blr ( vblr ) .",
    "this emission is probably contributing to the continuum because the lines are very broad and can not be resolved in the bulk of lines in the uv and optical spectral ranges .    in order to test the location of the forming region of the uv and optical lines , we searched for the same geometry as in the and h@xmath2 emission regions .",
    "we modified the uv and optical iron templates , assuming that the profiles of the iron lines are the same as the profiles of the or h@xmath2 . we compared the accuracy of the new fits with the previous , single gaussian model ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we found that : ( a ) single gaussian profile gives better fit for the uv iron lines , compared with and h@xmath2 profiles , ( b ) h@xmath2 profile fits slightly better optical than single gaussian profile .",

    "is 350@xmath26510 km s@xmath25 , whereas for the uv is much larger : 1150@xmath26580 km s@xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the systemic redshift ( relative to the [ o iii ] ) could be significantly detected only in the uv fe ii , but it is not significant in the optical fe ii .",

    "this model reproduces well the observed @xmath5 flux ratio .    the results from this paper , the significant average systemic redshift for the uv , and absence of the significant redshift for the optical , support the model given by @xcite .",
    "although the uv and optical emission is emitted from approximately the same region in the agn structure , it might be that the distribution of emitting clouds is different : the uv emission clouds are probably distributed asymmetrically , while the optical ones have the isotropic distribution .",

    "the uv and optical lines arise in the close emission regions in the agn structure .",
    "most of the uv / optical emission is probably originating in the intermediate line emission region i.e. a region with doppler velocities around 1500 - 2000 @xmath47 .",
    "however , the lines tend to be broader than the ilr components of h@xmath2 and , which indicates a small contribution of vblr emission , at least in the optical lines",
    "the significant systemic redshift , which is the signature of the gas infall , is found only for the uv lines ( 1150@xmath26580 km s@xmath25 ) , but not for the optical ( 350@xmath26510 km s@xmath25 ) .",
    "this indicates that , although the uv and optical emission clouds are located in approximately the same region of the agn structure , their distribution is probably different : the uv emission clouds seem to be distributed asymmetrically ( we see more shielded , infalling clouds ) while the optical emission clouds are probably isotropically distributed . except emission region asymmetry",
    ", some other models can explain high uv redshift , e.g. more efficient excitation of the uv lines in the infalling gas , due to shock waves .",
    "there are significant differences between the optical and uv lines , which are presented in different correlations between these lines and other spectral properties .",
    "the intriguing anticorrelations found for the optical ( ew fe ii@xmath1 vs. ew [ ] and ew fe ii@xmath1 vs. fwhm h@xmath2 ) , which are part of the @xcite eigenvector 1 , are not detected for the uv fe ii .",
    "beside all analyzed broad lines , only the ew fe ii@xmath1 anticorrelates with ew some other emission line ( [ ] ) , and only ew fe ii@xmath1 increases as the widths of all broad lines ( including fe ii@xmath1 ) decrease .",
    "the peculiar anticorrelations of the optical are probably connected with a high density and a large column density region in agns with a high star formation rate .",
    "the anticorrelation between ews of the optical and [ ] lines is probably due increase of the additional excitation mechanism of the optical with the increase of the column density , and at the same time , a decrease of the forbidden [ ] lines due collisional suppression , or because of low ionization continuum from starbursts . on the other hand , the anticorrelation ew fe ii@xmath1 vs. fwhm h@xmath2 is present because the agns , with high star formation rate and large column density regions , are expected to be young objects with a smaller mass of the black hole and widths of the broad lines that are generally narrower than in the spectra of older , pure agns .",
    "these correlations are not detected in the uv lines , since their optical thickness is larger than for optical , so with increasing column density , uv lines decrease more rapidly than optical .",
    "other explanations of the these correlations are possible .",

    "both , the and broad balmer lines can be decomposed into two components , the vblr and ilr , which shows a complex structure of the blr .",
    "moreover , there is an anticorrelation between the width and shift of the wing component , that indicates the asymmetry in the mg ii , i.e. the narrower wing component tends to be asymmetric .",
    "it seems that the explored line ratios ( see table [ tbl-8 ] ) are connected with the fwhms of broad lines , especially with fwhm mg ii , where a positive trend between fwhm and ratios @xmath35 and @xmath34 is found , and anticorrelations with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "in order to fit the optical iron lines with the h@xmath2 line profile , we modify the iron template , so that instead of one gaussian for each iron line , there are two gaussians with the same widths , relative shifts , and relative intensities as the ilr and vblr h@xmath2 components . we keep the same relative intensities between the iron lines in the multiplets as in the initial , single gaussian template , and the shift of the template is the free parameter .",

    "we repeat this procedure for the uv lines using and h@xmath2 profiles in the uv template in the same way , but this time line is fitted simultaneously with uv fe ii template , which is made of profiles . for template with h@xmath2 profiles we use the fixed values of h@xmath2 parameters , which were obtained from the fit in the optical range .",
    "an example of the one object fit ( sdss j020435.18@xmath48093154.9 ) with the different iron templates is given in figs [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] .",
    "it can be seen that fit of the optical lines with h@xmath2 profiles ( b ) is slightly better than with single gaussian model ( a ) , whereas the iron template with profiles can not fit well the optical iron lines ( c ) . in the case of the uv lines ,",
    "the single gaussian model ( a ) fits the iron lines better , than other two templates ( b and c ) .",
    "we compare the @xmath49 of the fits obtained from the different templates with the @xmath49 of the initial fit where the iron lines are fitted with one gaussian for each line .",
    "the results for the whole sample are given in table [ app ] .",
    "generally , the differences between @xmath49 obtained with different templates are , for most of objects , small and less than 5% .",
    "the fit of the optical iron lines with the h@xmath2 profiles gives a slightly better fit , comparing the single gaussian model for @xmath685 % of objects from the sample . only in 3% of objects ,",
    "fit is significantly improved ( the difference between @xmath49 higher than 10% ) . in the case of the fit of optical iron lines with the profile ,",
    "only in the half of the sample fits are better .",
    "the fit of the uv iron lines is less accurate with h@xmath2 and profiles than with one gaussian model for the majority of objects from the sample .",

    "<S> ( i ) there is a kinematical connection between the uv and optical lines , indicating that the uv and optical lines originate from the outer part of the broad line region , so - called intermediate line region ; ( ii ) the unexplained anticorrelations of the optical ( ew fe ii@xmath1 ) vsersus ew [ ] 5007   and ew fe ii@xmath1 versus fwhm h@xmath2 have not been detected for the uv lines ; ( iii ) the significant averaged redshift in the uv lines , which is not present in optical , indicates an inflow in the uv emitting clouds , and probably their asymmetric distribution . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) also , we confirm the anticorrelation between the intensity ratio of the optical and uv lines and fwhm of h@xmath2 , and we find the anticorrelations of this ratio with the widths of 2800  , optical and uv . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a very important role for the column density and microturbulence in the emitting gas . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the starburst activity in high  density regions of young agns as a possible explanation of the detected optical correlations and intensity line ratios of the uv and optical lines . </S>"
