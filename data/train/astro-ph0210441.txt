    "dark matter halos , which are the virialized systems formed via the gravitational amplification of initial density fluctuations , are one of the most important cosmological probes . since their evolution is governed purely by gravity , their number density and the evolution of clustering properties can be precisely predicted analytically as well as numerically .",
    "weak lensing is a unique observational technique to detect dark matter halos because it detects halos not by their _ light _ but by more essential physical parameter , the _",
    "mass_. it also allows us to directly estimate the halo mass bypassing a use of ambiguous empirical relations like the mass - temperature ( or velocity dispersion ) or mass - luminosity relations .",
    "therefore , comparison of theories and weak lensing observations is a direct and reliable way to test the paradigm of the structure formation and to constrain the cosmological parameters .",
    "theoretical prescriptions for predicting statistics of weak lensing halos have been developed so far .",
    "@xcite first calculated the expected number of dark matter halos detected by means of the aperture mass method @xcite .",
    "predicted number density of halos exceeds 10 per deg@xmath4 for cluster - normalized cosmologies if one obtains moderately deep images whose galaxy density is @xmath830 arcmin@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the number density is sensitive to the density profile of halos . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite discussed the statistics of the _ peaks _ on convergence map .",
    "they claimed that the statistics can be an alternative approach to probe the mass function of dark matter halos and to constrain @xmath10 .",
    "observationally , weak lensing has become reliable measures to map the dark matter distribution in clusters of galaxies ( see a review by mellier 1999 ) .",
    "recently , serendipitous detections of mass concentrations outside clusters on a reconstructed mass map have been reported by several authors @xcite .",
    "all cases have no clear optical counterparts except the one by @xcite which is identified as a cluster of galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "these findings demonstrate that dark matter halo search via weak lensing is feasible and can detect even lower luminosity dark matter halos that are overlooked in conventional optical cluster surveys .",
    "the number of samples obtained so far is , however , limited . in order to make statistically significant discussions ,",
    "weak lensing survey over a representative cosmic volume is crucial .",
    "the survey requires not only wide field but also high image quality to make reliable lensing analysis .",
    "suprime - cam on the 8 m subaru telescope is the most ideal camera for the purpose .",
    "the median seeing in @xmath12 band monitored over a year and a half is reported to be @xmath13 0.6 arcsec @xcite . in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the first results from the suprime - cam weak lensing survey that covers contiguous 2.1 deg@xmath0 field .",
    "we examine statistical properties of local peaks on the reconstructed convergence map by comparing with model predictions .",
    "we set field size at 2.1 deg@xmath4 , which is the largest size possible to be accomplished during the commissioning phase of the suprime - cam .",

    "the 2.1 deg@xmath4 field has twelve gho clusters and one abell cluster ( a 2158 ) .",
    "note , however , that the number density of clusters in this field is comparable to the one averaged over the seven gho fields .",
    "we obtained @xmath1-band images on the nights of 2001 april 23 - 25 .",
    "suprime - cam provides a field of view of 34@xmath18 27 with a scale 0\".202 pixel@xmath19 .",
    "nine contiguous fields were observed in 3@xmath183 mosaic configuration .",
    "each exposure on a given field was offset by 1 from other exposures to remove cosmic rays and defects on the ccds .",
    "total exposure time on each field was 1800 sec ( 360 sec @xmath18 5 ) .",
    "the individual images were de - biased and then flattened using a median of all object frames taken during the observing run .",
    "registration on each field was first performed assuming a simple geometrical model .",
    "the parameters of the model include ( 1 ) optical distortion , ( 2 ) displacement and rotation of each ccd from the fiducial position and ( 3 ) the offset of pointing between the exposures @xcite .",
    "these parameters can be solved by minimizing position errors of control stars common to all exposures and used for the first transformation of the images to a common coordinate system .",
    "after the transformation , the residual of the position of the control stars is @xmath13 0.5 pixel rms .",
    "the residual is due to several effects not considered in the simple model including atmospheric dispersion and asymmetric aberration of optics .",
    "we note , however , that the residual vector is smoothly changing over position and can be well modeled as the third order bi - linear polynomial function of position .",
    "this model then gives the fine correction of the transformation function . as a result",
    "the final residual decreased typically down to 0.07 pixel rms ( 14 miliarcsec ) .",
    "the seeing in the resulting image is 0``.68 fwhm and the scatter among the fields is quite small of 0''.04 rms .",
    "we used the software suite _ imcat _",

    "catalogs created for the nine fields are registered using stars on overlapping regions to result in a final catalog whose total field of view is 1.64@xmath17 @xmath18 1.28@xmath17 .",
    "differences in photometric zero point among the fields due to variation of sky condition were compensated at this stage but the adjustment was not significant ( @xmath13 0.05 mag ) . for weak lensing analysis , we adopt galaxies of @xmath20 whose signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio , @xmath21 , calculated in the imcat exceed 15 @xcite . the number of objects in the catalog is 297547 ( 39.3 arcmin@xmath9 ) and the count peaks at r = 25.2 .",
    "the estimate of the shear , @xmath22 , from the observed ellipticities of galaxies , @xmath23 involves two steps where @xmath24 are quadrupole moments of the surface brightness of objects .",
    "first , psf anisotropy is corrected using the image of stars as references , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the smear polarisability tensors and is mostly diagonal @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 was calculated for stars scattered over the field of view and we made fifth order bi - polynomial fit to the values as a function of the positions .",

    "the _ pre-_seeing shear @xmath22 is described as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the shear polarisability tensor .",
    "the @xmath31 of individual galaxies are , however , known to be noisy estimate and we thus adopted smoothing and weighting method developed by van waerbeke et al.(2000 ; see also erben et al .",

    "the variance of raw @xmath34 before the smoothing among the neighbors , @xmath35 , is used to estimate the weight of the object , @xmath36 , as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the variance of all the objects in the catalog and @xmath39 here . under the weighting scheme",
    ", an averaged value of a certain observable , @xmath40 , is calculated as @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 for all objects is calculated as @xmath44 but @xmath31 depends on @xmath32 .",
    "for objects with @xmath45 , @xmath43 is almost constant , @xmath46 , and becomes small below the @xmath32 down to @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "the convergence field , @xmath49 , is estimated using the original @xcite inversion algorithm with a gaussian window function @xmath50 . in order to estimate the noise of @xmath49 field",
    ", we randomized the orientations of the galaxies in the catalog and created a @xmath51 map .",
    "the variance of the @xmath51 depends on the smoothing scale @xmath52 and is represented as @xmath53 .",
    "this turned out to be consistent with theoretical estimate , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56arcmin@xmath9 are the observed variance of galaxy ellipticities and number density , respectively , yielding @xmath57 .",
    "we repeated the randomization 100 times and compute the rms among them at each grid where @xmath49 is computed .",
    "since @xmath49 is gaussian in its errors , this rms represents 1-@xmath3 noise level on each grid , and thus the measured signal divided by the rms gives the s / n ratio , @xmath58 , at that grid . thick contour in fig .",

    ", the galaxy density also shows an excess as large as the other known clusters .",
    "in fact , a spectroscopic observation of two member galaxies implies that it is a cluster located at the redshift of 0.41 .",
    "this object is not listed on the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "other follow - up observations are underway and detailed comparison of mass and light will be discussed in subsequent papers .",
    "let us turn to statistical properties of the s / n - map , and we will compare the results with the model predictions .",
    "first , we examine the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of peaks .",
    "peaks are identified by pixels having a higher or lower value of @xmath58 than the all eight surrounding pixels as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the pdf of the peak heights is shown as thick histograms of left two panels in fig .",
    "[ fmax_jvw_kappa ] .",
    "the thin histogram shows a noise pdf measured from @xmath51 maps , the average of 100 randomizations is plotted and the error bars show the rms among them .",
    "the bimodal feature of the noise pdf is due to superposition of two contributions each of which is due to positive peaks and negative peaks (= troughs ) .",
    "excess counts over the noise pdf is apparent on both positive ( @xmath60 ) and negative ( @xmath61 ) side of the histogram .",
    "the excess becomes more apparent as @xmath52 increases .",
    "the positive peaks imply the existence of dark matter halos whereas the natural explanation of the negative peaks seen is voids @xcite .",
    "this is the first observational evidence of the existence of voids in the matter distribution revealed by weak lensing .",
    "right panels of fig .",
    "[ fmax_jvw_kappa ] show the peak pdf measured from numerical experiments of the gravitational lensing by large - scale structures .",
    "the experiments were performed using the ray - tracing technique combined with large n - body simulations and its details are described in mnard et al .",
    "briefly , @xmath62-body data from very large simulation carried out by the virgo consortium ( jenkins et al 2001 ; yoshida , sheth & diaferio 2001 ) were used to generate the dark matter distribution . a @xmath63cdm model ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) is assumed .",
    "the multiple - lens plane ray - tracing algorithm was used to follow the light rays ( hamana & mellier 2001 , see also jain , seljak & white 2000 for technical detail ) . the lensing convergence and shear",
    "were computed for 1024@xmath4 pixels with the pixel size of 0.25 arcmin for a single source plane of @xmath68 .",
    "we generated the simulated noisy @xmath49 map following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the noise is modeled as a gaussian random field with the variance measured in the real data .",
    "the peak is identified as the same manner as for the observed data .",
    "ten realizations of the numerical experiment were used to compute the peak pdf ( the total field size is @xmath69 deg@xmath4 , much larger than the observed data , and thus the peak distribution is very smooth ) .",
    "the simulated pdf is very similar to the observed pdf .",
    "jain & van waerbeke ( 2000 ) pointed out that the peak pdf can be used to discriminate the cosmological model .",
    "they demonstrated using the ray - tracing experiments of a high density ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) and a low density(@xmath64 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) models that the high density model has broader distribution than the low density model , especially on the negative side .",
    "it should be noticed that they adopted @xmath73 which is about half of our measured value , therefore one should not directly compare our real pdfs with theirs ( figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the limited statistics of this work , theoretical prescription of the peak pdf is , however , still premature for placing constraint on the cosmological model in a quantitative manner .",
    "we therefore concentrate only on excess on the positive side here ; the halo number count .",
    "we calculated number of the positive peaks , @xmath74 , in the observed s / n map exceeding @xmath75 .",
    "halo number count is defined as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is average peak counts obtained on the randomized catalogs and their variances , respectively .",
    "the halo count is shown in fig .",
    "[ n_nu ] as well as theoretical predictions which are constructed following kruse & schneider ( 1999 ) .",
    "we assumed a high positive peak in @xmath49 map comes from a single halo whose number density is described by press - schechter mass function ( press & schechter 1974 ; we used its modified model by sheth & tormen 1999 ) .",
    "we further assumed that all halos have a universal density profile that navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) proposed ( nfw ) ; @xmath79 .",
    "we also compared the results with another halo profile , singular isothermal sphere model ( sis ) ; @xmath80 .",
    "for the relation between the scale length of the halo and halo mass we adopted the fitting form by bullock et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath81 measured from observed data is used to convert @xmath49 to @xmath58 .",
    "note that kruse & schneider ( 1999 ) and bartelmann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) adopted @xmath73 , thus their predicted count is much larger than our prediction .",
    "first , if one considers only highly significant halos , say @xmath82 , the predicted halo number count does not depends strongly on the background cosmology as is presented in fig.3 , where dashed line and solid line shows the scdm model ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) and @xmath63cdm ( @xmath64 , @xmath87 , @xmath67 , @xmath66 ) , respectively .",
    "the count , however , depends on the halo profile ; the sis predicts less counts as is shown in the dotted line in the figure .",
    "the observed count prefers nfw profile although the poisson error in @xmath88 is large in this work .",
    "it is demonstrated here that number count of highly significant halos can be an useful probe for the dark matter halo profile because of the independence of background cosmology .",
    "meanwhile , the dependence becomes clearly visible in the counts of moderately significant haloes ( @xmath89 ) ; the scdm predicts more counts than lcdm does due mainly to larger @xmath10 .",
    "our observed result shows high number counts which favors high density universe .",
    "this result , however , can not be taken at face value since the large excess is apparent in fig.[fmax_jvw_kappa ] as a spike around @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the excess count in the moderately significant halos is likely due to the cosmic variance .",
    "comparison of data taken on multiple ( say 5 to 10 ) uncorrelated fields of this size is necessary to evaluate the contribution from the cosmic variance and eventually to discuss cosmological models .    in summary",
    ", the present work clearly demonstrates that weak lensing technique is indeed a promising way to probe matter distribution purely through the mass .",
    "we detected not only the high positive peaks due to massive halos but also the excess in the peak pdf on the negative side which is the first observational evidence of the voids in dark matter distribution .",
    "dark matter halo counts is proved to be the useful tool to test the paradigm of the structure formation and cosmological models .",
    "the cosmic variance that we encountered in this work should be evaluated by the data obtained by future high resolution wider field imaging survey .",
