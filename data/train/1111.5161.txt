    "see @xcite and references therein for more detail regarding ( [ 1 ] ) and its non - local versions .",
    "in fact , the last decade of studies has lead to almost complete description of the existence , uniqueness and stability properties of wavefronts to ( [ 1 ] ) whenever @xmath3 satisfies ( * h * ) and the following quite important sub - tangency condition @xmath23 the latter inequality was already used in the celebrated work @xcite by a. kolmogorov , i. petrovskii and n. piskunov , where it was assumed that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 $ ] . roughly speaking , inequality ( [ st ] )",
    "amounts to the dominance of the ` linear component ' within essentially non - linear model ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it is needless to say that , from the technical point of view , ( [ st ] ) allows to simplify enormously the analysis of traveling waves . in subsections 1.1 - 1.3 below",
    "we will illustrate this point in greater detail by discussing such key issues as the minimal ( critical ) speed of propagation , the stability , existence and uniqueness of waves , the asymptotic properties of wave profiles .",
    "therefore it is not a big surprise that none of these issues has been adequately addressed in that strongly nonlinear case when ( [ st ] ) does not hold and @xmath7 , the wavefront problem for ( [ 1 ] ) is essentially bi - dimensional in many aspects and it is rather well understood , cf .",
    "next , since @xmath26 is negative for some @xmath27 , schaaf s results @xcite can not be applied to ( [ 1 ] ) . in any event ,",
    "the question of pushed waves was not considered in @xcite . ] .",
    "so our main objective in this paper is to complete the study of the existence , uniqueness and asymptotics of wavefronts to delayed reaction - diffusion equation ( [ 1 ] ) considered under hypothesis * ( h ) * and without condition ( [ st ] ) .    at this stage of discussion , it is instructive to raise the same questions but for a different family of delayed evolution equations @xmath28 - u(t , x ) + g(u(t - h , x ) ) , \\ x \\in { { \\bbb r}}.\\ ] ] it is obtained from ( [ 1 ] ) , @xmath29 , by a formal discretization of the laplace operator .",

    "n \\in { { \\bbb z}}.\\ ] ] equations ( [ 1d ] ) , ( [ 1dl ] ) are special cases of more general nonlocal lattice population model proposed in @xcite .",
    "these equations were analyzed by ma and zou in @xcite .",
    "once again , in order to prove the existence , uniqueness , monotonicity and stability of wavefronts , ( [ st ] ) together with * ( h ) * were assumed in the cited work .",
    "one of the notorious features of @xcite consists in its novel ( and non - trivial ) proof of the wave uniqueness .",
    "this proof does not impose any restriction on @xmath31\\}$ ] what is remarkable in the case of delayed equations , cf .",
    "subsection 1.2 .",
    "on the other hand , starting from the pioneering work of zinner , harris and hudson @xcite , significant progress has been achieved in the understanding of waves solutions in non - delayed versions of ( [ 1d ] ) , ( [ 1dl ] ) .",
    "see @xcite for more information and further references .",
    "non - delayed equation ( [ 1d ] ) can be also viewed as a particular case of the following differential equation with convolution @xmath32 which was firstly introduced by kolmogorov _",
    "et al _ in @xcite .",
    "the latter equation was thoroughly investigated during the past three decades using various techniques , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "remarkably , sub - tangency condition ( [ st ] ) was avoided in the recent important contributions @xcite by chen _",
    "et al . _ and @xcite by coville _",
    "our present work was nourished in part by several ideas and approaches developed in the mentioned four papers .",
    "for example , our proof of the existence of the minimal speed @xmath33 is also based on the lower - upper solution method . once again , the main difficulty consists in finding a good upper solution ( which additionally has to dominate lower solution ) , cf .",
    "consonant ideas expressed in @xcite and @xcite . as in @xcite , we construct a new formal upper solution ( for some velocity @xmath34 close to a given velocity @xmath12 ) from a given wavefront @xmath35 . however , in difference with @xcite , our upper solution is not only formal but also _ true upper solution _ appearing in pair with an appropriate lower solution .",
    "we neither apply the truncation procedure as in @xcite nor we use our upper solution as a bound obligating solutions of associated truncated problems to converge to a true wave solution ( this nice idea was proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "we consider @xmath35 only as a skeleton ( we call it a base function ) for creating a true upper solution by its suitable modification .",
    "recently , the method of base functions was successfully applied in our previous work @xcite to a model of the belousov - zhabotinskii reaction .",
    "now , two noteworthy differences appear while comparing ( [ 1dcon ] ) and ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "first of them is technical : the presence of the second derivatives in ( [ 1 ] ) complicates the construction of the lower and upper solutions for ( [ 1 ] ) ( these solutions must be @xmath19-smooth or satisfy additional conjugacy relations at the discontinuity points of the derivative , cf .",
    "the other difficulty is more essential : the presence of positive delay @xmath36 can lead to the non - monotonicity of traveling fronts @xcite while such monotonicity seems to be crucial for the applicability of various approaches , e.g. of the sliding solution method @xcite . precisely in order to avoid front oscillations around @xmath20 , we will consider strictly increasing @xmath3 in * ( h)*. it should be mentioned that monotonicity of @xmath3 is not obligatory when @xmath6 : this is because function @xmath37 is monotone in @xmath38 for @xmath39 , cf .",
    "@xcite .    before going back to more detailed analysis of the main problems addressed in this paper , we would like to state some useful results concerning the wavefronts to equation ( [ 1 ] ) considered under assumption * ( h)*. set @xmath40 and define @xmath41 [ respectively , @xmath42 as this unique positive number @xmath12 for which the characteristic equation @xmath43 with @xmath44 [ respectively , with @xmath45 has a double positive root .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath46 .",
    "note that @xmath47 coincides with the minimal speed of propagation @xmath33 whenever ( [ st ] ) is satisfied .",

    "next , for @xmath52 equation ( [ 1 ] ) does not possess any positive bounded wave solution @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , each such wave solution to ( [ 1 ] ) ( if exists ) is in fact a monotone front with profile @xmath54 satisfying @xmath55 for all @xmath56 . finally , if @xmath57 , then the following asymptotic representation is valid ( for an appropriate @xmath58 and some @xmath59 ) : @xmath60 if @xmath61 then besides ( [ afe ] ) it may happen that @xmath62    the existence of fronts for @xmath50 follows from ( * ? ?",

    "* proposition 7.2 ) should be used ) to obtain asymptotic formulas ( [ afe ] ) , ( [ afec ] ) .      by proposition [ pr1 ] , after assuming ( [ st ] ) , the minimal speed of propagation @xmath33 can be computed from the characteristic equation ( [ che ] ) considered with @xmath44 . without ( [ st ] ) , the computation of @xmath33 represents a very difficult task even for non - delayed models @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the value of @xmath33 depends not only on @xmath68 but also on the whole nonlinearity @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath7 and ( [ st ] ) does not hold , the situation becomes even more complicated : it is an open question whether there exists a positive @xmath33 splitting @xmath69 on subsets of admissible and non - admissible ( semi- ) wave speeds . in the present paper ,",

    "more subtle aspects of uniqueness and stability of wavefronts in ( [ 1 ] ) were studied so far under the geometric conditions even more restrictive than ( [ st ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath73 was required in the main stability theorem of @xcite .",
