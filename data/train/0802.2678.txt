    "jahn - teller ( jt ) transitions @xcite in which electronic degeneracies are removed by crystal distortions have been observed quite frequently in recent studies of molecule - based magnets @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the jt transition will be quenched if the degenerate levels carry orbital angular momentum and the spin - orbit coupling is sufficiently strong .",
    "when the spin - orbit coupling and jt energies are comparable , however , a pseudo - jt transition with rather interesting behavior is possible . in this paper , we study the jt transition in a class of molecule - based magnets where the spin - orbit coupling can be modified by choosing different organic cations to lie between bimetallic layers . due to the competition between the spin - orbit and jt energies ,",
    "the jt distortion may vanish at low temperatures in a re - entrant , first - order transition .",
    "one of the most fascinating classes of molecule - based magnets , bimetallic oxalates a[m(ii)m(iii)(ox)@xmath0 ] were first synthesized @xcite in 1992 . in the open honeycomb structure of each bimetallic layer , sketched in fig.1(a ) , the transition - metal ions m(ii ) and m(iii ) are coupled by the oxalate bridges ox = c@xmath5o@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "depending on the metal atoms , a single bimetallic layer can be either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic ( m(ii ) and m(iii ) moments parallel or anti - parallel ) with magnetic moments pointing out of the plane .",
    "while the organic cation a separating the layers can not alter the sign of the exchange coupling , it does affect the overall properties of the system .",
    "some fe(ii)fe(iii ) bimetallic oxalates exhibit magnetic compensation ( mc ) due to cancellation of the moments on the fe(ii ) and fe(iii ) sublattices below the ferrimagnetic transition temperature @xmath7 @xcite . based on symmetry and energy considerations ,",
    "we recently explained why mc occurs for some organic cations but not for others @xcite .",
    "the c@xmath0-symmetric crystal field ( invariant under in - plane rotations of @xmath8 ) splits the @xmath1 fe(ii ) multiplet into two doublets and a singlet . by shifting the fe(ii ) ions with respect to the oxalate molecules ,",
    "the cation a determines the average orbital angular momentum @xmath2 carried by the low - energy doublet .",
    "compounds exhibit mc when the low - energy doublet lies below the singlet and @xmath3 exceeds the threshold @xmath9 . for compounds that do not exhibit mc ( `` normal '' compounds ) , either @xmath10 or the singlet state lies lowest in energy .    in the absence of spin - orbit coupling or when @xmath11 , a jt distortion that breaks c@xmath0 symmetry will always split the low - energy doublet .",
    "for large enough @xmath3 , the spin - orbit coupling will quench the jt distortion .",
    "however , in a range of @xmath3 that includes @xmath9 , we obtain a jt - distorted phase between temperatures @xmath12 and @xmath13 that bracket @xmath7 .",
    "both the re - entrant , low - temperature transition @xmath12 and the normal , high - temperature transition @xmath13 are first order .",
    "comparison with recent experiments @xcite allows us to estimate the normal jt transition temperature @xmath13 in mc compounds .",
    "this paper is divided into 5 sections .",
    "section ii develops the phenomenological model for the jt transition , with results described in section iii .",
    "first - principles calculations are described in section iv and a discussion is contained in section v.",
    "our model assumes a hierarchy of three energy scales . the dominant energy is the hund s coupling that determines the spins @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the fe(ii ) ( 3d@xmath16 ) and",
    "fe(iii ) ( 3d@xmath17 ) sites .",
    "next in importance is the c@xmath0-symmetric crystal field @xmath18 generated by the 6 oxygen atoms around each of the fe sites .",
    "these 6 oxygen atoms form two triangles of slightly different sizes rotated by about 48 degrees with respect to each other , one above and the other below the plane of fe atoms .",
    "the smallest energies are the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling @xmath19 between the fe(ii ) and fe(iii ) moments within each bimetallic layer , the spin - orbit coupling @xmath20 on the fe(ii ) sites ( @xmath21 mev @xcite ) , and any non - c@xmath0-symmetric contributions of the crystal potential .    as shown in fig.1(b ) , the c@xmath0-symmetric potential @xmath18 splits the @xmath1 multiplet of the fe(ii ) sites into two doublets @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and a singlet @xmath24 .",
    "the low - energy doublet @xmath22 carries an average orbital angular momentum @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ranges from 0 to 2 depending on the crystal - field parameters .",
    "of course , the singlet state @xmath25 does not carry any orbital angular momentum .",
    "fe(ii ) orbitals in a c@xmath0-symmetric crystal - field , with either the doublet @xmath26 or the singlet @xmath27 lowest in energy . ]    including the orbital contribution , the fe(ii ) magnetic moment can be written @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "of course , the fe(iii ) magnetic moment @xmath31 has no orbital contribution . the mean - field ( mf )",
    "approximation is used to treat the nearest - neighbor exchange @xmath32 between neighboring fe(ii ) and f(iii ) spins .",
    "the mf eigenvalues of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 so that the doublet @xmath33 is split by the spin - orbit coupling with @xmath38 . because the crystal - field potential is assumed much larger than the spin - orbit and exchange energies , @xmath39 or @xmath40 .    using eqs.([ep1 ] ) and ( [ ep2 ] ) for the eigenvalues @xmath41 , it is straightforward to evaluate @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and the average magnetization @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath45 , @xmath46 passes through 0 at the compensation temperature @xmath47 . just below @xmath7 , @xmath48 because the parallel spin - orbit coupling between @xmath49 and @xmath50 causes the fe(ii ) moment @xmath42 to increase in amplitude more rapidly than the fe(iii ) moment @xmath43 .",
    "but at zero temperature , the fe(iii ) moment saturates at the larger value @xmath51 so that @xmath52 .    after comparing the observed values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 k with the theoretical predictions , we estimated @xcite that @xmath55 mev and @xmath56 in mc compounds .",
    "normal compounds can fall into two categories . either the doublet remains lower in energy than the singlet ( @xmath57 ) but with @xmath58 or the singlet lies lowest in energy ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "our model also predicted that two compensation points were possible in the narrow window @xmath60 .",
    "the recent observation by tang _",
    "_ @xcite of two compensation points in the compound n(n - c@xmath6h@xmath61)@xmath6[fe(ii)fe(iii)ox@xmath0 ] ( data shown in fig.3 ) would seem to confirm this prediction .",
    "if a doubly - degenerate level is occupied by a single electron in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , then a local jt displacement the fe(ii ) ions corresponding to one of three equivalent directions is always favored by the electronic energy .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath62 and @xmath63 on the fe(ii ) sites are mixed by the jt distortion as described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is independent of @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath67 are given by the mf result @xmath68 , then the eigenstates of @xmath69 are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and eigenvalues @xmath73 .",
    "so in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , the orbital angular momentum is quenched by the jt distortion and the doublet @xmath74 is split by @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath76 energy is then given by @xmath77 , where the second term is an elastic restoring potential and @xmath78 is the number of fe(ii ) or fe(iii ) sites per bimetallic layer . since @xmath79 ,",
    "the @xmath76 equilibrium value for @xmath65 is @xmath80 .    including the spin - orbit interaction @xmath81 , the eigenvalues of @xmath69 are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the doublet splitting @xmath85 is enhanced by the jt effect ( strictly speaking , the pseudo - jt effect when @xmath86 ) . since there is no spin - orbit coupling",
    "when @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath90 , the spin - orbit coupling maintains a nonzero orbital angular momentum @xmath91 even in the presence of a jt distortion : @xmath92 so that @xmath93 .",
    "when @xmath94 , the jt distortion suppresses the absolute values @xmath95 for @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    with a correction to avoid double counting , the mf free energy can be written @xmath98 where @xmath99 @xmath100 the sums in the partition functions @xmath101 and @xmath102 are over @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the second line in eq.([fr ] ) corresponds to the elastic energy .",
    "breaking c@xmath0 symmetry , a local jt distortion with @xmath105 involves the displacement of an fe(ii ) atom either into one of the three open hexagons or towards one of the three neighboring fe(iii ) atoms .",
    "the former distortions are sketched in fig.1(a ) .",
    "the anharmonic @xmath106 term in eq.([fr ] ) reflects the different energy costs for those two types of distortions .",
    "so the anharmonicity and source of the first - order jt transition arise quite naturally on the open honeycomb lattice .",
    "the sign of @xmath107 does not affect any physical results and is chosen to be negative only so that @xmath108 .",
    "any fluctuations between the distorted atomic configurations are assumed slow compared to the electronic time scales .",
    "it is simple to obtain the equilibrium values for @xmath109 and @xmath110 from the extremal conditions @xmath111 . because the spin - orbit energy @xmath81 is treated exactly",
    ", @xmath112 is not a variational parameter in the mf free energy and must be determined separately from the condition @xmath113 of course , the equilibrium value for the jt parameter @xmath65 is obtained by minimizing @xmath114 with respect to @xmath65 .",
    "the average magnetization and jt energy @xmath65 are plotted versus temperature in figs.2(a ) and ( b ) for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "as expected , the mc threshold @xmath118 is enhanced by the jt distortion . when @xmath119 , the jt distortion @xmath120 persists down to @xmath76 . for @xmath11",
    "( but still taking @xmath57 ) , @xmath121 mev and @xmath122 . for @xmath123 , the jt distortion would increase the splitting of the @xmath124 doublet from @xmath125 mev to @xmath126 mev .",
    "when @xmath127 , the jt distortion is quenched at @xmath76 due to the strong orbital ordering .",
    "hence , we obtain both lower and upper jt transitions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . at the re - entrant jt transition , the distortion @xmath65 vanishes below @xmath12 and appears above @xmath12 .",
    "the temperature range @xmath128 decreases as @xmath3 increases and vanishes when @xmath129 .",
    "notice that the jt transitions at @xmath13 and @xmath12 always bracket @xmath7 .",
    "normalized by @xmath40 versus temperature @xmath130 for a range of @xmath3 in increments of 0.01 using @xmath131 and the elastic constants given in the text . ]    because the orbital contribution @xmath132 to the fe(ii ) moment drops as @xmath65 jumps at the re - entrant jt transition , @xmath12 is marked by a discontinuous change in @xmath46 . with decreasing @xmath3 , both",
    "the orbital contribution @xmath132 and the magnitude of the change in @xmath46 become smaller . for @xmath133 ,",
    "the re - entrant jt transition causes the average magnetization to change sign , as shown in fig.2(a ) for @xmath134 .     for @xmath134 and the experimental data of ref.@xcite",
    "( rescaled so that @xmath135 ) using @xmath131 and the elastic constants given in the text .",

    "the quantitative agreement in fig.3 between the theoretical prediction for @xmath134 and the measurements of ref.@xcite for a = n(n - c@xmath6h@xmath61)@xmath6 is striking . rather than providing evidence for two compensation points ,",
    "ref.@xcite indicates that a re - entrant jt transition occurs at @xmath138 k. according to fig.2(b ) , a normal jt transition will be found at @xmath139 k. indeed , recent x - ray measurements @xcite on the same compound confirm that the hexagonal symmetry present at room temperature is absent in the monoclinic lattice below 60 k.    measurements on several fe(ii)fe(iii ) compounds @xcite suggest that all mc compounds exhibit a small jump in the magnetization between @xmath7 and @xmath140 .",
    "the predicted jumps in fig.2(a ) are much too large to explain those measurements . x - ray diffraction studies @xcite reveal that stacking faults in several compounds promote the coexistence of two phases : one with a six - layer repeat and the other with a two - layer repeat . the small magnetization jumps observed @xcite in mc compounds",
    "are likely caused by a mixture of those two stacking types .",
    "as shown in the inset to fig.3 , a mixture of two phases , type 1 with @xmath141 ( 5% of the sample ) and type 2 with @xmath142 ( 95% of the sample ) @xcite , produces a small jump which is quite similar to the observations . the much larger jump observed by tang _",
    "@xcite may be caused by the greater fraction of type 1 ( @xmath143 ) stacking in their sample .    while there is no jt distortion ( @xmath144 ) when @xmath59",
    ", @xmath145 remains nonzero down to @xmath76 when @xmath57 and @xmath119 .",
    "so our model predicts that normal bimetallic oxalates with @xmath119 will not exhibit a discontinuity in the magnetization , which may explain why such a jump has never been observed in a normal compound @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , normal fe(ii)fe(iii ) compounds with @xmath57 ( so that the doublet remains lowest in energy ) should manifest a normal jt transition at @xmath146 or about 85 k.    but any non - c@xmath0-symmetric cation like n(n - c@xmath6h@xmath61)@xmath6 will also induce a permanent distortion of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "depending on the size and shape of the cation , this distortion can be local , weakly - correlated , or long - ranged .",
    "a non - c@xmath0-symmetric potential can be included within our model by changing the off - diagonal terms in @xmath69 from @xmath65 to @xmath147 . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling and a spontaneous jt distortion",
    "@xmath65 , the doublet splitting @xmath148 is then @xmath149 .",
    "since the anharmonic elastic potential proportional to @xmath150 favors @xmath151 , it acts to enhance the total distortion @xmath152 when @xmath153 and to suppress the total distortion when @xmath154 . for any nonzero @xmath155",

    "inset in ( a ) is the magnetization versus @xmath130 for @xmath158 between -0.5 and 0 in increments of 0.1 .",
    "these plots use @xmath159 , @xmath131 and the elastic constants given in the text . ]",
    "as shown in fig.4 for @xmath159 and the elastic parameters given earlier , increasing @xmath160 for a fixed @xmath3 decreases @xmath161 while keeping @xmath140 almost unchanged until @xmath162 .",
    "when @xmath163 mev , the spontaneous jt distortion @xmath65 at @xmath76 jumps to a value near @xmath164 mev and the lower jt transition disappears .",
    "when @xmath165 mev , the spontaneous jt transition is eliminated but magnetic compensation survives until @xmath166 mev , as seen in the inset to fig.4(a ) . except in the narrow window @xmath167 ,",
    "the permanent distortion @xmath155 and the electronic distortion @xmath65 have the same sign .",
    "clearly , the electronic jt distortion @xmath65 will vanish if the fe(ii ) singlet lies below the doublet with @xmath59 .",
    "so two conditions are required for c@xmath0 symmetry to remain unbroken at @xmath76 .",
    "first , the cation must preserve c@xmath0 symmetry so that there is no permanent distortion @xmath155 .",
    "second , either @xmath168 or if @xmath57 , the average orbital angular momentum @xmath3 of the doublet must be sufficiently large to quench the spontaneous jt distortion @xmath65 ( @xmath127 in fig.2 ) .",
    "specific examples of symmetry breaking will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in order to estimate the orders of magnitude of the spontaneous jt distortion @xmath65 and the permanent distortion @xmath160 , we performed a series of first - principles calculations within the framework of density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "we employed the local spin density approximation ( sda ) in the plane - wave - pseudopotential approach with the pbe @xcite exchange correlation functional as implemented in the quantum - espresso package @xcite .",
    "we used vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite including , in the case of fe @xcite , d electrons in the valence and non - linear core corrections .",
    "an energy cut - off of 45 ry was used .",
    "since the orbitals at the fermi level are very localized in this ionic solid , we used a single * k*-point .",
    "spin orbit coupling was not included . in order to stabilize the electronic density ,",
    "the calculations were performed with an electronic temperature of 0.02 ry or 270 mev .",
    "predictions of the experimental electronic and magnetic structure in highly localized systems are known to be significant challenges for most approximations of dft .",
    "indeed , we find that the energy difference between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations is below the resolution of our theory .",
    "moreover , the charge - density wave observed experimentally ( which results in inter - penetrated fe(ii ) and fe(iii ) networks ) is not found to be the ground state .",
    "this possibly signals the presence of strong self - interaction errors for the localized d orbitals @xcite .",
    "the antiferromagnetic fe(ii ) and fe(iii ) ordering is stabilized only after enforcing the net spin within each unit cell to be equal to 1/2 .",
    "calculations were performed for several possible stackings ( @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 ) of the bimetallic fe(ii)-fe(iii ) layers with a = n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 cations .",
    "the total energy differences between these stackings were below the accuracy of the theory , consistent with the high degree of polymorphism and the low energy cost for stacking faults suggested by the x - ray scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "since the relative energy difference @xmath173 between the doublet and singlet is quite sensitive to the stacking of the bimetallic planes , the angular momentum @xmath3 of the ground state may also depend on the stacking of the bimetallic planes .",
    "the doublet splittings and the order of magnitude of the jt distortions were estimated by focusing on a single bimetallic layer with different cations a. within hexagonal supercells , we studied the cations a = nh@xmath6 ( @xmath174 ) and n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "we also considered a = n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 ( @xmath176 ) in a non - hexagonal supercell .",
    "( @xmath174 ) although no oxalates contain the cation nh@xmath6 because it is too small to stabilize the open honeycomb lattice , calculations on this system allow us to estimate the jt distortion in a c@xmath0-symmetric environment .",
    "first , we relaxed the forces on all atoms constraining the symmetry to remain c@xmath0 .",
    "we found that the fermi level for the majority band lies at a doublet localized at the fe(ii ) sites and occupied by a single electron .",
    "this configuration is consistent with our model , which requires the partial occupation of a doublet to explain the mc and the jt distortion .",
    "second , we displaced the fe(ii ) ion from the symmetric position on a grid of points @xmath177 . from the _ ab - initio _ calculations , we extracted the total energy @xmath178 of the configuration and the energy splitting @xmath179 induced in the partially - occupied doublet . because the calculations where performed at an electronic temperature ( @xmath180 mev ) much larger than the splittings , both electronic levels of the doublet have an equal occupation of @xmath181 .",
    "at this large electronic temperature , no jt electronic energy was gained and the symmetric point @xmath182 remained the position with minimum energy , as expected .",
    "we can , however , estimate the energy gain at @xmath183 as @xmath184 .",
    "this approximation assumes that the total energy difference is given by the sum of the occupied eigenvalues at zero temperature and neglects a small change in the electronic density @xcite . with this expression ,",
    "we obtain the approximate fe(ii ) position and doublet splitting at zero temperature . in absence of the spin - orbit coupling",
    ", we estimate that the fe(ii ) moves @xmath185 ( the nearest - neighbor fe(ii)-fe(iii ) distance is about @xmath186 ) with an energy gain of 2 mev and a doublet spitting of 8 mev .",
    "this jt splitting is quite close to the spin - orbit coupling @xmath187 mev with @xmath159 .",
    "( @xmath175 ) moderately - sized cations such as n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 are themselves non - c@xmath0-symmetric and break the c@xmath0 symmetry of the crystal - field potential at the fe(ii ) sites .",
    "while it is possible to construct a n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 isomer with three c@xmath0h@xmath172 radicals below the oxalate plane , thereby preserving @xmath188 symmetry , the remaining propyl chain ( oriented towards the hexagonal hole in the oxalates plane ) must break c@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this symmetry violation produces a crystal - field splitting @xmath149 of the doublet and a permanent distortion of the open honeycomb lattice .",
    "calculations were performed in a hexagonal unit - cell containing a single a = n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 cation with periodic boundary conditions , corresponding to to an ordered configuration where every n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 cation is oriented in the same way . after relaxing the positions of the atoms",
    ", we obtained an intrinsic doublet splitting @xmath149 of about 10 mev at an electronic temperature of 270 mev .",
    "these calculations also indicate that the intrinsic distortion introduced by the cation will be increased at low temperature by the electronic energy gain of the fe(ii ) jt distortion .",
    "so in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath155 of our model have the same sign for this cation .",
    "( @xmath176 ) the molecule n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 is just small enough to allow individual cations to rotate independently of each other .",
    "hence , a uniform distortion of the crystal is possible .",
    "such a uniform distortion of the open honeycomb structure has been observed in bimetallic oxalates with radical cations @xcite .",
    "for an ordered arrangement of a = n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 cations and allowing the supercell to break hexagonal symmetry , we obtain a doublet splitting @xmath189 mev , which should increase to about 30 mev when the electronic temperature approaches zero .",
    "by contrast , larger cations such as a = n(n - c@xmath6h@xmath61)@xmath6 studied in ref.@xcite are unable to independently rotate within each unit cell . because they are locked into a highly - disordered configuration during synthesis",
    ", such cations will only break the local c@xmath0 symmetry around each fe(ii ) ion . since the spin - orbit coupling competes with the small , local lattice distortions ,",
    "magnetic compensation is still possible when the cations are large and disordered .",
    "this leads to an interesting conjecture : due to their ability to spatially order , smaller cations like n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 may be more effective at enhancing the departure from c@xmath0 symmetry and suppressing magnetic compensation than larger cations like n(n - c@xmath6h@xmath61)@xmath6 .",
    "our first - principles calculations imply that large cations like n(n - c@xmath6h@xmath61)@xmath6 will induce a substantial , local distortion @xmath190 of the hexagonal lattice . for smaller cations like n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6",
    ", this distortion may propagate throughout the bimetallic layer because the cations are able to reach a global minimum of the free energy , which is an ordered state at low temperatures . for an ordered configuration of n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6 cations with @xmath191 mev",
    ", the value suggested by our first - principles results , fig.4 implies that the re - entrant jt transition will be absent and any magnetic compensation will be very weak .",
    "indeed , n(n - c@xmath0h@xmath172)@xmath6[fe(ii)fe(iii)ox@xmath0 ] bimetallic oxalates @xcite show no signs of a jt transition or magnetic compensation below @xmath7 .    with the spin - orbit coupling set to zero ( @xmath11 ) , the doublet splitting @xmath192 mev obtained using the parameters of fig.3 is more than twice as large as that obtained from first - principles calculations in a c@xmath0-symmetric environment ( see @xmath174 above ) .",
    "so it is likely that the organic cation n(n - c@xmath6h@xmath61)@xmath6 plays a significant role in breaking the local c@xmath0 symmetry and enhancing the doublet splitting .",
    "a more sophisticated description of the experimental measurements may be possible once additional information about the atomic structure becomes available .    to summarize ,",
    "we have provided strong evidence for the existence of a re - entrant jt transition in the fe(ii)fe(iii ) bimetallic oxalates .",
    "observation of the jt distortion between @xmath138 k and @xmath193 k would provide unambiguous support for the predicted multiplet splitting in mc compounds .",
    "we hope that this work will inspire systematic x - ray scattering measurements that will verify the predictions made in this paper , including the long - range ordering of small , non - c@xmath0-symmetric cations in this important class of layered , molecule - based magnets .",
