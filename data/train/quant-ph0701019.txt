    "a computation , as usually understood , consists of operating on the state of some system ( or collection of systems ) in a sequence of steps . turing s universal computer",
    "consists of a sequence of operations on a tape . a classical computation is often implemented by having a sequence of operations on a collection of bits and a quantum computation by a sequence of operations on a collection of qubits .",
    "such computations can be built up of gates where each gate acts on a small number of bits or qubits .",
    "these gates are defined in terms of how they cause an input state to be evolved .",
    "a physical computer may have some spatial extension and so gates may be acting at many different places at once .",
    "nevertheless , we can always foliate spacetime such that we can regard the computer as acting on a state at some time @xmath3 and updating it to a new state at time @xmath4 , and so on , till the computation is finished .",
    "parallel computation fits into this paradigm since the different parts of the parallel computation are updated at the same time .",
    "the notion that computation proceeds by a sequence of time steps appears to be a fairly pervasive and deep rooted aspect of our understanding of what a computation is . in anticipation of more general computation , we will call computers that implement computation in this way _ step computers _ ( sc ) .",
    "this includes turing machines and parallel computers , and it includes classical computers and quantum computers .",
    "turing developed the theory of computation as a formalization of mathematical calculation ( with pencil , paper , and eraser for example)@xcite .",
    "deutsch later emphasized that any computation must be implemented physically @xcite .",
    "consequently , we must pay attention to physical theories to understand computation .",
    "currently , there are basically two fundamental physical theories , quantum theory ( qt ) and einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) for gravity .",
    "however , we really need a physical theory which is more fundamental - a theory of quantum gravity ( qg ) . a correct theory of qg will reduce to qt and gr in appropriate situations ( including , at least , those situations where those physical theories have been experimentally verified ) .",
    "we do not currently have a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "however , we can hope to gain some insight into what kind of theory this will be by looking at qt and gr . causal structure in gr is not fixed in advance . whether two events are time - like or not depends on the metric and the metric depends on the distribution of matter .",
    "in quantum theory a property that is subject to variation is also subject to quantum uncertainty - we can be in a situation where there is no matter of fact as to the value of that quantity .",
    "for example , a quantum particle can be in a superposition of being in two places at once .",
    "it seems likely that this will happen with causal structure .",
    "hence , in a theory of qg we expect that we will have indefinite causal structure .",

    "this is likely to have implications for computer science .",
    "in particular , it is likely that a quantum gravity computer can not be understood as an instance of a sc . in this paper",
    "we will explore the consequences of having indefinite causal structure for the theory of computation .",
    "in particular , we will look at how the causaloid framework ( developed in @xcite ) can be applied to provide a definite model for computation when we have indefinite causal structure .",
    "although there are compelling reasons for believing that the correct theory of qg will have indefinite causal structure , it is possible that this will not be the case .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we will assume that qg will have this property .",
    "there may be other features of a theory of qg which would be interesting for the study of computation but , in this paper , we will restrict ourselves to indefinite causal structure .",
    "the idea of a computer comes from attempting to formalize mathematical calculation .",
    "a limited notion of computation would entail that it is nothing more than a process by which a sequence of symbols is updated in a deterministic fashion - such as with a turing machine .",
    "however , with the advent of quantum computation , this notion is no longer sufficient .",
    "david deutsch was able to establish a theory of quantum computation which bares much resemblance to the theory of classical computation . given that quantum computers can be imagined ( and may even be built one day ) we need a richer notion of computation .",
    "however , a quantum computer still proceeds by means of a sequence of time steps .",
    "it is a sc .",
    "the possibility of considering time steps at a fundamental level will , we expect , be undermined in a theory of quantum gravity for the reasons given above .",
    "this raises the question of whether or not we want to regard the behaviour of a physical machine for which the particular effects of qg are important and lead to indefinite causal structure as constituting a computer . we could certainly build a machine of this nature ( at least in principle )",
    "furthermore , somebody who knows the laws by which this machine operates could use it to address mathematical issues ( at the very least they could solve efficiently the mathematical problem of generating numbers which would be produced by a simulation of this machine in accordance with the known laws ) .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to regard this machine as a computer - a quantum gravity computer .    at this point",
    "it is worth taking a step back to ask , in the light of these considerations , what we mean by a the notion of a computer in general ?",
    "one answer is that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\(1 ) * a computer * is a physical device that can give correct answers to well formulated questions . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    for this to constitute a complete definition we would need to say what the terms in this definition mean .",
    "however , whatever a well formulated question `` means , it must be presented to the computer in the form of some physical input ( or program ) . likewise , whatever an answer '' is , it must be given by the computer in the form of some physical output .",
    "it is not clear what the notion of correctness \" means .",
    "however , from the point of view of the physical computer it must mean that the device operates according to sufficiently well known rules .",
    "hence , a more physical definition is that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\(2 ) * a computer * is a physical device has an output that depends on an input ( or program ) according to sufficiently well known rules . _",

    "it is not necessary that we know all the physics that governs a computer .",
    "for example , in a classical computer we do not need to have a detailed understanding of the physics inside a gate , we only need an understanding of how the gate acts on an input to produce an output .",
    "there remain interesting philosophical questions about how we understand the translation from the terms in definition ( 1 ) to those in definition ( 2 ) but these go beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "these definitions are useful .",
    "in particular they do not require that the computational process proceed by a sequence of steps .",
    "we will see how we can meaningfully talk about computation in the absence of any spacelike foliation into timelike steps in the sense of definition ( 2 ) of a computer .",
    "it is likely that , in going to qg computers , we will leave behind many of the more intuitive notions of computation we usually take for granted .",
    "this already happened in the transition from classical to quantum computation - but the the likely failure of the step computation model for a qg computer may cause the transition from quantum to quantum gravity computation to be even more radical .",

    "deutsch s statement emphasizes the physical aspect of computation whereas church and turing were more interested in mathematical issues ( note that , in his acknowledgements , deutsch thanks c.  h.  bennett for pointing out to me that the church - turing hypothesis has physical significance \" ) .",
    "we can take the widespread successful simulation of any number of physical processes ( such as of cars in a wind tunnel , or of bridges prior to their being built ) on a modern classical computer , as evidence of the truth of this principle .",
    "a principle like this would seem to be important since it provides a mechanism for verifying physical theories .",
    "the physical theory tells us how to model physical processes . to verify the physical theory there",
    "needs to be some way of using the theory to simulate the given physical process .",
    "however , there is a deeper reason that this principle is interesting .",
    "this is that it might lead us to say that the universe is , itself , a computer .",
    "of course , the ctd principle does not actually imply that . even though we might be able to simulate a physical process on a computer",

    "we will not attempt to provide a precise definition but rather will illustrated our discussion with examples .",
    "nevertheless , accurate reflection \" would entail that not only is there the same mapping between inputs and outputs for the physical process and the computation , but also that there is a mapping between the internal structure of the physical process and the computation .",
    "this relates to ideas of functional equivalence as discussed by philosophers .",
    "we may think of a universal computer in the turing model where the program is included in the tape .",
    "but we may also use the circuit model where the program is represented by a prespecified way of choosing the gates .",
    "it is possible to simulate any quantum system with a finite dimensional hilbert space ( including quantum computers ) to arbitrary accuracy on a classical computer .",
    "in fact , we can even simulate a quantum computer with polynomial space on a classical computer but , in general , this requires exponential time @xcite .",
    "we might claim , then , that the ctd principle holds ( though , since this is not exact simulation , we may prefer to withhold judgment ) .",
    "however , we would be more reluctant to claim that the cr principle holds since the classical simulation has properties that the quantum process does not : ( i ) it is possible to measure the state of the classical computer without effecting its subsequent evolution ; ( ii ) the exponential time classical computer is much more powerful than a polynomial time quantum computer ; and ( iii ) the detailed structure of the classical computation will look quite different to that of the quantum process .",
    "the idea of a state which evolves is deeply ingrained in our way of thinking about the world .",
    "but is it a necessary feature of any physical theory ?",
    "this depends what a physical theory must accomplish . at the very least ,",
    "_ a physical theory must correlate recorded data_. data is correlated in the evolving state picture in the following way .",
    "data corresponding to a given time is correlated by applying the mathematical machinery of the theory to the state at that given time . and data corresponding to more than one time is correlated by evolving the state through those given times , and then applying the mathematical machinery of the theory to the collection of states so generated . however , there is no reason to suppose that this is the only way of correlating data taken in different spacetime regions .",
    "in fact , we have already other pictures .",
    "in gr we solve local field equations .",
    "a solution must simply satisfy the einstein field equations and be consistent with the boundary conditions .",
    "we do not need the notion of an evolving state here - though there are canonical formulations of gr which have a state across space evolving in time .",
    "in classical mechanics we can extremise an action . in this case",
    "we consider possible solutions over all time and find the one that extremizes the action .",
    "again , we do not need to use the notion of an evolving state .",
    "in quantum theory we can use feynman s sum over histories approach which is equivalent to an evolving state picture but enables us to proceed without such a picture . in @xcite",
    "the causaloid formalism was developed as a candidate framework for a theory of qg ( though qt can be formulated in this framework ) .",
    "this enables one to calculate directly whether ( i ) there is a well defined correlation between data taken from two different spacetime regions and , if there is , ( ii ) what that correlation is equal to . since this calculation is direct",
    ", there is no need to consider a state evolving between the two regions .",
    "the causaloid formalism is , in particular , suited to dealing with the situation where there is no matter of fact to whether an interval is time - like or not .",
    "a quantum gravity computer is a computer for which the particular effects of qg are important . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the case where we have indefinite causal structure ( and , of course , we are assuming that qg will allow this property ) .    as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ whatcounts ] , a computer can be understood to be a physical device having an output that depends on an input ( or program ) according to sufficiently well known rules .",
    "the computer occupies a certain region of spacetime .",
    "the input can consist of a number of inputs into the computer distributed across this region , and likewise , the output can consist of a number of outputs from the computer distributed across the region . typically the inputs are selected ( by us ) in accordance with some program corresponding to the question we wish to use the computer to find an answer to .",
    "usually we imagine setting the computer in some initial state ( typically , in quantum computing , this consists of putting all the qubits in the zero state ) .",
    "however , physically this is accomplished by an appropriate choice of inputs prior to this initial time ( for example , we might have a quantum circuit which initializes the state ) .",
    "hence , the picture in which we have inputs and outputs distributed across the given region of spacetime is sufficient .",
    "we do not need to also imagine that we separately initialize the computer .",
    "this characterization of a computer is useful for specifying a qg computer since we must be careful using a notion like initial state \" when we can not rely on having a definite notion of a single time hypersurface in the absence of definite causal structure .",
    "the qg computer itself must be sensitive to qg effects ( as opposed to purely quantum or purely general relativistic effects ) . to actually build a qg computer",
    "we need a theory of quantum gravity because ( i ) this is the only way to be sure we are seeing quantum gravity effects and ( ii ) we need to have known physical laws to use the device as a computer .    in the absence of a theory of",
    "qg it is difficult to give an example of a device which will function as a qg computer",
    ". nevertheless we will give a possible candidate example for the purposes of discussion .",
    "we hope that the essential features of this example would be present in any actual qg computer .",
    "we imagine , for this example , that our quantum gravity computer consists of a number of mesoscopic probes of planck mass ( about 20 micrograms ) immersed in a controlled environment of smaller quantum objects ( such as photons ) .",
    "there must be the possibility of having inputs and outputs .",
    "the inputs and outputs are distributed across the region of spacetime in which the qg computer operates .",
    "we take this region of spacetime to be fuzzy in the sense that we can not say whether a particular interval in it is time - like or space - like .",
    "however , we can still expect to be able to set up physical coordinates to label where a particular input or output is located `` in some appropriate abstract space . for example ,",
    "imagine that a gps system is set up by positioning four satellites around the region .",
    "each satellite emits a signal carrying the time of its internal clock .",
    "we imagine that the mesoscopic probes can detect these four times thus providing a position @xmath5 .",
    "each satellite clock will tick and so @xmath6 is a discrete variable .",
    "a given probe will experience a number of different values of @xmath6 .",
    "assume that each probe can be set to give out a light pulse or not ( denote this by @xmath7 or @xmath8 respectively ) , and has a detector which may detect a photon or not ( denote this by @xmath9 or @xmath10 respectively ) during some given short time interval . further , allow the value of @xmath11 to depend on @xmath6 .",
    "thus , @xmath12 where @xmath13 labels the probe .",
    "we imagine that we can choose the function @xmath14 as we like .",
    "this constitutes the program .",
    "thus , the inputs are given by the @xmath11 s and the outputs by the @xmath15 s .",
    "we record many instances of the data @xmath16 .",
    "we might like to have more complicated programs where @xmath14 is allowed to depend on the values of previous outputs from other probes .",
    "however , we can not assume that there is fixed causal structure , and so we can not say , in advance , what will constitute previous data . thus , any program of this nature must physicalize '' the previous data by alowing the probe to emit it as a physical signal , @xmath17 .",
    "if this signal is detected at a probe along with @xmath6 then it can form part of the input into @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we would have @xmath18 at the end of a run of the qg computer , we would have many instances of @xmath19 .",
    "this is just a possible example of a possible qg computer .",
    "we might have the property of indefinite causal structure in this example since the mesoscopic probes are ( possibly ) sufficiently small to allow quantum effects and sufficiently massive to allow gravitational effects .",
    "cat @xcite consists of exploring the possible gravity induced breakdown of quantum theory for a planck mass mirror recoiling ( or not ) from a photon in a quantum superposition .",
    "regardless of whether this is a good example , we will assume that any such computer will collect data of the form @xmath20 ( or @xmath19 ) , and that a program can be specified by a function @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) .",
    "whilst we can imagine more complicated examples , it would seem that they add nothing extra and could , anyway , be accommodated by the foregoing analysis .",
    "importantly , although we have the coordinate @xmath6 , we do not assume any causal structure on @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , there is no need to assume that some function of @xmath6 will provide a time coordinate - this need not be a sc .",
    "we will now given an abbreviated presentation of the causaloid formalism which is designed for analyzing data collected in this way and does not require a time coordinate .",
    "this formalism was first presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for more accessible accounts ) .",
    "assume that each piece of data ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) once collected is written on a card .",
    "at the end of the computation we will have a stack of cards .",
    "we will seek to find a way to calculate probabilistic correlations between the data collected on these cards .",
    "the order in which the cards end up in the stack does not , in itself , constitute recorded data and consequently will play no role in this analysis .",
    "since we are interested in probabilities we will imagine running the computation many times so that we can calculate probabilities as relative frequencies ( though , this may not be necessary for all applications of the computer ) .",
    "now we will provide a number of basic definitions in terms of the cards .",
    "the full pack , : :    @xmath25 , is the set of all logically possible cards .",
    "the program , : :    @xmath14 , is the set of all cards from @xmath25    consistent with a given program @xmath26 ( or    @xmath27 ) .",
    "note that the set @xmath14 and the function    @xmath14 convey the same information so we use the same    notation , the meaning being clear from the context . a stack , : :    @xmath28 , is the set of cards collected during a particular run    of the computer .",
    "an elementary region , : :    @xmath29 , is the the set of all cards from @xmath25    having a particular @xmath6 written on them .    note that @xmath30 we will now give a few more definitions in terms of these basic definitions .",
    "regions . : :    we define a composite spacetime region by    @xmath31 we will    often denote this by @xmath32 for shorthand . the outcome set in region : :    @xmath32 is given by    @xmath33 this set contains the    results seen in the region @xmath32 .",
    "it constitutes the raw    output data from the computation .",
    "we will often denote this set by    @xmath34 .",
    "the program in region : :    @xmath32 is given by    @xmath35 this set contains the    program instructions in region @xmath32 .",
    "we will often denote    it by @xmath36 .",
    "we will consider probabilities of the form @xmath37 this is the probability that we see outcome set @xmath38 in @xmath39 given that we have procedure @xmath40 in that region and that we have outcome set @xmath34 and program @xmath36 in region @xmath32 .",
    "our physical theory must ( i ) determine whether the probability is _ well defined _ , and if so ( ii ) determine its value .",
    "the first step is crucial .",
    "most conditional probabilities we might consider are not going to be well defined .",
    "for example if @xmath32 and @xmath39 are far apart ( in so much as such a notion makes sense ) then there will be other influences ( besides those in @xmath32 ) which determine the probabilities of outcomes in @xmath39 , and if these are not take into account we can not do a calculation for this probability . to illustrate this imagine an adversary .",
    "whatever probability we write down , he can alter these extraneous influences so that the probability is wrong .",
    "conventionally we determine whether a probability is well defined by simply looking at the causal structure .",
    "however , since we do not have definite causal structure here we have to be more careful .    to begin we will make an assumption .",
    "let the region @xmath41 be big ( consisting of most of @xmath25 ) .",
    "assumption 1 : : :    we assume that there is some condition @xmath42 on    @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that all    probabilities of the form @xmath45 are    well defined .",
    "we can regard condition @xmath42 as corresponding to the setting up and maintenance of the computer .",
    "we will consider only cases where @xmath42 is true ( when it is not , the computer is broken or malfunctioning ) .",
    "we will regard region @xmath41 as the region in which the computation is performed .",
    "since we will always be assuming @xmath42 is true , we will drop it from our notation .",
    "thus , we assume that the probabilities @xmath46 are well defined .",
    "the probabilities @xmath46 pertain to the global region @xmath41 . however , we normally like to do physics by building up a picture of the big from the small",
    ". we will show how this can be done .",
    "we will apply three levels of _ physical compression_. the first applies to single regions ( such as @xmath32 ) .",
    "the second applies to composite regions such as @xmath47 ( the second level of physical compression also applies to composite regions made from three or more component regions ) .",
    "the first and second levels of physical compression result in certain matrices . in the third level of physical compression",
    "we use the fact that these matrices are related to implement further compression .",
    "first we implement _ first level physical compression_. we label each possible pair @xmath48 in @xmath32 with @xmath49 .",
    "we will think of these pairs as describing measurement outcomes in @xmath32 ( @xmath50 denotes the outcome of the measurement and @xmath51 denotes the choice of measurement ) .",
    "then we write @xmath52 by assumption 1 , these probabilities are all well defined .",
    "we can think of what happens in region @xmath53 as constituting a generalized preparation of a state in region @xmath32 .",
    "we define the state to be that thing represented by any mathematical object which can be used to calculate @xmath54 for all @xmath49 .",
    "now , given a generalized preparation , the @xmath54 s are likely to be related by the physical theory that governs the system .",
    "in fact we can just look at linear relationships .",
    "this means that we can find a minimal set @xmath55 such that @xmath56 where the state @xmath57 in @xmath32 is given by @xmath58 we will call @xmath55 the fiducial set ( of measurement outcomes ) . note that the probabilities @xmath59 need not add up to 1 since the @xmath60 s may correspond to outcomes of incompatible measurements . in the case that there are no linear relationships relating the @xmath54 s we set @xmath55 equal to the full set of @xmath49 s and then @xmath61 consists of a 1 in position @xmath49 and 0 s elsewhere . hence , we can always write ( [ firstlevel ] ) .",
    "one justification for using linear compression is that probabilities add in a linear way when we take mixtures .",
    "it is for this reason that linear compression in quantum theory ( for general mixed states ) is the most efficient .",

    "the causaloid diagram is also necessary so we know how the nodes are linked up and how the ( qu)bits move .",
    "there is quite substantial third level compression .",
    "the total number of possible @xmath99 matrices is exponential in the number of nodes but the number of matrices required to specify the causaloid is only linear in this number .",

    "then it is easy to show that @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the angle between @xmath128 and @xmath127 ( we get these bounds using @xmath132 ) .      in setting up the causaloid formalism we have not had to assume that we can have a state which evolves with respect to time . as we will see",
    ", it is possible to reconstruct an evolving state even though this is looks rather unnatural from point of view of the causaloid formalism .",
    "however , this reconstruction depends on assumption 1 of sec .",
    "[ objectiveof ] being true .",
    "it is consistent to apply the causaloid formalism even if assumption 1 does not hold . in this case",

    "we can do this for _ any _ such nested set of regions .",
    "there is no need for the partitioning to be generated by a foliation into spacelike hypersurfaces and , indeed , such a foliation will not exist if the causal structure is indefinite .",
    "this evolving state is rather artificial - it need not correspond to any physically motivated time \" .",
    "there is a further reason to be suspicious of an evolving state in the causaloid formalism . to set up this formalism it was necessary to make assumption 1 ( in sec .",
    "[ objectiveof ] ) .",
    "it is likely that this assumption will not be strictly valid in a theory of qg .",
    "however , we can regard this assumption as providing scaffolding to get us to a mathematical framework .",

    "thus it is possible that we can define a causaloid and then use the causaloid product and ( [ parallelness ] , [ pgivenby ] ) to calculate whether probabilities are well defined and , if so , what these probabilities are equal to . in",
    "so doing we need make no reference to the concept of state . in particular , since we can not suppose that all the probabilities @xmath147 are well defined , we will not be able to force an evolving state picture .",
    "the causaloid formalism provides us with a way of correlating inputs and outputs across a region of space time even in the absence of the possibility of an evolving state picture .",
    "in the standard circuit model a computer is constructed out of gates selected from a small set of possible gates .",
    "the gates are distributed throughout a spacetime region in the form of a circuit .",
    "hence we have a number of spacetime locations ( label them by @xmath6 ) at which we may place a gate . at each such location",
    "we have a choice of which gate to select .",
    "the gates are connected by wires \" along which ( qu)bits travel .",
    "this wiring represents the causal structure of the circuit .",
    "since the wiring is well defined , causal structure can not be said to be indefinite .",
    "in fact in classical and quantum computers we can work with a fixed wiring and vary only the choice of gates .",
    "the wires can form a diamond grid like that shown in fig .  1 . where the wires cross two ( qu)bits can pass through a gate . as long as we have a sufficient number of appropriate gates we can perform universal computation . in sec .",
    "[ classicalquantum ] we outlined how to put this situation into the causaloid formalism .    in the causaloid model we have spacetime locations labeled by @xmath6",

    "this choice of setting can be regarded as constituting the choice of a gate . since we may have indefinite causal structure we will not be able to think in terms of wiring \" as such .",
    "however information about the causal connections between what happens at different @xmath6 s is given by the @xmath99 matrices which can be calculated from the causaloid .",
    "for example the matrix @xmath148 tells us about the causal connection between @xmath6 and @xmath149 by quantifying second level compression .",
    "thus , the matrices associated with second level compression ( which can be deduced from the causaloid , @xmath150 ) play the role of wiring . since we do not have wires we can not necessarily think in terms of ( qu)bits moving between gates .",
    "rather , we must think of the gates as being immersed in an amorphous interconnected sea quantitatively described by the causaloid . in the special case of a classical or quantum",
    "computer we will have wiring and this can be deduced from @xmath0 .",
    "typically , in computers , we restrict the set of gates we employ .",
    "thus , assume that we restrict to @xmath151 where @xmath2 is a subset of the set , @xmath152 , of all possible @xmath11 .",
    "then a computer is defined by the pair @xmath153 the program for this computer is given by some function like @xmath154 ( or @xmath155 ) from sec .",
    "[ whatis ] where @xmath156 .",
    "this is a very general model for computation .",
    "both classical and quantum computers can be described in this way as well as computers with indefinite causal structure .",
    "imagine we have a class of computers .",
    "a universal computer for this class is a member of the class which can be used to simulate any computer in the class if it is supplied with an appropriate program .",
    "for example , a universal turing machine can be used to simulate an arbitrary turing machine .",
    "this is done by writing the program for the turing machine to be simulated into the first part of the tape that is fed into the universal turing machine .",
    "it follows from their definition that universal computers can simulate each other .",
    "given a causaloid , @xmath0 and some integer @xmath157 we can generate an interesting class of computers - namely the class @xmath158 defined as the class of computers @xmath1 for all @xmath159 such that @xmath160 .",
    "we will typically be interested in the case that @xmath157 is a fairly small number ( less than 10 say ) .",
    "the reason for wanting @xmath157 to be small is that usually we imagine computations being constructed out of a small set of basic operations .",
    "we can then ask whether there exist any universal computers in this class .",
    "we will say that the computer @xmath161 with @xmath162 is universal for the class @xmath158 if we can use it to simulate an arbitrary computer in this class .",
    "this means that there must exist a simple map from inputs and outputs of the universal computer to inputs and outputs ( respectively ) of the computer being simulated such that the probabilities are equal ( or equal to within some specified accuracy ) .",
    "we will then refer to @xmath163 as a universal set of gates .    if we choose the causaloid @xmath0 of classical or quantum theory discussed in sec .",
    "[ classicalquantum ] then it is well established that there exist universal computers for small @xmath157 .",
    "this is especially striking in the quantum case since there exist a infinite number of gates which can not be simulated by probabilistic mixtures of other gates .",
    "one way to understand how this is possible in the classical and quantum cases is the following .",
    "imagine that we want to simulate @xmath1 with @xmath164 .",
    "we can show that any gate in the set @xmath2 can be simulated to arbitrary accuracy with some number of gates from the set @xmath163 . then we can coarse - grain on the diamond grid to larger diamonds which can have sufficient gates from @xmath163 to simulate an arbitrary gate in @xmath2 .",
    "in coarse - graining in this way we do not change in any significant way the nature of the causal structure .",
    "thus we can still link these coarse - grained diamonds to each other in such a way that we can simulate @xmath1 .",
    "this works because , in classical and quantum theory , we have definite causal structure which has a certain scale invariance property as we coarse - grain",
    ".    however , if we start with a class of computers @xmath158 generated by a causaloid , @xmath0 , for which there is indefinite causal structure , then we do not expect this scale invariance property under coarse - graining .",
    "in particular , we would expect , as we go to larger diamonds , that the causal structure will become more definite .",
    "hence we may not be able to arrange the same kind of causal connection between the simulated versions of the gates in @xmath2 as between the original versions of these gates .",
    "hence , we can not expect that the procedure just described for simulation in the classical and quantum case will work in the case of a general causaloid .",
    "this suggests that the concept of universal computation is may not be applicable in qg .",
    "however the situation is a little more subtle .",
    "the classical physics that is required to set up classical computation should be a limiting case of any theory of qg .",
    "if a given causaloid , @xmath150 , corresponds to qg then we expect that it is possible to use this to simulate a universal classical computer if we coarse - grain to a classical scale .",
    "we can also build random number generator since we have probabilistic processes ( since qt is also a limiting case ) .",
    "this suggests a way to simulate ( in some sense of the word ) a general qg computer in the class corresponding to @xmath150 . we can use the classical computer to calculate whether probabilities are well defined and , if so , what they are equal to arbitrary accuracy from the causaloid by programming in the equations of the causaloid formalism .",
    "we can then use the random number generator to provide outputs with the given probabilities thus simulating what we would see with a genuine qg computer .",
    "we might question whether this is genuine simulation since there will not necessarily be a simple correspondence between the spacetime locations of these outputs in the simulation and the outputs in the actual qg computation .",
    "in addition , in simulating the classical computer from the quantum gravitational @xmath0 , we may need a gate set @xmath2 with very large @xmath157 .",
    "nevertheless , one might claim that the church turing deutsch principle is still true .",
    "however , it seems that the computational reflection principle is under considerable strain . in particular",
    ", the classical simulation would have definite causal structure unlike the qg computer .",
    "but also the detailed causal structure of the classical simulation would look quite different from that of the qg computer it simulates .",
    "there may also be computational complexity issues . with such issues in mind",
    "we might prefer to use the qg causaloid to simulate a universal quantum computer ( instead of a universal classical computer ) and then use this to model the equations of the causaloid formalism to simulate the original causaloid .",
    "this may be quicker than a classical computer .",
    "however , the computational power of a qg computer may go significantly beyond that of a quantum computer ( see sec.[willqg ] ) .    if the computational reflection principle is undermined for qg processes then we may not be able to think that the world is , itself , a computational process . even if we widen our understanding of what we mean by computation , it is possible that we will not be able to define a useful notion of a universal computer that is capable of simulating all fundamental quantum gravitational processes in a way that accurately reflects what is happening in the world .",
    "this would have an impact on any research program to model fundamental physics as computation ( such as that of lloyd @xcite ) as well as having wider philosophical implications .      whether or not we can define a useful notion of universal qg computation , it is still possible that a qg computer will have greater computational power than a quantum computer ( and , therefore , a classical computer )",
    "are there any reasons for believing this ?    typically we are interested in how computational resources scale with the input size for a class of problems .",
    "for example we might want to factorize a number .",
    "then the input size is equal to the number of bits required to represent this number . to talk about computational power",
    "we need to a way of measuring resources .",
    "computer scientists typically make much use of space and time as separate resources .",
    "time is equal to the number of steps required to complete the calculation and space is equal to the maximum number of ( qu)bits required .",

    "problems in p are regarded as being easy and those which are not in @xmath165 are regarded as being hard .",
    "motivated by the classical case , @xmath166 is the class of decision problems which can be solved with bounded error on a quantum computer in polynomial time",
    ". bounded error means that the error must be , at most , @xmath167 .",
    "we need to allow errors since we are dealing with probabilistic machines .",
    "however , by repeating the computation many times we can increase our certainty whilst still only requiring only polynomial time .    in qg computation with indefinite causal structure we can not talk about space and time as separate resources .",
    "we can only talk of the spacetime resources required to complete a calculation .",
    "the best measure of the spacetime resources is the number of locations @xmath6 ( where gates are chosen ) that are used in the computation .",
    "thus , if we have @xmath168 for a computation then @xmath169 .    in standard computation ,",
    "the space used by a computer with polynomial time is , itself , only going to be at most polynomial in the input size ( since , in the computational models used by computer scientists , space can only increase as a polynomial function of the number of steps ) .",

    "hence , we can usefully work with spacetime rather than time as our basic resource .",
    "we define the class of problems @xmath170 which can be solved with bounded error on the computer @xmath171 in polynomial spacetime .",
    "the interesting question , then , is whether there are problems which are in @xmath170 but not in bqp for some appropriate choice of computer @xmath172 .",
    "the important property that a qg computer will have that is not possessed by a quantum ( or classical ) computer is that we do not have fixed causal structure .",
    "this means that , with respect to any attempted foliation into spacelike hypersurfaces , there will be backward in time influences .",
    "this suggests that a qg computer will have some _ insight _ into its future state ( of course , the terminology is awkward here since we do not really have a meaningful notion of future \" ) .",
    "it is possible that this will help from a computational point of view .    a different way of thinking about this question is to ask whether a qg computer will be hard to simulate on a quantum computer .",

    "hence , to specify the state , @xmath141 , we need only list probabilities pertaining to the time - slice @xmath173 rather than all of @xmath133 .",
    "the number of probabilities required to specify @xmath141 ( i.e. the number of entries in this vector ) is therefore much smaller than it might be if we needed to specify probabilities pertaining to more of the region @xmath133 .",
    "if , however , we have indefinite causal structure , then we can not expect to have this property .",

    ". we might want to use such qg effects to implement computation .",
    "however , if there is no definite causal structure we must depart from the usual notion of a computation as corresponding to taking a physical machine through a time ordered sequence of steps - a qg computer will likely not be a step computer .",

    "<S> a quantum gravity computer is one for which the particular effects of quantum gravity are relevant . in general relativity , causal structure is non - fixed . in quantum theory </S>",
    "<S> non - fixed quantities are subject to quantum uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore likely that , in a theory of quantum gravity , we will have indefinite causal structure . </S>",

    "<S> classical and quantum computations consist in evolving the state of the computer through a sequence of time steps . </S>",
    "<S> this will , most likely , not be possible for a quantum gravity computer because the notion of a time step makes no sense if we have indefinite causal structure . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to set up a model for computation even in the absence of definite causal structure by using a certain framework ( the causaloid formalism ) that was developed for the purpose of correlating data taken in this type of situation . </S>",

    "<S> a computer is given by the pair @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a set of gates . </S>",
    "<S> working within the causaloid formalism , we explore the question of whether universal quantum gravity computers are possible . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine whether a quantum gravity computer might be more powerful than a quantum ( or classical ) computer . in particular , we ask whether indefinite causal structure can be used as a computational resource . </S>"
