    "the outburst of v445 puppis was discovered on 30 december 2000 by kanatsu @xcite .",
    "the spectrum shows absence of hydrogen , enrichments of helium and carbon .",
    "optical spectrum is not yet published in full papers , but near infrared spectra confirm the absence of paschen and brackett hydrogen lines ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "light curves reported by vsnet show its small amplitude of the outburst ( @xmath4 ) and the shape of light curve which do not resemble those of classical novae , recurrent novae or other cataclysmic variables . from these unique properties , this object is suggested to be a helium nova @xcite .",
    "infrared observations suggest dust formation . during the outburst , infrared spectra",
    "consistent with dust emission are observed on 2001 jan 2 , jd  2,451,912 @xcite , and on 2001 jan 31 , jd  2,451,941 @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the thermal emission comes from dust formed during the 2000 outburst , while @xcite claimed that it comes from a preexisting dust shell of a previous outburst .",
    "@xcite reported that v445 pup was fainter than @xmath5 on 2001 october 4 , jd  2,452,187 , with a remark that the object is evidently shrouded by a thick and dense carbon dust shell .",
    "@xcite reached the same conclusion based on the @xmath6 observation on 2001 november 1 , jd  2,452,215 . to summarize , an optically thin dust shell exists on the outburst phase , and a thick dust shell",
    "is formed 80 days after the star fades away .",
    "helium novae have been theoretically predicted by @xcite as a nova outburst phenomenon caused by helium shell flash on a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "they considered two cases of helium accretion ; a helium accretor from the companion helium star , or a hydrogen - rich matter accretion from a normal companion with a high accretion rate . in the latter case ,",
    "a part of hydrogen - rich matter accreted is processed into helium and it accumulates on the wd . when the mass of the helium layer reaches a critical mass , an unstable weak helium shell flash occurs .",
    "this is the helium nova . in a helium nova ,",
    "mass loss owing to optically thick wind is relatively weak , and most of the helium envelope burns into carbon and oxygen , and accumulates on the wd @xcite . through many periodic helium shell flashes ,",
    "the wd gradually grows in mass and ends up an accretion induced collapse to a neutron star or explodes as a type ia supernova @xcite .    in this @xmath7",
    ", we present light curve modeling of v445 pup and show that this object is indeed a helium nova on a massive wd .",
    "we also estimate the helium accretion rate and the recurrence period of outbursts .",
    "the decay phase of helium nova outbursts can be followed by using an optically thick wind theory @xcite .",
    "the structure of the wd envelope is calculated by solving the equations of motion , continuity , energy transport , and energy conservation .",
    "the details of computation have been already presented in @xcite for helium shell flashes on a @xmath0 wd . here , other various wd masses are examined that are 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.33 , 1.35 , and @xmath8 . for the 1.1 and 1.2 @xmath9 wds",
    ", we assume the chandrasekhar radius , and for the 1.3 @xmath9 wd , we adopt the radius of helium burning zone , @xmath10 , in @xcite . for more massive wds , we adopt the radius of accreting wds @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 wd is a limiting case of mass - accreting wds just before a central carbon ignition @xcite .",
    "the composition of the envelope is assumed to be uniform with @xmath11 for @xmath12 , which is taken from @xcite , and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "changing the ratio of carbon to oxygen with the total mass ratio constant @xmath15const . )",
    "hardly changes the result .",
    "opal opacity is used .",
    "figure 1 shows the photospheric temperature @xmath16 , the photospheric wind velocity @xmath17 , the photospheric radius @xmath18 , the wind mass loss rate and the total mass decreasing rate of the envelope ( the wind mass loss rate plus the nuclear burning rate ) . at the maximum expansion",
    ", the star reaches somewhere on the curve depending on the envelope mass , and moves leftward in time .",
    "the wind mass loss stops at the point marked by the small open circles .",
    "after that the star further moves leftward owing to nuclear burning . the solution of @xmath0 is already presented in @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows theoretical light curves corresponding to the models in figure 1 .",
    "a more massive wd shows a more rapid decline because of a smaller helium envelope mass as shown in figure 1 .",
    "difference in the chemical composition , for example , @xmath19 and @xmath20 on the @xmath0 wd , hardly changes the theoretical light curves as shown in figure 2 ( see the difference between the dotted curve and the solid curve ) .",
    "after the onset of a helium shell flash the star brightens up and reaches somewhere on the theoretical curve and moves rightward on the curve in time ( figure 2 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath21 in these template light curves is not the onset of ignition of a particular object .",
    "the first point is determined by the ignition mass , i.e. , the envelope mass at helium ignition for an individual object .",
    "if it is more massive , it first appears much lefter - side on the light curve , and the outburst lasts for a longer time .",
    "the @xmath22-magnitude decreases slowly in the early stage and goes down quickly in the later stage .",
    "especially after the wind stops at the point denoted by asterisk , the star quickly fades away .",
    "the helium burning stops at the last point of each curve .",
    "observational data of v445 pup , taken from vsnet , is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the mean decreasing rate of v445 pup is about @xmath23 ( mag  day@xmath3 ) .",
    "the light curves of the 1.1 and @xmath24 wd decline too slow to be compatible with the observation even if we choose any parts of their light curves . on the other hand ,",
    "we are able to fit a part of our theoretical light curves for more massive than @xmath0 wd to the observational data .",
    "thus , we may conclude that v445 pup has a wd more massive than @xmath0 .    to fit the vertical axis of the light curves , we obtain an apparent distance modulus of @xmath25 as shown in figure 3 . the horizontal axis ( time )",
    "is also shifted to fit the data .",
    "here we adopt a middle part of our theoretical light curves around @xmath26 that has a decline rate of @xmath27 ( mag  day@xmath3 ) .",
    "a slow decline lasts longer than 200 days and the brightness suddenly drops .",
    "this point corresponds to the cease point of the optically thick wind .",
    "after the wind mass loss stops , the photosphere shrinks very rapidly .",
    "this feature is also shown in theoretical light curves for classical novae @xcite and recurrent novae @xcite of very massive wds .",
    "this also appears in theoretical light curves of helium novae .",
    "all the theoretical curves of @xmath28 are almost similar until jd  2,452,100 , and deviate from each other after that day .",
    "the light curve of 1.1 @xmath9 is too slow to decline and it should be excluded in the following discussion .",
    "we also think that the 1.2 and @xmath0 wds do not meet the upper limit ( arrows ) of the observational data after jd  2,452,100 .",
    "finally , we adopt the conclusion that v445 pup has a massive ( @xmath29 ) wd .",
    "v445 pup shows a quick decrease in the light curve from jd  2,452,100 in figure 3 .",
    "one may attribute this quick decrease to a thick dust shell formation in carbon - rich ejecta .",
    "if a dust shell is quickly formed and becomes optically thick to block the stellar light , we may expect a quick decrease in the light curve . in this case",
    ", the star moves along the theoretical curve in figure 3 for a while , and then drops down earlier than the theoretical fade - away .",
    "even if a black - out by dust occurs in this system , the light curve modeling during the slow decline phase does hardly change . for",
    "a wd less massive than @xmath24 , any part of light curves can not fit the data and is also excluded . for the @xmath0 wd ( and barely the @xmath24 wd ) , it is required that a thick dust shell formation effectively occurs just near the theoretical fade - away to meet the observational data ( the upper limits , arrows in fig .",
    "3 ) . for more massive wds than @xmath0",
    ", we can shift the theoretical light curve rightward , but it is as large as by about 100 days from the limit of the decline rate , @xmath27 ( mag  days@xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore , we safely conclude that the wd of v445 pup is still as massive as @xmath0 or more .    the recurrence period of helium novae is estimated as follows : the ignition mass , i.e. , the envelope mass at the onset of helium shell flash is approximated by the mass of our wind solution at the optical peak .",
    "as the beginning time of eruption is not certain , we assume that it begins at jd  2,451,820 in figure 3 , i.e. , shortly after the latest upper limit observation at jd  2,451,814 .",
    "the schematic light curve is shown by the vertical line in figure 3 .",
    "then the ignition mass is approximated by the mass of the wind solution marked by the square , which is @xmath30 for @xmath31",
    "a model of helium - shell flashes predicts a relation between the mass accretion rate and the ignition mass . according to saio s numerical calculation of steady helium accretion ( saio 2003 , private communication )",
    ", the corresponding mass accretion rate is @xmath32  yr@xmath3 .",
    "the recurrence period of helium novae is simply estimated , from the ignition mass divided by the accretion rate , as 69 years .",
    "if we take the beginning of the outburst as the date of discovery , jd  2,451,868 , these values slightly changed to be @xmath33 , @xmath34  yr@xmath3 , and 61 years , respectively . for the case of a @xmath35 wd at jd  2,451,820 , they are @xmath36 , @xmath37  yr@xmath3 and 84 years .",
    "the distance to the star has been poorly known .",
    "we have estimated from the comparison of the absolute magnitude of theoretical light curves and the apparent magnitude of observed data to be about 640 pc for @xmath38 and 700 pc for @xmath39 with an assumed extinction a@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this value is consistent with an upper limit of 3 kpc based on the strength of an interstellar absorption given by wagner ( http://vela.as.arizona.edu/  rmw / v445pup.html ) .",
    "we have estimated the helium mass accretion rate to be several times @xmath2  yr@xmath3 .",
    "in such a high accretion rate , helium flash is very weak and only a part of the envelope blown in the wind and the rest of them accumulates on the wd @xcite .",
    "therefore , the wd will grow in mass after many cycles of helium shell flashes .",
    "the fate of the wd is either a type ia supernova or an accretion induced collapse to a neutron star , depending on its initial wd mass @xcite .",
    "the nature of the companion star is also interesting .",
    "the companion could be a helium star or a helium wd , from which the wd accretes helium matter directly . another possibility of the companion is a helium rich main - sequence star as suggested in the companion star of u sco . with such high accretion rates ,",
    "hydrogen shell flashes are very weak or the shell burning is almost stable .",
    "for example , hydrogen shell burning is steady for mass accretion rate higher than @xmath41  yr@xmath3 for @xmath42 and @xmath43  yr@xmath3 for @xmath44 for @xmath35 wd .",
    "these value depends very weakly on the wd mass .",
    "this means that for the mass accretion rate we have estimated for v445 pup , hydrogen burning is stable for @xmath42 but unstable shell flashes repeat for @xmath44 . for @xmath31",
    "wd , hydrogen burning is stable for @xmath45 but unstable for @xmath46 . in case of steady hydrogen burning",
    ", the brightness of the wd is estimated to be @xmath47 for @xmath35 wd , and 7.6 for @xmath31 wd .",
    "these values are below the upper limit of observation . before the outburst",
    ", v445 pup shows a constant brightness of @xmath48 mag .",
    "this luminosity may be a contribution from the accretion disk , not included in our theoretical light curves .    to summarize our results :",
    "we have calculated light curves of helium novae and reproduce observational data for v445 puppis . from light curve modeling",
    ", we conclude that the wd mass is more massive than @xmath49 , the envelope mass at ignition is several times @xmath1 , the mass accretion rate from the companion is several times @xmath2  yr@xmath3 , and the recurrence period of helium nova outbursts is several tens of years . distance to the star is estimated to be 640 - 700 pc with @xmath50 . because the wind is weak ,",
    "the wd is growing in mass , and therefore , v445 pup is a candidate of type ia supernova progenitors .",
    "we are grateful to vsnet members who contributed to v445 pup light curve .",
