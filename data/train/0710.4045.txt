    "the origin of parity violation can be explained within the frame work of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics through the weak interactions , but there is no clear understanding of the origin of time - reversal violation in nature .",

    "we present a study of atomic edms of closed - shell atoms which arise mainly from the tensor - pseudo tensor ( t - pt ) electron - nuclear interactions and the nuclear schiff moment ( nsm ) . at the elementary particle level ,",
    "the origin of closed - shell atomic edms is attributed to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 violating electron - quark interactions and quark - quark interactions which are predicted by the lepto - quark models , susy , etc @xcite .",
    "the limits on the t - pt coupling constant ( @xmath3 ) has been obtained from the comparison of the most recent experimental result of @xmath0 atomic edm @xcite , @xmath4 and the enhancement factor ( ratio of atomic edm to the coupling constant of the interaction in question ) calculated in @xcite .",
    "the calculation uses coupled - perturbed hartree - fock ( cphf)@xcite theory and the calculated value of the atomic edm is @xmath5 combining with experimental result , a limit on @xmath3 can be derived , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the nuclear spin .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath3 would imply physics beyond the standard model .",
    "improving the accuracy of the calculations would lead to a more stringent bound on @xmath3 .",
    "the cphf theory accounts for two - particle two - hole type of electron correlations to all orders in perturbation .",

    "the nsm(denoted by operator @xmath8 ) can originate from the nucleon - nucleon interactions or a nucleon edm . at the elementary particle level it can arise from the interaction between the quarks and the chromo edm of the quarks .",
