    "in the last decade large efforts @xcite have been devoted to the detailed understanding of the quantum dynamics of wp in simple systems like h atoms or hydrogenoid atoms .",
    "theoretical investigations resulted in very good understanding of such subtle interference effects like collapse , revivals , fractional revivals and super - revivals of wavepackets created in atomic and molecular systems .",
    "many signatures of these phenomena have been observed in numerous sophisticated experimental studies .",
    "indeed with contemporary lasers and tunable electromagnetic fields one can engineer many different desired initial states and analyze their time evolution @xcite .    our aim in this paper is to perform a new step in the analysis of the wp dynamics for hydrogen atom and for ions with one electron by considering spin motion .",
    "until now this effect was not considered for isolated atoms since it requires very long time scales to manifest itself due to the weakness of the spin  orbit coupling . in order to decrease as much as possible this time scale",
    "we will consider wp within ions with very large @xmath0 .",
    "we intended to make a calculation which include all possible effects for these elements and therefore we have considered wp which evolve under the relativistic dirac hamiltonian i.e. which are four component spinors .",
    "spin effects and relativistic effects have been studied many times but mostly for atoms submitted to intense laser fields . a recent",
    "review has been given in @xcite .",
    "some of the most relevant research works are found in @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed in them that spin and relativistic effects are small but that their magnitude increase with the intensity of the field . for fields of the order of @xmath1 to @xmath2 w/@xmath3",
    "they should be taken into account . in a most recent paper @xcite the interest",
    "has been focussed on the spin ",
    "orbit coupling , essentially for al@xmath4 and ga@xmath4 ions .",
    "the dynamics of the spin degree of freedom was analyzed there during the time of interaction of the laser with the ion .",
    "the authors did not use the dirac equation but the schrdinger equation corrected up to order @xmath5 and therefore the spin  orbit potential could be clearly identified by its mere suppression .",
    "the most significant signature occur in the radiation spectrum .",
    "however little polarization was produced for the ions which were considered .",
    "spin dynamics was previously studied by us in harmonic oscillator potentials in non - relativistic dynamics . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have found a new effect that we have called the _ spin ",
    "orbit pendulum _ for a spin  orbit potential with a constant radial part .",
    "this phenomenon is simply the periodic collapse and revival of the average spin and an exchange of angular momentum between spin and the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the analysis is quite parallel to that of the jaynes - cummings model @xcite . in order to extend this situation to a relativistic dynamics it was quite natural to study the dirac oscillator ( do ) .",
    "there , the strong entanglement that gives rise to spin oscillation is still present @xcite . because of nonlinearities of the relativistic energies the dynamics is not periodic .",
    "we have also studied relativistic effects like zitterbewegung .",
    "our studies have been also extended to wp motion corresponding to linear trajectories in non - relativistic approach ( ho+ls hamiltonian ) @xcite as well as in the relativistic dirac oscillator @xcite .",
    "our previous studies stimulated the present work for hydrogen or for heavy ions .",
    "it is expected that many features of the do should take place in this much more realistic situation .",

    "very regular revival structure connected with integer values of time in @xmath91 units is immediately recognized .",

    "orbit potential @xmath131 we have obtained there the periodic oscillations between spin and orbital angular momentum that we have called _ spin  orbit pendulum_.    in the present , more general case we see that both @xmath132 and @xmath133 contain an additional constant shift with respect to the non - relativistic expressions , coming clearly from the small components .",
    "in addition there are time dependent shifts due to the @xmath121 and @xmath122 terms .",
    "numerically these shifts may be safely neglected .",
    "therefore the most interesting dependence comes from the use of the eigenvalues of the dirac hamiltonian in the time behaviour that we will now discuss in more details .    in figs .",
    "[ sa20 ] and [ sa40 ] we present the average values of the spin operators and the length of the spin vector as functions of time for cases @xmath93 and @xmath114 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the latter case the most distinctly reminds both non - relativistic _ spin  orbit pendulum _ for the ho+ls hamiltonian @xcite and the relativistic one for the do @xcite .",
    "we clearly recognize time ranges for the spin collapse @xmath134 , strong spin entanglement @xmath135 and spin revivals ( @xmath136 , all times in @xmath91 units ) . for the case",
    "@xmath93 , shown in fig .",
    "[ sa20 ] , we see a similar behaviour of the spin averages , distorted , however , much more due to stronger interferences with @xmath112 characteristic time . in cases discussed above",
    "the ratio @xmath137 is approximately equal to 1.9 for @xmath93 and 3.7 for @xmath114 .",
    "let us now discuss the motion of wp in space .",
    "a complex structure of the autocorrelation function and the existence of several time scales suggest that qualitatively similar spatial evolution can occur in different time scales .",
    "below we focus our presentation of the probability density motion in two particular time scales : the shortest one , corresponding to the kepler period of classical electron motion on the circular orbit with @xmath80 , and the spin ",
    "orbit motion time scale .",
    "the admixture of the components @xmath138 in @xmath139 ( [ ct1 ] ) [ as shown earlier the small components give negligible contributions to @xmath140 causes deviations of the wp motion from the equatorial plane , known already from our previous non - relativistic studies @xcite . the magnitude of these deviations decreases , however , when @xmath54 increases and for @xmath141 the maximum of the probability density moves very close to the equatorial plane , i.e. the plane of the classical orbit .",
    "therefore we limit our presentation of @xmath142(t)$ ] to this plane only . for the short time scale ,",
    "@xmath143\\,t_{cl}$ ] , it is shown in fig .",
    "the sequence of pictures exhibits the behaviour known from non - relativistic studies on wp in hydrogen atom @xcite , namely circular motion with spreading along the orbit and forming interference patterns that lead to fractional revivals .",
    "[ xoy0 ] we display the full probability density @xmath144 , not the spin up and spin down components separately , because for such short time scale no difference in their motion is visible .    in order to see",
    "this difference one needs to observe wp in time scale comparable to @xmath91 . in fig .",
    "[ xoyt ] we present the sequence of shapes of the same wp ( @xmath145 ) for times @xmath146 and 2 ( in @xmath91 units ) . in these cases",
    "the presentation is divided into the two parts : in the left column spin up components of @xmath144 are displayed , whereas in the right column the spin down components are shown . at the presented time instants , that are multiples of @xmath147 both sub - packets are quite well revived ( localized ) and",
    "move on a circle with different velocities .",
    "[ xoyrev ] shows ( in the same convention ) the shapes of wp s components with spin up ( left ) and spin down ( right ) for time @xmath148 ( @xmath145 ) . as seen from fig .",
    "[ ac20 ] this time corresponds to the highest value of the autocorrelation function ( @xmath149 ) in the presented range of times .",
    "one sees from this figure that the degree of the recurrences ( of both sub - packets separately ) is indeed very high in this case .",
    "we have discussed the full 3 + 1dimensional evolution of the relativistic wave packets in coulomb potential .",
    "the main relativistic effect is the appearance of the new time scale due to the spin  orbit coupling . in general",
    "this effect has the same origin as _ spin  orbit pendulum _ , introduced by us both in non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite studies , where harmonic oscillator potential with a strong spin ",
    "orbit coupling was considered . in the coulomb potential ( relativistic ) case presented here the time scale of the spin ",
    "orbit motion is large , therefore there is practically no chance for observing it in such systems like hydrogen or hydrogenoid atoms .",
    "however , this time scale decreases rapidly as function @xmath150 , when heavy ions with the single electron are considered as systems for experimental studies . at @xmath151 , and",
    "even better @xmath94 the @xmath91 time becomes reasonably short and in principle experimental observations of the spin  orbit effects in electron wp s motion may become possible with existing techniques .",
    "this conclusion is based on the fact that the single electron heavy ions with @xmath152 have been already created and some of their properties have been measured @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to suitably adjust the two parameters @xmath153 in order to fit the energies of electron states and time scales of the motion to ranges of action of available lasers that have to be used for creation of wave packets and analysis of their motion .    comparing the phenomenon of the _ spin  orbit pendulum _ discussed in our previous studies @xcite with the present coulomb potential case one sees the following differences . during their motion coulomb",
    "wave packets experience several important time scales ( only one is present in the ho case ) that make the motion much more complex and obscure the spin ",
    "orbit motion .",
    "relativistic ( nonlinear ) dependence of the eigenenergies on quantum numbers destroy exact periodicity of the motion .",
