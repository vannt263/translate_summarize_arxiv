    "in these lectures we explore the subject of nonequilibrium dynamics . before getting into any kind of detail",
    "let us first establish what we mean by a nonequilibrium system .",
    "this is best done by taking stock of our understanding of an equilibrium system .",
    "consider the canonical ( boltzmann ) distribution for a systems with configurations labelled @xmath1 each with energy @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the task is to calculate the partition function @xmath5 from which all thermodynamic properties , in principle , can be computed .",
    "the distribution ( [ pcan ] ) applies to systems in thermal equilibrium _",
    "i.e. _ free to exchange energy with an environment at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "it can easily be generalised to systems free to exchange particles , volume etc but it always relies on the concept of the system being at equilibrium with its environment .",
    "if one were interested in dynamics , for example to simulate the model on a computer , one might choose transition rates between configurations to satisfy @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the transition rate from configuration @xmath9 to @xmath1 .",
    "condition ( [ db ] ) is known as detailed balance and guarantees ( under the assumption of ergodicity to be discussed below ) that starting from some nonequilibrium initial condition the system will eventually reach the steady state of thermal equilibrium given by ( [ pcan ] ) .",
    "we will discuss further this dynamical relaxation process and the properties of the steady state endowed by the detailed balance condition in section  [ sec : theory ] . for the moment we note",
    "that a system relaxing to thermal equilibrium is one realisation of a nonequilibrium system . in recent years",
    "such relaxation dynamics have been of special interest , for example , in the study of glassy dynamics whereby , on timescales realisable in experiment ( or simulation ) , the system never reaches the equilibrium state and it is a very slowly evolving nonequilibrium state that is observed .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as ` off - equilibrium ' dynamics .",
    "also let us mention the field of domain growth whereby an initially disordered state is quenched ( reduced to a temperature below the critical temperature for the ordered phase ) and relaxes to an ordered state through a process of coarsening of domains .",
    "the interesting physics lies in the scaling regime of the coarsening process which is observed before the equilibrium ( ordered ) state is reached .",
    "the other meaning of nonequilibrium refers to a system that reaches a steady state , but not a steady state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "examples of such nonequilibrium steady states are given by driven systems with open boundaries where a mass current is driven through the system .",
    "thus the system is driven by its environment rather being in thermal equilibrium with its environment .",
    "a pragmatic definition of a nonequilibrium system that encompasses all of the scenarios above is as a model defined by its dynamics rather than any energy function _",
    "i.e. _ the configurations of the model are sampled through a local stochastic dynamics which _ a priori _ does not have to obey detailed balance .",
    "these notes broadly follow the four lectures given at the summer school .",
    "in addition a tutorial class was held to explore points left as exercises in the lectures . in the present",
    "notes these exercises are included in a self - contained form that should allow the reader to work through them without getting stuck or else leave them for another time and continue with the main text .",
    "the notes are structured as follows : in section  2 we give an overview of two simple models that we are mainly concerned with in these lectures . in section",
    "3 we then set out the general theory of the type of stochastic model we are interested in and point out the technical difficulties in calculating dynamical or even steady - state properties .",
    "section  4 is an interlude in which we introduce , in a self - contained way , a mathematical tool  the @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator  that will prove itself of use in the final two sections . in section  5",
    "we present the solution of the partially asymmetric exclusion process and amongst other things how the phase diagram ( figure  [ fig : taseppd ] ) is generalised . in section",
    "[ sec : sbac ] we discuss the exact solution of a stochastic ballistic annihilation and coalescence model .",
    "in this work we will focus on two exemplars of nonequilibrium systems : the partially asymmetric exclusion process and a particle reaction model .",
    "these models have been well studied over the years and a large body of knowledge has been built up @xcite .",
    "we introduce the models at this point but will come back to these models in more detail in sections  [ sec : pasep ] and [ sec : sbac ] in which we summarise some recent analytical progress .",
    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a very simple driven lattice gas with a hard core exclusion interaction @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath10 particles on a one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath11 say .",
    "at each site of the lattice there is either one particle or an empty site ( to be referred to as a vacancy or hole)there is no multiple occupancy .",
    "the dynamics are defined as follows : during each time interval @xmath12 each particle has probability @xmath13 of attempting a jump to its right and probability @xmath14 of attempting a jump to its left ; a jump can only succeed if the target site is empty .    in this work will be concerned with the case @xmath15 so that we obtain continuous time dynamics with particles attempting hops to the right with rate 1 and hops to the left with rate @xmath0 . in this limit",
    "no two particles will jump at the same time .",
    "the other limit of @xmath16 would correspond to fully parallel dynamics where all particles attempt hops at the same time .",
    "this type of dynamics is employed ( for @xmath17 ) in traffic flow modelling ( see schadschneider this volume ) .    to complete the specification of the dynamics we have to fix the boundary conditions .",
    "it turns out these are of great significance .",
    "the following types of boundary conditions have been considered :    periodic : :    in this case we identify site @xmath18 with site    @xmath19 .",
    "the particles then hop around a ring and the number    of particles is conserved .",
    "open boundaries : :    in this case particles attempt to hop into site @xmath19 with    rate @xmath20 .",
    "a particle at site @xmath11 leaves    the lattice with rate @xmath21 .",
    "thus the number of    particles is not conserved at the boundaries .",
    "one can also understand    these boundary conditions in terms of a site 0 being a reservoir of    particles with fixed density @xmath20 and site    @xmath18 being a reservoir with fixed density    @xmath22",
    ". we shall primarily be concerned with these    boundary conditions because , as first pointed out by krug @xcite ,    they can induce phase transitions .",
    "the dynamics is illustrated in    figure  [ fig : pasep ] .",
    "closed boundaries : :    in this case the boundaries act as reflecting walls and particles can    not enter or leave the lattice . thus one has a zero current of    particles in the steady state and the system obeys detailed balance",
    ".    we shall not be interested in this case .",
    "infinite system : :    finally we could consider our lattice of size @xmath11 as a    finite segment of an infinite system .",
    "the macroscopic properties of the asep in which we are interested are the steady - state current ( flux of particles across the lattice ) and density profile ( average occupancy of a lattice site ) .",
    "these can be expressed in terms of the binary variables @xmath23 , where @xmath24 if site @xmath25 is occupied by a particle and @xmath26 if site @xmath25 is empty , and which together completely specify a microscopic configuration of the system .",
    "then , the density at site @xmath25 is defined as @xmath27 where the angular brackets denote an average over all histories of the stochastic dynamics .",
    "one can think of this average as being an average over an ensemble of systems all starting from the same initial configuration at time 0 .",
    "let us consider for the moment the totally asymmetric dynamics @xmath17 ( _ i.e. _  no backward particle hops are permitted ) .",
    "one can use the ` indicator ' variables @xmath23 intuitively to write down an equation for the evolution of the density .",
    "for example , if we choose a non - boundary site ( so that we can avoid prescribing any particular boundary conditions ) we obtain @xmath28 note that @xmath29 gives the probability that site @xmath30 is occupied and site @xmath25 is empty .",
    "thus , since particles hop forward with rate 1 , first term on the right hand side gives the rate at which particles enter site @xmath25 and the second term gives the rate at which they leave site @xmath25 .",
    "if one needs more convincing of the argument used to obtain ( [ ev1 ] ) consider what happens at site @xmath25 in an infinitesimal interval @xmath31 : @xmath32 \\tau_i(t ) + \\left [ 1-\\tau_i(t ) \\right ] \\tau_{i-1}(t ) & { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t \\\\[0.2ex ] \\tau_{i}(t)\\tau_{i+1}(t ) & { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\;.\\ ] ] the first equation comes from the fact that with probability @xmath33 ( dropping terms of @xmath34 ) , neither of the sites @xmath30 or @xmath25 is updated and therefore @xmath35 remains unchanged . the second and",
    "the third equations correspond to updating sites @xmath30 and @xmath25 respectively . if one averages ( [ rule ] ) over the events which may occur between @xmath36 and @xmath37 and all histories up to time @xmath36 one obtains ( [ ev1 ] ) .",
    "the same kind of reasoning allows one to write down straight away an equation for the evolution of @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 or for any other correlation function @xmath40 .",
    "these equations are exact and give in principle the time evolution of any correlation function .",
    "however , the evolution ( [ ev1 ] ) of @xmath41 requires the knowledge of @xmath42 which itself ( [ ev2 ] ) requires the knowledge of @xmath43 and @xmath44 so that the problem is intrinsically an @xmath11-body problem in the sense that the calculation of any correlation function requires the knowledge of all the others .",
    "this is a situation quite common in equilibrium statistical mechanics where , although one can write relationships between different correlation functions , there is an infinite hierarchy of equations which in general makes the problem intractable .",
    "for the case of open boundary conditions the number of particles in the system is not conserved .",
    "the evolution equations ( [ ev1]-[ev2 ] ) are then valid everywhere in the bulk but they are modified at the boundary sites . for example ( [ ev1 ] ) becomes @xmath45 @xmath46    in the steady state , where the time derivatives of correlation functions are zero , ( [ ev1],[ev3],[ev4 ] ) can be rewritten as a conserved current @xmath47 @xmath48 these equations simply express that for the density to be stationary one must have the current into any site equal to the current out of that site .",
    "for example , @xmath49 is the probability that the leftmost site is empty multiplied by the rate at which particles are inserted onto it , and hence yields the current of particles entering the system .",
    "similarly @xmath50 is the rate at which particles leave the system .      to motivate the study of this model",
    "let us consider a few applications .",
    "first we may consider the asep as a very simplistic model of traffic flow with no overtaking ( more realistic generalisations are discussed by schadschneider , this volume ) .",
    "joining many open boundary systems together into a network forms a very simple model for city traffic .",
    "such a network appears to represent faithfully real traffic phenomena such as jamming @xcite .",
    "a major motivation for the study of the asep is its connection to interface dynamics and hence to the kpz equation ( noisy burgers equation ) .",
    "the kpz equation is a stochastic non - linear partial differential equation that is central to much of modern statistical physics . in these lectures",
    "we do not have time to develop the theory of the kpz equation , rather we refer the reader to @xcite . here",
    "we just make clear the connection to a particular interface growth model .    the asymmetric exclusion model may be mapped exactly onto a model of a growing interface in @xmath51 dimensions @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig : singlestep ] .",
    "the mapping is obtained by associating to each configuration @xmath52 of the particles a configuration of an interface : a particle at a site corresponds to a downwards step of the interface height of one unit whereas a hole corresponds to an upward step of one unit .",
    "the heights of the interface are thus defined by @xmath53 the dynamics of the asymmetric exclusion process in which a particle at site @xmath30 may interchange position with a neighbouring hole at site @xmath25 , corresponds to a growth at a site @xmath25 which is a minimum of the interface height _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath54 then @xmath55 a growth event turns a minimum of the surface height into a maximum thus the asep maps onto what is known as a single - step growth model @xcite meaning that the difference in heights of two neighbouring positions on the interface is always of magnitude one unit .",
    "since whenever a particle hops forward the interface height increases by two units , the velocity @xmath56 at which the interface grows is related to @xmath47 the current in the asymmetric exclusion process by @xmath57    periodic boundary conditions for the particle problem with @xmath10 particles and @xmath58 holes correspond to an interface satisfying @xmath59 , _ i.e. _ to helical boundary conditions with an average slope @xmath60 .",
    "the case of open boundary conditions corresponds to special growth rules at the boundaries . because of this equivalence",
    ", several results obtained for the asymmetric exclusion process can be translated into exactly computable properties of the growing interface .",
    "one can also go on to list further applications @xcite . indeed early applications concerned biophysical problems such as single - filing constraint in transport across membranes @xcite and the kinetics of biopolymerisation @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss some interesting results that have been derived over the last decade for the open boundary system @xcite .",
    "for the moment we present them without proof , although we shall recover some of them in the analysis of later sections . in figure",
    "[ fig : taseppd ] we present the phase diagram ( corresponding to the limit @xmath61 ) for the totally asymmetric exclusion process _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath17 as predicted within a mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that we consider the steady state in the limit @xmath62 , thus it is implicit that we have taken the limit @xmath63 first .",
    "note there are three phases  by phase it is meant a region in the phase diagram where the current has the same analytic form ; phase boundaries divide regions where the current @xmath47 and bulk density @xmath64 ( defined as the mean occupancy of a site near the centre of the lattice as @xmath61 ) have different forms :    for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67    for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70    for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73    consider the high density phase . in this phase",
    "the exit rate is low and the bulk density is controlled by the right boundary .",
    "one can think of this as queue of traffic formed at a traffic light that does nt let many cars through at a time .",
    "the low density phase is the opposite scenario where the left boundary controls the density through a low input rate of particles .",
    "one can think of this as cars being let onto an empty road only a few at a time .",
    "finally in the maximal current phase the current of particles is saturated _",
    "i.e. _ increasing @xmath20 or @xmath21 any further does not increase the current or change the bulk density . in this phase the density of particles decays from @xmath20 its value at the left boundary to @xmath74 its value in the bulk as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the distance from the left boundary .",
    "this phase diagram of the model has many interesting features .",
    "firstly we have both continuous ( from high density or low density to maximal current ) and discontinuous ( from low density to high density ) phase transitions even though it is a one - dimensional system . in the former transitions there are discontinuities in the second derivative of the current . in the latter",
    "although the current is continuous across the phase transition its first derivative and the bulk density jump . along the transition line @xmath77 one has coexistence between a region of the high density phase adjacent to the right boundary and a region of the low density phase adjacent to the left boundary .",
    "these results are very suggestive that the current @xmath47 can be thought of as some free energy .",
    "we shall see later through an exact solution how this can be quantified",
    ". also note that throughout the maximal current phase one has long - range , power - law correlations functions _",
    "i.e. _ long - range correlations are generic .",
    "this contrasts with usual behaviour in equilibrium systems where power - law correlations are seen at non - generic , critical points ( an exception is the kosterlitz - thouless phase that may emerge at low temperature in two - dimensional equilibrium systems ) .",
    "we now have a look at reaction - diffusion systems wherein particles can react with each other to form some by - product or more simply annihilate each other . well - studied reaction systems are @xmath78 the first reaction signifies that when two @xmath79 particles meet they react and annihilate each other , the second that the two reagents coalesce . these systems model molecular reactions and the dynamics of laser induced quasiparticles known as excitons @xcite .",
    "however the particles in this type of system can also represent composite objects such as aggregating traffic jams or , as we shall see , domain walls in phase - ordering kinetics .",
    "consider first the @xmath80 reaction .",
    "clearly the steady state of such a system is the uninteresting dead state where all particles ( except perhaps one ) have been annihilated .",
    "the true interest lies in the late time regime wherein the system may enter a _ scaling _ regime . by this",
    "it is meant that the system is statistically invariant under rescaling by a typical length scale that depends on time . in this case",
    "the length scale can be taken as the typical distance between particles .    for diffusing @xmath79 particles ,",
    "known results are that for @xmath81 the typical distance between particles grows as @xmath82 or equivalently the density of a particles decreases as @xmath83 .",
    "we shall recover this result in the next section .",
    "the result differs from a naive mean - field description obtained by assuming @xmath84 which would predict @xmath85 .",
    "a similar density decay law holds for the @xmath86 process and it has been shown that the two processes are basically equivalent @xcite .",
    "in addition to having a range of applications , diffusive reaction systems have served as prototypes for the development of a variety of theoretical tools including field - theoretic techniques @xcite and the renormalisation group @xcite and exact methods in one dimension @xcite .",
    "one can also consider _ ballistic _ particle motion . in this class of models ,",
    "particles move deterministically with constant velocity and on meeting have some probability of coalescing into one particle or annihilating .",
    "a seminal paper by elskens and frisch @xcite that considered the one - dimensional deterministic case where right moving and left moving particles always annihilate on contact , showed the decay depends on the initial densities of the two species .",
    "in particular , @xmath83 only if there are equal initial densities of the right - moving and left - moving particles .",
    "ballistic models apply to chemical reactions when the inter - reactant distance is less than what would be the mean free path of particles .",
    "such models may also be applied to various domain growth problems @xcite and as we shall describe in section 6 , the smoothing of a growing interface @xcite .",
    "having now given a rough overview of some of the interest in low dimensional nonequilibrium systems , the rest of these lectures will be aimed at a given a deeper understanding of how these phenomena come about in some of the simple models we have discussed . in this section we give a brief introduction to stochastic processes focussing on particular aspects that will be relevant to the models to be studied in detail in later sections .",
    "we consider a system that can be in a finite number of microscopic configurations and whose configuration changes according to transition rates .",
    "the simplest example is of a particle performing a random walk in continuous time on a one - dimensional lattice : the particle hops to the right with rate @xmath87 and to the left with rate @xmath0 .",
    "( the meaning of a ` rate ' @xmath88 is that in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath31 an event happens with probability @xmath89 . ) since probability is conserved we can write a continuity equation for the probability which is referred to as ` the master equation ' @xmath90 the first two terms on the right hand side represent ` rates in ' from other configurations ( _ i.e. _ different positions of the particle ) ; the last term represents the rate out of the given configuration .",
    "note that the master equation is linear in the probabilities .    for the case of the random walker ,",
    "the master equation ( [ rw ] ) can be solved analytically : it is a diffusion equation in discrete space but continuous time .",
    "if we consider a periodic lattice of @xmath11 sites ( site @xmath18 is identified with site 1 ) the preferred method is to calculate the fourier modes .",
    "defining @xmath91 yields from ( [ rw ] ) @xmath92 thus @xmath93 the steady state corresponds to the mode @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath96 yield decay times @xmath97 of each mode . for @xmath98 finite and @xmath11 large @xmath99",
    "thus the equilibration time goes like @xmath100 where the dynamic exponent @xmath101 as expected of a diffusion process .",
    "random walker on the 1d lattice    review the solution of equation ( [ rw ] ) using fourier modes described above . show that if the initial condition is @xmath102 the probability distribution at time @xmath36 is given by @xmath103 where @xmath96 is given by ( [ lambdak ] )    if you are unfamiliar with the discrete fourier transform , you should first show that for @xmath104 @xmath105 and hence @xmath106 where @xmath107 is as given by equation ( [ pfourier ] ) .",
    "consider now the same random walk problem but on an infinite rather than periodic lattice .",

    "show then that the property @xmath117 immediately follows , as does the fact that @xmath118 .",
    "also , show from ( [ rw ] ) that the bessel functions satisfy the differential equation @xmath119 \\;.\\ ] ]    more generally we consider ` many - body ' problems .",
    "for example a system of many particles on a lattice obeying stochastic dynamical rules . for concreteness",
    "we consider the simple example of the one - dimensional ising model in which at each site @xmath25 there is a spin @xmath120 and periodic boundary conditions are imposed .    as mentioned in the introduction the dynamics of an equilibrium model",
    "is usually chosen to satisfy detailed balance . in the case of the ising model under spin - flip dynamics , whereby each spin can flip with a certain rate according to the directions of the neighbouring spins , the detailed balance condition on the spin - flip rates of spin @xmath121 at site @xmath25 reads @xmath122 \\label{isingdb}\\ ] ] ( we have taken @xmath123 ) . in _ glauber",

    "then , in the @xmath125 limit the spin flips for a down - spin ( @xmath126 ) at site @xmath25 occur with the rates indicated in figure  [ isingt=0 ] and similarly for up - spins at @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath128    note the final transition where the spin flips against both its neighbours is forbidden .",
    "thus domains of aligned spins can not break up .",
    "the domain walls between aligned domains _",
    "i.e. _ neighbouring pairs of spins @xmath129 or @xmath130 make random walks on the bonds of the original lattice and annihilate when they meet . as noted above ,",
    "this process of diffusing ` particles ' ( here the domain walls ) that annihilate on meeting is sometimes denoted @xmath131 .",
    "the solution for the mean domain length has been known for some time @xcite  basically it can be solved by considering the random walk performed by the length of a domain ( distance between neighbouring particles ) .    to see the solution for the mean domain size within the kinetic ising model @xcite consider the master equation which can be written @xmath132 where @xmath1 is a configuration of the ising spins and @xmath133 is the same configuration with spin @xmath121 flipped .",
    "the number of domain walls is given by @xmath134 so to study the coarsening process , in which domain walls are eliminated and aligned domains increase in size , one considers the equal time correlation function @xmath135 where the average indicates an average over initial conditions and possible histories of the stochastic dynamics .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath136 obeys a discrete diffusion equation @xmath137 with boundary condition @xmath138 .",
    "the fact that we obtain a closed set of equations for two point correlation functions is a very happy property that allows one to solve easily for these correlation functions  basically ( [ ceq ] ) is an equation of the same form as ( [ rw ] ) but with a boundary condition corresponding to a source of walkers at site 0 : see @xcite for details .",
    "note that the method generalises to finite temperature but not to higher dimensions .",
    "actually higher point correlation functions are more difficult to calculate ; nevertheless it has been shown that the one - dimensional glauber model can be turned into a free fermion problem which then implies , in principle at least , that any correlation function can be calculated @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the full domain size probability distribution has been explicitly calculated for the one - dimensional @xmath0-state potts model , which includes the ising model as the case @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "( note that a calculation such as exercise 2 only calculates the first moment of the domain sizes ) .",
    "the dynamics of domain walls in the @xmath0-state potts model , represented as @xmath79 particles , corresponds to diffusion and , on meeting , reaction according to @xmath140{ll }      a \\quad \\mbox { with probability}\\quad ( q-2)/(q-1)\\\\      \\emptyset \\quad \\mbox{with probability}\\quad 1/(q-1 )       \\end{array }   \\right.\\ ] ] to understand this equation note that when a domain is elimated each of the neighbouring domains may be in one of @xmath141 states so that they have probability @xmath142 of being in the same state and therefore coalescing .",

    ". however it should be recalled that in quantum mechanics it is the modulus squared of the components @xmath176 that are probabilities whereas here the components of @xmath176 are probabilities .",
    "see @xcite , for example , for more details .",
    "the formal solution of the master equation ( [ meq ] ) is @xmath181 where @xmath182 gives the initial conditions .",
    "however , a more useful way of dealing with the problem is to consider the eigenvectors of the transition matrix @xmath10 .",
    "the first thing to note is that since @xmath10 is not hermitian , in general , it has different left and right eigenvectors @xmath183 these satisfy ` bi - orthogonality ' @xmath184 and in principle ( assuming @xmath10 can be diagonalised ) we may write @xmath185 then we have using ( [ formal ] ) , ( [ complete ] ) and ( [ rev ] ) @xmath186    note that the real parts of all eigenvalues @xmath187 are negative except for one eigenvalue which is zero . the reason for this",
    "is often referred to as the perron - frobenius theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem holds for a matrix with non - negative entries where a sufficiently large power of the matrix has all positive entries .",
    "it states that the maximum eigenvalue is non - degenerate and the corresponding left and right eigenvectors have positive entries .",
    "in our context one can relate the spectrum of @xmath10 to that of non - negative matrix @xmath188 obtained by adding some suitable multiple ( say minus the diagonal element with the largest magnitude ) of the identity matrix to @xmath10 .",
    "the assumption that a sufficiently large power of @xmath188 has all positive entries is equivalent to the assumption that the ( finite ) system is ergodic _",
    "i.e. _ any configuration can be reached from any other after sufficient time . in that case",
    "the system will have a unique steady state so that the zero eigenvalue can not be degenerate and the steady state eigenvector has positive elements which correspond to probabilities .    in principle , all probabilities at all times can be found if one can diagonalise the matrix @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately this is only possible in a few isolated cases .",
    "generally this corresponds to many - particle systems where the particles do not interact or certain ` integrable ' systems that can be solved via the bethe ansatz .",
    "the bethe ansatz was originally used in the context of a spin - chain model for magnetism @xcite and is suitable for a one - dimensional lattice system in which the number of particles is conserved .",
    "it is basically a generalisation of the fourier transform .",
    "let us briefly discuss it for the case of the asep .",
    "the idea is to guess the following form for eigenvectors @xmath189 @xmath190 in which @xmath191 is the position of particle @xmath25 on a lattice , and @xmath192 with @xmath11 the lattice size once again .",
    "the sum is over all permutations @xmath193 of @xmath194 and @xmath195 is some amplitude .",
    "one uses the master equation to determine relations that must be satisfied by @xmath196 in its unphysical regions , _",
    "e.g. _  where two particles occupy the same site and @xmath197 for some @xmath25 .",
    "after some manipulation , one arrives at a set of nonlinear equations that must be simultaneously satisfied by all the ` momenta ' @xmath198 .",
    "an early account of this method in the context of stochastic processes is given in @xcite .",
    "the technique is also described in @xcite .",
    "however even for the so - called ` integrable ' systems where the bethe ansatz works it is actually very difficult to extract the explicit eigenvectors .    of course , it may not be possible to solve a model exactly , and in this situation one often turns to approximation schemes .",
    "for example , one can try a ` short time ' expansion  we simply truncate the power series defining the exponential of @xmath10 in ( [ formal ] ) after @xmath199 terms @xmath200 the finite number of terms @xmath199 on the right hand side can be calculated . from the series one can try to estimate , for example , the dynamical exponent @xcite .",
    "a project less ambitious than solving the full dynamics is to calculate the steady state probabilities ( the eigenvector with eigenvalue 0 ) .",
    "we denote the steady state by dropping the subscript @xmath36 so that @xmath201 is the eigenvector with eigenvalue zero @xmath202 and its components @xmath203 are the steady state probabilities .",
    "thus one has the balance conditions @xmath204    let us review some simple ways to satisfy ( [ sscon ] ) .",
    "first of all one has the case of detailed balance where @xmath205 however to check this condition _",
    "i.e. _  to check whether detailed balance is satisfied we first need to know the steady state",
    "! however there is an equivalent set of conditions called ` kolmogorov criteria ' which state that detailed balance is obeyed if and only if the transition rates satisfy @xmath206 for _ every _ possible cycle in configuration space @xmath207 .    that ( [ meqn : db1 ] ) implies ( [ meqn : db2 ] ) is very simple to show . to show that the converse is also true",
    "is most simply achieved @xcite by using ( [ meqn : db1 ] ) to determine @xmath203 .",
    "then , one finds that @xmath203 is unique if and only if ( [ meqn : db2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "let us consider some of the implications of the detailed balance condition .",
    "first note that when one has detailed balance then in the steady state there is no net flow of probability between any two configurations .",
    "since there is no flow of probability there is nothing to distinguish the forwards direction in time from backwards direction .",
    "therefore running the systems backwards in time will not change , for example , any two time correlation functions .",
    "thus the system is said to be _",
    "reversible_.    now consider the simple problem of a single random walker on a periodic one - dimensional lattice , studied at the beginning of this section .",
    "the steady state is given by equal probability of the walker occupying each site .",
    "however , one does not have detailed balance as defined above unless the hop rates are symmetric @xmath208 .",
    "but one knows that the only effect of @xmath209 is to impose a drift . clearly with a drift",
    "the system is not reversible .",
    "but the system is reversible under simultaneous reversal of time and parity ( _ i.e. _ direction ) : the parity operation results in defining the image of position @xmath76 as @xmath210 .",
    "then trivially @xmath211 since in the steady state @xmath212 is constant in space and both transition rates are equal to @xmath87 .",
    "more generally an _ extended _ detailed balance condition can pertain as defined in @xcite : @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the image configuration of @xmath1 under a reversible mapping .",
    "one requires @xmath215 and @xmath216 again one can construct an equivalent condition as follows @xcite @xmath217 for _ every _ possible cycle in configuration space @xmath218 along with the additional condition ( [ addcon ] ) .",
    "the condition ( [ edb ] ) is known in the probabilistic literature as _ dynamic reversibility _ @xcite .",
    "more recently it has appeared in the physics literature under the name _ pairwise balance _ @xcite .",
    "it holds for example in the asep on a ring where the image configuration is obtained by the parity operation .      in this subsection",
    "our aim is to derive the general solution for the steady state ( [ meqn : solveme ] ) for an arbitrary transition rate matrix @xmath10 .",
    "although the solution is too general to be of any practical use it is instructive to see how a quantity analogous to a partition function naturally arises .",
    "as it stands , the set of linear equations ( [ meqn : solveme ] ) is underdetermined because the determinant of @xmath10 is zero ( one of its eigenvalues is zero ) . however , we know that a probability distribution must be properly normalised , so consider instead the equation @xmath219 in which @xmath220 is the matrix obtained from @xmath180 ( the minus sign is introduced for convenience below ) by replacing the @xmath221 row with all ones , _",

    "we choose @xmath228 , and to be clear we write out @xmath229 explicitly .",

    "that is @xmath234 so that @xmath235 we thus identify the cofactor @xmath236 with the _ steady - state weight _ of configuration @xmath224 and @xmath237 as a _ normalisation _ for the stochastic process . in an equilibrium system",
    ", @xmath237 is related to the partition function @xmath238 .",
    "however , the normalisation @xmath237 obtained using the above procedure is not guaranteed to be identical to @xmath239 due to the possibility of common factors present in all the weights @xmath236 and hence @xmath237 . with this understood , ( [ zneq ] )",
    "extends the notion of a partition function to nonequilibrium systems .",
    "we now note an interesting and , as far as we are aware , little - known result that relates the normalisation @xmath237 ( [ zneq ] ) to the eigenvalues of the transition matrix .",
    "the relation reads @xmath240 in which the product is over the eigenvalues of the transition rate @xmath10 except the zero eigenvalue .",
    "this result is obtained by expanding the characteristic polynomial @xmath241 in powers of @xmath187 .",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath242 with @xmath236 as defined above . given that @xmath243 and @xmath244 we find that @xmath245 where the last step follows because one , and only one , eigenvalue of @xmath10 is zero ( at least if the process is ergodic ) .",
    "we now consider the existence of _ phase transitions _ in a stochastic process . as in equilibrium systems",
    ", we identify phase transitions through discontinuities in macroscopic quantities or their derivatives . furthermore , at a first - order ( discontinuous ) transition we expect phase coexistence and at a continuous transition divergences in length and time scales .    in terms of eigenvalues of the transition matrix @xmath10",
    ", a phase transition would be indicated by the clustering of one or more eigenvalues towards zero .",
    "for example as a discontinuous transition is approached one would expect long - lived ` excited ' states since the decay time of an eigenstate of @xmath10 is inversely proportional to the real part of the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "these long - lived states can be thought of as metastable states and the approach of an eigenvalue to zero in the thermodynamic ( infinite system - size ) limit suggests phase coexistence . near a continuous transition one",
    "has diverging time scales ( as manifested by _ e.g. _  a power - law decay of an autocorrelation function ) so one expects a continuous spectrum of eigenvalues whose real parts are close to zero .    bearing this in mind , we note that equation ( [ meqn : zevals ] ) implies that the steady - state normalisation @xmath237 also approaches zero at a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "such a scenario is analogous to yang - lee theory of equilibrium phase transitions , in which it has been rigorously shown that zeros of the grand canonical partition function in the complex - fugacity plane converge towards a point on the positive real axis that indicates the value of the fugacity at which a phase transition occurs .",
    "similar properties are also displayed by the zeros of the canonical partition function in the complex - temperature plane ( these are also known as fisher zeros ) .",
    "hence , it would seem likely from ( [ meqn : zevals ] ) and the above considerations that zeros of a steady - state nonequilibrium normalisation in the complex plane of some control parameter would also converge to the real axis at a nonequilibrium phase transition .",
    "this would also imply nonanalyticities in a macroscopic variable averaged with respect to the steady - state probability distribution function .",
    "this idea has been pursued in the context of an asymmetric exclusion process @xcite . in this case , the steady - state normalisation was solved for its zeros in the complex - fugacity plane and indeed they were found to approach the real axis for values of the model parameters that corresponded to a phase transition .",
    "additionally , a similar approach has been tried in the context of directed percolation @xcite , a further lattice model that exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "this concludes our overview of stochastic processes .",
    "we will shortly move on to the specific models we are going to study . as mentioned in the introduction",
    "the ` @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator ' plays a central role in the solution of both these models .",
    "first let us recall the quantum harmonic oscillator well known from undergraduate physics .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath246 where we have lazily set all constants @xmath247 etc to unity and where @xmath248 denotes an operator .",
    "one way to treat the problem is to introduce two new operators @xmath249 through @xmath250 then inserting these definitions into the commutation relation @xmath251 = i{\\mbox{$1\\!\\!1$}}$ ] yields @xmath252 also the hamiltonian ( [ ho ] ) becomes @xmath253 the operators @xmath249 are , of course , raising and lowering operators .",
    "more generally they are bosonic operators , the defining property of which is the commutation relation ( [ boson ] ) . in the number ( or energy )",
    "basis they obey @xmath254 thus in this basis @xmath255 and the hamiltonian is diagonal .",
    "the number @xmath256 labels the energy eigenstates .",
    "the quantised energy excitations obey bose statistics and the operators ( [ energybasis ] ) create and annihilate bosons respectively .",
    "the hermite polynomials come into play when we consider the projection of an energy eigenstate onto the position eigenbasis defined by @xmath257 then @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the hermite polynomial of degree @xmath256 .",
    "we now consider a ` deformation ' of ( [ boson ] ) by introducing a parameter @xmath0 @xcite @xmath260 observe that taking @xmath261 recovers bosonic operators whereas @xmath262 gives fermionic operators .",
    "thus it was originally hoped that the @xmath0-deformed operators might describe some new excitations interpolating between fermions and bosons .",
    "the operators @xmath263 and @xmath264 now operate on basis vectors @xmath265 ( with @xmath266 ) as follows : @xmath267 thus @xmath268 , which is the analogue of the energy operator , is diagonal in this basis @xmath269 the eigenstates of the ` position operator ' @xmath270 are given by @xmath271 finally , we identify the @xmath0-hermite polynomials as @xmath272      using ( [ adqaction],[aqaction ] ) and ( [ qherm ] ) it is straightforward to derive a recurrence relation @xmath273 this can be compared to the usual recurrence relation for hermite polynomials @xmath274 to make the connection between @xmath0-hermite and ordinary hermite polynomials we would like the recurrence relations to coincide in the limit @xmath275 .",
    "the prescription is @xmath276 in which both the hermite polynomial @xmath277 and the independent variable @xmath76 are transformed .",
    "the factors of @xmath278 that appear can be traced back to the fact that we set @xmath279 when doing the quantum mechanics , but we take @xmath270 in the @xmath0-deformed case .    explicit formul  for @xmath280 can be found using a generating function technique , the details of which differ slightly depending on whether @xmath281 or @xmath282 . here",
    "we discuss in detail the case @xmath281 .",
    "first we define a generating function @xmath283 for the @xmath0-hermite polynomials @xmath284 where have introduced a ` @xmath0-factorial ' notation defined through @xmath285 we later encounter products of these factorials for which we use a standard shorthand @xcite : @xmath286 the @xmath0-factorial in ( [ eqn : gdef ] ) is introduced for convenience as will now become apparent .",

    "firstly the features of the phase diagram for @xmath281 ( figure 5 ) appear robust for stochastic one - dimensional driven systems and can be predicted from considerations of domain wall dynamics @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed through the exact solution of the open boundary system with fully parallel dynamics @xcite .",
    "however when the bulk dynamics become deterministic the maximal current phase is lost .    for the case of symmetric exclusion @xmath261 ( no bulk drive ) one does not have phase transitions ; the current is easy to calculate and decays linearly with system size @xcite .",
    "intuitively one can understand this as diffusion between two particle reservoirs of different density",
    ". the diffusion current will be proportional to the concentration gradient which decreases as @xmath425 .",
    "thus although the bulk dynamics is symmetric the boundary conditions force a weak current of particle through the system .    for @xmath261 a recent work",

    "nonlocal_. for the particular boundary conditions where the dynamics satisfy detailed balance , @xmath428 $ ] reduces to the free energy functional known from equilibrium statistical physics and so the nonlocal functional would seem to generalise a well - known equilibrium concept .",
    "an interesting kind of boundary - induced phase transition , manifesting spontaneous symmetry breaking , is found when the asymmetric exclusion process is generalised to two oppositely moving species of particle : one species is injected at the left , moves rightwards and exits at the right ; the other species is injected at the right , moves leftwards and exits at the left @xcite .",
    "intuitively one can picture the system as a narrow road bridge : cars moving in opposite directions can pass each other but can not occupy the same space .",
    "the model has a left - right symmetry when the injection rates and exit rates for the two species of particles are symmetric .",
    "however for low exit rates ( @xmath21 ) this symmetry is broken and the lattice is dominated by one of the species at any given time .",
    "this implies that the short time averages of currents and bulk densities of the two species of particles are no longer equal . over longer times",
    "the system flips between the two symmetry - related states . in the @xmath429",
    "limit the mean flip time between the two states has been calculated analytically and shown to diverge exponentially with system size @xcite .",
    "thus the ` bridge ' model provided a first example of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a one dimensional system .    in the models discussed so far the open boundaries",
    "can be thought of as inhomogeneities where the order parameter ( particle density ) is not conserved .",
    "inhomogeneities which conserve the order parameter can be considered on a periodic system .",
    "indeed a single defect bond on the lattice ( through which particles hop more slowly ) is sufficient to cause the system to separate into two macroscopic regions of different densities @xcite : a high density region which can be thought of as a traffic jam behind the defect and a low density region in front of the defect . here",
    "the presence of the drive appears necessary for the defect to induce the phase separation .",
    "moving defects ( _ i.e. _ particles with dynamics different from that of the others ) have also been considered and exact solutions obtained @xcite . for the simple case of a slowly moving particle the phenomenon of a queue of particles forming behind it has been shown to be analogous to bose condensation @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : sbacintro ] we introduced two reaction systems , namely annihilation ( @xmath430 ) and coalescence ( @xmath431 ) .",
    "as noted in section  [ sec : sbacintro ] , it is well known that annihilation and coalescence reactions are equivalent when the reactant motion is diffusive @xcite and hence lead to the same @xmath432 density decay in one dimension .",
    "we now consider in detail the distinct case of ballistic reactant motion by which it is meant that particles move with some fixed velocity .",
    "we study a class of models that comprise an arbitrary combination of annihilation and coalescence of particles with two ( conserved ) velocities and stochastic reaction dynamics and which was solved in @xcite . as we shall see , an exact solution is possible by virtue of a matrix product method in which the matrices involved can be written in terms of the raising and lowering operators of the @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator .",
    "a related , but distinct , ballistic reaction model ( not contained within the class discussed here ) had also revealed a connection between ballistic reaction systems and @xmath0-deformed operator algebras @xcite .",
    "we now define the class of models to be considered . at time",
    "@xmath433 reactants are placed randomly on a line .",
    "each particle is assigned a velocity @xmath434 ( right - moving ) or @xmath435 ( left - moving ) with probability @xmath436 and @xmath437 respectively .",
    "particles move ballistically until two collide , at which point one of four outcomes follows , see figure  [ fig : outcomes ] : the particles pass through each other with probability @xmath0 ; the particles coalesce into a left ( right ) moving particle with probability @xmath438 ( @xmath439 ) ; the particles annihilate with probability @xmath440 . here",
    "@xmath441 is the probability that some reaction occurs .",
    "as an example of an application of this model consider the identification of right- and left - moving particles with the edges of terraces as illustrated in figure  [ fig : rsos ] .",
    "if new particles are added to the system in such a way that they only stick to the sides , and the rate of particle addition is taken to infinity , one obtains ballistic motion of terrace edges .",
    "when two edges meet , a terrace is completed which corresponds to annihilation of approaching particles .",
    "hence the relevant parameters of the general annihilation coalescence model are @xmath442 . the scattering reaction , which occurs with rate @xmath0 , corresponds to the possibility of a new terrace being formed when two edges meet .",
    "the case of deterministic annihilation @xmath443 was studied by elskens and frisch @xcite . here",
    "particles always annihilate on contact .",
    "this case was found to exhibit a density decay that depends on time as @xmath432 , but only if the initial densities of the two particle species ( left- and right - moving ) are the same . in the following analysis of the more general class of reaction systems",
    ", we find that such a result persists if two ` effective ' initial densities ( to be defined below ) are equal .",
    "furthermore , we will see that the introduction of stochasticity into the reaction dynamics _",
    "i.e. _ the parameter @xmath0 , induces a transition in the density decay form .",
    "our aim is to calculate the density decay .",
    "to do this we shall consider without loss of generality a right moving test particle as illustrated in figure  [ fig : traj ] .",
    "we define @xmath444 as the probability that the test particle survives up to a time @xmath36 respectively . from figure",
    "[ fig : traj ] one can see that the initial spacing of the particles on the line does not affect the _ sequence _ of possible reactions for any given particle , in particular for the test particle ( we return to this point later ) .",
    "also note that after a given time @xmath36 , the test particle may only have interacted with the @xmath11 particles initially placed within a distance @xmath445 ( and to the right ) of the chosen particle .",
    "these two facts imply that the survival probability can be expressed in terms of two independent functions .",
    "the first is @xmath446 , the probability that initially there were exactly @xmath11 particles in a region of size @xmath445 .",
    "the second is @xmath447 , the probability that the test particle survives reactions with the @xmath11 particles initially to its right , and depends only on the sequence of the @xmath11 particles .",
    "explicitly , @xmath448    thus the problem is reduced to two separate combinatorial problems of calculating @xmath446 and @xmath447 .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath446 allows one to consider a model defined on a lattice or on the real line . in the present work we assume particles",
    "are initially placed on a line with nearest - neighbour distances chosen independently from an exponential distribution with unit mean .",
    "then we can use a well - known result @xcite @xmath449 we now show that the second problem ( calculation of @xmath447 ) can be formulated within a matrix product approach .    as",
    "an example consider a test particle encountering the string of reactants depicted in figure  [ fig : traj ] .",
    "we claim that the probability of the test particle surviving through this string may be written as @xmath450 where @xmath451 are matrices and @xmath452 , @xmath453 vectors with scalar product @xmath454 .",
    "thus we write , in order , a matrix @xmath455 ( @xmath456 ) for each right ( left ) moving particle in the initial string .",
    "the conditions for an expression such as ( [ eqn : fex ] ) to hold for an arbitrary string are , in fact , rather intuitive @xmath457 ) \\\\ \\label{eqn : wdef } \\langle w| l & = &   \\langle w| ( q+p\\eta_r ) \\\\",
    "r |v\\rangle & = & |v\\rangle\\;. \\label{eqn : vdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the condition ( [ eqn : rl ] ) just echoes the reactions that occur in figure  [ fig : outcomes ] _ i.e. _ after an interaction between a right - moving and left - moving particle there are four possible outcomes ( see figure  [ fig : outcomes ] ) corresponding to the four terms on the right hand side of ( [ eqn : rl ] ) with probabilities given by the respective coefficients . using ( [ eqn : rl ] ) , any initial matrix product such as ( [ eqn : fex ] ) can be reduced to a sum of terms of the form @xmath458 corresponding to all possible final states ensuing from the initial string and with coefficients equal to the probabilities of each final state .",
    "these final states give the possible sequences of particles that the right - moving test particle will encounter .",
    "the test particle will survive such a final state and pass through the @xmath459 left - moving particles with probability @xmath460 . the condition ( [ eqn : vdef ] )",
    "ensures that this probability is obtained for each possible final state _",
    "i.e._@xmath461 finally the condition ( [ eqn : wdef ] ) , along with @xmath462 , ensures that once a right - moving particle passes through all the left - moving particles in the string it no longer plays a role .",
    "thus ( [ left ] ) becomes @xmath463    note that the reason for a matrix product formulation is different from the pasep .",
    "there the steady state probability of any configuration , for arbitrary system size , could be written as a matrix product . here",
    "the probability of a particle surviving some arbitrary sequence of particles can be written as a matrix product .",
    "the above approach relies on an important property of the system which is invariance of a reaction sequence with respect to changes of initial particle spacings . to understand this , consider again figure  [ fig : traj ] . by altering the initial spacings of the particles , the absolute times at which trajectories intersect and reactions may occur ( if the reactants have survived ) may be altered .",
    "for example , by increasing the spacing between the fifth and sixth particles , the trajectories of the third and fourth particles can be made to intersect first .",
    "however as we have already seen , for any particle , the _ order _ of intersections it encounters does not change and so the final states and probabilities are invariant .",
    "this invariance is manifested in the matrix product by the fact that the order in which we use the reduction rule ( [ eqn : rl ] ) is unimportant _",
    "i.e. _  matrix multiplication is associative .",
    "thus , it is the invariance with respect to initial spacings that allows the system to be solved by using a product of matrices .",
    "we now proceed to evaluate @xmath447 . averaging ( [ eqn : fex ] ) over all initial strings of length @xmath11 , recalling that @xmath436 and @xmath464 are the probabilities that a particle is assigned velocity @xmath465 respectively , yields @xmath466 to evaluate @xmath447 we first write @xmath467 in these equations",
    "we have introduced two new parameters @xmath468 which we call effective initial particle densities and whose ratio @xmath469 turns out to be an important parameter of the model",
    ".    one can verify from ( [ eqn : rl][eqn : vdef ] ) that @xmath470 satisfy a @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator algebra @xmath471 thus ( [ eqn : f ] ) can be written as @xmath472^n | v \\rangle\\;. \\label{eqn : fmat}\\ ] ] the vectors @xmath337 and @xmath338 are eigenvectors of @xmath473 , and as in section  [ sec : pasep ] , they can be explicitly calculated .    at this point",
    "one can see that we have precisely the same mathematical structure as we did when solving for the steady state of the pasep  compare ( [ eqn : ho][eqn : coherent ] ) with ( [ pasepqho1][pasepqho3 ] ) . we just need to carry out the same procedure of diagonalising a matrix that is linear combination of the identity operator and the position operator of a @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator . rather than repeat the details here we go directly to a discussion of the phase diagram .",
    "deterministic ballistic annihilation and random walks    the elskens - frisch model @xcite of deterministic ballistic annihilation is a special case of the stochastic model described above that has the parameters @xmath474 . for the case",
    "where particles are initially placed on all sites of a lattice with equal probability of right- and left - moving particles , write down all possible initial conditions that would allow a right - moving test particle to survive through one , two and three sites .",
    "hence relate the survival probability of the test particle after @xmath11 sites to the probability of a random walker not returning to the origin after @xmath18 steps .",
    "hint : devise a criterion for the survival of the test particle that involves the relative number of left- and right - moving particles for a given initial condition .",

    "thus there is universality of ballistic annihilation and coalescence : for a generic choice of @xmath494 , @xmath495 defining a particular annihilation - coalescence model , the same four decay regimes are found by varying the initial densities or stochasticity parameter @xmath0 . in this way the universality can be considered as a ` law of corresponding states ' .",
    "the line @xmath496 ( equal effective densities ) is non - generic since a single , power law , decay regime is found .",
    "the decay does not depend on the stochasticity @xmath0 .",
    "this special line was found by elskens and frisch @xcite for the case of deterministic annihilation ( @xmath497 ) and we have shown that this special line is present for all combinations of annihilation and coalescence .",
    "this phase can be understood through the picture of @xcite .",
    "density fluctuations in the initial conditions lead to trains of left- and right - moving particles : in a length @xmath498 the excess particle number is @xmath499 which yields the @xmath432 density decay . at long times ,",
    "the train size is large and so a particle in one train encounters many particles in the other and will eventually react making the parameter @xmath0 irrelevant .",
    "the second phase found in @xcite ( labelled the elskens - frisch phase in the diagram ) is seen to persist for nonzero @xmath0 and in this phase the two particle species decay at equal rates .",
    "the two new phases that arise in the full model for @xmath500 ( _ i.e. _  as a consequence of randomness in the reaction dynamics ) have the contrasting property that two particle species decay at _ unequal _ rates leaving a non - zero population of left - moving particles .",
