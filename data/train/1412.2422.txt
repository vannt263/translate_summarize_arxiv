    "the large area telescope ( lat ) on board nasa s _ fermi _ satellite has detected over 150 new gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "one seemingly unifying feature seen in all of these pulsars is the form of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which is typically described by a power law followed by a spectral cutoff occurring between 1 and 10  gev @xcite .",
    "the relatively narrow range of the measured cutoff energy observed in pulsars across a wide range of spin parameters suggests the gamma - ray emission mechanism is common across these pulsars and that it is not strongly dependent on the pulsar spin or energetics . above the gev break energy ,",
    "pulsar seds appear to fall exponentially , although for bright gamma - ray pulsars with high statistics above the break , sub - exponential cutoffs are preferred @xcite .",
    "curvature radiation occurring at the radiation - reaction limit in the outer magnetosphere can largely explain these spectral features and thus , models based on this mechanism have become the most favored explanations of pulsar emission in the _ fermi_-lat era .    from a modeling perspective , the maximum energy of the observed radiation provides robust and model - independent constraints on the altitude of the emission sites above the neutron star @xcite .",
    "the shape of the sed above the break is also a key probe of the emission mechanisms , with exponential cutoffs predicted in curvature emission models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and power - law extensions predicted in inverse - compton scattering models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while curvature emission is broadly accepted as the dominant emission mechanism , many authors , such as @xcite and @xcite have discussed the role of inverse - compton emission processes in pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "the discovery of @xmath1100  gev emission from the crab pulsar @xcite , which strongly disfavors curvature - emission - based models , has led to renewed interest in inverse - compton studies and @xcite and @xcite , and others , have presented magnetospheric inverse - compton models which explain emission above the gev break measured by _ fermi_-lat .",
    "others , such as @xcite and @xcite have presented inverse - compton models where pulsed emission at sub - tev energies originates from acceleration zones outside the light cylinder .    the crab pulsar is the only pulsar known which clearly exhibits non - exponentially - suppressed emission above the gev break , with power - law - type emission seen to extend to 400  gev .",
    "studies of the geminga pulsar show that the sed above the gev break is compatible with a steep power law @xcite , but no emission has been seen above 100  gev .",
    "recent studies of the vela pulsar with _",
    "fermi_-lat data have reported significant emission above 50 gev @xcite , but again , no significant emission above 100  gev has been observed .",
    "@xcite argues that even in the case of these two bright pulsars - the brightest known to exist - the available spectral data are not sufficient to discriminate between exponential and power - law -shaped spectra above @xmath010  gev .",
    "fermi_-lat catalog of sources above 10  gev ( 1fhl ) reports the detection of significant pulsations from thirteen pulsars at energies which exceed 25  gev @xcite .",
    "these thirteen pulsars are largely drawn from the brightest pulsars observed by the _ fermi_-lat ( f@xmath2s@xmath3@xmath4 ) and thus are sufficiently bright to be detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat at these energies even as their spectrum falls rapidly above the break . in the second _ fermi_-lat catalog of gamma - ray pulsars ,",
    "only four pulsars have a measured flux point above 30  gev @xcite and the statistical uncertainties on the spectral points are too large provide robust tests of model predictions at these energies .",
    "the question of whether the crab pulsar is unique , or whether non - exponentially - suppressed gamma - ray spectra are common in gamma - ray pulsars is of great importance . beyond pulsar emission modeling",
    ", questions concerning the emission properties of pulsars have significant implications for galactic dark matter searches , where unassociated gamma - ray excesses can be interpreted as the remnants of dark matter annihilation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since pulsars are likely the main background for these searches , categorizing the shape of pulsar spectra is a critical step towards validating any indirect dark matter signal in the gamma - ray domain . to address these questions , we present a stacked analysis of gamma - ray pulsars to search for non - exponentially - suppressed emission above 50  gev which can not be resolved in the _ fermi_-lat analysis of a single object , but",
    "can be detected from an ensemble .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured in the following way . in section 2",
    "we describe the _",
    "fermi_-lat data used in this analysis .",
    "section 3 introduces the _ aperture photometry _ method for measuring pulsar spectra and presents an assessment of its performance . in section 4",
    "we present the results of the stacking analysis and in section 5 we provide some discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "this work is based on the 117 pulsars described in the second _ fermi_-lat catalog of gamma - ray pulsars @xcite , which shall be referred to as 2pc throughout .",
    "2pc provides a wealth of measured spectral and temporal characteristics which enable this study .",
    "of particular importance to this analysis is the _ off _ peak phase range , which is derived from a bayesian block analysis of the pulsar light curve @xcite .",
    "this is the interval of the pulsar rotation phase where the pulsed emission is deemed to be at its lowest flux .",
    "range was defined in the 2pc for psrj2215 + 5135 , thus this pulsar was excluded from the study .",
    "further , while used as the prototype for the analysis methodology , the crab pulsar was also excluded from this study , since we are investigating whether crab - pulsar - like emission above @xmath050  gev is seen in other pulsars . the exclusion of these two sources reduces the number of pulsars analyzed in this work to 115  76 young ( non - recycled ) pulsars and 39 millisecond pulsars .    beyond the number of pulsars analyzed ,",
    "the size of the data set used for a given pulsar analysis is entirely dependent on the availability of pulsar timing solutions .",
    "timing solutions encode the spin - down behavior of the pulsar and enable the conversion of the measured photon arrival time to the pulsar rotation phase value .",
    "pulsar timing solutions with periods of validity ranging from 1.4  yr to 3.3  yr were provided in the supplementary material of the 2pc . for 66 pulsars ,",
    "updated timing solutions provided by matthew kerr @xcite which have periods of validity lasting @xmath05  yr were chosen over the shorter 2pc timing solutions . combining the two cases , the average data set analyzed spans 4.2  yr ( see figure  [ fig : years ] ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that longer timing solutions were more often provided for brighter pulsars .    the _ fermi_-lat pulsar analysis presented here",
    "uses pass-7 reprocessed ` source`-class photon data retrieved from the _ fermi _ science support center weekly data server .",
    "data processing was performed using the _ fermi _ science tools version ` v9r33p0-fssc-20140520 ` .",
    "spectral analysis of _",
    "fermi_-lat data is typically performed through a maximum likelihood fitting procedure where the photon event data are fit to a positional and spectral model .",
    "the flux for a particular source is then derived from the best fit model .",
    "fermi_-lat data can also be analyzed with an _ aperture photometry _ ( ap ) method where the raw event counts from a particular region of interest on the sky are combined with a measure of the instrument exposure ( @xmath5s ) to the region to determine the flux .",
    "the on - line _ fermi_-lat analysis manual reports that the ap method is less accurate and less sensitive than the likelihood fitting procedure but that it `` provides a model independent measure of the flux '' and it `` is less computationally demanding '' . we demonstrate here that the ap method can be used to produce accurate seds for pulsars from multi - year data sets .",
    "this type of analysis is possible due to the accurate determination of the background rate which can be measured in the _ off _ phase range .",
    "the processing follows closely the ap analysis thread detailed in the on - line _ fermi_-lat analysis manual .    1",
    ".   logarithmically - spaced energy binning with 4 bins per decade is chosen over the 100  mev to 1  tev energy range .",
    "a region of interest ( roi ) is chosen around each pulsar with an energy - dependent radius .",
    "the radius chosen is three times the 68% point - spread - function ( psf ) containment radius determined from a vela analysis by @xcite which range from 2.26@xmath6 at 100  mev to 0.15@xmath6 at 10  gev . in order to maintain sufficient statistics at high energies ,",
    "the radius of the roi was fixed to 3@xmath70.15@xmath6 above 10  gev .",
    "3 .   the _ fermi_-lat analysis tools ` gtselect ` , ` gtmktime ` , ` gtbin ` and ` gtexposure ` are then run over each pulsar with the corresponding radial and energy selections for all observations performed within the period of validity of the pulsar timing solution .",
    "the photon event list is then barycentered and phase - folded using the ` tempo2 ` package @xcite with the _ fermi _ `",
    "tempo2 ` plugin and the corresponding timing solution . 5 .   for the 66 pulsars where timing solutions other than those provided by the 2pc were used",
    ", a cross - correlation analysis was performed on the phase data to determine the phase offset between the derived pulsar light curve and the light curve published in the 2pc supplementary material .",
    "the phase data is then corrected for this phase offset to ensure that the ( arbitrary ) 2pc definition of phase zero is maintained in this analysis so that the defined _ off _ phase region remains valid .",
    "6 .   within each energy bin ,",
    "a cut on phase is applied and events which fall within the _ off _ phase region and those which fall outside this region - the _ on _ phase region - are selected . the ratio of the size of the _ on _ phase range to the size of the _ off _ phase range , defined as @xmath8 ,",
    "is then used to scale the number of event counts in the _ off _ phase region ( n@xmath9 ) to the number in the _ on _ region ( n@xmath10 ) .",
    "the number of excess pulsed events is then defined as n@xmath11@xmath12n@xmath10@xmath13@xmath8n@xmath9 and the flux is n@xmath14 divided by the exposure ( @xmath15 ) calculated in step 3 using ` gtexposure ` .",
    "the significance of the excess is calculated using equation  17 from @xcite .    following this procedure we derive the energy distributions for the _ on _ and _ off _ phase regions , and the instrument exposure , for all 115 pulsars under study .",
    "these distributions , along with the derived ap sed , are shown for the crab pulsar in figure  [ fig : crab ] .",
    "the seds for several other pulsars derived using the ap method are plotted in figure  [ fig : sed ] . using the ap method ,",
    "19 pulsars are detected above 10  gev and all , bar one , appear in the _ fermi_-lat catalog of sources above 10  gev @xcite .",

    ".properties of 19 pulsars detected in the 10 - 17  gev energy bin with the ap method whose excess exceed 3@xmath16 .",
    "the crab pulsar is excluded from the stacking analysis but is included here for completeness .",
    "the excesses , fluxes and significances are quoted for the 10 - 17  gev energy range only .",
    "all entries , bar psr  j1732@xmath133131 , are also listed in the 1fhl catalog .",

    "following a stacked analysis of 115 gamma - ray pulsars , with an average exposure of @xmath04.2  yr per pulsar , we find no evidence of cumulative emission above 50  gev .",
    "stacked searches exclusive to the young pulsars , the millisecond pulsars , and several other promising sub - samples also return no significant excesses above 50  gev .",
    "any average emission present in the entire pulsar sample is limited to be below @xmath07% of the crab pulsar in the 56 - 100  gev band and to be below @xmath030% in the 100 - 177  gev band .",
    "the average flux limits presented in table  [ tab : stacksummary ] are roughly 3 times lower than the best flux limits achieved in dedicated individual pulsar analyses done in the 2pc in the 56 - 100  gev band .",
    "one should note that a limit on the average flux from 115 pulsars at 7% of the crab pulsar level is consistent with , for example , a scenario in which all 115 pulsars emit at 7% of the crab pulsar level .",
    "it is also consistent with a scenario in which 8 pulsars emit at 100% the level of the crab pulsar and the remaining 107 pulsars have zero emission .",
    "therefore this analysis does not exclude the possibility of finding several pulsars which are as bright as the crab pulsar above 50 gev , or several dozen which are ten times dimmer.130% of the crab pulsar level in the 50@xmath13100  gev energy range @xcite . ]",
    "it does , however , constrain the average flux from the ensemble , and therefore for every individual pulsar detected above this flux limit , the average emission from the remaining pulsars is constrained to be further below the limit .    in the 100  mev to @xmath050",
    "gev energy range we find that the average seds returned from the young pulsar and millisecond pulsar stacking analyses are very similar in shape and are generally compatible with a power law times a sub - exponential cutoff . @xcite and @xcite have shown that a sub - exponential cutoff function approximates a superposition of exponential cutoffs , thus the appearance of a sub - exponential cutoff in the ensemble sed is to be expected within a curvature radiation model .",
    "we note , however , that the highest energy spectral point is higher than the best fit sub - exponential cutoff function at the @xmath02.4@xmath16 level in both the young pulsar and millisecond pulsar cases .",
    "this can not be taken as strong evidence for a non - exponentially - suppressed pulsar emission component aggregating in the stacked analysis , however , the available data can not rule it out beyond the level of the limits shown in figures  [ fig : patot ] ,  [ fig : patotyp ] and [ fig : patotmsp ] and table  [ tab : stacksummary ] .    at energies above 100  gev , individual pulsar limits made by air cherenkov telescopes are much stronger than those achievable with the _ fermi_-lat . the sensitivity necessary to detect the crab pulsar emission above 100  gev at the @xmath05@xmath16 level",
    "is achieved by veritas in under 30  hrs , for example . beyond this work",
    ", improvements can be made using the forthcoming _",
    "fermi_-lat pass-8 data release which will improve the _",
    "fermi_-lat acceptance by @xmath025% at 100  gev @xcite .",
    "improvements to this stacking analysis can also be made by employing a likelihood framework to stack the sources ( see @xcite for example ) , rather than the simple _ on _ minus _ off _ procedure described here .",
    "the flux sensitivity of any stacking analysis will , however , ultimately be bounded by the exposure of the _ fermi_-lat .",
    "the dashed - line histograms ( one over the total exposure ) in figures  [ fig : patot ] ,  [ fig : patotyp ] and [ fig : patotmsp ] indicate that limits derived in this analysis are factors of @xmath04@xmath1320 times larger than the minimum measurable average flux in the 100@xmath13177 gev range . a future stacking analysis which doubles both the number of pulsars and the duration of observation used will increase the exposure term by factor of 4 , indicating that future stacking analyses which do not yeild detections may improve on the limits presented here by perhaps one or two orders of magnitude .",
