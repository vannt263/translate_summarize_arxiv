    "the history and status of the @xmath5-meson has been quite vacillating ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . a scalar - isoscalar state with a mass of @xmath6 was originally proposed in the fifties  @xcite as an ingredient of the nucleon - nucleon force providing saturation and binding in nuclei . along the years ,",
    "there has always been some arbitrariness in the `` effective '' or `` fictitious '' @xmath5 meson mass and the coupling constant to the nucleon , partly due to the lack of other sources of information .",
    "for instance , in the very successful charge dependent ( cd ) bonn nn - potential  @xcite , any partial wave @xmath7-channel is fitted with a different scalar - isoscalar meson mass and coupling .",
    "the @xmath5-meson was also introduced as the chiral partner of the pion to account for spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the lack of confidence in its existence motivated taking its mass to infinity , yielding the non - linear sigma model  @xcite , which is the modern starting point for the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .    during the last decade ,",
    "the situation has steadily changed , and the @xmath5-meson has been finally resurrected  @xcite , culminating with the inclusion of the @xmath8 resonance in the particle data group review ( pdg )  @xcite as the @xmath9 state , seen as a @xmath10 resonance .",
    "it has wide - spread values for the mass , @xmath11 , and for the width , @xmath12  @xcite . a rigorous definition of the @xmath5 as a @xmath10 resonance requires that it be a pole of the @xmath10 scattering amplitude in the @xmath13 channel in the second riemann sheet in the mandelstam variable @xmath14 .",
    "within such a framework , the uncertainties have recently been narrowly sharpened with a benchmark determination based on the roy equations with constraints from the chiral symmetry  @xcite , yielding the value   variable .",
    "a better one is @xmath15 , which coincides with the previous one in the narrow resonance limit . ]",
    "@xmath16 the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite yields a result with somewhat higher @xmath17 , @xmath18  mev ( with the errors statistical and systematic , respectively ) , while the unitarized chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath19pt ) gives a bit lower value of the mass , @xmath20  mev  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , various determinations of the pole mass agree with the values ( [ 444 ] ) within the uncertainties .",
    "these accurate determinations make somewhat tricky the original question on _ what _",
    "@xmath5 mass should be used _ a priori _ within a meson - exchange picture , due to the very large width of the resonance . moreover",
    ", the determinations mentioned above do not imply necessarily the standard assignment of the linear sigma - model where one takes @xmath21 as chiral partners in the @xmath22 representation of the chiral @xmath23 group .",
    "a priori , the @xmath5 state could also belong to the @xmath24 representation .",
    "admittedly , the heated debate on the nature of the @xmath5 meson is not completely over , with the tetraquark  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) or glueball interpretations  @xcite considered ( see , e.g , ref .",
    "@xcite and numerous references therein ) .",
    "our goal in the present paper is to point out that the large-@xmath1 regge models may provide valuable insight into this problem . clearly , the numbers in eq .",
    "( [ 444 ] ) represent the values for @xmath25 .",
    "we recall that in the large-@xmath1 limit qcd can be mapped onto a theory of _ infinitely _ many stable and non - interacting mesons and glueballs  @xcite . in the standard large-@xmath1 counting ,",
    "meson and glueball masses are both @xmath26 whereas their widths are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "however , there is also a large-@xmath1-suppressed mass shift which makes a literal use of eq .",
    "( [ 444 ] ) somewhat questionable .",
    "actually , lattice calculations have shown that qcd@xmath29 is generally not too far from qcd at @xmath25  ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , at least for certain observables .",
    "the lightest scalar - isoscalar state ( commonly denoted by @xmath5 ) , due to its unusually large width , seems to be an exceptional case , and in this paper we try to address its nature and phenomenological consequences within the framework of the large-@xmath1 regge models .",
    "large-@xmath1-motivated investigations for the @xmath10 or nn interactions keep only the lowest @xmath8 state , and hence constitute the low - energy analyses ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for an early investigation ) .",
    "the studies of the @xmath10 scattering , based on a large-@xmath1 scaling of the @xmath25 parameters and unitarized via the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) applied to the @xmath19pt amplitudes , provide an @xmath1 dependence of resonances which , regarding the @xmath5 state , depends on the details of the scheme used . while the one - loop coupled channel approach  @xcite yields a very wide range of @xmath17 and a large width ( in an apparent contradiction with the standard",
    "large-@xmath1 counting  @xcite when extrapolated to @xmath30 ) , the two - loop approach  @xcite produces a large shift ( by a factor of @xmath31 ) of @xmath17 when going from @xmath25 to @xmath32 ( the corresponding mass shift is small in the case of the @xmath33 meson ) .",
    "one should note the large uncertainties of the two - loop iam , documented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "along similar large-@xmath1 counting , the @xmath34-matrix approach  @xcite gives @xmath35 .",
    "the bethe - salpeter approach  @xcite yields an estimate @xmath36  @xcite at @xmath37 . a more refined analysis using the large-@xmath1 consistency conditions between the unitarization and resonance saturation suggests @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "the large-@xmath1 analysis of the nn force was carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite at the quark level and in ref .",
    "@xcite at the hadronic level , providing a justification of the meson - exchange picture .",
    "moreover , it indicates _ what _",
    "mesons are the leading ones , namely the infinite tower of @xmath5 , @xmath39 , @xmath33 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , _ etc .",
    "_ , states .",
    "meson widths enter as relative @xmath42 corrections to the potential , on equal footing with many other effects ( the spin - orbit force , relativistic dynamics , or the inclusion of other mesons ) , independently on how large the @xmath5 width is in the real @xmath25 world . in this regard the large-@xmath1 analysis may provide a reliable determination of the asymptotic value of the @xmath5 mass at @xmath43 . a fit to the @xmath44 leading-@xmath1 potential yields @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown in ref .",

    "finally , we should also note that using an alternative large-@xmath1 counting  @xcite , the scalar meson behaves as a @xmath49 state  @xcite and its width is @xmath50 .    in the present work we take into account an infinite number of scalar - isoscalar states . in order to gather information on their coupling to hadrons and the vacuum",
    ", we use a regge model for the radial trajectories and study correlation functions between the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "surprisingly , we find in section  [ sec : traj ] that quite naturally _ all _ the scalar - isoscalar states can be described by a single radial regge trajectory with half the standard slope .",
    "the mass of the @xmath5 state can be deduced from this trajectory as the mass of the lowest state . as a consequence",
    ", there seems to be no obvious difference between mesons and glueballs , as far as the spectrum is concerned . despite this surprising ordering with a sort of a radial quantum number",
    ", we should warn the reader that states of different nature may not necessarily be characterized by a single quantum number and other interpretations are considered in the literature .",
    "for example , @xmath4 is often regarded as @xmath51 , @xmath52 as mainly @xmath53 , @xmath54 as mainly a glueball , and @xmath55 dominantly as @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , there is no trajectory revealing the sigma meson mass , and the observed regularity would be accidental .",
    "existing lattice studies of hadronic matrix elements of the energy - momentum tensor , the so - called gravitational form factors of the pion and nucleon , provide a very valuable complementary information on the @xmath5 properties , with the large-@xmath1 interpretation behind ( section  [ sec : grav ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the data are too noisy as to pin down the coupling of the excited scalar - isoscalar states to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "nevertheless , useful information confirming the mass estimates for the @xmath5-meson can be extracted ( sect .",
    "[ sec : grav ] ) .",
    "it is observed from the lattice data that the @xmath5 mass grows with the value of the light current quark mass in a natural way .",
    "it is interesting to discern the nature of the @xmath5 state from an analysis of a truncated spectrum .",
    "the minimum number of states , allowed by certain sum rules and low energy theorems , is just two . in section  [ sec : more_states ]",
    "we undertake such an analysis , which suggests that @xmath2 is a @xmath57 meson , while @xmath4 is a glueball .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : dim2 ] we address the rather fundamental issue of the existence of dimension-2 condensates within the context of the operator product expansion of qcd .",
    "such objects appear naturally in the regge approach and could not vanish if only a finite number of states were kept .",
    "actually , we show that the dimension-2 condensate may vanish when infinitely many states are considered , in which case a fine - tuning condition on the @xmath5 mass is needed .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] we come to our conclusions .",
    "scalar - isoscalar states listed in the pdg tables  @xcite .",

    "as we can see , an approximate straight line behavior looks quite appealing . to improve the statistics",

    "this generally introduces some model dependence and thus there may be systematic uncertainties in the masses related to the precise definition of the resonance parameters .    as we can see from eq .",

    "given the fact that all states fit quite naturally into the pattern , we see no obvious way how glueball states could be singled out solely on the basis of belonging to one of the trajectories ( [ twotraj ] ) .",
