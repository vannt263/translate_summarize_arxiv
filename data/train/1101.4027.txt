    "detections of carbon monoxide ( co ) and dust , in objects at @xmath10@xmath02 have enabled studies of the molecular gas properties in the early phases of galaxy formation ( e.g. , review by solomon & vanden bout 2005 ) .",
    "molecular gas masses @xmath11 , enriched in c and o , provide strong evidence for powerful starbursts at early epochs in objects that may have later turned into massive spirals and/or elliptical galaxies . until now , mid@xmath12 ( @xmath12=36 ) co lines and the continuum emission from dust have primarily been used to characterize the physical properties of these massive gas reservoirs .",
    "one key approach is to observe the different rotational ( @xmath12 ) transitions of co ( so  called ` co line spectral energy distribution ' , or ` co line ladder ' ) and use radiative transfer models to constrain molecular gas masses , densities , and temperatures ( see the compilation by wei et al .  2007 , 2011 , hereafter w11 ) .",
    "in such analyses , however , it is frequently found that the density and kinetic temperature of the molecular gas are degenerate , so that data from additional tracers of the gas phase would be highly desirable .",
    "such an alternative tracer of the cold molecular gas phase is atomic carbon ( ) .",
    "studies of atomic carbon in the local universe have been carried out in molecular clouds of the galactic disk , the galactic center , m82 and other nearby galaxies ( e.g. , white et al .  1994 ; stutzki et al .  1997 ; gerin & phillips 1998 ; 2000 ; ojha et al .  2001",
    "; israel & baas 2002 ; schneider et al .",
    "2003 , israel 2005 ) .",
    "these studies have shown that is closely associated with the co emission independent of environment . since the critical density for the and lines are both @xmath13",
    ", this finding suggests that the transitions arise from the same volume and share similar excitation temperatures ( e.g. ikeda et al .",
    "2002 ) . for reference ,",
    "the critical densities for the  and  lines are 1@xmath1410@xmath15@xmath16 and 3@xmath1410@xmath15@xmath16 , respectively ( schier et al.2005 ) . as pointed out by papadopoulos et al .",
    "( 2004 ) such a close connection between  and co was not expected from early theoretical work ( tielens & hollenbach 1985a , 1985b ) , where the  emission was thought to emerge from a narrow //co transition zone in molecular clouds .    because the @xmath15p fine - structure system of atomic carbon forms a simple three - level system , detection of both optically thin carbon lines ,  ( rest frequency : 492.161ghz , hereafter ) and  ( rest frequency : 809.344ghz , hereafter ) , enables one to derive the excitation temperature , neutral carbon column density and mass independently of any other information ( e.g. , ojha et al.2001 , wei  et al .",
    "a combination of this method ( using ) with the aforementioned co seds is particularly powerful as it eliminates some of the degeneracy frequently found in co radiative transfer models .",
    "therefore , assuming that  and co trace similar volumes on galactic scales , the carbon excitation temperature allows us to pin down the co excitation conditions , as the excitation temperature of  and co(10 ) are expected to be similar .",
    "previous observations of  at high redshift ( see references given in section  4 and the related table ) have shown that both the and  lines are typically significantly fainter than the respective co lines at similar frequencies ( partly because they are typically optically thin ) . in this paper",
    "we report on observations of atomic carbon towards 10 high  redshift sources ( a total of 16 lines ) that encompass both submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) as well as quasar host galaxies ( qsos ) .",
    "these observations roughly double the number of high  z  line detections that have been presented in the literature previously ( in a dozen papers ) . in section  2",
    "we present the observations that have been obtainted with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( hereafter : pdbi ) as well as the iram 30 m telescope . in section  3",
    "we discuss the observations of the individual sources .",
    "we compare the  properties ( including sources from the literature ) in section  4 .",

    "given the expected faintness of the  emission line we have selected sources that are bright in co emission .",
    "we have mostly targeted quasars using the iram 30 m telescope as their linewidths are typically small ( @xmath23kms@xmath19 ) , to minimize susceptibility to low  frequency baseline instablities in the single dish observations .",

    "the smgs have been selected to be in the redshift range 2.03@xmath25z@xmath252.81 so that both  transitions can be observed in the 2 and 1 mm bands of the pdbi and 30 m telescope . as discussed in the individual sources below , some of the smgs host an agn , i.e.  the two populations that have historically been referred to as smgs and quasars do overlap .",
