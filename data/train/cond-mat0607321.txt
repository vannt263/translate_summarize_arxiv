    "clay particles are examples of charged colloidal plates with diameters in the range from nanometer to micrometer . besides their technological importance in applications such as agriculture ( as soil ) , construction ( in concrete ) , filling ( in cosmetics , rubber , plastic , etc . ) , coating ( of paper ) , and oil - drilling ( as rheological fluids for oil recovery ) , clay suspensions play an important role in basic research because they exhibit a complex phase behavior in terms of packing and orientation of the platelike particles @xcite .",
    "examples include sol - gel transitions , flocculation , aging , and even liquid crystalline phases depending on numerous parameters such as particle size , shape , charge , polydispersity , ionic strength , solvent , temperature , and external fields .",
