    "recent advances in the experimental techniques of cold atomic ensembles and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have sparked the interests of researchers in their application toward quantum information tasks , in particular quantum metrology @xcite and quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "for quantum computing , the traditional view is that single ( or effectively single ) particle systems are preferable , with the leading candidates being qubits made with ion trap , superconducting , n - v center , quantum dot , and photon technologies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless quantum memories based on ensembles , rather than single particles , remain attractive due to both experimental advantages and fundamental differences to qubit approaches .",
    "several approaches have been proposed for the use of ensembles as quantum memories in quantum information processing applications .",
    "the first is a collective state encoding where excited states involving all the particles in the ensemble are used @xcite . in such schemes",
    "discrete states are used to encode the quantum information , and has been used to perform fundamental tasks such as quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "the second approach is to use the ensembles to approximate continuous variable quadrature variables @xcite . in this approach",
    "only states that are in the vicinity of a particular total spin polarization direction ( usually taken to be @xmath0 ) are used , and the remaining total spins are used as the quadratures ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 in this case ) .",
    "another approach is to take advantage of the similarity of the mathematical structure of spin coherent states to qubits , to perform quantum information processing much in the same way as qubits , but using ensembles @xcite .    in order to measure the state of atomic ensembles and becs ,",
    "various optical imaging techniques including absorption imaging @xcite , fluorescent imaging @xcite and phase contrast imaging ( pci ) @xcite have been developed .",
    "pci is an example of a non - destructive technique which does not destroy the bec itself during the measurement process .",
    "it is also a weak measurement in the sense that the quantum state is approximately preserved after the measurement process @xcite , as the number of scattered photons in the measurement can be made negligible .",
    "this opens the opportunity to use such methods beyond measurements , and can be incorporated to perform quantum control of the ensemble .",
    "such a scheme was experimentally demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where atomic ensembles affected by collective noise were weakly measured optically , and corrected back to their original position on the bloch sphere .",
    "this allows for a way to fight decoherence for collective noise in such ensembles by continuously ( weakly ) measuring the ensemble .",
    "this technique is also of relevance to atomic clocks to reduce the frequency noise of a local oscillator @xcite .     the phase contrast imaging ( pci ) measurement based quantum feedback control scheme considered in this paper . the atom ensemble or bec",
    "is illuminated with an ac stark shift laser , which is affected witha phase shift depending on the state of the atoms .",
    "the phase shift is measured via a homodyne measurement and converted to an electrical signal .",
    "the detected signal is processed by a controller which feeds back to the bec to control the state of the atoms via a collective operation . ]    in the quantum feedback approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the aim is to stabilize one particular state by detecting the small deviations from the target state , and applying a rotation to counteract the original noise .",
    "a more general task is to target an arbitrary state given an arbitrary initial state , where the deviation is not necessarily small .",
    "such tasks are central to quantum control theory @xcite , and have been successfully applied to atomic and molecular physics as well as physical chemistry @xcite .",
    "these have been mainly analyzed for systems with small hilbert space dimensions such as qubits @xcite , however , in the above context it is an important task to extend this towards systems involving many particles .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop quantum control methods to the atomic ensembles and becs , so that one can drive an arbitrary state towards a given target state .",
    "we note that there have been previous works that have also investigated quantum control problems relating to becs @xcite .",
    "these have been mainly focused on controlling the spatial modes of the bec , and thereby driving the system into the ground state . in our study",
    "we will instead consider rather the internal degrees of freedom of a two - component spinor bec .",
    "whether the state can be effectively controlled is of high relevance to applications such as quantum information processing where the ensemble or bec is used as a quantum memory .",
    "more specifically , we will devise a quantum feedback scheme based continuous pci measurements and control .",

    "the atom ensemble is illuminated by a laser field which induces an ac stark shift upon the atoms . for an ensemble with internal degrees of freedom , this is an entangling interaction , and the light carries information relating to the internal state of the atoms @xcite .",
    "the light is interfered using homodyne detectors and the measurement result is compared with the desired value of the output .",
    "based on this control signal , the ensemble is controlled by a collective operation using a suitable control law . in quantum feedback control ,",
    "the stochastic master equation ( sme ) plays an important role for the design of the feedback control system since it allows us to calculate both the state of the system conditioned on a given set of measurement outcomes .",

    "here we rederive the conditional master equation ( [ conditional - master1 ] ) for the case of ensembles .",
    "consider an ensemble of @xmath85 atoms labeled by an index @xmath210 , each having two ground states @xmath211 which serve as the logical states .",
    "each ground state state has an excited state which connected by a photon of suitable polarization and are labeled @xmath212 .",
    "the energy of the states may be written @xmath213 illumination with an off - resonant electromagnetic field and adiabatic elimination of the excited states gives an effective hamiltonian @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 is the polarization vector .",
    "here we have assumed that the strength of the electromagnetic field is homogenous for all the atoms in the ensemble , such that the @xmath210-dependence drops out .",
    "now that the excited states have been eliminated , we henceforth drop the ground state labels and write @xmath217 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce operators @xmath218 such that the total spin operators are @xmath219 the effective hamiltonian can thus be written in the same form as ( [ spin - form - h ] ) .",
    "the measurement operator then takes the same form as ( [ measop ] ) but with @xmath220 the remaining steps from ( [ dexpr ] ) to ( [ conditional - master1 ] ) then follow in the same way but with a redefinition of the spin operators as above ."

    "<S> cold atomic ensembles and spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are potential candidates for quantum memories as they have long coherence times and can be coherently controlled . unlike most candidates for quantum memories which are genuine or effective single particle systems , in atomic ensembles the quantum information is stored as a spin coherent state involving a very large number of atoms . a typical task with such ensembles is to drive the state towards a particular quantum state . while such quantum control methods are well - developed for qubit systems , it is a non - trivial task to extend quantum control methods to the many - particle case . </S>",
    "<S> the objective of this work is to deterministically steer an arbitrary state of the atomic ensemble into a desired spin coherent state . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we design our control law using stochastic stability theory , the quantum filtering theorem , and phase contrast imaging . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our control laws to different axes and show that it is possible to manipulate the atoms into different target states . </S>"
