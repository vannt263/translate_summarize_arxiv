    "recently , a growing body of evidence for the existence of a many - body localized ( mbl ) phase has emerged @xcite , and now it includes a rigorous proof for a physically reasonable one - dimensional lattice model @xcite as well as experimental signatures from cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and trapped ions @xcite .",
    "a distinguishing feature of the mbl phase is a complete set of local integrals of motion @xcite .",
    "the existence of such integrals implies that the system retains memory of the initial conditions and external manipulations imposed on it .",
    "this naturally leads to a potential use of the mbl phase for quantum information processing @xcite , and in particular for storing quantum information @xcite .    on the practical side ,",
    "a drawback for applications of the mbl phase is that local integrals , sometimes referred to as  l - bits \" , may have small overlap with the physically observable / manipulatable degrees of freedom (  p - bits \" ) , e.g. the on - site occupation numbers or spin states . from the point of view of quantum control or quantum computing ,",
    "one desires a strong overlap between l - bits and p - bits to ensure high fidelity of physically addressable quantities .",
    "in particular , in a quantum computer one requires all excitations initialized on - site to remain there for a sufficient time , typically given by a coherence time set by residual coupling to the environment or noise .",
    "the site localization , which we shall colloquially refer to as _ confinement _ , is a stronger constraint than the exponential decay of the wavefunction at large distances .",
    "confinement of all states does not occur in a system with a random or incommensurate potential even for nearest neighbor hopping that we consider in this paper .",
    "this is because the probability to find two neighboring sites with energy difference smaller than the hopping amplitude @xmath0 is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the bandwidth of site energies and the distribution of the site energies is assumed uniform . as a result the excitations will hybridize between the sites over a time @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 per excitation @xcite .        for non - interacting excitations ,",
    "resonant hopping can be suppressed by explicitly _ constructing _ an appropriate  disorder \" of the site energy sequence @xcite .",
    "this is done for a finite bandwidth of the site energies by successively tuning them so that the further away the sites are the smaller is the detuning .",
    "one can thus achieve near unity l - bit / p - bit overlap of an infinite number of states .",
    "the situation is significantly complicated by the presence of many - body interactions even where the interaction is short - range .",
    "this is a consequence of the exponential increase of the number of states with the number of excitations .",
    "one could therefore expect it to become impossible to fully suppress all many - body resonances in a large system for a finite site energy bandwidth , that is , to have the energy difference between different distributions of the excitations over sites larger than the matrix element of hopping between these distributions .",
    "we emphasize that this condition is not required in the mbl .",
    "the strong many - body confinement of excitations on sites is a strictly transient phenomenon even in the presence of the mbl .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of optimizing the time on which , in a many - body system , excitations remain closely bound to the sites on which they were prepared .",
    "we call this time the localization lifetime @xcite .",
    "the optimization is achieved by tuning site energies .",
    "such tuning was recently implemented in trapped ion systems in order to achieve the mbl @xcite .",
    "however , the mbl is not required to optimize the localization lifetime .",
    "the lifetime formulation is meaningful independent of the structure of stationary eigenstates .",
    "our analysis is also different from the problem of time evolution in the mbl systems @xcite .",
    "further motivation for studying the localization lifetime comes from the fact that , in realistic systems , the bath coupling and noise can not be fully turned off , and the eigenstate character of the closed system is relevant only for times smaller than the decay or decoherence times induced by the environment .    in terms of quantum information processing ,",
    "it is important to maximize the ratio of the hopping amplitude to the bandwidth @xmath4 while maintaining a long localization lifetime .",
    "parameter @xmath0 characterizes the rate of two - qubit operations , whereas @xmath5 determines the characteristic bandwidth of the control field ( for example , radiation ) coupled to qubits , which is usually limited in the experiment @xcite .",
    "here we propose a construction of the disorder that enables having the localization lifetime that scales as a high power of the large parameter @xmath6 .",
    "a key observation that makes our approach different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite is that this can be accomplished by using a one - dimensional chain with a * periodic * sequence of site energies .",
    "the periodicity grossly simplifies the construction .",
    "it also brings in the translational symmetry , which allows one to think of the band structure of many - body excitations .",
    "the reciprocal widths of the many - excitation bands in a periodic system limits the many - excitation localization lifetime . in a sense , this is a weak constraint on the number of excitations involved , as the width quickly falls off as this number increases .",
    "however , the problem is not only to have the bands narrow , but also to eliminate many - excitation resonances within the period of the sequence . as we show",
    ", we can construct a periodic sequence of site energies in such a way that the scaling of the localization lifetime with @xmath4 holds uniformly for any number of excitations for the period equal to 6 sites .",
    "the robustness of the sequence is guaranteed by the fact that the site energies are given by simple fractions of their bandwidth @xmath5 with a small common denominator .",
    "for the same reason , a strict periodicity of the sequence is not required either .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional model of interacting spinless fermions , or equivalently an anisotropic heisenberg spin one - half chain .",
    "it is described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are fermionic creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath10 , @xmath11 . , and we set @xmath12 .",

    "( [ eq : h ] ) allows us to talk about particles rather than excitations , and this is the language we will be using in what follows .",

    "the parameter @xmath25 can be compared with the ratio of the rate of a two - qubit operation to the decoherence rate , which is often smaller then @xmath26 in the current implementations of quantum computers",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "an advantageous feature of a periodic site energy sequence is that it allows one to characterize dynamic properties of an infinite chain by analyzing small segments on the order of the period .",
    "a basic problem is the account of many - particle resonances where different configurations @xmath28 have the same energy @xmath29 .",
    "it is necessary to eliminate resonances between all single - particle inter - site transitions within the period , all two - particle transitions , etc .",
    "such transitions come from the hopping term @xmath30 in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "an important characteristic is the number of single - particle  steps \" between neighboring sites @xmath31 involved in a resonant transition .",
    "out of @xmath31 steps , @xmath32 are virtual nonresonant transitions .    in calculating @xmath31 one should take into account that a many - particle transition would not occur unless the particles interact with each other .",
    "this only happens when they are on neighboring sites .",
    "therefore the steps must include bringing the particles to neighboring sites . as a result",
    ", the total amplitude of the many - particle transition contains a factor @xmath33 and factor @xmath34 raised to the power that shows how many interactions are involved .",
    "the period of the sequence @xmath35 gives the maximal number of steps for a resonant single - particle transition ; in this case @xmath36 .",
    "we now consider a potentially resonant two - particle transition from sites @xmath37 to sites @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , with all sites within the period @xmath35 .",
    "the number of steps for such a transition is bound by @xmath40 , because the particles have first to make virtual transitions from @xmath37 to some neighboring sites @xmath41 , where they interact , and then move away to @xmath38 .",
    "a more detailed explanation and the analysis of the contribution from the transitions between sites separated by more than @xmath35 is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : many - particle ] .",
    "our goal is to eliminate all many - particle resonances . as a first step ,",
    "we want to do so within a period .",
    "the above estimate shows that , to eliminate resonances for all single- and two - particle transitions on equal footing , we should set @xmath42 .",
    "as we show later , for @xmath42 we can also eliminate 5-step resonances for a larger number of particles . as it turns out , here a critical consideration of 3-particle resonances must be made .",
    "we show that such resonances give a subleading contribution compared to single - particle resonances for @xmath27 .",
    "these arguments make the period @xmath42 special .    to achieve robustness with respect to errors in the site energies , we choose these energies as _ simple fractions _ of the bandwidth @xmath5 , @xmath43 with integer @xmath44 and @xmath45 and with @xmath46 ; without loss of generality we set @xmath47 .",
    "the magnitude of all distinct many - particle energy differences are bounded from below by @xmath48 , where @xmath45 is the least common denominator of the energy sequence . the problem",
    "is then reduced to finding a proper set @xmath49 , with minimal @xmath45 , where all many - body energy differences are distinct .",
    "this is a formidable problem when many particles are considered , and @xmath45 is expected to grow with the increasing number of particles , leading to a loss in robustness .",
    "it also rapidly grows with the increasing period @xmath35 , which provides another motivation for keeping @xmath35 not too large .    in order to maximize the localization lifetime , for our period-6 sequence we choose the values of the site energies so that    a.   there are no one - particle , two - particle or three - particle resonances up to order @xmath50 .",
    "b.   the difference between energies of neighboring sites should be maximized , and in each case exceed roughly one half the total bandwidth .",
    "these heuristic conditions together can provide a long localization lifetime @xmath20 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] )",
    ". resonant transitions of an initially localized on - site state require multiple nonresonant steps , so that their amplitude starts from @xmath50 .",
    "this appears to be true also for four and five - particle resonances and is trivially satisfied for resonances that involve moving more than 5 particles .    condition ( i ) requires that all numerators within a period must be distinct , @xmath51 for all @xmath52 $ ] to avoid single - particle resonances .",
    "similarly , the absence of two - particle resonances is equivalent to @xmath53 for all pairwise distinct @xmath54 . given that @xmath47 , the single - particle constraint makes @xmath55 to be at least @xmath56 , but the many - particle constraints are much harder to satisfy .",
    "with these constraints , @xmath45 increases with @xmath35 superlinearly .",
    "a sufficient procedure to satisfy the condition of the absence of one- and two - particle resonances entails building the sequence @xmath13 term by term . for two sites the solution for the integer set @xmath49 with minimal @xmath45 , written in ascending order of the elements , is \\{0,1 } ( with @xmath57 ) , while for three and four sites it is @xmath58 ( with @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 ) , respectively .",
    "one may notice that the next term in the brackets of the sequence can be obtained recursively in terms of the two prior terms in the brackets as @xmath62 for @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "such a sequence is a shifted version of the celebrated fibonacci sequence @xmath65 , expressible as @xmath66 for @xmath67 . respectively , @xmath68 for @xmath42 .",
    "although the structure of the shifted fibonacci sequence is sufficient to guarantee the absence of all one - particle and two - particle resonances , it suffers from the three - particle resonance @xmath69 and would not satisfy ( ii ) upon any reordering .",
    "remarkably , by modifying @xmath70 and @xmath71 we also eliminate all three - particle resonances in the unit cell , and thus ( i ) is satisfied .",
    "the sequence can be reordered to satisfy ( ii ) .",
    "this gives @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "the above analysis assumes that no many - particle _ inter-_peiod resonances arise , that is , all transitions happen between sites separated by no more than @xmath42 positions . while this is guaranteed by construction at the one - particle level , in sec .",

    "a dramatic drop of @xmath200 occurs for very strong coupling where @xmath144 approaches the minimum site energy difference @xmath169 . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : hartree ] , this drop is a consequence of the coupling - induced resonances between site energies separated by two sites .",
    "one can also see the expected narrow dips of @xmath215 for @xmath218 .",
    "they correspond to the coupling - induced resonances between site energies separated by 4 sites and are therefore much weaker than the resonance for @xmath187 .",
    "these resonances obviously involve `` fine tuning '' .",
    "overall the numerical results demonstrate robust long localization lifetime in the considered strongly coupled many - particle system .",
    "in this paper we have examined the dynamics of a one - dimensional many - body system from the perspective of the localization lifetime @xmath20 , i.e. , the time during which all particles ( or equivalently , all excitations ) remain on the sites they were initially placed , with a very large probability . to achieve a long localization lifetime one may not rely on the randomness of site energies , rather the `` disorder '' has to be constructed .",
    "we have proposed a simple sequence of site energies that , even for a strong particle - particle interaction , makes the amplitudes of all resonant many - particle transitions scale as a high power of the ratio of the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath0 to the single - particle energy bandwidth @xmath5 .",
    "the localization lifetime is determined by the inverse of this amplitude .    somewhat unexpectedly , it turned out that the site energies can be chosen as a periodic sequence . for the considered model with nearest - neighbor hopping and short - range coupling",
    ", our period-6 sequence provides the same scaling for the many- and single - particle localization lifetime , @xmath219 .",
    "the periodicity of the sequence has made it possible to study the localization lifetime analytically .",
    "the numerical results have confirmed the theory .    a long localization lifetime and its scaling as a high power of @xmath92 is advantageous for applications of many - body systems in quantum information .",
    "it shows that , even where the coupling can not be switched off , excitations can remain for a long time on the sites they were created and can be read out , while two - qubit operations can be done over a much shorter time @xmath220 . in this context , a small delocalization @xmath221 related to nonresonant inter - site hybridization of excitations should be compared to the error of the control and readout and can be reduced by changing @xmath4 .    even though the present formulation differs from the conventional problem of many - body localization ,",
    "the results are closely related to this problem .",
    "indeed , since the amplitudes of all resonant many - particle transitions can be made very small even in a periodic system , already a weak site disorder , with width @xmath222 , will break the periodicity and could be sufficient for localization of the stationary states .",
    "the study of such localization is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "meanwhile , it is clear from our analysis that a weak site disorder will not affect the localization lifetime .",
