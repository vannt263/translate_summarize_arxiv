    "present theoretical tools for calculating strong field ionization of atoms and molecules fall into two categories , 1 ) semianalytical theories based the strong field approximation @xcite and/or adk theory @xcite , often with improvements over the traditional formulation to incorporate molecular targets @xcite , and 2 ) direct time - dependent numerical solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the first category suffers from approximations necessary to allow a semianalytical treatment , most notably the neglect of the target - specific binding potential of the molecular core on the ionization , continuum , and recollision dynamics .",
    "the second category has the shortcoming that full numerical treatment becomes impossible as the number of degrees of freedom increases .",
    "time - dependent numerical solutions of the schrdinger equation including a strong laser field is only feasible for one- or two - particle systems .",
    "steps have been made along the numerical route to incorporate multielectron effects into strong field dynamics through the use of time - dependent hartree - fock theory @xcite , multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree - fock @xcite , time - dependent configuration interaction singles @xcite , and time - dependent density - functional theory @xcite .    in this work",
    "we address both the problems of including the binding potential consistently throughout the strong field dynamics as well as the problem of accounting for a major fraction of multielectron effects .",
    "in particular , motivated by recent experiments demonstrating effects of multiple final ionic states in high harmonic generation ( hhg ) @xcite , we focus on a multiple ionic channel effects in strong field ionization which is the first step in hhg .",
    "we consider only the electronic problem , with the nuclei held fixed and work in the length gauge .",
    "our approach to strong field ionization of multielectron targets combines _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry multielectron wavefunctions with single particle time - dependent numerical grid solutions .",
    "we use as a basis the field - free @xmath1-electron neutral and the lowest few ( @xmath1 - 1)-electron singly ionized states .",
    "any coupling to the multiply - charged ionic states is neglected .",
    "the wavefunction of the @xmath2 continuum electron associated with each ionic state is represented by a 3d cartesian numerical grid .",
    "equations of motion describing the evolution and coupling of the basis state amplitudes and the @xmath2 electron wavefunction are derived from the multielectron schrdinger equation and contain no adjustable parameters .",
    "our method is closely related to the r - matrix theory of electron - molecular scattering @xcite .",
    "we use the identical wave function ansatz .",
    "r - matrix theory accounts for antisymmetrization exactly and is applicable to time - independent problems while our formalism includes antisymmetrization approximately but can be applied to time - dependent problems .    as a first example",
    ", we apply the method to the strong field ionization of co@xmath0 .",
    "a recent experiment @xcite found that predictions made using mo - adk for strong field ionization of co@xmath0 failed to account for the experimental angle - resolved ionization yields .",
    "strong field ioniozation of this molecule has also been theoretically analysed in recent papers using tddft in ref.@xcite and single - channel frozen - core approach in ref.@xcite .",
    "following our analysis presented below , we suggest that an intermediate excitation channel not considered in ref.@xcite is responsible . in this channel , first an excitation of the outer - lying electron occurs concomitant with an ionic core excitation .",
