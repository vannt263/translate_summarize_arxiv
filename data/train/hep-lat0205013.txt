    "the most prominent example of an exact duality transformation in statistical mechanics is the transformation for the two - dimensional ising model  @xcite .",
    "it is an exact transformation which changes the variables of the full partition function of the model and maps the high temperature regime of the original model to the low temperature regime of the dual model and conversely ( for the ising model , the original and the dual model coincide ) .    in the following , we make use of the correspondence of quantum field theory in the euclidean ( imaginary time ) formulation in @xmath8 space dimensions plus time with equilibrium statistical mechanics in @xmath9 dimensions and often use the words _ path integral _ , _ action _ and _ coupling _ for _ partition function _ , _ energy _ and _ temperature _ , respectively .",
    "the duality transformation of the ising model was subsequently generalized to more general lattice systems with @xmath10 symmetries  @xcite , namely systems in @xmath8-dimensions whose variables are @xmath10-valued @xmath11-forms , @xmath12 ,  spin models with global @xmath10 symmetry , pure lattice gauge theories with local @xmath10 gauge symmetry , theories for @xmath10-valued antisymmetric tensor fields and so on , and to their counterparts with @xmath13-symmetries  @xcite , in particular to the @xmath14-model and pure @xmath13 gauge theory on the lattice  @xcite . for lattice models with abelian symmetries",
    ", there exists an essentially complete picture  @xcite , and the systems to which the duality transformation applies , include even some higgs models  @xcite , namely @xmath13-lattice gauge theory minimally coupled to a @xmath13-valued scalar field ,  a higgs field with frozen radial component .",
    "all these examples of the abelian duality transformation have some features in common .",
    "they map the strong coupling regime of the original model to the weak coupling regime of the dual model .",
    "this is a consequence of the change of variables employed in the transformation which essentially involves the fourier decomposition of the interaction terms @xmath15 for some action @xmath16 .",
    "for example , this replaces @xmath13-variables by integers @xmath17 and maps boltzmann weights with narrow peaks to weights with wide peaks and conversely .",
    "the structure of the dual model can be sketched as follows . if , say in a sigma model , the variables are originally associated with the points of the lattice and the interaction terms with the bonds , then the variables of the dual model which are introduced by the fourier expansion , are located at the bonds . in a second step one",
    "removes the old variables by performing the relevant sums or integrals which yields additional boltzmann weights , often constraints , for each point .    as a consequence of the strong - weak nature of the duality transformation ,",
    "the dual partition function contains essential information on the strong coupling expansion of the original model .",
    "in fact , if one understands how the fourier coefficients of the boltzmann weight depend on the coupling , the summands of the dual partition function are precisely the terms of the strong coupling expansion and can be sorted by the magnitude of their contribution at strong coupling .    a systematic generalization of these transformations to systems with non - abelian symmetries proved to be difficult .",
    "the calculation of strong coupling expansions of pure non - abelian lattice gauge theory ( see , for example  @xcite ) already exhibits some features of the dual model which one wishes to construct .",
    "fourier expansion is generalized to character decomposition , and the dual variables are irreducible representations of the symmetry group , generalizing the wave numbers of the fourier series .",
    "the main technical difficulties are firstly to solve the integrals over the variables of the original model in a systematic way , and secondly to disentangle the lattice combinatorics in order to make the structure of the dual model transparent .",
    "both problems can be overcome if one deals with the non - abelian group variables at a sufficiently abstract level and if one uses an efficient diagrammatic notation .",
    "the first examples of non - abelian generalizations were an explicit calculation for pure @xmath18 lattice gauge theory in @xmath19 dimensions  @xcite and , much less obviously , the equivalence of lattice @xmath20-theory ( similar to pure lattice yang ",
    "mills theory , but with @xmath21-functions as the boltzmann weights ) to certain topological state sum models  @xcite .",
    "this correspondence was developed in a non - perturbative approach to quantum gravity . for review articles ,",
    "see , for example  @xcite .",
    "the approach to quantum gravity by quantizing a discrete version of the gauge theory formulation of general relativity , has lead to the definition of spin foams  @xcite .",
    "a spin foam is an abstract two - complex , consisting of vertices , edges and faces whose faces are labelled with irreducible representations of some symmetry group while the edges are labelled with compatible intertwiners .",
    "spin foams can be understood as a higher dimensional analogue of spin networks .",
    "a spin network is a graph whose edges are labelled with representations and whose vertices are labelled with compatible intertwiners ( precise definitions of spin networks and spin foams are given below in section  [ sect_spinnet ] ) .",
    "spin foams provide the appropriate language for a generalization of the exact duality transformation to pure non - abelian lattice gauge theory in arbitrary dimension @xmath6 whose gauge group is a generic compact lie group @xmath0 .",
    "see  @xcite for lattice gauge theory on hypercubic lattices and  @xcite for the generalization to more general lattices and quantum groups rather than lie groups .    in this article , we extend the non - abelian duality transformation to a large class of sigma models whose variables take values in @xmath0 or @xmath2 , @xmath0 a compact lie group and @xmath7 a lie subgroup , and which have certain global or local symmetries .",
    "this includes , for example , the chiral , the @xmath22 and @xmath4 models , and the models that are obtained from minimally coupling such a sigma model to a non - abelian lattice gauge theory , for example , some generalized higgs models with frozen radial degree of freedom .",
    "the duality transformation retains its key properties , namely that it provides a strong - weak relation , that it yields a closed form of the strong coupling expansion of the original model and that it maps expectation values of the dual model to ratios of partition functions ( free energies of dislocations , vortices or monopoles ) in the original formulation and conversely .",
    "it therefore relates the fundamental variables of one formulation with some topological defects ( collective properties ) in the other .",
    "the transformation maps the original model which is formulated in terms of compact lie groups @xmath0 and @xmath7 , functions on @xmath0 and integrals over @xmath0 or @xmath2 , to the dual model which is given in terms of the irreducible representations and intertwiners of @xmath0 and @xmath7 . the transformation can be understood as a particular application of a tannaka  kren like duality relating groups to their representation categories . that these categories will appear in the dual formulation ,",
    "had already been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the dual model can be formulated using merely the language of category theory . in the simplest case",
    ", it uses the category of finite - dimensional representations of the symmetry group @xmath0 .",
    "this can be extended to more general categories that do not arise as the representation categories of compact lie groups .",
    "the generalization of lattice gauge theory to quantum groups  @xcite is one example .",
    "for more details on the relation of groups and quantum groups with certain tensor categories , see , for example  @xcite . in this article , we do not explicitly use the language of category theory , but rather present diagrams in addition to the explicit formulas so that one can easily infer the categorial formulation from these diagrams .",
    "while the configurations of the model dual to lattice gauge theory are spin foams  @xcite , one obtains spin networks as the configurations of the model dual to a sigma model .",
    "we thus call the dual models _ spin foam models _ and _ spin network models _ , respectively . as the notions of spin networks and spin foams have been developed in an approach to quantum gravity , but might not be familiar to the reader working on statistical mechanics , we try to make this article self - contained and therefore review all relevant definitions and also some background material on the representation theory of compact lie groups .",

    "we summarize some background material on the representation theory of compact lie groups and introduce a convenient diagrammatical notation . in section  [ sect_definitions",

    "this compatibility condition   is , however , not the same as in lattice gauge theory .",
    "the minimal coupling term has modified this condition so that each spin foam appearing in the dual of the gauge theory sector is bounded by the spin network that occurs in the dual of the non - linear sigma model .",
    "in other words , the spin network diagrams of the high temperature expansion of the non - linear sigma model appear as spin network functions whose expectation value is calculated under the partition function of gauge theory .",
    "the minimal coupling term of the generalized higgs model could have been found from this entirely dual point of view .",
    "in addition to the character expansion coefficients , we find under the dual partition sum several spin networks .",
    "there is one would - be spin network from the non - linear sigma model , given by the representations @xmath554 and by the intertwiners @xmath348 which extends over the entire graph .",

    "they are similar to the spin networks @xmath487 from the dual partition function of lattice gauge theory  , but include in addition a part of the spin network given by the representations @xmath554 and the intertwiners @xmath558 .",

    "the structure of the dual partition function   of the generalized higgs model can be explained in other words starting from the corresponding expression of the chiral model ( figure  [ fig_chiral_dualpart](a ) ) .",
    "first , we are concerned with the non - linear sigma model rather than with the chiral model .",
    "this was implemented by coupling elements @xmath115 to one chiral half of the model which corresponds to the top layer in figure  [ fig_chiral_dualpart](a ) , and then by averaging over the subgroup in lemma  [ lemma_cosetave ] .",
    "this averaging is the reason why the top layer of figure  [ fig_nlin_dual2](a ) consists of dashed lines ( ` would - be spin network ' ) .",
    "then we have minimally coupled lattice gauge theory to the other chiral half which corresponds to the spin network in the bottom layer of figure  [ fig_chiral_dualpart](a ) .",
    "the effect of the minimal coupling term is that lattice gauge theory just considers this spin network as an observable to which it couples its spin foams .",
    "the bottom layer of figure  [ fig_chiral_dualpart](a ) is therefore treated as the spin network function in the expectation value of lattice gauge theory , and becomes disconnected , leading to figure  [ fig_lgt_cv](c ) for lattice gauge theory and to figure  [ fig_higgs_dual](a ) for the generalized higgs model .    as usual",
    ", there is an alternative formulation of the dual partition function which uses the haar intertwiners and haar maps rather than sums over projectors .",
    "this version is given in the first equation  .",
    "as @xmath0 acts transitively on @xmath2 , one can easily fix a ` unitary ' gauge by choosing @xmath559 in   where @xmath560 is a representative of @xmath544 .",
    "this step is often convenient because it removes the scalar degrees of freedom from the model . for the duality transformation it is , however ,",
    "pointless because the corresponding symmetry is already manifest in the dual picture .    finally , the duality transformation is also available for the expectation value of the observable  .",
    "the result is stated in the following theorem which contains the most complicated formulas we are going to present .",
    "we formulate the result for the correlator in the form  .",
    "if @xmath561 is a non - normal subgroup , then the requirement that @xmath306 is @xmath0-invariant can be dropped so that one recovers the expression   for generic @xmath441 .",

    "for the special cases in which @xmath7 is normal or massive , the situation is completely analogous to the non - linear sigma model .",
    "the only changes in these cases apply to the open ends of the dashed lines labelled @xmath445 .",
    "it is possible to construct natural observables for the dual partition function of the generalized higgs model in the same way as for the non - linear sigma model and for lattice gauge theory .",
    "if these observables only probe the representations @xmath552 assigned to the edges and @xmath553 assigned to the faces , the result is the product of a dual observable of the non - linear sigma model and one of lattice gauge theory , both independent of each other .      in analogy to section  [ sect_chiral_abelian ] , we show the abelian special case of the generalized higgs model for @xmath193 , @xmath182 , in greater detail .",
    "we write @xmath573 , @xmath263 , for the variables of lattice gauge theory and @xmath574 , @xmath270 , for the sigma model .",
    "the partition function   then reads @xmath575 this is the @xmath13-higgs model studied by einhorn and savit  @xcite . the dual expression for the partition function , equation  , specializes to @xmath576 where @xmath577 and @xmath578 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath519 and @xmath517 , @xmath197 , respectively .",
    "this expression combines the dual partition function   of the @xmath14-model with that of @xmath13-lattice gauge theory and implements the minimal coupling by the compatibility condition encoded in the constraint .",
    "it agrees with the result of  @xcite before the constraint is integrated .",
    "since the labellings of the edges with integers @xmath579 and of the faces with integers @xmath580 are abelian , we can visualize   as a sum over all closed lines living on the edges together with a sum over all closed surfaces living on the faces where each surface is either closed or bounded by one of the lines .",
    "if we use the villain action for both the sigma model and gauge theory ,  @xmath581 and @xmath582 , then the total exponent of the dual boltzmann weight is the length of the lines weighted with @xmath583 plus the area of the surfaces weighted with @xmath584 .",
    "this is the effective ( open ) string model for the strong coupling regime of the @xmath13-higgs model .",
    "the observables   reduce to functions , @xmath585 which describe charges @xmath586 at the vertices @xmath270 and wilson loops @xmath587 at the edges @xmath263 provided that for each @xmath588 , the following compatibility condition holds , @xmath589 the dual of the expectation value then reads ,",
    "@xmath590  the closed lines of   now couple to the charges @xmath591 , @xmath270 , and can thus end at one of these charges while the surfaces are either closed or bounded by the lines or by the background wilson loop @xmath355 , @xmath263 .",
    "this is the picture which is generalized to sums over spin networks and spin foams in the non - abelian case .",
    "we have presented an exact duality transformation for the partition functions and expectation values of observables of the lattice chiral model , of the lattice non - linear sigma model and of a class of generalized higgs models .",
    "we conclude with various miscellaneous comments on applications , limitations and open questions .    throughout the present article ,",
    "we have chosen _ ultra - local _",
    "actions ,  the action is a sum over all edges [ or faces ] and can be calculated independently for each edge [ or face ] .",
    "a generalization to more complicated , less local , actions is straightforward .",
    "observe that the character expansion of the boltzmann weight is always a series of charges [ or spin network functions ] and that we can perform the duality transformation for generic expectation values of these charges [ or spin network functions ] .",
    "the dual form of the partition function can be used for numerical studies . from the abelian special case",
    "it is familiar ( see , for example  @xcite ) that for some observables the original model is much easier to simulate whereas for others the simulations are much more efficient in the dual model . at present ,",
    "algorithms are being developed for pure @xmath18-lattice gauge theory in three dimensions  @xcite and for a technically closely related model  @xcite in the context of quantum gravity .",
    "if one wishes to implement monte carlo algorithms for the dual model , one has to make sure that the importance sampling is applied to a positive measure .",
    "while the character expansion coefficients of the common boltzmann weights are positive , the situation is less clear for the spin networks ( such as the @xmath487 of  ) which appear under the dual partition sum .",
    "at least for the @xmath592-symmetric non - linear sigma model and for the @xmath18-symmetric chiral model , these spin networks have non - negative real values  @xcite .",
    "should there be alternating signs in other models , one has to associate the sign with the observable which is measured while the modulus can be dealt with by the importance sampling .",
    "this is familiar , for example , from the sign problems in the simulation of fermionic systems .",
    "it might finally be more than a mere coincidence that the dual partition function resembles a cluster decomposition .",
    "the lack of efficient cluster algorithms for gauge theories may have a natural explanation in the dual picture where the weights @xmath487 of lattice gauge theory are localized at the vertices as opposed to the spin network which appears in the dual sigma model and which extends over the entire lattice .",
    "we emphasize that there are intermediate steps in the duality transformation , for example   and , in which both the old and the new variables are present and which resemble an extended ` phase space ' path integral whose weight , however , does not have any obvious positivity properties . upon solving all sums",
    ", one recovers the original partition function with positive boltzmann weights while performing the integrals , one obtains the dual expression , again with positive weights ( at least in some cases which we have listed above ) .    in the abelian case ,",
    "there are higher level generalizations of sigma models and gauge theories in which the fundamental variables are located not at vertices or edges , but rather at higher level ,  at cubes , hypercubes , , and described by discretized @xmath11-forms  @xcite .",
    "this construction does not have any obvious generalization to the non - abelian case .",
    "any such model would make use of a suitable definition of non - abelian cohomology .",
    "we also stress that the non - abelian generalization of the duality transformation parallels the abelian special case only up to the point where one solves the constraints . in the non - abelian situation ,",
    "there are no longer just constraints , but rather sums over compatible intertwiners so that there exists no obvious step which generalizes the integration of the constraints .",
    "this restricts us to the original lattice as opposed to the abelian case in which one usually passes to a suitable ` dual ' lattice .",
    "this can , however , also be seen as an advantage because our generalization is therefore independent of the topology of the lattice .",
    "the case of non - trivial topology in abelian systems was studied in  @xcite .",
    "an interesting generalization of lattice gauge theory is available in @xmath593 dimensions in the dual formulation where one can replace the gauge group by a quantum group  @xcite .",
    "this includes in particular supergroups as the gauge groups .",
    "similar constructions in which the category of representations of a compact lie group in the dual formulation is replaced by more general categories , have already been known from the definition of topological invariants and from topological quantum field theory , see , for example  @xcite . from the formulas stated in the present article ,",
    "one obtains at least a formal topological invariant from the partition functions if the boltzmann weights , say , @xmath395 , are replaced by @xmath21-functions @xmath594 and similarly @xmath595 in the dual picture .",
    "non - compact lie groups have recently attracted attention in the context of quantum gravity , see , for example  @xcite .",
    "what has been missing so far is firstly a generalization which includes fermions ( this is mainly due to the still rather limited understanding of fermions in a non - perturbative formulation ) and secondly an analogue of the vortex - spin wave decomposition of  @xcite .    the present article is entirely written in the lagrangian language of path integrals and expectation values .",
    "all results are in one - to - one correspondence to the analogous statements in the hamiltonian formulation which involves the quantum statistical operator @xmath596 .",
    "matrix elements of this operator can be calculated in the dual picture from sums over spin networks and spin foams .    as far as the strong - weak relation of the duality transformation is concerned",
    ", we stress that the dual partition function provides a closed form for the strong coupling expansion which makes it possible to separate the group combinatorics from the lattice combinatorics .",
    "this has been advocated in the context of high order strong coupling expansions , see , for example  @xcite .",
    "the key to the duality transformation was to abstract from a particular group and to focus on the structures that are common to all compact lie groups .",
    "it remains a considerable challenge to evaluate the dual expressions for particular groups , boltzmann weights and shapes of the lattice .",
    "as far as the construction of strong coupling expansions in gauge theories is concerned , it is interesting to note that there exists an effective string model which describes the strong coupling regime of abelian lattice gauge theories . in the non - abelian case , however , mere strings are insufficient , and the world - sheets of the strings should rather be allowed to branch according to the combinatorics of the representation theory .",
    "a familiar example is the strong coupling calculation of the static three - quark potential in qcd .",
    "the lack of branchings of the world - sheets causes the string picture to break down when spin foams appear as the fundamental non - perturbative structure .",
    "the author is grateful to emmanuel college , cambridge , for a research fellowship .",
