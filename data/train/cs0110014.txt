    "language technology and the linguistic sciences are confronted with a vast array of _ language resources _ , richly structured , large and diverse .",
    "multiple _ communities _ depend on language resources , including linguists , engineers , teachers and actual speakers . many individuals and institutions",
    "provide key pieces of the infrastructure , including archivists , software developers , and publishers .",
    "today we have unprecedented opportunities to _ connect _ these communities to the language resources they need .",
    "we can observe that the individuals who use and create language resources are looking for three things : data , tools , and advice . by _",
    "data _ we mean any information that documents or describes a language , such as a published monograph , a computer data file , or even a shoebox full of hand - written index cards .",
    "the information could range in content from unanalyzed sound recordings to fully transcribed and annotated texts to a complete descriptive grammar . by _",
    "tools _ we mean computational resources that facilitate creating , viewing , querying , or otherwise using language data .",
    "tools include not just software programs , but also the digital resources that the programs depend on , such as fonts , stylesheets , and document type definitions . by _ advice _",
    "we mean any information about what data sources are reliable , what tools are appropriate in a given situation , what practices to follow when creating new data , and so forth ( e.g. the corpora list archives ) . in the context of , the term _ language resource _ is broadly construed to include all three of these : data , tools and advice .",
    "unfortunately , today s user does not have ready access to the resources that are needed .",
    "figure  [ fig : vision2 ] offers a diagrammatic view of this reality . some archives ( e.g. archive 1 ) do have a site on the internet which the user is able to find , so the resources of that archive are accessible .",
    "other archives ( e.g. archive 2 ) are on the internet , so the user could access them in theory , but the user has no idea they exist so they are not accessible in practice . still other archives ( e.g. archive 3 ) are not even on the internet . and there are potentially hundreds of archives ( e.g. archive @xmath0 ) that the user needs to know about .",
    "tools and advice are out there as well , but are at many different sites .",
    "there are many other problems inherent in the current situation .",
    "for instance , the user may not be able to find all the existing data about a language of interest because different sites have called it by different names ( low _ recall _ ) .",
    "the user may be swamped with irrelevant resources because search terms have important meanings in other domains ( low _ precision _ ) .",
    "the user may not be able to use an accessible data file for lack of being able to match it with the right tools .",
    "the user may locate advice that seems relevant but have no basis for judging its merits .",
    "as web - indexing technologies improve one might hope that a general - purpose search engine should be sufficient to bridge the gap between people and the resources they need .",
    "however this is a vain hope .",
    "first , many language resources , such as audio files and software , are not text - based .",
    "second , many language names have several variants , and these various strings regularly denote things other than languages .",
    "third , much of the material is not  and will never be  documented in free prose on the web . in place of traditional web - indexing , two new initiatives provide the necessary infrastructure for language resource discovery .",
    "the dublin core metadata initiative began in 1995 to develop conventions for resource discovery on the web .",
    "the dublin core metadata elements represent a broad , interdisciplinary consensus about the core set of elements that are likely to be widely useful to support resource discovery .",
    "the dublin core consists of 15 metadata elements , where each element is optional and repeatable : and .",
    "this set can be used to describe resources that exist in digital or traditional formats .",
    "the open archives initiative ( ) was launched in october 1999 to provide a common framework across electronic preprint archives , and it has since been broadened to include digital repositories of scholarly materials regardless of their type . to implement the  infrastructure ,",
    "an archive must comply with two standards : the _  shared metadata set _",
    "( dublin core ) , which facilitates interoperability across all repositories participating in the , and the _  metadata harvesting protocol _ , which allows software services to query a repository using http requests .",
    "archives are called `` data providers , '' and typically have a submission procedure , a long - term storage system , and a mechanism permitting users to obtain materials from the archive .",
    "an  `` service provider '' provides end - user services  such as search functions over union catalogs  based on metadata harvested from one or more data providers .",
    "figure  [ fig : white - paper2 ] illustrates a single service provider accessing three data providers using the  metadata harvesting protocol .",
    "end - users only interact with service providers .",
    "the  infrastructure has the bottom - up , distributed character of the web , while simultaneously having the efficient , structured nature of a centralized database .",
    "this combination is well - suited to the language resource community , where the available data is growing rapidly and where a large user - base is fairly consistent in how it describes its resource needs .",
    "data providers may support metadata standards in addition to the dublin core .",
    "thus , a specialist community like the language resources community can define a metadata format tailored to its domain . using the  infrastructure , the community s",
    "archives can be federated : a virtual meta - archive collects all the information into a single place and end - users can query multiple archives simultaneously . in the case of , the linguistic data consortium has harvested the catalogs of ten participating archives and created a search interface which permits queries over all 9,000 + records .",
    "a single search typically returns records from multiple archives .",
    "the prototype can be accessed via .",
    "the  metadata set extends the dublin core set only to the minimum degree required to express those basic properties of language resources which are useful as finding aids .",
    "all fifteen dublin core elements are used in the  metadata set . in order to suit the specific needs of the language resources community ,",
    "the elements have been `` qualified '' following principles articulated in `` dublin core qualifiers '' @xcite , and explained below .",
    "this section lists the  metadata elements and controlled vocabularies .",
    "full details are available from .",
    "three attributes  , , and  are used throughout the metadata set to handle most qualifications to dublin core .",
    "some elements in the  metadata set use the attribute to identify element refinements .",
    "these qualifiers make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific .",
    "a refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element , but with a more restricted scope @xcite .    some elements in the  metadata set use the attribute to hold metadata values that are taken from a specific encoding scheme .",
    "when an element may take this attribute , the attribute value specifies a precise value for the element taken from a controlled vocabulary or formal notation (  [ sec : cv ] ) . in such cases , the element content",
    "may also be used to specify a free - form elaboration of the coded value .    every element in the  metadata set",
    "may use the attribute .",
    "it specifies the language in which the text in the content of the element is written .",
    "the value for the attribute comes from a controlled vocabulary olac - language . by default",
    ", the attribute has the value `` en '' , for english .",
    "whenever the language of the element content is other than english , the attribute should be used to identify the language . by using multiple instances of the metadata elements tagged for different languages",
    ", data providers may offer their metadata records in multiple languages .",
    "service providers may use this information in order to offer multilingual views of the metadata .      in this section",

    "language identification is probably the most fundamental kind of information that can be given to any language resource @xcite .",
    "the most comprehensive knowledge base for language identification is the ethnologue @xcite , an online searchable database which has been built up over fifty years .",
    "the ethnologue database contains several types of information for each language : a unique three - letter code , the country where this language is spoken , alternative names , dialects , language classification , comments , and references to the sil bibliography .",
    "this section discusses a variety of issues relating to language identification and to the specification of the languages covered by multilingual resources .",
    "we believe these are two key issues for the asian language resources community .      in order to identify and catalog a language it is crucial to define what counts as a language and to distinguish languages from dialects .",
    "the editors of the ethnologue have made thousands of such decisions using advice from hundreds of experts around the world .",
    "however , for many languages scholarship remains patchy or else there is scholarly disagreement . in such cases ,",
    "the best that the ethnologue can do is what it does already  represent incomplete knowledge and then produce periodic updates to reflect the results of new research .",
    "as  grows , ethnologue codes will be deployed widely .",
    "each new -conformant archive will be faced with a range of issues in seeking to associate language codes with language resources . for concreteness",
    ", we have chosen for our examples the formosan languages , a group of austronesian languages spoken in taiwan .",
    "we put ourselves in the shoes of the field research group at academia sinica ( elizabeth zeitoun , personal communication ) and try to envisage the problems which they might encounter in assigning ethnologue codes to their language resources .",
    "we see three broad categories of problem : over - splitting , over - chunking and omission . over - splitting",
    "occurs when a language variety is treated as a distinct language .",
    "for example , nataoran is given its own language code ( ais ) even though the scholars at academia sinica consider it to be a dialect of amis ( alv ) .",
    "over - chunking occurs when two distinct languages are treated as dialects of a single language ( there does not appear to be an example of this in the ethnologue s treatment of formosan languages ) .",
    "omission occurs when a language is not listed .",
    "for example , two extinct languages , luilang and quaquat , are not listed in the ethnologue .",
    "another kind of omission problem occurs when the language is actually listed , but the name by which the archivist knows it is not listed , whether as a primary name or an alternate name . in such a case",
    "the archivist can not make the match to assign the proper code .",
    "for instance , the language listed as taroko ( trv ) in the ethnologue is known as seediq by the academia sinica ; several of the alternate names listed by the ethnologue are similar , but none matches exactly .",
    "beyond these three problems with language identification , a further type of problem concerns scholarly disagreement over language family classification .",
    "the ethnologue follows the oxford international encyclopedia of linguistics @xcite for most language families . for the austronesian languages , including the formosan languages",
    ", the ethnologue follows the comparative austronesian dictionary @xcite .",
    "additionally , some changes have been entered in the light of more recent comparative studies .",
    "academia sinica has developed its own language family classification scheme for formosan languages , and this differs from the ethnologue / tryon scheme .",
    "additionally , languages typically have many variant names , and scholars may disagree on the choice of a canonical name for the language .",
    "for example , the academia sinica scholars believe taroko to be a variant of seediq , while the ethnologue / tryon would presumably consider seediq to be a variant of taroko .",
    "the consequences of these problems for classification and retrieval are obvious . in the case of over - splitting , as with ais and alv mentioned above , someone searching for amis resources will need to know to search over both codes . an archivist cataloging a resource which is ambiguous with respect to the ais / alv distinction ( perhaps because it was created by someone who did not believe in the distinction ) may need to assign both codes . in the case of over - chunking , an archivist can not specify the individual language but must use a code which designates two or more languages . someone searching for resources in one of those languages will experience lower precision . in the case of omission",
    ", no language code can be assigned , and classification and search must fall back to using conventional string representations for language names ( with the attendant precision and recall problems ) . in the case of differing language family classifications , the precision and recall of searches on language family names are reduced .",
    "all of these problems can be addressed through existing ethnologue mechanisms . however ,  metadata and service providers could offer complementary remedies .    * controlling element content . *",
    "the and elements permit the language code to be specified in the attribute , while the element content is unrestricted .",
    "a community of formosan scholars could develop a controlled vocabulary for identifying speech varieties down to any level of detail they liked , and then use those terms as the content of the or element .",
    "for example , the following are five varieties of the bunun language :    .... < language code=\"x - sil - bnn\" > northern / takituduh</ > < language code=\"x - sil - bnn\" > northern / takibakha</ > < language code=\"x - sil - bnn\" > central / takbanuaz</ > < language code=\"x - sil - bnn\" > central / takivatan</ > <",
    "language code=\"x - sil - bnn\" > southern / isbukun</ > ....    if no ethnologue code corresponded to the group of languages in question , as in the amis / nataoran case , the code attribute could be omitted ( though this would prevent recall on the ethnologue code ) .",
    "this general approach could be formalized by permitting subcommunities to register an encoding scheme as a controlled vocabulary with a unique name .",
    "that name would be specified as the value of a new attribute , and the element content would be constrained to be an item from the corresponding vocabulary .",
    "these approaches would address the problems of over - chunking and omission .",
    "* registering language groups with an olac registration service .",
    "* while the classification of a language is sometimes treated as metadata for resources in that language , we believe that a more appropriate location for this type of finding aid is in  service providers .  could maintain a language classification server which would house a comprehensive list of language family names and their extensional definitions ( i.e. sets of ethnologue codes )",
    ". the server would permit users to define their own language group names or their own versions of existing group names .",
    "for instance , academia sinica could register a language group name with the extension \\ { , } .",
    "searching on their notion of `` amis '' would return resources classified under both codes .",
    "entire classification schemes with complex hierarchies could be represented in this fashion .",
    "service providers could index their harvested metadata using these names , allowing any user to perform searches using any classification scheme . over time",
    ", the more respected and popular classifications could be identified and accorded due prominence .",
    "this mechanism would address the problems of over - splitting and differing classification .",
    "for many language resources it is necessary to identify more than one language . in some cases , such as mt systems and bilingual lexicons",
    ", there is an added complication , namely _ directionality_. someone looking for such a resource will usually want to specify source and/or target languages .",
    "for example , in searching for a korean - to - english resource , the user would not usually be interested in discovering english - to - korean resources .",
    "thus , there is an _ a priori _ need for resources to be described using _ ordered pairs _ of languages .",
    "provides some mechanisms which can be applied to these cases .",
    "first ,  metadata elements are repeatable , e.g.  a system which can process multiple languages will be described using multiple elements , one per language .",
    "second ,  incorporates directionality in its distinction between and .",
    "are these simple mechanisms adequate for the convenient and accurate description and discovery of multilingual resources ? in this section",
    "we enumerate the main types of multilingual resource and show how  metadata can be used to classify them .",
    "we report some problems and discuss possible solutions .",
    "the simplest type of mt system is a unidirectional system which translates language @xmath1 to language @xmath2 . here",
    ", the intended audience of such a system is assumed to be the speakers of language @xmath2 who use the system to access documents in another language @xmath1 .",
    "the  solution would be to designate @xmath1 as the and @xmath2 as the .",
    "note that `` audience '' is slightly problematic .",
    "such an mt system may be intended for an audience of @xmath1 speakers who wish to translate their documents into language @xmath2 .",
    "the problem here is not with directionality but with the notion of `` audience '' in the  definition of .",
    "the definition could be adjusted to remove this problem .",
    "next in order of complexity is the bidirectional case , where a system translates in both directions between languages @xmath3 and @xmath4 . extending the previous solution",
    ", we would designate both @xmath3 and @xmath4 as and . ideally , we would use order or structure to group the languages appropriately :     + ` < pair><subject.language",
    "code= ` _ `  x`_`/ > ` + `  < language  code= ` _ `",
    "y`_`/></pair > ` + ` < pair><subject.language  code= ` _ `  y`_`/ > ` + `  < language  code= ` _",
    "`  x`_`/></pair > `    however ,  metadata is flat and unordered .",
    "the only available options are permutations of the following , in which we can make no contrastive use of order .",
    "+ ` < language  code= ` _ `  x`_`/ > ` + ` < language  code= ` _ `  y`_`/ > ` + ` < subject.language",
    "code= ` _ `  x`_`/ > ` + ` < subject.language  code= ` _ `  y`_`/ > `    although this loses information , we do not believe it presents a problem for typical kinds of retrieval .",
    "queries for an mt system ( i ) from @xmath3 ; ( ii ) from @xmath4 ; ( iii ) to @xmath3 ; ( iv ) to @xmath4 ; ( v ) from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ; or ( vi ) from @xmath4 to @xmath3 , will discover the system described above .",
    "next are mt systems which translate from one language into many , or from many languages into one ( star configurations ) . here",
    "the obvious approach is adequate :     + _ `",
    "one - to - many : ` _ + ` < subject.language  code= ` _ `  s`_`/ > ` + ` < language  code= ` _ `",
    "t1`_`/ > ` + ` < language  code= ` _ `",
    "t2`_`/ > ` + ` < language  code= ` _ `  t3`_`/ > ` +   + _ `  many - to - one : ` _ + ` < subject.language  code= ` _ `  s1`_`/ > ` + ` < subject.language  code= ` _ `  s2`_`/ > ` + ` < subject.language  code= ` _",
    "`  s3`_`/ > ` + ` < language  code= ` _ `  t`_`/ > `    finally , there are mt systems which translate _ from _ and _ to _ all languages in a set of @xmath0 languages . here",
    "again the obvious approach is adequate , and is clearly superior to a solution where all ordered pairs are enumerated .     + `",
    "< subject.language  code= ` _ `  x`_`/ > ` + ` < subject.language  code= ` _ `  y`_`/ > ` + ` < subject.language  code= `",
    "_ `  z`_`/ > ` + ` < language  code= ` _ `  x`_`/ > ` + ` < language  code= ` _ `  y`_`/ > ` + ` < language  code= ` _ `",
    "z`_`/ > `      a unidirectional bilingual lexicon with lemmas in language @xmath1 and definitions in language @xmath2 is described like a unidirectional mt system .",
    "the  solution is to designate @xmath1 as the and @xmath2 as the . a fully bidirectional lexicon intended for use by speakers of either language",
    "would be described in the same fashion as a bidirectional mt system :     + ` < language  code= ` _ `  x`_`/ > ` + ` < language  code= ` _ `  y`_`/ > ` + ` <",
    "subject.language  code= ` _ `  x`_`/ > ` + ` < subject.language  code= ` _ `  y`_`/ > `    as before , this solution has lost some structure , but retrieval behavior is correct nonetheless . of course , this metadata could equally be the collection - level metadata for a set of two monolingual dictionaries , one in language @xmath3 and one in language @xmath4 . however , the element would distinguish these cases by having different vocabulary items for monolingual and bilingual lexicons .",
    "multilingual lexicons may also exhibit star configurations : one - to - many ( lexicons with definitions in multiple languages ) ; or many - to - one ( comparative wordlists ) . here",
    "the treatment is analogous to the corresponding mt systems discussed above .",
    "finally , multilingual lexicons may map between all pairs of a set of languages , as in the case of some termbanks . in this case , all the languages are designated both using and .      the most simple case of a text collection is a set of texts in a single language .",
    "usually , the language in these texts would be described using the element . however , in the situation where the text collection is intended to document a language , then it is simultaneously _ in _ and _ about _ that language .",
    "accordingly , it would be tempting to describe this with both the and elements .",
    "rather than let the decision about metadata depend on the intent of the creator of the resource ( which may not be known ) , or on the typical usage of the resource ( which may change through time ) , we think it would be simplest to describe such situations using the element only .",
    "this approach generalizes to the case of a text collection spanning multiple languages ( e.g. where each text comes from one of the formosan languages ) . here",
    ", collection - level metadata would provide a element for each language represented in the collection .    in the case of bilingual aligned texts ( bitexts )",
    "there is normally a directionality , since one of the texts is primary and the other is a translation . here",
    ", we specify the primary language using , and the translation using .    a complication arises when the texts or bitexts employ analytical notations . for a text in language @xmath3 transcribed in a notation ( such as the international phonetic alphabet )",
    "which is inaccessible to speakers of @xmath3 ( assuming any exist ) , it would make sense to use instead of .",
    "the situation becomes more vexing for texts with embedded annotations ( such as the notation of conversation analysis ) , where non - specialists could discard the annotations to get a conventional text . here , the use of both and seems to be indicated .",
    "the final category we consider is linguistic descriptions , such as field notes and grammars . in the usual case ,",
    "the language described is specified with while the language of the commentary is specified with .",
    "one interesting case is where a third language is used for elicitation .",
    "for example , a sentence from amis may have been elicited using a sentence from chinese , and both sentences may have been entered in the field notes .",
    "next , commentary in the language of the linguist , such as english , may have been added . in this case",
    ", we would say that the field notes include bitext , and the languages of the bitext would be described in the usual way .",
    "the audience language of the field notes would also be specified . using s flat metadata",
    ", we would specify the languages as follows :     + ` < subject.language  code=````x - sil - ais`''`/ > ` + ` < language  code=````x - sil - cfr`''`/ > ` + ` < language  code=````x - sil - eng`''`/ > `    we believe this is perfectly adequate for the majority of retrieval purposes .",
    "if it were necessary to represent the structure more accurately , _ two _  records could be associated with the same resource , one describing the field notes as a whole ( with the above language designations ) , and one describing the bitext content ( with just the ais and cfr designations ) .",
    "the different linguistic types would be expressed using the element , and the two records could refer to each other using the element :     + ` < relation  refine=````ispartof ` '' ` > ` _ `  id1`_`</relation > ` + ` < relation  refine=````haspart ` '' ` > ` _ `  id2`_`</relation > `",
    "this paper has presented the leading ideas of the open language archives community ( ) , along with its metadata set and controlled vocabularies .",
    "language resources exhibit great diversity , and include all types of data , tools and advice .",
    "as collections of language resources proliferate ,  will make it maximally easy for members of the language resources community to discover each other s resources .",
