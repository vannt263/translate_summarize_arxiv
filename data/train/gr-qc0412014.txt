    "while in four - dimensional spacetimes black holes are stable , it has been shown by gregory and laflamme@xcite that at least some of their higher dimensional analogs , in particular black strings , are _ linearly _ unstable . as opposed to the situation in four - dimensions ,",
    "at the linear level perturbations of these black strings grow exponentially above some critical length of the string .",
    "although this picture has been well understood through a variety of analysis @xcite , it is not yet known what an unstable black string evolves to . in @xcite , using the linear instability of the string coupled to entropy considerations , it was argued that an unstable black string would `` pinch off '' and form a set of black holes which would later merge .",
    "this scenario , at the classical level , must give rise to a violation of cosmic censorship .",
    "however , this possibility was made doubtful by more recent work of horowitz and maeda ( hm )  @xcite . there , a theorem is proved using the properties of expansion , shear and affine parameter of the geodesic generators of the black string horizon .",
    "this theorem asserts that a pinch off in finite affine parameter could only occur if a singularity formed outside the horizon . under the assumption that this , perhaps too drastic scenario , is unlikely , the only other option left open for the event horizon pinching - off",
    "is that it does so in _ infinite affine parameter_. this possibility , although mathematically possible , was argued against by hm .",
    "their argument is based on one main observation together with a plausibility argument .",
    "the observation is that although their theorem does indeed allow for a pinch - off in infinite time , the rate , with respect to affine parameter , at which circles at @xmath0 can decrease in size is extremely slow .",
    "hm then argue that if the system decays so slowly , its dynamics must go through a series of essentially static non - uniform strings , and it then might just stay at one of these solutions .",
    "therefore , instead of the pinch - off scenario , hm conjectured that the black string would evolve into a black string that is static but not uniform in the @xmath1 direction : a static wiggly black string .",
    "families of static wiggly black strings were found numerically by wiseman  @xcite , however , all the solutions of @xcite had too large a mass to be the endpoint of the evolution of the unstable black string as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "note however the recent work by sorkin @xcite ( and related discussions in @xcite ) where it is discussed how for large enough spherical dimensions the static solutions found do indeed have lower mass , and could in principle be those conjectured by @xcite .    in an attempt to resolve the issue of the fate of the linearly unstable black string , in @xcite a numerical discretization of the einstein equations in five - dimensions",
    "was presented .",
    "an so(3 ) symmetry was assumed , effectively making the problem 2 + 1 dimensional , and hence one that could be solved on contemporary computer systems .",
    "this code was employed to study the evolution of slight perturbations of a static , uniform black string .",
    "the simulation tracked the behavior of the system well into the non - linear regime , though unfortunately it could not be extended far enough to elucidate the final fate of the string .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical solution revealed significant and rich dynamics , illustrating , in particular , that the string evolves toward a shape resembling large spherical black holes connected by thin strings . in terms of areal radius ,",
    "the ratio of the maximum to minimum radius was about @xmath2 by the end of the simulation .    in this paper , we re -",
    "examine the data of @xcite , paying closer attention to the analysis of @xcite and examine relevant features of the solution .",
    "in particular , we numerically find the expansion , shear and affine parameter of the black string horizon and discuss their behavior in connection to the conjecture of @xcite where a scenario is ruled out as improbable , though as we argue here , it might very well be possible .",
    "the methods used are presented in section ii , results in section iii and conclusions in section iv .",
    "our starting point is to consider a spacetime described by the metric provided by the numerical simulation of @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we adopt the same gauge conditions used there ( to avoid performing a numerical coordinate transformation , which in general would involve interpolating functions in space and time ) .",
    "the metric used in @xcite takes the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the unit two - sphere metric .",
    "our goal is to extract intrinsic properties of the event horizon and its generators .",
    "the horizon can be described by a surface @xmath6 . to extract the sought - after information ,",
    "the first step is to find the geodesic generators of the horizon .",
    "to this end , we construct the vector @xmath7 normal to the horizon defined as @xmath8 . here",
    "an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath9 and a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath1 . since @xmath10 is null , it is tangent to the generators of the horizon ; these are given by @xmath11 note however that these geodesics are not affinely parameterized . to obtain the affinely parameterized geodesics one can exploit the fact that their tangent vectors @xmath12 obey the simple relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "is given by @xmath17 thus , the affine parameter @xmath18 of these geodesics is found by integrating @xmath19 next we turn our attention to obtaining the expansion and shear of these affinely parametrized generators .",
    "since the spacetime is spherically symmetric , these quantities are given by just two components of @xmath20 : let @xmath21 be a unit vector in the two - sphere direction and let @xmath22 be a unit vector orthogonal to @xmath10 and to the two - sphere directions . define the quantities @xmath23 and @xmath24 by @xmath25 which measure the distortion along spherical and longitudinal directions respectively .",
    "then , the expansion and squared shear are given in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath24 by @xmath26 the equations above determine the affinely parametrized generators of the horizon and its expansion and shear . as we will see later , due to the exponential behavior of these quantities",
    ", it will turn out to be convenient to consider the logarithm of the affine parameter @xmath27 and rescaled quantities defined as follows @xmath28 it then follows that @xmath29 the quantity @xmath30 is found by @xmath31 to find @xmath32 we note that there is freedom to add a multiple of @xmath10 to @xmath22 and use that freedom to make @xmath33 vanish .",
    "it then follows that the components of @xmath22 are @xmath34 } ^{-1/2}}\\ ] ] and @xmath35 , from which @xmath36    finally , we point out the following observation which will be crucial in the numerical evaluations to be carried out later . as we have seen above , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( and their scaled counterparts ) can be calculated independently .",
    "however they are related by raychaudhuri s equation , which for the five - dimensional vacuum null case is @xmath39 while the corresponding equation for the rescaled quantities is @xmath40",
    "the simulations performed in @xcite provide a ( partial ) description of the spacetime describing a slightly perturbed black string that evolves to a state where the black string is quite deformed as judged by the apparent horizon .",
    "the surface that we use here as the event horizon is the boundary of the causal past of the region exterior to the apparent horizon at the latest time in the simulation ( calculated using a generalization of the technique described in @xcite ) , and it turns out that this surface is very well approximated by the apparent horizon for the entire length of the simulation .",
    "we initialize the affine parameter to @xmath41 ( hence @xmath42 ) at the beginning of the simulation . among all generators ,",
    "the one of particular interest is the one corresponding to the minimum radius , since it is there where any pinch off would occur . due to the reflection symmetry of the initial data , the set of points on the horizon that at each time correspond to the minimal radius form a geodesic generator , and that generator stays at constant @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows plots of @xmath43 as a function of the simulation time coordinate @xmath9 for the generator of minimum radius , from simulations with three different resolutions ( to give some measure of the error in the results ) . note that @xmath43 has reached @xmath44 near the end of the simulation .",
    "this corresponds to an affine parameter of about @xmath45 .",
    "thus , though the simulation has only taken a moderate amount of simulation time , it has gone for an enormous amount of affine parameter .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows plots of @xmath46 and @xmath47 vs @xmath43 for the generator of minimum radius .",
    "note that due to the rescaling this means that by the end of the simulation , the unrescaled expansion @xmath37 and shear @xmath48 are of order @xmath49 .",
    "note too , that though the behavior of @xmath46 and @xmath47 as a function of @xmath43 is quite dynamic throughout the simulation , since @xmath50 it follows that viewed as functions of @xmath18 even the rescaled expansion and shear would be regarded as slowly varying .",
    "we now turn to the behavior of the rescaled quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we can calculate the shear by simply evaluating ( [ sigmatilde ] ) along the generator of minimum radius : figure [ fig3 ] shows the result of this as a function of @xmath43 for the three simulations . in principle",
    "we can also calculate @xmath51 in a similar manner using ( [ thetatilde ] ) , which says @xmath51 is the _ difference _ between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . however , the problem with this is that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are very close to one another in magnitude , as can be seen from figure [ fig2 ] , and so the difference will be dominated by numerical error . in fact , from the plot of @xmath46 in figure [ fig2 ] , and the assumed second order convergence of the numerical scheme , one can estimate that the error in @xmath46 ( and similarly for @xmath47 ) , is on the order of @xmath53 at intermediate times ( near the minimum of @xmath46 ) and grows to as much as @xmath54 at late times .",
    "therefore at late times the difference @xmath55 will be completely swamped by numerical error .    in order to alleviate this problem ,",
    "we use raychaudhuri s equation to integrate @xmath56 . however , in the form of ( [ rayscale ] ) there is in general no stable direction of integration due to the linear and quadratic terms in @xmath56 ; in other words , numerical errors in @xmath56 could cause a blow - up integrating in either direction in @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , we eliminate the @xmath57 term using ( [ thetatilde ] ) , and @xmath58 using ( [ sigmatilde ] ) , though we keep the linear term in @xmath56 to give    @xmath59    in this form there is a stable direction of integration from large to small @xmath43 , and the only ` sources ' in @xmath30 and @xmath32 are quadratic and of the same sign , hence we are not as susceptible to numerical errors arising from the difference of similar numbers .",
    "one potential difficulty is in specifying initial conditions for the integration , which we need to do at the end of the simulation where @xmath56 obtained from ( [ thetatilde ] ) has the largest error .",
    "fortunately the integration seems to be fairly insensitive to the initial condition in @xmath56 , as illustrated in figure [ fig4 ] , where we show the results of integration of ( [ rayscale_b ] ) starting from both @xmath56 calculated using ( [ thetatilde ] ) , and @xmath60 ( which is within the numerical margin of error at late times ) .",
    "@xmath43 vs @xmath9 for the horizon generator of minimum radius , from three simulations of identical initial data though differing resolution ( the curves are labelled by @xmath61x@xmath62 , where @xmath61(@xmath62 ) is the number of grid points in the @xmath63(@xmath1 ) direction ) .",
    "we show results from three different resolutions to demonstrate that we are in the convergent regime .",

    "we have found the behavior of the horizon of a black string in terms of the affine parameter , expansion and shear of the generators .",
    "the most significant aspects of our results are the extremely large values of the affine parameter , and correspondingly the extremely small values of the ( unrescaled ) expansion and shear . in hindsight , this result is not too surprising as it is well known that for a schwarzschild black hole there is an exponential relation between the killing time coordinate and the affine parameter of the horizon generators .",
    "since the straight black string is just the schwarzschild spacetime crossed with a circle , and since the spacetime treated here is initially just a small perturbation of the straight string , it appears natural that very large values of the affine parameter are reached .",
    "the immediate conclusion is that in some sense the logarithm of the affine parameter is a more natural `` dynamical time '' than the affine parameter .",
    "what do our results say about the final fate of the unstable black string ?",
    "they certainly do not yet resolve the issue .",
    "the same three possible alternatives are still there : the string can ( i ) evolve to a static wiggly string , ( ii ) pinch off in finite affine parameter or ( iii ) pinch off in infinite affine parameter .",
    "it is clear both from @xcite and from our work that the simulation has not gone far enough to read off the asymptotic behavior of the string .",
    "for that , a more robust simulation is needed .",
    "however , our work does shed extra light on the status of the alternatives , in particular that of alternative ( iii ) . recall that in @xcite it was correctly pointed out that alternative ( iii ) requires very small ( unrescaled ) expansion and shear and very slow dependence on affine parameter .",
    "our results here show that precisely this is the sort of behavior that occurs , at least in some regime of the evolution of the black string . moreover , this behavior is still in a regime of non - trivial dynamics .",
    "in fact , one might argue that alternative ( iii ) is the most plausible for lower spherical dimensions of the spacetime _ if the only non - uniform static solutions are those found in @xcite_. this fact would make alternative ( i ) unlikely as these solutions are too massive for spacetimes with dimension lower than 13 . additionally , option ( ii ) requires a singularity forming outside the horizon , and no hints of such behavior developing were seen in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "note that under alternative ( iii ) one might still have different scenarios .",
    "for instance , the ` minimal ' circle might continue to shrink slowly with the trend observed at the late stages of the simulations of @xcite .",
    "this requires the neighborhood of the string not to be describable as a linearly perturbed uniform string since the ratio of length / area is above the critical length . on the other hand , if this is indeed the case , then the string may pinch off through a cascading sequence of instabilities on ever smaller scales , which again could happen in finite asymptotic time though _ infinite affine time_.    in a more quantitative vein , we can consider the possible asymptotic behavior of the ( rescaled ) expansion and shear .",
    "let @xmath68 and @xmath69 be positive constants .",
    "then it is consistent with equation ( [ rayscale ] ) for both @xmath56 and @xmath58 to asymptotically approach @xmath70 .",
    "this would result from both @xmath30 and @xmath32 approaching @xmath71 asymptotically , but their difference approaching @xmath70 .",
    "that this sort of behavior is possible was recognized in @xcite but there it was thought that such behavior was somehow unnaturally slow and indicative of an approximately static solution . if @xmath72 then this behavior results in pinch off in infinite affine parameter .",
    "if in addition , @xmath73 then this pinch off occurs with finite @xmath74 as assumed in @xcite .",
    "if such a power law is the asymptotic behavior of the unstable black string , then the simulations have not yet run for long enough to be sufficiently far into the asymptotic regime to try to calculate the exponents .",
    "nonetheless , in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath56 peak and then decrease .",
    "this decrease may be the beginning of a power law tail to be found in an improved black string simulation .",
