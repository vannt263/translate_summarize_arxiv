    "in photoproduction at hera a quasi real photon , emitted from the incoming positron , collides with the incoming proton . in leading order quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ,",
    "two processes contribute to the photoproduction of jets : the direct process , in which the photon couples directly to a parton in the proton , and the resolved process , in which the photon acts as a source of partons , one of which scatters from a parton in the proton . beyond the leading order in qcd , direct and resolved processes are not distinctly separable .",
    "the cross section for jet photoproduction is sensitive to the partonic structures of both the proton and the photon . in the kinematic regime of the measurement presented in this paper , the fractional momentum @xmath78 at which partons inside the proton are probed lies predominantly in the region between @xmath79 and @xmath80 . at these @xmath78 values the parton densities in the proton",

    "are not strongly constrained by @xmath84 data obtained from @xmath85 scattering at @xmath86 experiments  @xcite .",
    "the investigation presented in this paper aims to constrain more tightly the parton densities in the photon at high @xmath82 , where the contribution from quarks dominates , by exploiting their influence on the dijet photoproduction cross section . for this purpose",
    "the dijet cross section is measured in a kinematic regime where next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations are expected to describe the data .",
    "it should be noted here that jet measurements at the tevatron  @xcite , although generally in good agreement with nlo - qcd , show discrepancies in the comparison of the 630  gev and 1800  gev data sets . these may be connected to non - perturbative effects , such as a possible underlying event  @xcite .",
    "a number of these effects , which may also be of relevance to the present study , have been investigated in this paper .",
    "this paper builds on the improved understanding of jet photoproduction and of comparisons to nlo - qcd calculations gained in previous analyses  @xcite  -  @xcite and on a significant theoretical effort in the recent past  @xcite  -  @xcite .",

    "a previous jet photoproduction analysis  @xcite has shown that for jets with transverse energy greater than @xmath87  gev , the dijet cross section agrees with nlo - qcd predictions , within the experimental uncertainties of that analysis .",
    "the data used in this paper were collected in 1995 with the zeus detector at hera , colliding positrons at an energy of @xmath88  gev with protons at an energy of @xmath89  gev , yielding a total cm energy of @xmath90  gev .",

    "symmetrisation of the cross section with respect to the pseudorapidity of the two highest - transverse - energy jets has been claimed to remove infrared instabilities in the nlo - qcd calculations  @xcite .",

    "* jets are defined using the longitudinally invariant @xmath2-clustering algorithm  @xcite in the inclusive mode  @xcite , where the parameter @xmath117 is chosen equal to 1 .",
    "this algorithm provides a jet reconstruction that is suitable for comparisons between data and theory  @xcite .",
    "the dijet photoproduction cross section presented in this paper refers to events in which at least two jets , as defined by the @xmath2-clustering algorithm , are found in the hadronic final state .",
    "these jets are required to have pseudorapidities between @xmath118 and @xmath119 , transverse energy of the highest - transverse - energy jet , @xmath120 , greater than 14 gev and the transverse energy of the second - highest - transverse - energy jet , @xmath121 , greater than 11 gev .",

    "the measured cross sections are compared to nlo - qcd calculations by four different groups : p. aurenche et al .",

    "for the parton densities in the photon three parameterisations are used , grv - ho  @xcite , gs96-ho  @xcite and afg - ho  @xcite .    in all calculations",
    "the renormalisation and factorisation scales are chosen equal to the transverse energy of the highest - transverse - energy jet .",
    "the variation in the nlo - qcd calculations of the presented cross section has been found to be less than @xmath134 , when the scales are varied between half and twice this value .",
    "the nlo - qcd calculations do not include fragmentation .",
    "jets are defined on the basis of the outgoing partons .",
    "while the momenta of jets at high transverse energies are expected to correspond closely to the momenta of the partons produced in the hard subprocess , the measured jet cross sections are affected at some level by the fragmentation . in a study using the herwig 5.9 and the pythia 5.7 monte carlo photoproduction models , the dijet cross section for jets of hadrons",
    "was compared to that for partons produced in the two - to - two hard subprocess and in the parton showers which were grouped into `` parton jets '' using the @xmath2-clustering algorithm .    in herwig the change in the cross section due to the fragmentation was found to be less than @xmath135 in most of the present kinematic region .",
    "however for events in which one jet has @xmath136 the cross section is reduced by more than @xmath135 due to fragmentation and when both jets have @xmath136 the cross section is reduced by @xmath137 . in pythia",
    "the reduction of the cross section due to fragmentation is much smaller , but shows the same trend . in a related study , presented in reference  @xcite ,",
    "herwig 5.9 was used to compare the cross section for jets of hadrons to that for jets of partons , produced in the two - to - two hard subprocess . the relative difference between these cross sections",
    "was found to be less than 20% , except again for events with backward jets where the reduction of the cross section due to fragmentation exceeds @xmath138 and is again largest ( @xmath139 ) when both jets have @xmath136 .",
    "since the effect of fragmentation on the cross section depends on the monte carlo model , no attempt was made to correct the data for these effects .",
    "instead , the effect of fragmentation is considered as a theoretical uncertainty .",
    "kinematic variables are reconstructed using a combination of track and calorimeter information that optimises the resolution of reconstructed kinematic variables  @xcite . the selected calorimeter clusters and tracks",
    "are referred to as energy flow objects ( efos ) .",
    "the use of track information reduces the sensitivity to energy losses in inactive material in front of the cal .",
    "however , the energy of particles for which no track information is available ( e.g. because the energy is deposited by a neutral particle ) , must be measured using cal information .",
    "these energies have to be corrected for the energy losses in the inactive material .",
    "the conservation of energy and momentum in neutral - current deep inelastic scattering events is exploited to determine the required energy corrections  @xcite by balancing the scattered positron with the hadronic final state .",
    "this is done for data and monte carlo event samples independently .",
    "the efos thus corrected are used both for the reconstruction of jets and to determine kinematic variables .",
    "comparisons between data and monte carlo of kinematic variables , reconstructed using corrected efos , lead to the assignment of a 3% correlated systematic uncertainty and a 2% uncorrelated systematic uncertainty in the transverse jet energies and in the hadronic variables  @xcite .",
    "after applying the energy corrections described in section [ kinvar ] , dijet events are selected from those events triggered by the dijet trigger  @xcite using the following procedures and cuts designed to remove sources of background :    * the @xmath2-clustering algorithm , in the inclusive mode with @xmath140 , is applied to the corrected efos .",

    "the rejection of neutral - current deep inelastic scattering ( nc - dis ) events is based on the variable @xmath111 .",
    "if a scattered positron candidate with energy greater than @xmath148  gev is found in the calorimeter , @xmath111 can be calculated from the energy @xmath149 and the polar angle @xmath150 of this positron candidate using the formula : @xmath151 .",
    "these events are rejected when : @xmath152 the variable @xmath111 can also be reconstructed from the observed hadronic final state using the jacquet - blondel formula  @xcite : @xmath153 , where the sum runs over all corrected efos . for all events",
    "it is required that @xmath154 this cut removes unidentified nc - dis events , for which @xmath155 peaks at 1 , and proton beam - gas interactions , which mostly have low @xmath155 values .",
    "the cuts on @xmath156 and @xmath155 effectively restrict the range of the virtuality of the exchanged photon to @xmath122  gev@xmath123 , with a median of about @xmath157  gev@xmath123 .    after the application of the described selection criteria , a sample of 8690 events remain . the contamination of this sample due to background processes was found to be negligible .",
    "photoproduction events , generated using monte carlo programs , are used for the determination of acceptance and migration corrections and for the study of systematic uncertainties .",
    "these events are passed through a full simulation of the zeus detector and undergo the same energy - correction procedure as the data .",
    "two leading - order monte carlo programs were used to generate dijet photoproduction events , herwig 5.9  @xcite and pythia 5.7  @xcite .",
    "both models use leading - order matrix elements , but they differ in the treatment of parton showers , hadronisation and the virtuality spectrum of the exchanged photon .",
    "no additional process that would produce soft or hard underlying events is included in the simulations .",
    "direct and resolved event samples are generated separately .",
    "the parton density functions used to generate both monte carlo samples are cteq3-lo  @xcite for the proton and grv - lo  @xcite for the photon .",
    "as the monte carlo models do not include higher order matrix elements , they are not expected to describe the absolute normalisation of the cross section . to obtain the best agreement between data and monte carlo , the normalisation of the direct and resolved contributions is determined from a fit to the measured @xmath131 spectrum . as a result the direct contribution of the herwig monte carlo is scaled by a factor 1.83 and the resolved contribution by a factor 1.72 . for pythia the direct contribution is scaled by 1.28 and the resolved contribution by 1.27 .",
    "when these factors are applied , both monte carlo models are found to give a reasonable description of various distributions , such as the @xmath106 and @xmath104 spectra .    the @xmath131 spectrum for the selected sample of the 8690 dijet events is shown in fig .",

    "the shape of the peak at high @xmath131 is best described by the herwig monte carlo . given the agreement in this distribution and in distributions like the @xmath106 and @xmath104 spectra ( not shown here ) , the herwig monte carlo sample is used to determine acceptance and migration corrections and to study systematic uncertainties .    in fig .",
