    "using these , we can bound the probability of error for the las detector as @xmath197 since @xmath177 can be arbitrarily small , we can conclude from ( [ dlas_mlp3 ] ) that indeed as @xmath176 , the symbol vector error probability of the las detector converges to that of the ml detector .",
    "this proof can be adapted to show that apart from the symbol vector error probability , the bit error probability of the las detector also converges to that of the ml detector .",
    "the proof for the bit error probability convergence is along the same lines as ( [ dlas_mlp2 ] ) and ( [ dlas_mlp3 ] ) , except that instead of defining the error event as @xmath198 , we define error events for each bit . for example , for the @xmath57th bit , the error event is defined as @xmath199 .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] we show the simulated ber performance of the las detector for v - blast with 4-qam and mmse initial vector for increasing @xmath1 . since an analytical expression for ml performance in the large mimo system limit is not available and simulating the ml performance for large dimensions involves prohibitively high complexity , we plot the siso awgn performance as a lower bound for comparison . it can be seen that for increasing @xmath1 , the ber performance of the las detector approaches the siso awgn performance at high snrs .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the average snr required to achieve a ber of @xmath200 for increasing @xmath1 and 4-qam .",
    "it can be seen that , for large @xmath1 , the required snr gets increasingly closer to that required in siso awgn for increasing @xmath1 .",
    "a similar behavior can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for 16-qam as well . in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , we also see that there is an initial degradation in performance for increasing number of antennas ( for @xmath201 ) .",
    "this shows that the las detector is suboptimal for small systems with small number of antennas , and becomes optimal in the large system limit ( as proved in the previous section ) .",
    "las detector achieves close to large system limit performance in systems with large number of dimensions ( e.g. , hundreds of dimensions in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) . such large number of dimensions need not be realized in spatial dimension alone , as in v - blast . as shown in @xcite , exploiting time dimension in addition to space dimension , large non - orthogonal stbc mimo systems can render large dimensions with less number of transmit antennas that can be implemented in practice .",
    "a @xmath202 non - orthogonal stbc from cyclic division algebra @xcite with complex data symbols has 512 real dimensions ; with 64-qam and rate-3/4 turbo code , this stbc achieves a spectral efficiency of 72 bps / hz . in @xcite ,",
    "las algorithm has been shown to achieve near - capacity performance in @xmath202 stbc mimo systems even in the presence of spatial correlation and with estimated channel matrix .",
    "further , considering that ntt docomo has demonstrated a @xmath203 v - blast mimo system operating at 5 gbps at a spectral efficiency of 50 bps / hz at 10 km / hr mobile speeds @xcite , the availability of low - complexity large - mimo detection algorithms like the las algorithm analyzed in this correspondence can motivate the adoption of @xmath202 and @xmath204 mimo systems operating at spectral efficiencies in excess of 50 bps / hz in emerging wireless standards like ieee 802.11 vht and ieee 802.16/lte - a .",
    "we conclude with the following two remarks : @xmath158 the derivation of analytical ber expressions for the ml performance in the large mimo system limit for different signal sets is an open problem .",
    "since large mimo systems can be viable in practice due to the availability of low - complexity detectors like the las detector , analytical ber expressions for the ml performance in the large mimo system limit would be quite useful as a benchmark for comparing the performance of practical detectors in large - mimo systems .",
    "the statistical mechanics approach employed in @xcite for large cdma system ber analysis can be investigated for such an analysis . @xmath161 while we are able to prove the asymptotic convergence of las performance to ml performance for 4-qam here , our simulation results for higher order qam ( e.g. , 16-qam ; see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) show similar behavioral trend like that for 4-qam .",
    "consequently , we conjecture that such a convergence holds for general @xmath37-qam and an analytical proof to show this can be attempted as an extension to this work .",
    "we present the proof of lemma [ lem5 ] in this appendix .",
