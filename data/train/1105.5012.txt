    "this paper links themes evoked in two classic papers , one in mathematics @xcite and the other in physics @xcite .",
    "the first of these poses the question as to whether the spectral content of the radiation from a body can reveal its shape .",
    "the second shows that the use of negatively - refracting metamaterials in a plane slab can lead to a super - resolving perfect lens , also known as a superlens .",
    "we will consider a two - dimensional composite material , composed of polygonal inclusions made of a metamaterial ( by which we mean an artificial material with a dielectric contant which has a negative real part and a very small imaginary part ) and placed in a positive dielectric matrix material .",
    "we will show that , in the spirit of pendry , the metamaterial makes possible resolution of an important structural feature of the inclusions , irrespective of how much smaller than the wavelength they are .",
    "we will also show that , in the spirit of kac , this feature relates to the shape of the inclusion , being in fact the corner angle of the polygon , and that it is deduced from spectral measurements on the composite .",
    "the fact that a spectral feature could be determined by corner shape , independent of ( say ) the area fraction of inclusions , was first suggested by hetherington and thorpe  @xcite , on the basis of an elegant argument and numerical evidence for dilute composites .",
    "we will base our demonstration firstly on analytic results relating to the spectrum of the effective dielectric permittivity function @xmath0 of the composite material , and secondly on remarkably accurate numerical results for this spectrum obtained using a new technique .",
    "note here that we are using the word `` spectrum '' in two related , but slightly different senses . in the previous paragraph",
    ", its usage meant that the absorption of electromagnetic waves by the composite was being determined as a function of wavelength , ranging over an appropriately - wide band . in the first sentence of this paragraph we referred to the distribution of singularities of the function @xmath0 , giving the effective permittivity of a composite having a specified geometry as a function of the ratio @xmath1 of the permittivities of inclusions and matrix .",
    "the relation between these usages is that , as wavelength varies so does the ratio @xmath2 , so that measurements of ( say ) optical absorption by a composite over a suitable wavelength interval can reveal details of the singularities of the function @xmath3 .    the numerical results for the singularity spectrum of @xmath3 reveal that it has a continuous part which runs between upper and lower limits of @xmath2 which do not vary at all with the area fraction of the inclusions .",
    "it is complemented by a discrete spectrum of poles which does evolve with area fraction .",
    "this evolution is in fact necessary , since the continuous spectrum for touching square inclusions in a checkerboard arrangement occupies the entire negative real axis of @xmath2 , but for non - touching square inclusions is confined to the interval @xmath4 .",
    "the animations we give show how this transformation is achieved : the discrete spectrum becomes more and more dense as the touching configuration is approached , to supply the required spectral extension , as anticipated by one of the authors  @xcite .",
    "the results we give here are interesting in the insights they give into the connection between metamaterials and super - resolution .",
    "they are also important in furthering our understanding of the connection between inclusion shape , geometrical arrangement and spectral properties of the effective permittivity function .",
    "this connection helps in the design of structures having enhanced absorption over a wide wavelength range for applications in photothermal or photovoltaic captors @xcite , or offering strongly enhanced local fields for applications like sensing or nonlinear optical elements .    we give a brief overview in section  [ sec : over ] of some of the important properties of the function @xmath5 , including analytic results relating to the continuous part of the spectrum and some numerical investigations of both the discrete and continuous parts of the spectrum . in section  [ sec : numer ] , we describe the method which enables accurate calculation of the spectrum of @xmath0 , and give numerical results illustrating its convergence , even on the negative real axis of @xmath2 . in section  [ sec : anim ] , we discuss the animations which are given in the supplementary material to this paper , and the physical consequences of the behaviour they show .",
    "we give a discussion and concluding remarks in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we will now give a concise review of what is known about the properties of the effective dielectric permittivity function @xmath0 , for composites made of two materials with dielectric permittivities @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with the former corresponding to a disconnected inclusion phase and the latter to a continuous matrix phase .",
    "we assume the geometry has cubic symmetry ( in three dimensions ) or square symmetry ( in two dimensions ) so that @xmath0 is scalar valued , i.e. the effective dielectric tensor equals @xmath8 .",
    "this review builds on that given in perrins and mcphedran @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 for a given geometry is homogeneous of degree 1 in the variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 , so we can rescale to make @xmath0 a function of a single complex variable , the permittivity ratio @xmath1 : @xmath9 from now on we let @xmath0 be an abbreviated notation for the effective dielectric permittivity function @xmath10 and we let @xmath5 denote its scaled counterpart , the effective relative dielectric permittivity function , as defined via  ( [ eq1 ] ) .    to determine @xmath5 for a given geometry , we need to solve an electrostatic transport problem repeatedly for various @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , we need to solve laplace s equation for the potential @xmath11 on a periodic domain with a periodic electric field @xmath12 having a prescribed average value , and boundary conditions of continuity of @xmath11 and its normal flux @xmath13 at interfaces between materials . the theory of the function @xmath5 becomes particularly elegant when we deal with two - dimensional problems , in which @xmath14 becomes a function in the plane .",
    "we may then apply the apparatus of complex - variable theory to the calculation of @xmath11 , and thus to @xmath5 . for the case of a doubly - periodic array of inclusions @xmath15 with unit cell @xmath16 , and square symmetry ,",
    "the effective permittivity may be defined as  @xcite @xmath17 where the integral in the numerator includes contributions @xmath18 from the inclusion region and @xmath19 from the matrix region . except for occasional comments on effective permittivity in three - dimensions , we will concentrate on two dimensions , which corresponds to arrays of cylinders of arbitrary cross - section , with the average field aligned in the @xmath20 plane",
    ". the area fractions of the two phases will be denoted @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "since the geometry has square symmetry , keller s theorem  @xcite gives @xmath23 this equation then pairs zeros of @xmath5 at values @xmath24 with poles at values @xmath25 .",
    "of course , from  ( [ eq2 ] ) , zeros of @xmath5 require that the contributions @xmath18 and @xmath19 add up to zero . since , with @xmath26 , @xmath19 is real and positive , this means @xmath18 must be real and negative , and so @xmath27 must be real and negative at any zero of @xmath5 , and thus at any pole as well .",
    "bergman  @xcite proved this property for both two - dimensional and three - dimensional composites .",
    "bergman also recognized that even though the transport problem when the average electric field @xmath12 is prescribed does not have a solution at a pole , it should have a solution at a pole when instead the average displacement field @xmath28 is prescribed .",
    "milton  @xcite proved that for the value @xmath29 the electrostatic problem of an array of circular cylinders , with either a prescribed value of the average electric field @xmath12 or a prescribed average value of the displacement field @xmath28 , does not have a solution , compare with the discussion of  ( [ eq : int1 ] ) below .",
    "this suggests that @xmath29 is either an essential singularity or lies on a branch - cut of the function @xmath5 for arrays of circular cylinders .",
    "the fact that branch - cuts can not be in the upper or lower half - planes , but must lie exactly on the negative real axis of @xmath2 was proved by one of the authors @xcite , using the relationship between composite materials and resistor networks .",
    "a rigorous justification of the spectral representation for @xmath5 was given by golden and papanicolaou  @xcite .",
    "in general the function @xmath5 has the representation @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the spectral measure @xmath32 are non - negative .",
    "the support of @xmath32 is the spectrum .",
    "the spectral measure can be recovered from the values that the imaginary part of @xmath5 takes near the negative real @xmath2-axis since the integral of any smooth test function @xmath33 with respect to the measure @xmath32 is given by @xmath34    the discrete spectrum of @xmath5 is readily exhibited numerically .",
    "this has been done for arrays of spheres by bergman  @xcite and for arrays of circular cylinders by mcphedran and mckenzie  @xcite , with both studies showing that the poles and zeros of @xmath5 converge to an essential singularity at @xmath29 .",
    "we focus now on what can be said about the continuous spectrum of @xmath5 .",
    "one simple geometry for which a result is immediately apparent is the checkerboard , for which dykhne  @xcite obtained from keller s theorem  ( [ eq2 ] ) the exact result @xmath35 this then exhibits a branch cut along the entire negative real axis of @xmath2 .",
    "an exact result can also be obtained for the polarizability @xmath36 of a pair of touching cylinders  @xcite .",
    "using an inversion of coordinates about the contact point , the touching cylinders may be transformed into a slab of matrix material with permittivity @xmath26 surrounded by two half - planes filled with material with permittivity @xmath37 .",
    "introducing the parameter @xmath38 it is easy to show using the method of images that the polarizability for a pair of touching cylinders of radius @xmath39 for the case of the applied field parallel to the line connecting cylinder centres is @xmath40 we see that the series in ( [ dilog1 ] ) converges provided @xmath41 , i.e. for real @xmath2 , @xmath42 .",
    "however , we can obtain a meaningful result even when this is not the case by the technique of analytic continuation , since the series in ( [ dilog1 ] ) is a known transcendental function , called the dilogarithm , and denoted @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we can replace ( [ dilog1 ] ) by @xmath44 the properties of the dilogarithm function are that it has a branch cut running from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , across which the discontinuity in the imaginary part of @xmath47 is @xmath48 $ ] . the branch cut in the plane of relative permittivity runs from @xmath49 to @xmath29 .",
    "if the direction of the applied field is perpendicular to the line of centres , the branch cut runs from @xmath29 to @xmath50 .",
    "we next consider arrays of square inclusions , for which we have already mentioned the dykhne result ( [ dyk ] ) .",
    "a generalization of this for an array in which the square unit cell was divided into four equal squares with dielectric permittivities @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , was conjectured by mortola and steff  @xcite : @xmath53^{1/2 } \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2\\epsilon_3+\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2\\epsilon_4        + \\epsilon_1\\epsilon_3\\epsilon_4+\\epsilon_2\\epsilon_3\\epsilon_4 } { \\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_3+\\epsilon_4}\\right)^{1/2}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq3a}\\ ] ] this conjecture was proved independently by milton @xcite and craster and obnosov @xcite .",
    "we will consider a particular sub - case of this result , due to obnosov @xcite : an array of square cylinders with area fractions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for which ( [ eq3a ] ) gives @xmath56 this formula yields a spectrum consisting solely of a branch - cut running from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "we compare the result given by this formula for the real part of @xmath5 with the result of a numerical mode matching procedure in fig .",
    "this comparison reveals the difficulty of evincing details of the spectrum using numerical methods : the mode matching technique approximates the branch cut by a discrete set of poles , which becomes more dense as the number of modes increases .",
    "however , it is difficult to distinguish between branch cuts and sets of poles concentrating around an essential singularity by such methods .",
    "furthermore , the mode matching method failed to give clear indications of the spectrum for area fractions of cylinders distinct from @xmath54 .    ) for the effective relative dielectric permittivity of the square array of square cylinders , while the red curve gives the result of a mode - matching method @xcite.,width=453 ]    the behaviour of fields near corners of inclusions in a matrix of differing dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability was treated in electromagnetism by j. meixner  @xcite . as well as obtaining the exponents which characterize the singularity of the field components near the edge , meixner pointed out that exactly the same formulae could be applied in electrostatics and magnetostatics .",
    "hetherington and thorpe  @xcite analysed the behaviour of fields near corners in electrostatics and magnetostatics , apparently without knowledge of meixner s paper .",
    "they however pointed out the link between field behaviour near corners and the nature of the singularity spectrum in composites containing inclusions with corners .",
    "let us suppose that the electrostatic potential varies with distance @xmath59 from a corner with an included angle @xmath60 as @xmath61 , and that the permittivity ratio inside the inclusion to that outside is @xmath2",
    ". then  @xcite @xmath62 is found by solving a transcendental equation : @xmath63}{\\tan ( \\beta \\psi)}=-\\sigma\\ , , \\label{transeq}\\ ] ] or the same equation with @xmath2 replaced by @xmath64 . for @xmath2 real ,",
    "the solution @xmath62 of ( [ transeq ] ) is either pure real or pure imaginary .    to clarify the behaviour of fields ,",
    "consider the case of @xmath65 , corresponding to a @xmath66 corner .",
    "then ( [ transeq ] ) gives @xmath67 from this , we see that the right - hand side exceeds one in magnitude for @xmath2 lying between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and that @xmath62 is then pure imaginary , corresponding to a solution for the potential which oscillates with @xmath59 , and the oscillations become ever more rapid as @xmath59 tends to zero . the electric field is given by the spatial derivative of the potential , and it diverges like @xmath70 multiplied by the oscillating term as @xmath71 .",
    "the branch cut region here is that where @xmath62 is imaginary , i.e. , between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "hetherington and thorpe @xcite postulate that for an @xmath72 sided regular polygon , there will be a branch cut running between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "they made this assertion after recognizing that in this interval of @xmath2 the surface charge ( rather that just the surface charge density ) near the corner is infinite , which is unphysical .",
    "another argument for the position of this branch cut was put forward by one of the authors @xcite . in order that @xmath0 have a significant imaginary part when @xmath75 has a very small imaginary part we see from ( [ epsdef ] ) that the electric field @xmath76 must be close to losing its square integrability . from the asymptotic form of @xmath11 near the corner",
    "one finds that this happens when the imaginary part of @xmath2 is very small and real part of @xmath2 is between @xmath77 and @xmath78 . to elucidate this further for the case of a @xmath66 corner we solve ( [ squcorn ] ) with @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are real , @xmath83 , and @xmath82 and @xmath84 are both very small and positive",
    "this gives @xmath85 using polar coordinates @xmath86 near the corner , the potential @xmath11 scales as @xmath87 as @xmath88 , and so @xmath89 will be close to @xmath90 for some function @xmath91 .",
    "it follows that with @xmath37 and @xmath26 the imaginary part of @xmath18 ( which is a measure of the power dissipation in the composite ) has a contribution near the corner from inside the radius @xmath92 of @xmath93 where the integral over @xmath94 is only over those angles in the inclusion .",
    "thus , provided @xmath91 is non - zero , the contribution of the corner to the imaginary part of @xmath18 remains non - zero even in the limit @xmath95 ( and goes to zero when @xmath96 or @xmath97 since then @xmath98 ) .",
    "a corner is not the only geometric feature which can act as a significant energy absorber when the imaginary part of the dielectric constant goes to zero .",
    "the center of a sphere with a dielectric constant @xmath99 in the radial direction and dielectric constant @xmath100 in the tangential direction acts as an absorber when @xmath101 approaches real values less than @xmath102 : see figure 4 in the paper of qui and lukyanchuk @xcite ( which shows that this energy absorbing feature extends beyond the quasistatic limit ) and see also the related discussion on page 239 of @xcite ( where there is an error as the limit @xmath103 should have been taken rather than the limit @xmath104 ) .",
    "we now describe a numerical method stable and accurate enough to verify the conjecture of hetherington and thorpe for the case @xmath105 , and to show the spectral evolution as a function of area fraction for composites with square inclusions .",
    "laplace s equation is to be solved on a doubly periodic domain @xmath15 .",
    "the boundary conditions on the positively oriented interface @xmath106 between the inclusion phase and the matrix phase are given in section  [ sec : over ] .",
    "an average electric field @xmath107 of unit strength is applied .",
    "the permittivity of the matrix phase is set to @xmath26 so that the effective permittivity is equal to the effective relative permittivity . from the repeated solution to this problem for various @xmath37 we obtain @xmath5 .",

    "one has to be selective with the choice of numerical method .",
    "we chose an integral equation based scheme .",
    "such schemes have the advantage that they can retain stability also in very difficult situations .",
    "our particular choice of integral equation is standard  a single - layer equation  @xcite . for its solution",
    "we use a novel numerical method called _ recursive compressed inverse preconditioning_. conceptually this is a local multilevel technique which makes a change of basis and expresses the non - smooth solution to the single - layer equation in terms of a piecewise smooth transformed layer density which can be cheaply resolved by polynomials .",
    "discretization leads to a block diagonal transformation matrix @xmath112 ( an inverse preconditioner ) where the columns of a particular block can be interpreted as special basis functions for the original density in the vicinity of a corner vertex multiplied with suitable quadrature weights .",
    "the blocks of @xmath113 are constructed in a fast recursion , @xmath114 , where step @xmath115 inverts and compresses contributions to @xmath113 involving the outermost quadrature panels on level @xmath115 of a locally @xmath116-ply refined mesh .",
    "we emphasize that the method is strictly numerical and fully automatic .",

    "we first consider the evolution of the variation of @xmath122 as @xmath21 in the square array ranges from zero to unity .",

    ". the most important feature of animation 1 is quite clear : for @xmath2 real , and for all values of @xmath21 , and except at the poles , non - zero values of @xmath125 are confined to the interval @xmath126 , in accord with the suggestion of hetherington and thorpe @xcite .",
    "of course , the value of this imaginary part is always positive , if we restrict ourselves to composites without gain ( for which the imaginary part would be always negative ) .    below the area fraction of 0.25 , the real part of @xmath127 is positive , and it develops its first pole at this area fraction .",

    "animation 2 illustrates the behaviour of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath2 for area fractions ranging from zero to 0.5 ( with the behaviour for @xmath21 in the range 0.5 to 1.0 following from that in the lower range using keller s theorem  ( [ eq2 ] ) . as has been commented in section  [ sec : over ] ,",
    "the interesting question is how the branch - cut location ( from @xmath49 to @xmath50 ) for @xmath133 of equation  ( [ dyk ] ) can be reconciled with that ( from @xmath57 to @xmath58 ) predicted by hetherington and thorpe @xcite for @xmath21 arbitrarily near @xmath134 .",
    "a mechanism for this reconciliation was provided by one of the present authors @xcite : discrete sets of poles in @xmath135 and @xmath136 were predicted to become denser and denser as @xmath21 approached @xmath134 , thus extending the branch cut in the limit to that required by ( [ dyk ] ) .",

    "4 shows a stage in this evolution where @xmath21 is very close to @xmath134 .",
    "animation  2 makes the `` nursery role '' of the region around @xmath29 in the development of the spectrum much more evident ( due to larger amplitudes of the quasipoles ) than does animation  1 .",
    "the sensitivity of the spectral details for the staggered array near the checkerboard configuration are very evident in animation 2 . as we have commented in section  [ sec : over ] , the asymptotics of fields near corners are the same in electromagnetism as in electrostatics @xcite .",
    "thus , attempts such as that in @xcite to model the transition from electromagnetically reflecting structures to electromagnetically transmitting structures as @xmath21 moves through 1/2 would require an adaptive and recursive method like that described in section  [ sec : numer ] to be able to achieve sufficient accuracy .",
    "in this paper we have brought together rigorous mathematical results with numerical investigations of unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the latter have revealed the generality of the former , and have substantiated a conjecture of hetherington and thorpe @xcite in a striking and conclusive way .",
    "we conclude by commenting further on how the arguments and results we have presented can be implemented in a practical demonstration of morphological super - resolution , uniting the ideas of kac @xcite and pendry @xcite .",
    "such a demonstration would require the fabrication of a set of parallel cylinders with a square cross section ( or polygonal cross section ) .",
    "the cylinders do not have to be arranged in a geometrically - perfect array , and they do not have to be densely packed .",
    "they have to be made of a material which is essentially non - absorbing and with a negative permittivity or permeability .",
    "these requirements suggest the set of cylinders be made of metal , of size 10 @xmath137 m or larger , and be probed with wavelengths far greater than the cylinder size in the far infrared or longer .",
    "such cylinders are large by today s lithographic standards , and so it should be possible to accurately form their corners to achieve sub - wavelength accuracy . going into the far infrared region diminishes metallic loss from its value in the visible and near - infrared @xcite .",
    "it is crucial that the metallic loss be very low , since the experimental signature we suggest be probed is enhanced absorption by a set of such cylinders over a wavelength interval in which the metal s permittivity ranges from say -1/3 to -3 ( scaled relative to the permittivity of a host dielectric in which the cylinders are embedded ) .",
    "note that the enhanced absorption of incident radiation detected will increase as more lines of cylinders are added to the set .    the experimental result which would indicate morphological super - resolution is an enhanced absorption for wavelengths far in excess of the cylinder size , switching on and off at geometrically - determined limits described above , independent of the arrangement and area fraction of the cylinders .",
    "we stress however that such a demonstration would indicate the physical relevance of the ideas we have described for a particular system .",
    "the mathematical results we have described are of course rigorous , and the numerical examples of them we have given are highly accurate , so our demonstration of super - resolution for wavelengths arbitrarily larger than the size of the particles probed does not rely for its validity on experimental support",
    ". they may be applicable to governing equations other than the helmholtz equation , for which the ideas of metamaterials and their applications are currently being explored @xcite .",

    "to keep the notation short we make no distinction between points or vectors in a real plane @xmath138 and points in a complex plane @xmath139 .",
    "all points will be denoted @xmath140 or @xmath141 .",
    "the potential function @xmath142 in @xmath15 is represented as a sum of a driving term and a single - layer potential with density @xmath143  @xcite .",
    "enforcement of the boundary conditions on @xmath106 leads to the fredholm second kind integral equation @xmath144 here @xmath145 is the outward unit normal of @xmath106 at @xmath140 , @xmath110 denotes the restriction of @xmath106 to @xmath146 , and @xmath147 is as in  ( [ eq : lmb ] ) . note that , as @xmath148 we have @xmath149 and  ( [ eq : int1 ] ) is no longer a second kind equation , but a first kind equation whose ( unique ) solvability is by no means guaranteed .",
    "therefore one can say that @xmath29 is a _",
    "singularity _ of  ( [ eq : int1 ] ) .",
    "once  ( [ eq : int1 ] ) is solved for @xmath143 and under the assumption that the inclusions do not overlap the unit cell boundary , the effective relative permittivity in the direction of the applied electric field can be computed from @xmath150    depending on how the unit cell is chosen , the squares in the staggered array may overlap the unit cell boundary . with the choice in fig .",
    "[ fig : boards ] , they certainly do .",
    "but since @xmath143 is a periodic function and identical on all squares one can circumvent this problem by modifying  ( [ eq : eff1 ] ) so that it integrates @xmath143 twice on the square at the center of the unit cell and ignores @xmath143 on the other squares .      we discretize  ( [ eq : int1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : eff1 ] ) using a nystrm method based on composite 16-point polynomial interpolatory quadrature and a parametrization @xmath151 of @xmath106 .",

    "an initial coarse mesh that resolves the kernel of the integral operator in  ( [ eq : int1 ] ) away from the corner vertices is constructed on @xmath106 , see fig .",

    "the subdivision is done @xmath116 times in a direction towards the vertices .",
    "on quadrature panels which neighbour corner vertices we choose quadrature nodes according to the zeros of certain jacobi polynomials . on remaining panels we choose quadrature nodes according to the zeros of legendre polynomials .",

    "the vector @xmath157 corresponds to the discretization of the piecewise smooth right hand side .",
    "now the kernel @xmath158 of the integral operator in  ( [ eq : int1 ] ) is split into two functions @xmath159 where @xmath160 takes care of corner interaction and @xmath161 can be viewed as the kernel of a compact integral operator .",
    "the kernel split  ( [ eq : split ] ) corresponds to an operator split and the change of variables @xmath162 makes  ( [ eq : gen1 ] ) read @xmath163 this right - preconditioned equation corresponds to the discretization of a fredholm second kind equation with compact operators .",
    "the solution @xmath164 is the discretization of a piecewise smooth function .",
    "the matrix @xmath165 , the density @xmath164 , and the right hand side @xmath166 in  ( [ eq : gen2 ] ) can be evaluated on the coarse mesh without the loss of precision .",
    "only @xmath167 needs the refined mesh for its accurate evaluation .",
    "this enables a compression of  ( [ eq : gen2 ] ) .",
    "we introduce the compressed weighted inverse @xmath168 here @xmath169 is an unweighted prolongation operator that performs panelwise 15th - degree polynomial interpolation in the parameter @xmath152 ( which as we recall parameterizes @xmath106 through @xmath151 ) from points on the coarse mesh to points on the fine mesh when acting on column vectors from the left .",

    "the construction of @xmath113 from its definition  ( [ eq : r0 ] ) may be a costly and unstable operation when the refined mesh has many panels .",
    "the number of subdivisions @xmath116 needed to reach a given accuracy may grow without bounds due to the singularities in @xmath143 that arise as @xmath2 approaches certain values .",
    "fortunately , the construction of each block of @xmath113 , associated with a corner of the square array or with a corner - meet of the staggered array , can be greatly sped up and also stabilized via a recursion .",

    "it would be going too far to describe all the fine details of this procedure , but sections  3.2 and  3.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite give a fairly good idea of how the recursion is set up in the present context .",
    "a key step is the ( partial ) conversion of the recursion into a non - linear matrix equation .",
