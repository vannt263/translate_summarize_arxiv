    "the possibilities of existence of stoneley waves propagating at the interface of two welded half - spaces are quite restricted , especially when the semi - infinite bodies are made of _ dissimilar _ crystals .",
    "for example , owen ( 1964 ) famously studied 900 combinations of isotropic materials and found only 31 pairs supporting stoneley waves .",
    "similar conclusions are also reached when the materials are anisotropic . in general , the existence of an interfacial stoneley wave is highly sensitive to the differences in material parameters for each medium , in particular to the difference in shear wave speeds ( chadwick & currie , 1974 ) .",
    "the situation is somewhat more favorable when the half - spaces are made of misoriented but _ identical _ crystals .",
    "for instance , stoneley waves were found to exist for any angle of misorientation and for propagation along the twist - angle bisectrix in the case of some hypothetical crystal by lim & musgrave ( 1970 ) , copper by thln ( 1984 ) , gallium arsenide by barnett et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , or silicon by mozhaev et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; they also exist for 180 degrees domain boundaries of barium titanate or quartz ( mozhaev & weihnacht , 1996 , 1997 ) , for propagation in any direction in the interface plane . in these articles ,",
    "the interface is normal to a crystallographic axis which is itself common to each half - space .",
    "now consider the interface described in figure 1 , where the upper and lower half - spaces are made of the same crystal with at least rhombic symmetry and with misoriented crystallographic axes @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( represented on the figure making an angle @xmath2 with the interface and its normal ) and common crystallographic axis @xmath3 ( normal to the plane of the figure ) . this geometry of chevron or `` herringbone '' pattern might be encountered in crystals subjected to a gliding twinning plane , or to the formation of conjugate kink bands through compression .",
    "hussain and ogden ( 2000 ) recently proposed a theoretical simulation of the plastic deformation associated with the twinning of crystals , with a possible exploitation in non - destructive testing of materials .",
    "another way of producing such twins would be the following .",
    "consider an infinite crystal with orthotropic or higher symmetry ; cut it in two halves so that the plane interface contains one crystallographic axis ( @xmath4 say ) and makes an angle @xmath5 with another crystallographic axis ( @xmath6 say ) , see figure 2(a ) ; then rotate one half - space by 180 degrees about the normal to the interface , see figure 2(b ) ; finally rebond the half - spaces , see figure 2(c ) .",
    "a thorough review article by gsele and tong ( 1998 ) presents several experimental procedures of wafer bonding ( also known as direct bonding or fusion bonding or `` gluing without glue '' ) and its numerous applications , not only for silicon - based sensors and actuators but also in microsystem technologies , nonlinear optics , light - emitting diodes , etc . using gallium arsenide , quartz , or sapphire .",
    "when the boundary conditions take the symmetries of the problem into consideration then the interface wave is found to be linearly polarized at the interface , either longitudinally or transversally .",
    "once these effective boundary conditions are established in section 2 ( and appendix ) , two corresponding secular equations are derived explicitly in section 3 as cubics in the squared wave speed .",
    "the results are illustrated graphically for gallium arsenide and for silicon . for these materials",
    ", it turns out that one of the secular equations corresponds to a non - physical supersonic leaky interface wave , and that the other corresponds to a subsonic interface acoustic wave having the characteristics of a stoneley wave : decay with increasing distance from the interface , speed larger than that of the corresponding surface rayleigh wave .",
    "consider stoneley waves traveling with speed @xmath7 and wave number @xmath8 at the interface of a bimaterial made of two perfectly bonded orthotropic media .",
    "both half - spaces are made of the same crystal ( mass density @xmath9 , non - zero reduced compliances @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , the normal to the interface @xmath11 and the direction of propagation @xmath12 are inclined at an angle @xmath5 to the crystallographic axes @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the lower ( @xmath15 ) half - space and at an angle @xmath16 for the upper ( @xmath17 ) half - space .    in the lower half - space ,",
