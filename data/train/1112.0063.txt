    "dust is a crucial component of galaxies in modifying the observed properties of galaxies by absorbing and scattering starlight , and also re - emits the absorbed energy in the mid- and far - infrared bands .",
    "the extinction cross section of dust generally decreases with increasing wavelength , i.e. , the extinction is more severe at shorter wavelength , particularly at ultra - violet ( uv ) band . as a result , the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of galaxies appear redder , which is so - called `` reddening '' .",
    "the effects of dust should be properly accounted for when interpreting the observations of the galaxies , for example the luminosity or star formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy . for a galaxy with spectroscopic data covering suitable wavelengths , it is usually possible to estimate the amount of dust extinction from the spectrum .",
    "for example , the average dust reddening of hii  regions can be derived from balmer decrement , and be used to correct for the dust attenuation to the emission - line luminosity . in other cases , one has to rely on empirical relations to get an estimate of dust extinction in a statistical way .    additionally , it is necessary to incorporate dust into the galaxy formation and evolution model .",
    "currently there are two ways to account for dust effects : full radiative transfer calculations assuming dust properties and geometric distribution , or adopting simple recipes obtained empirically .",
    "since the dust formation in the galactic environment is a complicated chemical process , it has not yet been implemented in the current galaxy evolution models .",
    "the dust properties and distribution are input in the models and should be tested with observations .",
    "alternatively , many authors have adopted the empirical relations to compute the perpendicular optical depth of a galactic disc , and then assign a random inclination angle for each galaxy to get the final dust corrections ( e.g. guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange 1987 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "1999 ; somerville & primack 1999 ; de lucia , kauffmann & white 2004 ; de lucia & blaizot 2007 ; kang et al . 2005 ; kitzbichler & white 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , a well - defined empirical recipe of dust reddening will help the comparison of model predictions with observations .",
    "previous studies have suggested that dust reddening in star - forming galaxies is correlated with the sfr , which can be well estimated with the intrinsic h@xmath0  luminosity ( e.g. kennicutt 1998 ; calzetti et al .",
    "galaxies with large sfr ( or high luminosity ) show strong global extinction in the emission lines ( e.g. , wang & heckman 1996 ; charlot & fall 2000 ; calzetti 2001 ; stasiska & sodr 2001 ; afonso et al . 2003 ; kewley et al . 2004 ; zoran , barkana , & thompson 2006 ; calzetti et al . 2007 ;",

    "2010 ) , and also large infrared to ultraviolet flux ratios ( e.g. , iglesias - paramo et al .",
    "2006 and reference therein ) .",
    "in addition , it has been recognized that dust reddening might also be a function of gas - phase metallicity , i.e. the reddening and extinction increase with metallicity .",
    "for instance , the average reddening to hii  regions in an individual galaxy is correlated with the metallicity in the disc ( e.g. , quillen & yukita 2001 ; boisser et al .",
    "for the case of whole galaxies , the relationship between reddening and metallicity also exists ( e.g. heckman et al .",
    "1998 ; buat et al .",
    "2002 ; asari et al .",
    "it is also supported by the fact that the low - metallicity galaxies such as blue compact galaxies are usually less reddened ( e.g. kong 2004 ) .",
    "recently , garn & best ( 2010 ) also found a significant correlation between dust extinction and metallicity , however , they claimed that the dependency of reddening on stellar mass is more fundamental .",
    "they built a sample of about 90 000 star - forming galaxies using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data , and compare the relationship between the dust extinction of h@xmath0luminosity and sfr , metallicity as well as stellar mass , respectively .",
    "they concluded that the dust extinction @xmath3 can be best predicted from the stellar mass , with a scatter of @xmath10.3 mag .    besides",
    ", the dependency of dust attenuation on inclination has been also investigated . while the correlation between dust attenuation of optical stellar continuum and disc inclination has been well established for disc galaxies ( e.g. driver et al .",
    "2007 ; shao et al . 2007 ; unterborn & ryden 2008 ) , that of emission lines is still uncertain ( e.g. yip et al . 2010 ) .    these works focused on how the dust reddening depends on one property of galaxies , luminosity , metallicity or stellar mass , which are generally correlated with each other ( e.g. garnett & shields 1987 ; skillman et al . 1989 ; zaritsky et al . 1994",

    "( 2005 ) , if the nuclear spectrum contains less than twenty percent of the total galaxy light , we will likely over - estimate the global metallicity and reddening , and under - estimate the global sfr by a significant fraction .",

    ", we will pick out the late - type ( presumably disc - dominated ) galaxies from the star - forming galaxies based on the likelihoods provided by sdss pipeline .",

    "2002 ) . for a galaxy , @xmath17(star_l )",
    "is generally zero .",

    "this parameter is also correlated with the compactness index such as @xmath19 , which is commonly used in quantitative classification ( e.g. shimasaku et al .",

    "with this criterion , 23919 star - forming galaxies are classified as disc galaxies , and 7650 as elliptical galaxies , and 595 as unclassified type .    [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to investigate the origin of the scatter in the empirical relations , we examine the correlation between @xmath20  and other galaxy parameters , such as stellar mass , the 4000    break index , ew of balmer absorption lines , the electron density in hii  region or concentration index .",
    "the @xmath20  for either ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , _ b / a _ ) model or ( @xmath23 , @xmath22 , _ b / a _ ) model is not correlated with any of the parameters above , implying that the dust reddening in a disc galaxy is primarily determined by only three physical properties : luminosity ( sfr ) / surface brightness ( sfr surface density ) , metallicity and disc inclination .",
    "we also attempt another multi - parameter model ( @xmath24 , @xmath22 , _ b / a _ ) with similar procedure described above , and find that the scatter of @xmath20  is 0.072 mag , which is slightly larger than the two models above ( equation  [ eq : powfit ] and [ eq : powfit_br ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath20  for this model is still weakly correlated with @xmath21  ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "this suggests that ( @xmath21  or sfr , @xmath22 ) combination works better than ( @xmath24 , @xmath22 ) combination .",
    "physically , at a given metallicity , the amount of dust is proportional to the amount of cold gas , which is closely correlated with sfr .",
    "we compare our models with previous empirical relations .",
    "garn & best ( 2010 ) investigate the dependency of dust extinction at h@xmath0  on sfr , metallicity and stellar mass respectively , in star - forming galaxies based on sdss database .",
    "they conclude that the stellar mass is the most fundamental parameter in determining the dust extinction in the local universe , and their relation between stellar mass and dust extinction seems to hold up to redshift of 1.5 ( sobral et al .",
    "they utilize different models to fit the extinction @xmath27 , with each model taking into consideration one of the three parameters : sfr , @xmath24 and metallicity .",
    "they find that the @xmath24 model gives the best fit , with the minimum of scatter ( 0.28 mag ) in the extinction residual @xmath28 , less than the scatter for sfr model and metallicity model , both of which are 0.33 mag .",
    "when calculating the @xmath27 , they adopt the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) dust attenuation - curve .",
    "we repeat their analysis for our selected sample of disc galaxies and compare the scatter of @xmath29 among different models . in each model",
    "a low - order ( third order ) polynomial is adopted to fit the extinction , and the distribution of @xmath29 is well fitted by a gaussian , with widths @xmath300.27 , 0.28 and 0.28 mag for the @xmath24 , @xmath21  ( sfr ) and metallicity model respectively .",
    "higher order polynomial fits will not decrease the scatter .",
    "we check the scatter of @xmath29 for our ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , _ b / a _ ) or ( @xmath23 , @xmath22 , _ b / a _ ) model assuming calzetti s attenuation law , and the gaussian width is only @xmath31 mag ( corresponding to @xmath32 mag for the @xmath20  distribution ) .",
    "we also check for the ( @xmath24 , @xmath22 , _ b / a _ ) model , and find that the scatter of @xmath29 is 0.24 mag , which is better than the single - parameter models , but worse than the other two multi - parameter models .",
    "our empirical relations predict dust reddening better than the single - parameter models , probably because we include disc inclination in the analysis . in order to investigate what dominates the relationships of the variables , we apply principle component analysis on the physical variables .",
    "the derived principle components ( pcs ) are linear combinations of the variables , and represent for the directions of maximum variance in the data . for h@xmath0",
    "luminosity and surface brightness , @xmath2 , @xmath24 and metallicity , the quantities are normalized to zero mean and standard deviation of unity , while for the axial ratio original value is used .",
    "we test with different subsets of variables adopted in each multi - parameter model as well as all of the variables , and find similar results .",
    "take the case of ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , _ b / a _ ) model for example , the first two pcs contribute to about 80 percent of the total variance .",
    "in pc1 , the variables @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath2  weight almost equivalently . this is consistent with what garn & best ( 2010 ) found .",
    "but in pc2 the axial ratio weights the most ( -0.98 ) and @xmath2  weights the second ( 0.30 ) .",
    "the result is consistent with what we previously found .",
    "although the axial ratio only weakly correlated with @xmath2  ( @xmath33 , @xmath26 ) , after removing the @xmath2  dependence on h@xmath0  luminosity and metallicity , the negative correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath2  emerges .",
    "we have shown that the global reddening of the emission lines from a disc galaxy can be reasonably determined by its h@xmath0  luminosity or surface brightness , gas metallicity and disc inclination .",
    "the @xmath35 scatter of @xmath20  is about 0.07 mag , which is contributed by several sources , including the measurement uncertainty in the balmer decrement , the error in the metallicity , the uncertainties in other variables and the intrinsic scatter in the relation .",
    "we will discuss the uncertainties in the following .",
    "let us take a review of the uncertainties in the physical quantities .",
    "the formal error for @xmath21  measurement is 0.04 dex , and for @xmath23  is 0.05 dex . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : lhacor ] , the uncertainty induced by aperture - correction and attenuation - correction is less than 0.12 dex .",
    "the typical error of @xmath34 is 0.02 .",
    "the uncertainty in metallicity calibration dominates the uncertainty of metallicity , estimated to be @xmath36 dex .",
    "we use monte carlo simulation to estimate the error of @xmath2  for equation  [ eq : powfit ] and [ eq : powfit_br ] taking the uncertainties for the best - fit parameters and the measurement errors for the physical variables .",
    "the errors of @xmath2  predicted by equation  [ eq : powfit ] and [ eq : powfit_br ] are both about 0.056 mag . if taking the uncertainty in aperture - correction and attenuation - correction ( 0.12 dex at most ) into account in @xmath21  and @xmath23  error , the simulated @xmath2  errors slightly changes to 0.058 mag .",
    "remember that the measurement error of @xmath2is 0.03 mag , the scatter of @xmath20  ( 0.07 mag ) can be almost explained by the uncertainties of the physical quantities .",
    "considering all these uncertainties , @xmath2  predicted from the empirical relations are quite consistent with the observed values .    from figure",
    "[ fig : debv - dist ] we can see that the @xmath20  distribution can be well described by a gaussian profile , indicative of a random distribution . however , the intrinsic scatter of the empirical relation is still unclear , because of the large uncertainty in the metallicity calibration .",
    "therefore , to estimate the intrinsic scatter of the relation , it will be of help to decrease the uncertainty in the metallicity calibration and obtain the metallicity more precisely .",
    "one may find there is slight excess over the positive tail of the gaussian distribution .",
    "we examine the objects ( about one percent of the whole sample ) with @xmath37 , i.e. the observed @xmath2  is under - estimated with our empirical models by 0.2 mag , and find that these objects are prone to large balmer decrement , low h@xmath13  s / n and low h@xmath13  ew .",
    "as previously mentioned , we require s / n@xmath38 for h@xmath0 , and s / n@xmath39 for h@xmath13  and [ oiii ]  when selecting our sample in section  [ sec : sample ] .",
    "the s / n criteria for h@xmath0  will exclude some galaxies with low sfr and low h@xmath0  ew .",
    "thus the number of galaxies with low h@xmath0  luminosity and low sfr will be reduced .",
    "in fact , when the criteria s / n@xmath39 is applied for h@xmath13 , most of the remaining sample ( @xmath199.9 percent ) will have h@xmath0s / n@xmath38 . in order to investigate whether the h@xmath13  and [ oiii ]  s / n criteria bias our results , we attempt a looser s / n(@xmath40 ) criteria for both lines , and the sample is expanded by 50 percent to have 34815 galaxies",
    ". then we fit the data with both the ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , _ b / a _ ) model and ( @xmath23 , @xmath22 , _ b / a _ ) model .",
    "the results show that the fit parameters are quite similar as those we have obtained in section  [ sec : relation ] , but the scatter in @xmath20  increases to about 0.08 mag .",
    "note that 10 percent uncertainty in h@xmath0/h@xmath13  will result in an uncertainty of 0.086 mag in @xmath2 , which explains the increased scatter . thus including the low s",
    "/ n objects merely introduces more scatter in the relation .",
    "two different sources contribute to the extinction for hii  regions : dust associated with the individual hii  region and diffuse foreground dust in the galaxy . let us first consider the dust in the precursor molecular clouds ( mc ) .",
    "the intrinsic extinction in individual hiiregion depends on the relative distribution of young massive stars , gas and dust in the star - formation regions , which are also closely related to the age and size of the precursor mc , as well as the stochastic formation of high mass stars for a given initial mass function .",
    "an hii  region is embedded in the cold gas / dust envelope before the cold gas / dust is blown away .",
    "the time scale for such a process is expected to depend on the size and density of the precursor cloud : longer for more massive and dense hii  region .",
    "panuzzo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discussed the attenuation to the h@xmath0  emission line for different evaporating time scale , in comparison with the lifetime of massive stars that produce the ionizing continuum .",
    "they simply adopt a central ionizing star in a spherical cloud , which corresponds to the maximum attenuation case .",
    "if the time scale is short enough , most hiiregions are produced outside of the mc , and the main attenuation is due to foreground dust . in the case of long evaporation time ,",
    "an hii  region is buried in the mc during most of their life time and the extinction associated with the hii  region will be important . in a galaxy ,",
    "all these cases are likely present .",
    "furthermore , the young ionizing stars are not necessarily forming in the cloud centre .",
    "these complications make any prediction of the reddening in an individual cloud rather difficult .",
    "however , as far as a large number of hii  regions are concerned , the statistical behavior may be quite well defined .",
    "the h@xmath0  luminosity function of hii  regions in spiral galaxies can be described by double power - law functions , with a flatter power - law below the break luminosity of 38.6 ( in units of ergs  s@xmath5 , logarithmic ) , and a steeper one above it ( e.g. kennicutt et al .",
    "1989 ; bradley et al .",
    "2006 ) . in our sample , most galaxies have h@xmath0  luminosities above 40",
    "( in units of ergs  s@xmath5 , logarithmic ) with a median of 41.5 , and the maximum is 43.3 .",
    "therefore , a galaxy consists of numerous ( order of hundreds to millions of ) hii  regions .",
    "the hiiregions follow certain distributions of ages and initial masses , determined by the star - formation processes , because the star - formation time in a galaxy is likely much longer than the lifetime of an individual hii  region , i.e. the life time of ob stars .",
    "if these distributions are the same for each galaxy and there are a large number of hii  regions , one may expect that the average extinction within hii  regions should be similar in each galaxy . in this respect",
    ", it is not expected that the dust reddening depends on the h@xmath0  luminosity or the inclination of the disc .",
    "in contrast , for example , if the mc mass function and stellar imf depend on the global properties of the galaxies , such as the gas surface density , then one may expect that the average extinction is correlated with the global properties .",
    "however , this is poorly known so far .",
    "next , we consider the extinction due to diffuse interstellar dust in a galaxy .",
    "it is expected that this extinction depends on the gas surface density , inclination , metallicity of the interstellar medium and size of the galaxy . to simplify the model",
    ", we will adopt smooth distributions for the dust , gas and star - formation regions with the following assumptions :    ( 1 ) : :    dust - to - gas density ratio is proportional to the gas metallicity ( issa    et al .",

    "we can write : @xmath90    assuming the dust - to - gas ratio to be the same as in the galactic disc , i.e. , @xmath91 ( bohlin 1978 ) and a galactic extinction curve ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) , we obtain the effective optical depth to h@xmath0  through the disc perpendicularly as @xmath92 once we have @xmath93 , it is straightforward to calculate the extinction at h@xmath0  using equation  [ eq : lhal ] as following @xmath94 +    \\nonumber \\\\         & & \\hspace*{2em } \\exp[-\\frac{\\tau_\\mathrm{{h\\ensuremath{\\alpha}},0}}{\\cos i}\\exp(-a/\\eta)(2-y^{1/\\kappa } ) ] \\ } /   \\nonumber \\\\         & & \\hspace*{3em } 2[1-\\exp(-\\xi)-\\xi \\exp(-\\xi ) ]   , \\label{eq : ahal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , replacing @xmath81 with @xmath95 , one obtains the extinction at h@xmath13 .",
    "thus h@xmath0/h@xmath13  ratio can be calculated , and then @xmath21  can be corrected with the extinction estimated from the balmer decrement , as the extinction correction we make to the observed @xmath21 .    in order to examine if such a model can reproduce the observed correlations , we compute the average surface brightness @xmath23  and color excess @xmath2estimated by h@xmath0/h@xmath13  from the model based on the following parameters : @xmath80 , @xmath22 , @xmath82 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . to facilitate comparison with observation",
    ", we obtain @xmath23  following the same method used for observation ( equation  [ eq : br ] ) by dividing the attenuation - corrected @xmath21  with the surface within the half - light radius , defined as the radius within which the h@xmath0  luminosity is half of the total @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath2  is calculated from @xmath27  and @xmath96  assuming fitzpatrick s extinction curve .",
    "we first fix @xmath84 to be 1 .",
    "since increasing metallicity and inclination both cause an increase in extinction , these two factors are coupled in the model .",
    "therefore , we incorporate them into one parameter @xmath97 .",
    "we compute the models for a grid of parameters with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "the models are over - plotted on the observation sample on the @xmath23  versus @xmath2  plane ( figure  [ fig : br - ebv ] ) . for clarity ,",
    "we only show the observation sample in five bins of @xmath101 with a bin - width of 0.2 , and on each panel the subsample is binned in @xmath23  and shown in squares with error bars .",
    "we can see the observation trend on each panel , that @xmath2increases as @xmath23  increases .",
    "the model curves are calculated with the corresponding value of median @xmath101 for each subsample . on each panel",
    ", @xmath2  gets larger when @xmath85 increases , and each curve with constant @xmath85 first increases and then becomes flat as @xmath23  increases . at small @xmath85 ,",
    "i.e. the dust layer is much thinner than the stellar disc , @xmath2  saturates at a small value because the balmer - line emission from the disc of larger height tends to dominate , resulting in a small @xmath2 , while at large @xmath85 more balmer - line emission comes from the inner region close to the midplane of the disc , thus tend to have a large @xmath2 .",
    "the saturation is due to the fact that the observed light from outside weights more as the optical depth increases .",
    "generally the @xmath102 model reproduces the observed correlations at low @xmath101 .",
    "however , as @xmath101 increases , the constant @xmath85 model is lower than the observation trend at the high - end of @xmath23 . at medium @xmath101 ( 1.5@xmath12.5 ) ,",
    "the observation can be better presented by the model with larger @xmath85 ( e.g. @xmath103 ) .",
    "this could be explained by the vertical expansion of dust distribution in the disc while higher surface brightness indicates intenser star - formation activity .",
    "the dust may be driven away from the midplane of the disc by radiation pressure or the stellar winds , thus the dust layer become thicker than that for low @xmath23 .",
    "but @xmath2  saturates at about 0.3 mag when @xmath103 , which means that the effective optical depth saturates when the height of dust layer gets to twice height of hii  regions .",
    "another possible explanation is that the kennicutt - schimidt law we adopt in the model is an averaged star formation law that linked between the surface density of gas and star formation as the form of @xmath104 .",
    "leroy et al . ( 2008 ) suggested that the star formation law may vary as a function of local conditions at different galactocentric radius , including metallicity and the dominated gas content ( hi or h@xmath105 ) .",
    "the sf law has smaller @xmath106 value at higher @xmath86 in the inner region of a galaxy ( e.g. bigiel et al .",
    "2008 , their figure 11 ) , thus large dust reddening in the inner region dominates the observed @xmath2 . as a result , the dust reddening is higher than that the present model predicts .    in the model above , we assume @xmath107 , i.e. the dust and hii  region has the same characteristic scale in the radial distribution , but the gas / dust may distribute at larger radii than the star - forming regions ( e.g. bigiel et al . 2008 ) .",
    "thus we also consider @xmath108 , and find that the observation with large @xmath101 can be well explained by model with @xmath102 at low @xmath23  and @xmath103 at high @xmath23 .",
    "it is possible because in a spiral galaxy centre , where the metallicity is higher than outside , we are observing the star - formation dominated centre , and the gas ( or dust ) distribution is more extended .    in this simple toy model , the optical depth @xmath109 is assumed to be proportional to the metallicity @xmath22 .",
    "it comes from the assumption that @xmath110 .",
    "however , there is evidence that this assumption may be not the case in practice .",
    "boissier et al .",
    "( 2004 ) studied six nearby late - type galaxies in fir and uv images , and find that the dust - to - gas ratio is proportional to @xmath111 , which was flatter than the linear correlation we adopted above .",
    "this suggests that the dust - to - gas ratio may not evolve linearly with @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , we assume in the model that the disc height is very thin , i.e. the disc height is quite small compared to the disc radius , thus the radial gradient in gas density can be neglected when calculating @xmath109 . under that assumption",
    ", the effect of inclination on optical depth can be expressed as @xmath112 . however , in practice , the disc may not have a uniform height , for instance , it may be thicker in the centre and thinner at large radii , or the presence of bulge in the disc centre .",
    "also , the distribution of dust and star - formation regions may be not smooth , for example when the spiral arms are present in the disc galaxy . in those cases , the inclination factor might be flatter than @xmath112 . accounting for these realistic effects ,",
    "we adjust @xmath113 to @xmath114 in equation  [ eq : tau0 ] and @xmath112 to @xmath115 in equation  [ eq : lhal ] and [ eq : ahal ] , then test several values for the power - law index is adopted to be the same as that of @xmath22 , so as to be incorporated into @xmath101 . ] .",
    "it turns out that with @xmath116 the simple model reproduces the observation trend well ( figure  [ fig : br - ebv - z07 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath101 is low , the model of constant @xmath85 ( 0.5 or 1 ) reproduces the observation trend well . while @xmath101 is higher , the observation can be reproduced with the model of @xmath103 .    , except that the model is calculated with equation  [ eq : tau0 ] and [ eq : ahal ] , but adjusting @xmath113 to @xmath117 , and @xmath82 to @xmath118 .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    to summarize , the simple toy models reproduce the observed trends between dust reddening and h@xmath0  surface brightness , that reddening increases with @xmath23 .",
    "the comparisons between observation and the toy models indicate that , the relative distribution of hii  regions to gas / dust both in vertical and radial direction of the galaxy disc , may vary in different environment of star - formation activity levels or metallicities .",
    "the dust might be distributed further beyond the hii  regions when the star formation activity is intenser , or the dust is distributed in a thicker disc ( @xmath119 ) than the hii  regions when the metallicity gets higher .",
    "in addition , our results imply that dust - to - gas density ratio may be not proportional to the metallicity @xmath22 , but to a power - law of @xmath22 , @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "we present the empirical formulae of intrinsic reddening as a function of intrinsic h@xmath0  luminosity or surface brightness , metallicity and disc inclination ( equation  [ eq : powfit ] , [ eq : powfit_br ] and table  [ tab : lha ] and [ tab : br ] ) for a large sample of @xmath122 000 well - defined star - forming disc galaxies selected from the sdss . with the empirical formulae",
    ", the reddening parameterized by @xmath2  could be predicted within 1@xmath122 uncertainty of 0.07 mag .",
    "the @xmath20 , defined as the observed reddening estimated from the balmer decrement minus predicted value , does not correlate with the three parameters used in the formulae .",
    "we also find that @xmath20  is independent of the stellar mass , 4000   break strength or electron density within the galaxy .",
    "the observed trend between the dust reddening and h@xmath0  surface brightness could be reproduced by a plane - parallel slab toy model , in which the dust is scaled with gas , and all the distributions of the dust , gas and star - formation regions are smooth and follow exponential laws in the disc .",
    "we find from the comparisons of the models to the observation , the relative vertical scale of dust distribution to hii  regions distribution may vary with h@xmath0  surface brightness or metallicity . the higher intensity of star formation could drive the dust to distribute in a thicker layer , or the dust disc is thicker than the disc of the hiiregions when the metallicity is higher .",
    "however , the real galaxies may be not fully described by this simple toy model .",
    "for example , when the spiral arms are present , or the sf regions are clumpy , the assumptions of smooth distributions will be improper .",
    "in addition , our result implies a different scaling law of dust - to - gas ratio as a function of metallicity @xmath22 from the linearly relation ( equation  [ eq : rhod1 ] ) .",
    "our empirical relations , which suggest dust reddening is partially dependent on metallicity ( @xmath123 ) , can be an observational constraints on the output of radiative - transfer model calculations , and hence provides constraints on the assumed dust - to - gas ratio in the model .",
    "since metallicity - dependence has been introduced , we believe that our empirical formulae should be applicable to the early evolutionary stage of a galaxy , when the gas metallicity might be low . in the starburst galaxies at high",
    "redshift , dust surrounding star - forming region has been proven to be prone to sub - milimeter and far - infrared observations .",
    "but most of those galaxies are relatively dim in optical , implying severe extinction and reddening to these galaxies .",
    "the observed galaxies at high redshifts are affected by reddening , in the way that the galaxies with heavy attenuation and reddening may escape from the detection .",
    "the importance of the reddening correction depends on the wavelength band that is used .",
    "for example , uv continuum luminosity is usually used to infer sfr in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "it is very sensitive to the attenuation / reddening .",
    "calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that the extinction to emission lines and to stellar continuum in optical band are different , and the continuum reddening is only about 40 percent of that for emission lines .",
    "however , the extinction to uv continuum is likely similar to the hii  region because uv continuum is also emitted by young hot stars , which are likely surrounded by hiiregions . as a result",
    ", our results may be used to estimate the reddening for these high - redshift galaxies with caution , that the metallicity should be well - calibrated and be within the range covered by our sample . following equation  [ eq : powfit ] and the discussions in section  [ sec : relation ] , sfr in luminous star formation or high metallicity galaxies might have been under - estimated ( e.g. heckman et al . 1998 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2001 ; panuzzo et al .",
    "2007 ) , or those galaxies are even completely lost in optical surveys .",
    "the quantitative relationship of reddening with the metallicity , luminosity or surface brightness , and the inclination for disc galaxies can also be incorporated into the current semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. croton et al .",
    "2006 ; de lucia et al . 2004 ; kang et al .",
    "2005 ) . in those models ,",
    "a simple chemical enrichment scheme has been included , and the metal abundance has been actually predicted . with the known metallicity and the star formation rate ( intrinsic luminosity ) provided by the models ,",
    "the reddening can be estimated accurately with our formulae , and then used to shape the spectral energy distribution and predict the emerging luminosity more realistically .",

    "<S> we present empirical relations between the global dust reddening and other physical galaxy properties including the h@xmath0  luminosity , h@xmath0  surface brightness , metallicity and axial ratio for star - forming disc galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the study is based on a large sample of @xmath1 22 000 well - defined star - forming galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reddening parameterized by color excess @xmath2  is derived from the balmer decrement . </S>",
    "<S> besides the dependency of reddening on h@xmath0luminosity / surface brightness and gas phase metallicity , it is also correlated with the galaxy inclination , in the sense that edge - on galaxies are more attenuated than face - on galaxies at a give intrinsic luminosity . in light of these correlations , we present the empirical formulae of @xmath2  as a function of these galaxy properties , with a scatter of only 0.07 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical relation can be reproduced if most dust attenuation to the hii  region is due to diffuse interstellar dust distributing in a disc thicker than that of hii  regions . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical formulae can be incorporated into semi - analytical models of galaxy formation and evolution to estimate the dust reddening and enable comparison with observations more practically .    </S>",
