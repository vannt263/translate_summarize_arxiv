    "the study of nonequilibrium phase transitions in systems with absorbing phases is an active area of research in statistical physics with applications in various other fields such as chemistry , biology and social sciences @xcite .",
    "the classification of the types of phase transitions found in these systems into universality classes is , nevertheless , still an incomplete task .    the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class is the most common nonequilibrium universality class @xcite .",
    "directed percolation was indeed found to describe the critical behavior of a wide range of systems , despite the differences in their microscopic dynamic rules .",
    "however , the presence of some conservation laws and/or symmetries in the dynamics has been found to lead to other universality classes @xcite .    the pair contact process ( pcp)@xcite is one of the models whose ( steady state ) critical properties belong to the dp universality class .",
    "if the model is generalized to include single particle diffusion ( pcpd or annihilation / fission model @xcite ) , a qualitatively distinct situation arises since states with only isolated particles are no longer frozen and the question was raised of whether this would modify the universality class .",
    "a field theoretical study of the annihilation / fission model was presented long ago @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it relies on a perturbative renormalization group analysis which breaks down in spatial dimensions @xmath6 so that the active phase and the phase transition are inaccessible to this study .",
    "the upper critical dimension @xmath7 is @xmath8 for this bosonic theory , where multiple site occupancy is allowed , contrary to the usual lattice models and monte carlo simulations .",
    "a fermionic field theory is not available but it is expected to lead to @xmath9 @xcite  therefore mean field predictions , with some logarithmic corrections , would be seen in @xmath10 if the latter is the correct theory .",
    "monte carlo , coherent anomaly @xcite and dmrg studies @xcite of the @xmath11 pcpd proved to be rather hard due to very long relaxation times and important corrections to scaling .",
    "several hypothesis were put forward in order to classify its critical behavior : single type @xcite versus two regions of different behavior @xcite , parity conserving ( pc ) class @xcite , mean field behavior , diffusion - dependent exponents .",
    "some related models were also studied @xcite with the aim of identifying the relevant features which determine the critical properties .",
    "the matter is not yet fully clarified , but it seems more likely that this system belongs to a distinct , not previously encountered , universality class . park _",
    "et al _ @xcite have also pointed out that the _ binary _ character of the particle creation mechanism , rather than parity conservation , might be the crucial factor determining the type of critical behavior of pcpd .",
    "higher dimensional studies of pcpd - like models are thus necessary in order to clarify their universal properties and thus contribute to a full understanding of the nonequilibrium phase transitions puzzle .    in the present work",
    "we have studied a two - dimensional model where particle diffusion competes with binary creation and annihilation of pairs of particles .",
    "the model is described in the following section .",
    "cluster mean field studies are presented in section iii and monte carlo simulations are discussed in section iv .",
    "finally we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "the sites of a square lattice of side @xmath12 are either occupied by a particle ( @xmath13 ) or empty ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the following dynamic rules are then performed sequentially .",
    "a particle is selected at random and i ) with probability @xmath0 is moved to a ( randomly chosen ) empty neighbor site ; with the complementary probability , and provided the particle has at least one occupied neighbor , then ii ) the two particles annihilate with probability @xmath15 or iii ) with probability @xmath16 two particles are added at vacant neighbors of the initial particle .",
    "the selection of neighbors is always done with equal probabilities ; the updating is aborted and another particle is selected , if the chosen sites are not empty / occupied as required by the process . in reaction - diffusion language one has @xmath17 it is clear that , in the absence of particle diffusion ( @xmath5 ) , only sites which belong to a pair of occupied neighbors are active . in terms of pairs  taken as redefined particles  we have a _ unary _ process where particles are destroyed at rate @xmath15 or give birth to new particles at rate @xmath16 ; the number of offsprings is greater or equal to two  because new pairs may also be formed with next nearest neighbor particles  and parity of the number of particles is not conserved .",
    "this is similar to the pcp and one expects to see a phase transition , in the dp universality class , between an active phase with a finite density of pairs ( at low @xmath15 ) and an absorbing phase without pairs ( for @xmath18 ) .",
    "when particle diffusion is included , one has a qualitatively different situation , since configurations with only lonely particles are no longer absorbing  the only absorbing states are the empty lattice and the configurations with a single particle .",
    "there is parity conservation in terms of particles and the creation and annihilation mechanisms are _ binary_.",
    "the nature of the phase transition , expected to occur at some value @xmath19 , is investigated below .",
    "we performed @xmath20-cluster mean - field calculations @xcite for this model .",
    "since the details of the dynamics will not influence the values of the mean field critical indices , we have considered a simpler one dimensional version of the model where the creation takes place at the nearest and next - nearest sites to one side of the mother particle .    at the site",
    "( @xmath21 ) level , the evolution of the particle density @xmath22 ( denoted by @xmath23 in @xcite ) can be expressed as @xmath24 which has a stationary solution @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "the pair density @xmath27 ( @xmath28 in @xcite notation ) is just the square of @xmath22 at this level .",
    "for @xmath29 the densities behave as @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 leading order singularities . at the critical point @xmath33 which implies the leading order",
    "scaling is @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , while in the absorbing phase @xmath37 all these exponents coincide with those found for the pcpd model @xcite at the same level of approximation .    in the pair ( @xmath38 ) approximation ,",
    "the density of 1 @xmath22 and the 11 pair density @xmath27 are independent quantities .",
    "one can easily check that the evolution of particles can be expressed as @xmath39 while the evolution of pairs @xmath40 owing to the nonlinearities , we could not solve these equations analytically and had to look for numerical solutions .",
    "the critical indices thus obtained at different diffusion rates @xmath0 are shown in table [ tab23 ] .",
    "as we can see , there are two distinct regions . for @xmath41 @xmath42",
    "is constant and @xmath32 , while for @xmath43 @xmath42 varies with @xmath0 and @xmath44 .",
    "all these results are in complete agreement with those of the pcpd model in the pair approximation .    in the @xmath45 level approximation the situation changes ,",
    "as we can see in table [ tab23 ] : the two distinct regions for @xmath46 disappear and @xmath32 everywhere as found in the site approximation . at @xmath5 , however , the particle density does not vanish at the transition but goes to @xmath47 .",
    "this means that the @xmath45 level approximation is already capable to describe the absorbing state that contains frozen , isolated particles . for @xmath48 , @xmath49 with @xmath31 , the same critical exponent as the order parameter ( the pair density )",
    "therefore we redefine eq.(4 ) now .",
    "these results are also in agreement with those of the pcp model @xcite .",
    ".summary of @xmath50 approximation results[tab23 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have investigated the phase transition of a two dimensional binary spreading model exhibiting parity conservation . in what concerns cluster mean - field approaches , the results are similar to those of the pcpd model at the corresponding level of approximation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38 results suggest two different universality classes depending on the diffusion strength .",
    "higher ( @xmath2 ) order cluster mean - field show a single universality class characterized by @xmath31 and @xmath35 . comparing these with other recent results for pcp - like models and with the simulations , we believe that the @xmath38 case yields spurious results",
    " although two universality classes were apparently observed in a study of the one dimensional pcpd @xcite  and so @xmath1 cluster approximations are necessary to describe the mean - field singularity correctly .",
    "this is not surprising and was already found in similar models @xcite .",
    "note that in both the @xmath45 and @xmath51 approximations the @xmath42 seems to have a discontinuity by approaching @xmath5 .",
    "similar discontinuity in the phase space of the pcp model was recently reported as the result of an external particle source @xcite .",
    "this behavior may be the subject of further studies .",
    "we performed extensive and detailed simulations along the phase transition line and found a single universality class with the order parameter exponents @xmath31 and @xmath52 for all @xmath46 .",
    "logarithmic corrections to scaling were detected that are weakest at @xmath53 . in the lack of a theoretical prediction , we have selected the best logarithmic fitting forms taking into account up to @xmath54 terms , but we can not rule out the possibility of other logarithmic correction forms . scaling function analysis confirmed the @xmath55 and @xmath56 mean - field values .",
    "this seems to indicate that the critical dimension is @xmath4 as predicted by the bosonic field theory . in the inactive region ,",
    "the decay of particle density at large times was found to agree with an exact prediction @xcite    the pair density @xmath27 for @xmath57 ( where the bosonic field theory breaks down ) was shown to exhibit the same singular behavior as the order parameter , apart from a logarithmic ratio .",
    "simulation results of the pcpd model @xcite found indications for similar behavior .",
    "the reason why the mean - field approximation fails to describe the singular behavior of @xmath27 is yet not clear to us but in the two - component description of the model it indicates strong coupling between pairs and particles ( similarly to other models @xcite ) . in the inactive region , however , @xmath27 and @xmath22 scale differently . at the @xmath5 endpoint of the transition line we found 2 + 1 dimensional dp critical behavior of @xmath27 with infinitely many frozen absorbing states similarly to the pcp model .    we have found identical predictions for the present and the pcpd model within mean - field , which seem to be confirmed by our simulations  and also by preliminary simulations for the @xmath58 pcpd @xcite .",
    "one thus concludes that it is very likely that parity conservation is irrelevant for this transition , as in the one - dimensional case @xcite and in certain models with exclusion @xcite .",
    "further renormalization group studies of these systems are necessary for a proper justification of these results .",
