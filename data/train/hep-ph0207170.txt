    "a precise measurement of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xcite is one of the key issues in the study of @xmath5 mesons and @xmath5 factory experiments . in particular ,",
    "the accurate determination of @xmath6 is one of the most challenging problems in @xmath5 physics .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies for probing @xmath6 have been mostly focused on the semileptonic @xmath5 meson decays .",
    "the cleo result obtained using the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath7 @xcite : ( in @xmath8 ) @xmath9 the opal data obtained using the inclusive decay @xmath10 @xcite : ( in @xmath8 ) @xmath11    in this work @xcite we study semi - inclusive charmless decays @xmath0 and investigate the possibility of extracting @xmath3 from these processes .",
    "compared to the exclusive decays , these semi - inclusive decays are generally expected to have less hadronic uncertainty and larger branching ratios .",
    "there are several possible processes in @xmath0 type decays , such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath1 does not contain a charm ( anti)quark . among these processes of the type @xmath0",
    ", we identify a certain mode , @xmath2 , whose analysis is theoretically clean and which can be used for determining @xmath3 .",
    "then , we calculate the branching ratio ( br ) of @xmath2 , and present the result as a function of @xmath3 with an estimation of possible uncertainty .",
    "we also consider the @xmath15 mixing effect through @xmath16 .",
    "among the semi - inclusive charmless @xmath0 decays , let us first consider the mode @xmath2 .",
    "contributions for the decay amplitude of this mode arise from the color - favored tree ( @xmath17 ) diagram and the @xmath18 penguin diagram , so that the tree diagram contribution dominates .",
    "the charged pion @xmath19 in the final state can be produced via a @xmath20 boson emission at tree level and is expected to be energetic ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the decay amplitude can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes a hadronization function describing the combination of the @xmath24 pair to make the final state @xmath1 . to obtain the decay rate , @xmath25",
    "should be summed over all the possible states , such as @xmath26 , @xmath27 etc , so this process is effectively a _ two_-body decay process of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , in this mode , no hadronic form factors are involved , and as a result the model - dependence and uncertainty relevant to hadronic form factors do not appear .",
    "we note that the _ energetic _ charged pion @xmath19 in the final state can be a characteristic signal for this mode .",
    "( the net electric charge of @xmath1 should be _ positive _ so that @xmath19 can not be produced in the case of @xmath29 . )",
    "now let us consider the mode @xmath30 .",
    "various contributions are responsible for this process : the color - favored tree diagram , the color - suppressed tree diagram , the @xmath18 and @xmath31 penguin diagrams . the color - favored tree contribution and one of @xmath18",
    "penguin contributions are similar to those in @xmath2 , which are effectively two - body type ( @xmath28 ) processes .",
    "but , the color - suppressed tree and other penguins differ from those in @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , these diagrams correspond to a three - body decay process of @xmath32 in the parton model approximation .",
    "the charged pion @xmath19 in the final state contains the spectator antiquark @xmath33 .",
    "so the analysis involves the hadronic form factor for the @xmath34 transition which is model - dependent .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath31 penguin contribution is not suppressed compared to the tree contributions , but dominant in this mode .",
    "therefore , compared to the case of @xmath2 , the analysis of this mode is much more complicated and involves larger uncertainty .",
    "other modes of the type @xmath0 can be similarly classified .",
    "for instance , in the mode @xmath35 , the color - favored tree ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) diagrams and the @xmath18 and @xmath31 penguin diagrams are responsible for the decay process . in this case",
    ", the charged pion @xmath19 contains the spectator quark @xmath38 so that the process is effectively a three - body decay @xmath39 and the hadronic form factor for the @xmath34 transition is involved .",
    "other processes are effectively a combination of the two - body decay process ( @xmath40 ) and the three - body decay process ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we have seen that the process @xmath2 is particularly interesting , because it is effectively the two - body decay process @xmath28 and no uncertainty from hadronic form factors is involved .",
    "thus , its theoretical analysis is expected to be quite clean .",
    "we calculate the br of the process @xmath2 , where @xmath1 can contain an up quark and a down antiquark .",
    "we use the effective hamiltonian and the effective wilson coefficients given in ref .",
    "the br can be expressed as a polynomial of @xmath3 : @xmath42 where for convenience we have scaled @xmath3 by the factor 0.004 ( the central value of the opal data ) .",
    "+ figure 1 .",
    "the branching ratio ( in @xmath4 ) versus @xmath43 for @xmath2 decay .",
    "@xmath44 has been calculated using @xmath45 and is denoted by the bold solid line .",
    "the solid , dotted , and dashed lines correspond to @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "+   + in figure 1 , we present the br of @xmath2 as a function of the effective number of color @xmath43 for three different values of the cp phase angle @xmath47 . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are independent of @xmath50 , and only @xmath51 depends on @xmath50 .",
    "three different lines for @xmath51 correspond to the relevant values of @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "it is clearly shown that @xmath48 is dominant .",
    "an reperesentative value of @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 is shown as the bold solid line in the figure .",
    "the value of @xmath52 does not vary much as @xmath43 varies .",
    "+ figure 2 . the branching ratio ( in @xmath4 ) versus @xmath3 for @xmath2 decay .",
    "the solid and the dotted line correspond to the smallest and the largest value of @xmath52 in the given parameter space , respectively .",
    "+   + in figure 2 , the br of @xmath2 is presented as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we vary the value of @xmath43 and @xmath50 in a reasonable range : from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , and from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "the solid and the dotted line correspond to the smallest and the largest value of @xmath52 in the given parameter space , respectively .",
    "the br is an order of @xmath4 . for the given @xmath3 , the br @xmath52",
    "is estimated with a relatively small error ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "reversely , for the given ( i.e. , experimentally measured ) br @xmath52 , the value of @xmath3 can be determined with a small error ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "( of course , since in a practical experiment the br would be measured with some errors , @xmath3 could be determined with larger error : e.g. , for @xmath61 , our result expects @xmath62 . )    using the decay process @xmath2 , one may need to consider the @xmath15 mixing effect : @xmath16 .",
    "the neutral @xmath63 has about @xmath64 probability of decaying as the opposite flavor @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "it turns out @xcite that even considering the effect from the @xmath15 mixing , our result holds with resonable accuracy .",
    "we have shown that among semi - inclusive charmless @xmath0 decays , the process @xmath2 is particularly interesting and one can determine @xmath3 with reasonable accuracy , by measuring the br of @xmath2 .",
