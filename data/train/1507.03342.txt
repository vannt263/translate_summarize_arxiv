    "the behavior of sodium spectral features has garnered much attention as it has become known that some galaxies show enhanced  doublet strengths at 5890 and 5896   and enhanced 1  doublet strengths at 8183 and 8195 .",
    "numerous studies have been performed over the last three decades to understand these lines , but it is still unclear exactly how some galaxies exhibit a sodium excess .",
    "recent research focused on variation of an initial mass function ( imf ) has provided an interesting possibility .",
    "the stellar imf is usually considered a universal function , but the possibility of a non - universal imf has been raised by several authors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in studies on the caii triplet at 8500",
    ", @xcite found an anti - correlation between the strength of the caii triplet region and the velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies and concluded that bottom - heavy imfs are favored ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite reported observing a near - infrared 1  doublet in the spectra of massive early - type galaxies , and claimed that these excesses can be explained by a bottom - heavy imf ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that massive early - type galaxies should possess relatively more low - mass stars .",
    "an alternative solution is also possible .",
    "it is well known that the  feature is sensitive to na - enhancement ( [ na / fe ] ) .",
    "the discovery of non - solar abundance patterns in early - type galaxies was first made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found extreme enhancement of  and  features with respect to calcium and iron peaks , and concluded that this was a result of higher metal abundance .",
    "@xcite also claimed that strong na features are caused by an overabundance of [ na / fe ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this is a trivial interpretation and thus not satisfying unless the origin for the enhancement is given clearly .",
    "furthermore , ism could also increase the  line strength . until the early 1980s it",
    "was thought that only late - type galaxies had significant ism .",
    "advances in x - ray and radio astronomy , however , have demonstrated that many early - type galaxies also have an unignorable amount of ism .",
    "a direct method of measuring hydrogen gas column densities to detect ism is possible via spectroscopy in the ultraviolet , because observations between 70 and 1000  are sensitive to small amounts of hydrogen and helium in the ism .",
    "if it is not easy to obtain such data because of instrumental limitations ; an alternative way is to use absorption lines such as ki , caii , and 1  in the more accessible optical region of the spectrum .",
    "the  absorption lines , especially , provides a good probe of cold ism in the outflow . according to @xcite ,  absorption arises from cool gas in the disk and a blueshifted  absorption",
    "is frequently detected in star - forming galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to understand the origin of the  excess , jeong et al .",
    "( 2013 ; j13 hereafter ) explored the properties of  excess objects ( neos ) from the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) , with morphological information obtained through visual inspection of galaxy images .",
    "they found the use of bottom - heavy imf not capable of reproducing the observed strength of na d lines much but instead found it necessary to evoke an _ ad hoc _ enhancement of na ( [ na / fe@xmath0\\,\\sim\\,0.3 $ ] ) , just as in @xcite .",
    "their work does not necessarily rule out the possibility of a bottom - heavy imf but hints that there is another missing physics that controls the na d strengths more importantly ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed ,",
    "weak lensing studies ( spiniello et al . 2012 ; spiniello , trager & koopman 2015 ) suggest that a bottom - heavy imf ( similar to the original salpeter imf ) helps reproducing the high values of mass derived on lensing galaxies , while the use of na enhancement was additionally required .",
    "@xcite also found that little dust extinction seems present in smooth - looking _ early - type _ neos quoting the ossy database @xcite , which supports the interpretation of stellar ( rather than ism ) origin for the na strength excess .",
    "as a further confirmation test , we hereby present the result of doppler measurement on the shape of  lines for the j13 samples of neos .",
    "if the  excess is related to ism , we may detect doppler components in  line shapes due to gaseous outflows in actively star - forming galaxies @xcite or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "the parent sample for this study is the neos from j13 .",
    "the j13 sample is drawn from the sdss dr7 in the redshift range 0.00@xmath1@xmath2@xmath10.08 by applying an absolute @xmath3-band magnitude cut - off of @xmath420.5 to obtain a volume - limited sample and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) cut - off of 20 to guarantee high quality spectroscopic data . to find neos , j13 defined a new index , , which quantifies the  excess as follows : @xmath5 where ( observed ) is the observed  line strength and ( model ) is the expected model  line strength .",
    "@xmath6 0.5 is used as a criterion for the  excess , and 0.0 @xmath1  @xmath1 0.1 is used to create a control sample .",
    "the sample galaxies were then morphologically classified via visual inspection .",
    "the neos were carefully assigned to four classes : ( 1 ) ordinary early - type galaxies ( oetgs ) , ( 2 ) peculiar early - type galaxies ( petgs ) , ( 3 ) ordinary late - type galaxies ( oltgs ) , and ( 4 ) peculiar late - type galaxies ( pltgs ) .",
    "we note that galaxies with asymmetric features and dust patches ( or lanes ) are classified as peculiar types . in the case of control",
    "sample galaxies , these are simply divided into two categories : early - type galaxies ( cetg ) and late - type galaxies ( cltg ) .",
    "the details of the sample are described more fully in section  2 of j13 .    )",
    "are shown here .",
    "the error bars indicate 1@xmath7 scatter in the sample .",
    "red lines show the stacked sed of their corresponding fits.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     but based on voigt fitting .",
    "note that voigt profiles reproduce the shapes of the  lines much better.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , we assume that if  excess has ism - origin ,  absorption line would be blueshifted by the effect of outflow such as galactic superwind or agn outflow . it is known that an  doublet is a good tracer of cold ism in the outflow . in order to measure the doppler component , we tried both gaussian and voigt functions to fit each galaxy spectrum near the nad absorption lines . note that we fit the  line profile with two gaussian ( or voigt ) profiles .",
    "a possible criticism is that our fits are mainly mathematical rather than physical .",
    "however , it is the simplest method that can be used just to investigate whether neos show a blueshift doppler departure from the bulk of the stellar population or not .",
    "we first adopted two gaussian profiles to fit each galaxy spectrum and reproduce the shapes of the  doublet lines using the following formula : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath7 represent the line depth and width of the  absorption feature , respectively , and @xmath10 is the position of the centroid . for fitting ,",
    "we assume that the line widths ( @xmath7 ) of the two gaussian profiles are the same because they originated from the same galaxy , and two pseudo - continuum band - passes of  are identified as [ 5860.625  5875.625 ] and [ 5922.125  5948.125 ] from @xcite . to measure the doppler components ,",
    "the quality of our fits to the observed spectra is important .",
    "therefore , we calculated a reduced @xmath11 ( ) near the two dips , and only galaxies with  @xmath12 are included in our final sample .",
    "figure [ fig : gaussian ] shows the observed stacked spectra ( black solid lines ) of early - type neos ( etg ) and early - type control sample galaxies ( cetg ) in the  region . for comparison ,",
    "we stacked their gaussian fits ( red solid lines ) .",
    "the models match the observed spectra well near the two dips , but there is a marked discrepancy in the fit on the sides ( wings ) .",
    "one might be tempted to interpret this mismatch as an outflow effect , but if this interpretation is followed , then the same result in the early - type control sample is not explainable .",
    "some lines like ca ii h and k , cai at 4227 , , and mgb show strong pressure - broadened wings in the spectra of cool stars .",
    "it is known that the voigt profile is particularly well suited to fit the wings of such lines .",
    "the voigt profile is defined by a convolution of the gaussian and lorentizan functions : @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is @xmath16 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 denote the depth and width of the gaussian component , @xmath10 is the position of the centroid , and @xmath17 corresponds to the width of the lorentzian component .",
    "the shape of the voigt profile is highly sensitive to the value of @xmath17 , so we defined @xmath15 as @xmath16 to restrict the @xmath17 contribution to only the width of the wings .",
    "we then adopted two voigt profiles to fit the  doublet for each galaxy spectrum , using the following form : @xmath18 observed stacked spectra ( black solid lines ) of early - type neos ( etg ) and early - type control sample galaxies ( cetg ) with their stacked fits ( red solid lines ) obtained using two voigt profiles are shown in figure [ fig : voigt ] .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show different numbers of galaxies mainly because they show only the galaxies for which @xmath19 was achieved to be better than 3.0 while this cut depends on the fitting method .",
    "in addition , we excluded some fits even if chi squared was small when the fits required the positions of the fitting centroids to be farther than 0.5  from the pre - assumed positions of the doublets .",
    "some displacement of centroids was allowed in the fitting procedure because of the limited spectral resolution and the uncertainty in redshift determination .",
    "given that the result based on the gaussian fitting shows a marked discrepancy in the fit ( see figure  [ fig : gaussian ] ) , the voigt fitting reproduces the shapes of the  lines in a markedly better way , especially for the wings in the spectra .",
    "for a sanity check , the mean value of the width ( dispersion ) in the gaussian component ( @xmath7 in equation  [ eq : voigt2 ] ) is 150@xmath2050 km s@xmath21 , which roughly corresponds to the typical value of velocity dispersion of galaxies .    to compare the gaussian and voigt fitting methods , we show the fit residuals of our sample galaxies according to their morphologies in figure  [ fig : residual ] .",
    "it should be noted that the fit residual based on the voigt fitting method ( solid lines ) is below 1%   except in the hei region at 5875 , while the gaussian fitting method fails to reproduce the wings of  even for the control sample ( see cetg and cltg cases ) .",
    "the broadening of absorption lines is difficult to interpret because the physics of the curve of growth is complex .",
    "thus , we focus instead on the blueshift doppler departure from the bulk of the stellar population due to outflow caused by either star formation or agn activity by measuring the centroids of the lines . as shown in section [ sec : method ] , voigt profiles provide conspicuously better fits to spectra , so we exploit results of voigt profile fitting in our final analysis . to measure the doppler component of the   absorption lines , we define as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and 5891.6 are the left - dip positions of the best - fit for each galaxy and the  absorption lines in vacuum , respectively . if the line shows a blueshift doppler departure from the bulk of the stellar population , @xmath24 has a negative value .",
    "figure  [ fig : mu_vs_nad ] presents the amount of  absorption line shift with respect to the  line strength . to investigate the dominant process that causes this outflow component",
    ", we use the bpt classification information from j13 : star - forming ( sf ) , composite ( i.e. , hosting both star formation and agn activity , co ) , seyfert ( se ) , liner ( li ) , or non - emission line galaxies ( ne ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath24 distributions of the control sample are shown in gray bands ( panels g and h ) for easy comparison . the key point in this investigation",
    "is to check whether the neos are so significantly different in the line shift compared with the control sample or not .",
    "the left panels of figure  [ fig : mu_vs_nad ] show the early - type cases : ordinary ( smooth - looking ) early - type neos ( oetg , a ) , peculiar ( non - smooth ) early - type neos ( petg , c ) , early - type neos ( oetg+petg , e ) , and early - type control sample ( cetg , g ) .",
    "a cursory glance at this diagram shows that most early - type neos do not seem to show any particular blueshift of the  absorption lines .",
    "the fraction showing a shift bluer than those of the control counterparts ( @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath40.6 ) is roughly 4% ( 17/412 , panel e ) .",
    "this result implies that ism and dust are not likely the main factors causing the increase of the   line strength of early - type neos .",
    "a possible criticism can be made by asking whether the non - shifted  absorption line provides direct evidence of non - ism .",
    "it is known that there should also be a sign of dust extinction to allow neutral sodium to survive in the ism .",
    "this implies that , if the  line strength of early - type neos is significantly enhanced through ism effects , these galaxies are more likely to show a correlation between dust extinction and  line strength .",
    "however , j13 found that there was no correlation between the @xmath26 values and . on the contrary ,",
    "the strongest early - type neos were the ones with the lowest dust extinction .",
    "it is also worth noting that almost all of the ordinary early - type neos ( oetgs , panel a ) have overall ranges of @xmath24 similar to those of the control sample ( cetg , panel g ) .",
    "for example , the mean values of @xmath24 for oetg and cetg are 0.87@xmath200.68 and 0.78@xmath200.65 , respectively .",
    "however , one liner agn galaxy below the band is notable .",
    "if a galaxy reveals strong emission lines , this galaxy may be a gaseous system .",
    "so , there is the potential for this galaxy to show the  excess through ism effects and to reveal a notable doppler component in  lines due to agn - powered outflows .",
    "the physical mechanism by which an agn could drive molecular gas out of a galaxy is still debated .",
    "therefore , a detailed study of this galaxy using integral - field spectroscopy to constrain the outflow parameters and ionization mechanisms can shed light on the mechanism of gas expulsion from the galaxy and of quenching of star formation in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ fig : mu_vs_nad ] show the late - type cases .",
    "in contrast to early - type neos , 27% of our late - type neos ( 78/286 , ltg ) clearly show blueshift in their  lines in comparison with their control sample ( cltg ) .",
    "furthermore , the overall distribution of late - type neos ( panel f ) is shifted toward more negative values than the distribution of the control sample ( panel h ) .",
    "for example , the mean values of @xmath24 for ltg and cltg are @xmath27 and 0.35@xmath200.68 , respectively .",
    "this strongly implies that these galaxies have an outflow component .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : all_sample ]    *  notes . *    we checked the bpt classification for the 78 late - type neos with blueshifted  lines .",
    "of 78 , 41 and 30 galaxies are star - forming ( sf ) and composite ( co ) galaxies , respectively , and only 5 galaxies are agns .",
    "such findings suggest that the  excess found in these galaxies is related with star formation - caused gaseous outflows ( galactic winds ) , which play an important role in the evolution of galaxies by removing / heating of cold gas in galaxies .",
    "we thus conclude that early - type neos and late - type neos have completely different mechanisms underlying their  excess .",
    "many late - type neos clearly show blueshift in their  lines , which means that their  excess is related with ism . on the other hand ,",
    "early - type neos do not show any significant doppler component . while this does not necessarily rule out a possibility of ism origin",
    ", it would be much more natural to conclude that their excessive  is of stellar origin . to facilitate follow - up observations of these exciting objects",
    ", we provide a catalog of the sample galaxies presented in this paper in table  [ tab : all_sample ] .",
