    "as part of our investigation of the luminosity - metallicity relation of the rr lyrae stars in @xmath0  cen , we have obtained @xmath1 and @xmath2 & strmgren ccd frames with the ctio 0.9 m telescope that cover 40 @xmath3 40 @xmath4 in a 3 @xmath3 3 grid centered on the cluster . as a byproduct of this investigation , we obtained high - quality homogeneous @xmath1 color - magnitude ( cm ) data for more than 130,000 stars in the field toward @xmath0  cen , which represents the most extensive photometric survey to date for this cluster as far as the stars brighter than the main - sequence ( ms ) turnoff are concerned .",
    "this study ( lee et al . 1999 ) has shown , for the first time , that @xmath0  cen has several distinct stellar populations , which is reminiscent of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( layden & sarajedini 1997 ) .",
    "this feature was later confirmed by pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) from their independent photometry . in this paper",
    ", we present our progress in more detailed analysis of the data along with the population models .",
    "figure 1 presents @xmath1 cm diagram for all stars in our program field including rr lyrae variable stars . we were able to remove some foreground galactic disk star contamination , as they are well discriminated from more metal - poor member stars of @xmath0  cen in the analysis based on our @xmath2 & strmgren @xmath5 photometry",
    "( see rey et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "here we confirm our previous discovery that the red - giant - branch ( rgb ) of @xmath0  cen has four distinct populations : the most metal - poor sequence , metal - poor sequence , metal - rich sequence , and the most metal - rich sequence well separated from others .",
    "we believe this is a clear evidence for the multiple stellar populations in @xmath0  cen .",
    "the horizontal - branch ( hb ) distribution is also consistent with the discrete nature of rgb .",
    "we have the blue hb and rr lyrae variables mainly associated with the two metal - poor rgbs , some red hb stars associated with the metal - rich population , and finally the red clump superimposed on the rgb , which must be associated with the most metal - rich population .",
    "the presence of multiple stellar populations in @xmath0  cen is confirmed by our population models ( figure 2 ; see also ree et al . , this volume ) .",
    "our models are constructed based on the @xmath6 isochrones ( yi et al .",
    "2001 ) and corresponding hb evolutionary tracks ( yi , demarque , & kim 1997 ) calculated with updated input physics . the reader is referred to lee , demarque , & zinn ( 1994 ) and park & lee ( 1997 ) for the details of model constructions . from the population models , we confirm four distinct populations with different metallicities can reproduce the observed discrete nature of the rgb .",
    "the models also confirm that the rr lyrae variables are mainly produced by two metal - poor populations , with some contribution from the 2nd most metal - rich population .    for the rr lyrae stars in @xmath0  cen",
    ", we have new metallicity measurements from our @xmath2 & strmgren @xmath5 photometry ( see rey et al . ,",
    "this volume ) , and therefore more detailed comparison with the models is possible . from the luminosity - metallicity relation and the period - shift ",
    "metallicity correlation of the rr lyrae variables in @xmath0  cen , we confrim that our models reproduce even the fine details within the instability strip , including the sudden upturn of the rr lyrae luminosity and corresponding increase in period - shift at [ fe / h ] @xmath7 -1.5 , which is a result of redward evolution from the blue hb ( see rey et al . ,",
    "this volume ; yoon & lee , this volume ) .",
    "this suggests we have a very good understanding of what is happening in the instability strip of @xmath0  cen .",
    "our models also reproduce the red clump associated with the most metal - rich rgb , but only when the age of the most metal - rich population is some 4 gyr younger than the most metal - poor population .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 , where we can see the variation of the red clump location in the cm diagram under different assumptions regarding the age difference betwen the most metal - rich and the most metal - poor populations . by comparing these models with the observed color of the red clump , which is estimated from the analysis of the luminosity functions of the rgbs superimposed on the red clump",
    "( see rey et al .",
    ", this volume ) , we conclude that the @xmath8 t of @xmath7 4 gyrs is our best estimate for the age spread within the @xmath0  cen , in the sense that the metal - rich population is younger .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the results obtained directly from the strmgren photometry of main - sequence stars ( hughes & wallerstein 2000 ; hilker & richtler 2000 ) , although these results are subject to large errors associated with the photometry and metallicity groupings .",
    "these unusual characteristics of @xmath0  cen are very similar to the case of sagittarius dwarf galaxy , which is in the process of disruption with the milky way ( ibata , gilmore , & irwin 1994 ) . in figure 4 , we have compared our population models with the observations centered on the m54 ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ) , which is believed to be the nucleus of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy .",
    "note again that the blue hb is from the most metal - poor ( and older ) population , the red hb is from the intermediate metallicity population , and finally the red clump is from the most metal - rich ( and younger ) population .",
    "we confrim here that the sagittarius dwarf galaxy also has several distinct stellar populations with the internal age - metallicity relation that spans @xmath7 7 gyrs .",
    "other local group dwarf galaxies are also known to have similarly complex star formation histories ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "the multiple populations and the internal age - metallicity relation found in our work ( and also suggested by others in this workshop ) , which resemble the characteristics of sagittarius dwarf galaxy , suggest @xmath0  cen was massive enough for self - enrichment and several bursts of star formation . the relatively extended enrichment period of @xmath7 4 gyrs then indicates that the initial evolution of @xmath0  cen occured away from the dense central regions of young milky way , because , near the galactic center like the current location of @xmath0  cen , we would expect the gaseous materials to have been stripped from the proto @xmath0  cen on a much shorter timescale as a result of disk shocking and/or similar processes .",
    "this view is not inconsistent with @xmath0  cen s rather unusual kinematics and orbit ( dinescu , this volume ) .    from the discrete nature of rgb",
    ", some may suggest that the @xmath0  cen could be a merger of several globular clusters .",
    "but mergers of ( at least ) four clusters are very unlikely , if not impossible , in the milky way , considering the rather high velocities between the clusters in the halo",
    ". we can not rule out this scenario in dwarf galaxies , however , because internal velocity dispersion is much lower in dwarf galaxies ( van den bergh 1996 ) .",
    "all of these information strongly suggest that the @xmath0  cen is a relict or a nucleus of a disrupted dwarf galaxy .",
    "the case of @xmath0  cen and that of the sagittarius dwarf system therefore provide direct evidence for past and continuing accretion of protogalactic fragments , which suggest that similar accretion events may have continued throughout the history of milky way formation .",
    "it is interesting to note that two globular clusters , now identified as the nuclei or parts of disrupted dwarf galaxies , are among the most massive globular clusters in the milky way .",
    "@xmath0  cen is , of course , the most massive globular cluster , and m54 , the nucleus of the sagittarius dwarf , is the 2nd most massive globular cluster .",
    "then , how about the other massive globular clusters ?",
    "there are several galactic globular clusters that resemble @xmath0  cen , but among them , we found the cases of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 are the most interesting .",
    "they are 3rd and 5th most massive globular clusters , respectively , and they all have very peculair bimodal hb distributions .",
    "our population models for these unusual clusters show that the adoption of two distinct populations within the systems and very mild internal age - metallicity relations between the two populations can reproduce the observed features on the hb and rgb ( see ree et al . ,",
    "this volume ) .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the fact that the mean period of rr lyrae variables in these clusters are too long for their high metallicities , which is understood in two populations secnario , where the rr lyraes are highly evolved stars from the older and metal - poor blue hb population ( see ree et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "our conclusion on the origin of @xmath0  cen and other massive globular clusters , when combined with other recent findings on the origin of galactic globular cluster system , suggest that the present day galactic globular clusters are infact subdivided into three different types :      \\(b ) clusters originally formed in satellite dwarf galaxies later accreted to the milky way .",
    "they include globular clusters ( pal  12 , ter  7 , ter  8 , & arp  2 ) belong to sagittarius dwarf galaxy , and young outer halo clusters with retrograde motion ( zinn 1993 ; van den bergh 1993 ) .",
    "yoon & lee ( this volume ) also reported very compelling evidence that metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath9 -2.0 ) oosterhoff ii clusters have the positional and orbital characteristics fully consistent with the hypothesis that they were originated from a satellite galaxy .",
    "\\(c ) nuclei ( or relicts ) of disrupted dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xmath0  cen and m54 , the nucleus of the sagittarius dwarf , are undoubtedly belong to this type .",
    "our population models ( ree et al . , this volume ) suggest other massive globular clusters with bimodal hbs ( e.g. , ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ) may also belong to this category .",
