    "( alternatively , _ empty convex polygon _ ) of @xmath0 is a convex polygon with vertices in @xmath0 , containing no points of @xmath0 in its interior .",
    "questions about ( empty or nonempty ) convex polygons in point sets are of fundamental importance in discrete and computational geometry .",
    "a landmark in this area is the question posed by erds and szekeres in 1935  @xcite : `` what is the smallest integer @xmath4 such that any set of @xmath4 points in the plane contains at least one convex @xmath5-gon ? '' .",
    "a variant later proposed by erds himself asks for the existence of empty convex polygons  @xcite : `` determine the smallest positive integer @xmath6 , if it exists , such that any set @xmath7 of at least @xmath6 points in general position in the plane contains @xmath2 points which are the vertices of an empty convex polygon , i.e. , a polygon whose interior does not contain any point of @xmath7 . ''",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "harborth  @xcite proved that @xmath10 .",
    "much more recently , nicols  @xcite and independently gerken  @xcite proved that every sufficiently large point set contains an empty convex hexagon ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it is currently known that @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "a celebrated construction of horton  @xcite shows that for each @xmath12 , @xmath6 does not exist .",
    "for further results and references around erds - szekeres type problems , we refer the reader to the surveys  @xcite and to the monography  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the expected size of convex structures in random point sets .",
    "this gives rise to a combination of erds - szekeres type problems with variants of sylvester s seminal question  @xcite : `` what is the probability that four random points chosen independently and uniformly from a convex region form a convex quadrilateral ? ''",
    "several fundamental questions have been attacked ( and solved ) in this direction ; see for instance  @xcite . particularly relevant to our work are the results of valtr , who computed exactly the probability that @xmath2 random points independently and uniformly chosen from a parallelogram  @xcite or a triangle  @xcite are in convex position .",
    "consider a bounded convex region @xmath1 , and randomly choose @xmath2 points independently and uniformly over @xmath1 .",
    "we are interested in estimating the expected _ size _ ( that is , number of vertices ) of the largest convex hole of such a randomly generated point set .",
    "some related questions are heavily dependent on the shape of @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the expected number of vertices in the convex hull of a random point set , which is @xmath13 if @xmath1 is the interior of a polygon , and @xmath14 if @xmath1 is the interior of a convex figure with a smooth boundary ( such as a disk )  @xcite . in the problem under consideration , it turns out that the order of magnitude of the expected number of vertices of the largest convex hole is independent of the shape of @xmath1 :    [ thm : ferr1 ] let @xmath1 and @xmath15 be bounded convex regions in the plane .",
    "let @xmath16 ( respectively , @xmath17 ) be a set of @xmath2 points chosen independently and uniformly at random from @xmath1 ( respectively , @xmath15 ) .",
    "let @xmath18 ( respectively , @xmath19 denote the random variable that measures the number of vertices of the largest convex hole in @xmath16 ( respectively , @xmath17 ) . then @xmath20 moreover , w.h.p .",
    "@xmath21    we remark that theorem  [ thm : ferr1 ] is in line with the following result proved by brny and fredi  @xcite : the expected number of empty simplices in a set of @xmath2 points chosen uniformly and independently at random from a convex set @xmath22 with non - empty interior in @xmath23 is @xmath24 , regardless of the shape of @xmath22 .",
    "using theorem  [ thm : ferr1 ] , we have determined the expected number of vertices of a largest convex hole up to a constant multiplicative factor :    [ thm : hole0 ] let @xmath1 be a bounded convex region in the plane .",
    "let @xmath16 be a set of @xmath2 points chosen independently and uniformly at random from @xmath1 , and let @xmath18 denote the random variable that measures the number of vertices of the largest convex hole in @xmath16",
    ". then @xmath25 moreover , w.h.p .",
    "@xmath26    for the proof of theorem  [ thm : hole0 ] , in both the lower and upper bounds we use powerful results of valtr , who computed precisely the probability that @xmath2 points chosen at random ( from a triangle  @xcite or from a parallelogram  @xcite ) are in convex position .",
    "the proof of the lower bound is quite simple : we partition a unit area square @xmath1 ( in view of theorem  [ thm : ferr1 ] , it suffices to establish theorem  [ thm : hole0 ] for a square ) into @xmath27 rectangles such that each of them contains exactly @xmath28 points , where @xmath29 . using  @xcite , with high probability in at least one of the regions the points are in convex position , forming a convex hole .",
    "the proof of the upper bound is more involved .",
    "we put an @xmath2 by @xmath2 lattice in the unit square .",
    "the first key idea is that any sufficiently large convex hole @xmath30 can be well - approximated with _ lattice _",
    "quadrilaterals @xmath31 ( that is , their vertices are lattice points ) such that @xmath32 ( see proposition 3 ) .",
    "the key advantage of using lattice quadrilaterals is that there are only polynomially many choices ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) for each of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath30 is a hole , then @xmath34 contains no point of @xmath16 in its interior .",
    "this helps to upper estimate the area @xmath36 of @xmath34 , and at the same time @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( see claim b ) .",
    "this upper bound on @xmath38 gives that w.h.p .",
    "@xmath35 contains at most @xmath39 points of @xmath16 .",
    "conditioning that each choice of @xmath35 contains at most @xmath39 points , using valtr  @xcite ( dividing the @xmath40-gon @xmath41 into at most eight triangles ) we prove that w.h.p .",
    "@xmath35 does not contain @xmath42 points in convex position ( claim e ) , so w.h.p .",
    "there is no hole of that size .",
    "a slight complication is that @xmath35 may not lie entirely in @xmath1 ; this issue makes the proof somewhat more technical .",
    "we make two final remarks before we move on to the proofs . as in the previous paragraph , for the rest of the paper we let @xmath43 denote the area of a region @xmath44 in the plane .",
    "we also note that , throughout the paper , by @xmath45 we mean the natural logarithm of @xmath46 .",
    "since we only consider sets of points chosen independently and uniformly at random from a region , for brevity we simply say that such set points are chosen at random from this region .",
    "0.4 cm * claim . * _ for every @xmath47 and every sufficiently large @xmath2 , _",
    "@xmath48    let @xmath47 .",
    "we choose a random @xmath49-point set @xmath50 and a random @xmath2-point set @xmath16 over @xmath1 as follows : first we choose @xmath49 points randomly from @xmath1 to obtain @xmath50 , and then from @xmath50 we choose randomly @xmath2 points , to obtain @xmath16 .",
    "now if @xmath30 is a convex hole of @xmath51 with vertex set @xmath52 , then @xmath53 is the vertex set of a convex hole of @xmath16 . noting that @xmath54 , the claim follows .",
    "now the expected number of vertices of the largest convex hole in a random @xmath2-point set is the same for @xmath15 as for any set congruent to @xmath15 .",
    "thus we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath15 is contained in @xmath1 .",

    "let @xmath58 be a set of @xmath59 points randomly chosen from @xmath1 .",

    "thus the expected value of @xmath61 is @xmath62 , and a standard application of chernoff s inequality implies that with probability at least @xmath63 we have @xmath64 .",
    "conditioning on @xmath65 means that @xmath66 is a randomly chosen @xmath65-point set in @xmath15 .     since @xmath67 ,",
    "then every convex hole in @xmath68 is also a convex hole in @xmath58 , and so @xmath69 from the claim it follows that @xmath70 and that if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 .",

    "we finally note that it is standard to modify the proof to obtain that w.h.p .",

    ", we subdivide @xmath1 into a @xmath2 by @xmath2 grid ( which defines an @xmath80 by @xmath80 lattice ) , pick a largest convex hole @xmath30 , and find lattice quadrilaterals @xmath31 such that @xmath81 , whose areas are not too different from the area of @xmath30 .",
    "the caveat is that the circumscribed quadrilateral @xmath35 may not completely fit into @xmath1 ; for this reason , we need to extend this grid of area @xmath82 to a grid of area @xmath83 ( that is , to extend the @xmath80 by @xmath80 lattice to a @xmath84 by @xmath84 lattice ) .",
