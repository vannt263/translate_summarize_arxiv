    "a growing number of people are changing the way they consume news , replacing the traditional physical newspapers and magazines with their virtual online versions or / and weblogs @xcite .",
    "online news can be characterized by two key features : _",
    "interactivity _ and _ immediacy _ @xcite .",
    "_ interactivity _ relates to the fact that people tend to consume only the news they are interested in , while _ immediacy _ states that people expect to be informed about the latest news with practically no delay .",
    "these characteristics changed the way news are being produced and distributed @xcite .",
    "for instance , the news cycle ( i.e. the time lag between when a news organization becomes aware of an issue and publishes it ) has been drastically shortened @xcite .",
    "online news industry is competitive .",
    "first , there are many more online news sites and second , unlike traditional newspapers , online news sites do not have any physical restriction on the amount of information they can put in , thus they are able to publish more . given that people are only willing to spend a limited time for consuming news",
    ", it is critical for news sites to have effective strategies to catch people s attention and attract their clicks .",
    "however , one aspect that is not yet fully understood are the strategies adopted by companies in this industry to make the news , and consequently the online newspapers , more attractive to users .    one key aspect related to news dissemination and",
    "its attractiveness is the headline that describes it .",
    "a headline s purpose is to quickly and briefly draw attention to the story .",
    "the large type front page headline did not come into use until the late @xmath0 century when increased competition between newspapers led to the use of attention - getting headlines @xcite .",
    "potentially , headlines determine how many people read the news . with the increasing competition of the online world ,",
    "it is not surprising to see headlines become more aggressive , exaggerated , and somewhat misleading .",
    "more important , headlines are not only the first impression of news articles .",
    "recent efforts suggest that they can even drive the way users perceive the rest of the content associated to them by affecting the way people will remember it  @xcite .    despite the absolute importance of headlines on news production and consumption , little",
    "is known about them",
    ". a better understanding of the sentiments expressed in headlines , the popularity of news articles as a function of headlines aspects and the kind of comments news items trigger is key for the design of new systems and , ultimately to society .",
    "all this calls for a better knowledge of today s news articles , which we attempt to provide in this paper .",
    "our effort relies on using sentiment analysis as a mean to capture the strength of sentiments expressed in news headlines ( i.e. if they are exaggerated negatively or positively , or if they are neutral ) .",
    "more specifically , we work towards answering the following specific questions :    * what is the sentiment of the news produced by popular newspapers ?",
    "do they produce more negative , positive or neutral news ?",
    "* extremely negative or positive news are able to attract more clicks ?",
    "in other words , is it worth creating exaggerated headlines ? * how are users reactions to news articles with different sentiments associated to them .",
    "does the sentiment polarity of users comments reflect the polarity of the news headline ?    to perform our analysis we collected and analyzed 69,907 news produced by four major global media corporations  the new york times , bbc , reuters , and dailymail  during a minimum of eight consecutive months in 2014 .",
    "then , we designed an experimental methodology to classify each piece of news in terms of its sentiment , its popularity and its topic .",
    "our analysis resulted in a number of interesting findings .",
    "we show that the majority of the news produced have negative headlines , and the amount of negative news produced is generally constant over time .",
    "the topic category `` world '' concentrates most of the produced news and is one of the most negative categories .",
    "we also show that extremely negative and positive headlines tend to attract more popularity , while neutral headlines tend to be less attractive .",
    "finally , our analysis about users comments show that comments tend to be negative , independently if the news are positive , negative or neutral .",
    "as we will discuss later , these observations have numerous implications to the design of systems that can better support users in choosing and having access to the information they are more interested in .",
    "ultimately , our results contribute to understanding communication in the contemporary media environment , as well as the society we live in .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "next , we present a literature review on online news .",
    "we then describe the dataset that we collected for the study .",
    "we first study the polarity of news headlines and how it differs across topics and changes over time .",
    "we then look at how the sentiment of headline relates to the popularity of the news article .",
    "lastly , we characterize the news comments by their sentiments and how it associate with headlines and news articles .",
    "we conclude with a discussion about the implication of our findings .",
    "online news has been extensively studied in different domains including media and communication , psychology , and computer science .",
    "we briefly describe those efforts regarding news production and consumption with different perspectives",
    ".    * news headlines . *",
    "recently , researchers have conducted an experiment in which factual or opinion news were presented to participants , but with different headlines .",
    "the authors conclude that misleading headlines affect readers memory , inferential reasoning , and behavioral intentions  @xcite .",
    "they argue that these effects arise not only because headlines constrain further information processing , biasing readers towards a specific interpretation , but also because readers struggle to update their memory in order to correct initial misconceptions .",
    "these efforts highlight the importance of news headlines .",
    "it goes beyond attracting users to read news and it even changes individuals perceptions or attitudes towards the content , motivating a study dedicated solely on characterizing headlines .",
    "* reading habits . *",
    "the `` mood management theory '' @xcite states that individuals access to media is highly capable of changing their mood states .",
    "an experimental study related to reading habits @xcite shows that when people have to choose the news they want to read , they are directly influenced by the environment in which they had been earlier . in this experiment",
    ", authors placed men and women in bad and good environments and then provided them with magazine articles .",
    "results showed that those who were exposed to a bad environment were drawn to good news .",
    "it also showed that people in a good mood read more bad news than people in a bad mood .",
    "there are recent efforts that attempt to characterize bias on reading habits of online news users and news coverage of specific events .",
    "@xcite examine aspects related to freedom of reading choices offered by social media sites .",
    "however , as cultural habits are deeply ingrained , reading behaviors might be hard to change . using real instances of political news shared in twitter they study the predictive power of features related to selective exposure , news source credibility and informativeness , and user socialization .",
    "then , authors built a prototype of a news sharing application that promotes serendipitous political readings along these dimensions .",
    "@xcite study reading habits of users of an online news portal to provide insights for better design of news recommendation systems .",
    "as headlines may directly impact reading habits , we hope our study adds a complementary perspective to the above studies .    * news coverage and popularity .",
    "* a few studies have used a large scale dataset of online news to understand how features extracted from news articles and their comments are related to news coverage and popularity .",
    "@xcite characterize the structure of global news coverage of disasters and its determinants by using a large - scale news dataset .",
    "they find strong regionalism in news geography and identify the type of news that is more likely to be covered globally .",
    "then , a recent effort proposes a popularity prediction approach to ranking online news  @xcite . based on features extracted mainly from users comments , they formulate a classification problem where the goal is not to infer the precise attention that an article will receive , but to accurately rank articles by their predicted popularity .",
    "we hope our analysis related to news categories , popularity , and sentiments may complement existing studies on news coverage and bring into perspective novel features that are discriminative and that potentially could be incorporated into classifiers",
    ".    * news propagation .",
    "* propagation aspects were analyzed in @xcite and @xcite , using twitter as a proxy . in the first study ,",
    "a forecasting model was developed for computing the probability that a given tweet would be forwarded solely based on its content .",
    "as made explicit in the very title of the work , they identified evidences that negative news spread faster .",
    "in addition , the results provide further interesting insights into propagation dynamics .",
    "the second study focuses on temporal dynamics of information , in order to predict urls that fade rapidly following their peak of popularity and those that fade more slowly . using liwc to measure sentiments ,",
    "they show that the most negative information quickly disappears and the most positive tends to persist .",
    "finally , @xcite take a qualitative and quantitative approach , also using twitter , and present evidence that negative sentiment enhances virality in the news segment , but not in the non - news segment .",
    "* sentiment analysis of news .",
    "* recent efforts have explored sentiment analysis to examine news articles or to create novel applications related to this context .",
    "for example , @xcite analyze a set of blogs and news articles to propose a method that trades stocks based on sentiment of company - related news .",
    "another application , namely magnet news @xcite , is a tool that separates positive from negative news in popular newspapers and allows readers to choose which pieces of news to read according to their polarity .",
    "more related to our effort , @xcite explore relationship among news comments topicality , temporality , sentiment , and quality in a dataset of 54,540 news comments .",
    "their observations indicate that comment sentiments , both positive and negative , can be useful indicators of discourse quality . as we will show later , using a different dataset for comments , our findings present a different perspective .",
    "in order to characterize online news headlines , first we collected news from four major news sources .",
    "then we inferred their sentiment , popularity , and topical category .",
    "next we briefly describe the methodology adopted for the analysis .",
    "we crawled data from four different news sources : bbc news online , dailymail online , the new york times and reuters online .",
    "all of them are world wide known online news media with millions of readers daily . for bbc , dailymail , and the new york times we monitored their rss feed daily from march to november 2014 .",
    "articles on the main page of the website were crawled and blogs and news that are featured in specific sections were excluded .    to crawl reuters we needed to retroactively collect the newspaper archive , from january 2013 to september 2014 .",
    "we focused only on the `` top news '' publications .",
    "for this specific source we were also able to crawl the user comments for each piece of news .",
    "table  [ table : datasets ] summarizes the main statistics about these four datasets .",
    "popularity & mean popularity & mar/2014-nov/2014 & 11,707 & - & 671.19 & 67 & mar/2014-nov/2014 & 26,867 & - & 456.89 & 75 & mar/2014-nov/2014 & 4,256 & - & 630.03 & 189 & jan/2013-sep/2014 & 27,051 & 166,329 & 149.48 & 7      recent efforts show that there is no one method that is most suitable for all kinds of data  @xcite .",
    "thus , instead of using one popular sentiment analysis method , we briefly investigated which method would be the most appropriate for our datasets .",
    "to do so we randomly selected 100 news headlines and 100 comments from our data and asked three volunteers from our research lab to manually label these comments as positive , negative or neutral .",
    "each volunteer labeled the data independently , without the influence of the others .",
    "the percentage of agreement between the volunteers was 92% for headlines and 90% for comments .",
    "we used this small labeled dataset as a ground truth and we compared the performance of eight sentiment analysis methods used by the ifeel system  @xcite .",
    "sentistrength  @xcite performed better for both , headlines and comments , with an accuracy of 74% and 79% , respectively .",
    "other methods showed competitive results with sentistrengh , but an interesting property of this machine learning based method is that it measures the strength of the polarity sentiments in texts in a scale from -5 ( very negative ) to + 5 ( very positive ) .",
    "this provides an interesting perspective of the intensity of the sentiment expressed in the news headlines .",
    "table  [ tab : example - title ] provides examples of headlines classified according to sentistrength scores .",
    "there was no data classified with scores 1 or -1 in our dataset .    [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     another implication from our analysis",
    "is related to the predominance of negative news headlines in all the news sources we analyzed .",
    "it is known that the news people read have impacts on their behavior @xcite and ultimately can affect society . however , as we noted from the analysis of the news categories , the category `` world '' contains most of the content generated by the news sources analyzed and is one of the most negative categories .",
    "this result seems to support the conjectures that news media usually report foreign disasters and keep a negative tone when describing happenings in other countries as an attempt to emphasize the safety of the home country @xcite .",
    "other studies propose to investigate and quantify a possible ideological bias by news organizations @xcite .",
    "there are multiple strategies that could be designed to attract clicks to news items that rely mostly on dissemination mechanisms @xcite and recommendation of personalized content @xcite . by characterizing the sentiment expressed in headlines we show that neutral news are usually less popular than extremely positive and negative news .",
    "this observation can be leveraged to construct a number of support systems related to online news .    as an example ,",
    "a recent work proposes a ranking scheme based on the news popularity prediction @xcite .",
    "our findings related to news popularity show that sentiment scores inferred from headlines are valuable features for popularity prediction . intuitively , we believe there might be other patterns and features to be extracted from headlines that can help on predictive tasks .",
    "for example , we noted a number of headlines that enumerates a sequence of things such as _ top n ... _ or _",
    "eleven things you should know about _ , etc , and that they usually seem to be more popular than the average .",
    "figure  [ fig : word_tree ] shows a word tree visualization  @xcite for the root term _ top 10 _ using as input the headlines of our dataset .",
    "the visualization shows phrases that branch off from the root term across all headlines in our dataset .",
    "a larger font size means that the word occurs more often .",
    "one direction we plan to take as future work is to identify patterns on headlines that can help in predicting their future popularity .",
    "how many times have you read or heard the following sentence : `` do nt read the comments . '' ?",
    "recently , the anthropologist krystal dcosta put an exclamation mark to this phrase on an article she wrote for scientific american : `` do nt read the comments ! ( why do we read the online comments when we know they ll be bad ? ) ''  @xcite .",
    "she explains that when people from different backgrounds and cultures interact , they may read something that challenges their world view and then logic and reason disappear : all that matters is that they let you know how wrong you are or the topic / perspective / subject is .",
    "all of a sudden , the comments section has become a rant .",
    "tauriq moosa went further by writing in an article for the guardian that the comments section `` groans as hatred expands its force , waiting for any point of dissent to break it   to unleash its full fury on targets who dare convey some measure of civility or dissent ''  @xcite .",
    "our findings show that negative comments are ubiquitous .",
    "online news are likely to attract negative comments independently of the sentiment of the headline or the category of the news .",
    "this seems to be related to the situation identified by @xcite , in which negative comments tend to  snowball \" .",
    "they claim that negative comments can be seen as a negative feedback and `` authors of negatively - evaluated content contribute more , but also their future posts are of lower quality , and are perceived by the community as such .",
    "then , these authors are more likely to subsequently evaluate their fellow users negatively , percolating these effects through the community . in contrast , positive feedback does not carry similar effects , and neither encourages rewarded authors to write more , nor improves the quality of their posts . ''",
    "this could be one of the reasons why trends of negative comments are always dominating trends of positive ones .",
    "it is worth mentioning that reuters was the only news source from the four sources we considered that had comments available for collection at the time we gathered our dataset ( end of november ) . today",
    ", reuters has shut down its comments feature and does not allow users to comment on articles anymore .",
    "we could speculate that the decision might be related to the predominance of negative comments .",
    "in this paper we presented a thorough characterization of online news articles based on a dataset of 69,907 news produced by four major global media corporations , gathered during a minimum of eight consecutive months in 2014 .",
    "we presented the methodology we designed to conduct our analysis putting headlines as a central artifact as they are key to attract attention in online news .",
    "our methodology used sentiment analysis as a mean to understand intrinsic aspects of headlines and also a strategy to infer news popularity based on a url shortening service .",
    "our results unveil a number of interesting findings regarding sentiment of news headlines and their use in online news .",
    "these results bring relevant contributions to other researchers investigating characterization or prediction patterns of online news , to the design of online news systems and ultimately to society . as a final contribution",
    "we have also made the dataset we built available in the hope that it can facilitate different research efforts in this field .",
    "this work was funded by grants from cnpq , capes and fapemig ."
