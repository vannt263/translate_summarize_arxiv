    "uncertainty is the threshold density for the state @xmath2 is quite large , @xmath2 states are anomalously suppressed beyond @xmath79 . since in the threshold model threshold density",
    "is assumed to be proportional to the energy density above which the charmonium states get dissociated in qgp , if @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the dissociation temperatures then @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , threshold temperatures of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are calculated in the lattice based models , @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xcite . within the large uncertainty ,",
    "the ratio of the threshold temperatures extracted from the rhic data on @xmath0 suppression agree with the lattice calculation .    while the threshold densities @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath46 are found to be nearly independent of @xmath27 , the fraction @xmath6 is not .",

    "we also observe that an empirical relation ,    @xmath87    exist between best fitted @xmath6 and @xmath27 .",

    "to summarise , in the qgp motivated threshold model , we have analyzed the mid - rapidity phenix data on the centrality dependence of @xmath0 suppression in au+au collisions . in the threshold model , in addition to the normal nuclear absorption , @xmath0 s are anomalously suppressed , such that , if the local transverse density exceeds a threshold value @xmath1 , all the @xmath0 s are absorbed .",
    "we have extended the threshold model to include the feedback from higher states @xmath2 and @xmath16 .",
    "the extended model has four parameters , the threshold density ( @xmath1 ) for anomalous suppression of direct @xmath0 , the threshold density ( @xmath46 ) for anomalous suppression of the state @xmath2 , the fraction @xmath6 of the states @xmath2 and the @xmath0-nucleon absorption cross section ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we observed that the centrality dependence of @xmath0 suppression can not determine the fraction @xmath6 of the state @xmath2 and the nuclear absorption cross - section @xmath27 independently . in the threshold model",
    "they are inter - dependent .",
    "anomalous suppression of the state @xmath2 , to certain extent , can mimic the nuclear absorption of @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the phenix data can be fitted either with large @xmath6 and small @xmath27 or the vice - versa . for @xmath27=0 - 2 mb , we have fitted the phenix data by varying @xmath1 , @xmath46 and @xmath6 .",
    "data are well described for @xmath3 @xmath117 , @xmath5 @xmath117 .",
    "the uncertainty in the parametric values could be reduced if the quality of the data is improved .",
    "the fraction @xmath6 depend on the value of @xmath27 , @xmath86 , the upper and lower values corresponds to @xmath27=0 and 2 mb respectively .",
    "threshold model with parameters fixed from the au+au collisions is then used predict for the centrality dependence of @xmath0 suppression in pb+pb collisions at lhc energy . at lhc energy",
    "the model predicts that in central collisions @xmath0 s are suppressed by a factor of 3 - 4 .",
    "suppression pattern is similar to that in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "in central collisions , possibly @xmath0 s are slightly less suppressed in pb+pb collisions at lhc energy than in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "we have also estimated the qgp formation time . on the basis of the empirical observation that in all the centrality ranges of au+au collisions , the square of the maximum transverse density times a factor 0.29 , correctly reproduces the phenix measurements on bjorken energy density times the formation time , we have argued that the threshold density gives the upper bound for the qgp formation time . for critical temperature",
    "@xmath118 mev , qgp formation time is estimated as @xmath119 fm .    to conclude , threshold model analysis of @xmath0 suppression in au+au collisions at rhic , strongly suggest that in central and mid - central collisions ( @xmath77 ) qgp is produced at sufficiently high temperature @xmath78 , to melt the directly produced @xmath0 s .",
    "the analysis also indicates that qgp is produced rather early in the collisions .",
