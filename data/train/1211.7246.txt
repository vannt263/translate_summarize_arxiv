    "the quantum mechanical two coulomb centers problem @xmath0 plays a fundamental role in various questions of atomic physics , quantum chemistry of diatomic molecules and collision theory . the problem is to determine wave functions and terms of an electron moving in the field of two fixed charges @xmath1 and @xmath2 located at the distance @xmath3 from each other .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , in atomic units @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 due to high symmetry of ( [ e1 ] ) , the corresponding schrdinger equation allows for the separation of variables in prolate spheroidal coordinates . as early as in 1930s , jaffe @xcite , baber and hasse @xcite offered expressions for one - dimensional eigenfunctions in the form of series whose coefficients satisfy three - term recurrence relations @xcite .",
    "thereafter , based on these expansions , algorithms were developed to calculate the terms with relative accuracy of @xmath6 and the wave functions @xmath7 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all of this led to considering various generalizations of the problem @xmath0 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "application of the two coulomb centers problem in the atomic and molecular scattering theory is based on the fact that the motion of the electrons and nuclei can be considered adiabatically due to large difference in their masses . in other words ,",
    "the potential curves @xmath8 or quasimolecular terms are introduced for the colliding particles .",
    "these curves are analytic functions of the internuclear distance @xmath9 transitions between two terms @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related to their common complex branch point @xmath12 in the vicinity of which the energy surface looks like a corkscrew : @xmath13 in case of slow collisions @xmath14 the branch points located near the real axis play a dominant role .",
    "then , in the framework of the adiabatic approximation , it is possible to obtain a simple expression for the transition probability in such inelastic processes as ionization @xcite .",
    "more recently , in the 1980s , in connection with needs of physics of thermonuclear fusion , a range of velocities @xmath15 attracted interest , that is , there appeared a need to study positions of the terms singular points in the two coulomb centers problem , throughout the complex plane of the intercenter ( internuclear ) distance @xmath9 for the first time , such calculations were started by e.  a.  solovev @xcite and then continued with his coauthors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main result of these studies is that the various types of `` hidden '' quasicrossings of the terms were found , and approximate expressions relating quasicrossing parameters to quasi - molecule characteristics and quantum numbers were obtained .",
    "note that in the works @xcite and @xcite@xcite , the consideration was conducted in prolate spheroidal coordinates .",
    "in other words , a solution of the problem @xmath0 for real @xmath3 was taken as a basis for the generalizations , and the terms for complex @xmath3 were obtained by their analytic continuation from the real axis .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the generalization of a different kind .",
    "some time ago , yu .  n.  demkov expressed the following idea [ private communication ] . in going to an imaginary parameter @xmath3 and complex - conjugate charges in the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] )",
    ", it remains hermitian .",
    "the schrdinger equation in this case will also allow a separation of variables in oblate spheroidal coordinates but not in prolate . because the potential is two - sheeted , there are additional possibilities in choice of boundary conditions and formulation of boundary - value problems .",
    "thus , a new exactly solvable quantum problem ( integrable system ) , whose solution can not be reduced to the special case @xcite@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the properties of the potential relating to our problem .",
    "the third part deals with the separation of variables and the formulation of boundary - value problems .",
    "particular attention should be paid to appearance of a new type of the boundary - value problems for the quasi - radial equation .",
    "such type of the problems has never been considered previously , which is connected to a configuration of the equation singular points and configuration of the region in which the eigenfunctions are found .",
    "description of these problems solution is the subject of a separate mathematical work , so in this article we restrict ourselves to presenting the results of numerical calculations . in the fourth part , the asymptotics of the eigenfunctions and terms are presented . in section 5 ,",
    "the results of the numerical calculations are given .",
    "in conclusions we discuss possible physical applications .",
    "note also that the classical analogue of our problem is known as _ the generalized two fixed centers problem _ and refers to celestial mechanics @xcite .",
    "for the first time , the problem arose in 1961 , when it was necessary to take into consideration the effect of non - sphericity of the earth s gravitational field on satellites trajectories .",
    "the substitution of @xmath16 for the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) , where @xmath17 are real numbers , reduces it to a hermitian operator again , inasmuch as the last two terms are complex - conjugate .",
    "this operator can be considered as a new hamiltonian whose coordinate part we will call _ the potential of the generalized two coulomb centers problem . _ for more clearness , we use the cartesian coordinate system",
    ". then @xmath18 it is evident that the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 appear in the expression ( [ a1 ] ) linearly , so we represent it as a sum @xmath21 each member of the sum ( [ a2 ] ) has the following types of symmetry :    1 .   symmetry with respect to rotations around the @xmath22axis by an arbitrary angle , 2 .",
    "symmetry ( antisymmetry ) with respect to reflection in the @xmath23 plane : @xmath24 3 .   symmetry ( antisymmetry ) with respect to inversion : @xmath25 4 .",
    "scale symmetry : @xmath26    the property 3 ) is a consequence of 1 ) and 2 ) .",
    "the last property indicates that there are only two non - trivial parameters in the generalized quantum mechanical two coulomb centers problem : @xmath3 and ratio of @xmath27 or @xmath28    now , let us turn our attention to the fact that the expression ( [ a1 ] ) defines two - sheeted mapping , which is singular on the circle @xmath29 and not at the points @xmath30 as it was in the problem @xmath31 thus , the space in which the wave functions will be determined becomes two - sheeted , and the potential @xmath32 does not already allow a simple electrostatic interpretation .",
    "way out of this difficulty is the following .",
    "_ first , _ the regular branches ( sheets ) can be glued along the singular circle @xmath33 to a certain analog of the riemann surface and the potential @xmath32 can be considered as the electrostatic potential on the extended space .",
    "_ second , _ if we use the fact that any multiply connected space can be made simply connected by inserting proper barriers , and keep one or another branch in ( [ a1 ] ) fixed , we can interpret the potential @xmath34 in such space with the barrier , as a certain electrostatic potential .",
    "it should be emphasized that the topological considerations allow considerable arbitrariness in choosing form of the barrier , it is only important that its boundary coincides with the singular circle @xmath35 however , the requirement of the variables separation ( as shown below ) leaves only three basic variants .",
    "they are the circle @xmath36 its exterior @xmath37 and their union @xmath38 that is , the entire @xmath39plane .    if the branches ( [ a1 ] ) are placed symmetrically relative to the top and bottom sides of the barrier : @xmath40 we get an analog of the simple - layer potential ; when the branches are placed antisymmetrically : @xmath41 we get an analog of the double - layer potential .",
    "now , let us agree on the terminology : in future , the spectral problem in the extended space will be referred to as _ two - sheeted problem , _ and in the ordinary space with a barrier - _ one - sheeted problem . _",
    "it is known @xcite that the potentials in which the schrdinger equation is separable in oblate spheroidal coordinates @xmath42 must be presented in the form of : @xmath43 the connection of these coordinates with cartesian coordinates is given by the following relations : @xmath44 where the variables domains @xmath45 is traditionally chosen by one of the two alternative methods : @xmath46,\\;\\;\\ ; \\varphi \\in [ 0,2\\pi);\\ ] ] @xmath47,\\;\\;\\ ; \\varphi \\in [ 0,2\\pi).\\ ] ] note that the cases ( [ a4 ] ) and ( [ a5 ] ) are related ro the one - sheeted problem , since the relation ( [ a3 ] ) determines a biunivocal mapping ( bijection ) @xmath48    if we proceed to consider the two - sheeted problem , the variables domain @xmath49 should be chosen as follows : @xmath50\\,,\\;\\;\\ ; \\varphi \\in [ 0,2\\pi)\\,.\\ ] ] then the mapping @xmath51 will be single - valued , and the inverse @xmath52 ",
    "double - valued .",
    "let us change the variables in ( [ a1 ] ) according to ( [ a3 ] ) and recall that the potential of the generalized two coulomb centers problem can be constructed in different ways .",
    "a simple analysis shows that there exists a total of nine variants of such structures allowing the separation of variables , at that the most physically meaningful are three of them : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55    the variant ( [ a7 ] ) refers to the double - sheeted problem with the variables domain @xmath56 as well as to one - sheeted problem with the domain @xmath45 according to ( [ a4 ] ) or ( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "when the domain @xmath45 is determined by ( [ a4 ] ) , the impermeable barrier must be the circle @xmath57 then @xmath58 is interpreted as analog of the simple - layer potential , and @xmath59  double - layer . if the domain @xmath45 is determined by ( [ a5 ] ) , the barrier must be the exterior of the circle @xmath60 then @xmath58 is interpreted as analog of the double - layer potential , and @xmath59  simple - layer .",
    "the variants ( [ a8 ] ) and ( [ a9 ] ) are derivatives from ( [ a7 ] ) and refer to one - sheeted problems where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are analogs of the simple - layer potential . in the case of ( [ a8 ] ) , the domain @xmath45 is determined by ( [ a4 ] ) , and in the case of ( [ a9 ] ) , it is determined by ( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that if we consider the generalized quantum mechanical two coulomb centers problem in the half - space , the barrier must be @xmath39plane .",
    "the domain @xmath45 is determined as follows : @xmath61,\\;\\;\\ ; \\varphi \\in [ 0,2\\pi)\\,.\\ ] ] in this case , differences between ( [ a7 ] ) , ( [ a8 ] ) and ( [ a9 ] ) vanish .",
    "let us follow the variable separation procedure and the formulation of boundary - value problems by the example of ( [ a7 ] ) , since this variant is basic .",
    "let us represent the wave function @xmath62 corresponding to the term @xmath63 in the form of @xmath64 where the multiindex @xmath65 denotes the quantum number set in which @xmath66 and @xmath67 coincide with the numbers of zeros of the corresponding functions in the variables @xmath68 and @xmath69 and the number @xmath70 takes the values @xmath71 the normalization constant @xmath72 is determined by the condition @xmath73 where @xmath74  is a volume element in the oblate spheroidal coordinates . after substituting ( [ a7 ] ) and ( [ a10 ] ) ) in the schrdinger equation @xmath75 we obtain the ordinary differential system @xmath76x_{mk}(\\xi;r ) = 0 , \\ ] ] @xmath77y_{mq}(\\eta;r ) = 0 .\\ ] ] here @xmath78 at that @xmath79 has the meaning of the energy parameter ; @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the charge parameters ; @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the separation constants",
    ".    the equations ( [ a11 ] ) and ( [ a12 ] ) supplemented by the boundary conditions form the boundary value problems that must be solved simultaneously , and the energy spectrum can be obtained from the condition @xmath84 the general theory of sturm - liouville - type one - dimensional boundary problems implies that the quantum numbers @xmath85 remain constant for the continuous variation of the intercenter parameter @xmath86 and the eigenvalues @xmath87 or @xmath88 are non - degeneracy .",
    "consequently , if the solution of equation ( [ a13 ] ) exists , it is unique .",
    "let us now discuss the formulation of boundary - value problems .",
    "on the one hand , it follows from the most common requirements for the wave function that @xmath89 \\right ) \\cup",
    "{ \\cal l}_{2}^{(\\varphi)}\\left ( [ 0,2\\pi ) \\right)\\,.\\ ] ] on the other hand , in the spatial domain where the potential becomes infinite , the particle can not penetrate at all , that is , there must be @xmath90 the continuity of @xmath91 requires that @xmath91 becomes zero on the boundary of this domain ; generally speaking , in this case the derivative of @xmath91 has a jump @xcite .",
    "thus , in the one - sheeted problem , where the circle @xmath92 is the barrier for the wave function , we have : @xmath93 the normal derivative must jump @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a smooth function of @xmath96 and parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath9 from the conditions ( [ a14 ] ) and ( [ a15 ] ) , we obtain the boundary conditions for quasi - radial function @xmath97 { } 0.\\ ] ] in the quasi - angular equation ( [ a12 ] ) the boundary points are simultaneously singular , so to satisfy the condition ( [ a14 ] ) , it should be required that the function be limited in them : @xmath98 ) also holds , and the condition ( [ a16 ] ) is satisfied automatically .    in the one - sheeted problem with the barrier @xmath99 it is necessary to impose on the wave function the following condition : @xmath100 for the normal derivative we obtain @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a smooth function of @xmath96 and parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath9 from the ( [ a19 ] )",
    ", we obtain the boundary conditions for the quasi - radial and quasi - angular functions : @xmath103 in the two - sheeted problem no barriers appear , but there is a circle @xmath33 on which the potential is singular , therefore , the following condition must be satisfied : @xmath104 which is in contradiction with the expression ( [ a10 ] ) . indeed , if the expressions ( [ a10 ] ) and ( [ a21 ] ) are valid , we have the alternative :    1 .",
    "@xmath105 or @xmath106 2 .",
    "@xmath107 and @xmath108 simultaneously ,    which , generally speaking , does not follow from any physical considerations .",
    "the contradiction arises particularly acute when we consider the ground state .",
    "it is apparent that both cases are not satisfied .",
    "the way out of the situation is to separate factors ( factorization ) @xmath109 here , the overline means that we are dealing with one - dimensional functions of the two - sheeted problem . although the functions satisfy ( [ a11 ] ) and ( [ a12 ] ) , but they essentially different from the corresponding functions of the one - sheeted problem .",
    "the boundary conditions in the two - sheeted problem are formulated as follows : @xmath110 because now the boundary points are singular .",
    "let us now discuss the specific of the boundary - value problems related to the quasi - radial equation .",
    "in the problem @xmath0 the corresponding equation was considered on the interval @xmath111 that is , between the singular points . then , using the jaffe transformation @xcite for the independent variable @xmath112 the interval is transferred to the unit segment , and the additional singular point -1 goes to @xmath113 and does not effect the convergence of series representing the eigenfunction . in our problem , the equation ( [ a11 ] ) on the complex @xmath114plane has three singular points : two finite regular point @xmath115 and one irregular at infinity .",
    "it is clear that the points @xmath116 and @xmath117 are `` on different sides '' of the real axis , and so any attempt to present @xmath118 in the form of series faces the problem of the circle of convergence .",
    "use of standard techniques , such as the transformation of jaffe @xcite or jaffe - lay @xcite , are no longer possible here , and therefore it is necessary to look for a more general method including the standard methods as special cases . note that the problem of the circle of convergence will always appear in the boundary - value problems after separation of variables in the schrdinger equation in oblate spheroidal coordinates ( it is typical for these coordinates ) .",
    "in conclusion of this paragraph we note that the separation of the factors in ( [ a22 ] ) , without changing the structure of the equations ( [ a11 ] ) and ( [ a12 ] ) , can affect the convergence of the series for the one - dimensional functions .",
    "in the context of possible practical applications of the model under consideration , the pattern of the terms is of the most interest . in order to correctly identify the individual terms",
    "it is necessary to know the initial approximation or asymptotic of @xmath120 as @xmath119 in this limit , the difference between the one - sheeted and two - sheeted problems disappears and , in addition , the spherical symmetry arises , therefore it is natural to go to spherical coordinates @xmath121    let us expand the potential ( [ a1 ] ) in powers of the small parameter @xmath122 using the formula ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath123 where odd multipole moments associated with the parameter @xmath124 and the even multipoles with @xmath125 it is clear that only one term @xmath126 in ( [ c1 ] ) does not vanish as @xmath119 this term is naturally chosen as the unperturbed potential while the perturbation will be the first term of the second sum @xmath127 then the terms @xmath120 must continuously transit to @xmath128fold degenerate energy levels of the hydrogen atom with a charge @xmath129 @xmath130 { } e_{nlm } = - { { \\displaystyle \\frac{2q_{1}^{2}}{n^{2}}}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath131is a set of spherical quantum numbers which are related to the numbers of zeros of the one - dimensional eigenfunctions by the relations : @xmath132 the radial @xmath118 and angular @xmath133 parts of the eigenfunction @xmath91 are reduced to into the radial @xmath134 and angular @xmath135 parts of one - center problem .",
    "@xmath136 that will be the correct function of the zero approximation .",
    "arguments similar to those in @xcite , give the following expression for the energy in the first non - vanishing order : @xmath137r^2}{n^{3}l(l+1)(2l-1)(2l+1)(2l+3 ) } } } + o((r)^2)\\,.\\ ] ] note that formula ( [ c4 ] ) reduces to baber and hasse s result @xcite by means of the substitution @xmath138 the calculation of the energy in the following order of the perturbation theory becomes quite cumbersome and , in addition , there one can expect logarithmic corrections similar to those obtained in @xcite for the problem @xmath31",
    "the boundary - value problems , which are equations ( [ a11 ] ) and ( [ a12 ] ) supplemented by the boundary conditions ( [ a17 ] ) , ( [ a18 ] ) and ( [ a20 ] ) , have been solved numerically . as noted above , the condition ( [ a13 ] ) for the fixed parameters @xmath139 and @xmath65 has a unique solution @xmath140 solving it for @xmath141 we find discrete spectrum . for the classification of the terms , in addition to @xmath142 we will also use the set of spherical quantum numbers @xmath143 let us keep the traditional spectroscopic notation , when the numbers @xmath144 correspond to the letter rows @xmath145 therefore , in order to make any conclusions about the structure of the energy spectrum in the generalized quantum mechanical two coulomb centers problem , at least on a qualitative level , it is necessary to find a meaningful collection of the special cases of @xmath120 which covers the transition and asymptotic ( as @xmath146 ) domains .",
    "calculations with different combinations of @xmath147 and @xmath148 show that such collection is formed from the first ten @xmath120 at @xmath149.$ ] it can be explained by the fact that there is a scaling ( see property 4 ) of the potential ( [ a1 ] ) ) in our problem .",
    "thus , in spite of the fact that the total of about two thousand curves have been calculated , the structure of the spectrum was determined in a very wide domain of variation of @xmath150 and @xmath9    analysis of the curves shows that the pattern of the terms varies considerably for @xmath151 and @xmath152 this statement becomes especially obvious when selecting two systems differing from each other by the permutation @xmath153 for example , @xmath154 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) and @xmath155 ( see fig . [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "first of all , pay attention to the fact that the terms in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] have distinct local minima at finite @xmath86 whereas the terms in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] change rather aslope .",
    "the availability of the minima of @xmath120 at @xmath151 indicates the stable states of a moving charged particle in such systems .",
    "the case of @xmath156 requires a separate consideration .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that in the spherically symmetric field @xmath157 with @xmath158 the energy levels exponentially condense to the continuous spectrum border .",
    "one can see a similar effect in the fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "we stress that the continuous spectrum starts at finite values of @xmath9    note that in all three figures the dashed lines depict the border of continuous spectrum .",
    "the question of the configuration interaction of the terms or their quasicrossings requires special consideration . in the works of e.",
    "a.  solovev @xcite@xcite , the branch points were found near the imaginary axis @xmath86 so we can expect quasicrossings in the spectrum of our problem .",
    "we have considered a new exactly solvable quantum problem . in distinction to the @xmath0 problem , our problem allows for various choices of boundary conditions .",
    "it gives us additional opportunities in setting the boundary problems .",
    "we have shown that the boundary problems associated with the quasi - radial equation belong to a new type .",
    "the peculiarity of these problems is related to the fact that the singular points of the differential equation are on different sides of the region in which the eigenfunctions are defined .",
    "analytic representations of such eigenfunctions are not known yet . even in the famous paper @xcite where an analogous problem for spheroidal equations has arised ,",
    "the boundary problems were not duly considered and the relevant discussions were largely avoided . therefore ,",
    "our paper can be considered as an incentive for the mathematical physics experts to analyse the problems of this type . in particular",
    ", it owuld be interesting to apply the nikiforov - uvarov method @xcite and asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to these problems .",
    "note that in recent paper @xcite an exactly solvable problem was considered with a ring - shaped noncentral potential .",
    "singularities of this potential were located on a plane , instead of a circle as in our work , and the separation of variables in the schr \" odinger equation was performed in spherical coordinates . therefore , the nikiforov - uvarov method could be used for determination of the eigenfunctions .",
    "our boundary problems are far more complex .",
    "nikiforov - uvarov method has never been applied to such models .",
    "we have shown for the first time that quantum problems can be considered on riemannian surfaces .",
    "probably , this idea could give some insights into the puzzle of confinement of quarks .",
    "at least , one could consider models of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite type on riemannian surfaces .",
    "numerical calculations have shown that for @xmath151 the terms @xmath120 do have minima at finite values of @xmath9 it implies that such systems possess stable states .",
    "we believe that the demkov problem may be viewed as a model for higher excited electron states in the fields of various ring molecules ( e.g. , aromatic hydrocarbons ) .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic formulas ( [ c3 ] ) and ( [ c4 ] ) may be of use for description of higher excited states of benzene @xcite which have been observed experimentally . exact quantum mechanical computation of these states is very challenging from the technical side .",
    "our work offers a possibility of simple description not only for benzene but for a good number of ring molecules ."
