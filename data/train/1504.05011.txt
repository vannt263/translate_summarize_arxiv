    "so , the classification of all possible groups of birational automorphisms of qcy3 is equivalent to the following _ projective _ linear algebra problem in the classical invariant theory :    find all finite subgroups @xmath8 such that there is a homogeneous polynomial @xmath4 of degree @xmath5 , which is _ smooth _ , such that for each @xmath9 there is @xmath10 such that @xmath11 = g$ ] , i.e. , @xmath12 a representative of @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "this is in principle possible but practically hard in general , which we first explain . as usual in the finite group theory",

    "we control the cases where @xmath31 and then larger orders cases are reduced to these cases in pc free way .    on the other hand , the case where @xmath15 has a larger prime order element , theorem of brauer ( see theorem [ thm : brauer ] ) is quite effective to determine possible @xmath15 in our case .",
