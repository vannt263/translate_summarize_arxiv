    "it is known that in the last years of the past century a major surprise occurred in our knowledge of the universe : the dominance of dark energy ( de ) in the total energy budget of the universe , together with a close value of de and dark matter ( dm ) energy densities in the present epoch of the universe evolution . indeed ,",
    "their ratio is roughly two today , while one may expect it to have taken values different from o(1 ) even by orders of magnitude during the whole evolution of the universe from the big bang until the present time .",
    "this `` coincidence problem '' may hint at a possible correlation between de and dm .",
    "for instance , if one is to envisage de as resulting from an ultralight scalar field rolling down its potential ( the so - called quintessence explanation of de ) , then one could naively think that such a correlation results from a direct interaction between the dm particles and the scalar quintessence field . however , the extreme lightness of the scalar quintessence field , whose mass should correspond roughly to the inverse of the hubble parameter , i.e. o@xmath0 , and its time variation are at the basis of a host of severe phenomenological problems to be tackled ( new long range forces with violations of the weak equivalence principle , time variation of the fundamental couplings , etc . ) . in this talk",
    "we wish to emphasize that the severe limitations we have to impose on such direct interactions between dm and de do not prevent de to have an indirect impact on dm .",
    "namely , we wish to examine a couple of situations where the presence of quintessential de in the early universe largely influences today abundances of dm with significant changes on our prospects for direct and indirect dm searches .    according to the standard paradigm",
    ", a particle species goes through two main regimes during the cosmological evolution . at early times",
    "it stays in thermal equilibrium , until the particle interaction rate @xmath1 remains larger than the expansion rate h. later on , the particles will be so diluted by the expansion of the universe that they will not interact anymore and h will overcome @xmath1 .",
    "the epoch at which @xmath2 h is called ` freeze - out ' , and after that time the number of particles per comoving volume for any given species will remain constant .",
    "this is how cold dark matter particle relics ( neutralinos , for example ) are generated .",
    "as it can be easily understood , this scenario strongly depends on the evolution equation for h in the early universe , which is usually assumed to be radiation  dominated . however , as it was already noticed some time ago @xcite , there is little or no evidence that before big bang nuclesynthesis ( bbn ) it was necessarily so .",
    "non - standard scenarios are then worth exploring . in particular , if we imagine that for some time in the past the hubble parameter was larger than usually thought ( for example , due to the presence of some other component , in addition to radiation ) , then the decoupling of particle species would be anticipated , resulting in a net enhancement of their relic abundance .    a natural candidate for doing that is the quintessence scalar , which is thought to consitute the dark energy fluid dominating the present universe .",
    "in most quintessence models , the cosmological scalar is assumed to become the dominant component of the universe after a long period of sub - domination @xcite , playing little or no role in the earliest epochs",
    ". however , this has not always to be the case , as we will show in the following .",
    "we will focus on the possibility of modifying the past evolution of the hubble paramenter h , with the double aim of respecting all the post - bbn bounds for the expansion rate and of producing a mesurable enhancement of the dark matter particles relic abundance .",
    "in particular , we will report about two possible mechanism by which the past dynamics of the quintessence scalar could significantly modify the standard evolution of the pre - bbn universe : an early `` kination '' phase and a `` scalar - tensor '' model .",
    "if we imagine to add a significant fraction of scalar energy density to the background radiation at some time in the cosmological history , this would produce a variation in @xmath3 , depending on the scalar equation of state @xmath4 . if @xmath5 , the scalar energy density would decay more rapidly than radiation , but temporarily increase the global expansion rate .",
    "this possibility was explicitly considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was calculated that a huge enhancement of the relic abundance of neutralinos could be produced in this way .    in a flat universe , a scalar field with potential",
    "@xmath6 obeys the equations @xmath7 for any given time during the cosmological evolution , the relative importance of the scalar energy density w.r.t .  to matter and radiation in the total energy density",
    "@xmath8 depends on the initial conditions , and is constrained by the available cosmological data on the expansion rate and large scale structure .",
    "if the potential @xmath6 is of the runaway type , the initial stage of the scalar evolution is typically characterized by a period of so  called ` kination ' @xcite during which the scalar energy density @xmath9 is dominated by the kinetic contribution @xmath10 , giving @xmath11 .",
    "after this initial phase , the field comes to a stop and remains nearly constant for some time ( ` freezing ' phase ) , until it eventually reaches an attractor solution @xcite .",
    "then , if we modify the standard picture according to which only radiation plays a role in the post - inflationary era and suppose that at some time @xmath12 the scalar contribution was small but non negligible w.r.t .",
    "radiation , then at that time the expansion rate @xmath13 should be correspondingly modified . during the kination phase the scalar to radiation energy density ratio evolves like @xmath14 , and so the scalar contribution would rapidly fall off and leave room to radiation . in this way , we can respect the bbn bounds and at the same time keep a significant scalar contribution to the total energy density just few red - shifts before .",
    "the increase in the expansion rate @xmath15 due to the additional scalar contribution would anticipate the decoupling of particle species and result in a net increase of the corresponding relic densities .",
    "as shown in @xcite , a scalar to radiation energy density ratio @xmath16 at bbn would give an enhancement of the neutralino codensity of roughly three orders of magnitude .",
    "the enhancement of the relic density of neutralinos requires that at some early time the scalar energy density was dominating the universe .",
    "this fact raises a problem if we want to identify the scalar contribution responsible for this phenomenon with the quintessence field @xcite .",
    "indeed , the initial conditions must be such that the scalar energy density is sub - dominant at the beginning , if we want the quintessence field to reach the cosmological attractor in time to be responsible for the presently observed acceleration of the expansion @xcite . for initial conditions",
    "@xmath17 we obtain instead an ` overshooting ' behavior : the scalar field rapidly rolls down the potential and after the kination stage remains frozen at an energy density much smaller than the critical one .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , more complicated dynamics are possible if we relax the hypothesis of considering a single uncoupled scalar .",
    "the presence of several scalars and/or of a small coupling with the dark matter fields could modify the dynamics in such a way that the attractor is reached in time even if we started in the overshooting region .",
    "consider a potential of the form @xmath18 , with m a constant of dimension mass . in this case , the two fields dynamics enlarges the range of possible initial conditions for obtaining a quintessential behavior today .",
    "this is due to the fact that the presence of more scalars allows to play with the initial conditions in the fields values , while maintaining the total initial scalar energy density fixed .",
    "doing so , it is possible to obtain a situation in which for a fixed @xmath19 in the overshooting region , if we keep initially @xmath20 we actually produce an overshooting behavior , while if we choose to start with @xmath21 ( and _ the same _ @xmath19 ) it is possible to reach the attractor in time .",
    "suppose , instead , that the quintessence scalar is not completely decoupled from the rest of the universe . among the possible interactions ,",
    "two interesting cases are the following : @xmath22 if we add @xmath23 or @xmath24 to @xmath25 , the potential will acquire a ( time - dependent ) minimum and the scalar field will be prevented from running freely to infinity . in this way , the long freezing phase that characterizes the evolution of a scalar field with initial conditions in the overshooting region can be avoided .",
    "a more detailed discussion , together with numerical examples , can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "a different possibility arises if we consider quintessence models in the framework of scalar - tensor ( st ) theories of gravity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these theories represent a natural framework in which massless scalars may appear in the gravitational sector of the theory without being phenomenologically dangerous , since they assume a metric coupling of matter with the scalar field , thus ensuring the equivalence principle and the constancy of all non - gravitational coupling constants @xcite . moreover a large class of these models exhibit an attractor mechanism towards gr @xcite , that is , the expansion of the universe during the matter dominated era tends to drive the scalar fields toward a state where the theory becomes indistinguishable from gr .",
    "st theories of gravity are defined , in the so  called ` jordan ' frame , by the action @xmath26 \\ , .",
    "\\label{jordan}\\ ] ] the matter fields @xmath27 are coupled only to the metric tensor @xmath28 and not to @xmath29 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "each st model is identified by the two functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the matter energy - momentum tensor is conserved , masses and non - gravitational couplings are time independent , and in a locally inertial frame non gravitational physics laws take their usual form .",
    "thus , the ` jordan ' frame variables @xmath33 and @xmath29 are also denoted as the ` physical ' ones in the literature . by means of a conformal transformation , @xmath34 with @xmath35 it is possible to go the ` einstein ' frame in which the gravitational action takes the standard form , while matter couples to @xmath36 only through a purely metric coupling , @xmath37 \\,\\,\\ , .\\ ] ] in this frame masses and non - gravitational coupling constants are field - dependent , and the energy - momentum tensor of matter fields is not conserved separately , but only when summed with the scalar field one . on the other hand , the einstein frame planck mass @xmath38 is time - independent and the field equations have the simple form @xmath39 when @xmath40 the scalar field is decoupled from ordinary matter and the st theory is indistinguishable from ordinary gr . the effect of the early presence of a scalar field on the physical processes will come through the jordan - frame hubble parameter @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the einstein frame hubble parameter .",
    "a very attractive class of models is that in which the function @xmath44 has a zero with a positive slope , since this point , corresponding to gr , is an attractive fixed point for the field equation of motion @xcite .",
    "it was emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite that the fixed point starts to be effective around matter - radiation equivalence , and that it governs the field evolution until recent epochs , when the quintessence potential becomes dominant . if the latter has a run - away behavior , the same should be true for @xmath44 , so that the late - time behavior converges to gr .",
    "for this reason , we will consider the following choice , a()=1 + b e^- , ( ) = - b e^-/(1 + b e^- ) , [ alphaphi ] which has a run - away behavior with positive slope .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was calculated the effect of st on the jordan - frame hubble parameter @xmath45 at the time of wimp decoupling , imposing on the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 the constraints coming from gr test , cmb observations and bbn .",
    "computing the ratio @xmath48 at the decoupling time of a typical wimp of mass @xmath49  gev , it was found that it is possible to produce an enhancement of the expansion rate up to @xmath50 . as a further step ,",
    "it was performed the calculation of the relic abundance of a dm wimp with mass @xmath51 and annihilation cross - section @xmath52 .",
    "the effect of the modified st gravity enters the computation of particle physics processes ( like the wimp relic abundance ) through the `` physical '' expansion rate @xmath45 defined in eq .",
    "( [ htilde ] ) .",
    "we have therefore implemented the standard boltzmann equation with the modified physical hubble parameter @xmath45 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the entropy density and @xmath56 is the wimp density per comoving volume .     numerical solution of the boltzmann equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) in a st cosmology for a toy  model of a dm wimp of mass @xmath57 gev and constant annihilation cross - section @xmath58 gev@xmath59 .",
    "the temperature evolution of the wimp abundance @xmath60 clearly shows that freeze  out is anticipated , since the expansion rate of the universe is largely enhanced by the presence of the scalar field @xmath61 . at a value @xmath62",
    "a re  annihilation phase occurs and @xmath60 drops to the present day value . ]",

    "however , we note that a peculiar effect emerges : when the st theory approached gr ( a fact which is parametrized by @xmath63 at a temperature @xmath64 , which in our model is 0.1 gev ) , @xmath65 rapidly drops below the interaction rate @xmath1 establishing a short period during which the already frozen wimps are still abundant enough to start a sizeable re  annihilation .",
