    "the observed correlation between gas and star formation rate surface densities ( the ` star formation law ' ) is one of the most widely used scaling relations in extragalactic astronomy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , its connection to the fundamental units of star formation , molecular clouds and young stellar clusters , remains poorly understood .",
    "on the one hand , averaged over substantial areas of a galaxy , the surface density of gas correlates well with the amount of recently formed stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , in the milky way giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , the birthplace of most stars , and  regions , the ionized ism regions around ( young ) massive stars ,",
    "are observed to be distinct objects .",
    "while they are often found near one another , the radiation fields , stellar winds , and ultimately supernovae make  regions and young clusters hostile to their parent clouds on small ( @xmath10@xmath11  pc ) scales .",
    "thus , while correlated on galactic scales , young stars and molecular gas are in fact anti - correlated on very small scales .",
    "the details of the transition between these two regimes remain largely unexplored ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "recent observations of nearby galaxies have identified a particularly tight correlation between the distributions of _ molecular _ gas ( ) and recent star formation on @xmath10kpc scales @xcite .",
    "while the exact details of the relation are still somewhat uncertain , in the disks of spiral galaxies the parametrization seems to be a power law , @xmath12 , with power law index @xmath13 and coefficient @xmath14 corresponding to  depletion times of @xmath10@xmath15  gyr in normal spirals .",
    "both parts of this relation , the surface densities of  and recent star formation , resolve into discrete objects : gmcs and  regions , young associations , and clusters . in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether the @xmath10kpc -sfr relation is a property of these individual regions or a consequence of averaging over large portions of a galactic disk ( and the accompanying range of evolutionary states and physical properties ) .",
    "to do so , we compare co and extinction - corrected h@xmath2 at high spatial resolution in the nearby spiral galaxy m33 . we examine how the ratio of co - to - h@xmath2 changes as a function of region targeted and spatial scale .",
    "m33 is a natural target for this experiment : it has favorable orientation and is close enough that peaks in the co and h@xmath2 maps approximately correspond to individual massive gmcs @xcite and  regions @xcite .    perhaps not surprisingly , we find that the ratio of  luminosity ( a measure of the molecular gas mass ) to extinction - corrected  flux ( a measure of the star formation rate ) depends on the choice of aperture and spatial scale of the observations .",
    "after describing how we estimate  masses and the recent star formation rate ( section  [ sec : data ] ) and outlining our methodology ( section  [ sec : methodology ] ) , we show the dependence of the depletion times on spatial scale and region targeted ( section  [ sec : results ] )",
    ". then we explore physical explanations for these results ( section  [ sec : disc ] ) .",

    "the data cover a wide bandpass , only a small portion of which contains the co line . as a result ,",

    "we choose to remove this diffuse component from the h@xmath2 map and any discussion of  emission in the following analysis refers to this dig - subtracted map ( we assess the impact of this step in the appendix ) .",
    "we do so using the following method from @xcite .",

    "@xcite argue that this diffuse emission accounts for @xmath10@xmath54 of all @xmath38  emission in m33 . to isolate @xmath38  emission originating directly from  regions",
    ", we follow a similar approach to that used to remove dig from the  map .",
    "the key difference is that instead of trying to identify all @xmath38  bright sources by filtering and applying a cut - off to the @xmath38  emission , we use the existing locations of  regions to isolate any local @xmath38  excess associated with  regions .",
    "we extinction - correct the dig - subtracted  emission using only this local excess in @xmath38  emission .",

    "this automated approach allows us to use the same technique on both maps to find peaks matched in scale to our smallest aperture ( @xmath9  pc ) .",
    "it is also easily reproducible and extensible to other galaxies .",
    "this algorithm operates as follows : we identify all contiguous regions above a certain intensity  the local @xmath27 in the co map and @xmath10@xmath64  erg  s@xmath65  kpc@xmath66 in the corrected  map ( @xmath10@xmath67  m@xmath68  yr@xmath65  kpc@xmath66 following equation [ eq : sfr ] ) .",
    "we reject small regions ( area less than @xmath10@xmath69  arcsec@xmath70 , which correspond to @xmath10@xmath71  pc@xmath70 at the distance of m33 ) as potentially spurious ; the remaining regions are expanded by @xmath30  ( @xmath10@xmath72  pc ) in radius to include any low intensity envelopes .",

    "there is a good correspondence , with @xmath75 of the @xmath76 known gmcs and the 150 brightest  regions lying within @xmath10@xmath52  ( 3 pixels ) of one of our regions .      for a series of scales @xmath77",
    ", we center an aperture of diameter @xmath77 on each co and  peak and then measure fluxes within that aperture to obtain a mass of  ( @xmath78 ) and a star formation rate ( sfr ) .",

    "the low snr of the co data requires a more complex analysis .",
    "we assume that all regions with surface densities above @xmath11  ( @xmath10@xmath92 @xmath93 ) in the integrated co map contain true signal .",
    "we generate a noise map correlated on the ( @xmath94 ) spatial scale of our co data and scale this noise map according to the square root of the number of channels along each line of sight in our masked co cube ( typically @xmath95 ) .",
    "then we add all emission from the pixels above @xmath11  .",
    "finally , we re - identify peaks in the new maps and re - measure @xmath78 and sfr in each region .",

    "figure [ f2 ] shows a well - known result for m33 . there is a strong correlation ( rank correlation coefficient of @xmath96 ) between the surface densities of sfr and  at 1200 pc scales .",
    "power law fits to the different samples ( types of peaks ) and monte carlo iterations yield  depletion times , @xmath97 , of @xmath10@xmath98  gyr ( at  surface densities of @xmath99  ) and power law indices of @xmath10@xmath100 .",
    "these results ( modulo some renormalization due to different assumptions ) match those of @xcite and @xcite in their studies of the star formation law in m33 .",
    "the important point here is that there is good evidence for an internal h@xmath101-sfr surface density relation in m33 .",
    "we plot the median @xmath3 as a function of scale ( aperture size ) in figure  [ f3 ] , giving results for apertures centered on co ( red circles ) and h@xmath2 ( blue stars ) peaks seperately . for the largest scales ,",
    "we find a similar @xmath3 for both sets of apertures ( as was evident from figure [ f2 ] ) .",
    "going to smaller aperture sizes , @xmath3 becomes a strong function of scale and type of peak targeted .",
    "small apertures centered on co peaks have very long @xmath3 ( up to 10 gyr ) .",
    "small apertures targeted toward h@xmath2 peaks have very short @xmath3 ( @xmath102  gyr ) .",
    "this may not be surprising , given the expectations that we outlined in section  [ sec : intro ] and the distinctness of the bright  and co distributions seen in the lower left panel of figure  [ f1 ] , but the dramatic difference as one goes from @xmath10kpc to @xmath10@xmath34  pc scales is nonetheless striking .",
    "a few caveats apply to figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "first , in subtracting the diffuse emission ( dig ) from the  map , we removed @xmath10@xmath103 of the flux .",
    "this could easily include faint regions associated with co peaks , which instead show up as zeros in our map .",
    "perhaps more importantly , we use the @xmath38  map _ only _ to correct the dig - subtraced  map for extinction . any completely embedded star formation will therefore be missed . for both of these reasons ,",
    "the sfr associated with the red points , while it represents our best guess , may be biased somewhat low and certainly reflects emission from relatively evolved regions  those regions that have  fluxes above our dig - cutoff value .",
    "there is no similar effect for the co map .",
    "figure [ f3 ] implies that there is substantial movement of points in the star formation law parameter space as we zoom in to higher resolution on one set of peaks or another .",
    "figure [ f4 ] shows this behavior , plotting the median @xmath1 and median @xmath0 for each set of apertures ( n.b . , the ratio of median @xmath0 to median @xmath1 does not have to be identical to the median @xmath3 ; the difference is usually @xmath104 ) .",
    "we plot only medians because individual data are extremely uncertain , include many upper limits , and because we are primarily interested in the systematic effects of resolution on data in this parameter space .",
    "apertures centered on co peaks ( red points ) have approximately constant , regardless of resolution .",
    "this can be explained if emission in the  map is homogeneously distributed as compared to the position of co peaks .",
    "meanwhile there is a strong change in  for decreasing aperture sizes on the same peaks ; @xmath0 goes up as the bright region fills more and more of the aperture .",
    "a similar effect can be seen for the h@xmath2 ( blue stars ) , though there is more evolution in  with increasing resolution because most bright h@xmath2 regions also show some excess in co emission .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows that by zooming in on an individual star - forming region , one loses the ability to recover the star formation law observed on large scales . for apertures",
    "@xmath7  pc in size , the relative amounts of co emission and  intensity vary systematically as a function of scale and what type of region one focuses on .",
    "another simple way to put this , demonstrated in figure [ f4 ] , is that scatter orthogonal to the sfr - h@xmath101 relation increases with increasing resolution .",
    "eventually this washes out the scaling seen on large scales and the star formation law may be said to `` break down '' .",
    "what is the origin of this scale dependence ? in principle one can imagine at least six sources of scale dependence in the star formation law :    1 .",
    "statistical fluctuations due to noise in the maps",
    "feedback effects of stars on their parent clouds .",
    "3 .   drift of young stars from their parent clouds .",
    "4 .   region - to - region variations in the efficiency of star formation .",
    "time - evolution of individual regions . 6 .",
    "region - to - region variations in how observables map to physical quantities .",
    "our observations are unlikely to be driven by any of the first three effects . in principle , statistical fluctuations could drive the identification of h@xmath2 and co peaks leading to a signal similar to figure [ f3 ] purely from noise",
    ". however , our monte carlo calculations , the overall snr in the maps , and the match to previous region identifications make it clear that this is not the case .",
    "photoionization by young stars can produce co shells around  regions inside of a larger cloud or complex .",
    "this is a clear case of a small - scale offset between h@xmath2 and co. however , the physical scales in figure [ f3 ] are too large for this effect to have much impact , it should occur on scales more like @xmath10@xmath11  pc .",
    "similarly , the scales over which @xmath3 diverges between co and h@xmath2 peaks ( @xmath105 pc ) are probably too large to be produced by drift between young stars and their parent cloud .",
    "a typical internal gmc velocity dispersion in m33 is a few km  s@xmath65 ( @xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "over an average cloud lifetime ( @xmath10@xmath26  myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this implies a drift of at most @xmath34  pc .",
    "this extreme case is just large enough to register in our plot but unlikely to drive the signal we see at scales of @xmath106 pc .",
    "see @xcite for a similar consideration of gmcs and  filaments .",
    "instead of drifts or offsets , what we observe is simply a lack of direct correspondence between the co and  luminosities of individual star - forming regions",
    ". the brightest @xmath39 co peaks are simply not identical to the brightest @xmath39  peaks .",
    "the bottom right panel of figure [ f1 ] shows this clearly ; about a third of the peaks in m33 are nearer to another peak of their own type ( i.e. , co to co or h@xmath2 to h@xmath2 ) than to a peak of the other type .",
    "thus figure [ f3 ] shows that the ratio of co to  emission varies dramatically among star - forming regions . in this case",
    "the size scale on the @xmath107-axis in figure  [ f3 ] is actually a proxy for the number of regions inside the aperture . in m33 ,",
    "apertures of @xmath9  pc diameter usually contain a single peak . at @xmath39",
    "pc , this is still the case @xmath10@xmath108 of the time , and at @xmath81  pc only a few regions are included in each aperture .    why does the ratio of co - to - h@xmath2 vary so strongly from region - to - region ?",
    "the efficiency with which gas form stars may vary systematically from region to region ( with high h@xmath2 peaks being high - efficiency regions ) , star - forming regions may undergo dramatic changes in their properties as they evolve ( with h@xmath2 peaks being evolved regions ) , or the mapping of observables to physical quantities ( equations [ eq : xco ] and [ eq : sfr ] ) may vary from region to region .",
    "it is difficult to rule out region - to - region efficiency variations , but there is also no strong evidence for them .",
    "@xcite looked for systematic variations in @xmath3 as a function of a number of environmental factors and found little evidence for any systematic trends .",
    "@xcite suggested that the cloud free - fall time determines @xmath3 to first order , but based on @xcite , the dynamic range in free - fall times for m33 clouds is low . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found unusually low values of @xmath3 in the outer disk of m33 .",
    "there is strong evidence for evolution of star - forming regions .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that in the lmc , the amount of h@xmath2 and young stars associated with a gmc evolves significantly across its lifetime . in our opinion",
    "this is the most likely explanation for the behavior in figure [ f3 ] .",
    "star - forming regions undergo a very strong evolution from quiescent cloud , to cloud being destroyed by  region , to exposed cluster or association .",
    "when an aperture contains only a few regions , @xmath3 for that aperture will be set by the evolutionary state of the regions inside it .",
    "that state will in turn determine whether the aperture is identified as a co peak or an h@xmath2 peak .",
    "co peaks will preferentially select sites of heavily embedded or future star formation while  peaks are relatively old regions that formed massive stars a few myr ago .",
    "region - to - region variations in the mapping of observables ( co and h@xmath2 ) to physical quantities ( h@xmath101 mass and sfr ) are expected .",
    "let us assume for the moment that the ratio of h@xmath101 to sfr is constant and independent of scale .",
    "then to explain the strong scale dependence of the ratio of co to h@xmath2 in figure [ f3 ] there would need to be much more  per unit co near h@xmath2 peaks and many more recently formed stars per ionizing photon near the co peaks . at least some of these effects have been claimed : e.g. , @xcite find a strong dependence of  on radiation field and @xcite suggest that incomplete sampling of the imf in regions with low sfrs drive the differences they observe between star formation tracers . however , both claims are controversial and it seems very contrived to invoke a scenario where only this effect drives the breakdown in figure [ f3 ]",
    ". it seems more plausible that the mapping of observables to physical quantities represents a secondary source of scatter correlated with the evolutionary state of a region ( e.g. , the age of the stellar population ) .",
    "we argue that the behavior seen in figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] comes from averaging together regions in different states . here",
    "we implement a simple model to demonstrate that such an effect can reproduce the observed behavior .",
    "the model is as follows : we consider a population of regions .",
    "we randomly assign each region to be an ``  peak '' or a `` co peak '' with equal chance of each .",
    "co peaks have @xmath109 times as much co as  and  peaks have @xmath109 times as much  as co ( roughly driven by the difference between the results for @xmath9  pc apertures in table  [ tab : tdep ] ) .",
    "physically , the idea is simply to build a population of regions that is an equal mix `` young '' ( high co - to- ) and `` old '' ( low co - to- ) . dropping an aperture to contain only a young ( co peak ) or old ( h@xmath2 peak ) region will recover our results at @xmath9  pc scales by construction .",
    "next we average each of our original region with another , new region ( again randomly determined to be either a co or  peak ) .",
    "we add the co and  emission of the two region together , record the results .",
    "we then add a third region ( again randomly young or old ) , and so on .",
    "the result is a prediction for the ratio of co to  as a function of two quantities : 1 ) the number of regions added together and 2 ) the type of the first region ( co or  peak ) .",
    "using the average number of regions per aperture listed in table  [ tab : tdep ] and normalizing to an average depletion time of 1 gyr , we then have a prediction for @xmath3 as a function of scale .",
    "this appears as the diamond symbols and dashed lines in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "given the simplicity of the model , the agreement between observations and model in figure [ f3 ] is good .",
    "our observations can apparently be explained largely as the result of averaging together star - forming regions in distinct evolutionary states . at scales where a single region dominates , the observed @xmath3 is a function of the state of that region . as more regions are included , @xmath3 just approaches the median value for the system .",
    "the star formation law apparently breaks down ( or at least includes a large amount of scatter ) on scales where one resolution element corresponds to an individual star - forming region .",
    "the spatial resolution at which this occurs will vary from system to system according to the space density of star - forming regions in the system .",
    "the surface densities of star formation and  vary with radius in m33 @xcite .",
    "this allows us to break the galaxy into two regions , a high surface density inner part ( @xmath110  kpc ) and a low surface density outer part ( @xmath111  kpc ) .",
    "we measure the scale dependence of @xmath3 for each region in the same way that we did for all data .",
    "an important caveat is that the dig subtraction becomes problematic for the outer region , removing a number of apparently real but low - brightness  regions from the map .",
    "we achieve the best results for large radii with the dig subtraction is turned off and report those numbers here .",
    "the basic result of a larger - scale of divergence in the outer disk remains the same with the dig subtraction on or off .",
    "we find the expected result , that @xmath3 for co and h@xmath2 peaks diverges at larger spatial scales in the outer disk than the inner disk . in both cases",
    "the ratio of @xmath3 at co peaks to @xmath3 at h@xmath2 peaks is @xmath10@xmath98 for @xmath112  pc apertures . for @xmath80",
    "pc apertures that ratio remains @xmath10@xmath98 in the inner disk but climbs to @xmath10@xmath15 in the outer disk , suggesting that by this time there is already some breakdown in the sfr - h@xmath101 relation . for @xmath81  pc apertures ,",
    "the same ratio is @xmath10@xmath113 in the inner disk and @xmath10@xmath99 in the outer disk .",
    "it thus appears that at large radii in m33 the star formation law breaks down on scales about twice that of the inner disk , though the need to treat the dig inhomogeneously means that this comparison should not be overinterpreted .",
    "our main conclusion is that the molecular star formation law observed in m33 at large scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows substantial scale dependence if one focuses on either co or  peaks .",
    "the median depletion time ( or co - to - h@xmath2 ratio ) measured in a @xmath9  pc diameter aperture ( derived from averaging @xmath10@xmath39 such apertures ) varies by more than an order of magnitude between co and  peaks . at large ( @xmath10kpc ) scales this difference mostly vanishes .",
    "we argue that the scale for the breakdown is set by the spatial separation of high - mass star - forming regions , with the breakdown occurring when an aperture includes only a few such regions in specific evolutionary states ( a scale that corresponds to @xmath10@xmath81  pc in m33 ) .    in this case",
    "the scaling relation between gas and star formation rate surface density observed at large scales does not have its direct origin in an instantaneous cloud - scale relation .",
    "individual gmcs and  regions will exhibit a co - to - h@xmath2 ratio that depends on their evolutionary state ( likely with significant additional stochasticity ) and as a result the @xmath10@xmath39 brightest objects at a given wavelength will be a function of what evolutionary state that observation probes .",
    "this divergence is consistent with recent results from the lmc @xcite indicating that individual gmcs exhibit a range of evolutionary states over their @xmath114 myr lifetime .",
    "this does not mean that comparisons of tracers of recent and future star formation on small scales are useless . to the contrary",
    ", such observations contain critical information about the evolution of individual clouds as a function of time and location that is washed out at large scales ( @xmath115  pc in m33 ) .",
    "however , once one moves into the regime where a single object contributes heavily to each measurement , it is critical to interpret the results in light of the evolution of individual clouds .",
