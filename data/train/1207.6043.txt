    "electronic excitations at finite frequency are a common feature of doped mott or charge - transfer insulators .",

    "it was also realized that considerable transfers of spectral weight in the optical spectra occur and new states arise which generate spectral intensity within the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "@xcite these studies have shown that the key assumption of the fermi liquid theory that the low - energy excitation spectrum stands in a one - to - one correspondence with that of a non - interacting system has to be revised when the electrons interact strongly .",
    "for instance , drastic deviations from the fermi liquid picture are obtained , in the normal state of the copper - oxide high - temperature superconductors , highlighted by a pseudogap , broad spectral features , and the resistivity which increases linearly with temperature . @xcite it was recently established that the optical conductivity for cuo@xmath6 planes of high temperature superconductors exhibits a mid - infrared peak at low doping that gradually develops to a band under increasing doping and causes an insulator - to - metal transition.@xcite    optical conductivity studies play also a very important role in other correlated materials , including mott insulators with active orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "these systems exhibit rather complex behavior due to the interrelation between spin , orbital and charge degrees of freedom .",

    "recently a two - peak structure of the optical conductivity was discussed for the metallic phase of fm manganites , @xcite with a far - infrared drude peak accompanied by a broad mid - infrared polaron peak .",
    "it is intriguing whether similar phenomena occur in other orbital systems as well .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the optical conductivity in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) orbital model with two active @xmath0 orbital flavors .",
    "this model reveals crucial properties we are interested in , and is applicable either to transition metal oxides with fm planes and active @xmath0 orbitals when the tetragonal crystal field splits off the @xmath14 orbital from the @xmath15 doublet filled by one electron at each site , as for instance in sr@xmath6vo@xmath16,@xcite or to certain @xmath1 planar materials such as k@xmath6cuf@xmath16 or cs@xmath6agf@xmath16,@xcite or to cold - atom systems @xcite with active @xmath2 orbitals.@xcite orbital superexchange which arises in the strongly correlated regime is responsible for alternating orbital ( ao ) order at half filling .",

    "the purpose is not to eliminate energetically costly double occupancies , but rather to assess accurately to what extent they contribute to the ground state energy and wave functions.@xcite the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a projection operator that projects the transformed hamiltonian on the low energy hilbert space and removes all states with doubly occupied sites .",

    "[ bands](a ) have practically no spectral weight  as will be seen below , however , these bands give a dominant contribution to the optical conductivity .",
    "the spectral weight of the lowest peak  which would form the quasiparticle band at finite doping  shows a weak @xmath90-dependence which can be understood as follows : for momenta near the minimum ( maximum ) of the dispersion , the hole gains ( looses ) energy by propagation . since the dominant mechanism of propagation is the hopping of the bare hole via the three - site hopping term ( [ h3sl ] )  see the transition between states in fig .",

    "thus , it seems that the only channel allowing for hole propagation is due to the hamiltonian induced coupling between states representing a hole created in the @xmath36 state , as the states depicted in figs . [ strings](b ) and",
    "[ strings](d ) .",
    "this kind of hopping is mediated by the small @xmath150 term ( [ h3sl ] ) .",
    "we proceed now to provide the justification of that statement when restricted to the low energy sector of the hilbert space , i.e. , consisting of states with limited number of flipped orbitals in the @xmath36 state .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix represented in terms of states @xmath151 consists of two decoupled blocks . the first ( second ) block",
    "is formed by states coupled with the state representing a hole created in the perfect @xmath36 state at a site belonging to the sublattice @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) . despite that both blocks show explicit dependence on both @xmath152 , the energies of eigenstates for each block disperse along a single direction , either ( 10 ) or ( 01 ) in the 2d brillouin zone .    by representing the hamiltonian matrix in terms of @xmath153 ) , the hamiltonian matrix lacks any dependence on momentum , which shows that the hole deconfinement occurs here solely due to that term and that the hole becomes confined when @xmath35 is set to zero .",
    "those findings are restricted to the basis considered by us which is limited by the path length .",
    "furthermore , we do not probe the part of the hilbert space which is not coupled by a hamiltonian power to original states , representing a hole created in the @xmath36 state .",
    "thus , a general mathematical proof of the hypothesis regarding the nature of the propagation and valid for the whole hilbert space is still needed .    to identify the origin of optical transitions contributing to the spectrum depicted in fig .",
    "[ sab ] , we analyze now the properties of the hamiltonian matrix represented in terms of states ( [ newpropstat ] ) [ i.e. , in the case when the original hole position is used to label string states ] , when @xmath35 is set to @xmath112 , which means that only the `` fast '' part of the hamiltonian is considered .",
    "it turns out that this part determines the overall structure of the energy - band hierarchy . due to the lack of energy dispersion the bands are now completely flat , but their positions correspond very well to the sequence of bands obtained for finite @xmath35 and shown in fig . [ bands ] .",
    "the picture which emerges from that correspondence is that the physics of hole hopping in the orbitally ordered background at large energy scale is determined by fast moves to nn sites , accompanied by the creation of defects in the orbital arrangement . due to the increasing length of defect sequences ( strings )",
    "a hole behaves like a particle in a potential well .",
    "consequently , band hierarchy corresponds to the sequence of eigenenergies for the corresponding problem of the particle in the well . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy dispersion is determined by `` slow '' hopping which brings about the modification at the energy scale @xmath154 and can be viewed as a perturbation introduced on top of the robust structure of eigenstates arising for the potential - well problem . for finite @xmath35",
    ", the hamiltonian matrix block formed by states coupled with the state representing a hole removed from the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) sublattice in the @xmath36 state does not show any dependence on @xmath155 ( @xmath80 ) , which explicitly demonstrates that the hole propagation is 1d .     with the original state of a hole doped in the ao state shown in fig .",

    "hopping process @xmath3 from site @xmath47 to site @xmath71 , the hole hops downwards by the effective hopping @xmath35 and leaves behind an island of excited bonds ( a ) .",
    "further hopping of the hole by either ( b ) one @xmath3 step , or ( c ) two @xmath3 steps , generates more defects in the @xmath36 state .",

    "the brillouin zone gets folded due to the staggered form of the ao order and all parameters like the energy are periodic with the periodicity @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the bottom of the lowest energy band lies on the lines @xmath158 and @xmath159 ( and on lines equivalent by symmetry ) for two orthogonal directions of the 1d hole propagation , respectively . within the single particle approximation which we apply here ,",
    "the mott insulator doped with holes starts to fill orbital polaron bands near their bottoms . even for nonzero @xmath35",
    "the hamiltonian blocks represented in the basis of states ( [ newpropstat ] ) are fully symmetric with respect to the point group @xmath133 for wave vectors lying at the band bottom . for example",
    ", the block in the sector consisting of states lacking dispersion in the @xmath160 direction is symmetric at the wave vector @xmath158 with respect to the reflection in the @xmath40 axis , as it lacks the dependence on @xmath80 .",
