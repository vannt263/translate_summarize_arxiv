    "for example , perturbation theory on the matrix @xmath5 has been carried out in @xcite and @xcite for estimating the number of factors in a large dimensional factor model of type @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a @xmath1-dimensional sequence observed at time @xmath19 , @xmath20 a sequence of @xmath21-dimensional `` latent factor '' ( @xmath22 ) uncorrelated with the error process @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the general mean .",

    "has been established in @xcite using the method of stieltjes transform and in @xcite using the moment method .",
    "the latter paper also establishes the almost sure convergence of the largest singular value of @xmath5 to the right edge of the lsd , thanks to the moment method .",
    "related results are also proposed in @xcite where the sequence @xmath14 is replaced by a more general time series .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the same questions as in @xcite but under a different asymptotic regime , the so - called _ ultra - dimensional regime _ where @xmath29 it is naturally expected that the limit under this regime will be much different than under the mp regime above .",
    "the findings of the paper confirm this difference by providing a new limit of the singular value distribution of @xmath5 under the ultra - dimensional regime .    in a related paper @xcite",
    ", the authors also adopted the ultra - dimensional regime to derive the lsd for a large class of separable sample covariance matrices .",
    "however , the autocovariance matrix @xmath5 considered in this paper is very different of these separable sample covariance matrices .    recalling the definition of @xmath26 in",
    ", we have @xmath30 it follows by simple calculations that @xmath31 and for @xmath32 , @xmath33 the row sum of the variances @xmath34 is thus of order @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , in order to have the spectrum of @xmath26 be of constant order when @xmath36 , we should normalise it as @xmath37    the main results of the paper are as follows . first in section  [ lsd ] , we derive the almost sure limit of the singular value distribution of @xmath38 under the ultra - dimensional regime and assuming that the fourth moment of the entries @xmath39 are uniformly bounded .",
    "this limit ( lsd ) simply equals to the image measure of the semi - circle law on @xmath40 $ ] by the absolute value transformation @xmath41 .",
    "next in section  [ largest ] , we establish the almost sure convergence of the largest singular value of @xmath38 to 2 assuming that the entries @xmath39 has a uniformly bounded moment of order @xmath42 for some @xmath43 .",
    "both results are derived using the moment method .",
    "some technical details on the traditional truncation and renormalisation steps are postponed to the appendixes .",
    "in this section , we show that when @xmath36 , the esd of the singular values of @xmath44 tends to a nonrandom limit , which is linked to the well known semi - circle law .",
    "[ singularlsd ] suppose the following conditions hold :    * @xmath45 is a sequence of independent @xmath1-dimensional real valued random vectors with independent entries @xmath46 , @xmath47 , satisfying @xmath48 * both @xmath1 and @xmath16 tend to infinity in a related way such that @xmath36",

    "it is also worth noticing that if there were no lag , i.e. @xmath51 , the matrix @xmath5 would be a standard sample covariance matrix ; and in this case the spectral distribution of @xmath52 would converge to the semi - circle law , see @xcite .",
    "the case of a auto - covariance matrix @xmath5 with a positive lag @xmath53 is then very different .",
    "since the singular values of @xmath49 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath54 , in the remaining of this paper , we focus on the limiting behaviours of the eigenvalues of @xmath54 .",

    "it follows from these assertions that almost surely , @xmath75 for all @xmath76 .",
    "since the limiting moment sequence @xmath77 clearly satisfies the carleman s condition , i.e. @xmath78 , we deduce that almost surely , the sequence of esds @xmath68 weakly converges to a probability measure @xmath59 whose moments are exactly @xmath77 .",
