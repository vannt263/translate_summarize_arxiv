    "topological defects are ubiquitous in many branches of physics , spanning from condensed matter physics @xcite to cosmology @xcite .",

    "liquid crystalline phases , such as nematics , are prototypical for showing topological defects , such as point hedgehogs and disclination lines @xcite .",
    "topological arguments show that _ within the bulk _ and in 3d the only stable disclination lines have @xmath2 winding number @xcite .",
    "the presence of substrates may induce the nucleation of disclinations with other winding numbers .",
    "theoretically , non - half - integer disclination lines are predicted to nucleate in the cusps ( wedges and/or apexes ) of substrates @xcite , as well as in sharp boundaries between domains characterised by different anchoring conditions in flat surfaces @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is some experimental evidence of the formation of these unusal non - half - integer disclination lines on surfaces @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the nematic director field in presence of structured substrates may be distorted , leading to an elastic contribution to the free energy . since the seminal work by berreman @xcite ,",
    "this problem has been extensively studied and generalized in the literature @xcite . however , most of these studies focussed on smooth substrates or on the effect of isolated cusps . in this paper",
    "we will consider the effect that the disclination lines nucleating on the cups of the substrates have on the elastic contribution to the surface free energy of the nematic on periodic and cusped structures .",
    "in particular , we will consider a sawtoothed substrate which favors homeotropic anchoring .",
    "other geometries may also be considered with our formalism , such as step - like substrates , which have been studied numerically and experimentally in the context of zenithal bistable switching in nematic devices @xcite .",
    "we will show that the disclination lines induce a contribution to the elastic contribution to the free energy density ( per unit projected area ) which depends only on the geometric characteristics of the substrate , and that scales with the wavenumber @xmath1 associated to the periodicity of the substrate as @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the different models for the nematic in the presence of a sawtooth substrate are presented in section ii .",
    "we focus in particular on substrates which favor homeotropic anchoring and their consequences . in section iii",
    "we report the numerical and analytical results obtained from these approaches . in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a nematic phase in contact with a sawtooth substrate characterized by an angle @xmath4 and a side length @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . at the substrate",
    "the nematic molecules preferentially align homeotropically , i.e. parallel to the local normal to the substrate .",
    "the system is translationally invariant along the out - of - plane axis @xmath6 and periodic along the @xmath7 axis .",
    "we will only consider azimuthal distortions for the nematic director @xmath8 , which can be parametrized in terms of the angle @xmath9 between the director and the @xmath10 direction as @xmath11 .",
    "out - of - plane or twist deformations may also be important under other conditions , as a twist instability may occur  @xcite , but we checked numerically they are not relevant for our choice of parameters as free - energy minimization always leads to azimuthal distorted textures . finally we impose that , far from the substrate , the bulk nematic phase orients homogeneously either along @xmath7 ( the @xmath12 texture ) or the @xmath10 direction ( the @xmath13 texture ) , which are the only relevant situations allowed by symmetry considerations .",
    "we study the orientational ordering of this system within two different models : the landau - de gennes ( ldg ) model and the frank - oseen ( fo ) model .      in the ldg model , both isotropic and nematic phases",
    "can be locally represented by a traceless , symmetric order - parameter tensor with components @xmath14 , which can be represented as @xmath15 + \\frac 1 2 b [ l_il_j - m_i m_j]$ ] , where @xmath16 are the cartesian components of the director field @xmath8 , @xmath17 is the nematic order parameter which measures the orientational ordering along the nematic director , and @xmath18 is the biaxiality parameter , which measures the ordering of the molecules on the orientations perpendicular to @xmath8 , characterized by the eigenvectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "if we will rescale all the variables as follows @xcite : @xmath31 , the positions @xmath32 , where the correlation length @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , we get that @xmath36 , with rescaled free energy densities : @xmath37 ^ 2&&\\\\ & \\tilde \\phi_{\\mathrm{el } } = \\frac { 1 } { 3 + 2\\kappa}[\\tilde \\partial_k { \\tilde q_{ij}}\\tilde \\partial_k { \\tilde q_{ij}}+   \\kappa \\tilde \\partial_j   { \\tilde q_{ij}}\\tilde \\partial_k \\tilde q_{ik } ] & & \\\\ & \\tilde \\phi_{\\mathrm{surf } } = - \\frac 2 3 \\tilde w \\operatorname{tr}[\\tilde { \\mathbf{q}}\\cdot\\tilde { \\mathbf{q}}_{\\mathrm{surf}}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 is a dimensionless temperature , @xmath39 is an elastic dimensionless parameter ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 is the dimensionless anchoring strength .",

    "the bulk free - energy density has two minima corresponding to @xmath43 for rescaled scalar order parameters @xmath44 ( isotropic phase ) and @xmath45 ( nematic phase ) , so both phases are at coexistence .",
    "it is important to note that the order parameter @xmath17 in the coexisting nematic phase is rescaled , so its value in real units is @xmath46 , which must be smaller than 1 ( typically @xmath47 ) .",
    "if the elastic parameter @xmath48 is positive ( negative ) , the nematic prefers to align parallel ( perpendicular ) to a possible nematic - isotropic interface .",
    "finally , @xmath49 defines the favored tensor at the substrate .",
    "we will favor a homeotropic alignment of the nematic by setting @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the normal vector to the substrate , establishing a direct connection to previous papers @xcite .",
    "hereafter we will restrict ourselves to the nematic phase at the nematic - isotropic ( ni ) transition ( @xmath42 ) , with @xmath52 .     and the angle @xmath4 . ]",
    "the fo model can be considered as an approximation to the ldg model , in which we assume that the variations of the nematic order parameter are restricted to the neighbourhood of the substrate ( with a width of order of @xmath33 ) and inside defect cores , and takes the bulk value @xmath17 elsewhere .",
    "assuming there are no disclination lines in the bulk , substitution of this ansatz into the ldg free - energy functional leads to the following fo approach for large @xmath5 ( in units of @xmath33 ) : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total volume of the nematic , @xmath55 is the substrate area in contact with the nematic , the elastic constant @xmath56 and @xmath57 is an effective anchoring potential to be determined in the following that is due to the nematic order parameter distorsions close to the substrates .    in order to make a quantitative comparison with the results within the ldg model , instead of considering an _ ad hoc _ expression for the anchoring potential , we will derive it from the ldg model .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the nematic order parameter distortions are assumed to be confined to a layer of width @xmath58 close to the substrates . on the other hand ,",
    "the variations of the nematic director field close to the walls are rather small in directions parallel to the surfaces for large @xmath5 ( except close to the wedges and apexes ) .",
    "so , we may estimate @xmath57 as the ldg excess free energy per unit area of a slab of width @xmath59 , for which , at the boundary @xmath60 , we impose a surface field @xmath24 , and for @xmath61 we consider a bulk nematic phase with an uniform nematic director characterized by a tilt angle @xmath9 with respect to the @xmath10 axis . fig .",
