    "weak convergence of scaled input processes has been studied extensively over the last decade @xcite .",
    "the limit is a fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) or a lvy process depending on the particular scaling . while the motivation of such analysis originates from data traffic in telecommunications , both fbm and lvy processes",
    "have recently become prevalent in finance .",
    "thereby , we construct a general stochastic process based on a poisson random measure @xmath0 , interpret it as stock price process and prove weak convergence results .",
    "we consider a real valued process of the form @xmath1 n_n(ds , du , dr)\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a deterministic function satisfying lipschitz condition , @xmath3 is a scaling sequence , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are marks of the resulting poisson point process with @xmath6 denoting the time .",
    "the mean measure on @xmath7 is either a probability measure or an infinite measure on @xmath8 .",
    "the process @xmath9 depends on the scaling parameter @xmath10 through not only @xmath11 , but also through the mean measure @xmath12 of @xmath13 which is taken to have a regularly varying form in @xmath5 to comply with the long - range dependence property of teletraffic or financial data . after centering the process @xmath9",
    ", we can obtain either an fbm or a stable lvy motion depending on the particular scaling of the mean measure of @xmath13 and the factor @xmath11 as @xmath14 . while fbm is a self - similar and long - range dependent model ,",
    "a lvy process has independent increments and self - similarity exists without long - range dependence .",
    "our main contribution is the generalization of the previous results @xcite with a specific linear form for @xmath2 and @xcite with an increasing @xmath2 satisfying some other technical conditions , to those with lipschitz functions . in this case , not only the proofs require more work , but we need lipschitz assumptions on the derivative of @xmath2 as well . we also show that the time scaling used in previous work can be replaced by parameter scaling of the distributions of the relevant random variables .",
    "the time scaling has been interpreted as ` birds - eye ' description of a process , which is not necessary when the scaling is interpreted in terms of its parameters .",
    "inspired by @xcite , we unify the results for general forms of @xmath2 with less stringent conditions in some cases . in @xcite",
    ", it is noted that a fractional brownian motion with @xmath15 can be approximated if the pulse @xmath2 is continuous on @xmath16 and has a compact support . as an alternative extension ,",
    "we consider continuous @xmath2 with no compact support while constructing ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath17 as a centered process .",
    "a secondary generalization of previous work is the consideration of @xmath18 as a more general process than workload which would be positive by definition .",
    "we allow a signed process through the choice of real valued rate @xmath4 .    in related work @xcite ,",
    "the poisson random measure is replaced by a general arrival process and a cluster poisson process , respectively .",
    "ergodicity is required for the limit theorems in the general arrival case as well . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the previous studies on scaled input processes are named infinite source poisson models due to the assumption of poisson arrivals .    as for application in finance",
    ", the process @xmath9 can be interpreted as the price of a stock .",
    "the interpretation of ( [ 1 ] ) as a stock price process has been first presented in @xcite . our aim is to construct a model involving the behavior of agents that can be parameterized and estimated from data , yet having well - known stochastic processes as its limits .",
    "while the limiting models fit well to financial data , they do not involve the physical parameters of the trading agents .",
    "agent based modeling is widely used to find a model that best fits stock price processes . in some studies",
    ", agents are divided into two groups , mostly named as chartists and fundamentalists . in these studies ,",
    "the two agent groups have different demand functions for the stock @xcite and the price is generally determined via the total excess demand @xcite . in (",
    "[ 1 ] ) , the arrival time @xmath6 , the rate @xmath4 and the duration @xmath5 of the effect of an order are all governed by the poisson random measure . under the assumption of positive correlation between the total net demand and the price change",
    ", we expect that a buy order of an agent increases the price whereas a sell order decreases it .",
    "each order has an effect proportional to its volume and duration .",
    "the duration of the effect is assumed to follow a heavy tailed distribution .",
    "this effect starts when the order is given , increases to a maximum which is proportional to the total order amount , and then starts decreasing until it vanishes after a finite time .",
    "alternatively , its effect may last for some time and leave the price at a changed level on and after the time of transaction .",
    "the logarithm of the stock price is found by aggregating the incremental effects of orders placed by all active agents in @xmath19 $ ] . as a semi - martingale",
    ", our process does not allow for arbitrage .",
    "it is a novel model which is alternative to existing agent based constructions that are semi - markov processes @xcite .",
    "we prove weak convergence results for the two different measures used for the duration , separately . as for their connection ,",
    "the infinite measure being the limit of the probability measure is proved in theorem 1 .",
    "although a probability measure is appropriate for the duration , its limiting form is able to capture the essential tail behavior which represents long - range dependence and self - similarity properties .",
    "moreover , the scalings with the limiting measure is simpler to interpret as follows .",
    "an fbm limit is found as the frequency of trading increases and the price effect of the orders decreases as shown in theorem 3 .",
    "in contrast , a stable process which is a scaled version of a stable lvy motion is obtained in theorem 5 when the rate of trading decreases and the effect of the orders increases .",
    "theorems 2 and 4 are concerned with fbm and stable limits , respectively , for the case of probability measure for the duration .",
    "the hypotheses in these theorems involve extra scaling needed for obtaining the limiting measure in addition to the scaling of the rates and effects .",
    "the stable process obtained in the limit has a skewness parameter that depends on the distribution of the rate @xmath4 as it can take positive or negative values .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define the ingredients of the workload model , namely the random variables associated with the process to be constructed .",
    "the price process is defined in section 3 with various assumptions on the parameters of the poisson random measure .",
    "section 4 includes limit theorems for fractional brownian motion .",
    "finally , limit theorems for stable lvy motion are proved in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we state our main assumptions and notation for constructing a stock price process . we assume potentially an infinite pool of agents and gather the agents trading processes under a poisson random measure .",
    "each agent s trading starts according to the underlying poisson process and it ends after a random amount of time . although the same agents may be returning for further transaction , new arrivals are assumed to be independent and identically distributed .",
    "the agents are called _ infinite source poisson _ as a term borrowed from traffic modeling in telecommunications based on poisson random measures ( e.g. @xcite ) . since self - similarity and long - range dependence are common statistical properties observed in both internet traffic and financial data",
    ", the stochastic models also have similar features .    in @xcite ,",
    "a finite number of identically distributed semi - markov processes representing the trading states of the agents over time are aggregated to form the price process . the number of semi - markov processes , equivalently , the number of agents has been taken to infinity only in the limit . on the other hand ,",
    "our price model is a stationary process with an infinite source of agents that arrive according to a poisson process .",
    "we concentrate on scaling the other parameters that have physical interpretations for obtaining the limiting stochastic processes .",
