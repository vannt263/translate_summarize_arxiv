    "one of the most intriguing open issues in star formation concerns the formation of massive stars ( e.g. zinnecker ; these proceedings ) .",
    "although there is a well - established paradigm for the formation of low mass t tauri stars , namely via magnetospheric accretion , it is as yet unclear whether such a scenario would also apply to the more massive stars . to be able to answer the question whether nature allows the scaling - up of the formation mechanism of the sun to the most massive stars",
    ", it first needs to be established whether the conditions known to prevail in the lower mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) t tauri stars , such as the presence of circumstellar discs and stellar magnetic fields , persist up to the intermediate mass ( 2 - 15 m@xmath1 ) pms herbig ae / be stars .",
    "the question as to whether herbig ae / be stars in general are embedded in circumstellar discs , is still under debate .",
    "although there are clear indications for flattening from millimeter imaging on larger spatial scales ( a few hundred au ) for at least some objects ( mannings & sargent 1997 ) , other studies , probing smaller spatial scales , yield results that seem contradictory .",
    "for instance , the ir interferometry of millan - gabet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) probes scales of only a few au , and in this regime the geometry is found to be rather more spherical . nonetheless , to be able to study the circumstellar geometries around pms stars at the closest spatial scales , one needs to resort to the tool of spectropolarimetry , as this is the only technique that may probe the geometry on scales of stellar radii ( equivalent to @xmath4 0.05 au ) compared to the @xmath5 1 au scales probed by other methods .",
    "in principle , the detection of linear polarization of @xmath4 2 % , would teach us directly that a specific source is non - spherically symmetric on the sky .",
    "however , such a level of polarization may also be due to polarization by dust grains in the interstellar medium operating between the source and the observer .",
    "unfortunately , properly correcting for this interstellar contribution has been proven to be a difficult task ( e.g. mclean & clarke 1979 ) .",
    "this is one of the prime reasons as to why spectrally - resolved polarization changes across emission lines are so valuable , as the interstellar polarization affects the continuum and the line in exactly the same way : any observed change in the polarization across the line has to be intrinsic to the source .",
    "although spectropolarimetry has widely been applied to more evolved early - type stars , such as classical be stars ( e.g poeckert 1975 ) , the technique has only recently been applied to pre - main sequence stars ( oudmaijer & drew 1999 , vink et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) . for classical",
    "be stars , the dominant effect is known to be due to unpolarized line emission in the presence of intrinsic continuum polarization ( e.g. clarke & mclean 1974 ) .",
    "this ` depolarization ' effect across emission lines occurs because the line photons are formed over a larger volume ( in the circumstellar disc ) than the continuum photons and are therefore scattered to a lesser extent off free electrons in the disc than are the continuum photons .",
    "consequently , a drop in the polarization percentage is seen ( see fig  1a for an example ) .    in certain circumstances",
    "however , it is feasible that the converse occurs : a proportion of the _ line _ photons originate from a compact source and are scattered and polarized themselves ( mclean 1979 ; wood et al .",
    "observationally , such effects have only recently been detected in intermediate and low mass herbig ae and t  tauri stars ( vink et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) using medium / high resolution ( @xmath6 @xmath7 8000 ) spectropolarimetry . here",
    ", the h@xmath0  line is believed to be polarized by scattering in a rotating non - spherically symmetric medium , most likely an accretion disc .",
    "examples of both types of line effect , i.e. depolarization versus line polarization , are presented for respectively herbig be and ae stars in sects .",
    "[ s_hbe ] and  [ s_hae ] below .",
    "a polarization spectrum for the herbig be star bd+40  4124 is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , and the observed behaviour across the h@xmath0  line profile in both polarization percentage ( % pol ) and position angle ( pa ) is considered to be consistent with depolarization .",
    "the reason the pa shows a change across the line as well is attributed to the vector addition of the interstellar polarization contribution .",
    "note that the smooth and broad depolarization effect is represented in the @xmath8 diagram of fig .",
    "2(a ) by a more or less linear excursion of the line points out from the dense knot representing the continuum at @xmath9 = ( @xmath100.3,1.25 ) .",
    "the angle between this knot and the linear line excursion is directly related to the direction of the flattening of the presumed electron scattering disc around bd+40  4124 .    in the event that _ all _ herbig be stars are embedded in electron scattering discs , one would not expect a 100% detection rate of h@xmath0  depolarisations , as at least some of the sources would have their discs too `` pole - on '' with respect to the observer to yield a % pol drop large enough to be detectable . to estimate the expected fraction of depolarization detections , we turn to a comparison with classical be stars ( poeckert & marlborough 1976 ) , objects for which the presence of a circumstellar disc is well - established .",
    "applying the same detection threshold to the poeckert & marlborough sample as in ours , we expect a detection rate of about 54% .",
    "returning now to our herbig be star sample , we find that 7 out of 12 ( i.e. 58% ) show a detectable depolarisation ( oudmaijer & drew 1999 , vink et al .",
    "we conclude that , given both the statistics , as well as the smooth and broad depolarization behaviour in the herbig be h@xmath0  data , that _ all _ early herbig be stars are likely embedded in electron scattering discs .",
    "when observing the later spectral type herbig ae stars , one may expect to see a sharp decrease in the frequency of line effect detections , as the circumstellar ionization as well as the amount of free electrons that can scatter and polarize , are expected to drop among later type stars .",
    "another reason to expect a decrease in the frequency of line effects going from herbig be to the later ae stars is that there appears to be a general absence of h@xmath0  polarization changes in the even later type pms t tauri stars ( bastien 1982 ; but see sect .",
    "[ s_rytau ] ) .    however , this turns out not to be the case at all .",
    "the number of line effects in herbig ae stars is found to be particularly high : 9 out of 11 herbig ae stars show a significant line effect ( vink et al .",
    "xy  per is included here as an example , as represented in figs .",
    "1(b ) and  2(b ) : not only is there a line effect , it is noticeably different from the depolarization behaviour seen in the herbig be stars .",
    "first , the drop in the % pol is not as broad as it is for the herbig be stars .",
    "second , the behaviour in pa is not smooth . instead , a line - center flip of the pa is clearly noticeable in the upper panel of the triplot in fig .",
    "this pa rotation translates into a `` loop '' in the equivalent @xmath8 diagram of fig .",
    "the interpretation of these @xmath8 loops in herbig ae stars is still a matter of ongoing investigation , but in the next section ( sect .",
    "[ s_model ] ) , we show that photons arising from a compact source of hot spots ( a natural consequence of the magnetospheric accretion model ) on the stellar surface that are subsequently scattered in a rotating circumstellar disc may explain the observed h@xmath0  spectropolarimetry data of herbig ae ( and possibly t  tauri stars ; see sect .",
    "[ s_rytau ] ) .",
    "we employ a 3d monte carlo scattering model torus ( harries 2000 ) to simulate a compact source of photons arising from two diametrically opposed accretion hot spots onto a circumstellar disc .",
    "the disc has an inner hole of 3 stellar radii , and is assumed to be flat . as the h@xmath0  emission is compact in this model , we may expect intrinsic _ line _ polarization to occur .",
    "figures  3(a ) and  3(b ) represent the two extreme cases for an almost edge - on ( lhs ) and an almost pole - on ( rhs ) disc respectively . as expected for an edge - on disc",
    ", there is a significant level of continuum polarization of a few percent . due to the asymmetry in the velocity field , one hot spot  positioned at an angle of 65@xmath11  from the equator  illuminates the redshifted part of the disc that is rotating away from us , while the other ( diametrically opposed ) hot spot illuminates the blueshifted part of the disc moving towards us .",
    "both spots illuminate the disc at similar angles , so that no significant pa changes occur across the line .    for the more pole - on case ,",
    "the first difference is the lower level of continuum % pol , as the scattering is now more spherically symmetric ( positive and negative @xmath12 and @xmath13 cancel , resulting into a drop in the net polarization ) .",
    "as far as the line polarization is concerned , the asymmetry in the velocity field is now diminished , and this results in an effective merging of the double - peaked % pol profile into one single peak . finally , because the illumination of the pole - on disc no longer occurs under similar angles ,",
    "there is a rotation in the pa in the upper panel of fig .",
    "3(b ) , which is indeed the same type of behaviour that is commonly observed in h@xmath0  spectropolarimetry of herbig ae stars ( see fig .",
    "partly because of a general absence of polarization changes across h@xmath0  using narrow band filters in t  tauri stars ( e.g. bastien 1982 ) , the commonly accepted view of the origin of t  tauri polarization is that it is due to scattering off extended dusty envelopes .",
    "however , in figure 4(a ) we show the first spectropolarimetric measurements of an object classified as a t  tauri star , and we notice similar complexity across h@xmath0  for ry  tau as seen in herbig ae stars .",
    "most notable is the rotation in the pa , which translates into a loop when plotted in @xmath8 space ( fig .",
    "this change in the polarization percentage and the pa across h@xmath0  suggests that line photons are scattered in a rotating disc .",
    "we are able to derive the value of the pa from the slope of the loop in the @xmath9 diagram and find it to be 146 @xmath14 3@xmath11 .",
    "this is close to perpendicular with respect to the pa of the disc of 48 @xmath14 5@xmath11  as deduced from submillimeter imaging by koerner & sargent ( 1995 ) .",
    "these findings are consistent , as the pa of the imaged millimeter disc is expected to lie at 90@xmath11  to the scattering pa deduced from the polarization data .",
    "we finally note that if these medium / high resolution ( @xmath6 @xmath4 8000 ) data were averaged  as in the narrow h@xmath0  filter observations of bastien ( 1982) they would most likely have produced a null result .",
    "h@xmath0  spectropolarimetry has been shown to be a powerful tool in studying the circumstellar geometry around low and intermediate mass pms stars . for the herbig",
    "ae / be stars we found that 16 out of 23 show a line effect , which immediately implies that flattening is common among intermediate mass pms stars .",
    "furthermore , we noticed a clear difference in h@xmath0  spectropolarimetry behaviour between the herbig be and ae groups .",
    "for the herbig be stars , the concept of an electron scattering disc has been shown to be able to explain the depolarizations . at lower masses ,",
    "more complex h@xmath0  polarimetry behaviour starts to appear .",
    "the concept of a compact source of near - stellar h@xmath0  emission , for instance associated with magnetospheric accretion , has been proposed to qualitatively explain the linear polarization changes across h@xmath0  seen in herbig ae and ry  tau .",
    "the striking resemblance in spectropolarimetric behaviour between these pms stars may suggest a common origin for the polarized line photons , and hint that low and higher mass pre - main sequence stars may have rather more in common than had hitherto been suspected .",
