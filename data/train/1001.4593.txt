    "we present a proof of this result using the minimal amount of technology , both from the point of view of homological algebra and holomorphic curves . assuming that the work @xcite of mau , wehrheim , and woodward on holomorphic quilts extends to the wrapped setting ( a reasonable , though by no means obvious assumption )",
    ", one can alternatively prove first that the wrapped fukaya category , under the assumptions of theorem [ thm : main_thm ] , is _ homologically smooth _ in the sense of kontsevich ( see , e.g. section 8.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "namely , the theory of holomorphic quilts defines a functor from the fukaya category of the product @xmath8 to the category of bimodules over the fukaya category of @xmath0 ; the image of the geometric diagonal under this functor is the diagonal bimodule . with the help of appendix [ sec : univ - twist - compl ]",
    ", one can conclude from the assumptions of theorem [ thm : main_thm ] that the geometric diagonal lies in the category split - generated by products of objects of @xmath7 .",
    "from that , the existence of a functor is sufficient to conclude that the diagonal bimodule over @xmath1 is a _ perfect bimodule _ ; i.e. that it lies in the category split - generated by tensor products of left and right yoneda modules ( see appendix [ sec : univ - twist - compl ] for details about these modules ) .",
    "in fact , the construction shows that only objects lying in @xmath7 are required to produce the complex exhibiting the diagonal as a perfect bimodule . from this one",
    "concludes that the objects of @xmath7 split - generate @xmath1 by a generalisation of beilinson s argument @xcite to the case where morphism spaces are allowed to have infinite rank ( the existence of such a generalisation seems known to experts , though it does not appear in the literature in the desired form ) .    combining theorem [ thm : main_thm ] with recent work of bourgeois , ekholm and eliahsberg announced in @xcite",
    "should imply that the unstable manifolds of a plurisubharmonic morse function on a stein manifold split - generate its wrapped fukaya category , though there are still technical gaps in relating their symplectic field theory approach with the floer equations we use .",
    "in the special case of cotangent bundles , the interested reader can find some applications developed in the papers @xcite . in a different direction ,",
    "the exactness assumption can be dropped , and we expect upcoming joint work with fukaya , oh , ohta , and ono to address the case of compact ( weakly unobstructed ) lagrangians .",
    "for compact unobstructed lagrangians , one may construct a map analogous to equation whose target is ordinary cohomology as explained in section 13 of @xcite ( see also conjecture 1 and 2 in @xcite for a discussion from a more abstract topological field theory point of view ) .",
    "however , because of the lack of poincar duality in wrapped floer homology , one can not directly import intuition from topological field theory .",
    "we bypass these difficulties by stating theorem [ thm : main_thm ] in the concrete manner given , rather than trying to appeal to a more theoretical approach .",
    "to prove the generation criterion , we consider , for any object @xmath9 in @xmath1 , the left and right @xmath1 modules @xmath10 and @xmath11 given by the yoneda construction . passing to cohomology ,",
    "these are the modules which respectively assign to a lagrangian @xmath12 the wrapped floer cohomology groups @xmath13 which are morphism spaces in @xmath1 . using the same notation for the restriction of these modules to @xmath7",
    ", we define a map @xmath14 of @xmath7 bimodules in section [ sec : coproduct - as - map ] ; here @xmath7 stands for the diagonal bimodule .",
    "again , at the level of cohomology , @xmath15 consists of a collection of maps @xmath16 for every pair @xmath17 of objects of @xmath7 satisfying appropriate conditions with respect to multiplication by morphism spaces in @xmath7 .",
    "note that composition in the fukaya category defines a natural map in the other direction .",
    "one should think of @xmath15 as a `` pre - dual '' for multiplication ; an honest dual can not be expected since morphism spaces may be of infinite rank .",
    "one may define hochschild homology groups with coefficients in any bimodule in such a way that a map of bimodules induces a map on hochschild homology .",
    "in the special case where the bimodule is a tensor product @xmath18 of a left and a right module , we have @xmath19    applying this general nonsense to our geometric situation , we conclude that @xmath15 induces a map @xmath20 on the other hand , composition in @xmath7 defines a map @xmath21 in section [ sec : maps - relating - open ] , we shall construct maps @xmath22 and @xmath23 by counting solutions to a floer - type equation on a disc with @xmath24 interior puncture and appropriate boundary conditions , and we shall prove the next result in section [ sec : cardy - relation ] :    [ prop : cardy_relation ] up to an overall sign of @xmath25 , the following diagram commutes : @xmath26^{hh_{*}(\\delta ) }   \\ar[d]^{h^{*}({\\mathcal { oc } } ) } &   h^{*}({\\mathcal y}^{r}_{k } \\otimes_{{\\mathcal b } } { \\mathcal y}^{l}_{k } ) \\ar[d]^{h^*(\\mu ) } \\\\",

    "for example , if we consider an element in hochschild homology represented by a endomorphism of @xmath12 then the composition of @xmath23 and @xmath22 corresponds to the first broken curve in figure [ fig : cardy ] , while we interpret the other composition as the second pair of broken curves . in this simplest situation ,",
    "the moduli spaces we use have been recently studied by biran - cornea and fukaya respectively in the case of monotone and unobstructed compact lagrangians . by gluing the interior nodes or the pair of boundary nodes , one obtains an annulus with one boundary circle mapping to @xmath12 and the other to @xmath9 , and the commutativity of diagram follows from generalising the fact that we may interpolate between these",
    "two broken curves through the moduli space of annuli .",
    "[ fig : cardy ]   +     we state a final algebraic lemma proved in appendix [ sec : univ - twist - compl ] before establishing the main theorem :    [ lem : existence_twisted_complex ] if the identity of @xmath27 lies in the image of @xmath28 , then @xmath11 is a summand of a twisted complex built from objects of @xmath7 .",
    "the statement that @xmath7 split - generates @xmath1 is equivalent to the existence , for each object @xmath9 of @xmath1 , of a twisted complex built from objects of @xmath7 that admits @xmath9 as a summand .",
    "the previous lemma therefore reduces the proof of split - generation to the verification that the identity of each object lies in the image of @xmath28 .",
    "the identity in symplectic cohomology is represented by a count of rigid holomorphic planes .",
    "on the other hand , the image of an element of symplectic cohomology under @xmath29 is obtained by counting rigid discs with one interior puncture converging to a representative of this element , and boundary conditions along @xmath9 .",
    "the result of gluing a rigid plane to the interior puncture can be deformed by a standard argument ( see , e.g. section 4.2 of @xcite ) to a rigid disc with boundary on @xmath9 ; this count precisely represents the identity of @xmath9 in its wrapped floer cohomology group .    under the hypothesis of theorem [ thm : main_thm ]",
    ", the commutativity of diagram therefore implies that the identity in @xmath27 lies in the image of @xmath28 which completes the proof .",
    "i am grateful to kenji fukaya for showing me his proof that every unobstructed lagrangian in @xmath30 must intersect the clifford torus , for the discussions we had in which we proved that the clifford torus split - generates the fukaya category , and for pointing out that a preliminary version of this paper omitted a necessary sign in lemma [ lem : second_homotopy_sign ] .",
    "i would also like to thank paul seidel for explaining to me that a quotient @xmath31 of differential graded categories vanishes if and only if every object of @xmath32 is equivalent to a summand of a cone on objects of @xmath7 .",
