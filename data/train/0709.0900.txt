    "besides the many existing radioactive beam facilities and their upgrades , many more are being constructed or under planning , including the cooling storage ring ( csr ) facility at hirfl in china @xcite , the radioactive ion beam ( rib ) factory at riken in japan @xcite , the fair / gsi in germany @xcite , spiral2/ganil in france @xcite , and the facility for rare isotope beams ( frib ) in the usa @xcite .",
    "these new facilities offer the possibility to study the properties of nuclear matter or nuclei under the extreme condition of large isospin asymmetry . as a result ,",
    "the study of the isospin degree of freedom in nuclear physics has recently attracted much attention .",
    "the ultimate goal of such study is to extract information on the isospin dependence of in - medium nuclear effective interactions as well as the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , particularly its isospin - dependent term or the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "this knowledge , especially the latter , is important for understanding not only the structure of radioactive nuclei , the reaction dynamics induced by rare isotopes , and the liquid - gas phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter , but also many critical issues in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , especially its behavior at high densities , is largely unknown and is regarded as the most uncertain among all the properties of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter . although the nuclear symmetry energy at normal nuclear matter density @xmath1 @xmath2 is known to be around @xmath3 mev from the empirical liquid - drop mass formula @xcite , its values at other densities are poorly known @xcite .",
    "various microscopic and phenomenological models , such as the relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) @xcite and the non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) @xcite approach , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model based on nucleon - meson interactions @xcite , and the non - relativistic mean - field model based on skyrme - like interactions @xcite , have been used to study the isospin - dependent properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , such as the nuclear symmetry energy , the nuclear symmetry potential , the isospin - splitting of nucleon effective mass , etc . , but the predicted results vary widely .",
    "in fact , even the sign of the symmetry energy above @xmath4 is uncertain @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the isospin dependence of in - medium nuclear effective interactions and the limitations in the techniques for solving the nuclear many - body problem . as to the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter , it is essentially undetermined @xcite , even after about 30 years of studies . for comparison , the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter at its saturation density",
    "@xmath5 has been determined to be @xmath6 mev from the nuclear gmr @xcite and the eos at densities of @xmath7 has also been constrained by measurements of collective flows in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .    as a phenomenological approach ,",
    "the rmf model has achieved great success during the last decade in describing many nuclear phenomena @xcite .",
    "for example , it provides a novel saturation mechanism for the nuclear matter , an explanation of the strong spin - orbit interaction in finite nuclei , a natural energy dependence of the nucleon optical potential , etc .",
    "the rmf approach is generally based on effective interaction lagrangians that involve nucleon and meson fields . in this approach",
    ", a number of parameters are adjusted to fit the properties of many nuclei . as such",
    ", these models usually give excellent descriptions of nuclear properties around or below the saturation density .",
    "since the original lagrangian proposed by walecka more than @xmath3 years ago @xcite , there have been a lot of different treatments , extensions , and applications of the rmf model .",
    "the three main versions are the nonlinear models @xcite , models with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings @xcite , and point - coupling models without mesons @xcite . for each version of the rmf model ,",
    "there are also many different parameter sets with their values fitted to the binding energies and charge radii of a large number of nuclei in the periodic table .",
    "including isovector mesons in the effective interaction lagrangians further allows the rmf model to describe successfully the properties of nuclei far from the @xmath8-stability line . with recent developments in constraining the isospin - dependent properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy ,",
    "it is of great interest to see to what extend the results from different versions of the rmf model are consistent with these constrains .    in the present work , based on",
    "commonly used @xmath0 different parameter sets in three different versions of the rmf model , we carry out a systematic study of the isospin - dependent bulk and single - particle properties of asymmetric nuclear matter . in particular , we study the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy from these rmf models and compare the results with the constraints recently extracted from analyses of the isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion collisions based on the isospin and momentum - dependent ibuu04 transport model with in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross sections @xcite , the isoscaling analyses of isotope ratios in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions @xcite , and measured isotopic dependence of the giant monopole resonances ( gmr ) in even - a sn isotopes @xcite . among these @xmath0",
    "commonly used interactions in nuclear structure studies , only a few are found to give symmetry energies that are consistent with the empirically extracted one .",
    "furthermore , we study the nuclear symmetry potential and the isospin - splitting of the nucleon effective mass in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "our results indicate that the nuclear symmetry potential at fixed baryon density may increase or decrease with increasing nucleon momentum depending on the definition of the nucleon optical potential and the interactions used .",
    "this dependence is also seen in the isospin - splitting of the nucleon effective mass in neutron - rich nuclear matter .",
    "in addition , the isospin - splitting of the nucleon scalar density in neutron - rich nuclear matter is also studied .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ isospin ]",
    ", we discuss some isospin - dependent bulk and single - particle properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , such as the nuclear symmetry energy , the nuclear symmetry potential , and the isospin - splitting of nucleon effective mass as well as current experimental and/or empirical constraints on these quantities .",
    "the theoretical frameworks for the different versions of rmf models , i.e. , the nonlinear rmf models , the models with density - dependent nucleon - meson coupling , and the nonlinear and density - dependent point - coupling models , are briefly reviewed in section [ rmf ] .",
    "results on the isospin - dependent properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , i.e. , the nuclear symmetry energy , the nuclear symmetry potential , and the isospin - splitting of nucleon effective mass and the nucleon scalar densities in neutron - rich nuclear matter , from different versions of rmf models are presented and discussed in section [ results ] . a summary",
    "is then given in section [ summary ] .",
    "for completeness , the isospin- and momentum - dependent mdi interaction , which will be used as a reference in some cases for comparison , is briefly described in appendix [ mdi ] .",
    "the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , given by its binding energy per nucleon , can be generally written as @xmath9where @xmath10 is the baryon density with @xmath11 and @xmath12 denoting the neutron and proton densities , respectively ; @xmath13 is the isospin asymmetry ; @xmath14 is the binding energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter , and @xmath15 is the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the absence of odd - order terms in @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ esympara ] ) is due to the exchange symmetry between protons and neutrons in nuclear matter when one neglects the coulomb interaction and assumes the charge symmetry of nuclear forces .",
    "the higher - order terms in @xmath17 are negligible , e.g. , the magnitude of the @xmath18 term at @xmath19 is estimated to be less than @xmath20 mev @xcite . neglecting the contribution from higher - order terms in eq .",
    "( [ esympara ] ) leads to the well - known empirical parabolic law for the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter , which has been verified by all many - body theories to date , at least for densities up to moderate values . as a good approximation",
    ", the density - dependent symmetry energy @xmath21 can be extracted from @xmath22 , i.e. , the energy change per nucleon when all protons in the symmetric nuclear matter are converted to neutrons while keeping the total nuclear density fixed . in this sense",
    ", the nuclear symmetry energy gives an estimation of the binding energy difference between the pure neutron matter without protons and the symmetric nuclear matter with equal numbers of protons and neutrons .",
    "it should be mentioned that the possible presence of the higher - order terms in @xmath23 at supra - normal densities can significantly modify the proton fraction in @xmath24-equilibrium neutron - star matter and the critical density for the direct urca process which can lead to faster cooling of neutron stars @xcite .    around the nuclear matter saturation density @xmath19 , the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath21  can be expanded to second - order in density as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the slope and curvature parameters of the nuclear symmetry energy at @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath28 the @xmath26 and @xmath27 characterize the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy around normal nuclear matter density , and thus carry important information on the properties of nuclear symmetry energy at both high and low densities .",
    "in particular , the slope parameter @xmath26 has been found to correlate linearly with the neutron - skin thickness of heavy nuclei and thus can in principle be determined from measured thickness of the neutron skin of such nuclei @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , because of the large uncertainties in the experimental measurements , this has not yet been possible so far .    at the nuclear matter saturation density and around @xmath29 , the isobaric incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter can also be expressed to second - order in @xmath16 as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter at the nuclear matter saturation density and the isospin - dependent part @xcite @xmath32characterizes the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "information on @xmath33 can in principle be extracted experimentally by measuring the gmr in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "earlier attempts based on this method have given , however , widely different values .",
    "for example , a value of @xmath34 mev with a large uncertainty was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from a systematic study of the gmr in the isotopic chains of sn and sm . in this analysis",
    ", the value of @xmath31 was found to be @xmath35 mev , which is somewhat larger than the commonly accepted value of @xmath36 mev . in a later study ,",
    "an even less stringent constraint of @xmath37 mev was extracted from the gmr of finite nuclei , depending on the mass region of nuclei and the number of parameters used in parameterizing the incompressibility of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "most recently , a much stringent constraint of @xmath38 mev has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from measurements of the isotopic dependence of the gmr in even - a sn isotopes .    besides studies of nuclear structure , heavy - ion reactions , especially those induced by radioactive beams , also provide a useful means to investigate in terrestrial laboratories the isospin - dependent properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , particularly the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "indeed , significant progress has recently been made both experimentally and theoretically in extracting the information on the behaviors of nuclear symmetry energy at sub - saturation density from the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions from the nscl / msu @xcite . using the isospin and momentum - dependent ibuu04 transport model with in - medium nn cross sections ,",
    "the isospin diffusion data were found to be consistent with a density - dependent symmetry energy of @xmath39 with @xmath40 at subnormal density @xcite , which has led to the extraction of a value of @xmath41 mev for the slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density and a value of @xmath42 mev for the isospin - dependent part of the isobaric incompressibility of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this has further imposed stringent constraints on both the parameters in the isospin - dependent nuclear effective interactions and the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei . among the @xmath43 sets of skyrme interactions commonly used in nuclear structure studies ,",
    "only the @xmath44 sets siv , sv , g@xmath45 , and r@xmath45 have been found to give symmetry energies that are consistent with above extracted one .",
    "using these skyrme interactions , the neutron - skin thickness of heavy nuclei calculated within the hartree - fock approach is consistent with available experimental data @xcite and also that from a relativistic mean - field model based on an accurately calibrated parameter set that reproduces the gmr in @xmath46zr and @xmath47pb as well as the isovector giant dipole resonance of @xmath47pb @xcite .",
    "the extracted symmetry energy further agrees with the symmetry energy @xmath48 recently obtained from the isoscaling analyses of isotope ratios in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions @xcite , which gives @xmath49 mev and @xmath50 mev .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath42 mev from the isospin diffusion data is also consistent with the value @xmath38 mev obtained from recently measured isotopic dependence of the gmr in even - a sn isotopes @xcite .",
    "we note that the gmr only allows us to extract the value of @xmath33 but not that of @xmath26 .",
    "these empirically extracted values for @xmath26 and @xmath51 represent the best and most stringent phenomenological constraints available so far on the nuclear symmetry energy at sub - normal densities .",
    "although the behavior of the symmetry energy at high densities is presently largely undetermined , much of this information is expected to be obtained from future high energy radioactive beam facilities .",
    "the nuclear symmetry potential refers to the isovector part of the nucleon mean - field potential in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter . besides the nuclear density",
    ", the symmetry potential of a nucleon in nuclear matter also depends on the momentum or energy of the nucleon .",
    "the nuclear symmetry potential is different from the nuclear symmetry energy as the latter involves the integration of the isospin - dependent mean - field potential of a nucleon over its momentum .",
    "the nuclear symmetry potential is thus a dynamical quantity while the nuclear symmetry energy is a thermodynamic quantity , and both are important for understanding many physics questions in nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "various microscopic and phenomenological models have been used to study the symmetry potential @xcite , and the predicted results vary widely as in the case of the nuclear symmetry energy . in particular , whereas most models predict a decreasing symmetry potential with increasing nucleon momentum albeit at different rates , a few nuclear effective interactions used in some models give an opposite behavior .",
    "there are different methods to derive the real part of the non - relativistic optical potential based on the dirac equation with lorentz covariant nucleon vector and scalar self - energies .",
    "the most popular one is the so - called schrdinger - equivalent potential \" ( sep ) . from the nucleon scalar self - energy @xmath57 and the time - like component of the vector self - energy @xmath58",
    ", the schrdinger - equivalent potential  is given by @xcite : @xmath59+\\frac{\\sigma _ { \\tau } ^{0 } } { m_{\\tau } } e_{\\tau }   \\notag \\\\ & = & \\sigma _ { \\tau } ^{s}+\\sigma _ { \\tau } ^{0}+\\frac{1}{2m_{\\tau } } [ ( \\sigma _ { \\tau } ^{s})^{2}-(\\sigma _ { \\tau } ^{0})^{2 } ] + \\frac{\\sigma _ { \\tau } ^{0}}{m_{\\tau } } e_{\\mathrm{kin}},\\notag\\\\ \\label{usep}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath60 is the kinetic energy of a nucleon , i.e. , @xmath61 with @xmath62 being its total energy .",
    "eq.([usep ] ) shows that @xmath63 increases linearly with the nucleon energy @xmath62 or kinetic energy @xmath60 if the nucleon self - energies are independent of energy .",
    "we note that by construction solving the schrdinger equation with above sep gives same bound - state energy eigenvalues and elastic phase shifts as the solution of the upper component of the dirac spinor in the dirac equation with same nucleon scalar self - energy and time - like component of the vector self - energy @xcite .",
    "the above sep thus best represents the real part of the nucleon optical potential in non - relativistic models @xcite .",
    "the corresponding nuclear symmetry potential is given by @xmath64 with @xmath16 being the isospin asymmetry .",
    "another popular alternative for deriving the non - relativistic nucleon optical potential in relativistic models is to take it as the difference between the total energy @xmath62 of a nucleon with momentum @xmath65 in the nuclear medium and its energy at the same momentum in free space @xcite , i.e. , @xmath66 in obtaining the last step in above equation , the dispersion relation @xmath67has been used .",
    "this definition for the nucleon optical potential has also been extensively used in microscopic dbhf calculations @xcite and transport models for heavy - ion collisions @xcite . for energy - independent nucleon self - energies ,",
    "@xmath68 approaches a constant value of @xmath69 when @xmath70 , unlike the linear increase of @xmath63 with the nucleon energy . for @xmath71",
    ", we have @xmath72 while @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , @xmath68 displays a more reasonable high energy behavior than @xmath63 .",
    "we note that unlike @xmath63 , @xmath68 does not give the same bound - state energy eigenvalues and elastic phase shifts as the solution of the upper component of the dirac equation . as in the case of @xmath63 , the symmetry potential in this approach",
    "is defined by @xmath74    in ref .",
    "@xcite , another optical potential was introduced based on the second - order dirac ( sod ) equation , and it corresponds to multiplying eq.([usep ] ) by the factor @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath76+\\frac{\\sigma _",

    ", we have @xmath79 $ ] . the symmetry potential based on the optical potential of eq .",
    "( [ usd ] ) is given by @xmath80    above discussions thus show that the optical potentials defined in eqs .",
    "( [ uopt ] ) and ( [ usd ] ) have similar high energy behaviors , but they may be very different from that defined in eq .",
    "( [ usep ] ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which has been shown to be generally valid in the rmf model even at higher baryon densities , we have , however , @xmath83 at low momenta ( @xmath84 ) , indicating that above three definitions for the optical potential in the rmf model behave similarly at low energies . however , it should be stressed that , among the three optical potentials defined above , only @xmath63 is obtained from a well - defined theoretical procedure and is schrdinger - equivalent while @xmath68 and @xmath85 are used here for heuristic reasons as they are of practical interest in microscopic dbhf calculations , transport models for heavy - ion collisions , and dirac phenomenology .",
    "empirically , a systematic analysis of a large number of nucleon - nucleus scattering experiments and ( p , n ) charge - exchange reactions at beam energies up to about @xmath86 mev has shown that the data can be very well described by the parametrization @xmath87 with @xmath88 mev and @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "although the uncertainties in both parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 are large , the nuclear symmetry potential at nuclear matter saturation density , i.e. , the lane potential @xmath92 @xcite , clearly decreases approximately linearly with increasing beam energy @xmath60 .",
    "this provides a stringent constraint on the low energy behavior of the nuclear symmetry potential at saturation density .",
    "as we will see in the following , although the predicted energy dependence of nuclear symmetry potential at low energy from the rmf models does not agree with the empirical lane potential , it is consistent with results from microscopic dbhf @xcite , the extended bhf with 3-body forces @xcite , and chiral perturbation theory calculations @xcite , which give a lane potential that also stays as a constant or increases slightly with momentum for nucleons with momenta less than about @xmath93 mev / c or with kinetic energies @xmath94 but decreases with momentum when the momentum is larger than about @xmath93 mev / c .",
    "recently , the high energy behavior of the nuclear symmetry potential has been studied in the relativistic impulse ( @xmath95-@xmath96 ) approximation based on the empirical nn scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the nuclear symmetry potential derived from the schrdinger - equivalent potential at a fixed density becomes almost constant when the nucleon kinetic energy is greater than about @xmath97 mev , independent of the parameters used in the analysis .",
    "it is further shown that for such high energy nucleons the nuclear symmetry potential is slightly negative at baryon densities below about @xmath98 @xmath2 and then increases almost linearly to positive values at high densities .",
    "these results provide important constraints on the high energy behavior of the nuclear symmetry potential in asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore , with the love - franey nn scattering amplitude developed by murdock and horowitz @xcite , the intermediate - energy ( @xmath99 @xmath100 mev ) behavior of the nuclear symmetry potential constructed from the schrdinger - equivalent potential in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter has also been investigated recently @xcite .",
    "it shows that the nuclear symmetry potential at fixed baryon density decreases with increasing nucleon energy .",
    "in particular , the nuclear symmetry potential at saturation density changes from positive to negative values at nucleon kinetic energy of about @xmath101 mev .",
    "such an energy and density dependence of the nuclear symmetry potential is consistent with those from the isospin- and momentum - dependent mdi interaction with @xmath102 ( see appendix [ mdi ] for details on this interaction ) .",
    "these results thus provide an important consistency check for the energy / momentum dependence of the nuclear symmetry potential in asymmetric nuclear matter , particularly the mdi interaction with @xmath102 . on the other other ,",
    "the low energy behavior of the nuclear symmetry potential at densities away from normal nuclear density is presently not known empirically .",
    "experimental determination of both the density and momentum dependence of the nuclear symmetry potential is thus of great interest , and heavy - ion reactions with radioactive beams provides a unique tool to extract this information in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "many different definitions for the nucleon effective mass can be found in the literature @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we mainly focus on the following three effective masses : the dirac mass @xmath103 ( also denoted as @xmath104 in the present work ) , the landau mass @xmath105 , and the lorentz mass @xmath106 .",
    "the dirac mass @xmath103 is defined through the nucleon scalar self - energy in the dirac equation , i.e. , @xmath107 it is directly related to the spin - orbit potential in finite nuclei and is thus a genuine relativistic quantity without non - relativistic correspondence .",
    "we note that the difference between the nucleon vector and scalar self - energies determines the spin - orbit potential , whereas their sum defines the effective single - nucleon potential and is constrained by the nuclear matter binding energy at saturation density . from the energy spacings between spin - orbit partner states in finite nuclei ,",
    "the constraint @xmath108 @xmath109 has been obtained on the value of the dirac mass @xcite .",
    "the landau mass @xmath105 is defined as @xmath110 in terms of the single - particle density of state @xmath111 at energy @xmath62 and thus characterizes the momentum dependence of the single - particle potential . in the relativistic model ,",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath112 since @xmath113 is in principle measurable , the landau mass from the relativistic model should have a comparable value as that in the non - relativistic model .",
    "empirically , based on non - relativistic effective interactions such as the skyrme - type interactions , calculations of the ground - state properties and the excitation energies of quadrupole giant resonances have shown that a realistic choice for the nucleon landau mass is @xmath114 = @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "the smaller landau mass than that of nucleon free mass would lead to a smaller level density at the fermi energy and much spreaded single - particle levels in finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "the lorentz mass @xmath116 characterizes the energy dependence of the schrdinger - equivalent potential @xmath63 in the relativistic model and is defined as @xcite @xmath117 it has been argued in ref . @xcite",
    "that it is the lorentz mass @xmath116 that should be compared with the usual non - relativistic nucleon effective mass extracted from analyses carried out in the framework of non - relativistic optical and shell models .",
    "it can be easily seen that in the non - relativistic approximation ( @xmath118 ) , the lorentz mass @xmath116 reduces to the landau mass @xmath119 .    in relativistic models , the nucleon effective mass has sometimes also been introduced via the energy dependence of the optical potential in eq .",

    "although results for different parameter sets are almost the same at lower baryon densities , they become different when @xmath342 @xmath2 , and this is consistent with the conclusions of refs .",
    "in particular , different parameter sets in the nonlinear rmf model predict a larger uncertainty for the value of the nucleon scalar density at high baryon density while all the parameter sets ( except pc - la ) in the density - dependent rmf model and point - coupling models give roughly same results for the nucleon scalar density .",
    "these features are consistent with the results for the density dependence of nucleon dirac mass shown in figs .",

    "using different versions of relativistic mean - field models that are commonly used in current nuclear structure studies , i.e. , the nonlinear model , the model with density - dependent nucleon - meson coupling , and the point - coupling model , we have investigated systematically the isospin - dependent bulk and single - particle properties of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter . in particular , we considered @xmath0 parameter sets commonly and successfully used in nuclear structure studies , i.e. , nl1 , nl2 , nl3 , nl - sh , tm1 , pk1 , fsu - gold , ha , nl@xmath136 , nl@xmath261 for the nonlinear rmf model ; tw99 , dd - me1 , dd - me2 , pkdd , dd , dd - f , and ddrh - corr for the density - dependent rmf model ; and pc - f1 , pc - f2 , pc - f3 , pc - f4 , pc - la , and fkvw for the point - coupling rmf model .",
    "most of the parameter sets are obtained from fitting the binding energies and charge radii of a large number of nuclei in the periodic table or the results from the microscopic dbhf approach , which have been shown to describe successfully a number of the properties of finite nuclei .    using these models ,",
    "we have studied the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy and compared the results with the symmetry energy recently extracted from the analyses of the isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion collisions based on an isospin- and momentum - dependent transport model with in - medium nn cross sections , the isoscaling analyses of isotope ratios in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions , and measured isotopic dependence of the giant monopole resonances in even - a sn isotopes .",
    "these analyses have led to the extraction of @xmath41 mev for the slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density and @xmath346 mev or @xmath347 mev for the isospin - dependent part of the isobaric incompressibility of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , which may represent the most stringent phenomenological constraints available so far on the nuclear symmetry energy at sub - saturation densities . using these constraints ,",
    "we have found that , among the @xmath0 parameter sets considered in the present work , only six sets , i.e. , tm1 , nl@xmath136 , nl@xmath261 , pkdd , pc - la , and fkvw , have nuclear symmetry energies that are consistent with the extracted @xmath26 value of @xmath348 mev while fifteen sets , i.e. , nl3 , nl - sh , tm1 , pk1 , ha , nl@xmath136 , nl@xmath261 , tw99 , pkdd , dd - f , pc - f1 , pc - f2 , pc - f3 , pc - f4 , and fkvw , have nuclear symmetry energies that are consistent with the extracted @xmath33 value of @xmath349 mev or @xmath347 mev .",
    "furthermore , we have found surprisingly that only five parameter sets , i.e. , tm1 , nl@xmath136 , nl@xmath261 , pkdd , and fkvw , in the @xmath0 parameter sets have nuclear symmetry energies that are consistent with the extracted values for both @xmath26 and @xmath33 .",
    "we have noted that most parameter sets in the nonlinear and point - coupling rmf models predict stiffer symmetry energies while those in the density - dependent rmf model give softer symmetry energies .",
    "these features are probably related to the rather limited flexibility in the parametrization of the isovector channel in all rmf models and also the fact that most of the parameter sets are obtained from fitting properties of finite nuclei which are mostly near the @xmath8-stability line and thus have less constraint on the isospin - dependent properties of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "moreover , we have focused here on the behavior of the symmetry energy around saturation density while the parameter sets in rmf models are fitted to the properties of finite nuclei that are more sensitive to the properties of the nuclear symmetry energy at sub - saturation densities .",
    "we have also investigated the energy dependence of three different nucleon optical potentials , i.e. , the schr dinger - equivalent potential@xmath350 ( eq . ( [ usep ] ) ) , the optical potential from the difference between the total energy of a nucleon in nuclear medium and its energy at the same momentum in free space @xmath351 ( eq . ( [ uopt ] ) ) , and the optical potential based on the second - order dirac equation @xmath352 ( eq . ( [ usd ] ) ) , as well as their corresponding symmetry potentials @xmath353 , @xmath354 , and @xmath355 as functions of momentum .",
    "the results indicate that different optical potentials in symmetric nuclear matter exhibit similar energy dependence at low energies but have different high energy behaviors . in particular , at high energies , @xmath350 continues to increase linearly with momentum while @xmath351 and @xmath352 seem to saturate and thus display a more satisfactory high - energy limit compared to the optical potentials extracted from proton - nucleus scatterings using the dirac phenomenology . on the other hand , the nuclear symmetry potential at a fixed baryon density can increase or decrease with increasing nucleon momentum depending on the definition for the nucleon optical potential and the interactions used . for @xmath356 at @xmath357 @xmath2 ,",
    "results from all @xmath0 parameter sets show that it increases with momentum , which is consistent with the predictions of microscopic dbhf and chiral perturbation calculations at low momenta ( less than about 300 mev / c ) but is inconsistent with the experimental result that the nuclear symmetry potential at saturation density ( the lane potential @xmath92 ) decreases at low energies ( beam energy @xmath60 above @xmath264 mev and less than about @xmath86 mev and corresponding momentum values are from about @xmath358 mev / c to @xmath359 mev / c ) and ria predictions at higher energies . for @xmath354 and @xmath360 , they can , however , decrease with momentum for some parameter sets , which is qualitatively consistent with the experimental constraint .",
    "again , we emphasize that , for the three definitions of the optical potential and thus their corresponding nuclear symmetry potentials , only @xmath63 is well - defined theoretically and is schrdinger - equivalent while @xmath68 and @xmath85 are used here for references as @xmath68 has been extensively used in microscopic dbhf calculations @xcite and transport models for heavy - ion collisions @xcite and @xmath85 has been used in analyses of the relativistic optical potential based on the dirac phenomenology @xcite .",
    "we have further explored different nucleon effective masses , i.e. , @xmath103 , @xmath105 , @xmath361 , @xmath362 , and @xmath363 in symmetric nuclear matter as well as their isospin - splittings in neutron - rich nuclear matter .",
    "most of the parameter sets are found to give reasonable values for @xmath103 as required by the spin - orbit splitting data in finite nuclei but too small values for @xmath364 , implying that they would give too small a level density at the fermi energy and too large a spread of the single - particle levels in finite nuclei . for @xmath116 , it is found to display the strongest ( almost linear ) density dependence even at high densities .",
    "interestingly , including the isovector - scalar channel leads to the isospin - splitting of @xmath103 , and @xmath365 is always obtained in neutron - rich nuclear matter for the nonlinear and density - dependent rmf models but an opposite result can be observed in the point - coupling model . for @xmath105 ,",
    "most parameter sets give the isospin splitting @xmath366 in neutron - rich nuclear matter , which is consistent with usual results in non - relativistic models , while an opposite isospin - splitting is observed for @xmath116 .",
    "in addition , @xmath362 , and @xmath367 are found to display similar behaviors as @xmath368 .",
    "finally , we have studied the baryon density dependence of the nucleon scalar density and its isospin - splitting in neutron - rich nuclear matter .",
    "the results indicate that the neutron scalar density is larger than that of proton in neutron - rich nuclear matter at a fixed baryon density . at low baryon densities ,",
    "the neutron and proton scalar densities generally approach their respective baryon densities in asymmetric nuclear matter .    in the present work ,",
    "we have focused on three versions of standard rmf models , i.e. , the nonlinear , density - dependent , and point - coupling rmf models .",
    "we note that there are some recent works @xcite in which the standard rmf models are extended to include density - dependent hadron masses and meson coupling constants via the brown - rho ( br ) scaling @xcite .",
    "in particular , the parameter sets slc and slcd constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite are not only consistent with current experimental results for symmetric matter at normal and supra - normal densities and the symmetry energy constrained by the isospin diffusion data at sub - saturation densities , but also give a fairly satisfactory description of the ground state properties of finite nuclei , including binding energies , charge radii , and neutron skin thickness .    in all standard rmf models ,",
    "the nucleon self - energies are independent of momentum / energy . as a result",
    ", the dirac mass and the landau mass obtained from these models can not be simultaneously consistent with experimental data ( see , e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ mlandir ] ) ) . also , the schrdinger - equivalent potential@xmath350 ( eq . ( [ usep ] ) ) in these models increases linearly with nucleon energy even at high energies .",
    "recently , momentum - dependent nucleon self - energies have been introduced in the rmf model by including in the lagrangian density the couplings of meson fields to the derivatives of nucleon densities @xcite , and the results indicate that a reasonable energy dependence of the schrdinger - equivalent potential  in symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density can be obtained , and the landau mass can also be increased to a more reasonable value while keeping the dirac mass unchanged , which further leads to an improved description of @xmath8-decay half - lives of neutron - rich nuclei in the @xmath369 and @xmath370 regions @xcite . in the framework of density - functional theory , including the couplings of meson fields to the derivatives of nucleon densities in the lagrangian density provides an effective way to take into account higher - order effects .",
    "another way to introduce the momentum - dependence in nucleon self - energies is to include the fock exchange terms by means of the relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) approximation , even though in practice the inclusion of the fock terms would increase significantly the numerical complexity such that it is very difficult to find appropriate effective lagrangians for the rhf model to give satisfactory quantitative description of the nuclear structure properties compared with standard rmf models @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been some developments in the density - dependent rhf approach @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the density - dependent rhf model can describe the properties of both finite nuclei and nuclear matter with results comparable to those from standard rmf models . a more phenomenological way to improve the results of rmf models",
    "is to introduce momentum- as well as isospin - dependent form factors in the meson - nucleon coupling constants .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the empirically observed energy dependence of the nuclear optical potential in symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density can be reproduced by relativistic mean - field models with momentum - dependent form factors . finally , to better understand the isospin - dependent properties of asymmetric nuclear matter it is crucial to investigate the density and momentum dependence of underlying isovector nuclear effective interaction . to reach this ultimate goal , we need not only more advanced theoretical approaches but also more experimental data both on finite nuclei , especially those far from @xmath371-stability line , and from heavy - ion reactions induced by high energy neutron - rich nuclei .",
