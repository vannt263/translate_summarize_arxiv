    "concrete examples of such relationships include the kawai - lewellen - tye  @xcite relations which connect amplitudes in closed and open string theories . in the low - energy limit",
    "this gives a very puzzling and non - trivial map between perturbative amplitudes in gravity and yang - mills theory that is far from obvious when viewed at the field theory perspective  @xcite .    in this letter",

    "different color orderings of external legs are connected to specific integration regimes on the string world sheet , but they can be related to each other through monodromy relations . in the field theory limit",
    "the phase relations between different integrals induced by these monodromy considerations reduce to a set of equations linking gauge theory amplitudes with different color traces .",
    "we first remark that by cyclicity of the trace the number of color ordered amplitudes is reduced from @xmath2 to @xmath3 the full set of monodromy relations for the color - ordered amplitudes imply a drastic reduction of the number of independent amplitudes in the @xmath0-point case .",

    "@xcite for the extension to gauge theory with matter ) and already checked explicitly to a high number of external legs with different combinations of external states and helicities .",
    "the origin of this reduction in basis amplitudes appears in a particularly transparent manner from string theory .",
    "we will here briefly recall how to derive these monodromy - induced relations for string theory amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath0-point amplitude in open string theory with @xmath4 gauge group reads @xmath5 - 6ptwhere @xmath6 is any number of dimensions obtained by dimensional reduction from @xmath7 dimensions if we consider the bosonic string , or @xmath8 dimensions in the supersymmetric case .",
    "in fact our considerations are completely general and without reference to any specific string theory .",
    "the color - ordered amplitudes on the disc are given by  @xcite @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the bosonic case and @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the supersymmetric case .",
    "the ordering of the external legs is enforced by the product of heaviside functions such that @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "the mbius @xmath17 invariance requires one to fix the position of three points denoted @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "a traditional choice is @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , supplemented by the condition @xmath24 in the superstring case .",
    "all helicity dependence of the external states is contained in the @xmath25 factor . for tachyons",
    ", one has @xmath26 while for @xmath0 gauge bosons with polarization vectors @xmath27 one arrives at @xmath28 for the bosonic string and at @xmath29 for the superstring case where @xmath30 are anticommuting variables .",
    "in order to understand the relations that monodromy imposes we will begin with a discussion of the relations that arise at four points  @xcite . in that case , we can expand the amplitude @xmath31 plus permutations .    for simplicity ,",
    "we phrase the discussion in terms of tachyon amplitudes . with the choice @xmath21 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , all three different color - ordered amplitudes @xmath34",
    "are given by the same integrand @xmath35 but with @xmath36 integrated over different domains : @xmath37 - 6pt by a relabeling of indices , we can derive all the four - point relations shown below from just the first of these integrals .",
    "however , the present form is more useful for exploiting the monodromy relations  @xcite satisfied by the @xmath0-point amplitudes .",
    "we first consider @xmath38 , where we can indicate the contour integration from 1 to @xmath39 by +     _ contour of integration for the amplitude @xmath40._,width=328 ]    assuming that the @xmath41 are complex with negative real parts , we can deform the integration region so that instead of integrating between from 1 to @xmath39 on the real line we integrate either on a contour slightly above or below the real axis . by deforming each of the contours",
    ", one can convert the expression into an integration from @xmath42 to 1 . when rotating the contours one needs to include the appropriate phases each time @xmath43 passes through @xmath44 or @xmath45 , @xmath46 the deformation of the integration region can thus be done by rotating in the upper half plane +    .",
    "[ fig2]_,width=328 ]    because the original amplitude is real , the real part of this contour integral expresses the original amplitude @xmath47 where the minus sign arises from the reversed orientation of the contour .",
    "the imaginary part vanishes : @xmath48 this system of equations implies that all amplitudes can be related to @xmath40 : @xmath49 where we have used momentum conservation and the on - shell condition , @xmath50 . for other external states of higher spin with the inclusion of the appropriate @xmath25 factor , the integrals change in order to restore the identities ( including sign factors for the fermionic statistics of half - integer spins ) .",
    "these relations are valid for all four - point amplitudes in bosonic and supersymmetric string theory , as can immediately be checked using the explicit expressions for such string amplitudes .    taking the limit @xmath51 , we get the following relations between field theory amplitudes : @xmath52 these identities agree with those of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the general @xmath0-point case . by generalizing the four - point case",
    "we will prove that any color - ordered @xmath0-point amplitude can be expressed in terms of a minimal basis of @xmath1 amplitudes @xmath53 . in the field theory limit",
    "these relations reduce to the new amplitude relations conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , we show to how to reduce the number of independent amplitudes from @xmath3 to @xmath54 in this way we derive a string theory generalization of the so - called kleiss - kuijf relations in field theory  @xcite . indeed , in the limit @xmath55",
    ", our relations reduce to those , providing an immediate and alternative proof of them .",
    "our starting point will be the most general amplitude , given in term of an integral with three fixed points , one at @xmath56 : @xmath21 , one at @xmath57 : @xmath58 , and one at @xmath39 : @xmath59 .",
    "there can then be @xmath60 points @xmath61 in the interval @xmath62-\\infty,0[$ ] , @xmath63 points @xmath64 in the interval @xmath620,1[$ ] and @xmath65 points @xmath66 in the interval @xmath621,+\\infty[$ ] .",

    "( we use the notation @xmath62a , b]=\\{x | a < x\\leq b\\}$ ] . )",
    "we first focus on the integrations of the @xmath61 variables in the amplitude @xmath69 , illustrated in the figure below : +    .",

[ fig4]_,width=328 ]    we thus have an identity that relates the original integral with integrations in the domain @xmath62-\\infty,0[$ ] with a sum of integrations in the complementary region @xmath620,+\\infty[$ ] .    .",
    "[ fig5]_,width=328 ]    taking the real parts of this @xmath0-point equation we arrive at the following amplitude relation:@xmath71,\\vspace{-0.2cm}\\\\end{aligned}\\]]-6ptwith @xmath72 if @xmath73 and 1 otherwise , @xmath74 denotes the leg 1 at point 0 .",
    "the @xmath75 arises because the flip is reversing the @xmath60 integrations over the @xmath70-variables . in ( [ stringkk ] )",
    "the sum runs over the ordered set of permutations that preserves the order within each set .",
    "these new relations between string theory amplitudes are generalizations of the field theory kleiss - kuijf relations , @xmath76 - 10ptto which they reduce when @xmath55 since all phases become unity in that limit . the string theory relations ( [ stringkk ] ) reduce the set of independent amplitudes from @xmath3 to @xmath54 in detail by eliminating all amplitudes with legs in the integration interval @xmath62-\\infty,0[$ ] in favor of those with legs in the interval @xmath620,+\\infty[$ ] , with the two extreme ends fixed .",
    "however , we have not yet used all the information contained in these @xmath0-point monodromy relations .    because the amplitudes @xmath77 are real , the imaginary parts of the @xmath0-point relations give @xmath78.\\vspace{-0.3cm}\\ \\end{split}\\]]-10ptby systematically using these relations",
    ", we can connect all amplitudes which have points in the region @xmath621,+\\infty[$ ] with amplitudes which have points only in the region @xmath79 $ ] ( and one leg fixed at infinity ) .",
    "our proof is as follows .",
    "first we directly eliminate all amplitudes with points between @xmath62\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\infty,\\!0[$ ] in favor of amplitudes with legs in the interval @xmath620,+\\infty[$ ] , using ( [ stringkk ] ) .",
    "next using ( [ stringbern ] ) we can rewrite amplitudes of the kind @xmath80 in terms of amplitudes with at least one @xmath81 among the set @xmath82 and now with at most @xmath83 elements between @xmath621,+\\infty[$ ] .",
    "for each set @xmath84 we can find an identity in ( [ stringbern ] ) so that proceeding iteratively downward on the number of elements in @xmath84 starting with @xmath85 elements , we can thus express all amplitudes having points in the interval @xmath621,+\\infty[$ ] in terms of @xmath1 amplitudes restricted to the interval @xmath79 $ ] ( and one leg at infinity ) .",
    "explicitly , the five - point case gives    @xmath86    -15pt where we have introduced the notation @xmath87 .",
    "analogous equations are obtained by the exchange of labels @xmath88 .",
    "it is immediate to verify these relations from the explicit form of tree amplitudes in string theory amplitudes in string theory given in  @xcite . in the field theory limit",
    "they reduce to the relations discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we finally turn towards implications of these results for gravity amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath0-point closed string amplitudes can be represented as a left / right product of color - ordered open string amplitudes through the kawai - lewellen - tye relations  @xcite . using the result of the previous section",
    ", we can expand each open string amplitude of this sum in the basis of open string amplitudes @xmath89 : @xmath90 - 5pt the holomorphic factorization of the amplitude into left and right open string amplitudes introduces @xmath91 extra phase factors  @xcite of the type discussed above and the entries of the matrix @xmath92 are rational functions of degree @xmath91 in the quantities @xmath93 . since the matrix is symmetric this provides a left / right symmetric expression for the the gravity amplitudes in terms of the color ordered gauge theory amplitudes .    as a direct application of our procedure",
    ", we can rewrite the kawai - lewellen - tye relations at four - point level as @xmath94 - 7ptsimilarly , the five point closed string amplitude takes the symmetric form @xmath95 , \\label{kltfive } \\end{aligned}\\]]-9ptwhere    @xmath96    in the limit @xmath97 the @xmath98 are replaced by the scalar products @xmath99 .",
    "they lead to an expression for the field theory gravity amplitude that reproduces the results of  @xcite .",
    "it is now clear how this symmetric form can be proven for any number of external states .",
    "to conclude , we have derived a new series of amplitude identities based on monodromy for integrations in string theory , providing relations between different color - ordered amplitudes in either bosonic and supersymmetric string theory . as a first step ,",
    "we have derived the string theory generalization of kleiss - kuijf relations , thus providing a new and very simple proof of these relations also in the field theory limit .",
    "our main result is the proof that there is a minimal basis of only @xmath1 amplitudes in which all other amplitudes can be expanded .",
    "this follows from fixing three of the @xmath0 external legs at 0 , 1 and @xmath39 using the @xmath17 invariance of the amplitudes , and forcing the remaining @xmath91 coordinates to lie in the interval @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "because the monodromy relations hold for all polarization configurations and any smaller number of dimensions by a trivial dimensional reduction , it follows immediately that they hold for any choice of external legs corresponding to the full @xmath100 , @xmath101 supermultiplet and dimensional reductions thereof .",
    "the field theory limit of these relations generalize and prove for any number of external legs the new amplitude relations recently conjectured by bern et al .",
    "@xcite in gauge theory .",
    "the string theory monodromy identities for the kawai - lewellen - tye relationship between closed and open string amplitudes give highly symmetric forms for tree - level amplitudes between any external states in the @xmath102 , @xmath103 supermultiplet .",
