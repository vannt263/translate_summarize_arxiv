    "a stellar population of fixed mass fades as it ages .",
    "the predicted mass - to - light ratio @xmath0 of a galaxy therefore depends strongly on its age ( e.g. , bruzual & charlot 2003 ) and @xmath0 measurements can constrain galaxy formation times .",
    "the @xmath0 of a galaxy can not generally be accurately constrained from characteristics of the observed light ( e.g. , broad - band colors and line - strength indices ) alone .",
    "this is because low - mass stars contribute the bulk of the mass , but only a small fraction of the light .",
    "plausible variations in the assumed initial mass function ( imf ) can therefore change the @xmath0 without affecting significantly the characteristics of the observed light ( e.g. , bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "accurate measurements of galaxy @xmath0 values therefore generally rely on dynamical properties .",
    "the speed at which stars or gas move probes directly the gravitational force to which they are subjected , and therefore the mass of the system .",
    "the quality of the kinematical data for galaxies in the local universe , as well as the methods by which their dynamics can be modeled , have steadily increased in sophistication over the years .",
    "large samples of reliable @xmath0 measurements are now available from many studies , in particular for early - type galaxies ( e.g. , van der marel 1991 ; magorrian et al .  1998 ;",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ; cappellari et al .",
    "for these galaxies it is well established that the @xmath0 inside an effective radius is relatively constant , and contains only a small contribution from the dark halo ( e.g. , kronawitter et al .",
    "therefore , the inferred @xmath0 values are primarily driven by the characteristics of the stellar population .",
    "this situation differs considerably from the case for spiral galaxies .",
    "while mass profiles have been derived for many spiral galaxies ( e.g. , persic , salucci & stel 1996 ) , these profiles constrain primarily the properties of the dark halo .",
    "considerable uncertainty remains on the @xmath0 of the stellar population , or alternatively , on whether spiral galaxy disks are `` maximal '' or not ( e.g. , van albada et al .",
    "1985 ; courteau & rix 1999 ) .",
    "uncertainties in the imf for low - mass stars cause considerable uncertainty in the predicted @xmath0 at fixed age .",
    "so while accurate dynamical @xmath0 measurements are available for many early - type galaxies , these do not uniquely constrain the age of their stellar population .",
    "a more powerful constraint is provided by the _ relative _ rate at which the @xmath0 varies with time , or alternatively , redshift : @xmath9 / dz \\propto d \\log ( m / l ) / dz$ ] .",
    "because this is a relative measure , it depends less strongly on uncertainties in the imf for low - mass stars .",
    "of course , a dependence does remain on the exact shape of the imf for the higher - mass stars that produce most of the light .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath10 can be used to meaningfully constrain the formation redshift of early - type galaxies ( van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "studies of @xmath10 have so far relied primarily on measurements of the fundamental plane ( fp ) for galaxies in the nearby and distant universe ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) .",
    "the fp is a tight planar relation between the global properties of early - type galaxies in any three - dimensional parameter space spanned by quantities that measure the characteristic galaxy size , velocity dispersion , and surface brightness ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "for example , one might take the effective radius @xmath11 , the average velocity dispersion @xmath8 inside the effective radius , and the average surface brightness @xmath12 inside the effective radius .",
    "the existence of the fp can be understood as a combination of the virial theorem and a power - law dependence of @xmath0 on global galaxy properties ( dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; cappellari et al .",
    "a decrease in @xmath0 with redshift due to stellar population effects corresponds to an increase in @xmath12 , and consequently , a measurable decrease in the zeropoint of the fp .",
    "studies of fp evolution have provided important new insights into the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies ( see , e.g. , the following recent papers and references therein : wuyts et al .  2004 ; woo et al .",
    "2004 ; moran et al .",
    "2005 ; treu et al .",

    "; jorgensen et al .  2006 ) . in van dokkum &",
    "van der marel ( 2006 , hereafter vdvdm06 ) , we presented spectroscopy with the low resolution imager and spectrograph ( lris ) on keck of some two dozen galaxies in the intermediate - redshift ( @xmath6 ) clusters cl3c295 , cl0016 + 16 and cl1601 + 42 .",
    "the sample galaxies were selected to be bright enough for spectroscopy , and visually classified from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) images of dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) as early - type ( and in most cases elliptical ) galaxies .",
    "we measured the integrated velocity dispersions of the galaxies and analyzed existing hst images to infer their characteristic photometric properties .",
    "this allowed a study of the fp evolution of the three sample clusters .",
    "we combined our new results with existing fp data for eleven additional clusters in the redshift range @xmath13 as well as samples of field early - type galaxies in the redshift range @xmath14 .",
    "this provides the largest homogenized analysis of fp evolution to date and implies a luminosity - weighted mean star formation redshift @xmath15 for massive ( @xmath16 ) early - type galaxies in clusters .",
    "field early - type galaxies in the same mass range are only @xmath17% younger , with @xmath18 .",
    "( these results assume that the imf has a `` standard '' form and that the progenitor bias described by van dokkum & franx ( 2001 ) does not depend on environment ; see vdvdm06 for details ) .",
    "the success and popularity of fp studies can be attributed at least in part to the relative ease with which such studies can be performed .",
    "only global galaxy properties need to be measured , and modeling of the internal structure of the sample galaxies is not required . however , there are important caveats .",
    "in particular , values of @xmath10 determined from fp evolution are correct only if many simplifying assumptions are satisfied .",
    "any potential evolution of global galaxy properties other than @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath5 , @xmath11 and @xmath19 , the latter quantity being the average projected surface mass density inside @xmath11 ) must either be absent or be such so as to not affect the inferred @xmath0 evolution .",
    "also , galaxies must change homologously with redshift , if at all ; they must not evolve in quantities such as the shape of their three - dimensional contours , the shape of their density profile with radius , or the shape of their intrinsic dynamical structure .",
    "the possibility that evolution in any of these quantities may in fact occur has left the interpretation of fp studies somewhat uncertain .",
    "this possibility has come into sharp focus through the fact that the inferred @xmath0 evolution of massive early - type galaxies is well fit by models of passive evolution following formation at high redshift , and by the fact that there appears to be only a small age difference between massive early - type galaxies in clusters and the field ( vdvdm06 ) . although models can be constructed that reproduce these results ( e.g. , nagamine et al .",
    "2005 ; de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ) , they do appear somewhat counter - intuitive given the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation in the universe .",
    "moreover , there exist sophisticated semi - analytical models in which the evolution of galaxy @xmath0 and fp zeropoint are actually quite different ( almeida , baugh & lacey 2006 ) .",
    "so there are many reasons to critically question whether fp evolution does in fact uniquely trace @xmath0 evolution .",
    "the most direct way to address this question is to determine @xmath0 values for individual distant galaxies in the same way as has been done locally , without resorting to fp assumptions .",
    "this requires construction of detailed dynamical models for high - quality spatially resolved photometric and kinematic data . with these goals in mind we obtained spectroscopic data in vdvdm06 that was deep enough to extract spatially resolved rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles for the sample galaxies in cl3c295 , cl0016 + 16 and cl1601 + 42 . in van der marel & van dokkum ( 2006 , hereafter paper",
    "i ) we presented the kinematical profiles and constructed detailed dynamical models to interpret them .",
    "the models are axisymmetric and are based on solving the jeans equations of hydrostatic equilibrium under the assumption of a two - integral distribution function @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the energy and @xmath22 the angular momentum around the symmetry axis .",
    "fitting of the models to the available hst imaging and observed kinematical profiles yields two quantities : a normalized measure @xmath23 of the galaxy s rotation rate and the @xmath0 of the stellar population ( in rest - frame @xmath24 band solar units ) .",
    "the inferred values for these quantities and their formal uncertainties were presented in paper  i. the implications of the inferred rotation rates were also discussed in that paper . in the present paper",
    "we interpret the inferred @xmath0 values . to do this , we first compile and homogenize a comparison sample of galaxies in the local universe with reliable @xmath0 determinations from the literature .",
    "we then compare the @xmath0 values for the intermediate - redshift cluster galaxies to those for the local comparison sample to obtain a direct measure of the @xmath0 evolution of elliptical galaxies .",

    "to study the @xmath0 evolution with redshift we need a comparison sample of dynamically inferred @xmath0 values for _ nearby _ early - type galaxies .",
    "we restrict our attention here to five detailed dynamical modeling studies that addressed relatively large samples : van der marel ( 1991 , hereafter vdm91 ) ; magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter m98 ) ; kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter k00 ) ; gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter g03 ) ; and cappellari et al .",
    "( 2006a , hereafter c06 ) .",
    "these studies differ from each other in many ways , both in terms of the quality and nature of the data that were used , and in the methods and sophistication of the modeling . in particular :    * vdm91 and k00 used ground - based photometry , whereas m98 , g03 and c06 used a combination of both hst and ground - based photometry ; * vdm91 , m98 , k00 and c06 used ground - based spectroscopy , whereas g03 used a combination of ground - based and hst spectroscopy ; * vdm91 , m98 , k00 and g03 used long - slit spectroscopy along one or more slit position angles , whereas c06 used fully two - dimensional integral - field spectroscopy ; * k03 constructed spherical dynamical models ( they restricted their sample to galaxies that are almost circular in projection on the sky ) , whereas vdm91 , m98 , g03 and c06 constructed axisymmetric models ; * vdm91 and m98 constructed two - integral models using the jeans equations , k00 constructed models using an expansion around a set of known basis distribution functions , and g03 and c06 constructed fully general models using numerical orbit superposition ; * k00 included kinematical data in the central few arcsec in their fits , but did not allow for the possible gravitational contribution of a central bh ; vdm91 also did not include a bh in the models but excluded the central few arcsec from the fit ; c06 included a bh of fixed mass in the models but still excluded the central few arcsec from the fit ; and m98 and g03 included bhs in their models and fitted their masses by using the data in the central few arcsec ; * vdm91 , m98 , g03 and c06 assumed a constant value of @xmath0 with radius , whereas k03 explicitly included ( and optimized ) the contribution of a dark halo ; * k03 determined @xmath0 values in the @xmath24-band , m98 and g03 in the @xmath42-band , for one galaxy , ngc 4564 , in the @xmath43-band . ]",
    "vdm91 in the johnson @xmath44 band , and c06 in the @xmath43-band .",
    "we purposely included the results from all five studies , rather than to retain merely a smaller sample composed of the most recent or most accurate results .",
    "one advantage of this it that by comparing the results from the different studies we are able to put firm limits on various kinds of potential systematic uncertainties .",
    "it is important for our study to use a set of galaxy distances that is as accurate and homogeneous as possible .",
    "for this we follow the example of g03 and c06 by using the compilation of tonry et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter t01 ) .",
    "they obtained distances to 300 nearby galaxies , mostly of early type , using the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method .",
    "we removed from our initial sample of 81 total galaxies in vdm91 , m98 , k00 , g03 and c06 the 17 galaxies that are not part of the t01 sample .",
    "we rejected two more galaxies ( m31 and ngc 4594 ) because they are not early - type galaxies ( which we define here as hubble type @xmath45 ) and two other galaxies ( ngc 3384 and ngc 7332 ) for the reasons discussed in section  [ ss : dispersions ] .",
    "table  [ t : local ] lists the final sample of 60 galaxies and includes for each galaxy , among other things , the hubble type @xmath46 and the adopted distance modulus and its uncertainty .",
    "the average distance for the sample galaxies is @xmath47 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath48 , given the hubble constant listed in section  [ s : intro ] .",
    "there are 6 spiral galaxies with bulges in common between the sbf sample of t01 and the sample of galaxies for which cepheid distances are available from the hst cepheid key project .",
    "t01 calibrated the zeropoint of their sbf method so as to set to zero the _ median _",
    "sbf vs.  cepheid distance modulus residual for these 6 galaxies ( see appendix b of tonry et al .",
    "this was done using cepheid results available in 2000 .",
    "these cepheid distances have since been improved ( freedman et al .",
    "application of the same calibration methodology to the new cepheid distances implies an sbf zeropoint that is larger by @xmath49 mag ( e.g. , mei et al .",
    "2005 ) . to account for this",
    ", we added a correction @xmath50 mag to all the distance moduli in t01 ( i.e. , moving the galaxies closer ) .",
    "for the purposes of our study it is important to understand the accuracy with which the sbf and cepheid distance scales have been aligned . if one uses the weighted average rather than the median statistic to align the 6 spiral galaxies , then the sbf zeropoint changes by @xmath51 . alternatively , if one chooses not to align the distance scales using individual galaxies at all , but instead using distances to groups of galaxies ( ferrarese et al .",
    "2000 ) , then this yields a change of @xmath52 to the sbf zeropoint ( tonry et al .  2000 ) . and",
    "finally , if one changes the sbf zeropoint by @xmath53 , then better agreement is obtained with predictions of population synthesis models ( jensen et al .",
    "values of nearby galaxies . ] based on these considerations we assume that the systematic uncertainty on @xmath54 is @xmath55 mag .",
    "this corresponds to an uncertainty @xmath56 in @xmath41 .",
    "after its calibration to agree with cepheids , the sbf distance scale is subject to all the same absolute distance scale uncertainties that are inherent to the cepheid distance scale .",
    "these are summarized in section  8 and table  14 of freedman et al .",
    "most of the uncertainties affect both the distances of local galaxies , as well as the inferred value of @xmath31 .",
    "they include : the distance to the lmc , the photometric zeropoint of the hst / wfpc2 used for the cepheid studies , the accuracy of the reddening and metallicity corrections applied to the cepheids , and biases introduced by crowding and the magnitude limit of the sample . when added in quadrature , as in freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , these effects introduce a 9% systematic uncertainty in the galaxy distances .",
    "this corresponds to a difference @xmath57 in @xmath41 .",
    "this uncertainty must be taken into account , e.g. , when comparing the @xmath0 values of local galaxies to the predictions of stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the systematic cepheid distance scale uncertainties listed in the previous paragraph do _ not _ affect a relative comparison of @xmath0 values of nearby and distant galaxies .",
    "any shift in the overall distance scale of the universe would affect both types of galaxies equally , and would therefore cancel out when evaluating a difference in @xmath41 .",
    "the only distance scale uncertainties that do affect such a comparison are those that impact the estimate of @xmath31 , but not the cepheid distances to local galaxies .",
    "these uncertainties have both a systematic and a random component .",
    "the systematic component is due to cosmic variance , i.e. , the effect that local samples of galaxies may yield an estimate of @xmath31 that differs from the true cosmic value as a result of bulk flows .",
    "based on the discussion in section  8.6 of freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we estimate this systematic component to be less than 2% on the scales @xmath32 over which type ia supernovae have been used to calibrate @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to a difference @xmath58 in @xmath41 .",
    "random uncertainties in @xmath31 , as opposed to systematic ones , result from finite sample sizes and scatter between results from individual measurements .",
    "based on section  7 of freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we estimate the random uncertainty to be @xmath59 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath60 in @xmath41 .",

    "therefore , the trend in figure  [ f : dynfp ] must have a different origin .",

    "fp and dynamical modeling analyses rely in different manner on knowledge of the galaxy surface brightness profile . to calculate the fp position of a galaxy one needs to know only the integrated luminosity within the effective radius .",

    "the hypothesis of errors due to limited spatial resolution could at best explain the trend in figure  [ f : rot ] .",
    "galaxies with more rotational support tend to have lower mass ( see paper  i ) , therefore tend to be smaller on average , and therefore could in principle be more affected by spatial resolution issues .",
    "many studies in the past decade have addressed the @xmath0 evolution of early - type galaxies using the fp .",

    "it is therefore important to address @xmath0 evolution more directly by using dynamical models for spatially resolved photometric and kinematic data . in paper",
    "i we constructed two - integral @xmath385 models for 25 visually - classified early type ( and in most cases elliptical ) galaxies in the intermediate - redshift ( @xmath39 ) clusters cl3c295 , cl0016 + 16 and cl1601 + 42 .",
    "fitting of the models to surface photometry from hst and kinematics from keck / lris yielded for each galaxy the average rest - frame @xmath24-band @xmath0 inside the spectroscopically explored region .",

    "we investigated other potential explanations as well , including the possibility that our results may be biased due to unaccounted local dependencies of @xmath0 on environment , or the possibility that systematic errors may affect our results for the smallest galaxies due to the finite spatial resolution of the hst imaging data .",

    "in general , neither fp evolution nor evolution of the @xmath0@xmath231 relation can uniquely and correctly determine the amount of @xmath0 evolution , unless one knows ( or correctly assumes ) how the structural properties of the galaxies change with time .",
    "this is is not very well constrained observationally and one therefore has to rely on assumptions and theoretical insights .",
    "translation of @xmath0@xmath231 evolution into @xmath0 evolution assumes only that the @xmath8 of galaxies does not change over time .",
    "by contrast , translation of fp evolution into @xmath0 evolution assumes that none of the quantities @xmath5 , @xmath11 , @xmath393 , or the structure constant @xmath351 change over time .",
    "although elliptical galaxies are collisionless systems , all these structural quantities can in fact change through mergers .",
    "however , the inferred @xmath0 evolution is in practice used primarily to estimate the mean age of the stars under the assumption that only the luminosity is evolving ( e.g. , vdvdm06 ) .",
    "this relaxes the underlying assumptions in the sense that the correct age is obtained ( but not the correct @xmath0 evolution ) as long as any evolution of structural parameters moves galaxies only along the @xmath0@xmath231 relation or along the edge - on projection of the fp .",
    "models have suggested that structural changes induced by mergers do indeed approximately have this property ( gonzalez - garcia & van albada 2003 ; boylan - kolchin , ma , & quataert 2006 ; robertson et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "an approach that is based on dynamical models has less built - in assumptions than approaches ( such as those using the fp or @xmath394 values ) that are based entirely on global or characteristic quantities .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 values that we determined in paper  i account for several known non - homologies between galaxies , such as differences in axial ratio , brightness profile , rotational support , and internal velocity distribution .",
    "moreover , kinematical profiles as a function of radius were calculated and fitted , instead of just a single characteristic dispersion .",
    "we found that the difference in the @xmath0 evolution inferred from either dynamical models or the virial theorem correlates with the galaxy rotation rate @xmath23 .",
    "this suggests that the omission of rotation in studies of fp evolution may be an important oversimplification .",
    "nonetheless , it is important to stress that many caveats remain even with the dynamical modeling approach explored here .",
    "for example , if the triaxiality or velocity dispersion anisotropy of early - type galaxies evolves with redshift then this might bias the results of our dynamical models ( as it would for fp studies ) . also",
    ", both fp studies and the present work may suffer from `` progenitor bias '' .",
    "this is the bias introduced by the fact that some of today s early - type galaxies may not be identified as early - type galaxies in samples at higher redshifts ( see vdvdm06 for a discussion of the size of this bias ) .    in vdvdm06 we reported a steeping of the fp tilt with redshift for our sample galaxies .",
    "this is generally interpreted to mean that low - mass galaxies have undergone more @xmath0 evolution than high - mass galaxies , and are therefore younger .",
    "however , the results presented here show that this conclusion need not necessarily be correct : the dynamical models provide little evidence for a difference in @xmath0 evolution between low - mass and high - mass galaxies ; and the steepening of the fp tilt may be affected by other issues than @xmath0 evolution .",
    "this does not rule out the possibility that low - mass galaxies have younger population ages than high - mass galaxies .",
    "but it does mean than one should be careful in drawing conclusions of this nature entirely on the basis of fp data",
    ". in general it is important to test for differences in population age also on the basis of other considerations .",
    "for example , van der wel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and treu et al .",
    "( 2005b ) considered broad - band colors and spectroscopic diagnostics in combination with fp residuals to argue for age differences between field galaxies of different mass .",
    "their results are not necessarily inconsistent with those presented here , because the situation may be different for galaxies in the field and in clusters and it may be different at different redshifts .",
    "our work shows that dynamical modeling of large samples of galaxies at intermediate redshifts provides a powerful new method for the study of galaxy evolution .",
    "it therefore seems useful to expand the present work to other samples that explore a wider range of redshifts , environments , and galaxy types .",
