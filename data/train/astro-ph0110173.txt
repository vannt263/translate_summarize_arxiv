    "from the early 90 s , many models have been proposed to explain the behaviour of the sw sex stars . currently , the main point of discussion is whether the sw sex stars harbour magnetic white dwarfs or not .",
    "the idea of sw sex stars being magnetic cvs was strenghtened after the discovery of variable circular polarization in ls pegasi , modulated with a period of 29.6 min ( rodrguez - gil et al .",
    "the authors introduced a new accretion scenario , in which a disc - overflown gas stream meets the white dwarf s magnetosphere at the corotation radius , where a shock above the disc is produced .",
    "simultaneous @xmath1 polarimetry was performed in 1998 march 2 and 5 , with the turpol photopolarimeter at the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope , in la palma .",
    "the object was observed for a total of 5.3 hours ( 2.04 orbital periods ) .",
    "the zero polarization star bd + 33@xmath22642 was also measured .",
    "the mean circular polarization levels , after subtracting the averaged levels of the comparison star are : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this increasing trend with wavelength is reminiscent of cyclotron emission from accretion columns in intermediate polars ( see e.g. west , berriman , & schmidt 1987 ) .",
    "the same trend is observed in the intermediate polars , pq gem ( potter et al .",
    "1997 ) and bg cmi ( west et al .",
    "1987 ) .    in the periodogram from the @xmath0-band data ( see left panel of fig .  1 ) , two prominent peaks are located at @xmath8 min and @xmath9 min .",
    "we get a clear modulation when folding the @xmath0-band data on the latter period ( see right panel of fig .  1 ) , obtaining a peak - to - peak amplitude of 0.12  % .",
    "the modulation with this period is also evident in @xmath10-band and seems to vanish redwards .",
    "the 19.54-min period is consistent with the 19.3-min optical qpo reported by patterson & skillman ( 1994 ) .",
    "so , the 19.54-min period could be the spin period of a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "the polarization only takes positive values , a characteristic of low - inclination magnetic systems . following the method proposed by rodrguez - gil et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to estimate the primary magnetic field , we get a magnetosphere extending to @xmath11 r@xmath12 ( in ls peg , @xmath13 r@xmath12 ) and a field intensity of @xmath14 27 mg ."
