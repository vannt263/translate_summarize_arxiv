    "we presented a detailed experimental study of the superconducting properties of thin - film superconducting pb microbridges in the presence of a nonuniform magnetic field of the laminar domain structure in ferromagnetic bafe@xmath0o@xmath1 crystals .",
    "such ferromagnets generate rather strong stray fields and the parameters of this field ( amplitude and period ) are almost independent on the applied magnetic field @xmath5 in the considered @xmath5 range .",
    "we focused on the case when the domain walls are oriented perpendicular to the bridge in order to avoid electrical shunting and masking of less developed superconducting states by more favorable states during transport measurements . it was demonstrated that , at high temperatures superconductivity appears in the form of reverse - domain superconductivity only above magnetic domains of opposite polarity with respect to the @xmath5 sign .",
    "below the crossover temperature @xmath24 , defined as @xmath119 , superconductivity can nucleate both above antiparallel and parallel magnetic domains ( @xmath2 is the amplitude of the perpendicular component of the nonuniform field , is the temperature - dependent upper critical field ) .",
    "indeed , at @xmath78 the regions of inhomogeneous superconductivity above positive and negative domains overlap in the @xmath4 plane , resulting in so - called complete ( or global ) superconductivity and in the vanishing total electrical resistance of the hybrid sample .",
    "we also found experimental evidences for the regimes of edge - assisted reverse - domain superconductivity and edge - assisted parallel - domain superconductivity , corresponding to localized superconductivity near the edges of the bridge above the regions with compensated and enhanced magnetic field , respectively .",
    "we experimentally determined the critical currents , corresponding to the suppression of the localized superconductivity above parallel and antiparallel magnetic domains in a broad temperature range .",
    "the technique of low - temperature scanning laser microscopy made it possible to directly visualize the temperature and field - induced transitions from complete superconductivity to reverse - domain superconductivity and parallel - domain superconductivity and from these inhomogeneous superconducting states to the normal state .",
