    "solid solutions based on fega@xmath2 attracted much interest because of prospective thermoelectric applications and an intriguing low - temperature magnetic behavior .",
    "the parent binary compound fega@xmath2 is a rare representative of non - magnetic and semiconducting fe - based intermetallic compounds @xcite akin to the small gap semiconductors fesi@xcite and fesb@xmath15.@xcite because of the small value of the energy gap ( @xmath16 ) and narrow energy bands , these compounds are considered as potential thermoelectric materials demonstrating extremely high seebeck coefficient values of @xmath17  mv / k at 50  k and @xmath18  mv / k at 10  k for fesi@xcite and fesb@xmath15,@xcite respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath16 in fega@xmath2 was determined by various theoretical and experimental techniques , including _ ab initio _ band structure calculations ( @xmath19  ev),@xcite high - temperature magnetometry ( @xmath20  ev),@xcite photoelectron spectroscopy ( @xmath21  ev),@xcite and resistivity measurements ( @xmath22  ev).@xcite as discussed in ref .  , the dominant contribution to the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level in fega@xmath2 comes from the ga @xmath23 states and from predominantly non - bonding fe @xmath24 states at the top of the valence band .",
    "the band gap originates from a strong hybridization of the fe @xmath25 and ga @xmath26 atomic orbitals .",
    "the formation of the energy gap in fega@xmath2 is reminiscent of that in strongly correlated @xmath24 and @xmath27 kondo - insulators including fesi and fesb@xmath15 , which are likewise characterized by a small hybridization gap at the fermi level.@xcite    it has been reported@xcite that already a few percent cobalt doping in fega@xmath2 drastically changes the properties of the parent compound .",
    "namely , the 5% co - doped fe@xmath28co@xmath29ca@xmath2 exhibits properties of a bad metal and a curie - weiss paramagnet , in contrast to semiconducting and nonmagnetic fega@xmath2 .",
    "our _ ab initio _ band structure calculations have shown that the co doping shifts the fermi level position towards the conduction band formed by the @xmath24 ( fe / co ) and @xmath23 ( ga ) orbitals , thus leading to metallic properties and enabling precise tuning of the power factor pf = @xmath30 ( ref .  ) , where @xmath31 is the electrical conductivity . according to the resistivity data , the true metallic state for the fe@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 solid solution",
    "is achieved when @xmath32.@xcite the end member of the solid solution , coga@xmath2 , exhibits good metallic properties with residual resistivity ratio at the order of 100 and a temperature - independent paramagnetic susceptibility of conduction electrons , which is , however , outweighed by the core diamagnetic contribution.@xcite    remarkably , the ge doping on the ga site has an even more dramatic effect on the magnetism.@xcite the fega@xmath33ge@xmath34 solid solution reveals ferromagnetic ordering and an associated quantum critical behavior close to the critical concentration of @xmath35 , where the ferromagnetism emerges . in contrast , the fe@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 solid solution remains paramagnetic or nearly paramagnetic for all co concentration studied so far.@xcite    the fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath37 solid solution exists for any co concentration ( @xmath38 ) and demonstrates a noticeable deviation from the vegard behavior , even though the crystal structure and lattice symmetry remain the same for all co concentrations.@xcite this crystal structure should be considered as a three - dimensional framework constructed by polyhedra ( figure  [ s1]a ) .",
    "the main building unit is a pair of face - shared bicapped trigonal prisms centered by a t ",
    "t dumbbell , where t = fe , co ( figure  [ s1]b ) .",
    "the assembly of building units is arranged in compliance with the four - fold screw axis , which is parallel to the @xmath39 direction , such that face - shared filled prisms and empty spaces alternate in a staggered order .",
    "thus , the assembly of polyhedra constructs the entire , almost isotropic crystal structure . in support of this , the isostructural compounds fega@xmath2@xcite and ruin@xmath2@xcite show no significant anisotropy in their transport properties . on the other hand , electronic properties and their evolution upon doping",
    "may critically depend on the local structure , i.e. , whether the , fe  co , or co ",
    "co dumbbells are formed.@xcite while no ordering of the fe and co atoms was observed on the macroscopic level , the @xmath40ga nqr local probe revealed the primary formation of homo - atomic pairs fe  fe and co  co , although the fe  co dumbbells are also present in a significant amount.@xcite    in this paper , we report the results of the systematic study of the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic properties with co substitution for fe in the solid solution fe@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 , including electrical resistivity ( @xmath41 , 0.025 , 0.075 and 0.5 ) , magnetization ( @xmath42 ) , _ ab initio _ band structure calculations ( @xmath43 ) , and nuclear spin - lattice relaxation @xmath3 of the @xmath4ga nuclei .",
    "the electrical resistivity shows the anticipated metallic behavior at sufficiently high doping levels , namely , at and above @xmath44 .",
    "magnetization data for fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 are indicative of the localized magnetism with a relatively low effective moment",
    ". however , the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation @xmath3 of the @xmath4ga nuclei in the median compound fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 unexpectedly shows signatures of an itinerant antiferromagnetic behavior , with the @xmath3 strongly enhanced due to spin fluctuations .",
    "this scenario contrasts with the ferromagnetism observed in fega@xmath33ge@xmath34 and implied by _ ab initio _ band structure calculations for electron - doped fega@xmath2 .",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation of the binary coga@xmath37 compound which is a band metal free from fluctuating spins demonstrates the metallic - like korringa behavior with @xmath45 .",
    "in the parent semiconducting compound fega@xmath37 , the temperature dependence of the @xmath3 exhibits an unexpected huge maximum at low @xmath46  k indicating the existence of in - gap states placed near the fermi energy .",
    "these states seem to be responsible for the giant thermopower observed at the verge of magnetism in fe based semimetals fesb@xmath47,@xcite fe@xmath0m@xmath36si alloys ( m = co , ir , os ) @xcite and fega@xmath37.@xcite surprisingly , we found that the in - gap states in fega@xmath37 have a magnetic origin .",
    "just recently in - gap states earned an increased attention because the question arises if these metallic and magnetic states are located at the surface and therefore have a topological origin .",
    "smb@xmath48 can be considered as a prototype of a topological correlated semimetal.@xcite",
    "single - phase powder samples of the fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath37 solid solution for various @xmath38 were prepared by mixing the elements ( fe : powder , acros organics 99% ; co : powder , alfa aesar 99.8% ; ga : bar , aldrich 99.9999% ) with the fe : co : ga molar ratio of @xmath49 using ga both as a reactant and flux medium .",
    "mixtures of the elements were sealed in precarbonized quartz ampoules under vacuum ( less than 10@xmath50 torr ) and annealed in a programmable furnace at 900@xmath51c for 55 hours to obtain a homogeneous melt .",
    "after this a furnace was slowly cooled to 400@xmath51c in 125 hours and further to ambient temperature in 5 hours .",
    "excess ga was separated at 40@xmath51c using an eppendorf 5804r centrifuge , yielding needle - like silvery - gray crystals with a length up to several millimeters .",
    "the obtained crystals were purged from the remainder of ga with diluted 0.5 m hcl and washed consecutively with distilled water and acetone .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction study ( bruker d8 advance , cu - k@xmath52@xmath53 radiation , lynxeye detector ) confirmed phase purity of all prepared samples .",
    "electrical resistivity measurements were performed using a standard four - probe method with the dc setup of a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) in the temperature range @xmath54 k in zero magnetic field .",
    "electrical contacts ( cu 50 @xmath55 m wire ) were fixed on rectangular - shaped pellets with a typical size of @xmath56  mm@xmath57 using silver - containing epoxy resin ( epotek h20e ) hardened at 120@xmath51c .",
    "pellets were cold pressed from crystals ground in an agate mortar .",
    "densities of the obtained pellets were estimated from their linear sizes and masses to be in the range of 8992% from the theoretical ones .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples with a quantum design squid magnetometer mpms - xl .",
    "dc magnetic susceptibility was measured in an applied field of 0.1  t in the @xmath58  k temperature range .",
    "the magnetization was measured at 1.8  k with the magnetic field varying from 0 to 7  t.    the @xmath4ga nmr / nqr measurements were performed in the temperature range @xmath59  k utilizing a home - built phase coherent pulsed nmr / nqr spectrometer . the @xmath4ga nqr spectra were measured using a frequency step point - by - point spin - echo technique . at each frequency point , the area under the spin - echo magnitude was integrated in the time domain and averaged by a number of accumulations , which depends on the sample and temperature .",
    "nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rates were measured using the so - called `` saturation recovery '' method .",
    "nuclear magnetization recovery curves @xmath60 were obtained from the recovery of the spin - echo magnitude as a function of the time interval @xmath61 between the saturation pulse comb and the @xmath62 spin - echo sequence .",
    "given the discrepancies in the earlier literature,@xcite we performed a systematic study of the electrical resistivity of the fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath2 solid solution starting from @xmath41 ( figure  [ s2 ] ) .",
    "the samples with a small co content ( @xmath63 and 0.025 ) behave differently from those with @xmath64 . while at @xmath64 the solid solution exhibits metallic behavior , a significant increase in the resistivity upon cooling below 150  k",
    "is observed for @xmath63 and 0.025 .",
    "it is known from the literature@xcite that the resistivity of pure fega@xmath2 has different regimes in various temperature ranges . in comparison with fega@xmath2",
    ", the behavior of the solid solution for @xmath63 and 0.025 can be described as follows : for @xmath65  k the saturation of thermally activated impurity donors is observed , while for @xmath66  k the impurity donors are frozen out .",
    "such behavior suggests that the solid solution for @xmath63 and 0.025 should be regarded as a heavily - doped semiconductor .",
    "the transition from the semiconducting to metallic state occurs at @xmath67 .",
    "this result agrees with our previous observation that at @xmath32 the solid solution is already metallic.@xcite on the other hand , we do not confirm the results by umeo  _ et al._,@xcite who observed semiconductor - like behavior at @xmath68 .      the magnetic susceptibility for the fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath37 sample that was further studied with nqr ( see below ) was investigated .",
    "similar to ref .",
    ", we observed an overall paramagnetic behavior . above 100  k",
    ", the susceptibility follows the curie - weiss law : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the curie - weiss constant , @xmath71 is the curie - weiss temperature , and @xmath72 stands for a temperature - independent contribution including core diamagnetism , van vleck paramagnetism , and the contribution of itinerant electrons .",
    "we find @xmath73  emuk / mol , @xmath74  k , and @xmath75  emu / mol .",
    "the effective magnetic moment is @xmath76  @xmath14 according to @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "these fitting results are rather stable with respect to the fitting range .",
    "we always find a sizable and negative ( antiferromagnetic ) @xmath71 as well as the effective moment of @xmath79  @xmath14 , in good agreement with the earlier data by umeo _",
    "et al._,@xcite who also report the negative @xmath71 for a range of co concentrations .    despite the clear tendency of fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath37 toward an antiferromagnetic behavior ,",
    "the susceptibility of fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 shows a positive deviation from the curie - weiss law below 100k .",
    "however , we did not observe any signatures of ferromagnetism in this compound .",
    "the magnetization isotherm measured at 1.8k is nearly linear , with only a weak bending that can be tentatively approximated by the brillouin function augmented by an arbitrary linear term , which accounts for the increasing magnetization above the saturation of a spin-@xmath80 paramagnet : @xmath81 where we use @xmath82 , @xmath78 , @xmath83  k , and @xmath52 stands for the fraction of saturated paramagnetic moments .",
    "we find @xmath84 ( 3% out of 0.5 doped electrons / f.u . ) , indicating only a minor fraction of paramagnetic spins saturated in low fields . indeed",
    ", the @xmath71 of @xmath85  k implies sizable antiferromagnetic interactions that have to be overridden by the magnetic field before saturation is reached .",
    "fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath37 , and the fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath37 solid solution in general , are remarkably different from their fega@xmath33ge@xmath34 counterpart .",
    "the ge - based compounds are ferromagnetic , with a positive @xmath71 and the sizable remnant magnetization observed at low temperatures .",
    "the doping with co triggers an antiferromagnetic behavior , but does not induce any long - range magnetic order down to 2 k. in the following , we will substantiate these findings by analyzing the spin - lattice relaxation rate of the @xmath4ga nuclei .",
    "the fplo ( full potential local orbitals ) code was used for the electronic structure calculations.@xcite fplo performs density - functional ( dft ) calculations within the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation potential.@xcite the integrations in the @xmath86 space were performed by an improved tetrahedron method@xcite on a grid of @xmath87 @xmath86 points evenly spread in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the calculation of the spin - polarized state of the fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath2 solid solution was done in the following steps .",
    "firstly , an optimization of atomic coordinates was performed for different @xmath38 within the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) using the experimental values of lattice parameters.@xcite and secondly , self - consistent spin - polarized calculations were performed for the relaxed structure .",
    "in addition to the vca calculations , two types of ordering of the t atoms ( t = fe , co ) for @xmath88 were investigated .",
    "using the results of the crystal structure determination for @xmath42,@xcite we constructed two models , the first one with homonuclear fe  fe and dumbbells ( space group @xmath89 , @xmath90  a , @xmath91  a ) and the second one with heteronuclear fe  co dumbbells ( space group @xmath92 , @xmath93  a , @xmath94  a ) .",
    "spin - polarized states were calculated for these two models .",
    "we considered both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin configurations .",
    "however , only the ferromagnetic configuration could be stabilized .",
    "a variety of antiferromagnetic spin patterns constructed within the unit cell of fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath2 and within doubled unit cells all converged to a non - magnetic solution lying higher in energy than the ferromagnetic solution .",
    "therefore , dft calculations on the lda level put forward the ferromagnetic behavior of fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath2 .",
    "the variation of the total magnetic moment @xmath95 with @xmath38 , as obtained within the virtual crystal approximation , is illustrated in figure  [ s4 ] .",
    "it shows that the maximal magnetic moment is achieved for @xmath42 .",
    "a similar result was obtained by singh@xcite for the same number of injected electrons upon the substitution of ge for ga in fega@xmath33ge@xmath34 .",
    "indeed , on the vca level the electronic structure of doped fega@xmath2 evolves in a nearly rigid - band manner .",
    "therefore , no difference between the fe / co and ga / ge doping should be expected .",
    "the results of our calculations suggest that the half - metallic ferromagnetic state ( figure  [ s5 ] , left ) develops for @xmath96 .",
    "it turns to a metallic ferromagnetic state at @xmath97 and eventually becomes nonmagnetic at @xmath98 .",
    "this scenario is rather insensitive to the local order .",
    "the ordered supercells at @xmath88 also yield a ferromagnetic state with the local moment of 0.48  @xmath14 for the heteronuclear ( fe  co ) dumbbells and 0.41  @xmath14 for the homonuclear ( fe  fe , co ",
    "co ) dumbbells ( figure  [ s5 ] , right ) .    the ferromagnetic ground state is indeed observed in fega@xmath33ge@xmath99 .",
    "the experimental ordered moment of 0.27  @xmath14/f.u . at @xmath100 is somewhat lower than the calculated one ( @xmath101  @xmath102/f.u . at @xmath103 ) , as typical for itinerant magnets , where spin fluctuations , which are missing in lda , lead to a substantial reduction in the ordered moment . in the case of fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath2 ,",
    "the lack of magnetic ordering prevents us from a direct comparison of @xmath104 to the experiment .",
    "moreover , we find a qualitative difference between the ferromagnetic behavior , as predicted by lda , and the antiferromagnetic behavior , which is evidenced by the negative @xmath105 and additionally supported by the spin - lattice relaxation presented below .",
    "there are three nmr active and naturally abundant isotopes in fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath37 compounds suitable for nmr investigation : @xmath40ga , @xmath106ga , and @xmath107co .",
    "our previous @xmath4ga nqr investigations@xcite revealed high values of the quadrupole frequencies for both ga positions in the fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath2 solid solution series .",
    "two inequivalent positions of ga lead to very broad @xmath4ga nmr spectra with overlapping singularities of the powder pattern .",
    "thus , for the parent semiconductor compound fega@xmath2 exhibiting the strongest quadrupole splitting , we have measured only the central transition line of the field - sweep nmr spectrum of the @xmath106ga isotope , which has a lower quadrupole frequency ( fig .",
    "this spectrum is a textbook example of the nmr central transition powder pattern in the presence of quadrupole interactions in the second order of perturbation theory .",
    "it consists of two contributions : the characteristic double horn line with a step in the middle originating from the ga1 position with a low asymmetry parameter @xmath108 ( green line ) and the single peak with typical shoulders at the edges , which stems from the ga2 site with the high asymmetry parameter @xmath109 ( blue line ) .",
    "one can see that the observed @xmath106ga nmr spectrum coincides very well with our nqr results reported in ref .  .    with the co substitution for fe in fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath37 , the @xmath106ga",
    "nmr central transition line broadens and loses its sharp singularities , reflecting the increasing inhomogeneity of the electric field gradient ( efg ) distribution , in perfect agreement with the broadening of ga nqr lines .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ s7 ] , where the field - sweep spectrum of fe@xmath110co@xmath111ga@xmath2 is shown .",
    "interestingly , a strong line appears in the field range of @xmath112  t. this line can be assigned to a @xmath107co nmr signal with some broad background from the @xmath40ga isotope .    for the opposite side binary compound coga@xmath2 ,",
    "the nmr spectrum is completely dominated by an extremely narrow @xmath107co line observed very close to the larmor field position of the @xmath107co nuclei at 72.0  mhz ( fig .",
    "[ s7 ] ) . to measure such a narrow line properly",
    ", we had to reduce our spin echo pulse sequence to one pulse and use the fast fourier transform ( fft ) technique at a fixed magnetic field of 7.157 t .",
    "the fft @xmath107co spectra measured for coga@xmath2 at various temperatures are presented in the inset of fig .",
    "the striking narrowness of the @xmath107co nmr line shows that the co atom is in a completely nonmagnetic state , donating all 9 valence electrons to the conduction band , which results in good metallic properties of coga@xmath2.@xcite    the central transition line of the @xmath107co nmr spectra in coga@xmath2 exhibit relatively low 2-nd order quadrupole splitting of about 50 khz .",
    "the reason for this effect might be an effective dynamic screening of the lattice contribution to the electric field gradient ( efg ) by conduction electrons , while the on - site contribution to the efg is almost zero due to an absence of electrons localized on the valence @xmath24 and @xmath113 shells .",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate ( nslr ) @xmath3 was measured using the @xmath40ga nuclei for the ga1 nqr line ( see the bottom inset in fig .",
    "[ s8 ] ) in a wide temperature range of @xmath114  k for three fe@xmath0co@xmath36ga@xmath37 samples with the co concentrations @xmath115 , 0.5 , and 1.0 . for the edge binary compounds ,",
    "the magnetization recovery curves were single exponential , while for fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath37 the stretched exponent function provides better fitting results .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath9 in fega@xmath2 is presented in fig .",
    "surprisingly , it demonstrates a huge unexpected maximum at @xmath46  k with almost a one order of magnitude difference between the @xmath116 values at 6  k and at 50  k. this maximum unambiguously proves the existence of the in - gap states just below the conduction band .",
    "a very similar behavior was observed earlier for the @xmath117sb nslr in fesb@xmath15.@xcite the comparison of these nslr data for fega@xmath37 and fesb@xmath47 is presented in fig .",
    "[ s9 ] .    for a quantitative description of our @xmath9 data in fega@xmath2 we used the modified `` narrow band  small energy gap '' model.@xcite it contains two rectangular bands of width @xmath118 separated by a main gap of @xmath119 with a narrow peak of in - gap states of width @xmath120 with a density of states @xmath121 ) separated by the small gap of @xmath122 from the bottom of the conduction band ( see fig .",
    "[ s8 ] , top inset ) .",
    "there are two main temperature regimes in this model . in the low - temperature ( lt ) regime ,",
    "the nslr mechanism is caused by the activation of the localized in - gap electrons over a small gap @xmath122 into the empty conduction band .",
    "this leads to the gradual increase of ga 1/@xmath123 with increasing temperature from the lowest @xmath124k to the temperature of the nslr maximum around 6k .",
    "the narrow in - gap peak @xmath125 disappears at higher temperatures due to its broadening and overlap with the conduction band , resulting in the decreasing nslr and in the appearance of a clearly pronounced minimum on @xmath126 at 5060  k. then , in the high - temperature ( ht ) regime , @xmath116 starts increasing again due to the electron activation across the main energy gap @xmath119 .",

    "as clearly seen from this figure , in the low - temperature range from 2k to 40k the relaxation mechanism is exclusively magnetic . with further increase in temperature , the quadrupolar contribution to the total relaxation rate increases rapidly . finally , above 100k",
    "one arrives at the mixed case of both magnetic and quadrupole channels of nuclear relaxation with the pronounced domination of the latter .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the analysis described above .    due to its good metallic properties ,",
    "the opposite edge binary compound coga@xmath2 exhibits a korringa - like linear @xmath40ga spin - lattice relaxation caused by the contact interaction between the conduction electrons and @xmath40ga nuclei : @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the gyromagnetic ratios for electron and nucleus , @xmath168 is the contact hyperfine coupling between conduction electrons and nuclei , @xmath169 is the density of states at the fermi level , and @xmath170 is the korringa coefficient . as seen from figure  [ s11 ] ,",
    "the experimental @xmath171 data for coga@xmath2 can be perfectly approximated by eq .   in the entire investigated temperature range of 12300k with the best fit value of @xmath172 .",
    "a very fast relaxation rate is shown by the fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 compound : more than one order of magnitude faster than in coga@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ s11 ] ) . at first glance",
    ", it is quite natural since according to our band structure calculations@xcite the ratio of the squared densities of states at the fermi level for fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 and coga@xmath2 @xmath173(fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2)/@xmath173(coga@xmath2 ) = 7.26 .",
    "therefore , the linear korringa coefficient for fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 can be estimated as : @xmath174 the linear korringa function @xmath175 is plotted in fig .  [ s11 ] by the dashed line .",
    "it is indeed above the relaxation data for coga@xmath2 but still far below the experimental 1/@xmath141 data for the fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 compound .",
    "moreover , it has a wrong decline in the double logarithmic scale of fig .",
    "this result unambiguously shows that the spin - lattice relaxation in fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 is dominated by a mechanism other than the korringa mechanism .",
    "the model which describes our relaxation data in fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 is the moriya s spin - fluctuation theory.@xcite according to this theory for weak ( low @xmath176 ) or nearly antiferromagnetic ( af ) metals the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation is given by the equation : @xmath177 for @xmath178 , eq .",
    "is reduced to a square root temperature dependence @xmath13 , which is a unique feature of weakly and nearly af metals.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ s11 ] , our experimental @xmath3 data for fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 can be successfully fitted by a combination of the linear korringa term and spin - fluctuation contribution with dominance of the latter : @xmath179 this result is very similar to that observed by @xmath180mn nmr in @xmath181-mn , which is an af metal subject to a strong magnetic frustration ( @xmath182).@xcite the @xmath180mn relaxation in @xmath181-mn is mainly due to spin fluctuations , with a minor contribution from contact korringa interactions : @xmath3 = 1.7@xmath183 + 35.3@xmath184 .",
    "pure spin - fluctuation scenario of nuclear spin - lattice relaxation with @xmath13 in the wide temperature range of 2300k was observed by @xmath185la nmr in filled skutterudites la@xmath186fe@xmath187sb@xmath188.@xcite",
    "our experimental and computational study puts forward the complex magnetic behavior of the fe@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 solid solution . according to the nslr data , the median compound fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 reveals strong spin fluctuations that are characteristic of a weakly antiferromagnetic metal .",
    "this observation is consistent with the negative ( antiferromagnetic ) @xmath71 obtained in the curie - weiss fit of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "however , the @xmath189 ( curie - weiss ) behavior at high temperatures is generic for itinerant ferromagnets only.@xcite itinerant antiferromagnets will typically show a weak temperature dependence of @xmath190 above @xmath176.@xcite although itinerant electrons may accidentally mimic the curie - weiss - type behavior at high temperatures , it is more plausible to assume that the fe@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 solid solution combines features of the itinerant and localized antiferromagnets .",
    "in fact , both itinerant and localized magnetism can be envisaged for this system .",
    "metallic conductivity of the fe@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 solid solutions with @xmath64 implies the sizable concentration of itinerant electrons . on the other hand",
    ", the fe / co disorder on the transition - metal site may lead to at least partial localization , because the fe and co @xmath24 states provide dominant contribution at the fermi level.@xcite the latter mechanism is not operative in fega@xmath33ge@xmath34 , where the disorder is introduced on the ga site .",
    "indeed , the ge containing solid solutions are ferromagnetic , @xcite as predicted by lda .",
    "they do not show any signatures of the localized magnetism .",
    "their curie - weiss behavior at high temperatures can be well ascribed to the itinerant ferromagnetism .",
    "the ratio of the effective and ordered moments in the rhodes - wohlfarth plot follows the trend typical for itinerant ferromagnets ( see fig .  6 in ref .  ) .",
    "remarkably , the apparent antiferromagnetism of fe@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 is not matched by the lda results that predict the ferromagnetic nature of electron - doped fega@xmath2 irrespective of the doping mechanism . while band structure calculations do not fully account for the fe / co disorder",
    ", our results for the ordered supercells suggest that the ferromagnetic nature of fe@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 is quite robust within lda and only weakly depends on the local order of the fe and co atoms .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy between lda and the experiment can not be ascribed to a simple mixing of the fe and co atoms forming the , fe  co , and co  co dumbbells .",
    "it rather pertains to a more complex interplay of the itinerant and localized electrons that arise from this mixing .",
    "this conjecture is in line with the computational results by singh,@xcite who was able to stabilize an antiferromagnetic solution in pure fega@xmath2 , but only by adding the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath191 that creates local moments on fe .",
    "we have shown that in the parent compound fega@xmath2 the @xmath4ga spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath145 reveals an unexpected huge maximum at low temperatures with an essentially magnetic relaxation mechanism indicating the presence of an enhanced density of in - gap states placed near the fermi energy .",
    "these states frequently are assigned being responsible for the giant thermopower in fe based semimetals at low temperatures.@xcite only above @xmath192k , when the in - gap level is completely empty , the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation exhibits a crossover to a phonon mechanism characteristic of quadrupolar nuclei in nonmagnetic systems .",
    "the other end member , coga@xmath2 , is a band metal .",
    "it demonstrates the metallic korringa behavior of the spin - lattice relaxation with @xmath193 .",
    "the mixing of these well - understood fega@xmath2 and coga@xmath2 compounds triggers strong and unexpected antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "indeed , in the intermediate fe@xmath12co@xmath12ga@xmath2 compound @xmath145 is strongly ( by nearly two orders of magnitude ) enhanced due to spin fluctuations , with @xmath13 in perfect agreement with moriya s spin - fluctuation theory for itinerant magnetic systems .",
    "such a @xmath145 behavior is a unique feature of weakly and nearly af metals .",
    "the fe@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 compounds with @xmath38 close to 0.5 seem to be very close to magnetic ordering , which is prohibited probably by strong spin fluctuations and the structural disorder between the different t ",
    "t dumbbells , in contrast to the fega@xmath33ge@xmath34 system , which has a regular arrangement of solely homoatomic fe  fe dumbbells and exhibits a fm order at certain doping values .",
