    "we chose our spatial and temporal basis sets so as to decompose this problem into the iterated solution of @xmath75 sparse , banded linear systems for @xmath72 coefficients apiece , so that every timestep required computational effort on the order of @xmath76 .",
    "our spatial basis was constructed following @xcite to allow for infinite range exterior complex scaling .",

    "highly oscillatory functions can be treated by decreasing the size of the finite elements , or by increasing the order of the polynomials used inside each element .",
    "wavefunction continuity across element boundaries was enforced by constructing linear combinations of the primitive basis sets . within each element ,",
    "we constructed left border functions @xmath96 , right border functions @xmath97 , and interior functions @xmath98 for @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a local coordinate equal to @xmath101 at the left boundary and @xmath102 at the right boundary .",

    "wavefunction continuity was enforced by requiring the temporal coefficients @xmath107 of the left border function in one element to equal the coefficients of the right border function in the element to the left , and vice versa .",
    "border functions in the end caps were defined in an analogous way using laguerre rather than legendre polynomials .      while the spatial basis was constructed to yield sparse , banded spatial matrices and to enforce wavefunction continuity , the temporal basis set was constructed to reduce the size of the linear systems which must be solved at every timestep .",
    "linear combinations of the primitive legendre basis were constructed so that only one basis function was nonzero at the beginning of the timestep , while the other basis functions had a tridiagonal overlap structure . using local",
    "coordinate @xmath108 , equal to @xmath101 at the beginning of the timestep and @xmath109 at the end , we set @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the legendre polynomial of order n. note that @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "thus , the wavefunction at the beginning of the step is given by the coefficients of the zeroth order basis function , while the wavefunction at the end of the pulse is given by the sum of the coefficients of all the nonzero basis functions .",
    "the size of the linear systems to be solved can be reduced by performing an eigenvector decomposition of the residuals @xmath67 , @xmath117 , which must be eliminated by the tunneling wavefunction .",
    "( because @xmath118 are not free parameters , @xmath119 will not in general be canceled by the minimum action solution . ) noting that for small timesteps @xmath63 and @xmath120 are approximately constant , so that @xmath121 and @xmath122 , the residuals can be projected onto generalized eigenvectors of the @xmath123 and @xmath124 matrices . setting @xmath125 and @xmath126 for @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129",

    "however , as a single timestep will typically be very short compared to the frequency of the driving laser , the variation of @xmath63 and @xmath120 over a single timestep will be very small , and repeated application of this procedure will yield rapid convergence to zero residual .",
    "we repeat this iteration until @xmath140 has a norm less than some desired tolerance . after finding the minimum norm solution",
    ", we adjust the size of the next step so that the contribution of the last temporal basis function to the final wavefunction @xmath141 has a norm less than a chosen accuracy goal .",
    "having found the variationally optimum description of the wavefunction in the chosen basis , the timestep may now be adjusted to ensure that the wavefunction evolution is well described by the temporal basis .",
    "we ensure this by choosing a timestep such that the last legendre polynomial included in the primitive basis has a negligible contribution to the total solution .",
    "if @xmath142 is the vector of spatial coefficients for the last legendre polynomial and @xmath143 is its norm , then @xmath144 gives the ratio of the new time step to the old .",
    "these design choices yield a variable stepsize , variationally optimum propagator for a wavefunction described in a finite element basis .",
    "the order of the polynomials used to describe the wavefunction within each element , as well as the temporal order used to describe the wavefunction over a given timestep , can be chosen at will .",
    "the linear systems which must be solved are sparse , banded , and do not grow with increasing temporal order .",
    "for the calculations in this paper , we used polynomials of order 5 for both our spatial and temporal bases , and propagated with an accuracy goal of @xmath145 .",
    "as the spatial component @xmath146 of the last temporal basis function vanishes very rapidly with increasing @xmath147 , the maximum step size was limited , not by the accuracy of the propagator , but rather by the accuracy of a polynomial expansion for the temporal evolution @xmath148 of the source wavefunction .",
    "we illustrate our treatment of strong field ionization by comparing the evolution of the tunneling component to that of the full wavefunction resulting from half a cycle of an intense laser pulse . for our model atom",
    "we use a one dimensional soft core potential @xmath149 , where @xmath150 , whose ground state has energy @xmath151 . for laser electric field",
    "@xmath152 , we set @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( equivalent to an intensity of @xmath155 w/@xmath156 , consistent with many strong field experiments ) . the combination of ground state and laser pulse yielded a keldysh parameter @xmath157 , placing it in the intermediate range between the tunneling and multiphoton limits .",
    "we compare the evolution of the full wavefunction to that of the tunneling component using three different potentials for the propagator .",
    "first , we verify that our approach gives results identical to the homogeneous tdse by comparing comparing their evolution using the exact propagator .",
    "we then demonstrate the effects of an imperfect propagator by intentionally distorting the potential used in propagation .",
    "we perform one calculation using @xmath158 ( the well known strong field approximation ) and one with @xmath149 with @xmath159 , so that the potential is asymptotically correct but differs from the correct potential at short range .",
    "such a distortion is analogous to those which might arise in a single active electron mean field calculation , where the electron s interaction with the ion is correct at long range but differs from the true potential at short range .    in figures [ fig : velocitygauge_vs_fullwf ] and",
    "[ fig : lengthgauge_vs_fullwf ] , we show that the inhomogeneous schrdinger equation is identical to the homogeneous form for both the velocity and length gauge source terms . as discussed earlier , use of the `` length gauge '' source term is equivalent to using a quasistatic rather than a static wavefunction in the velocity gauge source term . in the present context",
    ", this means that the initial condition for the full wavefunction , when @xmath160 , must be the static bound state @xmath161 for comparison with the velocity gauge calculation , and the quasistatic state @xmath162 for comparison with the length gauge . as seen in these figures , both source terms give results which are identical to the full wavefunction in the region where @xmath163 .",
    "the apparent gauge dependence is thus reconciled : both gauges give results which are equivalent to the full tdse , and differ from each other only due to the use of different source terms .",
    "the strong field approximation is shown in figures [ fig : exact_vs_strongfield_velocitygauge ] and [ fig : exact_vs_strongfield_lengthgauge ] . here setting @xmath158 means that the propagator is incapable of treating a bound state correctly , so that the entire propagated wavefunction is projected into the continuum .",
    "as might be expected , propagating the full wavefunction gives results which bear no resemblance to the true behavior .",
    "in contrast , the inhomogeneous approach allows the propagator only to act on that portion of the wavefunction which differs from the initial bound state . here",
    "the tunneling components have magnitudes similar to the true tunneling components , with peaks somewhat displaced due to the different potentials seen by the continuum wavefunctions .",
    "as the strong field approximation is commonly used in analytical treatments of strong field ionization , we show in figure [ fig : exact_vs_strongfield_lengthgauge]b the ppt tunneling component taken from @xcite . as in @xcite , only the exponential suppression due to tunneling",
    "is calculated , so that the ionization amplitude has only exponential accuracy .",
    "the ppt wavepacket is much more localized than either the true tunneling component or the propagated strong field result , and has a considerably smaller amplitude . as interactions with the departing electron",
    "may cause dynamics within the parent ion , this may be an indication that more sophisticated treatments of strong field ionization will be necessary to describe processes such as multichannel ionization .    for our third calculation",
    ", we observe the results of a distorted short range potential in figures [ fig : exact_vs_rho_2.0_velocitygauge ] and [ fig : exact_vs_rho_2.0_lengthguage ] .",
    "in contrast to the strong field approximation , this propagator treats the wavefunction correctly when it is far from the molecule , but incorrectly when the electron is nearby .",
    "thus , propagating the full wavefunction will cause bound states to be projected into the continuum , but the continuum wavepacket will evolve correctly for most of its journey .    in the velocity gauge calculation , the full wavefunction shown in figure [ fig : exact_vs_rho_2.0_velocitygauge]a has a very similar peak structure to the exact solution , but overestimates the amplitude of the wavefunction far from the origin .",
    "the tunneling component in figure [ fig : exact_vs_rho_2.0_velocitygauge]b has amplitude comparable to the exact solution , but the maxima of the tunneling component are displaced somewhat from the exact solution .    for the length gauge calculation , the incorrect potential causes the initially quasistatic wavefunction to diverge strongly from the exact solution in figure [ fig : exact_vs_rho_2.0_lengthguage]a , as a portion of the initial state is projected into the continuum .",
    "in contrast , figure [ fig : exact_vs_rho_2.0_lengthguage]b shows a strong similarity between the exact and approximated tunneling components , with maxima which are once again displaced from the exact solution .",
    "this paper has addressed the problem of strong field ionization from the perspective of the time dependent schrdinger equation . defining the tunneling component as that part of the wavefunction which differs from a precalculated bound state",
    ", we derived an inhomogeneous schrdinger equation which governs its evolution .",
    "our approach is manifestly gauge invariant , and we have exploited this invariance to shed light on an apparent gauge dependence which has long been puzzling in the context of the strong field approximation .    while our approach is formally equivalent to the full time dependent schrdinger equation in the limit that an exact propagator is used , it eliminates a major error term when the propagation is approximate .",
    "it thus addressed a common problem in the theory of molecular strong field dynamics , where the computational methods necessary to describe the bound state may be prohibitively expensive to be used in a time dependent problem .",
    "use of the inhomogeneous schrdinger equation may thus represent a middle ground , allowing both the bound and the tunneling components to be treated using theoretical approaches which are most appropriate to the task .",
