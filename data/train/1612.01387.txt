    "the dama project is based on the development and use of low background scintillators . in particular , the second generation dama / libra apparatus @xcite , as the former dama / nai ( see for example ref . @xcite and references therein ) , is further investigating the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo by exploiting the model independent dm annual modulation signature , originally suggested in the mid 80s@xcite . at present dama / libra is running in its phase2 with increased sensitivity . the detailed description of the dama / libra set - up during the phase1 has been discussed in details in ref .  @xcite .    the signature exploited by dama / libra ( the model independent dm annual modulation ) is a consequence of the earth s revolution around the sun ; in fact , the earth should be crossed by a larger flux of dm particles around @xmath4 2 june ( when the projection of the earth orbital velocity on the sun velocity with respect to the galaxy is maximum ) and by a smaller one around @xmath4 2 december ( when the two velocities are opposite ) .",
    "this dm annual modulation signature is very effective since the effect induced by dm particles must simultaneously satisfy many requirements : the rate must contain a component modulated according to a cosine function ( 1 ) with one year period ( 2 ) and a phase peaked roughly @xmath4 2 june ( 3 ) ; this modulation must only be found in a well - defined low energy range , where dm particle induced events can be present ( 4 ) ; it must apply only to those events in which just one detector of many actually `` fires '' ( _ single - hit _ events ) , since the dm particle multi - interaction probability is negligible ( 5 ) ; the modulation amplitude in the region of maximal sensitivity must be @xmath4 7% for usually adopted halo distributions ( 6 ) , but it can be larger ( even up to @xmath4 30% ) in case of some possible scenarios such as e.g. those in ref .",
    "thus this signature is model independent , very discriminating and , in addition , it allows the test of a large range of cross sections and of halo densities .",
    "this dm signature might be mimicked only by systematic effects or side reactions able to account for the whole observed modulation amplitude and to simultaneously satisfy all the requirements given above .",
    "no one is available @xcite .",
    "the total exposure of dama / libra  phase1 is 1.04 ton @xmath1 yr in seven annual cycles ; when including also that of the first generation dama / nai experiment it is @xmath2 ton @xmath1 yr , corresponding to 14 annual cycles @xcite .    to point out the presence of the signal the time behaviour of the experimental residual rates of the _ single - hit _ scintillation events for dama / nai and dama / libra  phase1 in the ( 26 ) kev energy interval is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fg : res ] .",
    "the @xmath5 test excludes the hypothesis of absence of modulation in the data : @xmath5/d.o.f .",
    "= 83.1/50 for the ( 26 ) kev energy interval ( p - value = 2.2 @xmath1 10@xmath6 ) .",
    "when fitting the _ single - hit _ residual rate of dama / libra  phase1 together with the dama / nai ones , with the function : @xmath7 , considering a period @xmath8 yr and a phase @xmath9 day ( june 2@xmath10 ) as expected by the dm annual modulation signature , the following modulation amplitude is obtained : @xmath11 cpd / kg / kev corresponding to 9.2 @xmath3 c.l .. when the period , and the phase are kept free in the fitting procedure , the modulation amplitude is @xmath12 cpd / kg / kev ( 9.3 @xmath3 c.l . ) , the period @xmath13 year and the phase @xmath14 day , values well in agreement with expectations for a dm annual modulation signal . in particular , the phase is consistent with about june @xmath15 and is fully consistent with the value independently determined by maximum likelihood analysis @xcite . the run test and the @xmath5 test on the data have shown that the modulation amplitudes singularly calculated for each annual cycle of dama / nai and dama / libra  phase1 are normally fluctuating around their best fit values @xcite .",
    "we have also performed a power spectrum analysis of the _ single - hit _ residuals of dama / libra  phase1 and dama / nai @xcite , obtaining a clear principal mode in the ( 26 ) kev energy interval at a frequency of @xmath16 d@xmath17 , corresponding to a period of @xmath4 1 year , while only aliasing peaks are present just above .",
    "absence of any significant background modulation in the energy spectrum has been verified in energy regions not of interest for dm @xcite ; it is worth noting that the obtained results account of whatever kind of background and , in addition , no background process able to mimic the dm annual modulation signature ( that is able to simultaneously satisfy all the peculiarities of the signature and to account for the whole measured modulation amplitude ) is available ( see also discussions e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a further relevant investigation in the dama / libra  phase1 data has been performed by applying the same hardware and software procedures , used to acquire and to analyse the _ single - hit _ residual rate , to the _ multiple - hit _ one .",
    "in fact , since the probability that a dm particle interacts in more than one detector is negligible , a dm signal can be present just in the _ single - hit _ residual rate .",
    "thus , the comparison of the results of the _ single - hit _ events with those of the _ multiple - hit _",
    "ones corresponds practically to compare between them the cases of dm particles beam - on and beam - off .",
    "this procedure also allows an additional test of the background behaviour in the same energy interval where the positive effect is observed .",
    "in particular , the residual rates of the _ single - hit _ events measured in the ( 26 ) kev energy interval over the dama / libra  phase1 annual cycles , as collected in a single cycle , are reported in ref . @xcite together with the residual rates of the _ multiple - hit _ events in the same energy interval .",
    "a clear modulation satisfying all the peculiarities of the dm annual modulation signature is present in the _ single - hit _ events , while the fitted modulation amplitude for the _ multiple - hit _ residual rate is well compatible with zero : @xmath18",
    "cpd / kg / kev in the same energy region ( 26 ) kev .",
    "thus , again evidence of annual modulation with the features required by the dm annual modulation signature is present in the _ single - hit _ residuals ( events class to which the dm particle induced events belong ) , while it is absent in the _ multiple - hit _ residual rate ( event class to which only background events belong ) .",
    "similar results were also obtained for the last two annual cycles of the dama / nai experiment @xcite . since the same identical hardware and the same identical software procedures",
    "have been used to analyse the two classes of events , the obtained result offers an additional strong support for the presence of a dm particle component in the galactic halo .    by performing a maximum - likelihood analysis of the _ single - hit _ scintillation events , it is possible to extract from the data the modulation amplitude , @xmath19 , as a function of the energy considering @xmath201 yr and @xmath21 152.5 day .",
    "again the results have shown that positive signal is present in the ( 26 ) kev energy interval , while @xmath19 values compatible with zero are present just above ; for details see ref . @xcite .",
    "moreover , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the observed annual modulation effect is well distributed in all the 25 detectors , the annual cycles and the energy bins at 95% c.l .",
    "further analyses have been performed .",
    "all of them confirm the evidence for the presence of an annual modulation in the data satisfying all the requirements for a dm signal .",
    "sometimes naive statements were put forwards as the fact that in nature several phenomena may show some kind of periodicity .",
    "the point is whether they might mimic the annual modulation signature in dama / libra ( and former dama / nai ) , i.e.  whether they might be not only quantitatively able to account for the observed modulation amplitude but also able to contemporaneously satisfy all the requirements of the dm annual modulation signature .",
    "the same is also for side reactions .",
    "this has already been deeply investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ; the arguments and the quantitative conclusions , presented there , also apply to the entire dama / libra  phase1 data .",
    "additional arguments can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "no modulation has been found in any possible source of systematics or side reactions ; thus , cautious upper limits on possible contributions to the dama / libra measured modulation amplitude are summarized in ref .",
    "it is worth noting that they do not quantitatively account for the measured modulation amplitudes , and also are not able to simultaneously satisfy all the many requirements of the signature .",
    "similar analyses have also been done for the dama / nai data @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shone that , the muons and the solar neutrinos can not give any significant contribution to the dama annual modulation results .    in conclusion , dama give model - independent evidence ( at 9.3@xmath3 c.l .",
    "over 14 independent annual cycles ) for the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo .",
    "as regards comparisons , we recall that no direct model independent comparison is possible in the field when different target materials and/or approaches are used ; the same is for the strongly model dependent indirect searches . in particular , the dama model independent evidence is compatible with a wide set of scenarios regarding the nature of the dm candidate and related astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics ; as examples some given scenarios and parameters are discussed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "further large literature is available on the topics . in conclusion ,",
    "both negative results and possible positive hints are compatible with the dama model - independent dm annual modulation results in various scenarios considering also the existing experimental and theoretical uncertainties ; the same holds for the strongly model dependent indirect approaches ( see e.g. arguments in ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the _ single - hit _ low energy scintillation events collected by + dama / libra  phase1 have also been investigated in terms of possible diurnal effects@xcite .",
    "in particular , a diurnal effect with the sidereal time is expected for dm because of earth rotation ; this dm second - order effect is model - independent and has several peculiar requirements as the dm annual modulation effect has . at the present level of sensitivity",
    "the presence of any significant diurnal variation and of diurnal time structures in the data can be excluded for both the cases of solar and sidereal time ; in particular , the dm diurnal modulation amplitude expected , because of the earth diurnal motion , on the basis of the dama dm annual modulation results is below the present sensitivity @xcite",
    ". it will be possible to investigate such a diurnal effect with adequate sensitivity only when a much larger exposure will be available ; moreover better sensitivities can also be achieved by lowering the software energy threshold as in the presently running dama / libra  phase2 .",
    "the data of dama / libra  phase1 have also been used to investigate the so - called `` earth shadow effect '' which could be expected for dm candidate particles inducing nuclear recoils ; this effect would be induced by the variation  during the day  of the earth thickness crossed by the dm particle in order to reach the experimental set - up .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar effect can be pointed out only for candidates with high cross - section with ordinary matter , which implies low dm local density in order to fulfill the dama / libra dm annual modulation results .",
    "such dm candidates could get trapped in substantial quantities in the earth s core ; in this case they could annihilate and produce secondary particles ( e.g. neutrinos ) and/or they could carry thermal energy away from the core , giving potentiality to further investigate them . the results , obtained by analysing in the framework of the earth shadow effect the dama / libra  phase1 ( total exposure @xmath22 ton@xmath1yr ) data are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for completeness we recall that other rare processes have also been searched for by dama / libra - phase1 ; see for details refs . @xcite .",
    "an important upgrade has started at end of 2010 replacing all the pmts with new ones having higher quantum efficiency ; details on the developments and on the reached performances in the operative conditions are reported in ref . .",
    "they have allowed us to lower the software energy threshold of the experiment to 1 kev and to improve also other features as e.g. the energy resolution @xcite .      1 .   to increase the experimental sensitivity thanks to the lower software energy threshold ; 2 .",
    "to improve the corollary investigation on the nature of the dm particle and related astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics arguments ; 3 .   to investigate other signal features and second order effects",
    "this requires long and dedicated work for reliable collection and analysis of very large exposures .",
    "moreover , the possibility of a pioneering experiment with anisotropic znwo@xmath23 detectors to further investigate , with the directionality approach , those dm candidates that scatter off target nuclei is in progress @xcite .",
    "finally , future improvements of the dama / libra set - up to further increase the sensitivity ( possible dama / libra - phase3 ) and the developments towards the possible dama/1ton ( 1 ton full sensitive mass on the contrary of other kind of detectors ) , we proposed in 1996 , are considered at some extent . for the first case developments of new further radiopurer pmts with high quantum efficiency are progressed , while in the second case it would be necessary to overcome the present problems regarding : i ) the supplying , selection and purifications of a large number of high quality nai and , mainly , tli powders ; ii ) the availability of equipments and competence for reliable measurements of small trace contaminants in ppt or lower region ; iii ) the creation of updated protocols for growing , handling and maintaining the crystals ; iv ) the availability of large kyropoulos equipments with suitable platinum crucibles ; v ) etc .. at present , due to the change of rules for provisions of strategical materials , the large costs and the lost of some equipments and competence also at industry level , new developments of ultra - low - background nai(tl ) detectors appear to be quite difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "generally larger masses do not imply a priori larger sensitivity ; in case the dm annual modulation signature is exploited , the improvement of other parameters of the experimental set - up ( as e.g. the energy threshold , the running time , ... ) plays an important role as well .",
