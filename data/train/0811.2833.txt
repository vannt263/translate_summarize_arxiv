    "cmos monolithic active pixel sensors were first proposed as photo - detectors forty years ago . about a decade ago their use as charged particle detectors started to be explored , recognising that they represent an appealing technology offering small pixel size and the possibility of high speed read - out  @xcite .",
    "in addition to their use in charged particle tracking , they have been proposed and investigated for direct electron detection in electron microscopy , in particular in transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) as electron imagers  @xcite together with hybrid pixels  @xcite , as an advantageous alternative to ccds optically coupled to phosphor plates ( for a review of different detection technologies , see  @xcite ) .    for single particle tracking , it has been demonstrated that cmos pixels of order 10@xmath210  @xmath1m@xmath3 can reconstruct the position of impact of the particle with an accuracy of @xmath4 , by using the centre of gravity of the charge distribution  @xcite .",
    "owing to their thin sensitive region , confined to the @xmath510  @xmath1 m lightly - doped epitaxial layer , these sensors can be back - thinned down to @xmath6  50  @xmath1 m , without loss in performance  @xcite .",
    "the thin charge - collection region and total thickness of cmos pixel sensors is ideal in tem applications , where multiple scattering effects are significant , for obtaining a good point spread function ( psf ) . in the energy region of interest in tem , which is @xmath5 60 - 400  kev ,",
    "the specific energy loss , @xmath7 , varies by an order of magnitude but remains large enough to ensure single electron detection with large signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) values .",
    "for tem , the detector should record the position of a collection of electrons that represents a magnified image . whereas diffusion is beneficial for tracking applications , as it improves the determination of the charge centre of gravity , and thus of the particle impact point , to an accuracy significantly better than the pixel pitch , for tem diffusion is harmful , as it increases the psf and needs to be carefully evaluated .    while significant progress has been made in the last few years to develop cmos pixel sensors for tracking and vertexing applications in particle collider experiments , several issues , relevant to their application for fast nano - imaging at tem , remain to be addressed .",
    "in particular , their radiation hardness is a key challenge in the design of a detector for tem . unlike hep , where the total dose requirement can be estimated , based on integrated luminosity , tem requirements depend on the mode of operation . whereas the radiation hardness for the specimen can be easily specified ( in electrons per square angstrom ) , as the magnification is variable",
    ", this does not translate into a requirement on the detector .",
    "in addition , large numbers of electrons may be contained in a limited number of bragg spots , when operating in diffraction mode , causing large doses to be received by a small number of pixels .",
    "given that a very intense bright field image could deposit order of 10  rad  s@xmath8 pixel@xmath8 , a target radiation tolerance of @xmath9  1  mrad would enable its use for approximately one year , which appears to be a valid requirement .",
    "in this paper we present a prototype cmos active pixel sensor with radiation tolerant pixel cell design for use in tem .",
    "we evaluate its performance applying high energy physics ( hep ) modelling and experimental techniques to their characterisation as tem detectors .",
    "we study the particle energy loss , charge spread , point spread function and response after irradiation with 200  kev electrons and 29  mev protons for doses in excess to 1  mrad .",
    "data are compared to results of detailed simulation of electron interactions , energy loss and signal generation .",
    "we developed a new circuit , named ldrd2-rh , optimised for radiation tolerance , as a variation on a previous circuit , developed for hep applications  @xcite .",
    "the ldrd2-rh chip retains the original addressing and output circuitry .",
    "the sensor is divided into several sectors , each consisting of 24@xmath248 pixels arrayed on a 20  @xmath1 m pitch , in order to test different pixel layouts .",
    "the principle radiation damage mechanism is radiation - induced leakage current in the charge - collecting diode .",
    "this leakage current is primarily caused by the positive potential generated by trapped ( positive ) charge in the oxide above the p - type silicon , which results in inversion of the silicon at the si / sio@xmath10 interface . in each 20@xmath220  @xmath1m@xmath3 pixel , two 10@xmath220  @xmath1m@xmath3 pixels are drawn : each with the same design of the charge - collecting diode , and with the classical 3t - readout . for both sub - pixels ,",
    "the transistor sizes ( w / l ) are the same , but in one sub - pixel the transistor has a conventional linear layout , and in the other , an enclosed gate layout .",
    "figure  [ fig : layout ] shows some of the different diode layouts used .",
    "the detector has been fabricated in the ams 0.35  @xmath1 m 4-metal , 2-poly cmos - opto process , which has an epitaxial layer with a nominal thickness of 14  @xmath1 m .",
    "pixels are read out in rolling shutter mode , which ensures a constant integration time across the pixel matrix .",
    "pixels are clocked at 6.25  mhz and 25  mhz , corresponding to an integration time of 737  @xmath1s and 184  @xmath1s , respectively .",
    "the detector is readout through a custom fpga - driven acquisition board .",
    "a set of 14  bits , 40  msample / s adcs reads the chip outputs , while an array of digital buffers drives all the required clocks and synchronisation signals .",
    "the fpga has been programmed to generate the clock pattern and collect the data sampled by the adcs .",
    "a 32  bit - wide bus connects the fpga to a national instruments pci 6533 digital acquisition board installed on the pci bus of a control pc .",
    "data is processed on - line by a labview - based program , which performs the computation of the pixel noise and pedestal levels .",
    "results are given for the po pixel design , which was found to be best performing in terms of radiation tolerance , read out at 6.25  mhz , unless otherwise noted .",
    "the energy deposition in the sensor active layer and the lateral charge spread is simulated using two independent programs .",
    "the simulation of electron scattering in matter for applications in electron microscopy has been described in  @xcite .",
    "the first simulation program is inspired by this formalism , but with the relativistic corrections added , as required for accuracy at our energies of interest .",
    "the second simulation is based on the geant-4 program  @xcite and uses the low energy electromagnetic physics models  @xcite .    in both simulations",
    ", the cmos sensor is modelled according to the detailed geometric structure of oxide , metal interconnect and silicon layers , as specified by the foundry .",
    "electrons are incident perpendicular to the detector plane and tracked through the sensor . for each interaction within the epitaxial layer ,",
    "the energy released and the position are recorded .",
    "figure  [ fig : evt ] shows the sensor layout adopted in the simulation with the simulated trajectories of 200  kev electrons .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : radcomp ]    since the threshold energy for electrons to cause displacement damage in silicon is 260  kev  @xcite , we expect 200  kev to create only ionising damage .",
    "we investigated the effect of 29  mev protons , which damage the sensor via both ionisation and non - ionising energy loss .",
    "the irradiation has been performed at the base facility of the lbnl 88-inch cyclotron  @xcite .",
    "results are reported in details in  @xcite .",
    "one prototype sensor was irradiated with 29  mev protons up to a total integrated fluence of 8.5@xmath210@xmath11  p / cm@xmath3 , corresponding to a total dose of @xmath5  2  mrad . at equal doses ,",
    "a larger increase of the leakage current , compared to the electron irradiation , hints at a probable contribution from displacement damage .",
    "figure  [ fig : radpn ]  ( right ) shows the average pixel noise in the po sectors for elt and linear transistors ; it can be seen that while the noise of the elt layout cells remains basically unchanged over the dose range and only slightly increases at the highest doses , the noise of the standard layout cells is doubled after @xmath131  mrad . the increased leakage current can be controlled by cooling the chip .",
    "the po design with elt layout appears to be the most radiation tolerant of the designs tested in the ldrd2-rh chip .",
    "thin monolithic cmos pixel sensors with small , radiation tolerant pixels offer a very attractive solution for fast nano - imaging in transmission electron microscopy .",
    "the thin sensitive layer ensures a direct detection with small multiple scattering contribution to the point spread function .",
    "fast readout and single electron sensitivity in small pixel cells result in high resolution dynamic imaging .",
    "we have developed a prototype cmos pixel sensor implementing radiation tolerant cells .",
    "the sensor response in terms of energy deposition , charge spread and point spread function has been extensively tested for electrons in the energy range of interest for tem . a detailed simulation based on geant-4 and a dedicated charge generation and collection simulation package has been validated on the data recorded .",
    "the point spread function measured with 300  kev electrons is ( 8.1 @xmath0 1.6 )  @xmath1 m for 10  @xmath1 m pixel and ( 10.9 @xmath0 2.3 )  @xmath1 m for 20  @xmath1 m pixels , respectively , which agrees well with the values of 8.4  @xmath1 m and 10.5  @xmath1 m predicted by our simulation .    the radiation tolerance of pixels with enclosed transistors and specific diode design has been verified with 200  kev electrons and 29  mev protons .",
    "the pixel cells withstand doses in excess to 1  mrad , without significant degradation in noise and charge collection efficiency , making them well suited for a sensor for direct detection in tem .",
    "we wish to thank thomas duden , rolf erni , michael johnson , zhongoon lee , peggy mcmahan , marta rossell abrodos and the staff of the als and the 88-inch cyclotron for assistance and for the excellent performance of the accelerators .",
