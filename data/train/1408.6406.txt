    "<S> the degree of conditioning can be tuned to meet various requirements : a negative wigner function was obtained with success rate of @xmath71 and the negativity matches that in the unity - gain teleportation , while significantly suppressing the higher photon numbers , with success rate of @xmath76 . in order to approach ideal noiseless attenuation , </S>",
    "<S> the purity of the epr state must be improved , for which the effective loss @xmath77 , arising mainly from propagation loss , mode mismatch in homodyne measurements , and phase fluctuations in interferometers , need to be reduced .    </S>",
    "<S> conditional quantum teleportation is a very versatile tool . </S>",
    "<S> apart from its suitability for the transfer of both cv and dv @xcite states of light , it is capable of conditionally implementing a broad class of _ gaussian and non - gaussian quantum nonlinear filters _ on arbitrary unknown states of traveling light beam @xcite .    the probabilistic teleportation can be also used as a _ light - matter interface _ for atoms and mechanical oscillators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the purity - preserving aspect of the operation with conditional bell measurement allows to perfectly transfer individual fock states , produced by efficient single photon guns @xcite , from optical modes to modes of atomic ensembles or mechanical oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> this interface requires only weak gaussian entanglement , which can be produced by a weak light - matter interaction of the down - conversion kind , simply accessible for both the atomic ensembles and mechanical oscillators @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have experimentally demonstrated noiseless conditional teleportation of a single photon state . by conditioning on the results of the bell - type measurement before applying the feed - forward loop , we were able to reduce the value of the wigner function at the phase - space origin from positive values without conditioning to negative values after conditioning . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly confirms the feasibility of the noiseless teleportation , which can be used to qualitatively enhance the transmission of quantum states . </S>",
