    "calibration of apparatuses is the basis of any precise experiment , and the quest for precision and reliability is relentlessly increasing with the strict requirements of the new photonics , nanotechnology , and the new world of quantum information .",
    "the latter , in particular , depends crucially on the reliability of processes , sources and detectors , and on precise knowledge of all sources of noise , e.g. for error correction .",
    "but what does it mean to calibrate a quantum device ?",
    "it is really a much harder task than calibrating a classical `` scale '' .",
    "for example , for calibrating a photo - counter , we do nt have standard sources with precise numbers of photons  the equivalent of the `` standard weights '' for the scale . even worst , we never know for sure that all photons have been actually absorbed by the detector .",
    "the practical problem is then to perform a kind of _ quantum calibration _ to determine in a purely experimental manner ( by relying on some well established measuring instruments ) the quantum description of our device , without the need of a detailed theoretical knowledge of its inner functioning  being it a measuring apparatus , a quantum channel , a quantum gate , or a source of quantum states .    and",
    "here it comes the powerful technique of quantum tomography .",
    "originally invented for determining the quantum state of radiation ( for recent reviews see the book @xcite and e.  g. refs .",
    "@xcite , it soon became the universal measuring technique by which one can determine any ensemble average and measure the fine details of any quantum operation , channel , or measuring instruments  objects that before were just theoretical tools ( for history and references see next section ) .",
    "in the present short review article we will illustrate our latest theoretical developments on quantum tomography , consisting in a first systematic theoretical approach to optimization of both data - processing and setup .",
    "therefore , apart from the historical excursus of the next section , where we mention the relevant contributions from other authors , the body of the paper is focus only on our theoretical work .",
    "the basic tool of the theoretical approach is the _ informationally complete measurement _",
    "@xcite ( see refs . @xcite for applications in the present context)corresponding to the mathematical theory of operator bases .",
    "the optimization of data - processing @xcite relies on the fact that as an operator basis the informationally complete measurement is typically linearly dependent , allowing different expansion coefficients , which can be then optimized , according to specific criteria .",
    "the optimization theory for the setup @xcite , on the other hand , needs the new theory of quantum combs and quantum testers @xcite , novel powerful notions in quantum mechanics , which generalize those of quantum channel and of povm ( positive - operator - valued measure ) .",
    "these will be briefly reviewed in the section before conclusions .",
    "as the reader will see , the theoretical framework is sufficiently general and mature for a concrete optimization in the lab , i.e. accounting for realistic bounded resources , and this will be the direction of future development of the field .",
    "quantum tomography is a relatively recent discipline .",
    "however , the possibility of `` measuring the quantum state '' has puzzled physicists in the last half century , since the earlier theoretical studies of fano @xcite ( see also pauli in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . that more than two observables  actually a complete set of them , a so - called _ quorum of observables _ @xcite  are needed for a complete determination of the density matrix was immediately clear @xcite . however , in those years it was hard to devise concretely measurable observables other than position , momentum and energy ( royer pointed out that instead of measuring varying observables one can vary the state itself in a controlled way , and measure e.  g. just its energy @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , the fundamental problem of determining the quantum state remained at the level of mere speculation for many years .",
    "the issue finally entered the realm of experiments only less than twenty years ago , after the pioneering experiments by raymer s group @xcite , in the domain of quantum optics .",
    "why quantum optics ?",
    "because in quantum optics , differently particle physics , there is the unique opportunity of measuring all possible linear combinations of position and momentum of a harmonic oscillator , representing a single mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "such measurement can be achieved by means of a balanced homodyne detector , which measures the quadrature @xmath0 of a field mode at any desired phase @xmath1 with respect to the local oscillator ( lo ) [ as usual @xmath2 denotes the annihilator of the field mode ] . the first technique to reconstruct the density matrix from homodyne measurements  so called _",
    "homodyne tomography_originated from the observation by vogel and risken @xcite that the collection of probability distributions @xmath3 for @xmath4 is just the radon transform  i.e .",
    "the _ tomography_of the wigner function @xmath5 . therefore , by a radon transform inversion",
    ", one can obtain @xmath5 , and from @xmath5 the matrix elements of the density operator @xmath6 .",
    "this first method , however , works fine only for high number of photons or for _ almost classical _ states , whereas in the truly quantum regime is affected by the smoothing needed for the radon transform inversion . the main physical tool , however  i.e .",
    "using homodyning  was a perfectly good idea : one just needed to process the experimental data properly .    in ref.@xcite the first exact technique was given for measuring experimentally the matrix elements of @xmath6 in the photon - number representation , by just averaging functions of homodyne data .",
    "after that , the method was further simplified @xcite , and the feasibility for nonunit quantum efficiency @xmath7 at detectors  above some bounds  was established .",
    "further improvements in the numerical algorithms made the method so simple and fast that it could be implemented easily on small pcs , and the method became quite popular in the laboratories ( for the earlier progresses and improvements the reader can see the old review @xcite ) . in the meanwhile",
    "there has been an explosion of interest on the subject of _ measuring quantum states _",
    ", with hundreds of papers , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "the exact homodyne method has been implemented experimentally to measure the photon statistics of a semiconductor laser @xcite , and the density matrix of a squeezed vacuum@xcite .",
    "the success of optical homodyne tomography has then stimulated the development of state reconstruction procedures for atomic beams @xcite , the experimental determination of the vibrational state of a molecule @xcite , of an ensemble of helium atoms @xcite , and of a single ion in a paul trap @xcite , and different state reconstruction methods have been proposed ( for an extensive list of references of these first pioneering years , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "later the method of quantum homodyne tomography has been generalized to the estimation of an arbitrary observable of the field @xcite , with any number of modes @xcite , and , to arbitrary quantum systems via group theory @xcite , and with a general method for unbiasing noise @xcite .",
    "eventually , it was recognized that the general data - processing is just an application of the theory of operator expansions@xcite , which lead to identify quantum tomography as an _ informationally complete _ measurement @xcite  a generalization of the concept of _ quorum of observables _",
    "@xcite .",
    "state reconstruction was extended to the case where an _ incomplete _ measurement is performed . in this",
    "the reconstruction of the full density matrix of the system is actually impossible , and one can only estimate the state that best fits the measured data applying the jaynes s maximum entropy principle ( _ maxent _ ) @xcite . when one has some non - trivial prior information the fit can be improved by minimizing the kullback - leibler distance from a given state which represents this _ a priori _",
    "information @xcite .    at the same time , in alternative to the averaging data - processing strategy of the original method @xcite , it was recognized in refs .",
    "@xcite the possibility of implementing a maximum likelihood strategy for reconstructing the diagonal of the density matrix , and later for the full matrix @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the maximum likelihood strategy is that the density matrix is constrained to be positive , whereas positivity can be violated in the fluctuations of the averaging strategy .",
    "in addition , the maximum likelihood often allows to reduce dramatically the number of experimental data for achieving the same statistical error , at the expense of a bias , which is however negligible in many cases of practical interest",
    ". however , there is a drawback : this is the need of estimating the full density matrix ( the strategy is essentially a maximization of the joint probability of the full data - set over all possible density matrices , or bayesian variations of such maximization accounting for prior knowledge@xcite ) .",
    "this , on one side requires a cutoff of the dimension of the hilbert space when infinite ( such as for the harmonic oscillator , as in homodyne tomography ) , thus introducing the mentioned bias ; on the other side it has computational and memory complexities which increase exponentially with the number of systems for a joint tomography on multiple systems . on the contrary , the averaging strategy for any desired expectation value needs just to average a single function of the experimental outcome , without needing the full matrix , and this includes as a special case the evaluation of single matrix element itself , whence without necessitating a dimensional cutoff .",
    "contemporary to this preliminary evolution of data - processing methods , there has been also a parallel evolution in the tomographic setup design .",
    "it was realized that it is possible not only states , but also channels @xcite  the so - called ( standard quantum ) _ process tomography _ ( sqpt)based on the idea of tomographing the outputs of a channel corresponding to a set of input states making an operator basis for all density matrices .",
    "however , soon later it was recognized ( first for the diagonal matrix elements in the number basis of an optical process @xcite , then in general for any channel @xcite that the same process tomography can be actually achieved using just a single input state entangled ( with maximal schmidt number ) with an ancilla  the so - called _ ancilla - assisted process tomography _ ( aapt)exploiting the `` quantum parallelism '' of the entangled input state which plays the role of a `` superposition of all possible input states '' .",
    "this can have a great experimental advantage when the basis of states is not easily achievable experimentally , whereas the entangled state is , as in the case of homodyne tomography where it is easy to achieve such entangled state from parametric down - conversion of vacuum , whereas it is hard to achieve photon - number states ( see however , ref .",
    "@xcite , where a set of random coherent states have been proposed as a basis ) . as later proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , and experimentally verified in refs .",
    "@xcite , almost any joint system - ancilla state can be exploited for aapt . on the other hand ,",
    "the same aapt has been extended to quantum operations and to measuring apparatus @xcite ( former theoretical proposals for calibration of detectors were published without ancilla @xcite , and even ancilla - assisted @xcite ) .",
    "later , by another kind of quantum parallelism , it was recognized that one can also estimate the ensemble average of all operators of a quantum system by measuring only one fixed `` universal '' entangled observable on an extended hilbert space @xcite  a truly _",
    "universal observable_. at this point the tomographic method had reached the stage in which a single fixed apparatus ( single preparation of the input and single observable at the output ) is needed , in principle reducing enormously the experimental complexity for joint tomography on many systems ( complexity 1 versus exponential complexity ) .    after the first experimental sqpt by nmr @xcite , aapt was experimentally proved in refs .",
    "@xcite , for photon polarization qubit quantum operations , exploiting spontaneous parametric downconversion in a non linear crystal as a source of entangled states .    as in the case of state tomography ,",
    "the freedom in the choice of the experimental configuration poses the natural question of what is the optimal setup for a given figure of merit . in ref .",
    "@xcite the issue of minimizing the number of different experimental configurations needed for process tomography was raised again , and a the so - called direct characterization of quantum dynamics ( dcqd ) setup was introduced for qubits , later generalized to arbitrary finite dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "the proposed protocol starts from the expression of the choi - jamiokowski operator ( also called @xmath8-matrix ) @xmath9 of the quantum channel @xmath10 operating on the inputs state @xmath6 , choosing for the basis @xmath11 the shift - and - multiply group elements , and then uses techniques from error detection for the estimation of parameters @xmath12 from estimated error probabilities .",
    "the dcqd approach is interesting because of the interpretation of process tomography in terms of error detection , however , it does not provide any optimality argument in terms of number of experimental configurations , apart from a vague resource analysis @xcite . a similar scheme was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors provide a method for process tomography that allows to separately reconstruct the choi operator matrix elements in a fixed basis based by haar - distributed input state sampling .",
    "the authors exploit spherical @xmath13-designs @xcite in order to discretize the required averaging over the group @xmath14 .    in more recent years",
    "some experiments in the continuous - variable domain were performed both for process tomography @xcite and for measurement calibration @xcite , however both experiments exploited the sqpt technique , while no aapt experiments with continuous variable systems have been reported so far .",
    "many tomographic experiments on different kinds of quantum systems have been performed , like atoms in optical lattices @xcite , cold ions in paul traps @xcite , nmr probed molecules @xcite , solid state qubits @xcite , and quantum optic cavity modes interacting with atoms @xcite .    in the last decade",
    "the interest in quantum tomography grew very fast with the increasing number of applications in the hot field of quantum information , allowing testing the accuracy of state - preparation and calibration of quantum gates and measuring apparatuses .",
    "one should realize that the whole technology of quantum information crucially depends on the reliability of processes , source and detectors , and on precise knowledge of sources of noise and errors .",
    "for example , all error correction techniques are based on the knowledge of the noise model , which is a prerequisite for an effective design of correcting codes @xcite , and quantum process tomography allows a reliable reconstruction of the noise and its decoherence free subspaces without recurring to prior assumptions on the noisy channels @xcite .",
    "the increasingly high confidence in the tomographic technique , with the largest imaginable flexibility of data - processing , and expanding outside the optical domain in the whole physical domain , grew the appetite of experimentalists and theoreticians posing increasingly challenging problems .",
    "the relevant issues were now to establish the optimal tomographic setups and data - processing , and to minimize the physical resources , handling increasingly large numbers of quantum system jointly . regarding this last point ,",
    "a relevant issue is the exponentially increasing dimension of the choi operator of the quantum process versus the number of systems involved , and methods for safely neglecting irrelevant parameters in multiple qubit noise model reconstruction have been introduced @xcite based on assumptions of qubit noise independence and markovianity . in ref .",
    "@xcite , methods to tackle the case of sparse choi matrices are shown , expressing the minimum @xmath15-norm distance criterion in terms of a standard convex optimization problem . on the problem of optimizing data - processing ,",
    "on the other hand , upper bounds on minimal hilbert - schmidt distance between the estimated and the actual choi - jamiokowski state has been derived@xcite exploiting spherical @xmath13-designs .",
    "it can be shown that minimizing such a distance is equivalent to the minimizing the statistical error in the estimation of any ensemble average evolved by the channel .",
    "on the other hand , a systematic way of posing the problem of optimizing the data - processing is to fix a cost - function ( depending on the purpose of the tomographic reconstruction ) , and minimize the average cost  the canonical procedure in quantum estimation theory @xcite .",
    "the optimal data - processing for any measurement ( in finite - dimensions ) for estimating the expectation of any observable with minimum error was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , in regards of the optimal setups , an approach based on the theory of quantum combs and quantum testers @xcite have been introduced , that allowed to determine the optimal schemes ( minimizing the statistical error in estimating expectation values ) for all of the three kinds of tomography : state , process , and measurement @xcite ( quantum combs and quantum testers generalize the notion of channels and povm s ) .",
    "the optimal setups use up to three ancillas , and need only a single input state ( with bipartite entanglement only ) and the measurement of a bell basis , with a variable local unitary shifts of the ancillas .",
    "exploiting the same approach incomplete process tomography has been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite using `` process entropy '' , the analogous of the max - entropy method @xcite for process tomography .",
    "in the following we will treat linear operators @xmath16 from @xmath17 to @xmath18 as elements of a vector space , and the following formula is very useful @xmath19 in eq .",

    "the informational completeness is verified if the operator @xmath369 is invertible , namely ( see @xcite ) if , for every @xmath223 , @xmath370 which is obviously true for @xmath371 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq - psi ] ) .",
    "the same procedure can be carried on when the operator @xmath97 has the more general form @xmath372 , where @xmath224 are the projectors defined in ( [ eq - projcov ] ) . in this case",

    "@xmath97 has this form when optimizing measuring procedures of this kind : _ i _ ) preparing an input state randomly drawn from the set @xmath374 ; _ ii _ ) measuring an observable chosen from the set @xmath375 . with the same derivation , but keeping @xmath376 , one obtains the optimal tomography for general quantum operations . the special case of @xmath377 ( one has @xmath378 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - projcov ] ) ) corresponds to optimal tomography of states , whereas case @xmath377 ( @xmath379 ) gives the optimal tomography of povms .",

    "we prepare a pair of ancillary systems @xmath383 and @xmath384 in the joint state @xmath385 , then we apply two random unitary transformations @xmath386 and @xmath387 to @xmath381 and @xmath382 , finally we perform a bell measurement on the pair @xmath388 and another bell measurement on the pair @xmath389 .",
    "this experimental scheme realizes the continuous measurement by randomizing among a continuous set of discrete povm ; this is a particular application of a general result proved in @xcite .",
    "the scheme proposed is feasible using e.  g. the bell measurements experimentally realized in @xcite .",
    "we note that choosing @xmath380 maximally entangled ( as proposed for example in @xcite ) is generally not optimal , except for the unital case .",
    "the experimental schemes for povms / states are obtained by removing the upper / lower for branch quantum operations , respectively . in the remaining branch",
    "the bipartite detector becomes mono - partite , performing a von neumann measurement for the qudit , preceded by a random unitary in @xmath390 .",
