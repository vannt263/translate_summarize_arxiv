    "the noble gas isotope @xmath0kr is a radioactive nuclide with a half - life of 10.739 @xmath2 0.014 years @xcite .",
    "it occurs naturally in the atmosphere , produced by cosmic radiation , but at a rate four orders of magnitude lower than current global emission from nuclear fuel reprocessing @xcite . due to this",
    "anthropogenically increased abundance in the atmosphere and a precise understanding of its input function , @xmath0kr can be applied as a tracer to date young groundwater on the order of 5 - 50 years old .",
    "tracers in this age regime are crucial to water resource management given the global increased dependency on groundwater , including instances of complete dependency on young , shallow groundwater for drinking water @xcite .",
    "@xmath0kr provides an excellent complment for determining ages when taken with other existing tracers in this age regime , such as chlorofluorocarbons ( cfcs ) @xcite and @xmath3h/@xmath3he , which have both independent input functions .",
    "moreover , cfcs are subject to local contamination @xcite and @xmath3h/@xmath3he - dating is highly sensitive to natural degassing @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0kr is steadily released into the atmosphere in a manner that is both monitored and well understood @xcite , making it a robust tool for dating .    as a tracer for dating groundwater ,",
    "@xmath0kr has been successfully applied on many occasions using low - level gas proportional counting ( llc ) , both on its own @xcite and in conjunction with other isotopic tracers .",
    "@xmath0kr samples are collected by degassing groundwater samples in the field , and then separating krypton from the bulk gas in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "recent developments have both decreased seperation times and increased krypton yields of groundwater samples @xcite .    however , despite these improvements , @xmath0kr - dating has not been applied routinely at a large scale due to the slow processing time and comparatively large sample volume requirements of llc @xcite .",
    "the development of atom trap trace analysis ( atta ) , a laser - based atom counting method @xcite , has sought to provide the necessary tool to make large scale analysis of @xmath0kr viable .",
    "the atta-3 instrument at argonne national laboratory ( anl ) , has been used to routinely measure isotopic abundances of @xmath4kr and @xmath0kr in groundwater samples @xcite using 5 - 10 @xmath1l of krypton gas at stp extracted from 50 - 100 l of water . in the past , a single sample measurement required 48 hours .",
    "we report here on a new methodology for @xmath0kr analysis through atta .",
    "we demonstrate that , by using this method on a newly improved atta-3 system described in @xcite , we now have the ability to continuously measure @xmath0kr / kr ratios with 3 - 5% error every 4 hours , on average , increasing the sample throughput by a factor of twelve from @xcite .",
    "we do so with no increase in sample size requirements .",
    "we show this method to be linear and repeatable , and present an understanding and control over systematic effects due to cross - sample contamination on the 0.8% level .",
    "the atta technique is described fully in @xcite , but summarized here briefly : krypton gas is injected into a vacuum system and passes through a liquid - nitrogen - cooled , radio - frequency plasma discharge .",
    "the cooling slows the atoms and the plasma transfers a fraction of the atoms into a metastable electronic state . from this state , the atoms are resonantly excited with 811 nm lasers used throughout the system to further slow and trap the atoms in a magneto optical trap ( mot ) . by measuring the loading rates of both the radioactive ( @xmath4kr and @xmath0kr ) and stable ( @xmath5kr ) isotopes into the trap , we can obtain an isotopic ratio .",
    "furthermore , in order to remove any systematic effects from changes in efficiency that may occur in the system , we also measure a krypton reference gas immediately after measuring the sample that same day . with the isotopic ratios in both the sample and the reference , we ultimately report a  superratio \" ( sr ) defined for @xmath0kr as @xmath6 such a routine analysis of both the sample and the reference requires 6 hours of total atom trapping . at current ,",
    "however , the improved atta-3 system described in @xcite requires 24 hours to complete a single measurement .",
    "16 hours of this time is devoted to `` washing '' the system to decrease cross - sample contamination caused by our plasma discharge , which implants krypton ions from the sample into our vacuum chamber walls . to remove this implanted krypton the plasma discharge",
    "is run using argon gas .",
    "this process requires that the system return to room temperature to completely remove frozen krypton , meaning 2 hours of the time are spent warming and later re - cooling the liquid - nitrogen source .",
    "however , for measuring only @xmath0kr , we can employ a new method . since @xmath0kr",
    "/ kr isotopic abundances are 10 times higher than @xmath4kr / kr , a routine measurement would have sufficient statistics to reach a level of 2 - 3% error in 0.25 hours , subsequently reducing the amount of krypton being embedded in the system during such a short run .",
    "in addition , we can also remove the liquid - nitrogen cooling .",
    "this will increase the mean velocity of the atoms , reducing the efficiency of our trap by a factor of 4 , lengthening the measurement time to 1 hour ; however , it saves 2 hours by removing the heating / cooling cycle .    here",
    ", we present a new measurement procedure without liquid - nitrogen cooling for rapid - processing of @xmath0kr / kr ratios using the atta system .",
    "first we describe a contamination model for this new method that allows us to control the systematic effects caused from the residual cross - sample contamination .",
    "then we apply that model to six calibration samples measured in a 24-hour period .",
    "samples for this experiment were prepared at the university of bern and anl .",
    "their activities were measured using llc at the university of bern , and their @xmath0kr superratios , defined in equation ( [ sr ] ) , were measured using the routine atta technique that includes liquid - nitrogen cooling and is described at the beginning of this section .",
    "these results are reported in first two columns of table [ cal ] .",

    "measurements are conducted in the manner illustrated in figure [ procedure ] : a sample is measured for @xmath0kr / kr for 1 hour , followed by a 2.25 hour argon wash , another 1 hour sample measurement , a 1 hour reference measurement , and finally another 2.25 hour argon wash before the cycle is repeated .",
    "this timing permits us to measure the @xmath0kr / kr ratio of one sample every 4 hours , on average . to define a shorthand for the following sections , a measurement of ",
    "@xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 \" , would mean a measurement of s@xmath14 as the first sample and s@xmath15 as the second , followed by a reference measurement @xmath13 . during the sample measurements ,",
    "gas is recirculated in the system ( as it is for a typical atta measurement ) due to the small size of the samples . during the washes and the reference measurements ,",
    "the gas is flowed continuously and discarded .",
    "following the diagram in figure [ procedure ] , we consider the collective surfaces of atta-3 affected by implantation and the volume of sample gas to be two distinct reservoirs .",
    "the former is filled with contaminant from previous samples and the latter is filled with our sample to be measured .",
    "the contaminant has its own @xmath0kr / kr ratio , which we define as @xmath16 . due to the plasma discharge",
    "there is an exchange : sample gas enters the surface reservoir and contaminant leaks into the volume of the sample gas .",
    "the contamination that leaks into the sample becomes part of our measured value .",
    "the sample which enters into the surfaces replaces some fraction @xmath17 of the current contaminant in the reservoir , reducing the influence of each previous sample s contribution to the contaminant by some fraction 1-@xmath17 . .",
    "thus , if there is some contaminant @xmath16 before @xmath11 is measured , then after the wash we now have a contaminant @xmath18 we test such a model by attempting to find a repeatable value for @xmath17 .    to find @xmath17 we first need to know how much contamination we have in our system .",
    "we define @xmath19 , the average portion of the sample ( @xmath20 ) volume that is replaced by the contaminant ( @xmath16 ) during a measurement of the sample ( @xmath21 ) as @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the length of the measurement , @xmath24 is the linear outgassing rate of the contaminant , and @xmath25 is the pressure of the run .",
    "the only unknown here is the outgassing rate . to determine the rate we regularly conduct an outgassing test prior to each measurement :",
    "the system is filled with argon gas and the gas is recirculated with the plasma active .",
    "we then measure how much krypton leaches out of the wall over a few minutes using a srs residual gas analyzer and extrapolate a krypton outgassing rate due to the argon discharge , @xmath26 .",
    "however , we need to determine the krypton outgassing rate in the presence of a krypton discharge , which should be proportional , but not equal to the rate we have measured , i.e. @xmath27 .    to determine @xmath28 , we first clean the system for longer than the normal wash period such that the outgassing rate is more than a factor of 4 lower than the typical rates we expect in these measurements . in this `` clean start , ''",
    "if we measure @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 , then the contaminant @xmath29 when we measure @xmath12 .",
    "accordingly we obtain @xmath30 using our calibration samples , we start with a clean system and then measure j5-j0-r . this simplifies the above equation even further , since j0 is devoid of @xmath0kr ( `` @xmath0kr - dead '' ) and thus @xmath31 . with only the second term",
    ", we can solve for @xmath28 .",
    "we used three such measurements to determine that @xmath28 = 2.4 @xmath2 0.3 .",
    "now that we know the value of @xmath19 , we can work to find @xmath17 by applying the model .",
    "if we consider measuring @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath32 with our clean start , the model gives us the following for the third sample measurement @xmath33 from here , we can solve for @xmath17 .",
    "we ran two separate sequences , j2-j5-r - j0 and j5-j0-r - j0-j0 , to solve for @xmath17 and found that @xmath17 = 0.60 @xmath2 0.02 .",
    "note that we have considered the reference to both be a sampling _ and _ a wash procedure .",
    "yet , despite it only being 1 hour instead of 2.25 , we still found consistent results .",
    "the reason is that , as shown by solving for @xmath28 , a krypton wash is @xmath342.4 times more effective at extracting krypton than an argon wash .    with this repeatable value for @xmath17",
    "we have determined a simple and consistent model for describing our contamination in this rapid - processing mode .",
    "we measured six calibration samples in a 24-hour period ( measured in the order j2-j5-r - j0-j4-r - j1-j3-r ) .",
    "the @xmath0kr superratios determined from these measurements are listed in table [ cal ] in the third column , and listed with corrections from the contamination model in the fourth column .",
    "the llc activities of the samples are plotted against these corrected values in figure [ line ] and fit to a line .",
    "the measurement of j0 does not appear in the figure .",
    "the reduced chi - squared of the fit is we also see that in the six samples we measured the contamination fraction per sample saturated below the 2.5% level , as seen in figure [ con ] .",
    "based on this saturation level and the errors of our contamination model , the correction will add a maximum error of below 0.8% to the @xmath0kr / kr isotopic abundance measurements , which typically have 3 - 5% statistical error .        the rapid - processing measurements agreement with typical atta measurements and their linear relationship with llc activities , demonstrates the validity of this approach .",
    "this method increases the throughput of @xmath0kr / kr isotopic abundance measurements on a single atta system by a factor of twelve .",
    "the agreement of this calibration over such a large range of activities ( j5 being ) also shows that our contamination model can even handle enrichment levels we would normally wish to avoid in the standard atta system . with",
    "this rapid - processing procedure validated , atta is ready to increase the capacity for @xmath0kr - dating in the geoscience community .",
