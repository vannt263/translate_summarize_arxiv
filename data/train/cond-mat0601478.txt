    "<S> we study the evolution of the optical conductivity in the t - j model with temperature and doping using the extended dynamical cluster approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster approach results in an optical mass which is doping independent near half filling . </S>",
    "<S> the transition to the superconducting state in the overdoped regime is characterized by a decrease in the hole kinetic energy , in contrast to the underdoped side where kinetic energy of holes increases upon superfluid condensation . in both regimes , the optical conductivity displays anomalous transfers of spectral weight over a broad frequency region .    </S>",
    "<S> how superconductivity emerges from a strongly correlated normal state is one of the most important problems in the field of strongly correlated electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> this problem has received intensive attention of the past two decades spurred by the discovery of high temperature superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of experimental probes have been applied to this problem , but there is , at this point , no theoretical concensus on the basic physics or the minimal model required to describe this rich phenomena .    in recent years , significant progress has been achieved through the development of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite and its generalizations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach , allows us to isolate which aspects of the physics of a given material can be understood within a local approach , and what is the minimal cluster size required to describe certain phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> for example it has been shown that a single site method describes well the physics of the finite temperature mott transition in materials such as @xmath0 in a broad region of temperature and pressures around the mott endpoint , while the interplay of peierls and mott instabilities in materials such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 requires a two site link as a minimal reference frame @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is an evidence that the hubbard or the t - j model treated by a four site cluster dmft approach captures many essential aspects of the physics of the cuprates such as its phase diagram @xcite , the variation of the spectral function and the electron lifetime along the fermi surface @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this approach systematizes and extends the early slave boson treatments of the cuprates which now appear as restricted low energy parameterizations in a more general approach .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most powerful bulk probes of carrier dynamics is optical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies of optics in t - j and hubbard model @xcite have allowed an accurate description of many experimentally observed anomalies found in the cuprate superconductors at high temperatures , around or above the normal temperature . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we use the cluster extension of dmft , which allows us to study the evolution of the optical conductivity in the most interesting temperature regime around the transition from anomalous metal to d - wave superconductor . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we gain several new insights and we show theoretically that : a ) while optical spectral weight is reduced in the underdoped side , the optical mass of the carriers remains constant . </S>",
    "<S> b ) the changes in hole kinetic energy when entering the superconducting state are much smaller than in the hubbard model , and are positive in the overdoped side and negative in the underdoped regime . </S>",
    "<S> c ) the broad redistribution of spectral weight which is observed in the superconducting state is largely due to the anomalous greens function , and in this respect optical measurements combined with theory allows us to extract additional information not available from photoemission spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> d ) at optimal doping , the low frequency part of optical conductivity is drude like while the intermediate range shows approximate powerlaw @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> all these findings are consistent with experiments and can be understood in terms of a plaquette embedded in a correlated medium but not in terms of a single site theory .    </S>",
    "<S> _ formalism _ our starting point is the t - j model which was proposed by p.w . </S>",
    "<S> anderson as a minimal model to describe the cuprate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we use an exact reformulation of this model in terms of a spin fermion model using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation to decouple the spin interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the effective action describing the interaction of fermions with spin fluctuations takes the following form    @xmath4    \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the hubbard u term in the action will be taken to infinity to enforce the constraint .    </S>",

    "<S> \\label{functional}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we chose extended dynamical cluster approximation method ( edca ) @xcite on a plaquette because it is the simplest mean field theory that justifies ignoring the vertex corrections of optical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the only approximation of the edca is to replace the green s functions in the interacting part of the functional @xmath6 $ ] with the corresponding course grained cluster green s functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 where the sum @xmath9 is over those @xmath10 momenta in brillouin zone which correspond to certain cluster momenta @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the saddle point equations of the functional eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ functional ] are @xmath12 and @xmath13 which automatically give pice - vise constant self - energies . together with the dyson equations @xmath14 and @xmath15 form a closed set of equations . </S>",
    "<S> few comments are in order : i ) the bosonic self energy is simply related to the spin susceptibility @xcite @xmath16 and this expression can be used to calculate bosonic self - energy knowing local spin - susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) the baym - kadanoff functional @xmath6 $ ] which depends only on the cluster green s functions can be obtained by solving the cluster problem coupled to the fermionic and bosonic bath @xcite . as an impurity solver we use exact diagonalization for the cluster and an nca approach to treat the hybridization of the cluster with the bath . to study superconductivity </S>",
    "<S> we allow the off - diagonal long range order by employing the nambu method of anomalous green s functions .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical conductivity of the plaquette within edca is particularly simple because the vertex corrections vanish just like in single site dmft . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that all four cluster @xmath11-points of the plaquette are course - grained over the part of the brillouin zone which is particularly symmetric , namely @xmath10 as well as @xmath17 point for each @xmath10 point are in the same cluster region . </S>",
    "<S> since the current vertex depends only on the cluster @xmath11 point , the vertex legs can be closed and coarse - grained @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> since velocity is even function of @xmath10 and @xmath19 at fixed cluster @xmath11 depends of @xmath10 only through @xmath20 , this quantity vanishes .    </S>",

    "<S> [ optics_linear ] we show the evolution of the optical conductivity for various temperatures and dopings from room temperature @xmath22 down to transition temperature @xmath23 and slightly below the transition @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we have representatives of the three regimes of the cuprate superconductors , slightly underdoped @xmath25 , optimally doped @xmath26 and the overdoped case @xmath27 . in agreement with experiments on high tc s , and with earlier theoretical single site dmft studies </S>",
    "<S> , the optical conductivity extends over a broad frequency range , and consist of a broad drude component at low frequencies that sharpens with decreasing temperature and a higher frequency ( `` mid infrared '' ) component with substantial intensity at high frequencies .    upon entering the superconducting state </S>",
    "<S> no real optical gap opens below the transition , unlike the standard case of the s - wave bcs superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> however , a substantial reduction of the optical conductivity due to superconductivity is observed up to very high frequency even beyond @xmath28 which is ten times bigger that the superconducting gap at optimal doping @xmath29 itself .    </S>",
    "<S> the drude - like low frequency conductivity narrows as the temperature decreases from room temperature to just above @xmath30 and continues to grow even below the transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement of the low frequency conductivity as a result of the onset of coherence is seen in many experimental studies @xcite and should be contrasted with the reduction of the conductivity at higher frequencies due to the opening of a gap .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical conductivity has a very long tail of incoherent spectral weight that dominates the optics . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the tail seems to have an approximate power law @xmath31 with the exponent close to @xmath32 @xcite in agreement with experiments @xcite . at low frequency , </S>",
    "<S> optical conductivity is lorentzian - like at optimal doping with @xmath33 scaling . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eff_mass]c we plot @xmath34 as a function of @xmath33 which is temperature independent quadratic parabola in the region @xmath35 in agreement with recent experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the peak around @xmath36 is the standard bcs coherence peak arising from the excitations across the superconducting gap in one particle density of state and is not visible in experiment which is closer to the clean limit than our theoretical calculation which overstimates the scattering rate .     and plasma frequency versus doping . </S>",

    "<S> the optical weight in sc state missing in the finite frequency region collapses into @xmath38 function . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral weight is restored when integral is taken up to @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> c ) the inverse of low frequency optical conductivity @xmath40 versus @xmath33 is quadratic parabola independent of temperature in the optimal doping regime . </S>",
    "<S> optical conductivity is thus drude - like at low frequency up to @xmath41 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> optical conductivity measurements can be used to define an optical effective mass defined by @xmath42 the plasma frequency in this equation is proportional to the kinetic energy of the model and at the same time , to the integral of the optical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this definition can be motivated by the extended drude model of reference . here </S>",
    "<S> we see that the cluster dmft method introduces new physics not captured by the single site approach .    </S>",
    "<S> in single site dmft the optical mass diverges as the mott transition is approached . taking into account the low frequency and low temperature expansion of the self - energy in the local fermi - liquid state @xmath43 one obtains for the conductivity @xmath44 and therefore </S>",
    "<S> the optical mass in single site dmft is @xmath45 and diverges as mott transition is approached since @xmath46 vanishes .    in the cluster case , </S>",
    "<S> the mass no longer diverges . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eff_mass]a , we show the optics mass from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ effe_mass ] where @xmath47 was computed by integrating the optical conductivity up to @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> when approaching mott transition , the effective mass becomes 5-times bigger than the electron mass while it drops down to 3-times the electron mass in the overdoped regime . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is very similar to the recent experiments on cuprates reported in . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma frequency in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ effe_mass ] , which is proportional to the integral of optical conductivity , grows linearly at small doping and the slope gets less steep around 10% doping in accordance with recent experiments on cuprates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the edca equations in the @xmath49 plaquette provide us with a simple description of how the the mott insulating state is approached , since one has only four different patches in momentum space , which however , change very differently with doping . </S>",
    "<S> the self energy that is relevant to the optical conductivity corresponds to the patch around @xmath50 and @xmath51 and has a quasiparticle residue which is approximately doping independent and finite ( @xmath52 ) as the mott insulator is approached . </S>",
    "<S> however , the optical conductivity vanishes with vanishing doping just like the plasma frequency in fig .  [ eff_mass ] . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is driven by the vanishing of the number of carriers measured by the length of the active segment of the fermi surface , which goes to zero as the mott point is approached , rather than with vanishing of quasiparticle renormalization amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation of the edca results is consistent with the results obtained by the cumulant periodization of cdmft @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ transfer of spectral weight _ - a surprising aspect of the physics of strongly correlated materials , is that low energy phenomena affect the spectra of the material over a very large energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> this general phenomena is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eff_mass]b , which shows the integral of optical spectral weight in the normal and the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> low energy phenomena like the onset of superconductivity which involves a scale of a fraction of j , involves redistribution of optical weight of the order of @xmath53 which is 40 times more than the gap value . </S>",
    "<S> this large range of redistribution of spectral weight was also measured on cuprates and pointed out in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a new theoretical insight is that the high frequency redistribution of weight comes from the anomalous greens function @xmath54 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ opt_conductivity ] ) and hence can not be observed in the density of states or arpes measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> _ sum rule _ - to understand the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity , much effort was recently devoted to measure the change of kinetic energy upon superfluid condensation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally this is measured by integrating conductivity up to large enough cutoff of the order of @xmath55 in both normal and superconducting state , and interpreting the results in terms of the optical sum rule which states @xmath56 this sum rule has also been extensively discussed in the context of the hubbard model , in which case , assuming nearest neighbor hopping matrix elements only , the operator on the right hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sumri ] is the kinetic energy of the electrons in the hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown by jarrell and collaborators @xcite that entering the superconducting state results in a reduction of kinetic energy , in stark contrast with the bcs model where the kinetic energy increases upon entering the superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy of the hubbard model is composed of two different contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the superexchange energy of the spins , and the kinetic energy of the holes . in the hubbard model </S>",
    "<S> the optical transitions at energies of order u , give rise to the superexchange energy of the spins , while the low energy transitions correspond to the kinetic energy of the holes , but it is not possible to separate those two contributions in the hubbard model . here </S>",
    "<S> we sharpen the analysis of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , by evaluating separately these two physically different contributions , which allows us to make direct contact with optical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the experiments measure the kinetic energy of the holes since the cuttoffs which are used are such that the transitions into the upper hubbard band are not included .    ; </S>",
    "<S> red squares - @xmath57 ; green diamonds - @xmath58 ; black with circles - @xmath59 . ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ energies ] , we show the change of kinetic energy of holes , the superexchange energy ( @xmath60 ) and total energy upon condensation as obtained from our edca cluster calculation . the kinetic energy can be directly calculated from the spectral function and the superexchange energy from the spin susceptibility . in agreement with very recent experiments on cuprates </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and in agreement with rvb and slave - boson prediction , we see that the change in kinetic energy upon superfluid condensation changes sign between overdoped to underdoped regime . in overdoped regime , the conventional bcs picture is applicable where kinetic energy of holes increases while the superexchange energy decreases just like the interaction energy in conventional phonon mediated superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the later change is much larger such that the total condensation energy is positive . </S>",
    "<S> in underdoped regime , the superexchange energy still decreases upon condensation and gives the largest contribution to the condensation energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the kinetic energy of holes is gained in uderdoped case so that the kinetic energy gives positive contributes to condensation in agreement with recent experiment @xcite .    in fig  ( [ energies ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we also show the change of chemical potential upon condensation . similarly to kinetic energy , it also changes sign with doping and it increases in underdoped regime while it decreases in overdoped regime . </S>",
    "<S> we believe this is a consequence of the asymmetry of the normal as well as the superconducting one particle density of states .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion _ - in conclusion , we have studied the t - j model using the edca in a plaquette near the optimally doped regime . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results capture the main features of the optical conductivity near the transition from a strongly correlated metal to a superconductor . in spite of the shortcomings of the approximation used ( the edca @xmath49 cluster overestimates the superconducting critical temperature and the quasiparticle scattering rates ) we believe that the lessons from this mean field theory , as to the physical origin of the scaling of the optical mass with doping , the anomalous redistribution of spectral weight and the changes of kinetic and exchange energy upon entering the superconducting state are general , and can be derived with considerable more effort in other cluster schemes , or using larger clusters . </S>",
    "<S> they stress the importance of the differentiation of states in momentum space in strongly correlated materials near the mott transition . </S>"
