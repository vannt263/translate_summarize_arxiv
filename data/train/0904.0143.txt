    "saturn s a and b - rings sport an abundance of irregular radial structure which , though aesthetically pleasing , presents something of a puzzle to the theoretician .",
    "the instruments aboard the _ cassini _ space probe show that these patterns manifest on a vast range of length - scales and can take quite different forms .",
    "for instance , there exist quasi - periodic microstructure on scales of 0.1 km ( colwell et al .  2007 ; thomson et al .  2007 ) , discontinuous and irregular striations on the 1 - 10 km intermediate scale , and much broader 100 km undulations ( porco et al .  2005 ) .",
    "in addition to the difficulties involved in tackling these three orders of magnitude , there are the formidable modelling questions posed by a cold disk of densely - packed , inelastic , and infrequently colliding particles ( stewart et al .",
    "1984 , araki and tremaine 1986 , salo 1991 , hmeen - antilla and salo 1993 , schmidt et al .",
    "2001 , latter and ogilvie 2008 ) .",
    "this paper will focus on only a subset of these phenomena , the smaller - scale variations , and will not linger especially on the modelling issues .",
    "specifically , it investigates how the quasi - periodic microstructure relates to the viscous overstability , on one hand , and to structure formation on the intermediate scales , on the other .",
    "the variations on the much longer 100 km scale are not examined , and we suspect that they have their origin in a different mechanism entirely , perhaps ballistic transport ( durisen 1995 ) .",
    "our starting point is the viscous overstability , which is now regarded as a key player in the short scale radial dynamics of saturn s rings ( schmit and tscharnuter 1995 , schmidt et al .",
    "2001 , spahn and schmidt 2006 , latter and ogilvie 2008 ) .",
    "the viscous overstability is an axisymmetric oscillatory instability that afflicts the homogeneous state of keplerian shear .",
    "growing modes rely on the alliance of the fluid disk s inertial - acoustic oscillations with the disk s stress oscillations : variations in the stress extract energy from the keplerian shear and inject it into the inertial - acoustic wave ; but the increased motion this induces magnifies the stress oscillation itself which can extract even more energy , and so the process runs away .",
    "the feedback loop requires ( a ) the stress to efficiently remove energy from the keplerian flow and ( b ) the two oscillations to communicate effectively , in particular for them to be in phase . the first condition is tied to the stress s sensitivity to surface density .",
    "the second condition is often violated in dilute rings and turbulent disks , where the stress can lag behind the epicycles and the overstability fails to work ( ogilvie 2001 , latter and ogilvie 2006a ) .    the instability s linear theory has been well established by a variety of theoretical approaches : hydrodynamics ( schmit and tscharnuter 1995 , schmidt et al .",
    "2001 ) , @xmath0-body simulations ( salo 2001 , salo et al .",
    "2001 ) , and kinetics ( latter and ogilvie 2006a , 2008 ) .",
    "however , its nonlinear theory has received surprisingly little attention .",
    "two hydrodynamical studies exist , a large - scale nonlinear simulation of a ring annulus in 1d ( schmit and tscharnuter 1999 ) and a weakly nonlinear analysis ( schmidt and salo 2003 ) .",
    "the simulations show that the nonlinear evolution of an overstable disk is characterised by significant disorder .",
    "in contrast , the latter study suggests that an overstable ring may exhibit simple coherent structures which take the form of travelling waves .",
    "because schmit and tscharnuter impose reflecting boundary conditions , and hence break translational symmetry , such coherent structures may have been difficult to observe in their simulations .",
    "certainly , more simulations need to be undertaken and the influence of the boundary conditions better understood .",
    "concurrently , a fully nonlinear theory extending the work of schmidt and salo is required to fully establish the existence of the nonlinear solutions .",
    "the former project we present elsewhere , the latter we present here .",
    "first , we demonstrate that steady nonlinear travelling wavetrains are exact solutions to the governing nonlinear equations of a viscously overstable disk , and second , that these solutions are the loci of a rich secondary set of dynamics which generate irregular variations in the waves amplitude and wavenumber .",
    "we propose that viscously overstable regions in the a and b - rings support a bed of travelling wavetrain solutions and these structures correspond to the quasi - periodic variations registered by cassini s uvis and rss instruments ( the radial ` microstructure ' ) .",
    "modulations and defects in the amplitudes and wavelengths of these wavetrains may yield different optical properties which can be traced by the cassini cameras .",
    "consequently , we hypothesise that these larger - scale variations are associated with the intermediate 1 - 10 km structures observed ( porco et al .",
    "our hypotheses are investigated with a one - dimensional , isothermal fluid model endowed with a navier - stokes stress .",
    "though simplistic , it should predict qualitatively correct behaviour , while permitting the problem to be attacked analytically or semi - analytically .",
    "importantly , self - gravity is omitted throughout , but we investigate its role in a following paper .",
    "this is mainly for readability as the nonself - gravitating dynamics is sufficiently complex on its own .",
    "a study of nonlinear waves connects naturally to the extensive field of wave propagation in thin astrophysical disks ( kato 2000 ) , and in particular to the launching of spiral density waves ( goldreich and tremaine 1978a , 1979 , 1980 , borderies et al .",
    "1983 , 1986 , shu et al .  1985a , 1985b ) . in the latter studies the emphasis has been on the launching of spiral waves by an external potential ,",
    "as might issue from a moon , and the damping of such waves by a viscous stress .",
    "but the viscous stress can be an engine of growth also , as in the development of global eccentric modes and narrow ringlets ( borderies et al .",
    "1985 , papaloizou and lin 1988 , lyubarskij et al .",
    "1994 , longaretti and rappaport 1995 , ogilvie 2001 ) and the axisymmetric viscous overstability itself ( kato 1978 , schmit and tscharnuter 1995 ) . in this paper",
    "it will be shown that the viscous forces in a planetary ring can balance energy dissipation and injection and thus sustain _ steady _ wave structures .",
    "a study of nonlinear wavetrains also connects to the perhaps more massive field of nonlinear waves in general media and 1d reaction  diffusion systems especially , the model equation of which is the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( aranson and kramer 2002 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the complex ginzburg - landau equation is remarkably rich and may provide a template for the study of viscous overstability in saturn s rings . as in a fluid disk ,",
    "the equation admits a trivial homogeneous solution that is susceptible to an oscillatory linear instability via a hopf bifurcation ( the analogue of the viscous overstability ) ; it also supports both stable and unstable steady nonlinear wavetrains .",
    "variations upon the wavetrains exhibit a wide variety of behaviours ranging from smooth modulations to abrupt jumps in wavenumber and amplitude ( sources and shocks ) , as well as small - scale chaotic fluctuations ( bernoff 1988 , shraiman et al .",
    "1992 , chat 1994 , aranson and kramer 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , the sources and shocks can partition the radial domain into a one - dimensional cellular structure , in which each ` cell ' is characterised by a different wavetrain ( chat 1993 , popp et al .",
    "1994 , ipsen and hecke 2001 ) .",
    "the latter behaviour seems especially pertinent to ring structure on intermediate scales , which cassini s cameras show as a pattern of irregularly spaced , disjunct bands ( porco et al .  2005 ) .",
    "0.3 cm    a summary of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , space will be lent to a discussion of the validity of the simple hydrodynamic model that we employ , the parameters it introduces , and the values these should take . in section 3 , which comes next , a brief summary of the linear stability of the homogeneous state of keplerian shear will be presented . though these results have appeared a number of times elsewhere ( schmit and tscharnuter 1995 , schmidt et al .",
    "2001 ) , we include them for completeness .",
    "section 4 will demonstrate the existence and investigate the properties of axisymmetric , steady , nonlinear , travelling wavetrains in a viscously overstable disk .",
    "the nonlinear wave profiles are calculated numerically via the solution of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem and analytically in the limit of long wavelength .",
    "we find that an overstable disk supports a one - parameter family of wavetrain solutions , the members of which can be parametrised by their wavenumber @xmath1 . in section 5",
    "we establish the linear stability of the wavetrains and find that above a critical wavelength @xmath2 the wavetrains are linearly stable . for model parameter values , associated with optical depths of 11.5 ,",
    "the critical wavelength is approximately @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the scale height of the disk .",
    "the critical wavelength appears consistent with cassini observations of periodic microstructure .",
    "lastly , in section 6 , we discuss more fully the general nonlinear dynamics of an overstable disk . a rough argument",
    "is sketched explaining the upward cascade to longer scales observed in the simulations of schmit and tscharnuter ( 1999 ) and we suggest that , irrespective of self - gravity , this ` inverse cascade ' should halt ( or at least change qualitatively ) once most power reaches a lengthscale near @xmath2 .",
    "a discussion follows which addresses what this saturated state may look like .",
    "modulations and defects in the wavetrains wavenumber and amplitude are touched on , and a multiple - scales analysis presented in which we show that sources and shocks in the wavetrains phase may develop .",
    "finally we discuss the relevance of the complex ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "section 7 presents our conclusions , in which we summarise the paper , and point out the issues which remain unresolved and necessary future work .",
    "in order to bring out the important features of the ring s nonlinear evolution we employ a simple hydrodynamical model that captures the correct qualitative behaviour while not burdening the analysis or obscuring its interpretation with mathematical complexity . the ring is assumed to be a vertically - averaged , non - self - gravitating , isothermal , ideal gas possessing a newtonian viscous stress .",
    "in addition , the shearing and bulk viscosities depend on surface density as power laws , in accordance with schmit and tscharnuter ( 1995 , 1999 ) and schmidt et al .",
    "we also work with the shearing sheet approximation , which is a cartesian representation of a ` patch ' of disk orbiting the central planet with frequency @xmath5 , and in which @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the radial and azimuthal dimensions respectively ( see goldreich and lynden - bell 1965 ) .",
    "the governing equations are @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the vertically integrated density , pressure , and viscous stress , and @xmath12 is the planar fluid velocity .",
    "the tidal potential is @xmath13 .",
    "the pressure comes from the ideal gas equation of state @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "the viscous stress is given by @xmath16 the kinematic shear and bulk viscosities are parametrised as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are dimensionless parameters , and @xmath21 is the surface density of the homogeneous state of keplerian shear .    throughout the paper",
    "we employ dimensions so that @xmath22 one unit of time is therefore @xmath23 times an orbital period and the unit of length is @xmath24 , the scale height of the disk .",
    "the full set of governing parameters is now @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "of course , much can be said about each of the model assumptions .",
    "we shall say but a little .",
    "first , the adoption of vertical averaging limits us to radial scales much longer than the disk scale height , @xmath4 . the shearing sheet on the other hand limits us to scales much shorter than the disk radius .",
    "neither constraint is much of a problem because the lengthscales of the phenomena we examine sit well within this enormous range .",
    "more of an issue is the neglect of the vertical motions .",
    "for instance , the viscous overstability is usually accompanied by vertical ` breathing ' or ` splashing ' and may be significant when combined with nonisothermal behaviour .",
    "we , however , leave this issue open for the time being .",
    "a real planetary ring is not generally isothermal . due to the relative infrequency of collisions ,",
    "the thermal time - scale is of the same order as the dynamical time - scale , as kinetic theories and @xmath0-body simulations show ( goldreich and tremaine 1978b , stewart et al .",
    "1984 , brahic 1977 ) . that said , when collisions are a little more frequent  as in a dense ring which may support some tens of collisions per orbit  the isothermal model affords an acceptable approximation ( salo et al .",
    "2001 , latter and ogilvie 2008 ) .",
    "a dense ring is not an ideal gas , and is probably better suited to a polytropic equation of state which can better capture the effects of close packing and nonlocal pressure ( schmidt et al .",
    "2001 , schmidt and salo 2003 , latter and ogilvie 2008 ) .",
    "we persist , however , with the simpler model in the belief that the errors introduced do not alter the qualitative behaviour .",
    "finally , it should be acknowledged that the viscous stress of a planetary ring behaves in a way not always captured by a simple navier - stokes stress .",
    "for instance , in a dilute ring , effects associated with nonlocality in time ( ` memory effects ' ) are important because the translational stress relaxes on a time - scale comparable to the dynamical time - scale ( latter and ogilvie 2006a ) . in contrast , a dense ring possesses a stress dominated by the collisional component , and , though local in time , will be a nonlinear function of the rate of strain ( latter and ogilvie 2008 ) .",
    "the navier - stokes model , however , offers a reasonable approximation of the dense system , particularly as we may ` tweak ' the parameter @xmath20 in order to roughly ` compensate ' for the linearisation in strain .",
    "self - gravity is excluded in this paper and will be examined separately in a subsequent article .",
    "it undoubtedly plays a role in both the axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric dynamics of an overstable disk but the effects are complicated and deserve a special treatment .",
    "in addition , @xmath0-body simulations show that nonaxisymmetric self - gravity wakes hinder the development of the linear modes ( schmidt et al .",
    "2001 ) , and it is most probable that they impact on the nonlinear dynamics as well .",
    "this is an important issue but one that can only be resolved satisfactorily by three - dimensional simulations .",
    "aside from these theoretical issues , we are encouraged to use the isothermal hydrodynamic model because it predicts qualitatively correct behaviour when compared with @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the linear growth rates of the overstable modes are adequately approximated ( schmidt et al .",
    "2001 ) as is the weakly nonlinear evolution of their amplitudes ( schmidt and salo 2003 ) . for these reasons",
    "the hydrodynamic parameter values we use will be set equal to those computed in these studies , in particular , from salo et al.s ( 2001 ) @xmath0-body simulations , which treated particles of radius @xmath25 cm , undergoing collisions according to the bridges et al .",
    "( 1984 ) piecewise power law at a radius of @xmath26 km .",
    "full self - gravity was not included in the simulations , but its compression of the disk thickness was mimicked by increasing the vertical epicyclic frequency of the particles @xmath27 ( an idea pioneered by wisdom and tremaine 1988 ) . in table 1 we reproduce some of the data of these runs for different optical depth @xmath28 and with a vertical frequency enhancement of @xmath29 .",
    "these values will serve us only as a guide .",
    "the viscous parameters are closely tied to the kinetic parameters of a particular simulation ( such as particle size , elasticity law ) but their complete functional dependence is far from understood . on the other hand ,",
    "the kinetic parameters of a real particulate ring are not yet fully constrained .",
    "thus we let @xmath18 , @xmath19 and especially @xmath20 take a variety of values .",
    "the @xmath20 parameter is the quantity most sensitive to the background optical depth , as we can see from table 1 , and also to self - gravity . with respect to the last point , schmidt and salo ( 2003 )",
    "have published another set of parameter values from a simulation in which @xmath30 , not 3.6 , and they find that @xmath20 takes significantly smaller values in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "the simplifying assumption of a newtonian stress may require us to vary @xmath20 ; and indeed , schmidt and salo ( 2003 ) inflate @xmath20 by up to @xmath31 in order to obtain agreement in their weakly nonlinear analysis .",
    "finally , in a real disk , the existence of gravitational wakes ( screened out by the @xmath0-body simulations we mention ) will militate against the development of the overstable modes , meaning that @xmath20 may take a smaller ` effective ' value .",
    "the actual situation , of course , is probably more complicated , not least by the additional effects of nonlocal ` gravitational viscosity ' ( daisaka et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "armed with the linear stability results , we return to the question posed earlier : what role does this family of ` fixed points ' play in the general dynamics of an overstable disk ?",
    "the simplest outcome would be for an overstable disk to migrate from the homogeneous state to the shortest stable wavetrain solution ( with @xmath32 ) ; but this is far from guaranteed .",
    "the dynamics is likely to be more complicated , with the system flirting with a number of stable nonlinear solutions and thus exhibiting irregular time and space dependent variations . in this section",
    "we explore this behaviour with some schematic ideas and analogies .",
    "we will not bury ourselves in technical details ; this we leave for later , when we have a more complete set of numerical results at hand .",
    "first , we offer an explanation of the cascade of power to longer lengths that has been observed in nonlinear hydrodynamical and @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the analysis is framed in the language of dynamical systems theory and though ` hand - wavey ' should be straightforward to check numerically .",
    "next we examine the nonlinear interactions between linearly stable wavetrains of different wavelength , by computing slow variations in the wavetrains phase .",
    "it can be shown that the disk supports modulational ` shock ' and ` source ' structures , whereby the wavenumber and/or amplitude of a wavetrain undergoes a discontinuity .",
    "lastly , we draw analogies between a viscously overstable disk and the dynamics of the complex ginzburg - landau equation , and subsequently make a few additional predictions about the likely nonlinear behaviours associated with overstable disks .      in fig .",
    "7 we have drawn a schematic diagram of the state space of the overstable disk .",
    "the state space is infinite - dimensional , and , needless to say , somewhat difficult to visualise , but our crude two - dimensional projection raises a few interesting points and predictions .",
    "this representation of the dynamics treats the time - evolution of the state vector @xmath33 as a trajectory , tracing the smooth transition of the system from one state to another .",
    "equilibria appear as invariant fixed points : trajectories that begin there stay there , and their linear stability decides if trajectories that pass infinitesimally close fall into the fixed point or are repelled .",
    "the state of homogeneous keplerian shear is such a fixed point , and when it is overstable it behaves like a saddle .",
    "nearby trajectories will be deflected away from the point along those directions associated with the overstability modes .",
    "simultaneously , the same trajectories will be drawn towards the fixed point along those directions associated with the stable modes .",
    "a nonlinear wavetrain solution should appear as a periodic orbit , but for clarity we represent it as a fixed point in fig .  7 ; our argument is unchanged .",
    "the entire family of these nonlinear wave solutions plots out a semi - infinite , one - dimensional curve in the state space , which we parametrise by @xmath1 , the wavelength .",
    "the foot of this curve is the homogeneous state . in fig .",
    "7 the thick curve represents this continuous family of solutions , and the thinner arrowed curves represent possible trajectories of the system .",
    "waves are unstable if @xmath34 , where @xmath2 is some critical wavelength , while longer waves are stable , and like the overstable homogeneous state , the unstable wave solutions are saddles , each possessing a slow overstable manifold and a fast stable manifold .",
    "trajectories near the unstable segment of the curve of fixed points will be drawn towards the curve along the nearest stable manifold ; at the same time trajectories are directed ` up ' the curve by the overstable manifold . because the time - scale of the attraction is faster than that of repulsion ,",
    "trajectories will be bunched , or ` focused ' , about the curve of fixed points even as they travel up it .",
    "close to the branch of invariant fixed points this migration may be facilitated by the the linear ` translation mode ' with @xmath35 and eigenvalue @xmath36 ( see next subsection ) .",
    "thus the thick curve in fig .",
    "7 is a one - dimensional ` spine ' around which collects a nest of state - space trajectories .",
    "such behaviour is typical of dissipative systems , in which the long time dynamics is governed by a lower dimensional subset of the state space ( e.g. robinson 2001 ) .",
    "the upward drift will end , or at least change qualitatively , once a trajectory reaches the vicinity of the first stable fixed point . because larger @xmath1 fixed points are , necessarily , associated with longer wavelengths this upward migration should coincide with the movement of power to longer and longer scales .",
    "it is not immediately obvious what happens once a trajectory nears the first stable fixed point , nor how a trajectory behaves if it begins near the stable portion of the solution branch .",
    "the simplest outcome is for the system to settle on the first stable fixed point available ( @xmath2 for example ) , but this is far from assured .",
    "the basin of attraction of a stable fixed point may be very small , and we expect this to be the case for most parameters .",
    "it is more likely that the system will ` wander around ' the set of stable solutions , yet never fall upon any particular one .",
    "physically this ` wandering ' will appear as temporal and spatial modulations upon a bed of nonlinear waves , with the modulations manifesting on lengthscales longer than that of the underlying wavetrains .",
    "it is not clear which set of @xmath1 the system will select for the underlying waves , or whether this set gradually changes ( perhaps growing larger and larger with time ) .",
    "moreover , the situation may be complicated by a chaotic attractor ( as can be the case in the complex ginzburg - landau equation ) . that said , it is plausible that small initial conditions will yield a band of saturated wavelengths near @xmath2 .",
    "these conjectures are straightforward to check with numerical simulations , and we are currently undertaking this work . the only published simulation , that of schmit and tscharnuter ( 1999 ) , exhibited an upward cascade which in the nonself - gravitating case had not yet halted after @xmath37 orbits . by that stage",
    "most power was situated on a scale of some @xmath38 . according to the linear stability calculations of the previous section , using the same parameters as schmit and tscharnuter",
    ", we find @xmath39 ; so the simulation definitely passed the critical wavelength of the linear analysis .",
    "recall , however , that these simulations do not support global nonlinear wavetrain solutions on account of the boundary conditions and this negates much of the interpretation of this section . in their simulations , trains of travelling waves can emerge locally but given sufficient time ( and 10,000 orbits is more than enough ) these pulses will traverse the domain , encounter the boundaries , and reflect backwards and interfere with themselves .",
    "such nonlinear interactions are not captured in our model and perhaps induce an injection of power to longer scales than what we would expect .",
    "finally , one should note that in our interpretation the halting of the upward cascade does not require self - gravity , which is an effect schmit and tscharnuter emphasise . in their simulations its inclusion halts the upward cascade .",
    "but it is probable that the physical mechanism is different to that we have sketched .",
    "this and the next section ascertains the basic nonlinear dynamics of wavetrain modulations .",
    "this will give us some handle on the behaviour of the system once it nears the set of stable fixed points described in fig .",
    "the problem is a difficult one , and not generally amenable to analytic techniques .",
    "that said , a useful result can be derived if it is assumed that the modulations in question vary slowly in time and space .",
    "when this is the case , the phase perturbations are governed by the burgers equation , which in turn suggests that the radial domain may fracture into regions ( ` cells ' ) of different wavenumber bounded by two kinds of interface : ` weak shocks ' and ` weak sources ' , where the phase undergoes rapid change .",
    "the actual dynamics is perhaps even more complicated than this ideal picture but it remains a useful paradigm to understand the larger - scale irregular variations observed .",
    "it is also worth remarking that the theory is akin to the attractive idea proposed by tremaine ( araki and tremaine 1986 , tremaine 2003 ) whereby disk structure corresponds to ` jams '  the key difference is that in the tremaine model the jams correspond to discontinuities in shear , and in our model the jams correspond to discontinuities in the wavenumber of background waves .",
    "we now very briefly describe the derivation of the burgers equation .",
    "the proof is lengthy and tedious so more details can be found in appendix b. it is essentially a multiple - scales analysis which applies the methodology of howard and kopell ( 1977 ) and doelman et al .",

    "we represent it by the vector @xmath42 , where we have made the dependence of @xmath43 on wavenumber @xmath40 explicit in contrast to section 4 .",
    "the wavetrain is assumed stable ; therefore , associated with it are a set of decaying linear modes possessing negative growth rates .",
    "of these we select the modulational viscous instability mode and denote its growth rate by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is its wavenumber . from section 5 and eq .",
    ", this mode always decays as @xmath46 .",
    "slowly varying modulations of @xmath43 are sought .",
    "first we establish the long length and time scales characteristic of this modulation . for a small dimensionless parameter @xmath47 , define new ( slow ) variables @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the group velocity of the underlying wavetrain : @xmath50 note that we have chosen a spatial frame moving with the group velocity .",
    "wavetrain modulations travel at @xmath49 , not the phase velocity @xmath51 .",
    "next a perturbation of the wavetrains phase is introduced , @xmath52 .",
    "the associated variation in wavenumber is @xmath53 .",

    "the ansatz is substituted into  and these equations are expanded in powers of the small parameter @xmath58 . at leading order @xmath59 the balance becomes the nonlinear eigenproblem for the underlying wavetrain profile , eqs . at the next order @xmath60 the balance is a simple identity : the first @xmath40 derivative of the leading order equations . at order @xmath61",
    "we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the linear operator introduced in section 5 , the @xmath64 and @xmath65 are vectors that depend only on the underlying wavetrain and so depend only on @xmath40 and @xmath66 .",

    "must lie in the range of @xmath63 ( the fredholm alternative ) .",
    "this can be assured if the inner product of the right side with the adjoint solution of @xmath63 is zero .",
    "after some laborious manipulation , the condition is equivalent to the burgers equation , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the wavenumber modulation , and @xmath69 the ` phase diffusion coefficient ' is @xmath70 and is associated with the decaying modulational viscous instability . localised disturbances which ` bunch up ' the crests of wavetrains will relax according to this mode .",

    "can partition the domain into distinct regions inhabited by wavetrains of different @xmath40 ( aranson and kramer 2002 , doelman et al .",
    "figure 8 roughly sketches a portion of a domain so decomposed .",
    "similar phenomena should emerge in overstable disks , and it is possible that observed radial structure on intermediate scales in saturn s rings corresponds to the cellular patterns constructed from such wave defects .",
    "shock and souce interfaces will possess their own slow dynamics which compels them to drift relative to each other and undergo various kinds of interactions .",
    "the former motions may be represented by a simple one - dimensional ` cellular ' dynamical system that evolves the interfaces according to a set of ordinary differential equations ( elphick et al .",
    "1990 , ei 2002 , doelman et al .",
    "each interface is treated as a particle that weakly interacts with its neighbours via a ` potential ' and thus the model bears a similarity to a one - dimensional @xmath0-body problem .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to produce analytic estimates for the characteristic lengthscales of the cellular structures so formed .",
    "thus comparison with cassini data must wait . in any case",
    ", the model assumes only weak interactions between the interfaces , but full numerical simulations of the complex ginzburg - landau equation typically exhibit more complicated behaviour ( popp et al .",
    "1993 , chat 1994 ) .",
    "we briefly survey these phenomena in the next subsection .",
    "the complex ginzburg - landau equation in an extended domain boasts a substantial literature , equal to the diverse behaviour it exhibits .",
    "this body of work may guide the interpretation of future nonlinear simulations of the overstability .",
    "the complex ginzburg - landau system crystallises the essential dynamics of general nonlinear wave phenomenon in a broad range of physical situations ( aranson and kramer 2002 ) and which we expect nonlinear waves in planetary rings to share .",
    "the one - dimensional version of the equation reads @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a complex function and @xmath87 denotes the linear dispersion and @xmath88 nonlinear dispersion .",
    "the function @xmath86 typically represents the complex amplitude of some wave phenomenon , and is not the same as the phase modulation @xmath57 which we studied earlier  the latter , though , can be derived from @xmath86 .",
    "the equation gives rise to steady , nonlinear wavetrains , various wave instabilities , and ` defects ' ( such as source and shock structures ) that can ` glue ' together different wavetrains , in addition to different types of spatio - temporal chaos ( aranson and kramer 2002 ) .",
    "of the various regimes exhibited , behaviour associated with the so - called ` intermittency regime ' is of most interest . here",
    "the state space admits not only stable nonlinear wavetrain solutions but also a ` defect - turbulent attractor ' ( chat 1994 ) .",
    "the role of the latter is to govern the irregular dynamics of the shocks and sources that separate the different regions of stable travelling waves .",
    "a number of studies have explored the rich and chaotic dynamics of the interfaces ( popp et al .",
    "1993 , chat 1994 , ipsen and hecke 2001 ) : for instance , source and shock structures may wander around the domain , annihilate each other , and give birth to new shock and source pairs . the long - time outcome is also variable , and depends closely on the parameters . for certain choices of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the final state may be ` glassy ' ( a static arrangement of defects ) , the defects may evaporate altogether , or the birth and annihilation process continues indefinitely .",
    "another interesting regime is that of ` phase chaos ' in which the wavenumber of the nonlinear wavetrains undergo turbulent fluctuations .",
    "all or some of this behaviour we expect to carry over to the dynamics of the overstable disk . at the very least , the complex ginzburg - landau equation provides a template with which to interpret simulations of overstable disks and the iss observations of irregular structure in the b - ring .",
    "this paper has investigated the dynamics of an overstable fluid disk by exploiting the properties of its nonlinear invariant solutions .",
    "these structures manifest as axisymmetric uniform travelling wavetrains and form a continuous family of solutions parametrised by their wavelength @xmath1 . in section 4 and appendix a we computed the members of this family and outlined their physical characteristics . in particular , we find that inertial forces dominate their leading order force balance , and so the fluid undergoes approximately epicyclic motion .",
    "the wave amplitudes , on the other hand , are determined from an energy balance that counterpoises linear viscous overstability and viscous dissipation . in section 5 the wavetrains stability to small perturbations",
    "is inspected .",
    "it turns out that only solutions with wavelengths above a critical value @xmath2 are linearly stable . if the viscous parameters take values associated with saturn s b - ring , @xmath89 . finally , in section 6 we speculate on the role of the nonlinear wavetrains in the general dynamics , arguing that the system will linger ` near ' the branch of linearly stable invariant solutions .",
    "physically , this phase - space behaviour will translate to a bed of nonlinear waves suffering large - scale modulations or defects , the latter partitioning the domain into a cellular grid of wavetrains of different @xmath1 .",
    "our basic hypothesis is that quasi - periodic microstructure on scales of order @xmath25 m revealed by the uvis and rss correspond to the underlying bed of nonlinear waves .",
    "meanwhile , irregular structure on larger scales , of 500 m to 10 km may be a manifestation of the wavetrains spatio - temporal modulations , arising as the system flirts with a number of stable wavetrain solutions but is unable to settle on any .",
    "the individual waves are beneath the iss cameras resolution , but larger - scale variations in their amplitude and wavelength should give rise to different optical properties which the cameras can register . in order to fully establish the latter point , however , the optical properties of the nonlinear waves need to be understood .",
    "the dynamical and photometric modelling techniques that have been developed to understand the observational properties of gravitational wakes could be applied to this end ( french et al .",
    "2007 , colwell et al .  2007 ) .",
    "this study has adopted some rather strong modelling assumptions and neglected some important physics .",
    "the issue requiring the most urgent attention is self - gravity , as it will certainly play a role in the formation and stability of the nonlinear waves studied .",
    "its effects we examine in a following paper .",
    "the 1d isothermal fluid model we have employed is simple , but we doubt that the basic physics it has revealed is an artefact of its simplicity .",
    "that said , on at least two counts it can be improved : first , its treatment of the viscous stress , and second , its neglect of vertical motion . the navier  stokes stress prescription is not ideal in a scenario of densely - packed and infrequently colliding particles , where the collisional stress dominates .",
    "a detailed kinetic treatment is perhaps the best way to capture the nonlinear dependence on strain associated with a collisional stress ( latter and ogilvie 2008 ) .",
    "vertical motions , such as ` breathing ' or ` splashing ' , certainly accompany both the linear modes of the viscous overstability and its nonlinear development ( salo et al .",
    "2001 , latter and ogilvie 2006b ) .",
    "the importance of this effect is difficult to judge ; and may only be resolved by 2d eigensolutions and simulations , both formidable tasks .",
    "lastly , we briefly sketch out future work .",
    "once the role of self - gravity on the nonlinear waves has been established , large - scale hydrodynamical simulations of an overstable ring must be undertaken to test our various conclusions .",
    "these should also address the influence of the boundary conditions , which will help us connect the work here to that of schmit and tscharnuter ( 1999 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the dense  gas kinetic equations may be simulated , using perhaps the continuum model derived by latter and ogilvie ( 2008 ) .",
    "these then could provide a more direct comparison with @xmath0-body simulations and possibly to the observations of finescale structure themselves .",
    "the authors thank the two reviewers , jrgen schmidt and frank spahn , for their careful and thorough reading of the manuscript .",

    "they derive their equations using methods of celestial mechanics but the outcome is similar . because they consider discrete streamlines rather than a continuous medium , they obtain coupled odes rather than pdes which means that density waves are not so clearly manifested in their approach .",
    "our analysis is intentionally restricted to axisymmetry and local geometry , which slightly clarifies matters and allows viscous overstability to take centre stage .",
    "the physics of self - gravity , nonaxisymmetry , and the gravitational influence of external moons may be included later .",
