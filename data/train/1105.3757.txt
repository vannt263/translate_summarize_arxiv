    "the study of disordered and frustrated systems is a current subject in statistical mechanics , and spin - glass models occupy a privileged place @xcite . at low temperatures and even in the ground state ( gs ) , these complex systems display the main characteristics which dominate its physical behavior .",
    "gs quantities such as the domain - walls energy , for example , are frequently calculated to determine if a finite critical temperature exists @xcite .",
    "the energy and entropy are other gs observables that give valuable information of these systems .",
    "the former can be calculated using different optimization techniques @xcite , among others , genetic algorithms @xcite , simulated annealing @xcite , multicanonical ensemble @xcite and parallel tempering @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as entropy calculations are more difficult to carry out , sophisticated algorithms have been designed to determine this quantity .",
    "for example , transfer matrix @xcite and ballistic - search @xcite methods .",
    "a more popular technique to calculate entropy is known as the _ thermodynamic integration method _ @xcite .",
    "this relies upon integration of the internal energy as function of temperature along a reversible path .",
    "initial point corresponds to an arbitrary but known _ reference state _ , while the final point corresponds to the state for which the entropy value is required . in the practice ,",
    "a problem to implement this technique is the necessity to calculate a suitable reference entropy at a not very high temperature .    in this work",
    "we use a parallel tempering algorithm to determine both the gs energy and , by means of the thermodynamic integration method , the gs entropy of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) edwards - anderson spin - glass model @xcite , a paradigmatic disordered and frustrated system . by considering different bond distributions ,",
    "the more efficient strategies to implement the thermodynamic integration method are determined in each case .",
    "these strategies are based on the construction of reference states by the _ method of high - temperature expansion_. we stress that , the main objective of this work , is to show that this implementation of the thermodynamic integration technique permits to obtain reliable values of the gs entropy for different disordered and frustrated models .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ modalg ] the edwards - anderson spin - glass model and the parallel tempering algorithm",
    "are presented .",
    "the thermodynamic integration method is described in section [ tim ] and also the construction of reference states is discussed . in section [ numres ] , we present our main results and the values of gs energy and entropy obtained by extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit from finite - lattice calculations .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section [ conc ] .",
    "we start by considering the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-dimensional edwards - anderson spin - glass model @xcite , @xmath1 where the sum runs over the nearest neighbors of a hypercubic lattice of linear dimension @xmath2 and the variables @xmath3 represent to @xmath4 ising spins .",
    "the coupling constants or bonds , @xmath5 , are independent random variables chosen from a given probability distribution . along this work ,",
    "all 2d samples ( particular realizations of bond disorder ) with a square geometry were generated with periodic - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we study the edwards - anderson model with different bond distributions .",
    "on one hand , we consider the typical continuous gaussian , @xmath6 and discrete bimodal , @xmath7 ,    \\label{distb}\\ ] ] distributions , for which the mean value is zero and the variance is one .",
    "these are the most popular bond distributions . to avoid confusions",
    ", we will denominate eag and eab to the versions of the edwards - anderson model where interactions are drawn from , respectively , equations ( [ distg ] ) and ( [ distb ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , we also study a continuous uniform distribution with zero - mean value and variance one , @xmath8 and a @xmath9-delta distribution , @xmath10 ,    \\label{distp}\\ ] ] which is a generalization of ( [ distb ] ) . here , @xmath11 is a function of @xmath12 chosen so that the mean value and the variance of @xmath5 to be zero and one , respectively . by direct integration",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath13 for @xmath14 both distributions ( [ distb ] ) and ( [ distp ] ) are equivalent . on the other hand , @xmath15 ( the maximum possible value of @xmath5 ) when @xmath16 and the equation ( [ distp ] ) tend to the uniform distribution ( [ distu ] ) .",
    "in addition , an asymmetric distribution @xcite , @xmath17 ,    \\label{dista}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a rational number , and an irrational distribution @xcite , @xmath19 ,    \\label{disti}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the golden ratio conjugate ( or silver ratio ) , were also considered .",
    "as before , we will denominate eau , eap , eaa and eai to , respectively , each one of these versions of the edwards - anderson model .    in order to simulate these models",
    ", we use a parallel tempering algorithm @xcite .",
    "it consists in making an ensemble of @xmath21 replicas of the system , each of which is at temperature @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the basic idea of this algorithm is to simulate independently each replica with a standard monte carlo dynamics , and to swap periodically the configurations of two randomly chosen replicas .",
    "the purpose of this swap is to try to avoid that replicas at low temperatures get stuck in local minima .",
    "thus the highest temperature , @xmath24 , is set in the high - temperature phase where relaxation time is expected to be very short and there exists only one minimum in the free energy landscape .",
    "the lowest temperature , @xmath25 , is set in the low - temperature phase .    in order to implement this algorithm",
    ", we choose equally spaced temperatures , i.e. @xmath26 . each replica is independently simulated by a single spin - flip dynamics where updates are attempted with a probability given by the metropolis rule @xcite . on the other hand , the trial exchange of two configurations @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( corresponding to the @xmath29-th and @xmath30-th replicas ) is attempted and accepted with probability @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 ( without loss of generality , we take the boltzmann s constant equal to one ) . a unit of time or parallel tempering step ( pts ) , consists of a number of @xmath34 elementary spin - flip attempts followed by only one swap attempt . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we restrict the replica exchange to the case @xmath35",
    ".    the parallel tempering algorithm can be used as a heuristic to obtain gs configurations @xcite . for this application",
    "it is not necessary to reach equilibrium , because only low - energy configurations are sought .",
    "then , we have used this algorithm to calculate the gs energy . as in reference @xcite , where only eab and eag models were studied ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath36 and the extreme temperatures as @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , the number of ptss used here for the models with discrete ( continuous ) bond distributions , are the same ones that were used in reference @xcite to calculate the gs energy of the eab ( eag ) model .    on the other hand , to calculate the gs entropy we have proceeded differently . after an appropriate number of pts",
    ", the parallel tempering algorithm allows to reach equilibrium and to calculate the mean energy at all temperatures . as we will see in the following section ,",
    "integrating this curve one can obtain a reliable value of the gs entropy .",
    "in the following , we briefly describe the thermodynamic integration method ( tim ) @xcite . given a model with a fixed number of entities ( spins ) @xmath39 , we can write the basic relationship @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the total internal energy and entropy , respectively . integrating this equation , the gs entropy of a sample @xmath43 is @xmath44 here , lower case letters denote quantities per spin and @xmath45 is the temperature of a reference state for which entropy is known .",
    "while the integral in the second term can be accurately estimated by a monte carlo simulation , appropriate reference states are difficult to find . however , for an ising spin system when @xmath46 , a trivial reference state with entropy @xmath47 is valid for any sample . in practice ,",
    "good results are obtained with equation ( [ refent1 ] ) if the energy is calculated for a great number of high temperatures @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the tim performance can be improved if a suitable reference entropy is determined at a not very high temperature .",
