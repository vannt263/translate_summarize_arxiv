    "the high interest arisen concerning the problem of magnetic flux depinning in type - ii superconductors is markedly associated with its relevance to technological and industrial applications achieving elevated transport currents with no discernible energy dissipation .",
    "thus , the distribution of vortices in a real type - ii superconductor is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic driving forces perpendicular to the flux lines , and forces pinning the vortices to material inhomogeneities ( lattice defects , impurities , and finite - size effects )  @xcite . per unit volume",
    ", this reads @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) .    on the other hand , it is well - known that various striking phenomena occur when a transport current is applied to a nonideal type - ii superconductor under the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field  @xcite . first , a remarkable enhancement of the critical current density has been observed in a wide number of conventional and high temperature superconducting systems  @xcite .",
    "second , an intriguing negative longitudinal electric field along the direction of the transport current has been also reported  @xcite .",
    "such a resistive structure in the longitudinal field geometry has been intuitively understood in terms of helical domains , closely connected to the force - free current parallel to flux - lines ( recall that the magnetic force per unit volume is given by @xmath3 )  @xcite .    nevertheless , although several facts suggest that the vortex lattice is arranged in a helical configuration , perhaps close to the force - free arrangement ( @xmath4 ) , the arising voltage can not be straightforwardly described as a critical flux - flow voltage if one is to be consistent with the experimental reports  @xcite . on the other hand , although several proposals have been done in terms of the crossing and recombination of adjacent nonparalell flux lines , the so - called flux line cutting phenomenon has been basically recognized as the physical mechanism by which the longitudinal voltage is produced  @xcite .",
    "outstandingly , remarkable numerical and conceptual difficulties related to the implementation of the above picture of the local dynamics for the transport current in realistic longitudinal geometries have lead to unfortunate omissions of the phenomenon in practical calculations related to the applications of type - ii materials .",
    "recently , we have shown that our general critical state theory ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is able to describe on a quantitative basis the anomalous features involved in the local electrodynamics of a current carrying superconducting sample subjected to variations of both longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in brief , our work is developed at a phenomenological level which allows to deal with 3d - magnetic field configurations and nontrivial constraint conditions defining anisotropy effects on the superconducting material law .",
    "we have introduced a geometrical description for the constraints on the critical current density in terms of a closed region @xmath5 , such that the physically admissible states are given by the condition @xmath6 . when the physical limitations concerning the microscopic phenomena of flux depinning and cutting are considered to be independent",
    ", the region @xmath5 becomes a cylinder , with a longitudinal rectangular section of size @xmath7 .",
    "this _ ansatz_@xcite can be identified with the so - called _ double critical state model _ in type - ii superconductivity .",
    "hereafter , a related anisotropy parameter , that we will name after _ bandwidth _ @xmath8 will be used .",
    "preliminar work on the intriguing effects associated to the longitudinal transport problem was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "supported by numerical simulations that cover an extensive set of experimental conditions , we put forward a much more complete physical scenario .",
    "thus , we will show that the striking existence of negative flow domains , local and global paramagnetic structures , emergence of peak - like structures in both the critical current density and the longitudinal magnetic moment , as well as the compression of the transport current in type - ii superconductors under parallel magnetic fields , are all predicted by our general critical state model .",
    "in addition , we shall introduce some ideas that could be applied for the determination of the flux cutting threshold from local measurements of the current density flowing along specific layers of the superconducting sample , as correlated to the behavior of the magnetic moment components .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section_2 ] , the physical background for the critical state concept in longitudinal geometries under applied 3d magnetic fields is introduced ( sec .",
    "[ subsection_2_1 ] ) . then , the underlying approximations and the variational statement for the longitudinal transport problem in superconducting slabs are both described in detail ( sec .  [ subsection_2_2 ] ) .",
    "this encloses the time - discretized description of the magnetic field penetration process , and the local dynamics of the transport current in an arbitrary magnetization process .",
    "the theory is then applied for a set of experimental configurations and a collection of material laws as regards the interplay of the flux deppining and cutting mechanisms ( section  [ section_3 ] ) . on the one hand , the infinite bandwidth model ( or t - state model ) with @xmath9",
    "is assumed ( sec .",
    "[ subsection_3_1 ] ) . as the necessity of including a model with a well defined value for the threshold @xmath10 will become apparent , in sections  [ subsection_3_2 ] and [ subsection_3_3 ] a more general description",
    "is presented as function of the anisotropy effects on the material law .",
    "these effects will be investigated in terms of the range of parameter values : @xmath11 .",
    "the procedure will reveal both local and global properties of the magnetic moment and the transport current flow indicating a possible reconstruction scheme of the underlying material law .",
    "[ section_4 ] is devoted to summarize the main findings of our work .",
    "[ section_2 ] this section is devoted to introduce the theoretical background that justifies our variational statement as an appropriate tool which allows to implement a wide class of material laws in the investigation of the electromagnetic response of superconducting samples subjected to 3d magnetic field configurations and transport currents .",
    "the characteristic mathematical equations for the critical state problem are introduced in terms of a variational statement that is applied within the infinite slab geometry .",
    "the relevance of the parallel and perpendicular critical current limitations will be demonstrated .",
    "[ subsection_2_1 ] the dynamics of the local magnetic field and transport current profiles in type - ii superconductors is commonly obtained within the critical state model framework . in the basic formulation ( bean s model ,  @xcite )",
    "one considers that the magnetic flux lines , when driven by a macroscopic current density , will either penetrate or exit across the superconducting surface . in more detail ,",
    "when the driving forces ( local value of @xmath12 ) overcome the pinning force in a local section of the superconducting sample , the system of vortices rearranges itself into a new metastable state such that the vortex lattice is pinned again when the equilibrium at the boundary is reestablished . notice that this physical mechanism relates to the component of @xmath13 perpendicular to @xmath14 .",
    "since the displacement of the flux - lines takes place with high associated resistivity , the system quickly adjusts itself to successive equilibrium states so as to avoid the high resistive losses . on the other hand ,",
    "reversible energy terms related to the equilibrium properties of the vortex lattice are usually neglected ( justified by the range of interest for the local magnetic fields @xmath15 ) , and the linear relation @xmath16 is assumed .    for the particular case that the transport current is applied along the direction of the vortex lattice , rotation of vortices is induced by the component of the current density parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "subsequent cross - joining and cutting will occur if the angle between neighboring vortices overcomes some critical value .",
    "thus , in general , for nontrivial configurations , and related to the threshold values for the current density that trigger the displacement of vortex lines in some sense , a critical state may be defined as a given configuration which is able to withstand a critical current defined by @xmath17 , as long as neither threshold ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) is exceeded  @xcite .",
    "one must mention that , data from a wide number of experiments have shown that in many cases @xmath0 and @xmath20 can be of the same order of magnitude  @xcite . then , in order to explain the accompanying phenomena , both thresholds have to be included in the theory . in these cases , the local current voltage characteristic , connecting the local electric field @xmath21 and current density @xmath22 , is strongly anisotropic with respect to the direction of the magnetic induction @xmath14 .",
    "this fact introduces strong difficulties when trying to find an analytical solution for the _ critical - state equation _ @xmath23 ( or 0 ) .",
    "our formulation can somehow _ bypass _ such difficulties by treating the electric field as a derived quantity that may be obtained _ a posteriori_.    thus , the critical - state equation can be posed in numerical terms , assuming an evolutionary discretization scheme .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath24 stands for the local magnetic field intensity at the time layer @xmath25 , and that the current density profiles relate to some _ magnetic diffusion _ process that takes place when the local conditions for the material law @xmath26 are violated .",

    "the initial condition fulfills ampere s law @xmath32 as well as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "one possibility for making the integration of this system affordable is to find an equivalent variational statement .",

    "we have introduced the lagrange multiplier , @xmath38 , which can basically identified with the electric field of the problem .",
    "the related lagrange density ( over whole space ) is @xmath39 as indicated above , minimization under the constraint @xmath40 ( ampre s law ) allows to reduce the number of variables in the statement of the problem , skipping the explicit inclusion of @xmath41 .    for practical purposes",

    "by contrast , for the bounded case , the magnetic anisotropy of the material law @xmath174 defines the maximal current density for the critical state regime . in other words , the maximal length of the vector @xmath22 within",

    "to the right , we show the variation of the perpendicular component @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the curves are labelled according to the perpendicular magnetic field component @xmath178.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=55.0% ]    recalling ref.@xcite , the maximal longitudinal transport current density corresponds to the optimal orientation in which the biggest distance within the superelliptic region is obtained , i.e. : @xmath179 note that his equation allows to obtain the maximum value expected for @xmath133 in terms of the actual critical state model in use .",
    "thus , for @xmath180 one gets @xmath181 , a value that can be checked in figs .",
    "[ fig_5 ] and [ fig_6 ] .",
    "complimentary to the field penetration profiles , fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] shows the dynamics of the main components of the current density along the central and external layers of the superconducting slab in the ct1 condition .",
    "once again , notice that the full penetration regime can be clearly distinguished from the partial penetration regime .    also , an interesting property to be noticed is that the value @xmath182 is independent of the applied magnetic field at least as regards the existence of the peak effect in the transport current density ( fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] ) .",
    "thus , the enhancement of the transport current density can be either accelerated or decelerated with the tilt of the applied magnetic field , but in general terms , its maximum directly relates to the limitation introduced by the cutting mechanism .",
    "physically , this means that the role played by the magnetic anisotropy of the material law may be characterized by the influence of the threshold cutting value on the enhancement of the critical current density .",
    "this point will be made clearer when material laws with different values of @xmath99 are considered .",
    "of the slab as a function of the applied magnetic field component @xmath118 for the ct1 model .",
    "the curves are labelled according to the perpendicular magnetic field component @xmath94 for each.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]      finally , notice that the limitation introduced by the flux cutting mechanism imposes a maximal compression of the current density within the sample . thus , the peak effects both for the transport current density @xmath133 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] ) and for the magnetic moment component @xmath160 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] ) are defined by the instant at which the maximal transport current density occurs .",
    "additionally , upon further increasing the longitudinal applied magnetic field component @xmath118 , the profile @xmath121 will be forced to decrease from the central sheet ( @xmath139 ) towards the external surface ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "this reversal generates a local distortion of the longitudinal current density @xmath133 in a bow tie shape ( see the middle row of figs .",
    "[ fig_5 ] and  [ fig_6 ] ) .",
    "likewise , as soon as the profile @xmath183 ) is reached , the magnetic moment @xmath160 starts decreasing ( fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] ) as one can see by comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig_7 ] and [ fig_8 ] .",
    "[ subsection_3_3 ]        the intrinsic interplay between the cutting and depinning mechanisms introduces difficulties when one tries to extract the threshold values for a typical experimental arrangement .",
    "nevertheless , as it was argued in the previous section , several fingerprints of the actual material law can be identified , i.e. : the longitudinal current density along the central and surface superconducting layers , and the behavior of the magnetic moment curves . in order to complement this scenario ,",
    "we have simulated three additional experiments , defined by the so - called ct2 , ct3 , and ct4 conditions , in which the threshold value of the cutting current density is varied relative to the depinning limit ( @xmath184 respectively ) .",
    "the behavior of the local electrodynamic quantities is displayed in terms of the aforementioned three stages . in order to allow comparison , the main features displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig_5 ] and [ fig_6 ] for the ct1 condition with @xmath106 and 10 , are also shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_9 ] and [ fig_10 ] under the conditions ct2 , ct3 and ct4 .",
    "several peculiarities are to be noted . to start with , the emergence of negative states for the transport current density close to the external surface of the superconducting sample will be more evident either when @xmath94 is reduced and/or the current density anisotropy factor @xmath99 is increased .          in order to confirm the above interpretation",
    ", we show the magnetic dynamics of the longitudinal current density @xmath133 , the cutting current component @xmath185 ( fig .  [ fig_11 ] ) for the conditions ct2 , ct3 , and ct4 . we have taken a wide set of values for the perpendicular field component ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "on the one hand , as regards the sample s surface , fig .",
    "[ fig_11 ] shows that the longitudinal current density @xmath148 does not display significative differences when one has @xmath186 ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] for @xmath187 ) .",
    "thus , the disappearance of the negative current flow along the external superconducting surface does not occur despite a very high applied magnetic field has been considered ( @xmath188 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is important to notice that the patterns of the parallel current density along the superconducting surface ( @xmath189 ) are almost indistinguishable as soon as the condition @xmath190 ( ct2 ) is reached ( upper half of fig .  [ fig_11 ] ) .",
    "this implies that for an accurate picture of the parallel critical current , surface properties do not provide a useful information .",
    "however , outstandingly , fig .",
    "[ fig_11 ] shows that the threshold value for the cutting current density can be estimated from the experimental measurement of the transport current density along the central sheet of the superconducting sample .",
    "notice further that , regardless of the experimental conditions ( @xmath94 , @xmath118 ) and also for different bandwidths @xmath99 no significant change occurs in the parallel current density around the central sheet of the sample ( lower half of fig .",
    "[ fig_11 ] ) .",
    "the peak effects observed both in the local transport current density @xmath150 ( lower half of fig .",
    "[ fig_11 ] ) , and on the global magnetic moment @xmath160 ( fig .  [ fig_12 ] ) , are predicted to appear subsequent to the maximal longitudinal transport current density @xmath191 ( eq .",
    "[ eq_19 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , one additional feature is to be noted : the interval between the instant at which the maximal transport current condition is reached ( @xmath192 ) , and the instant at which the slope of the magnetic moment @xmath160 changes sign , could be assumed as transient or stabilization period required for an accurate determination of the value @xmath95 when measurements are performed in terms of the applied longitudinal field @xmath126 .",
    "apparently , this transient increases with the value of the perpendicular field @xmath94 . from this point on , @xmath150 may be basically identified with @xmath193 .",
    "[ section_4 ] despite of extensive experimental and theoretical studies about the electrodynamic response of type - ii superconductors in longitudinal geometries , much uncertainties remain about the interaction between flux depinning and cutting mechanisms , and their influence in such striking observations as the appearance of negative transport current flow , the enhancement of the critical transport current density , and the observation of peak effects on the magnetization curves . in this article , and based on the application of our general critical state theory , we have reproduced theoretically the existence of negative flow domains , local and global paramagnetic structures , emergence of peak - like structures in the longitudinal magnetic moment , as well as the compression of the transport current density for a wide number of experimental conditions .",
    "the longitudinal transport problem in superconducting slab geometry has been studied as follows : we have considered a superconducting slab lying at the @xmath194 plane and subjected to a transport current density along the @xmath89 direction .",
    "the slab is assumed to be penetrated by a uniform vortex array along the @xmath195 direction , so that the local current density along the thickness of the sample is entirely governed by the depinning component @xmath196 , perpendicular to the local magnetic field .",
    "subsequently , a magnetic field source parallel to the transport current direction is switched on .",
    "then , the experimental conditions have been modulated through the value of the external magnetic field @xmath197 .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the transport current density is shown to rely on the interaction between the cutting and depinning mechanisms . moreover ,",
    "the intensity of the inherent effects has been shown to depend on the perpendicular component @xmath49 , being more prominent as this quantity is reduced . by means of our general critical state theory that allows to modulate the influence of the different physical effects ,",
    "we have been able to show that the peak structures observed in the magnetization curves and the patterns of the transport current along the central section of a superconducting sample are both directly associated with the local structure of the vortex lattice .",
    "such dependence may become more pronounced as the extrinsic pinning of the material is reduced , in favor of the flux cutting interactions .",
    "the same conclusion was pointed out from the experimental measurements of blamire et .",
    "al ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) for high critical temperature and conventional superconductors . by using a theory that depends on two parameters ( @xmath8 and @xmath60 ) accounting respectively for the intrinsic material anisotropy and for the smoothness of the @xmath198 law , here , we have quantitatively investigated the influence of the flux cutting mechanism .",
    "it has been done by comparing the so - called square model ( @xmath199 ) , the t - state model ( @xmath97 ) , and the double critical state conditions ct@xmath99 with @xmath98 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 , all of them with the _ smoothing _ index @xmath202 .    from our theoretical framework",
    "we obtain that the isotropic model ( circular region : @xmath203 ) does neither predict the appearance of negative current patterns nor the peak effects in the magnetic moment curves . however , as long as a clear distinction between the depinning and the cutting components of @xmath204 is allowed , several remarkable facts can be explained .",
    "going into detail , when the cutting threshold is high ( @xmath205 or @xmath206 ) the emergence of negative current patterns is ensured because unbounded parallel current density allows unconstrained rotations for the flux lines as the longitudinal magnetic field increases .",
    "thus , under a range of conditions , the peak effects in the magnetic moment and a modulation of the negative surface currents are predicted .",
    "concentrating on the local properties within the sample , a clear independence of the field penetration profiles relative to the anisotropy level of the material law has been obtained for the partial penetration regime . on the other hand , as soon as the full penetration state is reached , noticeable effects of the magnetic anisotropy law are predicted both within the central and external layers of the superconducting sample .",
    "thus , according to our results ( see fig.[fig_11 ] ) the _ elusive _ parallel critical current density parameter @xmath10 can be obtained from the local measurement of the transport current density along the central layer of the superconducting sample .",
