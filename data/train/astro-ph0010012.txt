    "the @xmath1 process had been suggested in the 1950s to account for the nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than fe @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-process path of neutron capture generally follows the valley of @xmath4 stability , however , for some values of neutron density and temperature , @xmath5 are open and nuclei outside the valley of stability can be produced .",
    "it can be shown that in equilibrium conditions the @xmath1-process distribution follows the rule @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the neutron capture cross section of the isotope @xmath8 and @xmath9 its abundance in number .",
    "the rule is valid locally , far from neutron magic nuclei which act as bottlenecks of the flux and produce discontinuities in the distribution .",
    "an important parameter is the neutron exposure , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the thermal velocity of the gas .",
    "the neutron exposure determines the final distribution of heavy elements ; for higher neutron exposures heavier elements are produced @xcite .",
    "the major astrophysical site for the @xmath1 process has been recognised to be the deep layers of agb stars , which are low to intermediate mass stars in a late phase of their evolution .",
    "these stars experience recurrent convective instabilities in the region between the h- and he - burning shells ( intershell ) as a consequence of thermonuclear runaways of the he - burning shell ( @xmath12 @xmath13 , tp ) . at the end of a tp",
    ", the convective envelope sinks into the intershell and dredges up material to the surface ( @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 , tdu ) .",
    "a large amount of @xmath17ne  is present in the convective tps as a product of the chain @xmath18n(@xmath19,@xmath20)@xmath21f(@xmath22)@xmath21o  ( @xmath19,@xmath20)@xmath17ne  starting on the abundant @xmath18n  from the h - burning ashes .",
    "however , the temperature in the tps of low mass stars ( @xmath23 @xmath24 ) is not high enough to significantly activate the @xmath17ne(@xmath19,n)@xmath25 mg  reaction .",
    "the @xmath2c  neutron source is activated at lower temperatures ( @xmath26 k ) , however , an amount of @xmath2c  higher than that present in the h - burning ashes is needed to reproduce the observed enhancements of heavy elements . to enable the formation of a region rich in @xmath2c , the @xmath2c  @xmath27 , some protons from the envelope",
    "must enter the @xmath3c - rich intershell .",
    "a favorable location for the occurrence of the mixing is the sharp h / he discontinuity which is left over after tdu ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , however , no standard stellar models have found the penetration of protons to occur .",
    "recently , models including time - dependent overshoot @xcite , motivated by hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g.@xcite ) , and models with rotation @xcite have been able to create a proton - rich layer at the top of the intershell , after the end of the tdu . after less than a few thousand years",
    "@xmath2c  and @xmath18n  are formed in the region . before the end of the interpulse period all @xmath2c  burns ( @xmath19,n ) and the region becomes enriched in @xmath1-processed material . at the end of the interpulse",
    "the pocket is engulfed by the following tp and is thus mixed with material from the previous tp and the ashes from the h - burning shell . inside the tp , if the temperature at the bottom of the shell reaches 2.5 @xmath28 k , the @xmath17ne(@xmath19,n)@xmath25 mg  reaction is marginally activated and a second neutron flux can occur . after the tp the @xmath1-process - rich material from the intershell is dredged up to the envelope by the following tdu .",
    "this cycle is repeated over all tps with tdu and the composition of the envelope throughout the agb phase is changed by tdu and mass loss effects .",
    "predictions from @xmath1-process models have to be compared with observational constraints from spectroscopical observations of chemically peculiar stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) and with laboratory measurements of isotopic anomalies in silicon carbide ( sic ) grains recovered from meteorites , and believed to be originated in agb stars @xcite .",
    "stellar models , together with galactic chemical evolution models , should also reproduce the solar distribution of @xmath1-process elements @xcite . for an extensive review on the @xmath1 process in agb stars",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 process has been computed making use of the torino @xmath1-process code ( tosp , @xcite ) . this post - processing code calculates neutron captures on all nuclei up to pb through the agb phase .",
    "since @xmath2c  burns in radiative conditions , the @xmath2c  pocket is simulated by specifying independent mass zones of varied extent and their @xmath2c  amounts .",
    "the same @xmath2c  pocket is adopted for all interpulse periods .",
    "reaction rates for neutron production have been taken from @xcite for the @xmath2c(@xmath19,n)@xmath29o  reaction , and from @xcite for the @xmath17ne(@xmath19,n)@xmath25 mg  reaction , excluding the contribution of the elusive resonance at 633 kev . in the temperature range of interest , from @xmath30",
    "k , this rate is within a few percent of the one adopted in the nacre compilation @xcite .",
    "neutron capture rates are updated to the latest estimates @xcite .",
    "the post - processing models have been generated for a star of 3 @xmath24  and solar metallicity with inputs such as temperatures , densities , extent of convective zones and composition of the intershell taken from three different stellar evolutionary codes : the italian frascati raphson newton evolutionary code ( franec , @xcite ) , the australian mount stromlo stellar structure program ( msssp , @xcite ) and the german evol code @xcite . since the codes are independent from one another , they contain several differences , e.g. with respect to the numerical treatment , opacities and nuclear reaction rates .",
    "the most important difference to be noted here , however , is the treatment of convective instabilities and the associated mixing . while the franec code uses the schwarzschild criterion to determine convective boundaries , the msssp code uses a special numerical scheme which may involve mixing of an additional stable mass shell during structure iterations .",
    "the evol code employs a time - dependent overshooting mechanism which leads to a deep penetration of the intershell convection zone into the c / o core during the tp ( _ intershell dredge up _ , idu ) , and to the formation of a @xmath2c  pocket over a range of @xmath31 @xmath24 .",
    "these effects depend on the value of the overshoot parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the amount of tdu increases when moving from the franec to the msssp to the evol code .    in order to study the neutron flux in the @xmath2c  pocket we have made use of a code specifically designed for light - element nucleosynthesis in agb stars : the monash stellar nucleosynthesis ( mosn ) code , which uses the outputs of the msssp code .",
    "the nuclear network contains 74 light element species , up to the iron group , and 506 reactions updated as in @xcite .",
    "neutron captures on the missing elements are modeled by a neutron sink and a fictional particle , @xmath33 , is added to count the number of neutron captures occurring beyond @xmath34ni by an invented decay , with @xmath35=1 s@xmath36 : @xmath34ni @xmath37 @xmath38ni + g. since the tosp code does not includes proton capture reactions , the mosn code has been useful in giving a good description of the neutron flux , particularly in regions of the pocket where the neutron poison reaction @xmath18n(n , p)@xmath18c and the consequent proton recycle effect is of importance .",
    "we experimented with the mosn code , artificially introducing some protons below the h / he discontinuity left by the tdu to form a @xmath2c  pocket .",
    "then we let all the @xmath2c  burn and checked the total neutron exposure . since the maximum mass - shell resolution in the region of the pocket at the end of the interpulse period with the mosn code is not smaller than @xmath39 @xmath24 , as shown in fig . 1",
    ", to perform each test we put a constant amount of protons , rather than a profile , over a mass of @xmath40 @xmath24 .    for the @xmath1-process calculations based on the franec and msssp stellar models we used the same @xmath2c  pocket profile as @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) , which has a total mass of @xmath41 @xmath24  and had been chosen in order to match observational constrains .",
    "the @xmath2c  pocket found self - consistently with the evol code and used in our calculation has been computed for the 5@xmath42 interpulse period with @xmath32=0.128 and extents over 1.7 @xmath43 @xmath24 . to compute the resulting neutron flux we performed the same tests with the mosn code , however ,",
    "this time we artificially introduced the @xmath3c , @xmath2c  and @xmath18n  found in the pocket with the evol code .",
    "we therefore specified the @xmath2c  profile in the tosp code to reproduce the @xmath44 calculated with mosn .",
    "c. squares , hexagons and triangles are results obtained for the interpulse periods following the 1@xmath45 , 10@xmath42 and 17@xmath42 tdu respectively .",

    "2 , as computed with the mosn code . the total neutron exposure profile obtained when all @xmath2c  has burnt is also plotted . since the @xmath18n(n , p)@xmath18c reaction has a relatively high cross section @xcite , nuclei of @xmath18n  are a strong neutron poison during the @xmath1 process . some of the protons produced make more @xmath2c  when recaptured by the @xmath3c  ( recycle effect ) , others destroy the @xmath2c  producing more @xmath18n .",
    "as a consequence , the total neutron exposure @xmath44 grows , together with the @xmath2c  profile , up to a maximum of 0.43 mbarn@xmath36 , and then decreases when the initial abundance of @xmath18n  nuclei is comparable or higher than that of @xmath2c  nuclei .",
    "this result confirms that the maximum value of @xmath44 in the pocket chosen by @xcite ( see their fig . 3 and 6 ) is typical for stars of solar metallicity when x(@xmath3c ) @xmath47 0.2 in the intershell .",
    "we also made some tests changing the initial amount of @xmath3c , and for different interpulse periods .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3 a nearly linear relationship exists between the final maximum value of @xmath44 in the pocket and the initial @xmath3c , because the latter determines the @xmath2c  and @xmath18n  profiles and how many protons will be recycled .",
    "we note that the @xmath3c  in the intershell varies from pulse to pulse .",
    "this linear relationship suffers from some uncertainties .",
    "while the temperature at the h / he interface at the end of tdu is almost constant ( @xmath48 k ) for different interpulse periods , the temperature gradient towards deeper layers is much steeper for advanced tdu .",
    "the temperature at which @xmath2c  and @xmath18n   are formed in our calculations , at a mass @xmath49 @xmath24  below the discontinuity , is @xmath47 1.5 , 2.2 and 2.5 @xmath50 k after the 1@xmath45 , the 10@xmath42 and the 17@xmath42 tdu respectively .",
    "the @xmath3c , @xmath2c  and @xmath18n  profiles can be slightly different and , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the @xmath51 versus @xmath3c  relationship shows some spread . the smaller the extent of the pocket , the less the change of temperature gradient will effect the results .",
    "future work includes more tests with the mosn code , and @xmath1-process calculations with the tosp code , using a different @xmath51 for different interpulse periods .",
    "as for the evol code , because of idu , the initial mass fraction of @xmath3c  is 0.48 , and the resulting abundance profiles produce a @xmath51 of 0.88 mbarn@xmath36 .",
    "the discrepancy with the maximum value of @xmath44 we found for the same initial x(@xmath3c ) with the test profiles , computed with the mosn code , is possibly due to a slightly lower temperature at which the pocket has been computed , because of the smaller extent in mass , and mostly to the different choice of the @xmath2c(p,@xmath20)@xmath18n  reaction rate . in the mosn computation",
    "the latest rate by @xcite has been adopted , rather than the previous @xcite , which is 30% slower .",
    "c  pocket for a typical interpulse period ( panel @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) and at the bottom of a typical tp ( panels @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "the zero points in time represent : in panels @xmath52 and @xmath53 the time from the start of the interpulse period ( about 10,000 yr ) when @xmath56 k ; in panels @xmath54 and @xmath55 the time when @xmath57 k. note the large differences in time scale , total @xmath44 and neutron - density peak between the two neutron bursts.,width=604,height=340 ]    to compare the neutron fluxes in the interpulse period and in the convective pulse , we plot in fig .",
    "4 the temperatures and neutron densities for the two neutron bursts , as computed by the tosp code on the basis of the three different stellar evolution calculations .",
    "this comparison is only of qualitative character because we did not match the same tp number , core mass and envelope mass simultaneously for the three codes .",
    "however , the main finding is that the features of @xmath2c  burning are fairly comparable in all cases ( left panels in fig .",
    "all @xmath2c  burns before the onset of the next tp because the temperature reaches @xmath58 k ( panel @xmath52 ) .",
    "this is a very typical situation , however , it has to be noted and taken into account in future work that this might not occur during the earliest interpulse periods ( see e.g. fig . 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "while the total neutron exposure is determined only by the initial amount of @xmath2c  in any radiative layer of the pocket , the maximum neutron density can vary ( panel @xmath53 ) .",
    "however , it is so low that no branchings are activated . in the temperature range of interest the @xmath2c(@xmath19,n)@xmath29o  rate we use",
    "is about 50@xmath5970% lower than the one adopted in @xcite , however , this should not make much difference in the overall result .",
    "if @xmath2c  burns faster the maximum neutron density will be higher , yet still unimportant . in the tps",
    ", the temperature profile has a narrow peak ( panel @xmath54 ) , and so has the neutron density ( panel @xmath55 ) .",
    "the neutron exposure is unimportant compared to that in the radiative layers , however , branching points are extremely sensitive to this neutron flux .",
    "main differences show up between the franec / msssp and the evol case . in the evol code , because of idu , the temperature , and consequently the neutron density , stay high for a longer time and branchings are more active .",
    "we computed @xmath1-process models with the tosp code over a total of 25 tps with tdu for franec , 18 for msssp and 13 for evol . in table 1 the results for the envelope enrichment of @xmath1-process elements are compared with spectroscopic observations of agb stars and their relatives .",
    "we consider the parameters ` ls ' , which is the average of light @xmath1-process elements ( y and zr ) and ` hs ' , which is the average of heavy @xmath1-process elements ( ba , la , nd and sm ) . the ratios of these parameters with fe , together with the ratios [ hs / ls ] and [ pb / ba ] are good indicators of the overall distribution of heavy elements , which is determined by the main neutron exposure from the @xmath2c  pocket .",
    "predictions are given for the last tp , initial values are solar ( i.e. zero ) . to compare with measurements in sic grains we consider three isotopic ratios : @xmath60ba/@xmath61ba , @xmath62sr/@xmath63sr and @xmath64zr/@xmath65zr .",
    "the first two involve @xmath60ba and @xmath62sr , which are neutron magic nuclei , and are thus sensitive to the neutron exposure in the @xmath2c  pocket , while the third ratio involves @xmath64zr , which is produced through a branching at @xmath66zr , thus it is sensitive to the neutron density in the tps .",
    "the ranges of prediction are given for the last phase of the evolution when the condition for sic grains to form , c / o@xmath671 , is satisfied in the envelope ( last 5 tps for the franec , 4 for msssp and 7 for evol ) .",

    "the neutron exposure in the pocket is higher and the production of the heavier @xmath1-process elements , pb and the magic @xmath60ba are favored .",
    "the @xmath1-process element enhancements with respect to fe , of about an order of magnitude in agb star envelopes , are reproduced by the models . however , due to the uncertainties of the spectroscopic measurements on the observational side , and of the @xmath2c  pocket on the theoretical side , we can not draw strong conclusions about which of the models match the observations better .",
