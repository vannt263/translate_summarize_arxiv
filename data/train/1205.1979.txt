    "quantum entanglement is a fascinating phenomenon , especially if it is observed at the macroscopic scale  @xcite .",
    "it emerges from the quantum superposition principle lying at the heart of quantum mechanics .",
    "if a two- or multimode superposition is highly populated , macroscopically entangled subsystems are created .",
    "a bipartite system maximally entangled in a given degree of freedom has two subsystems , for which the values of the degree of freedom are completely random but still perfectly correlated .",
    "importantly , macroscopic quantum correlations can be revealed only by accurate measurement outcomes and strategies  @xcite .",
    "entanglement is the basic resource for quantum information processing , quantum communication and other quantum technologies  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , there is an important need for efficient and reliable entanglement verification and quantification in various physical systems .",
    "this is done by the measurement of entanglement witnesses or measures  @xcite .",
    "while an entanglement witness only tells whether a system is entangled or not , an entanglement measure allows one to quantify the amount of entanglement .",
    "unfortunately , most of the entanglement measures are not _ operational _ , i.e.  are not directly measurable in experiment .",
    "an operational measure of entanglement has been proposed for continuous variables such as wave vector or frequency  @xcite , but it is absent for discrete variables of large dimension , e.g.  @xmath0 , such as photon number .",
    "the first condition for entanglement ( inseparability ) , the peres - horodecki criterion , has been formulated in terms of density matrices   and therefore was not operational . later , other conditions were formulated in terms of measurable quantities such as variances or uncertainties of  @xcite .",
    "a general method of finding inseparability criteria for bipartite continuous variable systems , deeply related to the peres - horodecki condition , was proposed in  @xcite and then amended in  @xcite .",
    "it contains a hierarchy of inequalities for the measurable moments of creation and annihilation operators and generalizes the previously obtained conditions  @xcite .",
    "recently , macroscopic states of light generated a lot of interest and posed important questions in the scientific community .",
    "a possibility of verifying macroscopic entanglement became intriguing and was widely discussed  @xcite . among macroscopic photonic states , two kinds of entangled states have been generated and reported : the micro - macro polarization singlet state , where a macroscopic qubit is entangled with a single photon  @xcite , and entangled bright squeezed vacuum ( bsv ) states , macroscopic analogs of two - photon polarization bell states  @xcite .",
    "an entanglement test with the micro - macro singlet state was performed @xcite , but later refuted @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in the case of macroscopic states , inefficient detection may falsely reveal entanglement in separable states @xcite and that it is incapable of grasping their quantum character @xcite .",
    "new criteria for the test were formulated @xcite , but not put in experiment .",
    "entanglement in bsv states is known as twin - beam multiphoton entanglement  @xcite and manifests itself in perfect polarization correlations between two macroscopically populated beams .",
    "macroscopic singlet polarization bell state  @xcite is formally equivalent to the singlet state of a large spin , with the spin value being hugely uncertain .",
    "an entanglement witness in the form of spin inequality for bsv was discussed @xcite .",
    "recently , the non - separability witness derived in ref .",
    "@xcite was tested in experiment  @xcite for this state .",
    "the form in which the non - separability witness was derived is inapplicable to the other three bsv states ( macroscopic triplet polarization bell states ) experimentally obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . experimental realization of entanglement measures , e.g.  the schmidt number or other measures based on the eigenvalues of the density operator , for entangled macroscopic states of light remains an open issue .    in this paper , we formulate feasible non - separability ( entanglement ) witnesses for the macroscopic triplet polarization bell states in the spirit of the duan criterion .",
    "their testing involves efficient photodetection and the measurement of the stokes operators variances .",
    "we also calculate measures of entanglement for these states such as the logarithmic negativity and the schmidt number as well as the operational measure @xmath1 introduced in ref .",
    "finally , we examine the dependence of the measure @xmath1 and its relation to the schmidt number on the experimental conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with introducing the basic properties of the bright squeezed vacuum in section  [ sec1 ] .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] is devoted to the derivation of the operational entanglement witnesses for the macroscopic triplet polarization bell states .",
    "next , in section  [ sec3 ] we discuss various entanglement measures : the schmidt number , the effective schmidt number , and the negativity . a possibility of their experimental verification",
    "is addressed .",
    "finally , we make the conclusions in section  [ concl ] .",
    "entangled four - mode bsv states of light are prepared in experiment by employing two two - mode bsv states  @xcite obtained via high - gain unseeded parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they were created by overlapping on a polarizing beam splitter two orthogonally polarized beams of frequency - nondegenerate squeezed vacuum .",
    "the generation process , depending on the experimental conditions , is described by one of the hamiltonians @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the coupling constant proportional to the pump field , the pdc crystal length , and the second - order nonlinearity of the crystal .",
    "the down - converted photons carry linear polarization h ( horizontal ) and v ( vertical ) and are emitted in two frequency modes described by the creation operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting states can be considered as macroscopic ( multiphoton ) generalizations of the two - photon polarization bell states , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the parametric gain coefficient .",
    "the above equation allows one to determine their schmidt decomposition . for the singlet state @xmath8",
    ", the decomposition is known  @xcite . for @xmath9",
    ", it has a similar form , so that both can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes a two - mode fock state with @xmath13 photons polarized horizontally and @xmath14 photons polarized vertically in beam @xmath15 ( similarly for beam @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is possible to factorize eq .",
    "( [ schmidt_s ] ) further into two independent schmidt decompositions , one of them involving modes @xmath17 and the other one , modes @xmath18",
    "@xcite , @xmath19 , can be easily written by recalling that they are obtained from @xmath20 by rotating the polarization . as a result",
    ", they will have the same form as the one for @xmath20 , but will be expressed in different polarization bases .",
    "for @xmath21 it will be the right and left ( @xmath22 ) circular polarization and for @xmath23 it will be the @xmath24 linear polarization basis .",
    "the key difference between the two- and the four - mode bsv concerns entanglement .",
    "the two - mode bsv involves only photon - number entanglement .",
    "namely , the photon number in the beam @xmath15 with a fixed polarization ( e.g.  @xmath25 ) is unknown , but it is always equal to the photon number in the beam @xmath16 having the orthogonal polarization ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this state is known to approximate the maximally entangled epr state in the high gain limit @xcite . in the coordinate representation in the limit",
    "@xmath27 the electric field quadratures become completely uncertain and @xmath28-correlated .",
    "four - mode bsv is a product of two such states and thus , it simply provides two copies of it .",
    "however , it also contains polarization entanglement between beams @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this polarization entanglement is probed through measuring the photon - number correlations present in the two - mode bsvs ( see eq .",
    "( [ schmidt_s ] ) ) .",
    "it is called twin - beam multiphoton entanglement  @xcite and is most easy to notice if e.g.  @xmath29 is re - written as a superposition @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an analog of a singlet state of two spin-@xmath32 particles .",
    "@xmath29 is invariant with respect to joint rotations of the polarization bases of both modes .",
    "polarization of each beam separately is undetermined , but the polarizations of the beams @xmath15 and @xmath16 are anti - correlated .",
    "the situation is similar for the triplet states .",
    "this explains why these states can be considered as macroscopic ( multiphoton ) generalizations of the two - photon polarization bell states .",
    "entanglement witnesses are sufficient conditions for entanglement .",
    "although sometimes being inconclusive , they are so far the only practical option for proving the entanglement of multidimensional systems .",
    "conclusive ( necessary and sufficient ) conditions of entanglement are formulated only for special classes of quantum systems .",
    "for instance , the peres - horodecki criterion   provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the entanglement of two- and three - dimensional systems .",
    "its continuous - variable counterpart , formulated by simon  @xcite , is in the general case also only a sufficient condition , but becomes necessary for gaussian states . in practice",
    ", continuous - variable entanglement is often witnessed using the duan criterion  @xcite , containing variances of sum and difference quadratures for the subsystems of a bipartite system .    in experiment ,",
    "the output states @xmath33 , @xmath34 are given by a compound beam , comprising two independent frequency modes .",
    "therefore , their stokes operators @xmath35 are given by the sum of _ partial _",
    "@xcite stokes operators for modes @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath36 with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and similarly for mode b.    the condition involving variances of the stokes operators , @xmath42 holds true for any separable state of subsystems @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "this fact allows to formulate an entanglement witness operator @xmath43 as usual , negative mean value of the witness indicates entanglement .",
    "it is worth noting that the sign of @xmath44 is invariant to the number of spatial and temporal modes because the overall state is a product @xmath45 of states for different modes that are pairwise entangled ( between modes @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) , so both the stokes variances and the mean photon number of the whole beam contain additive contributions of separate modes .",
    "however , multimode separable states do not necessarily have this property .",
    "therefore , the witness is valid for spatially and temporally multimode beams , under the assumption that separate modes are independent ( the overall state is a product ) @xcite .",
    "this property enabled its experimental testing  @xcite for the macroscopic bsv singlet state @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , the macroscopic polarization singlet bell state has completely suppressed noise in all stokes observables @xmath48  @xcite , hence @xmath49 .    at the same time , the witness  ( [ wit_sing ] ) will not be negative for the three triplet states @xmath20 , @xmath34 , since they have noise suppressed only in one stokes observable  @xcite .",
    "however , all states in eq .",
    "( [ state ] ) can be transformed into each other by local polarization transformations and thus , they contain the same amount of entanglement .",
    "based on @xmath50 , we further derive the witnesses applicable to the triplet states .",
    "the @xmath20 state and the singlet state are linked by a local unitary rotation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a unity operator acting on beam @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that the rotation @xmath55 transforms the hamiltonian @xmath56 into the hamiltonian @xmath57 . in experiment , this transformation is easily realized by means of a half - wave plate inserted into beam @xmath16 with the optic axis oriented vertically or horizontally .",
    "thus , the entanglement witness @xmath58 for @xmath20 equals @xmath59 , which yields @xmath60 of course , in theory the measurement of the witness @xmath58 for the state @xmath20 is equivalent to the measurement of the witness @xmath61 for the singlet state , @xmath62 .",
    "entanglement witnesses for the other two macroscopic polarization triplet bell states , @xmath34 , can be easily obtained by recalling that the triplet states are transformed into each other via global rotations in the stokes space . in particular , @xmath21 is obtained from @xmath20 by a @xmath63 rotation around the @xmath64 axis  @xcite .",
    "this rotation can be realized by a quarter - wave plate with the optic axis at angle @xmath65 inserted into both beams @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting witness can be obtained from  ( [ wit1 ] ) by changing variables @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69    finally , @xmath23 is obtained from @xmath20 by a @xmath63 rotation around the @xmath70 axis  @xcite",
    ". it can be realized by a @xmath63 rotator ( a quartz crystal or a faraday cell ) .",
    "the witness has the form @xmath71    indeed , the witnesses ( [ wit1]-[wit3 ] ) have negative mean values for the corresponding triplet states , because @xmath72 for state @xmath20 , @xmath73 for state @xmath21 , and @xmath74 for state @xmath23 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the conditions for entanglement given by witnesses ( [ wit_sing]-[wit3 ] ) look very similar to the duan condition as they contain the variances of sum and difference operators for subsystems @xmath75 and @xmath76 . at the same time",
    ", the relation between the stokes operators from ( [ wit_sing]-[wit3 ] ) and the quadrature operators from the duan condition is only known for the case of light with a bright polarized coherent component and not for our case .    in fig .",

    "it enables simultaneous measurement of various stokes observables for beams @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "-[wit3 ] ) . in each beam",
    ", there is a stokes measurement setup : pbs , polarizing beam splitter ; hwp , half - wave plate ; qwp , quarter - wave plate ; d , detector .",
    "the signals from the two detectors in each arm are subtracted to obtain the stokes observables.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the measurement should consist of three series . in each series , one of the variances entering eqs .",
    "( [ wit1]-[wit3 ] ) is measured .",
    "this implies certain positions of the wave plates in the stokes measurement setup . for @xmath81 measurement",
    ", both wave plates should have their optic axes horizontal .",
    "for @xmath64 measurement , the hwp should have the optic axis at @xmath82 and the qwp , at @xmath65 .",
    "finally , for @xmath70 measurement , the hwp should have the optic axis horizontal and the qwp , at @xmath65 .",
    "the variances should be calculated by averaging over a large number of pulses .",
    "one of the well - known entanglement measures is the number of nonzero schmidt coefficients @xmath83 in the schmidt decomposition  @xcite .",
    "it is called the schmidt rank or number . in case of a maximally entangled bipartite system with symmetrical subsystems , defined in the hilbert space @xmath84",
    ", all schmidt coefficients have to be equal and the schmidt number is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the dimensionality of the subsystem . in general , @xmath87 and",
    "a state is separable if @xmath88 . to quantify entanglement in systems with infinite dimensional hilbert space such as bsv ,",
    "for which @xmath89 , another measure is more appropriate , which we will further call the _ effective schmidt number_. it is defined as follows  @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a density operator and @xmath92 .",
    "this definition coincides with the original definition of @xmath93 in the following way . for a separable state @xmath94 . for a maximally",
    "entangled state with all schmidt coefficients equal and @xmath95 ( such a state does not exist because it is not normalizable ) we would obtain @xmath96 . otherwise , @xmath97 is finite even if the number of schmidt coefficients @xmath83 is infinite .",
    "the effective schmidt number for @xmath33 state is the product of the effective schmidt numbers for subsystems @xmath98 , @xmath99^{-1}$ ] , which yields @xmath100 . since all the macroscopic polarization bell states  ( [ state ] ) have the same form of the schmidt decomposition , the effective schmidt number for all of them is the same , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the photon population in each mode @xmath103 . for bright states",
    "@xmath104 and @xmath105 , hence the degree of polarization entanglement grows quadratically with the mean photon number .",
    "other widely used and easily calculated measures of entanglement are the negativity and the logarithmic negativity which gives an upper bound for distillable entanglement  @xcite . for a bipartite quantum state @xmath91",
    "they are defined as @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath108 denotes partial transposition with respect to one of the subsystems and @xmath109 is the trace norm of an operator @xmath110 .",
    "particularly useful is the fact that the trace norm is factorizable , @xmath111 , and that the logarithmic negativity is additive , i.e. ,  @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "since four - mode bsv is a product of two entangled bipartite subsystems as in  ( [ subsys ] ) , it is sufficient to determine the negativities of each of them , @xmath113 , separately . performing partial transpositions with respect to the subsystems @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively , we obtain @xmath116 ^ 2=\\text{e}^{2\\gamma}$ ] .",
    "thus , for the four - mode bsv , the negativity equals @xmath117 . for high gain , @xmath118 .",
    "again , the quadratic dependence of the degree of entanglement on the population is observed .",
    "we notice that @xmath119 .",
    "the logarithmic negativity takes the value @xmath120 . in comparison , for two - mode bsv",
    "it equals @xmath121  @xcite , which shows that bsv macroscopic bell states contain ( with respect to the logarithmic negativity ) twice more entanglement than the usual two - mode bsv .",
    "this is understandable : since four - mode bsv consists of two copies of entangled states , twice more entanglement can be distilled from it than from a single copy .",
    "both the schmidt number and the negativity are not operational quantifiers of entanglement as they can not be directly measured in experiment . for a bipartite system entangled in a continuous variable ,",
    "an operational measure was proposed  @xcite , called the fedorov ratio .",
    "it is defined in the spirit of the entropy of entanglement with the advantage of being directly measurable in experiment .",
    "further , we try to adapt this measure for characterizing bsv , entangled in the photon number , a variable that is discrete but can be viewed as pseudo - continuous when large numbers are involved .    consider a pure bipartite quantum system , entangled in a continuous variable @xmath122 , with the state vector @xmath123 the variable @xmath124 can be characterized by its marginal probability distribution @xmath125 , with the standard deviation @xmath126 , and the conditional probability distribution @xmath127 , evaluated for a certain value of @xmath128 , with the width @xmath129 .",
    "the effective schmidt number @xmath97 for the state @xmath130 is very well approximated by the ratio @xmath1  @xcite defined as @xmath131 of course , equivalently the variable @xmath128 may be involved in this definition , instead of @xmath124 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 , known as the fedorov ratio , can be easily obtained in experiment and is hence an _ operational measure of entanglement_. note however , that this measure is only defined for pure states , so to be operational stricto sensu it has to be supplemented with an experimental proof of the purity of the global state . the possibility to generalize",
    "the fedorov ratio to mixed states is an open question .",
    "for instance , it has been measured for the cases of wave vector  @xcite and frequency entanglement  @xcite . for gaussian states ,",
    "the fedorov ratio exactly coincides with the effective schmidt number  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the definition  ( [ r ] ) for the photon - number variable and its probability distributions in the following way : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the width of the marginal photon - number distribution in beam @xmath15 , while @xmath134 is the width of the photon - number distribution in beam @xmath15 under the condition that a certain photon number @xmath135 has been measured in beam @xmath16 .    similarly to the effective schmidt number ,",
    "the ratio @xmath136 for each of the macroscopic bell states is a product of the ratios @xmath137 and @xmath138 of its two subsystems .",
    "for instance , for the state @xmath33 , the states @xmath98 in ( [ subsys ] ) have the same fedorov ratios",
    ". they can be easily calculated by noticing that the marginal distribution @xmath139 is a geometric one , @xmath140 while the conditional distribution is given by the kronecker delta , @xmath141 these distributions are schematically shown in fig .  [ distributions ] .",

    "finally , the fedorov ratio for @xmath33 equals @xmath145 thus , in case of high population , the operational measure @xmath136 differs from the effective schmidt number @xmath97 by only a constant factor @xmath146 .",
    "the @xmath136 ratio for entangled bsv can be measured with the help of a setup shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the orientation of the hwp and qwp should be such that proper polarization bases are chosen in the arms @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",

    "their polarization correlations are probed through photon - number measurements in polarization modes .",
    "since the hilbert space of these states is complex  @xcite and infinite , it is interesting to understand and quantify the amount of their accessible entanglement for example , by comparison with finite - dimensional systems , where the notion of a maximally entangled state is well understood .",

    "this assumption is indeed necessary : consider the following multimode state with two photons on each side : @xmath190 for this state the witness ( [ wit_sing ] ) takes a negative value @xmath191 , while the subsystems @xmath75 and @xmath76 are separable . in the multimode case the stokes operators in ( [ stokes ] ) are given by the sum of stokes operators for all different subsystems ( @xmath192 and @xmath193 ) , and the violation of the witness only ensures that there is entanglement between some subsystems ."
