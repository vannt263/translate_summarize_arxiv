    "there are several ways to define the notion of a `` generic '' metric structure . in this article",
    "we compare the model theoretic and two topological approaches to this question .",
    "this work was motivated by anatoly vershik s results on genericity and randomness of the urysohn space among separable metric spaces , theorems 1 and 2 in @xcite .",
    "vershik considers the collection of all separable metric spaces as a topological space , let us call it @xmath0 .",
    "some elements of @xmath0 are ( isometric to ) the urysohn space .",
    "vershik shows that this set is @xmath1 dense in @xmath0 , which leads to the conclusion that the urysohn space is in a sense `` a generic '' separable metric space .",
    "then he shows that for any `` reasonable '' probability measure on @xmath0 , the collection of metric spaces isometric to the urysohn space is of measure @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the urysohn space is in a sense `` the random '' metric space .    in his talk at the workshop on the urysohn space at ben - gurion university ( may 2006 ) , vershik said that his results had been motivated by model theoretic properties of the ( countable ) random graph , and that the theorems in @xcite are in some sense the analogues of the appropriate facts in classical model theory , although the context is different : instead of countable structures one deals with topological spaces of cardinality the continuum .",
    "in this paper we aim to show that the analogy goes much farther .    indeed , _",
    "countable discrete _ structures are replaced in this context with _",
    "separable metric _ spaces , so classical model theory is not the appropriate general framework .",
    "we would like to convince the reader that there exists a natural generalization of _ discrete _ first order logic to the _ continuous _ context , in which vershik s results are the true analogues of classical facts , the urysohn space is an analogue of the random graph , and discrete countable models are no more than a particular case of separable continuous structures .",
    "so from our point of view , properties of the urysohn space discovered by vershik are much more than results inspired by certain similarities between this structure and the random graph ; in a sense , both of these are particular cases of the same model theoretic phenomenon , which we intend to describe here .    continuous first order logic , recently introduced by ita \" i ben - yaacov and the author in @xcite , allows one to study classes of metric spaces ( maybe equipped with continuous extra - structure , e.g. a collection of uniformly continuous functions from the spaces to @xmath3 ) from model theoretic point of view .",
    "once working in this context , many results in classical model theory generalize to analytic structures .",
    "this paper is devoted to the connection between model theory and descriptive set theory , which is very well - developed in the classical context , i.e. studying polish spaces of countable structures for a given countable signature , countable models of a countable universal theory , etc .",
    "we will refer the reader to the excellent expository paper by greg hjorth , @xcite .",
    "in addition to generalizing vershik s theorem to a broad collection of classes of metric structures , our work generalizes a few basic concepts and results from classical first order model theory to the continuous context and pushes out the boundaries of possible applications of continuous logic .",
    "so although we intentionally try to make the article accessible to non - logicians , it could also be of interest to model theorists .    working in the context of continuous first model theory",
    ", we adapt some basic facts and techniques from @xcite and show how one defines a polish topology on the space of e.g. all separable models of a certain universal continuous theory .",
    "having done that , we discuss three different notions of genericity of a structure .",
    "one is model theoretic , genericity of a model of a universal theory among its peers ) .",
    "the other two are topological , genericity of a structure as an element of the appropriate polish space in two different ways : in the sense of baire category theory and in the sense of measure theory .",
    "let us state things more precisely .",
    "let @xmath4 be a `` reasonable '' class of separable metric structures",
    ". in our context @xmath4 will normally be the class of all separable models of a certain universal continuous first order theory . from the model theoretic point of view ,",
    "a generic structure in @xmath4 is a structure in which `` anything that can happen '' in @xmath4 happens .",
    "such structures are called `` existentially closed '' for @xmath4 .",
    "we will give precise definitions later .",
    "on the other hand , one can consider @xmath4 as a polish space ( i.e. there is a natural topology on @xmath4 with respect to which @xmath4 is a complete separable metric space ) .",
    "one can call a structure `` generic '' for @xmath4 in topological sense if its isomorphism class is a `` big '' subset of @xmath4 .",
    "one natural notion of `` bigness '' in this context is @xmath1 dense .",
    "another one comes from measure theory : one can consider natural measures on the space @xmath4 and ask what are the sets of measure @xmath2 .    in this article",
    "we have several primary goals :    1 .",
    "introduce the general model theoretic framework and the relevant notion of genericity .",
    "2 .   construct the polish space of separable metric structures .",
    "3 .   connect the notions of genericity .",
    "more precisely , we explain how a model theoretic notion of genericity gives rise to @xmath1 dense sets in the appropriate polish space @xmath0 and sets of measure @xmath2 with respect to any `` reasonable '' probability measure on @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , this provides a powerful general technique for showing that certain structures are topologically generic and random ( as it allows us to use well - developed model theoretic tools for this purpose ) .",
    "4 .   conclude with some examples .",
    "in particular , we discuss model theory of urysohn space and show that our results generalize vershik s theorems on its `` topological '' genericity .",
    "the author thanks the anonymous referee for very helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "continuous first order logic was introduced in @xcite and developed further by ita ben - yaacov , alexander berenstein , c. ward henson and the author .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed exposition .",
    "we will now try to summarize some important basic notions , facts and notations .    just as in classical predicate logic ,",
    "one starts with a fixed _ signature ( vocabulary ) _ @xmath5 . in this paper",
    ", @xmath5 will be countable .",
    "a signature ( vocabulary ) is a collection of function symbols and predicate symbols as well as continuity moduli for all these symbols .",
    "there is a distinguished predicate symbol @xmath6 , which will correspond to the metric .",
    "given a vocabulary @xmath5 , one constructs the continuous _ language _ @xmath7 which corresponds to it , which consists of continuous first order @xmath5-_formulae_. as in classical first order logic ,",
    "formulae are constructed by induction using _ connectives _ and _ quantifiers_. any countable collection of continuous functions from @xmath8^k$ ] to @xmath8 $ ] ( for any @xmath9 ) which is dense in the set of all such continuous functions can be taken as the set of connectives .",
    "we will assume that the following functions are among our connectives :    1 .",
    "the _ constant function _",
    "@xmath10 for every @xmath11\\cap\\setq$ ] 2 .",
    "_ pointwise minimum _",
    "( @xmath8 ^ 2 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] ) 3 .",
    "_ pointwise maximum _",
    "( @xmath8 ^ 2 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] ) 4 .",
    "_ multiplication by _",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath12 $ ] , for every @xmath11\\cap\\setq$ ] ( @xmath8\\to [ 0,1]$ ] ) 5 .   _ negation _ , @xmath13 $ ] , ( @xmath8\\to [ 0,1]$ ] ) 6 .",
    "_ dotminus _ or _ implication _ : truncated ( at 0 ) minus @xmath14 $ ] ( @xmath8 ^ 2 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] ) 7 .",
    "truncated ( at 1 ) _ plus _ @xmath15 $ ] ( @xmath8 ^ 2 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] ) 8 .",
    "@xmath16 ( @xmath8 ^ 2 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] )    of course , some of the functions above can be defined using the others , but we are not looking for `` minimal '' systems of connectives here .    the continuous _ quantifiers _ are @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as in classical first order logic , we only allow quantification over elements .",
    "so the following are examples of formulae :    * @xmath6 * @xmath19 * @xmath20 * @xmath21    as usual , formulae with no `` free variables '' ( i.e. each variable is in a scope of one of the quantifiers ) are called _ sentences_. the first two formulae above are not sentences , while the last two are .",
    "an @xmath7-_pre - structure _ is a set @xmath22 equipped with _",
    "interpretations _ for all @xmath5-symbols such that @xmath23 is interpreted as a pseudometric , each predicate symbol is interpreted as a function from ( some power of ) @xmath22 to @xmath8 $ ] , each function symbol is interpreted as a function from ( some power of ) @xmath22 to @xmath22 , and all of them respect their continuity moduli with respect to @xmath23 . in other words :    * @xmath24 $ ] is a pseudometric * for every @xmath25-ary predicate symbol @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 $ ] uniformly continuous with respect to @xmath23 ( respecting the continuity modulus of @xmath26 dictated by @xmath5 ) * for every @xmath25-ary function symbol @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 uniformly continuous with respect to @xmath23 ( respecting the continuity modulus of @xmath28 dictated by @xmath5 )    a _ structure _ is a pre - structure in which @xmath23 is a complete metric .    see @xcite or @xcite for more details ( on e.g. continuity moduli ) .",
    "formal definitions of these notions are not important for us here ; but it is crucial that the interpretation of each predicate symbol and of each function symbol is uniformly continuous , and uniformly so in all @xmath7-structures ( this is what we need the continuity moduli for ) .",
    "uniform continuity allows us to take ultraproducts of @xmath7-structures and obtain e.g. compactness of first order continuous logic .",
    "note that given a structure @xmath22 , one can easily define ( by induction ) the @xmath22-value of @xmath30 for any sentence @xmath31 .",
    "we will denote this value by @xmath32 ( it is a real number in the interval @xmath8 $ ] ) .",
    "note also that there is no particular importance for the interval @xmath8 $ ] , but every predicate symbol must have bounded range ( again , so that ultraproducts will work ) , and by rescaling we may assume it is in fact always @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "a _ condition _ is a statement concerning the value of a sentence @xmath31 .",
    "for example , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are conditions ( where @xmath36 $ ] )",
    ". we will call conditions of the form @xmath33 , @xmath34 , etc _ closed conditions _ and those of the form @xmath35 , etc _ open conditions_.    note that as we will mostly work with conditions of the form @xmath37 and @xmath35 , the continuous quantifiers @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be viewed as analogues of the existential and the universal quantifiers respectively .",
    "it is clear what it means for a structure @xmath22 to _ satisfy _ a condition @xmath40 , and we write @xmath41 .",
    "if every structure which satisfies also satisfies , we say that _ follows _ from and write @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath43 is a collection of conditions and @xmath22 is a structure , we say that @xmath22 is a model for ( of ) @xmath43 if @xmath22 satisfies every condition in @xmath43 , and write @xmath44 .",
    "a _ theory _",
    "@xmath45 is a collection of _ closed _ conditions which is consistent ( i.e. there is a structure @xmath22 which satisfies all the conditions in @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "we will always assume that theories are closed under entailment , i.e. if @xmath47 and @xmath42 , then @xmath48 .",
    "we denote by @xmath49 the class of all models of @xmath45 .",
    "we encourage the reader to have a look at examples of continuous languages and theories presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we shall not discuss ultraproduct constructions in this paper .",
    "again , curious readers are referred to @xcite or @xcite .",
    "an important consequence is the _ compactness theorem _ for continuous logic , which will be useful for us :    ( compactness theorem ) let @xmath43 be a collection of _ closed _ conditions which is finitely satisfiable ( i.e. every finite subset of @xmath43 has a model ) .",
    "then @xmath43 has a model .",
    "let @xmath50 be @xmath7-structures .",
    "we say that @xmath22 is an _ elementary submodel _ of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) if for every @xmath7-sentence @xmath30 we have @xmath53 .",
    "we say that a theory @xmath45 is _ model complete _ if for every @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "most theories are not model complete ; we will discuss this notion more later .",
    "@xmath45 is model complete if ( but not only if ) it _ eliminates quantifiers _ ; see more in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "note that continuous first order logic is a natural generalization of classical first order logic .",
    "indeed , every classical first order theory can be viewed as a continuous theory in which the metric is discrete .",
    "let @xmath5 be a fixed countable continuous vocabulary .",
    "for simplicity we assume that @xmath5 is relational ( i.e. no function symbols ) .",
    "let @xmath7 be the corresponding ( countable ) continuous language .",
    "we denote the space of all @xmath7-continuous separable structures @xmath22 with a distinguished countable dense subset @xmath56 by @xmath0 .",

    "we can view @xmath0 as a subspace of @xmath65 via the following embedding @xmath66 :    @xmath67 such that @xmath68 is precisely @xmath69 on the dense subset @xmath70 of @xmath22 .",
    "note that the fact that @xmath60 is a pseudometric and all the rest of the predicates respect the appropriate continuity moduli with respect to it is a collection of closed conditions .",
    "the fact that @xmath60 is an actual metric can be expressed as a collection of open conditions .",
