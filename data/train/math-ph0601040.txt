    "magnetic monopoles , or the topological soliton solutions of yang - mills - higgs gauge theories in three space dimensions , have been objects of fascination for over a quarter of a century .",
    "bps monopoles in particular have been the focus of much research ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "these monopoles arise as a limit in which the higgs potential is removed and satisfy a first order bogomolny equation @xmath1 ( together with certain boundary conditions , the remnant of the higgs potential ) . here",
    "@xmath2 is the field strength associated to a gauge field @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the higgs field . these equations may be viewed as a dimensional reduction of the four dimensional self - dual equations upon setting all functions independent of @xmath5 and identifying @xmath6 .",
    "just as ward s twistor transform relates instanton solutions in @xmath7 to certain holomorphic vector bundles over the twistor space @xmath8 , hitchin showed @xcite that the dimensional reduction leading to bps monopoles could be made at the twistor level as well .",
    "mini - twistor space is a two dimensional complex manifold isomorphic to t@xmath9 , and bps monopoles may be identified with certain bundles over this space . in particular",
    "a curve @xmath10 t@xmath9 , the spectral curve , arises in this construction and , subject to certain nonsingularity conditions , hitchin was able to prove all monopoles could be obtained by this approach @xcite .",
    "nahm also gave a transform of the adhm instanton construction to produce bps monopoles @xcite .",
    "the resulting nahm s equations have lax form and the corresponding spectral curve is again @xmath11 .",
    "many striking results are now known , yet , disappointingly , explicit solutions are rather few .",
    "this paper is directed towards constructing new solutions .    in a seminal paper , ercolani and sinha",
    "@xcite sought to bring methods from integrable systems to bear upon the construction of solutions to nahm s equations for the gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "integrable structures have long been associated with the self - dual equations and bps monopoles : ercolani and sinha showed how one could solve ( a gauge transform of ) the nahm equations in terms of a baker - akhiezer function for the curve @xmath11 . while conceptually simple , the ercolani - sinha construction is remarkably challenging to implement , and they noted that although their  construction . here",
    "we follow the approach of ercolani - sinha for the particular case of charge 3 @xmath0 monopoles .",
    "an outline of our paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall aspects of the hitchin , nahm and ercolani - sinha constructions and then proceed to extend the latter in section 3 . here",
    "we shall present new formulae and clarify the appearance of constant gauge transformations in the ercolani - sinha construction .",
    "further we will highlight the ingredients needed to make effective the construction and show how these reduce to evaluating quantities intrinsic to the curve . as an illustration of our general theory we consider the charge 2 monopole in section 4 .",
    "key to expressing the baker - akhiezer function for a curve @xmath11 is determining riemann s theta function built from the period matrix of @xmath11 .",
    "the first hurdle in implementing the ercolani - sinha construction is to analytically determine the period matrix for @xmath11 and then understand the theta divisor . in section 5",
    "we will introduce a class of ( genus 4 ) curves for which we can do this .",
    "they are of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 are distinct complex numbers .",
    "( for appropriate @xmath13 this yields a charge 3 monopole . )",
    "this class of curves was studied by wellstein over one hundred years ago @xcite and more recently by matsumoto @xcite . here",
    "we will introduce our homology basis and define branch points in terms of @xmath15-constants following @xcite .",
    "corresponding to ( some of ) hitchin s nonsingularity conditions ercolani and sinha obtain restrictions on the allowed period matrices for the spectral curve .",
    "equivalent formulations of these conditions were given in @xcite .",
    "the ercolani - sinha conditions are transcendental constraints and to solve these is the next ( perhaps _ the _ ) major hurdle to overcome in the construction . in section 6",
    "we do this for our curves . at this stage",
    "we have replaced the constraints by relations between various hypergeometric integrals . to simplify matters for the present paper we next demand more symmetry and consider in section 7 the genus 4 curves @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a certain real parameter .",
    "this restriction has the effect of reducing the number of hypergeometric integrals to be calculated to two .",
    "interestingly the relations we demand of these integrals are assertions of ramanujan only recently proven .",
    "we will denote curves of the form ( [ bren03 ] ) as _ symmetric monopole _",
    "curves ( though in fact they may not satisfy all of hitchin s nonsingularity conditions ) .",
    "the tetrahedrally symmetric charge 3 monopole is of this form .",
    "the curve ( [ bren03 ] ) covers a hyperelliptic curve of genus two and two elliptic curves .",
    "we discuss these coverings . using weierstrass - poincar reduction theory we are able to express the theta function behaviour of these symmetric monopoles in terms of elliptic functions and fairly comprehensive results",
    "may be obtained .",
    "finally , in section 8 , we shall consider the curve ( [ bren03 ] ) associated with tetrahedrally symmetric 3-monopole when the above parameter @xmath18 .",
    "this genus 4 curve covers 4 elliptic curves and all entries to the period matrices are expressible in terms of elliptic moduli .",
    "the analytical means which we are using for our analysis involve thomae - type formulae , weierstrass - poincar reduction theory , multivariable hypergeometric function and higher hyperegeometric equalities of goursat .",
    "our conclusions in section 9 will highlight various of our results .",
    "in this section we shall recall various features of the spectral curve coming from hitchin s and nahm s construction and then describe the ercolan - sinha construction based on this curve .      using twistor methods",
    "hitchin @xcite has shown that each static @xmath0 yang - mills - higgs monopole in the bps limit with magnetic charge @xmath19 is equivalent to a spectral curve of a restricted form .",

    "although monopoles have been studied now for many years and from various perspectives , relatively few analytic solutions are known .",
    "this paper has sought to make effective the connection with integrable systems to construct such solutions .",
    "it is nevertheless only early steps upon this road .",
    "the paper had two thrusts : an examination of the general construction and then a focus on a ( new ) class of charge three monopoles . in our general considerations we gave a further constraint on the ercolani - sinha vector ( lemma [ ueventheta ] ) and presented a new solution to the matrix @xmath165 ( theorem [ ourq0 ] ) , from which the nahm data is reconstructed by solving a first order matrix differential equation .",
    "this latter step will be considered elsewhere .",
    "our construction of the matrix @xmath165 has been cast solely in terms of data built out of the spectral curve .",

    "our analysis clearly identifies each of the ingredients necessary for the construction of this matrix and we showed how the fundamental bi - differential may be used in calculating this .",
    "nearly all of the ingredients hinge on being able to integrate explicitly on the curve .    to apply our general construction beyond the known case of charge two we considered the restricted class of charge three monopoles ( [ welstein99 ] ) which includes the tetrahedrally symmetric monopole .",
    "this family of curves has many arithmetic properties that facilitates analytic integration .",
    "in particular the period matrix may be explicitly expressed in terms of just four integrals . using this",
    "we were able to explicitly solve the ercolani - sinha constraints that are equivalent to hitchin s transcendental condition ( a2 ) of the triviality of a certain line bundle over the spectral curve ( proposition [ ourh2 ] ) .",
    "our approach reduces the problem to that of determining certain rationality properties of the ( four ) relevant periods .",
    "( our result also admits another approach to seeking monopole curves : we may solve the ercolani - sinha constraints and then seek to impose hitchin s reality conditions on the resulting curves . results from this approach will be explored elsewhere . ) to proceed further in this rather uncharted territory we further restricted our attention to what we have referred to as ",
    "symmetric 3-monopoles \" whose spectral curve has the form ( [ bren03 ] ) .",
    "this reduced the required independent integrals from four to two , each of which were hypergeometric in form , and the rationality requirement is now for the ratio of these ( proposition [ propesnt ] ) .",
    "extensions of work by ramanujan mean this latter question may be replaced by number theory and of seeking solutions of various algebraic equations ( depending on the primes involved in the rational ratio ) .",
    "examples of such solutions were given ( again including the tetrahedral case ) .",
    "we further examined the symmetries and coverings of these symmetric curves and their relation to higher goursat hypergeometric identities .",
    "having at hand now many putative spectral curves we proceeded to evaluate the remaining integrals needed in our construction .",
    "remarkably we discovered that application of weierstrass reduction theory showed that the ercolani - sinha vector transformed to a universal form and that all of the theta function @xmath110-dependence for symmetric 3-monopoles was expressible in terms of elliptic functions ( theorems [ symwp],[symel ] ) .",
    "the final selection of permissible spectral curves at last reduced to the question of zeros of these elliptic functions .",
    "unfortunately , of the symmetric 3-monopoles we have examined only the tetrahedral monopole has the required zeros .",
    "further investigation is required to ascertain whether this is a general result .",
    "our final section then was devoted to the charge three tetrahedrally symmetric monopole .",
    "here we were able to substantially simplify known expressions for the period matrix of the spectral curve as well as prove a conjectured identity of earlier workers .",
    "again an explicit map was given and we have been able to reduce entirely to elliptic functions . the final comparison with the nahm data of @xcite requires the next stage of the reconstruction , solving for the matrix @xmath115 .",
    "this and other matters will be left for a subsequent work .",
    "this paper was conceived at the epsrc funded newton institute programme `` integrable systems '' in 2001 and had early encouragement from hermann flaschka and nick ercolani .",
    "the many technical hurdles encountered in this work meant growth has come in spurts rather than continuous progress and it has occupied our thoughts for much of this time .",
