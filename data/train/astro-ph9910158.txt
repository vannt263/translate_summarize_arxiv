    "many previous studies of samples of radio sources have required the use of redshift estimators for a significant fraction of the sample ( e.g. dunlop & peacock 1990 ) .",

    "it is now known that simple extrapolation of the 3c relation to higher redshifts and/or to fainter radio samples ( which contain fewer radio luminous sources at any given redshift ) leads to both large uncertainties in the estimated redshifts , and to systematic biases . for the sources in the 3c ,",
    "6c and 7c samples used in our study , the redshifts are almost exclusively spectroscopic . in the very few cases where we have been unable to secure spectroscopic redshifts we have estimated redshifts by obtaining multi - colour ( optical and near - infrared ) information and fitting spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with template galaxy spectra ( e.g. dunlop & peacock 1993 ; willott et al .  _ in prep _ ) .",
    "angular sizes of radio sources were measured by taking the sum of the separation from the core to each hotspot or , in the absence of a core , the hotspot - to - hotspot separation .",

    "7 shows that the greater the linear size of a radio source the steeper is its low frequency spectral index .",
    "this was the strongest correlation we found out of all of those we examined for the set of complete samples under study . we interpret this as being a consequence of adiabatic expansion losses and telling us that the magnetic fields decrease as the lobes expand , for the following reason .",
    "( we consider and reject other possibilities in blundell , rawlings & willott 1999 . ) for a fixed observing frequency @xmath14 , the relationship between the lorentz factor ( @xmath15 ) of the particles giving rise to that emission and the ambient magnetic field is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the charge on an electron and @xmath18 is its rest - mass .",
    "thus as the magnetic field decreases , higher-@xmath15 particles will be responsible for radiation at that fixed observing frequency .",
    "since for lobe emission the spectrum of the energy distribution of particles is steep and frequently curved these higher-@xmath15 particles will be from a steeper part of the energy distribution , and hence a higher rest - frame 151mhz spectral index will be observed .",

    "the @xmath4-@xmath13 plane shows that there is no strong correlation between the luminosities and linear sizes of radio sources in the combination of complete samples .",
    "given the sampling functions alluded to at the start of this paper which influence the nature of the objects which make it into our surveys , it should _ not _ be claimed that the absence of a correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath13 in any way might imply that for any given source as @xmath13 grows , @xmath4 will not evolve .",
    "we have formulated a model for evolving radio galaxies which reproduces the above dependencies , and others , and this is detailed in blundell , rawlings & willott ( 1999 ) .",
    "this model is the first model for radio galaxy evolution which incorporates the role played by the hotspot .",
    "this role has two aspects .",
    "_ first _ , the magnetic field of the hotspot causes significant radiative losses on synchrotron particles during their dwell - time in the hotspot , in the period of time before they are injected into the lobe .",
    "we were led to this as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : pa ] by our observation that the radio sources in our complete samples seemed to strongly indicate that the more luminous a radio - source was , the steeper its _ low - frequency spectrum _ was ( for example , when evaluated at rest - frame 151mhz ) .",
    "this rest - frame frequency regime is less affected by synchrotron and inverse compton losses than the ghz regime and thus more closely informs us on the energy distribution of particles _ as initially injected _ into the lobe of a radio - source .",
    "modelling a steeper spectrum in a more powerful source came naturally out of invoking stronger magnetic fields ( hence stronger radiative losses ) in sources with higher jet - powers . by equating the jet - thrust and the pressure in the compact hotspot , and invoking equipartition in the hotspot",
    ", we find that the magnetic energy density in the hotspot is proportional to the bulk kinetic power transported in the jet .",
    "_ second _ , as a plasma element expands out of a compact hotspot into a lobe whose pressure is considerably lower ( and continues to become lower as the radio lobe expands and gets older ) it suffers enhanced adiabatic expansion losses compared to the expansion losses suffered by that element of plasma once it continues to dwell in the lobe .",
    "this is consistent with observations of classical doubles which invariably show highly compact hotspots  embedded towards the outermost edges of the smooth , low surface - brightness , extended emission which comprises the lobe  albeit with a bewildering menagerie of shapes and structures ( leahy et al .",

    ", their scarcity in the local universe , together with the harsh reality of survey flux - limits means that very powerful sources with large linear sizes are rarely seen .",
    "this resolves the old problem first posed by baldwin in 1982 that there is a dearth of large _ and _ powerful classical doubles .",
    "this problem had been a puzzle : intuitively [ and as later modelled by falle ( 1991 ) ] the more powerful radio - sources were expected to expand faster than those with lower jet - powers , so the laws of probability alone suggest it should be easy to find large , powerful sources .",

    "in a recent letter to _ nature _ ( blundell & rawlings 1999a ) we demonstrated how declining luminosity tracks in combination with the consequences of applying a flux - limit at different redshifts would inevitably give rise to an effect which we termed the ` youth - redshift degeneracy ' : the fact that in a given flux - limited sample , those sources at higher redshift must be younger than their low redshift counterparts .",
    "this effect applies very strongly to powerful sources when the role of the hotspot is incorporated into the model @xmath4@xmath13 tracks , as described in  6 .",
    "the youth - redshift ( yz ) degeneracy means it is necessary to be careful about the correct interpretation of ` trends with redshift ' . in many cases",
    "it is wrong to attribute such trends to changes in _ cosmic epoch _ when the effects arise because of _ source age_. we consider briefly five such examples of effects which occur because the high redshift sources are young sources , and hence are being observed not long after the jet - triggering event ( which is possibly a galaxy - galaxy merger , sanders et al 1988 ) .",

    "barthel and miley ( 1988 ) had suggested that higher redshift environments are denser and more inhomogeneous than at low redshift since they found increased distortion in the structures of their high-@xmath1 sample of steep - spectrum quasars compared with their low-@xmath1 sample .",
    "sources which are younger may have the passage of their jets considerably more disrupted where there is a higher density and greater inhomogeneity in the ambient post - recent - merger environment .",

    "the higher density in this region will enhance the observed depolarisation .",

    "once there is a cessation of jet - power , this implies that the radio source luminosity will decrease into oblivion .",
    "what will govern this decline in luminosity ?",
    "the radio source will expand causing adiabatic losses in the ways described in  5.3 ( see also scheuer & williams 1968 ) , but the expansion of the plasma lobe can only occur on timescales consistent with the sound speed so this can not be a rapid process . a rapid decay time does however come from considering the brevity of the radiative lifetimes of the synchrotron emitting particles .    to radiate at rest - frame 5ghz in a magnetic field strength of 1nt , equation  [ eq : lorentz ] tells us that the required lorentz factor of the electron is given by @xmath37 .",
    "the radiative lifetimes of synchrotron emitting particles are often purported to be @xmath38 years , but such values overlook the fact that the lobe of a radio source is an evolving entity and the adiabatic expansion losses ( especially the decreasing magnetic field ) discussed earlier mean that particles with increasingly higher @xmath15 are required to produce the emission at the same chosen frequency as the source ages .",
    "for example , in the situation above , a @xmath37 particle will emit most of its radiation at 5ghz if the magnetic field strength is 1nt .",
    "if the field lowers adiabatically to 0.1nt then a particle whose lorentz factor is @xmath39 is required to produce the emission at the same ` observing frequency ' of 5 ghz . in a radio lobe , changes in the magnetic field go hand - in - hand with changes in the energies of the particles themselves since it is the expansion of the lobe which governs both .",
    "thus the particle now radiating in the lower @xmath40-field of 0.1nt at 5ghz with @xmath41 would , prior to the decrease in magnetic field strength , have had @xmath42 .",
    "the synchrotron cooling rate increases as @xmath43 , shortening the relevant radiative lifetimes further .",
    "we explore quantitatively the radiative lifetimes of synchrotron emitting particles in blundell & rawlings ( 1999b ) , and find that they appear to be substantially shorter than source ages ( see figure 1 of that paper ) .",
    "if we accept that the synchrotron radiative lifetimes are short then there is little difficulty explaining why synchrotron radiation in the ghz regime should cease on the same timescales . there would thus be no problem explaining the rarity of dead classical doubles .",
    "but this picture leaves us with a problem in explaining how many large linear - size , low - powered radio sources have lobes with synchrotron emission often all the way back to the core .",
    "these sources are almost certainly the oldest examples of classical doubles which we currently know of and at distances of many 100s kpc from the hotspot , synchrotron emission is seen from particles with a radiative lifetime substantially shorter than the age of the source .",
    "reconciliation of these has traditionally come from assuming a fast bulk backflow speed within the lobe which transports the relativistic particles away from the hotspot rather faster than the lobe itself advances away from the core .",
    "but this brings us to another problem with this standard picture : there must be a sink for all of this backflowing emission .",
    "as jenkins & scheuer ( 1976 ) first pointed out , if synchrotron losses play a major part in limiting lobe lengths , then lobes lengths ( and by extension backflow reservoirs ) should be longer and more extensive at low frequencies than at high frequencies .",
    "however , we do not find this to be the case .",

    "11 illustrating this , with images at ghz frequencies from the 3crr atlas web - site ( leahy , bridle & strom 1996 , http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/atlas ) shown for comparison .",
    "these images show how the fractional contribution of the hotspots changes as a function of frequency and especially that there is no hint of any backflow emanating from the oldest parts of the lobes : in all of the 3c sources we have observed to date there is no evidence for any extended structure which is not already seen at ghz frequencies .",
    "a full set of these images together with associated spectral index maps and analysis will be presented in kassim , perley & blundell ( in prep . ) .",
    "a rapid diffusion of the high lorentz factor particles would reconcile the rapid disappearance of classical doubles ( note that converting classical doubles into fris would be too slow a process to solve this problem ) and the presence of synchrotron emitting material in lobes so far separated from the hotspot that their radiative lifetimes are shorter than the hotspot - travel - time from their location .",
    "particle re - acceleration and inhomogeneous magnetic field strengths would only solve the latter , but not the former , problem . while it is clear that classical diffusion is too slow a process , other diffusion mechanisms which depend on the tangling scale and strength of magnetic fields within the lobes ( such as that discussed by duffy et al .",

    "* peter barthel : * another explanation for the @xmath4-@xmath19 correlation would be enhanced radiative efficiency in a hot confining medium ( x - ray halo ) such as is present around cygnus a and proposed to boost its radio luminosity ( barthel & arnaud , 1996 , mnras , 283 , l45 ) .",
    "cosmologically evolving halos ( gopal - krishna & wiita , 1991 , apj ) plus the bias would explain all the cosmological effects you attribute to youth .",
    "but , i do like your youth model  guess several mechanisms are at work ",
    "* katherine blundell : * it is true that a more dense confining medium results in a higher radio luminosity ( see fig.[fig : tracks ] , which shows how an order of magnitude increase in density will increase the radio luminosity by half an order of magnitude ) .",
    "it is not true that denser media will cause higher spectral indices to be observed , and especially not for low - frequency spectral indices .",
    "it is worth reminding ourselves that we are trying to explain an observed correlation of luminosity with _ low - frequency _ spectral - index .",
    "in fact the reverse effect will be important : for a more dense medium the expansion of the source is slower so the magnetic field does not fall off so quickly . in a _ higher _ magnetic field ,",
    "lower lorentz factor particles are responsible for the radiation at a fixed observing frequency . given the usual shape of energy distributions in these objects ( i.e.  steep curved spectra ) , lower lorentz factor particles will give rise to _ flatter _ not _ steeper _ spectra .",
    "thus this mechanism can not be responsible for the @xmath4@xmath19 correlation .",
    "* paul wiita : * some of the points you made concerning the youth - redshift degeneracy were made in a different context by gopal - krishna , myself and saripalli ( mnras , 1989 , 239 , 173 ) when we modelled the paucity of giant radio galaxies .",
    "* katherine blundell : * our recent study which led to the ` youth - redshift degeneracy ' has illustrated that in fact the inverse compton losses are not by any means the most important factor in causing the deficit of large linear - size radio galaxies .",
    "it is actually the drastic effects of a survey _ flux - limit _ together with luminosity tracks which decline because of adiabatic expansion losses which predominantly reduces the number of giant radio galaxies found in complete samples above @xmath44 .",
    "( it should be noted that giant radio galaxies out to @xmath45 have been found by cotter , rawlings & saunders 1996 . )",
    "inclusion of the role of the hotspot also enables us to explain not just the low - numbers of _ low_-powered large radio galaxies , but also the problem posed by baldwin ( 1982 ) that there is an _ absence _ of _ high_-power large size sources ."
