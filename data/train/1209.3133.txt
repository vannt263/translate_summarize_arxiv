    "during the last years , spatial localization of an atom using optical techniques has attracted extensive attention .",
    "the prototype of an all - optical measuring device is the heisenberg microscope @xcite .",
    "the resolving power of this particular experiment is limited by the optical wavelength if the heisenberg uncertainty relation is taken into account .",
    "further , in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case , optical methods for atom localization within the optical wavelength were developed using an internal structure of the atomic levels .",
    "schemes of subwavelength localization have been performed , using for example , the measurement either of the phase shift @xcite or of the atomic dipole @xcite after the passage of the atom through an off - resonant standing - wave field .",
    "another method has been proposed by thomas and co - workers @xcite in which a spatially varying potential correlates an atomic resonance frequency with the atomic position .",
    "in addition , a few schemes for position measurement were performed , using absorption light masks @xcite in which the precision of measurement achieved , was nearly tens of nanometers .",
    "recently , subwavelength localization of an atom in a standing - wave field was demonstrated in the case of resonant atom - field coupling .",
    "for example , two localization schemes were proposed by zubairy and co - workers using either measurement of the spontaneous spectrum in a three - level system or the resonant fluorescence in a two - level system for localization of the atom during its motion in the standing wave @xcite .",
    "another related localization scheme based on measurement of the upper - state population has been proposed by paspalakis and knight @xcite for a three - level @xmath0-type atom interacting with two fields , a laser probe field and a classical standing - wave field .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the two - dimensional ( 2d ) subwavelength localization of an atom in a four - level tripod system due to interaction with a probe laser field and two resonant standing - wave fields .",
    "in fact , most 2d level systems consisting of a large number of levels do not match for a subwavelength localization scheme because of interference among states . on the other hand , tripod configuration of atomic levels",
    "consists only of four levels involving three atomic ground states and one excited state .",
    "we should point out that tripod schemes are experimentally accessible in metastable ne , @xmath1rb and a number of other gases @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we give the equations of motion of the density - matrix elements in this configuration which are valid for both the running - wave and standing - wave cases of the probe field .",
    "in these equations , the spontaneous decay from the upper state to ground states is taken into account .",
    "sections [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] demonstrate a high - precision localization due to measurement of the upper - state population as well as of a ground - state population .",
    "the spatial structures of the populations take the form of spikes , craters or waves depending on the atom - field coupling .",
    "moreover , using measurement of a ground - state population , the atom can be localized at the nodes of the standing waves .",
    "the laser configuration consists of two parallel @xmath2 , @xmath3 polarized optical waves and an orthogonal linearly polarized optical wave .",
    "in such a configuration the positive frequency part of the electric field can be written as @xmath4 the first term corresponds to a @xmath2 circularly polarized wave with the frequency @xmath5 and the second one corresponds to a @xmath3 circularly polarized wave with the frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the third term describes a linearly polarized wave with the frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the electrical fields of the standing waves are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while the @xmath10 corresponds to an additional probe field . the probe field can be either a running wave @xmath11 along the @xmath12 direction or a standing wave @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spatial phase shift between the standing waves @xmath15 and @xmath10 .",

    "the atom interacts with the probe laser field @xmath10 , which is resonant with the @xmath31 transition , with the detuning @xmath32 .",
    "the coupling of the atom with each of the strong standing waves is characterized by the rabi frequencies @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the rabi frequency of the probe field is @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "we assume that the center - of - mass position of the atom is nearly constant along the directions of the laser waves and neglect the kinetic part of the atom from the hamiltonian in the raman - nath approximation @xcite .",
    "note that during the interaction the atomic position does not change directly and our localization scheme only influences the internal states of the atom .",
    "then , in the interaction picture and the rotating wave approximation the equations of matrix - density elements can be written as    [ eq ] @xmath38    together with @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the atomic decay takes place from the level @xmath24 to the levels @xmath42 with the rates @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the decay rates of atomic coherences between the upper level and ground levels equal @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "coherent decay rates @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are usually much less than the rates of decay through the @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) channels , so the approximate equalities are @xmath54 .",
    "the dynamics of interaction vary depending on the position of the atom which passes through laser fields in the @xmath55 position . in case of a long - time interaction the final populations in internal states",
    "are defined only by the laser fields and the atom does not need an initial - state preparation .",
    "the final distribution of the upper - level population depends on three controllable detunings @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and on the rabi frequencies of the driving fields , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . also , in a standing - wave case of the probe field the distribution depends on spatial shift @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , controlling the parameters of this interaction allows us to create different patterns of the upper - level population .",
    "when the probe laser field is weak the measurement of the upper - state population leads to a high - precision localization , as shown in the related 1d scheme for a three - level @xmath0-type atom @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is satisfied and obtain the long - time population in state @xmath24 in second order of perturbation theory . note that the second - order perturbation theory is correct only when @xmath64 , which corresponds to the atomic positions far from the nodes of standing waves @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    in the limit case of @xmath65 the atomic population",

    "<S> we propose a scheme for two - dimensional ( 2d ) atom localization in a four - level tripod system under an influence of two orthogonal standing - wave fields . </S>",
    "<S> position information of the atom is retained in the atomic internal states by an additional probe field either of a standing or of a running wave . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the localization factors depend crucially on the atom - field coupling that results in such spatial structures of populations as spikes , craters and waves . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a high - precision localization due to measurement of population in the upper state or in any ground state . </S>"
