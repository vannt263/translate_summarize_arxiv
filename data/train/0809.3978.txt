    "minority game ( mg ) is a model of adaptive behavior in multi - agent systems where being in minority is profitable @xcite .",
    "each agent can individually adapt to variable state of the system by updating its choice algorithms , called strategies .",
    "this adaptation can be done using data from the sequence of recent winning decisions .",
    "strategies are ranked every time by evaluating their utilities , dependent on the integrated population actions , such that the best strategy can be chosen .",
    "the mg was originally formulated @xcite for one public sequence @xmath0 of winning minority decisions .",
    "there was also one binary choice set , available for each agent , and actions were defined on the same set of events .",
    "overall _ demand _ , being a sum of individual actions , was calculated for the whole set of agents .",
    "using analogy to bargain on a stock exchange , where actions are interpreted as _ sell _ or _ buy _ , we call such game a _ single - market minority game _ ( smg )",
    ".     representation of mmg where each agent ( black point ) is linked to the market ( white point ) where it acts . ]    observing real financial markets one immediately finds that large numbers of investors use to act concurrently on many markets , usually different in size , deciding not only on their sell / buy actions but , first of all , choosing the market .",
    "this naturally motivates to generalize the original minority game in order to account for such multi - market agent activity and call it the _ multi - market minority game _ ( mmg ) .",
    "the mmg can be visualized as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the open symbols refer to markets , the black ones to agents and link between an agent and a market represents enablement of the agent to play on this market .",
    "if the agent actually acts on the market the corresponding link is called _",
    "active_.    in this paper , among other things , we are particularly interested in distribution of market occupancies and its time evolution . in many network systems",
    "it is observed @xcite that a small number of nodes absorbs majority of active links .",
    "we can see the similar phenomenon in the mmg where significant differences between numbers of agents acting on different markets arise in course of the game .",
    "further in the paper we call this phenomenon the _ breakdown of the symmetry of choice_.",
    "the mmg consists of @xmath1 agents and @xmath2 markets . at each time step @xmath3 , the @xmath4-th agent @xmath5 chooses a preferable market @xmath6 and takes action @xmath7 on this market . for each market",
    "@xmath8 an aggregated demand is defined @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of agents who chose market @xmath8 at time @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath11 is thus the difference between numbers of agents who choose the @xmath12 and @xmath13 actions .",
    "agents do not know each other s actions but @xmath11 is known to all agents on the market . for each market",
    "@xmath8 the minority action is determined @xmath14 each agent s memory is limited to @xmath15 most recent winning decisions .",
    "each agent has the same number @xmath16 of devices , called strategies , per market , altogether @xmath17 strategies per agent .",
    "strategies are used to predict the next minority action @xmath18 .",
    "the strategy of the @xmath4-th agent , @xmath19 , is a function mapping the sequence @xmath0 of last @xmath15 winning decisions to this agent s action @xmath20 . since for each market",
    "there is @xmath21 possible realizations of @xmath22 , there is @xmath23 possible strategies per market . at the beginning of the game",
    "each agent randomly draws @xmath24 strategies for each of @xmath2 markets , according to a given distribution function @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a set consisting of @xmath24 strategies . for clarity",
    ", we give the flow chart of the game in appendix a , where the processes of generation of the memory pools and taking decisions by agents are better illustrated .",
    "each strategy @xmath19 , belonging to any of sets @xmath26 , is given a real - valued function @xmath27 which quantifies the utility of the strategy : the more preferable strategy , the higher utility it has .",
    "strategies with higher utilities are more likely chosen by agents .",
    "there are various choice policies . in the popular _ greedy policy",
    "_ each agent selects the strategy of the highest utility @xmath28 the strategy ( [ eq3 ] ) used by the agent is called the _ active strategy _ , in contrast to _ passive strategies _ unused at given moment . at given time an agent acts only on one market related to the active strategy . however , every time it evaluates all its strategies , active and passive ones .",
    "each strategy @xmath19 is given the _ payoff _ related to its action @xmath29 @xmath30 , \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is an odd function , e.g. @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "other choices are @xmath33 or @xmath34 , the latter used in the present work",
    ". the learning process corresponds to updating the utility for each strategy @xmath35 such that each agent knows how good its strategies are .",
    "we distinguish two types of markets : the _ regular _ where all @xmath1 agents can choose any market , and _ irregular _ one where @xmath36 agents can play only on one market and remaining @xmath37 agents can choose both ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     similarly to the @xmath38 case",
    ", the occupancies stabilize and the largest occupancy corresponds to the market with the largest demand fluctuations .",
    "consider irregular markets with variable @xmath36 and fixed @xmath39 .",
    "one expects that increasing @xmath36 amplifies the probability of high @xmath40 and expects significant increase of utilities for all strategies on the first market .",
    "further reasoning follows that , for the regular mmg , high @xmath40 has no impact on the market preference of agents playing on market 1 but seriously affects those on market 2 .",
    "the mean presence on market 1 grows indefinitely and is asymptotically linear with @xmath36 @xmath41 for the mean presence on market 2 there exists the limit @xmath42 fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] presents simulations for mean occupancies and demand variances as functions of @xmath43 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , when the market 1 grows then the market 2 becomes more efficient .",
    "this is understandable because if @xmath44 agents were separated then such market would work in the herd mode @xcite . allowing agents to act also on market 1 spurs some of them to do that .",
    "the larger @xmath36 , the bigger fraction of @xmath44 prefers market 1 and the smaller fraction of @xmath44 prefers market 2 .",
    "consequently , @xmath45 converges to the limit ( [ eq7 ] ) , equal to 75 for our simulation .",
    "decreasing @xmath44 makes smooth transition of market 2 from the herd mode to the cooperation mode , reflected in lower _ per capita _ fluctuations ( cf .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we considered the mmg as a natural generalization of the classical mg .",
    "although each agent has _ a priori _ the same probability to play on all markets , after some time most of them act on this market where relatively high aggregated demand occurs for the first time",
    ". this spontaneous breakdown of choice symmetry depends on the payoff function @xmath31 in eqn ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath34 strong fluctuation of demand significantly affects utilities and the effect is well visible .",
    "we checked that for weaker @xmath46 the effect if less pronounced and for @xmath32 it disappears .",
    "this corroborates our conjecture that in the mmg there may exist markets strongly attracting clients .",
    "how fast it occurs , it depends on the likelihood of strong demand fluctuation .",
    "this reminds the well - known phenomenon on the scale - free networks where links are absorbed by nodes very inhomogenously and the initial random inhomogeneity of absorptive power of nodes determines their further imparity in course of the evolution .",
    "this kind of behaviour can be also observed on real financial markets .",
    "large markets of high liquidity strongly attract agents because they enable easy conversion of chunks of assets into cash .",
    "this constitutes a feedback mechanism making these markets even more liquid , etc .    in our model of the mmg we pointed out that the effect of symmetry breaking is visible only for @xmath16 .",
    "however , the mathematical formalism introduced in the paper is true also for @xmath47 .",
    "as we mentioned in chapter 5 , the market occupancies @xmath48 stabilize at the levels @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "therefore the occupancies are equal for @xmath47 and the effect can not be observed .",
    "this explains why the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , using @xmath47 , did not observe any symmetry breaking in their model .",
    "we found that in the mmg there exists a critical value of @xmath51 above which agents behave asymmetrically . in this mode",
    "we observe collectivity in their behaviour .",
    "in particular , there always exists a history @xmath52 for which all agents on bigger market react identically .",
    "we are aware of similarities of the asymmetric mode to some mechanisms on real financial markets .",
    "the closest real analogy is perhaps financial crisis when majority of investors sell an asset .",
    "however , there are important shortcomings of our model with respect to reality , e.g. restriction of collectiveness to given history @xmath52 . in addition , in reality individuals usually do not continue their game just after selling an asset but may stay apart for some time",
    ". therefore adequacy of our mmg to real markets is still limited .",
    "we see some promising extensions of the classical mg which could improve the mmg . among them",
    "are the grand canonical approach @xcite , stochastic strategies @xcite and categorization of investors  @xcite .",
    "the diagram in fig .  [ figapp ] presents how the mmg is simulated . at any time step @xmath3",
    "each of @xmath1 agents examines the public pattern @xmath53 of @xmath15 most recent winning decisions on each of @xmath2 accessible markets ( @xmath54 , where @xmath38 in our example in fig .",
    "[ figapp ] ) .",
    "each agent acts according to its policy encoded in @xmath24 strategies per market ( @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ figapp ] ) .",
    "first , an agent chooses a strategy and then acts on the market assigned to this strategy . at any time one agent acts on one market only .",
    "subsequently , the aggregate demand @xmath11 and the minority action @xmath56 on the @xmath8-th market are calculated according to the minority rule .",
    "the @xmath11 constitutes a feedback to agents , used by them in the adaptation process .",
    "the @xmath56 is then concatenated with @xmath53 thus producing @xmath57 .",
    "the patterns @xmath57 are analysed by agents at @xmath58 .",
