    "few bodies problems have been studied for long time in celestial mechanics , either as simplified models of more complex planetary systems or as benchmark models where new mathematical theories can be tested .",
    "the three  body problem has been source of inspiration and study in celestial mechanics since newton and euler , in particular the restricted three body problem ( r3bp ) has demonstrated to be a good model of several systems in our solar system such as the sun - jupiter - asteroid system , and with less accuracy the sun - earth - moon system . in analogy with the r3bp , in this paper",
    "we study a restricted problem of four bodies consisting of three primaries moving in circular orbits keeping an equilateral triangle configuration and a massless particle moving under the gravitational attraction of the primaries . in 1933 in the copenhagen observatory , elis strmgren and co - workers performed a numerical investigation of the periodic orbits of the r3bp for the value @xmath1 of the mass parameter . in this investigation we can find a family of periodic orbits called _ class g_. this family originates form periodic orbits which poincar called _ premire sorte _ , @xcite , @xcite . from this simple beginning ,",
    "the family develops many variations and the natural end of this family could not be stated by the investigators in the copenhagen observatory .",
    "strmgren wrote in his conclusions that the termination of this family had to be an asymptotic periodic orbit spiralling into the equilibrium points @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "several subsequent numerical explorations were necessary to confirm this conjecture .",
    "however , an analytical proof of this conjecture was given by j. henrard @xcite until 1972 and later by buffoni @xcite .",
    "in those papers , henrard and buffoni give sufficient conditions to prove the conjecture in the more general framework of analytical hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom . these conditions",
    "amount to a transversality condition on the stable and unstable manifolds . in papers like",
    "@xcite @xcite there exist numerical explorations of several families of periodic orbits of the restricted four  body problem for some values of the masses , in these works we can find that some families become asymptotic to a equilibrium point named @xmath0 as the value of the jacobi constant at the equilibrium point is reached .",
    "so as in the r3bp , this numerical evidence requires to perform an analytical investigation to verify that the conditions for which the  blue sky catastrophe \" termination ocurrs are satisfied .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we state the equations of motion of the restricted four  body problem and we give some basic properties of the problem . in section 3",
    "we analyse the linealization of the equations of motion at the equilibrium point @xmath0 , in particular we will analyse the eigenvalues of the linear equations . in section 4",
    "we give a brief introduction to the normal form theory and an application to the restricted four  body problem will be performed . in section 5",
    "we analyse the normal form obtained and we will verify the conditions given in @xcite to prove a topologically transverse intersection between the stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "consider three point masses , called @xmath4 , moving in circular periodic orbits around their center of mass under their mutual newtonian gravitational attraction , forming an equilateral triangle configuration .",
    "a third massless particle moving in the same plane is acted upon the attraction of the primaries .",
    "the equations of motion of the massless particle referred to a synodic frame with the same origin , where the primaries remain fixed , are : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant , @xmath7 is the mean motion , @xmath8 is the distance of the massless particle to the primaries , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the vertices of equilateral triangle formed by the primaries , and ( @xmath11 ) denotes derivative with respect to time @xmath12 .",
    "we choose the orientation of the triangle of masses such that @xmath13 lies along the positive @xmath14axis and @xmath15 , @xmath16 are located symmetrically with respect to the same axis , see figure  [ triangle ] .",

    "then the equations ( [ sistemaconunidades ] ) become @xmath25 where we have used kepler s third law : @xmath26 , and the dot ( @xmath27 ) represents derivatives with respect to the dimensionless time @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the system ( [ sistemasinunidades ] ) will be defined if we know the vertices of triangle for each value of the masses . in this paper",

    "if @xmath41 , we obtain the rotating kepler s problem , with @xmath42 at the origin of coordinates .",

    "we use the notation shown in figure  [ eqpoints ] for the eight critical points .",
    "in the former section it was shown that the number of equilibrium points in the restricted four - body problem depend on the value of the masses of the primaries . in papers like @xcite and @xcite we can see that the stability of the collinear equilibrium points also depends on the values of the masses , in this paper we will perform a thorough study of the stability of the equilibrium point @xmath0 ( see figure [ eqpoints ] ) and its consequences .    if we write @xmath60 for the coordinates of the equilibrium point",
    "then the hamiltonian function centred at @xmath61 reads @xmath62 with @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath51 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 denote the positions of the primaries . expanding through second - order terms ,",
    "we obtain @xmath67 there are no linear terms because the expansion is performed at a equilibrium point and the constant term has been omitted because it does not contribute to the system of differential equations .",

    "a natural choose is the vector @xmath136 with @xmath137 the standard unitary vector in @xmath134 , it is not hard to see that @xmath138 and therefore @xmath139 the value of @xmath140 is approximately @xmath141 and therefore @xmath142 as in the r3bp .",

    "the coefficients of the these homogeneous polynomials correspond to the respective derivatives of order @xmath154 in the expansion of @xmath155 evaluated at the origin . because the equilibrium point is collinear we have that @xmath158 and therefore @xmath159 for all @xmath7 .",

    "the next step to calculate the desired normal form is to transform @xmath168 and @xmath169 under the change of coordinates @xmath117 , with help of a algebraic manipulator this is not problem , the interesting task is how to calculate the homological equations ( [ homological1 ] ) and ( [ homological2 ] ) .",

    "several authors use complex variables to perform the calculations of the normal form , however , it is worth noting that sometimes the normal forms under complex symplectic transformations do not determine the real normal forms @xcite , therefore we use only _ real _ symplectic transformations to do the calculations . in @xcite",

    "for this reason , we can repeat the process at any order . in particular after two steps we obtain @xmath202 the generating function can be known totally in every step without additional assumptions and it is entirely polynomial .",
    "now we want to apply the method explained above to calculate the hamiltonian ( [ transforseries2 ] ) in the case of the restricted four  body problem .",
    "let @xmath175 be the hamiltonian ( [ h0polar ] ) , as above , the first order homological equation to solve is @xmath203 if @xmath204 and we choose @xmath205 then the homological equation to solve is @xmath206 with @xmath207 . in polar coordinates the term @xmath168 looks like @xmath208 @xmath209 observe that the terms with @xmath194 appear in all the terms of @xmath168 therefore @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "if we write @xmath212 we can see that @xmath213 , so the first order generating function is given by @xmath214 where the exponents stand by the composition of operators . for the second order term we have to calculate @xmath215 and @xmath216 but @xmath217 then @xmath218 with @xmath219 , therefore the second order homological equation is @xmath220 with @xmath221 and @xmath222 , the second order homological equation is solved as before . note that along this section we have performed all the calculations without using the numerical values of the coefficients of the matrix @xmath123 and the polynomials @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",

    "this is a direct consequence of our construction of the normal form where we are not putting additional conditions on the generating function @xmath94 and using only real coordinates .",
    "we are interested in making a local analysis of the truncated system and of the stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "first , we will outline the construction of a versal deformation ( @xcite , @xcite ) of the normal form obtained in the previous section .",
    "it will useful recalling the definition of a versal deformation    [ def ] a deformation @xmath255 of @xmath256 is called @xmath257 if any deformation @xmath258 of @xmath259 is equivalent to a deformation induced from @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath260 for some change of parameters @xmath261 .",
    "this kind of deformation is useful to study the truncated system through resonance .",
    "we already said we do not have a explicit relation of the partial derivatives @xmath87 and @xmath88 with the mass parameter @xmath32 so we can not give a explicit relation between the parameters of the versal deformation with the mass parameter @xmath32 .",
    "therefore we just give a general relation of the parameters of the versal deformation with the quantities @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "consider the matrix @xmath152 related to the linear vector field @xmath175 , if we want to construct a versal deformation of the matrix @xmath152 we must take the matrix family @xmath262 where the matrix @xmath263 lies on the orthogonal complement of the orbit of @xmath152 @xcite , this is equivalent to ask that the matrix @xmath263 satisfies @xmath264=0 $ ] where @xmath265 denotes the adjoin of @xmath263 .",

    "consider the hamiltonian matrix @xmath116 of the linearised vector field of the r4bp @xmath269 where @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "we have found a linear symplectic transformation @xmath123 which brings @xmath272 into its normal form @xmath273 , as we said the matrix @xmath274 is a versal deformation of the matrix @xmath152 .",
    "consider now the family of matrices @xmath275 , @xmath276 is a deformation of @xmath152 ( in @xmath32 ) so , by the definition ( [ def ] ) there exists a change of parameters @xmath261 such that @xmath277 therefore @xmath278 and @xmath276 have the same characteristic polynomials , i.e. , the polynomials @xmath279 and @xmath280\\lambda^{2}+[(1+\\nu_{1})^{2}-\\nu_{2}]^{2}$ ] are equal .",

    "the parameters @xmath287 and @xmath285 are not independent and @xmath288 is a first integral so we have that the versal deformation depends only of the detuning parameter @xmath285 .",
    "now we are ready to make a study of the truncated system through resonance , the hamiltonian under consideration will be @xmath289 because @xmath288 is a constant we have obtained a system with one degree of freedom , we want to see which terms are the most important near the origin so we will use the scaling of @xcite in polar form @xmath290 @xmath291 @xmath292 @xmath293 @xmath294 which is symplectic with multiplier @xmath295 .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath296 if we ignore the higher order terms , we obtain the form of the truncated hamiltonian considered in @xcite with parameters @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "so from the conclusions of that work , we have that the stable and unstable manifolds of the truncated system are globally connected for @xmath299 and shrink to the equilibrium as @xmath300 , actually , when we consider small perturbations of the truncated system or equivalently , when we consider the higher order terms of the full system for @xmath96 sufficiently small the stable and unstable manifold may not agree but they will still intersect . this last affirmation is a an application of the poincar s argument that basically tells us that nondegenerate homoclinic points are stable under small perturbations . in the references @xcite and @xcite the reader can find detailed discussions on these topics .",
    "therefore , we have satisfied the required conditions under which the  blue sky catastrophe \" termination occurs : a topologically transverse intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of the equilibrium point @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we perform a brief numerical study of the unstable manifold @xmath301 and the stable manifold @xmath302 to show the transverse intersections which were predicted in the former section .",
    "we do not attempt to make an exhaustive numerical study of such manifolds so we will restrict ourselves to show some transverse intersections for a few values of the parameter @xmath32 we were able to calculate numerically .",
    "we recall that from the linearization around the equilibrium point @xmath0 was discussed in the section 3 we saw that for that point there exist a value of the mass parameter @xmath76 such that for all @xmath303 $ ] the eigenvalues given by ( [ charpoly ] ) are @xmath304 where @xmath305 and @xmath86 are real and strictly positive quantities .",
    "the general theory states that for this case the solution of the linear part of the equations ( [ sistemastandar ] ) is given by @xmath306 @xmath307 the coefficients are not independent . in @xcite",
    "it can be found that such coefficients satisfy the relation @xmath308 but the equilibrium point is collinear so @xmath309 then @xmath310 however , as we have seen along this paper , we can not know analytical relations between the eigenvalues and the mass parameter and therefore we do not have a explicit relation between the constants @xmath311 , @xmath312 and the mass parameter @xmath32 .",
    "so for a numerical globalization of the invariant manifolds @xmath301 and @xmath302 we have decided to take a set of initial conditions totally equivalent to the classical initial conditions shown in @xcite .",
    "our vector of initial conditions is given by @xmath313 where @xmath314 , @xmath315 , @xmath316 $ ] and @xmath317 and @xmath318 are in the unstable ( stable ) space @xmath319 @xmath320 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the equations of motion have the property that if @xmath321 , @xmath322 is a solution , then @xmath323 , @xmath324 is also a solution so the unstable and stable manifolds of the equilibrium point are symmetric with respect to the @xmath325axis and therefore is enough to calculate the manifold @xmath301 . in the r3bp and",
    "more recently in the restricted four body problem ( where the primaries are in a collinear configuration ) several authors @xcite , @xcite have studied the `` blue sky catastrophe '' termination and the asymptotic orbits by analyzing the transverse intersections of the invariant manifolds . in these cases",
    "the equilibrium points , where the bsc termination ocurrs , are off the @xmath325axis but in our case the equilibrium point @xmath0 is on this axis , so we have to be careful when developing the numerical globalization . as in the r3bp",
    "we use the @xmath326 plane to represent the transverse cuts of the invariants manifolds , this can be done because we are using the surface section @xmath327 and because the velocity @xmath328 can be put as function of @xmath14 and @xmath329 from the relation ( [ integralprimera ] ) . using ( [ sistemastandar ] ) and ( [ inicialesnumericas ] ) we compute and show in the figure ( [ cortes ] ) some transverse intersections of @xmath301 and @xmath302 on the symmetry axis . from the linear approximation we have that the flow is of spiral type in a small neighbourhood of the equilibrium point @xmath0 then the orbits on the unstable manifold have several intersections ( cuts ) with the surface section @xmath327 .",
    "therefore in the `` first '' cuts we do not expect having a transverse intersection @xmath330 of @xmath301 in the plane @xmath326 , so we have to consider the cuts when the orbits leave an appropriate neighbourhood that depends of the parameter @xmath96 . in the figure ( [ opcuartocorte ] )      we can see that after four cuts the orbits do not have orthogonal intersections ( @xmath330 ) with the symmetry axis and therefore the unstable manifold does not intersect the @xmath325 axis in the @xmath326 plane , when we continue the integration we observe that the influence of the primaries @xmath333 and @xmath334 appears on the orbits , if we use a regularization process this is not problem , the interesting phenomena is that the continuity of the @xmath301 observed in the first cuts is lost . in the figures ( [ cuartocortenegativo ] ) and ( [ cuartocortepositivo ] ) we show the unstable manifold for @xmath335 , in order to avoid congestion of the picture we present the manifold for @xmath336 $ ] and @xmath337 $ ] .",
