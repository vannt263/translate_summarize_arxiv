    "adiabatic methods in quantum mechanics play a fundamental role in the treatment of level crossing problems .",
    "the famous landau - zener system @xcite has been followed by several other models which were defined in two - level systems @xcite .",
    "these models induced many applications in atomic and molecular physics , for recent review see ref .",

    "it is common in all of the adiabatic systems that the hamiltonian is time - dependent .",
    "the instantaneous eigenstates define an adiabatic basis .",
    "suppose that at the initial time , one of the adiabatic states coincides with the initial state of the system . in most cases the adiabatic state that belongs to the eigenvalue zero",
    "is utilized for the transfer .",
    "if the system varies with time slowly enough , then its state vector follows adiabatically the adiabatic eigenstate and it will go over smoothly to the desired final state .",
    "the adiabaticity of the process guarantees its robustness with respect to fluctuations in the parameters of the couplings . in the limit of ideal adiabatic transfer ,",
    "the other eigenstates are not invoked in the evolution and their population remains zero throughout the whole time .",
    "the non - adiabatic corrections tend to involve these states , but the magnitudes of such couplings are supposed to be small compared with their energy separation from the adiabatic states .    during the last decade , a promising new population transfer technique was introduced : the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) process realizes efficient population transfer in three - level systems , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "moreover , it turned out that this scheme can be applied successfully to the problem of manipulating and creating coherent state superpositions .",
    "such superpositions are the desired initial states for many modern quantum applications including information processing and communication .",
    "the original stirap process has thus been utilized to create coherent superpositions in three- and four - level systems @xcite and to prepare @xmath7-component maximally coherent superposition states @xcite .",
    "the four - level ( tripod ) stirap establishes such applications as qubit rotation @xcite and density - matrix measurement @xcite .",
    "recently , a multilevel stirap scheme has been proposed @xcite to create @xmath8level coherent superposition states .",
    "this model is particularly interesting , since the hamiltonian has several adiabatic eigenstates which belong to the eigenvalue zero .",
    "the diabatic couplings among these eigenstates influence significantly the dynamics of the system . however , the eigenstates in the zero eigenvalue subspace are decoupled from the eigenstates belonging to nonzero eigenvalues provided the time - evolution is adiabatic . in ref .",
    "@xcite the optimal control theory has been applied to find the optimal pulse sequences which create a prescribed final superposition state .",
    "it has also been verified that the transfer process occurs in the zero - eigenvalue subspace . in a subsequent work",
    "@xcite an analytic solution has been presented for a five - level system .",
    "when the stirap concept is realized in atoms or molecules one encounters that the quantum states with angular momentum @xmath0 have magnetic sublevels and these sublevels are coupled by the applied laser pulses , and a rather complicated coupling - pattern may occur .",
    "this situation has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these papers",
    "the authors have discussed the possibility of transferring population from a well defined initial state to a single but arbitrarily chosen magnetic sublevel .",
    "an other realistic problem is the presence of multiple or continuum intermediate states @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the continuum has been modeled by infinite number of equidistant discrete levels which were coupled by unique couplings to a single initial and final state .",
    "later , it has been shown that the previous model is too simple , the physics is more complicated in a realistic situation @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the discrete model has been presented in ref .",
    "it has also been shown that efficient population transfer is indeed possible through a continuum @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will study a multilevel @xmath9 scheme similar to the one discussed in refs .",
    "however , in contrast with the previous works where the population transfer took place between a single initial and a single final state , our aim is to create a multilevel final superposition state . in our model , the initial state has angular momentum @xmath10 , the intermediate state has @xmath11 and the final superposition state is formed from the magnetic sublevels of a state @xmath12 .",
    "we will design a stirap - like process , i.e. the population transfer is realized by delayed , overlapping laser pulses .",
    "we define the hamiltonian corresponding to the process , separate the adiabatic states belonging to the eigenvalue zero and find the conditions for the successful population transfer .",
    "we will study how does the final state depend on the relative phases of the applied laser pulses .",
    "the robustness of the transfer process will also be discussed .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ model ] the physical model of our six - level stirap is presented and the corresponding hamiltonian is introduced .",
    "the hilbert space is separated to a zero - eigenvalue subspace and to a nonzero - eigenvalue subspace .",
    "the eigenstates belonging to the zero eigenvalue are determined explicitly . in section [ poptrans ]",
    "we study the possibility of population transfer by means of delayed laser pulses .",
    "we show numerically that nearly adiabatic evolution is possible .",

    "the dark and bright subspaces are separated .",
    "since we want to design a stirap - like population transfer process , in the following we focus our attention to the dark states .",
    "the bright states are needed when one wants to study the coupling between the dark and bright subspaces , but since the formulae for the bright states are too complicated , we shall do it in an other way .",
    "now we make a further assumption : we assume that the ratios @xmath76 and @xmath77 are constant during the time - evolution , i.e. the envelope function of the two pump pulses are the same , only their amplitudes and phases are different .",

    "the previous conditions suggest that for successful population transfer we need counterintuitive time ordering of the pump and stokes pulses , similarly to the original stirap .",
    "now we consider the possibility of adiabatic population transfer using the connectivity argument of ref .",
    "@xcite : the system hamiltonian has a constant zero eigenvalue which is degenerate . however , as we have shown in the beginning of this section , the nonadiabatic coupling between the two degenerate dark states vanishes because one of them is constant . as we have seen in the previous paragraphs , the time dependent dark state coincides with the initial state of the system at the beginning of the process when only the stokes pulse is present .",
    "similarly , this dark state lays in the required final state subspace at the end of the process when only the pump pulse is present .",

    "<S> we consider an adiabatic population transfer process that resembles the well established stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) . in our system , the states have nonzero angular momentums @xmath0 , therefore , the coupling laser fields induce transitions among the magnetic sublevels of the states . in particular , we discuss the possibility of creating coherent superposition states in a system with coupling pattern @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the system is in the @xmath3 state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that by two delayed , overlapping laser pulses it is possible to create any final superposition state of the magnetic sublevels @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that the relative phases of the applied pulses influence not only the phases of the final superposition state but the probability amplitudes as well . we show that if we fix the shape and the time - delay between the pulses , the final state space can be entirely covered by varying the polarizations and relative phases of the two pulses . </S>",
    "<S> performing numerical simulations we find that our transfer process is nearly adiabatic for the whole parameter set . </S>"
