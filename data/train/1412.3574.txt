    "over the past two decades , the world has witnessed the threat of infectious disease with long - range transmission , such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , the pandemic influenza a ( h1n1 ) and the 2014 ebola epidemic . an outbreak of the epidemic in human society is closely related to the spatial scale and the interaction structure .",
    "g. chowell et al .",
    "have investigated the growth patterns of the 2014 ebola epidemic at different spatial scales@xcite .",
    "they have found that the global and the local growth rates exhibit different scaling laws .",

    "the reaction - diffusion processes in complex systems and finding an effective way to prevent and control the outbreak of infectious disease have become an urgent but difficult challenge@xcite .",
    "in modelling the propagation of infectious disease , the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model and the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model represent two distinctive disease transmission processes@xcite . in the sis model ,",
    "each individual is initially in one of the two states : s ( susceptible ) and i ( infected ) .",
    "a susceptible individual may become infected as he encounters an infected individual , and an infected individual may become susceptible again after some time . in the sir model ,",
    "each individual is initially in one of the three states : s , i and r ( recovered )",
    ". the only difference between the sis model and the sir model is that , in the sir model , an infected individual firstly becomes healthy ( recovered ) , when he is immune to the disease . after some time , the recovered individual may become susceptible to the disease again .",
    "the spread of infectious disease is closely related to mobility patterns and interaction patterns of the population@xcite .",
    "an individual may move about aimlessly like a floating boat in the ocean or travel along a certain path like a move on the chessboard .",
    "two individuals may interact with each other day after day because they are in the same firm or only have a chance encounter because neither of them likes establishing a fixed relationship with any other people .",
    "the mobility patterns and the interaction patterns have been extensively studied in the coevolutionary dynamics .",

    "different network models are usually borrowed to simulate the mobility patterns and the interaction patterns@xcite .",

    "they have found that there exists a critical point for the onset of the epidemics .",
    "m. boguna et al . have studied the conditions for the absence of an epidemic threshold in heterogeneous networks@xcite . a delicate balance between the number of nodes with a high degree and the topological distance",
    "is found to be quite important for the occurrence of the threshold .    until today , in relation to the role of mobility patterns and connection patterns in the outbreak of epidemic , most of the studies consider the two factors respectively .",
    "however , in the real world , the evolutionary dynamics in reaction - diffusion systems is usually determined by the coupling of mobility and connectivity , especially the group dynamics in social and economic systems @xcite .",
    "for example , a susceptible individual may be infected by an unknown individual in a random walk after dinner or be infected by a business partner .",
    "the coupled effects of random walk and pre - arranged interaction on contagion are short of in - depth study . in relation to the measures for disease control and prevention , the government usually takes isolation measures to prevent the epidemic .",
    "for example , during the outbreak of the 2014 ebola epidemic , most countries tighten up on the rules for admitting people into the country .",

    "a. x. cui et al . have studied the effects of strong ties on the spread of the epidemic@xcite .",
    "they have found that the epidemic prevalence is promoted by the strong ties .",
    "although the mobility patterns and connection patterns have been considered as important factors for the spread of the epidemic , most of the studies focus on the effects of immunization and isolation , which especially rely on the knowledge of one s activity routine and one s friendship network . generally speaking , compared with the route of random walk , a predefined interaction structure is much easier to be understood . in view of",
    "the coupling of random walk and predefined interaction structure , the effect of local activity restriction on global epidemic suppression and the role of the shortcuts existing between the individuals geographically far away are worth extra attention .    inspired by the metapopulation epidemic model , the territorial epidemic model and the networked epidemic model in refs@xcite , in the present model , we incorporate a multi - layer network , which consists of a regular network with segregated spatial domains and a random network representing individual - based linkage , into the sis model .",
    "the coupled dynamics of random walk and pre - arranged linkage is investigated .",
    "the role of narrowing segregated spatial domain and reducing mobility in epidemic control is checked .",
    "the motivation of the present work is to find out how the individual - based linkage between segregated spatial domains affects the outbreak of the epidemic globally , just as the role of the shortcuts in the outbreak of the epidemic on the small world network .",
    "the following are our main findings .",
    "( 1)activating the prearranged linkage between different spatial domains can prompt the outbreak of the epidemic globally .",
    "as the value of timescale @xmath0 ranges continuously from 0 to unity , three regions are observed . within the region of @xmath1 ,",
    "the epidemic is determined by local movement and is sensitive to the timescale @xmath0 . within the region of @xmath2 ,",
    "the epidemic is insensitive to the timescale @xmath0 . within the region of @xmath3 , the outbreak of the epidemic",
    "is determined by the structure of the individual - based linkage .",
    "the role of activating the prearranged linkage in the present model is similar to the role of the shortcuts in the two - dimensional small world epidemic model . only activating a small number of the prearranged linkage",
    "can effectively promote the global outbreak of the epidemic .",
    "( 2)the size of the segregated spatial domain plays an important role in the outbreak of the epidemic . as both the overall spatial size and the population size",
    "are given , narrowing the segregated spatial domain not only slows down the spread of infectious disease but also leads to a decrease in the number of infected individuals in the final steady state .",
    "( 3)local mobility has a great impact on the global spread of infectious disease .",
    "on condition that there is little individual - based connection , reducing local mobility can effectively suppress the global spread of epidemic .",
    "( 4)a heuristic analysis indicate that the change of the macroscopic characteristics of the propagation of the epidemic in the present model is closely related to the change of the scaling laws for the epidemic threshold and the mean first encounter time on a two - dimensional lattice with overlapping spatial domains .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the sis model with a multi - layer network",
    "is introduced in section two . in section three ,",
    "simulation results are presented and discussed in detail .",
    "the epidemic dynamics is analyzed in section four and conclusions are drawn in section five .",
    "in the present model , each individual has two possible activities : acting as a random walker whose activity domain is restricted to a given local area and acting as a businessman whose activity is confined to interacting with his familiars . in order to model the evolutionary dynamics in local movement and global interaction ( activating the prearranged linkage ) respectively , we incorporate a multi - layer network with two subnetworks , which are called residential area and relationship network respectively throughout the paper , into the sis model .",
    "the restricted residential area is common in territorial animals , where each individual is confined to local area and shares overlapping area with their neighbors@xcite .",
    "the relationship network is common in human society , which is a kind of relatively fixed person - to - person relation and has nothing to do with geographic distance@xcite .",
    "such relationship is usually modelled as a random network , a small world network or a scalefree network@xcite .",
    "similar to that in ref.@xcite .",
    "the residential area is a regular network with @xmath4 sites , each of which has eight connected neighbor sites .",
    "the overall spatial domain is divided into @xmath5 segregated spatial domains .",
    "the area of each domain is @xmath6 and the overlapping area of two nearby domains is @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "there are total n ( @xmath9 @xmath4 ) individuals staying on the sites of the residential area , each of whom can move along the link between the sites but is not allowed to walk out of the segregated spatial domain which is randomly allocated to each individual at the initial time .    the relationship network is a random network with n sites and @xmath10 links on average for each site .",
    "different sites denote different individuals and the links between sites denote social relations between the individuals .",
    "the prearranged interaction only takes place between the individuals with immediate connections . as the value of @xmath11 increases from 0 to unity , the relationship network changes from a disconnected network to a fully - connected network .",
    "different from the original networked epidemic model , where the existence of the links between different individuals means the existence of the interactions between them . in the present model",
    ", the existence of these links only means the possibility of the interactions .",
    "only when the links are activated , the interactions between the individuals really take place .",
    "the reaction - diffusion process in the multi - layer network is as follows .",
    "there exists a timescale @xmath0 between prearranged interaction and local movement . at each time step ,",
    "an individual i firstly makes his decision whether to interact with his familiar or go for a random walk .",
    "he makes prearranged interaction with probability @xmath0 and makes local movement with probability @xmath12 . in the process of local movement , individual i firstly makes his decision whether to move or not with probability @xmath13 .",
    "if he chooses `` yes '' , he randomly chooses a neighbor site from the total nine connected sites to stay on .",
    "if the chosen site is outside the local area , he does not move .",
    "if he chooses `` no '' , he does not make a movement .",
    "after the movement decision has been made , for an infected individual , he becomes susceptible with probability @xmath14 . for a susceptible individual ,",
    "he becomes infected with probability @xmath15 , in which @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the number of susceptible individuals and infected individuals respectively and @xmath18 is the total number of individuals on the same site . in the process of prearranged interaction ,",
    "individual i firstly chooses an individual j from his connected neighbors . then",
    ", if individual i is an infected individual , he becomes susceptible with probability @xmath14 .",
    "if individual i is a susceptible individual and individual j is an infected individual , individual i becomes infected with probability @xmath19 .",
    "the updating is made asynchronously .",
    "therefore , as the value of timescale @xmath0 ranges continuously from 0 to unity , the present model changes from the territorial epidemic model to the random network epidemic model . the residential area and the relationship network are coupled by the individuals .",
    "the local epidemic dynamics and the global epidemic dynamics are coupled by the time scale @xmath0 . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the global interaction process is faster than the local interaction process . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the global interaction process is the same as the local interaction process . for @xmath22 ,",

    "the above results can be understood as follows . for @xmath0=0 , as each individual is confined to his local domain , a longer separation leads to a higher epidemic threshold and a smaller ratio of the infected individuals in the final steady state . for @xmath101 ,",
    "the activation of a small number of shortcuts produces a shorter separation , which leads to a lower epidemic threshold and a larger ratio of the infected individuals in the final steady state .",
    "the propagation speed of the epidemic is related to the pairwise interaction between an infected individual and a susceptible individual .",
    "if the mean first encounter time between different individuals is small , it is much easier for the epidemic to break out . on one - dimensional lattice with segregated spatial domains",
    ", it has been found that the mean first encounter time is related to the size of the segregated domain @xmath102 and the size of the overlapping area @xmath103@xcite . in the present model , the individuals",
    "are confined to two - dimensional lattice with segregated spatial domains . by calculating the mean first encounter time",
    ", we can find out the relationship between the encounter probability and the variables of the size of the segregated domain @xmath57 and the average number of individuals in each segregated domain @xmath78 .",
    "the microscopic characteristics of the epidemic on a two - dimensional lattice with segregated spatial domains can be understood .",
    "the mean first encounter time ( a ) as a function of the average number of individuals in each segregated spatial domain for @xmath57=25(circles ) , 100(squares ) , 225(triangles ) and ( b ) as a function of the area of segregated spatial domain for @xmath104 .",
    "other parameters are @xmath23 , @xmath95 , @xmath11=0 , @xmath0=0 .",
    "final results are averaged over 50 runs.,width=377 ]    in figure 6 ( a ) we plot the mean first encounter time as a function of the average number @xmath78 of individuals in each segregated spatial domain for @xmath77 . for simplicity and refraining from the border effect , here we only consider the case where the domain is satisfied with the condition @xmath26 .",
    "it is observed that , for @xmath105 , as @xmath78 increases from @xmath106 to @xmath107 , @xmath108 decreases from @xmath109 to @xmath110 . increasing @xmath102 ( @xmath111 ) leads to an overall rise of the value of @xmath108 .",
    "a scaling law for @xmath112 , in which @xmath113 , is found . as the value of @xmath102 changes from @xmath114 to @xmath115 , the value of @xmath116 changes little . in figure 6 ( b )",
    "we plot the mean first encounter time as a function of the size of the segregated spatial domain for @xmath79=1 . a scaling law for @xmath117 , in which @xmath118 , is found .    comparing the results in figure 3 ( a ) with the results in figure 6 ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", we find that a decrease in @xmath34 by narrowing the segregated spatial domain should result from the competition of the following two processes : a decrease in the area of the segregated spatial domain and a decrease in the average number of individuals in each domain . in the present model , the population size and the spatial size",
    "are fixed .",
    "a decrease in the size of the segregated spatial domain leads to an increase in the total number of the segregated spatial domains and a decrease in the average number of individuals in each domain . from the simulation results in figure 6 ( a ) and ( b ) we find that a decrease in the size of the segregated spatial domain leads to a decrease in the mean first encounter time while a decrease in the average number of individuals in each segregated spatial domain leads to an increase in the mean first encounter time . in the present model ,",
    "the decrease of the mean first encounter time resulting from the decrease of the size of the segregated spatial domain should be slower than the increase of the mean first encounter time resulting from the decrease of the number of individuals in each segregated spatial domain .",
    "therefore , the coupling of the above two contradictory processes leads to the occurrence of the macroscopic characteristics of the outbreak of the epidemic in figure 3 ( a ) , that is , the smaller the size of the segregated spatial domain , the lower the ratio of the infected individuals in the final steady state .",
    "by incorporating segregated spatial domains and individual - based linkage into the sis model , we investigate the coupled effects of local movement and global interaction on contagion .",
    "the role of activating the prearranged linkage between different spatial domains in the outbreak of the epidemic is especially concerned .",
    "compared with the scenario where only random walk exists , the existence of shortcuts between different spatial domains leads to a wider spread of the epidemic .",
    "the effects of home range restriction and mobility restriction on epidemic control are extensively investigated .",
    "when the global interaction is restricted , both narrowing the segregated spatial domain and reducing local mobility can effectively curb the spread of the epidemic .",
    "activating the prearranged linkage makes the epidemic control methods become less effective .",
    "a heuristic analysis indicates that the macroscopic characteristics of the propagation of the epidemic in the present model is closely related to the microscopic characteristics of the individuals moving on two - dimensional lattice .",
    "activating the shortcuts between different spatial domains lowers the epidemic threshold effectively and therefore prompt the outbreak of the epidemic . narrowing the segregated spatial domain leads to a decrease in the area of random walk and a decrease in the average number of individuals in each area simultaneously .",
    "the coupling of the two processes results in an increase in the mean first encounter time and therefore the effectiveness of activity restriction on epidemic control .    in the future , the coupled effects of mobility patterns and interaction patterns on the evolutionary dynamics will be extensively studied in reaction - diffusion systems and game models .",
    "the evolutionary dynamics of one to many interactions in similar coupled systems will be investigated in the near future .",
