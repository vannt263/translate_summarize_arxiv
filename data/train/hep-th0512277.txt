    "string theory has made great progress in understanding the microphysics of black holes .",
    "in particular , for certain ( nearly ) supersymmetric black holes , one is able to show that the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath0 , as computed in the strongly - coupled supergravity description , can be reproduced in a weakly - coupled d - brane description as the degeneracy of the relevant microstates @xcite  for reviews , see @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite provides further insights into these issues by providing a dictionary relating the geometric description of the physics in the near - horizon region with the physics of a dual conformal field theory  see @xcite for a review . in particular , the ads / cft indicates that hawking evaporation should be a unitary process , in keeping with the basic tenets of quantum theory .",
    "the discussion of black holes in the context of the ads / cft correspondence makes evident that the path integral over geometries in the bulk may include multiple saddle - points , several classical supergravity solutions , as found in @xcite .",
    "another point that was realized early on is that the geometric description of individual microstates would not have a horizon @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", mathur and collaborators have incorporated these ideas in a radical revision of the stringy description of black holes  for a review , see @xcite .",
    "they argue that each of the cft microstates corresponds to a separate spacetime geometry with no horizon .",
    "the black hole is dual to an ensemble of such microstates and so the black hole geometry only emerges in a coarse - grained description which ` averages ' over the @xmath1 microstate geometries .",
    "in particular , this averaging should produce an effective horizon at a radius where the individual microstate geometries start to ` differ appreciably ' from one another @xcite .",
    "therefore in this scenario , quantum gravity effects are not confined close to the black hole singularity , rather the entire interior of the black hole is ` filled ' by fluctuating geometries  hence this picture is often referred to as the ` fuzzball ' description of black holes . the first support for this proposal came from finding agreement between the propagation time of excitations in the throat of certain microstate geometries and in the dual brane description @xcite .",
    "a further remarkable feature , that has drawn attention to these ideas , is that there is growing evidence that the microstate geometries may be smooth , as well as horizon - free . in the case of the d1-d5 system",
    ", smooth asymptotically flat geometries can be constructed corresponding to all of the rr ground states in the dual cft @xcite . despite their large degeneracy",
    ", this two - charge system will not produce a macroscopic black hole horizon .",
    "however , a large horizon can be produced by introducing a third charge , kaluza - klein momentum @xcite .",
    "recently progress has been made in constructing smooth microstate geometries in the d1-d5-p system @xcite .",
    "while large families of such solitons are now known , a complete understanding of the three - charge case remains to be found .",
    "further preliminary work on the four charge system of d1-d5-p - kk has also appeared @xcite .    in general , the preceding discussion connecting microstates with smooth geometries focuses on supersymmetric configurations .",
    "this raises the interesting question of how the fuzzball proposal would be extended to non - supersymmetric black holes . in particular",
    ", are there non - supersymmetric versions of the smooth horizon - free geometries corresponding to non - bps microstates ?",
    "remarkably , jejjala , madden , ross and titchener @xcite recently extended the known set of d1-d5 microstate geometries with a family of non - supersymmetric solutions , hereafter referred to as solitons .",
    "the solutions comprise a five - parameter family of non - supersymmetric smooth geometries which are asymptotically flat .",
    "these solutions may be parameterized by the d1-brane and d5-brane charges , the ( asymptotic ) radius of the internal circle with kaluza - klein momentum , and by two integers @xmath2 and @xmath3 which fix the remaining physical parameters .",
    "these integers also determine a spectral flow in the cft which allows the underlying microstate to be identified .",
    "for @xmath4 , the solitons reduce to supersymmetric solutions found previously in @xcite .",
    "an important feature which distinguishes the solitons from any of the analogous supersymmetric solutions is the presence of an ergoregion . as a consequence , in these non - supersymmetric geometries",
    ", there is an inner region ( that extends to the origin ) where states of negative energy are allowed .",
    "this then leads naturally to the question of whether or not the ergoregion produces an instability of the background .",
    "one possibility is that the ergoregion may lead to superradiant scattering which can produce a catastrophic instability in some situations @xcite .",
    "however in the present case , this possibility is easily dismissed @xcite because the solutions are horizon - free .",
    "since the seminal work of zeldovich @xcite on superradiant amplification of electromagnetic waves incident upon an absorbing cylinder , it has been known that the key ingredients for superradiance is the existence of an ergoregion _ and _ an absorbing surface . for black holes ,",
    "the horizon plays the latter role but certainly the geometries lack such a surface .",
    "quite interestingly , there is another class of instabilities , which we simply refer to as ` ergoregion instabilities ' , that generically afflict spacetime geometries with an ergoregion , but no horizon .",
    "these instabilities were first discovered by friedman @xcite , who provided a very general discussion .",
    "explicit computations of the instability were later made in @xcite for the case of rotating stars with an ergoregion . there",
    "the existence of this instability was explicitly verified for a free scalar field in the background of a rotating star . according to friedman",
    "s general arguments however , the instability should also exist for electromagnetic and gravitational waves .",
    "since the solutions @xcite have an ergoregion but no horizon , one might suspect that a similar ergoregion instability would arise in these geometries .",
    "the present paper then explicitly verifies the presence of an ergoregion instability for the backgrounds with a variety of techniques .",
    "further we consider the endpoint of the resulting decay and argue that it should be a smooth supersymmetric solution .",
    "our results have immediate consequences for the endpoint of tachyon decay discussed in @xcite . there , ross extended the discussion of @xcite to d1-d5 black strings for which he identified tachyonic string modes in a particular winding sector .",
    "he argued that the condensation of these tachyons would transform the spacetime to a soliton . in conjunction with the above results ,",
    "we see that these solutions can not be the final endpoint of these decays but rather they should end with a supersymmetric microstate geometry",
    ". our analysis and the ergoregion instability may also have interesting implications for mathur s fuzzball proposal more generally .",
    "the remainder of our paper is organized as follows : section [ general ] provides a brief exposition on friedman s analysis @xcite . in section",
    "[ formalism ] , we briefly review some of the features of the solutions and present the main equations used in the subsequent analysis , namely the radial and angular wave equations for a free massless scalar field , as well as some of their properties . in section [ wkb ]",
    "we compute the details of the instability using a wkb approach @xcite .",
    "we show explicitly that the instability exists for a general non - supersymmetric geometry of @xcite , and that it disappears for supersymmetric objects , as expected . in section",
    "[ sec : match ] , we use an alternative method , that of matched asymptotic expansions , to investigate the instability and its properties . the methods of sections [ wkb ] and [ sec : match ] are complementary , their regime of validity is different . we then perform a numerical analysis of the wave equation in section [ numerical ] to complement the analytical calculations .",
    "we find that the results of both analytical analyses agree remarkably well with the numerical results . in section [ conclusion ] , after summarizing the main properties of the ergoregion instability , we discuss various related topics : the endpoint of this instability ; its consequences for ross s tachyon condensation @xcite ; general implications for the fuzzball picture of black holes .",
    "there are two classes of instabilities that are of potential interest for the backgrounds @xcite ( or non - supersymmetric geometries in general ) , namely : the superradiant instability , and the ergoregion instability . in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate why superradiance is not present in these geometries , as first noted in @xcite , and we introduce the general argument of @xcite that suggests an ergoregion instability is present . in the following sections , we verify the presence of the ergoregion instability with a complete analytic and numerical analysis of its properties .      for a general ( stationary asymptotically flat ) black hole ,",
    "the equations describing spin-@xmath5 fields can always be written as + v(,r)=0[wave]where @xmath6 was introduced with a fourier transform with respect to the asymptotic time coordinate : @xmath7 .",
    "the radius @xmath8 is a convenient tortoise coordinate and in general one finds : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a positive constant .",
    "the potential @xmath11 can be a rotational potential ( in the kerr geometry @xmath12 , with @xmath2 an azimuthal number , and @xmath13 the angular velocity at the horizon ) or a chemical potential ( in the reissner - n@xmath14rdstrom geometry , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the charge of the field and @xmath17 the charge of the black hole ) .    for a wave scattering in this geometry ,",
    "( [ wave ] ) yields the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath18 these boundary conditions correspond to an incident wave of unit amplitude from @xmath19 giving rise to a reflected wave of amplitude @xmath20 going back to @xmath19 and a transmitted wave of amplitude @xmath21 at the horizon  the boundary condition introduces only ingoing waves at the horizon . assuming a real potential ( which is almost always the case ) the complex conjugate of the solution @xmath22 satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ bound2 ] ) will satisfy the complex - conjugate boundary conditions : @xmath23 now , these two solutions are linearly independent , and the standard theory of ode s tells us that their wronskian , @xmath24 , is a constant ( independent of @xmath25 ) .",
    "if we evaluate the wronskian near the horizon , we get @xmath26 , and near infinity we find @xmath27 . equating the two we get @xmath28 now , in general @xmath29 is less than unity , as is to be expected .",
    "however , for @xmath30 we have that @xmath31 .",
    "such a scattering process , where the reflected wave has actually been amplified , is known as superradiance .",
    "of course the excess energy in the reflected wave must come from that of the black hole , which therefore decreases .",
    "superradiant scattering can lead to an instability if , we have a reflecting wall surrounding the black hole that scatters the returning wave back toward the horizon . in such a situation , the wave will bounce back and forth , between the mirror and the black hole , amplifying itself each time .",
    "the total extracted energy grows exponentially until finally the radiation pressure destroys the mirror .",
    "this is press and teukolsky s black hole bomb , first proposed in @xcite .",
    "this instability can arise with an effective ` mirror ' in a variety of situations : a scalar field with mass @xmath32 in a kerr background creates a potential that can cause flux to scatter back toward the horizon @xcite ; infinity in asymptotically ads spaces also provides a natural wall @xcite that leads , for certain conditions , to an instability ; a wave propagating around rotating black branes or rotating black strings may similarly find itself trapped @xcite .",
    "suppose now there is no horizon in the background spacetime .",
    "what changes with respect to the former discussion is the boundary conditions : since there is no horizon and no absorption . for this case ,",
    "the boundary condition ( [ bound2 ] ) at the horizon is replaced by some kind of regularity condition at the origin .",
    "we suppose the radial coordinate @xmath25 now ranges from zero to infinity and we impose the following boundary condition : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is some well - behaved _ real _ function .",
    "this ansatz encompasses for instance typical regularity requirements where , one chooses @xmath35 with @xmath36 . repeating the above calculation",
    ", one gets @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the absence of a horizon , which precludes any absorption , prevents superradiance and hence the superradiant instability",
    ".    nevertheless , geometries with an ergoregion but without horizons are the arena of another class of instability .",
    "this ergoregion instability was discovered by friedman @xcite . even though his discussion was made in four - dimensions only , it is trivial to extend it to any number of dimensions .",
    "the instability arises because of the following @xcite : given the test field energy - momentum tensor @xmath38 , we can associate a canonical energy @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the background killing vector which generates time translations in the asymptotic geometry . now , because @xmath41 is space - like within an ergosphere , initial data can be chosen on a cauchy surface s which makes @xmath42 negative .",
    "moreover , it is shown in @xcite that the energy can be negative only when the test field is time dependent . then , since the field is time dependent , and since only positive energy can be radiated at future null infinity , the value of @xmath42 can only decrease further from one asymptotically null hypersurface @xmath43 to another , say , @xmath44 , in the future of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the energy @xmath42 will typically grow negative without bound .",
    "this instability was computed analytically using a wkb approximation in @xcite for rotating stars .",
    "there it was shown that the instability timescale is usually very large ( typically larger than the age of the universe ) .",
    "the analysis of @xcite was improved in @xcite where further details of the instability were computed numerically .",
    "a key assumption above is that the system can not settle down to a negative energy configuration which , while time dependent , is nonradiative .",
    "friedman @xcite was able to rule out such marginal cases where @xmath42 is negative but constant for a four - dimensional massless scalar or electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , in fact , one is able to identify negative energy bound states for the backgrounds  see appendix [ sec : a2 ]  and so a more thorough analysis is called for .",
    "hence , in the following , we apply a variety of techniques to explicitly show that these microstate geometries suffer from an ergoregion instability .",
    "we now consider wave propagation of a free massless scalar field in the backgrounds @xcite , and from this identify an ergoregion instability for these geometries in the subsequent sections .",
    "the solutions are described in detail in @xcite and are quite involved .",
    "we will provide a brief discussion of some of the properties of these solutions here , but will refer the reader to @xcite for the full details .",
    "the solitons are solutions of type iib supergravity corresponding to three - charge microstate geometries of the d1-d5-p system .",
    "the system is compactified to five dimensions on @xmath45 with the d5-branes wrapping the full internal space and the d1-branes and kk - momentum on the distinguished @xmath46 .",
    "the notation is best understood by considering the construction of these solutions .",
    "one begins with the general solutions of @xcite which contain eight parameters : a mass parameter , @xmath47 ; spin parameters in two orthogonal planes , @xmath48 ; three boost parameters , @xmath49 , which fix the d1-brane , d5-brane and kk - momentum charges , respectively ; the radius of the @xmath46 , @xmath50 ; the volume of the @xmath51 ( which plays no role in the following ) . the geometry is described by the six - dimensional line element written in eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) of @xcite , which is parameterized by a time coordinate @xmath52 ; a radial coordinate @xmath25 ; three angular coordinates @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ; and the coordinate on the @xmath46 , @xmath56 .",
    "one then imposes a series of constraints to ensure that the solutions are free of singularities , horizons and closed time - like curves . in particular , one focuses on a low - mass regime , @xmath57 , in which no black holes exist .",
    "then one finds solitonic solutions where an appropriate circle shrinks to zero at the origin and the constraints ensure that this happens smoothly .",
    "first , @xmath47 and @xmath50 can be fixed in terms of the remaining parameters  see eqs .",
    "( 3.15 ) and ( 3.20 ) of @xcite .",
    "two quantization conditions constrain the remaining parameters in terms of two integers @xmath58 @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we are using the notation here that @xmath62 and @xmath63 . without loss of generality",
    ", one assumes @xmath64 which implies @xmath65 .",
    "we also note here that the special case @xmath4 corresponds to supersymmetric solutions .",
    "this leaves a five - parameter family of smooth solitonic solutions .",
    "we can think of the independent parameters as the d1-brane and d5-brane charges , @xmath66 ; the ( asymptotic ) radius of the @xmath56-circle , @xmath50 ; and the two integers , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which fix the remaining physical parameters as @xcite @xmath67 of course , depending on the specific application , it may be more appropriate and/or simpler to describe the solutions using a different set of quantities . in our case ,",
    "when we make explicit calculations of the ergoregion instability , we will fix the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "as we are interested in non - supersymmetric backgrounds , we also impose @xmath71 . to conclude our discussion of notation , we add that the roots of @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , will also appear in the following but they are determined by @xmath47 and the spin parameters  see eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) of @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient producing the instability in the solutions is the existence of an ergoregion . to verify the presence of the ergoregion",
    ", one takes as usual the norm of the killing vector @xmath75 and using eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) of @xcite , calculates @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath75 becomes space - like for @xmath80 and thus an ergosphere appears at @xmath81 .",
    "an inspection of the metric also allows one to conclude the geometry rotates along @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 since @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the supersymmetric limit of the solitons corresponds to take the limit @xmath85 and @xmath86 , while keeping the other parameters fixed , including the conserved charges @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "so , in the supersymmetric limit the norm becomes @xmath88 , which is always negative and thus the ergoregion is not present .",
    "now consider the klein - gordon equation for a massless scalar field propagating in the geometries , @xmath89 implicitly , we are using the string - frame metric in which case one can think of eq .",
    "( [ klein ] ) as the linearized equation of motion for the ramond - ramond scalar .",

    "again , we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed account of the quantities appearing above",

    "the problem at hand consists of two coupled second order differential equations : given some boundary conditions , one has to compute _ simultaneously _ both values of @xmath6 and @xmath107 that satisfy these boundary conditions .",

    "we shall identify modes of the scalar field that are regular at the origin , represent outgoing waves at infinity and grow with time . in this section ,",
    "we follow the wkb analysis of @xcite and show that it applies to the non - supersymmetric solutions , with the same qualitative conclusions .    to begin , we want to write the radial wave equation in the form of an effective schr@xmath128dinger equation . in order to do so",

    "we also consider @xmath137 modes , which are expected to be the most unstable .",
    "modes with @xmath138 must be similar to modes with @xmath139 for some @xmath108 and these are not unstable . with these choices",
    ", we have @xmath140 instead of working directly with the frequency of the wave , it will be convenient to work with the pattern speed along the @xmath55 direction , which is the angular velocity at which surfaces of constant phase rotate .",
    "this velocity is proportional to @xmath141 where the proportionality constant @xmath142 is always positive .",
    "it is important to compare the sign of the pattern speed along @xmath55 with the sign of the angular velocity of the geometry along @xmath55 defined as usual by , @xmath54 and @xmath56 directions .",

    "@xmath144 where @xmath145 is the kaluza - klein momentum charge .",
    "so , when @xmath146 is negative , the wave is propagating in the same sense as the geometry .",

    "hence our radial equation has been reduced to the schr@xmath14dinger form ( [ schrod 2 ] ) with an interesting potential ( [ factorize t ] ) , which depends on the pattern speed ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "now the problem becomes to tune this potential by adjusting @xmath146 in order that a ` zero - energy ' solution can be found with the appropriate boundary conditions : regular at the origin and outgoing waves at infinity .",

    "the solutions have a real exponential behavior .",

    "let us now summarize some of the features of the ergoregion instability found for the solutions :    \\(i ) the general shape of the wkb potentials @xmath357 are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] for the case in which an instability is present .",
    "the key point is that when the ergoregion is present the bottom of the potential well in @xmath157 reaches negative values .",
    "the unstable modes are those whose pattern speed @xmath146 is negative and approaches the minimum of @xmath157 from above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ) .",
    "thus , they are nearly bound states of the potential well in @xmath157 that can however tunnel out to infinity through @xmath158 .",
    "\\(ii ) the fact that the unstable modes are those with negative phase velocity , @xmath200 , has a clear physical interpretation . as in the discussion of eqs .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ omega ] ) , modes with @xmath200 are those that propagate in the same sense as geometry s rotation @xmath143 .",
    "therefore at infinity these modes carry positive angular momentum ( same sense as @xmath143 ) , as well as positive energy .",
    "hence by conservation of energy and angular momentum , with the onset of the ergoregion instability , the solutions are shedding both energy and angular momentum by an amount that increases exponentially .",
    "\\(iii ) the instability can be quite strong , depending on the particular combination of parameters that define the geometry .",
    "more importantly , the instability is robust , in the sense that it exists for a wide range of parameters .",
    "\\(iv ) with @xmath4 , the solutions are supersymmetric and so must be stable .",
    "it is a consistency check of our analysis then that we find no instability in this case .",
    "as commented in section [ wkb ] , when @xmath4 the potential @xmath157 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ potential susy ] ) , is always positive .",
    "hence there are no negative @xmath146 modes which could intersect the potential well of @xmath157 and the susy geometry is stable as required .    in our analysis",
    ", we have focused on the special case @xmath133 and @xmath330 , to simplify the relevant equations .",
    "in fact , the ergoregion instability persists when either or both of these parameters are nonvanishing .",
    "a discussion of the general situation is given in appendix [ beyond ] .",
    "the result is most simply understood from the point of view of the wkb approach .",
    "then all of the additional contributions to the effective potential ( [ rad eq01 ] ) introduced by a nonvanishing @xmath358 or @xmath259 are suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath359 and so can certainly be neglected in the limit of large @xmath359 .",
    "one can further check that the instability exists over some range even when @xmath359 does not dominate the other two .",
    "one distinguishing feature of @xmath136 is that asymptotically the scalar modes have an effective mass in five dimensions .",
    "in our analysis , this is reflected in the fact that asymptotically @xmath360 and so there is an additional barrier for the modes to tunnel out to infinity .",
    "however , for sufficiently large @xmath359 , such tunnelling is possible .",
    "one other interesting point about the large @xmath359 regime is that unstable modes appear with either sign of @xmath358 and @xmath259 .",
    "hence while for the modes on which we have focussed , the instability is ` powered ' by @xmath361 and results in decreasing this angular momentum , there are unstable modes which may at the same time increase @xmath362 and/or @xmath363 .",
    "adding a mass for the scalar field modifies the potentials @xmath357 in essentially the same way as having nonvanishing @xmath259 .",
    "hence we expect the ergoregion instability will even appear for massive fields , at least in modes with sufficiently large angular momentum . as described in section [ free ] , the arguments given by friedmann @xcite are quite general and so we expect the ergoregion instability to appear for higher spin fields as well .",
    "in particular , we expect the fields of the low energy type iib supergravity will generically experience this instability .",
    "having said that the ergoregion instability is robust , we must also add that it can be suppressed in certain parameter regions .",
    "in particular , one finds that the instability timescale becomes extremely long in the regime where @xmath364 and @xmath365 are much larger than the other scales .",
    "further we add that in the decoupling limit where one isolates an asymptotically ads@xmath366 core @xcite , the ergoregion instability is absent .",
    "the simplest way to understand this result is that the ads@xmath366 core has a globally timelike killing vector @xcite and so there is a ` rotating ' frame where we can define all energies to be positive .",
    "one can also explicitly verify the absence of an ergoregion instability in the core solutions by directly applying the analysis used in this paper to those backgrounds .",
    "the geometries ( both supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric ) also have damped modes , modes ( [ separation ansatz ] ) for which the imaginary part of @xmath6 is negative . as per the wkb analysis , these are modes with positive @xmath146 below the local maximum of @xmath157 that tunnel out to infinity through @xmath157  see fig .",
    "[ fig : potential damped ] .    .",
    ", width=8,height=6 ]    as emphasized previously , we can also find purely bound states ( nonradiative modes ) with @xmath367 . with some fine - tuning",
    ", it may also be possible to find geometries which support bound states with @xmath368 .",
    "these nonradiative modes are described in appendix [ sec : a2 ] .",
    "the typical situation for such modes is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential bound ] . as already noted above when @xmath136 , asymptotically @xmath360 and",
    "so there is a finite potential barrier at infinity .",
    "if this barrier is sufficiently large relative to @xmath369 , bound states can arise .",
    "these bound states can also be negative energy states , as can be seen with the energy integral ( [ canon ] ) .",
    "the absence of such negative energy modes which do not radiate at infinity was central to friedman s general argument for the ergoregion instability .",
    "in @xcite , he did not find any such nonradiative modes because he only considered the massless fields for which there is no potential barrier at infinity .",
    "note , however that the current situation is more complicated because the kk - momentum of the background , as well as the angular momenta , contribute to the presence of an ergoregion .",
    "and @xmath158 when @xmath370 .",
    "these are the purely bound states that are discussed in appendix [ sec : a2 ] .",
    ", width=8,height=6 ]    the appearance of negative energy states in the presence of an ergoregion can be anticipated from a geodesic analysis @xcite . by definition ,",
    "the killing vector @xmath41 , which generates asymptotic time translations , becomes space - like inside the ergosphere .",
    "hence ( time - like or null ) geodesics can have either positive or negative energy , @xmath371 , in this region . however , asymptotically only positive energy ( future - oriented ) geodesics are physical . therefore any negative energy geodesics must be confined to circulate within the ergoregion . of course",
    ", in a black hole background , such geodesics would ` disappear ' behind the event horizon .",
    "however , for horizon - free geometries , such as the solutions , they are stable bound orbits and so it is natural to find bound states in the context of a field theory analysis .",
    "however , the question then becomes whether the analogous modes of the field ` fit ' inside the ergoregion or whether they ` leak ' out to infinity , whether a negative energy bound state or an ergoregion instability results .",
    "a more thorough examination of the bound states shows that the negative energy bound states states are characterized by having @xmath372 while the ergoregion instability is associated with modes where @xmath369 and/or @xmath373 are negative  see appendices [ beyond ] and [ sec : a2 ] .",
    "hence as the geodesic analysis would suggest the negative energy modes have a negative pattern speed or phase velocity , but the kk - momentum modes tend to lead to bound states while the spinning modes are related to instabilities .",
    "the presence of negative energy bound states can also be expected to enhance the decay of these horizon - free geometries .",
    "the analysis of the ergoregion instability ( considered in this paper ) is only at the level of linearized test fields .",
    "generically any theory coupling to gravity will also have nonlinear interactions ( even the free scalar considered here has nonlinear couplings with gravitons ) .",
    "these nonlinear couplings might be expected to lead to processes , where positive energy modes are radiated at infinity while negative energy modes are populated within the ergoregion .",
    "however , one should note that the negative energy modes are exponentially decaying at large radius  see appendix [ sec : a2 ]  while the positive energy modes are power - law suppressed inside the ergoregion .",
    "hence the overlap of these modes is expected to be small , which will suppress this nonlinear contribution to the decay .",
    "we now turn to consider the endpoint of the ergoregion instabilities . as emphasized",
    "before , the presence of these instabilities relies on two key ingredients , namely , the geometry has an ergoregion but it does not have an event horizon .",
    "hence the resulting decay process could be terminated either by the disappearance of the ergoregion or the appearance of a horizon . however , the unstable modes radiate with a positive energy density asymptotically which is compensated for by a negative energy density inside the ergoregion  as could be seen in eq .",
    "( [ canon ] ) .",
    "hence the onset of the ergoregion instability produces a(n exponential ) build - up of negative energy near the core of the solutions .",
    "therefore it seems unlikely that an event horizon will form since the latter is typically associated with a large build - up of positive energy density .",
    "this reasoning then suggests that the decay must terminate with the disappearance of the ergoregion .",
    "the supersymmetric d1-d5-p microstate geometries @xcite are all free of an ergoregion and hence it is natural to suppose that these are at the endpoint of the ergoregion instabilities .",
    "of course , these solutions offer a huge family of possible endpoints and the precise one that forms will depend on the details of the decay process , beyond the linear regime considered here  although as we are only considering the classical evolution , it is in principle possible given a certain set of initial conditions .",
    "of course , we can expect that the final mass should be close to the bps mass determined by the charges of the initial solution , @xmath374 $ ] .",
    "although even here , we can only say ` close ' as we know that the unstable modes with @xmath136 ( and _ either _ sign of @xmath259 ) occur which may modify the final value of @xmath375 . similar comments",
    "apply for the angular momenta , @xmath361 and @xmath376 .",
    "we also observe that there is no reason to expect that the decay process will lead to an endpoint within the family of supersymmetric solutions .",
    "of course , at the level of the present discussion , we can not rule out that the endpoint is only a nearly supersymmetric solution ( or that this would be the effective endpoint ) .",
    "our expectation is that such solutions will have a ` small ' ergoregion and that the instability might be eliminated ( or strongly suppressed ) before the ergoregion precisely vanishes .",
    ", however , if the ergoregion instability sheds the background angular momentum efficiently then the system will evolve to a regime where black holes can form .",
    "hence we can not rule out the appearance of an event horizon  we thank simon ross for correspondence on this point . ]",
    "the stability analysis of the solitons @xcite is relevant for the stringy tachyon decays discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "originally , @xcite considered tachyon condensation in certain d1-d5 black string backgrounds where tachyonic string winding modes can occur if one chooses antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions around the circle on which the black string is compactified .",
    "the latter choice necessarily restricts the scenario to a non - supersymmetric sector of string theory which already suffers from various instabilities @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered adding angular momentum to the black strings . in this case , it was shown that string modes winding certain compact circles near the horizon can be tachyonic even when the asymptotic fermion boundary conditions are supersymmetric .",
    "the relevant point for the present discussion is that the endpoint of the tachyon condensation is in general one of the non - supersymmetric solitons .",
    "now , in this paper , we have shown that these solitons are themselves unstable and so they will not be the final endpoint of these decays . instead , the ergoregion instability will continue the decay process and as suggested above , will likely terminate with a supersymmetric microstate geometry .",
    "we would now like to consider the implications of ergoregion instabilities for mathur s fuzzball program of describing black holes in terms of an ensemble of microstate geometries .",
    "if this program is to succeed it must supply a description of both supersymmetric and also non - supersymmetric black holes . at first sight",
    ", it may appear that constructing non - bps microstate geometries is not possible .",
    "in particular , non - bps states will decay and so it is not clear that there should be stationary geometries to describe them .",
    "however , the solutions provide an explicit example indicating that this is not really a problem .",
    "in fact , the decay of non - bps microstates was already considered in the d - brane description of nonextremal black holes @xcite . in that context , it was seen as a success of the string theoretic approach as this instability had an interpretation in terms of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "of course , hawking radiation is a quantum effect in the black hole background and so presents no obstacle to the construction of classical supergravity solutions which are static or stationary .",
    "it is perhaps useful to remind ourselves as to how this distinction arises .",
    "the classical limit can be understood as the limit where the string coupling @xmath377 is vanishingly small @xcite .",
    "however , the interesting classical solutions are those which correspond to states where the various quantum numbers are extremely large .",
    "that is , @xmath378 and @xmath379 while @xmath380 .",
    "these scalings are chosen to ensure that the gravitational ` footprint ' , @xmath364 , @xmath365 , @xmath375 , @xmath381 and @xmath382 , associated with each of these quantum numbers remains finite . however , in this limit , the adm energy of the system diverges with @xmath383 .",
    "as the energy is a dimensionful quantity , this can be accommodated by changing the units with which energies are measured in the classical limit .",
    "essentially this divergence is associated with the divergence of the planck mass , which does not serve as a useful reference scale in classical gravity .",
    "now the decay rate of the nonextremal d1-d5-p black holes can be computed in a straightforward manner @xcite .",
    "the key point , however , is that the final expression for @xmath384 is expressed in terms of geometric quantities and is independent of @xmath377 .",
    "therefore in the classical limit , the rate of energy loss remains finite in stringy units but becomes vanishingly small when measured against the fiducial energy scale that was established for classical physics .",
    "hence the non - bps black holes become stable in the classical regime .",
    "we note that the ` straightforward ' calculations of the decay rate referred to above can be performed either in the framework of a microscopic d - brane perspective or of the gravitational perspective of hawking radiation .",
    "the suprising result is that the results of both analyses agree precisely @xcite , including greybody factors , at least in the so - called ` dilute gas ' approximation @xcite .",
    "however , even though suggestive arguments can be made in this regime @xcite , this remarkable agreement remains poorly understood .",
    "as the solutions are horizon - free , the gravitational calculation of the decay rate would have to be modified . using the connection between absorption and emission rates ,",
    "it is possible that absorption calculations along the lines of those presented in @xcite could be extended to yield the desired decay rate . on the other hand ,",
    "the underlying microscopic states for the solutions were already identified in @xcite .",
    "hence one can use microscopic techniques to estimate the decay rate expected for these solutions .",
    "the result is @xmath385 and again this quantity remains finite as @xmath380 .",
    "therefore we can again ignore this decay channel for the classical solutions .    however , the ergoregion instability investigated in this paper is a classical instability and so should not be associated with the decay discussed above .",
    "we should also note that the form of these two instabilities differs . above one is considering the spontaneous decay of the system while the classical instability really corresponds to a decay that results when the initial data does not precisely match that of the solutions . of course , in the quantum regime , the same modes associated with the ergoregion instability will give rise to spontaneous decay due to quantum fluctuations of the background .",
    "core to argue that such emissions would not occur .",
    "] however , the latter will again be suppressed in the @xmath380 limit .",
    "this reflects the fact that the background can be prepared with arbitrarily accurate precision in the classical limit and so it should be possible to produce an arbitrary suppression of ergoregion instability . alternatively , working in the classical limit , we can regard the ergoregion instability as a property of how the solutions interact with external sources .",
    "that is , generically if an external wave packet impinges on one of the non - supersymmetric configurations , it will produce a dramatic decay of the original background .",
    "hence this instability seems to present a major challenge for the fuzzball description of black holes .",
    "we have argued that the ergoregion instability is a robust feature of the non - supersymmetric solutions over a wide range of parameters .",
    "given general arguments along the lines of @xcite , we also expect that this instability will be a generic feature of any smooth horizon - free geometries which describe microstates which are non - bps and carry significant angular momentum ( and hence have a macroscopic ergoregion ) .",
    "therefore if a nonextremal d1-d5-p black hole is to be described by a coarse - grained ensemble fuzzball , it seems that that the classical black holes must suffer from an analogous instability .",
    "while the presence of an event horizon eliminates the possibility of an explicit ergoregion instability , there are , in fact , a number of potential instabilities which might afflict these black holes and possibly reproduce the same physics :    * a ) superradiant instability * : spinning nonextremal black holes will exhibit superradiant scattering , where an incident wave packet can be reflected with a stronger amplitude .",
    "superradiance by itself does not provide a classical instability , but an instability can arise if the scattered modes are reflected back to rescatter , as described in section [ general ] .",
    "this scattering was considered for higher dimensional spinning black branes @xcite and there it was found that when the noncompact space has more than four dimensions , this instability does not arise . explicitly analyzing the present d1-d5-p black string again seems to indicate the absence of an instability @xcite .    *",
    "b ) gyration instability * : considering supersymmetric d1-d5-p black strings , it was found that above a certain critical angular momentum a straight black string is unstable towards carrying the angular momentum in gyrations of the horizon @xcite .",
    "this instability should also appear in non - supersymmetric configurations and so would present an instability at large values of the angular momentum .    * c ) gregory - laflamme instability * : the relevant configurations are black strings and so are expected to suffer from the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite in two ways .",
    "the first is the usual instability of long wavelength modes along the string .",
    "of course , this instability can be eliminated by reducing the radius of the compactification along the string . for a fixed radius ,",
    "it is also suppressed by the boosting along this direction which induces the kk - momentum @xcite .",
    "this instability is not related to the angular momentum carried by the black string or the presence of an ergoregion , but we list it here for completeness .    * d ) ultra - spin instability * : in six or higher spacetime dimensions , one can find black hole solutions with an arbitrarily large spin per unit mass @xcite .",
    "however , it was argued @xcite that a gregory - laflamme - like instability will arise to dynamically enforce a kerr - like bound in these cases .",
    "while this analysis does not directly apply in five dimensions , entropy arguments suggest an analogous instability still exists and will lead to the formation of a black ring if the angular momentum is too large @xcite .    while there are several possibilities for instabilities of a black string in six dimensions",
    ", it seems that none of these can reproduce the physics of the ergoregion instability which will afflict the non - bps microstate geometries .",
    "this observation relies on the fact that these instabilities have a different character at a very basic level .",
    "the ergoregion instability might be termed a radiative instability , in that , the instability is by definition connected to modes that radiate at infinity .",
    "in contrast , the four instabilities considered above for black strings can be termed internal instabilities .",
    "that is , these instabilities are primarily associated with a rearrangement of the internal or near - horizon structure of the black string . while these instabilities will be accompanied with some radiation at infinity",
    ", this will be a secondary effect with these instabilities .",
    "therefore it seems that emulating the ergoregion instability in a nonextremal black string background will require the discovery of a new kind of instability . while we are performing a detailed analysis of the nonextremal d1-d5-p black string ,",
    "our preliminary results indicate that no such instability arises @xcite .",
    "we also note in passing that at the same time the microstate geometries should be able to emulate any instabilities found in the black string backgrounds .",
    "in particular , the gregory - laflamme instability is a robust instability that will afflict these backgrounds for sufficiently large @xmath50 . in the microstate geometries",
    ", one should then find unstable modes carrying kk - momentum which are confined near the core of the soliton .",
    "we have studied bound states for a test field in the solutions , as described in appendix [ sec : a2 ] .",
    "while the modes we identified only arise for nonvanishing kk - momentum as desired , they are all stable , they have real frequencies .",
    "hence they can not serve as the analog of the gregory - laflamme instability in the non - supersymmetric solutions .",
    "however , the latter would be a gravitational instability , it should not be expected to appear as a scalar test field , and so this question requires further investigation .",
    "a possible reconciliation of these ideas with the fuzzball proposal would be that the microstate geometries could provide an accurate description of a black hole but only over a long but finite time . in the context of the ads@xmath366/cft@xmath386 duality",
    ", some evidence for such a picture has recently been found @xcite . with this new point of view",
    ", a key question is to determine the timescale over which microstate geometries can not be distinguished from black holes .",
    "one suggestion @xcite is that it should be of the order of the recurrence time , which would be exponential in the relevant quantum numbers .",
    "an alternative suggestion might be that the timescale is associated with hawking evaporation which would involve ( inverse ) powers of the quantum numbers .",
    "however , note that both of these suggestions diverge in the classical limit .",
    "hence the ergoregion instability found here seems to be in conflict with both of these suggestions . while the instability timescale is certainly very long in certain parameter regimes , it is a classical timescale , it is finite in the classical limit .",
    "hence our results would suggest that spinning microstate geometries and black holes should be distinguishable on a large but classically finite timescale .",
    "however , one must ask how characteristic our results for the solutions will be of generic microstate geometries .",
    "in particular , we note that the cft states corresponding to the solutions are exclusively in the untwisted sector @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the majority of microstates accounting for the entropy of the black strings are expected to be in a ( maximally ) twisted sector @xcite . from a geometric point of view",
    ", we would observe that the solutions have all the same killing symmetries as the d1-d5-p black holes , while the generic microstate geometry is expected to have a complex nonsymmetric core .",
    "therefore it is not unreasonable to expect that the ergoregion instability timescales found for the solutions will not be characteristic of the microstate geometries that make up ` most ' of the black hole .",
    "one possibility might be the generic non - bps geometries do not have ergoregions despite the fact that they carry angular momentum .",
    "however , we argue that such a scenario is implausible as follows : the fuzzball description would now require that both the horizon and the ergosphere arise as effective surfaces in ` coarse - graining ' .",
    "however , quantum fluctuations must then extend out to the ergosphere .",
    "in particular , these fluctuations extend to regions of the spacetime which should be causally accessible to asymptotic observers on finite classical timescales .",
    "hence it seems inconsistent to say that the underlying microstate geometries are hidden from asymptotic observers in this scenario .",
    "hence as argued above , if the non - bps microstate geometries are horizon - free with an ergoregion , they should expect an ergoregion instability .",
    "however , it may be that instability timescales calculated for the solutions are not representative of those for typical microstate spacetimes .",
    "in particular , the latter should have complicated throats  as seen in their supersymmetric counterparts @xcite  which would emulate the absorptive behavior of a black hole horizon .",
    "hence it might be expected that the relevant timescales are extremely long .",
    "an important question is then whether the instability timescale is classically finite or not .",
    "that is , will this timescale diverge as the quantum numbers grow as described above . certainly finding more generic non - bps microstate geometries",
    "is an essential step towards resolving this issue .    in closing",
    ", we note that in the context of the ads / cft , a complete description has been produced for half - bps microstate geometries with ads@xmath387 @xcite and ads@xmath366 @xcite asymptotics .",
    "this framework has given rise to an interesting program of semi - classical quantization @xcite and a coarse - graining description of spacetime geometry @xcite .",
    "with this program in mind , it is useful to recall the role of the smooth horizon - free microstate geometries in mathur s ` fuzzball ' program @xcite .",
    "the bps microstate geometries for the d1-d5 system can be derived by studying the f1-p geometries and applying a series of duality transformations @xcite . there",
    "the winding and wave numbers might be quantized by the geometry but classically the amplitudes of the string excitations are continuous variables .",
    "solutions where select modes are excited with a large amplitude can then be seen as ` coherent states ' of the underlying quantum theory .",

    "the last two bracketed terms in the final line are positive , so a solution requires that @xmath425 , implying that @xmath359 must be positive .",

    "when @xmath327 is largest , the timescale will be shortest , therefore the lowest harmonic @xmath238 will lead to the strongest instability .",
    "one can also make @xmath327 large by choosing @xmath359 and @xmath358 as large as large as possible , @xmath428 , but taking @xmath108 large will not necessarily give us a very unstable mode because as noted before it will cause @xmath328 to rise which has an opposing effect . since @xmath415 enters weighted by @xmath416 , the more important contribution will be that from @xmath328 and the net effect is a less unstable mode .",
    "finally , note that @xmath358 and @xmath359 appear symmetrically in @xmath327 , so that the value of @xmath119 will be independent of the partition of @xmath108 into @xmath358 and @xmath359 .",
    "this does not mean that the timescale will be independent of this partition since it is a weakly shrinking function of @xmath304 for fixed @xmath119 .",
    "when @xmath304 is maximized the timescale will be the shortest , which is the case when @xmath429 , @xmath330 .    to summarize then , for a fixed mode that solves the constraints , the instability will be strongest when @xmath417 .",
    "on the other hand , when we fix a particular background , the instability with @xmath133 will be strongest when @xmath337 is as small as possible and @xmath330 .",
    "finally then we may discuss the solutions for which @xmath430 .",
    "it turns out that the various scalings of the other parameters appears not to be changed .",
    "when @xmath319 , the constraint @xmath431 becomes easier to satisfy since @xmath327 picks up a contribution proportional to @xmath432 while the contribution to @xmath328 is smaller .",
    "the tougher constraint to satisfy is then the one that implies @xmath433 . when all other parameters are fixed , this places upper and lower bounds on ( we allow negative @xmath259 ) @xmath259 .",
    "we will not go into detail here , but instead note one can always find solutions with non - zero @xmath259 by going to sufficiently large angular momentum , @xmath108 .",
    "when studying the characteristic time for the instabilities , one finds that the timescale decreases as @xmath259 is raised , but reaches a maximum shortly before reaching the upper bound . for negative values ,",
    "on the other hand , the timescale is a constant decreasing function of @xmath259 .",
    "as mentioned , solutions with non - zero @xmath259 require larger values of @xmath108 than when @xmath133",
    ". though larger @xmath108 tends to increase the timescale , the overall effect of going to larger @xmath108 to accommodate non - zero @xmath259 can still lead to shorter timescales .",
    "the general radial dependence of the scalar field at large distances from the core is determined by the sign of @xmath102 .",
    "when it is positive , the general solution oscillates with a power - law falloff .",
    "this is the behavior that led to the in and outgoing waves at infinity which we have already discussed .",
    "the other two possibilities , where @xmath434 is zero or negative , can lead to quite different behavior . for the former",
    "there is an exact solution , while the latter may again be solved with a matched expansion .      by considering the special mode with @xmath436 , both the angular and radial equations",
    "simplify sufficiently that an exact solution may be found .",
    "such a choice removes all @xmath6 dependence from the angular equation allowing it to be solved independently .",
    "the result is the eigenvalue equation for the harmonics on an @xmath437 .",
    "the exact eigenvalue is @xmath111 .    for the radial equation ,",
    "this choice of mode removes the @xmath438 term ; the same condition that previously led to the simplification in the near region .",
    "the previous solution in the near region ( [ hypergeometric solution ] ) therefore becomes the exact solution in the entire spacetime .",
    "this means that asymptotically the equation has a basis of solutions in terms of @xmath439 .",
    "ignoring for now the part dependent on the kk momentum , these become @xmath440 and @xmath441 .",
    "these are simply the terms one expects from a laplace series in four flat spatial dimensions where the angular momentum creates an effective radial potential .",
    "asymptotic regularity requires that the @xmath442 component vanish whenever @xmath443 , leaving a field that falls off as @xmath444 .",
    "the natural generalization of friedmann s analysis of ergoregion instabilities to five - dimensions would involve studying fields that fall off as @xmath445 , therefore these modes will evade that analysis as long as @xmath443 . the requirement that removes the divergent term is similar to that for outgoing modes , except",
    "now it is an exact result @xmath446 where @xmath206 is a non - negative integer . here",
    ", however , we allow for either of the @xmath293 functions in the denominator to diverge in eq .",
    "( [ near field large r ] ) , leading to both possibilities for the sign before @xmath290 .",
    "this is in contrast to the search for unstables modes in which we could neglect one of the possibilities since it was found to corresponded to ingoing damped modes . indeed , since ( [ eq : mbound - state - quantized ] ) contains terms linear in both @xmath259 and @xmath6 , one must consider both signs above in order to be consistent with the symmetry under flipping signs as in equation ( [ symmetry ] ) .    in total",
    "then we have three constraints that must be satisfied for these modes .",
    "the first , @xmath436 , fixes @xmath6 to be an integer , meaning that there are no remaining continuous parameters characterizing the scalar field . for a general background",
    "then it is unlikely that the remaining constraints , in particular the one defining @xmath206 , can be solved by a judicious choice of the integer eigenvalues . on the other hand ,",
    "fixing the set @xmath447 and @xmath259 , there may be families of backgrounds for which these marginally bound states exist .",
    "the final possibility for solutions of the radial equation is @xmath449 , or @xmath450 . as in the case where @xmath434 is positive , we are unable to find an exact solution , though progress can be made through approximation . in particular ,",
    "since the effect of the sign of @xmath283 is only relevant at large distances from the core , we need only make slight modifications to the matched asymptotic expansion analysis presented earlier .",
    "to begin , we factor out the sign of @xmath434 by redefining @xmath451 , giving solutions that are real valued exponentials asymptotically . requiring regularity therefore leaves only the exponentially damped `` bound states '' , localized near the core region .",
    "explicitly , after having made the redefinition in ( [ far wave eq ] ) , a convenient basis of solutions is in terms of modified bessel functions of the first and second kind .",
    "@xmath452 \\label{eq : hout_solution } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first of these diverges at large @xmath104 and so we require @xmath453 for regularity . for now though , we leave @xmath454 arbitrary , setting it to vanish only after we have performed the matching .    in the matching region",
    "expanding @xmath455 and @xmath456 in the @xmath457 basis gives @xmath458 \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : hout_overlap}\\ ] ] note that @xmath456 contains both of these powers of @xmath104 when expanded in the overlap region .",
    "while the contribution of the positive power to @xmath456 is relatively small , we will keep this contribution until after we perform the matching so that we may see how the approximate solution comes about .    by construction , the solution in the near region ( [ hypergeometric solution ] ) is unaffected by the redefinition of @xmath283 . immediately",
    "then we may proceed to matching the coefficients on powers of @xmath104 in the overlap region . setting @xmath459 in the near region solution ,",
    "we determine the coefficients @xmath460 in the outer region @xmath461 as before , finding the spectrum of solutions now requires that we find values of the free parameters for which these equations are consistent with the boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , we now set @xmath453 and therefore ask that the right hand side of ( [ eq : c1-eq ] ) vanishes .",
    "again , rather than find such parameters numerically there is an accurate approximation that comes from noting that consistency requires @xmath462 be non - zero .",
    "this implies that the second term in ( [ eq : c1-eq ] ) must be non - zero and therefore any solution must come from cancellation between the two terms .",
    "since the second term is suppressed by the factor @xmath463 , a comparable suppression must occur in the first term , again requiring the divergence of a @xmath293 function in the denominator .",
    "this gives a quantization condition similar to that found previously @xmath464 here again , the terms linear in @xmath6 and @xmath259 implicit in the above equation  see definitions in eq .",
    "( [ rad eq parameters0 ] )  imply that both possibilities are required for consistency with the symmetry ( [ symmetry ] ) , though in practice both may not lead to solutions for which @xmath449 .",
    "when @xmath119 is real , this appears to give solutions for @xmath6 which are purely real .",
    "note , however , we must be careful in solving the constraint since , given the right combination of background charges , @xmath465 could become negative .",
    "for an arbitrary frequency in this range ,",
    "( [ eq : c1-eq ] ) will be complex so solutions where @xmath6 has both real and imaginary parts may be possible .",
    "such solutions can not be found with the sort of perturbative expansion used in studying the outgoing modes since now it is the real part of @xmath119 which gains a small correction , while the imaginary part is large .",
    "we can therefore no longer consider the behavior near the pole on the negative real axis defined by the real part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound - state - quantized ] ) . instead",
    ", we have resorted to searching for these solutions by solving ( [ eq : c1-eq ] ) numerically .",
    "generically , the root finding algorithm will produce a complex value of @xmath6 that sets the equation to zero within a specified precision . since the imaginary part is many orders of magnitude smaller than the real part one should ensure that it really is non - zero and not a numerical artifact . in figure",
    "[ fig : unstable_bs ] we show the variation in the size of the imaginary part as a function of the tolerance used in finding the root of ( [ eq : c1-eq ] ) . from this plot",
    "we see that the imaginary contribution is indeed just an artifact of trying to solve the complex equation .",
    "surprisingly then it appears we can satisfy ( [ eq : c1-eq ] ) with a real value of @xmath6 , even if that value causes @xmath466 .",
    "that value corresponds to the solution of the equation resulting from taking the real part of the quantization conditions ( [ eq : bound - state - quantized ] ) .",
    "since the condition ( [ eq : bound - state - quantized ] ) is the same as for the outgoing modes , much of the analysis in appendix [ beyond ] about the existence of solutions applies .",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated in that one now allows modes with positive @xmath6 and there are two possible solutions corresponding to the two signs in ( [ eq : bound - state - quantized ] ) , but the general characteristics of the solutions are the same . in particular , for the outgoing modes it was found that there are upper and lower bounds on the allowable values of @xmath259 beyond which @xmath467 changes sign . in light of these bound states",
    ", we see that the full space of solutions may be considered as split into distinct regions based on the value of @xmath259 .",
    "there is a small-@xmath468 regime , in which one finds the outgoing unstable modes .",
    "this is surrounded , at larger values of @xmath468 , by a regime where the bound states arise .",
    "this separation of the two types of modes according to the parameter @xmath259 makes clear the difference in their origin .",
    "in particular , one can always find outgoing unstable modes that do not carry kk momentum , they need only be supplied with sufficient angular momentum .",
    "this is in accord with our interpretation of these solutions as the unstable modes predicted by friedman which result from the existence of the ergoregion . in contrast , bound states will always result as long as @xmath468 is large enough .",
    "this includes modes which carry no angular momentum , thus indicating the important characteristic of these solutions is their kk momentum and the effective five - dimensional mass it induces .",
    "having established the existence of these bound states we should question just how close to the core region they are bound .",
    "the solutions are damped exponentially and so have characteristic size @xmath469 to arrive at the final line we have used the approximation for @xmath47 ( [ m_approx ] ) found in appendix [ beyond ] .",
    "the boundary of the ergoregion , on the other hand , is given by the vanishing of the norm of the killing vector @xmath470 ( [ ergoregionv ] ) .",
    "we ignore the @xmath48 dependent contributions appearing in @xmath471 to give an outer bound on the size of the ergoregion , given approximately by @xmath472 . in terms of the variable @xmath104",
    "this means @xmath473    whenever @xmath364 and @xmath365 are much smaller than @xmath314 , the size of the bound state scales as @xmath474 .",
    "on the other hand , for large @xmath364 and @xmath365 we have @xmath475 where @xmath476 is the smaller of the two .",
    "in other words , the size of the bound state is strongly dependent on the background . when the charges are large , the bound state will be mostly contained within the ergoregion , while for small charges the exponential tail of the bound state can extend far outside .",
    "finally we can consider the possibility that the bound states have negative energy , which requires a detailed analysis of the energy integral ( [ canon ] ) .",
    "examining the integrand evaluated on bound state solutions , we see that it may become negative near where the modulus of the scalar field peaks if the latter occurs inside the ergoregion .",
    "though there are bound states for arbitrarily large values of @xmath468 , the total energy will not be negative for all of these .",
    "instead , the modes that tend to exhibit negative energy densities ( in the ergoregion ) only appear for a limited range of @xmath468 , which is just beyond the small-@xmath468 regime discussed above .",
    "that is , for values of @xmath259 near where the ergoregion instability appears .",
    "when this is the case , the maximum of the modulus of the scalar field is inside the ergoregion and the phase velocity in the compactified direction @xmath477 is negative , in the direction opposite to which the background is boosted .",
