    "in this paper we report the discovery of a new planetary nebula ( pn ) in cassiopeia .",
    "the pn appears nearly perfectly elliptical , and its central star is a late - type star with enhanced abundances of carbon and _ s_-processelements .",
    "the system thus appears to represent the immediate aftermath of the formation of a barium star . in the following sections we present the serendipitous discovery of the nebula , the classification of the nucleus as a  star , a study of the star s photometric properties and variability , estimates of the distance to the system , and an evolutionary scenario for the origin of this remarkable object .",
    "we conclude with suggestions for follow - up studies .",
    "in 1995 , one of us ( r.f.w . ) discovered an unusual nebulous object while verifying the coordinates of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 , a well - known stellar x - ray source . the digitized sky survey ( dss )",
    "was used to generate an image of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 . during examination of the source and its surrounding field , r.f.w . noticed a faint , elliptical nebula surrounding a 14th - mag star , lying @xmath1 to the southwest of ( and unrelated to ) ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 .",
    "subsequently obtained narrow - band ccd images of the object , with the 0.9-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) in autumn 1996 , and later with the kpno mayall 4-m telescope as described below .",
    "filters isolating [ ] 5007    and h@xmath2 + [ ] 6584    showed the object to be a previously unrecognized303 , and confirmed it optically using the dss ; they suggested that it is a small region . ]",
    "the name webo  1 was proposed by bond , ciardullo , & webbink ( 1996 ) , and will be used here . in the nomenclature of the _ strasbourg - eso catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae _ ( acker et  al .",
    "1992 ) , which is based on galactic coordinates , the object s designation would be pn  g135.6 + 01.0 . the central star is listed in the usno - a2.0 catalog at the j2000 coordinates given below in table  1 .",
    "unusually for a pn nucleus , the star appears to be quite red : the usno - a2.0 approximate photographic @xmath3 and @xmath4 magnitudes are 16.0 and 14.4 , respectively .",
    "our best narrow - band images of webo  1 were obtained by h.e.b . on 1999 january 16 with the kpno 4-m telescope and its mosaic ccd camera .",
    "the [ ] and h@xmath2 + [ ] images are shown in figs .",
    "1a and 1b , respectively .",
    "the frames were taken through cirrus clouds , but under good seeing conditions : the fwhm of stellar images in [ ] and in h@xmath2 + [ ] was @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .    in h@xmath2 + [ ] , webo  1 has a striking morphology , appearing as a nearly perfect ellipse with major and minor axes of about @xmath7 .",
    "the shape strongly suggests that the pn is a thin circular ring with a very low ratio of height to radius , viewed at an inclination of @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "such a morphology is nearly unique among pne , matched only by the southern - hemisphere pn suwt  2 , which has a nearly identical appearance ( schuster & west 1976 ; bond , exter , & pollacco 2001 ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 + [ ] ring has a generally clumpy appearance , a bright , sharp inner rim , and is brightest at the two ends of its major axis ( perhaps simply a path - length effect ) .",
    "the interior of the ring is almost hollow , although the brightness level is brighter than the surroundings ( which are overlain with diffuse h@xmath2 emission at this low galactic latitude ) .    in [ ]",
    "the pn appears more diffuse , but the ring is still apparent . unlike the h@xmath2 + [ ] image ,",
    "the interior of the ring is not hollow .",
    "the images suggest a gradient in ionization level , with the interior of the pn filled with high - ionization material radiating in [ ] , surrounded by cooler material around the periphery of the ring emitting strongly in ( presumably ) [ ] .",
    "images through filters that separate h@xmath2 and [ ] would shed further light on the morphology of webo  1 .",
    "a ccd spectrogram of the central star of webo1 was obtained by d.l.p . at the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope at la palma , canary islands , on 1997",
    "january 12 .",
    "the intermediate dispersion spectrograph was used at a dispersion of 35.3    mm@xmath10 .",
    "the spectral coverage was 980   , at a resolution of 1.6   , and the exposure was 1800s .",
    "2 shows the spectrum . to our surprise , the star is cool and chemically peculiar .",
    "molecular bands of c@xmath11 , ch , and cn are prominent , and the lines of  at 4077    and  at 4554    are extremely strong . remarkably , the core of the  h line is filled by very strong emission .",
    "(  k is , unfortunately , just outside the spectral range that we covered . )",
    "the star thus has all of the properties of a classical barium star ( or `` star '' ) .",
    "stars were first identified as a spectroscopic class by bidelman & keenan ( 1951 ) .",
    "they show enhanced abundances of carbon and of heavy elements produced by _",
    "s_-process  neutron - capture reactions .",
    "the modern view of  stars ( see mcclure 1984 ; jorissen et  al .",
    "1998 ; bond & sion 2001 ) is that they are the binary companions of more massive stars that became asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) stars , dredged up c and _",
    "s_-process  elements from their interiors , and transferred them to the companions .",
    "the agb stars have now become optically invisible white dwarfs , leaving the contaminated companions as the visible  stars .",
    "we classified the spectrum of webo  1 by displaying it as a `` photographic '' spectrogram , and comparing it visually with the atlas of keenan & mcneil ( 1976 ) . to estimate the  strength , which classically ( warner 1965 ) is on a scale from 1 ( slightly enhanced over normal ) to 5 ( extremely strong ) , we compared our spectrum with the sequence illustrated by l et  al.(1983 , their fig .  2 ) .",
    "the resulting classification is k0  iii : p  ba5 .",
    "the luminosity class is essentially indeterminate from our material ( due to the abnormal strength of all of the luminosity indicators at this resolution ) , and the `` p '' refers to the presence of c@xmath11 bands , which are generally seen only in a subset of the  stars , as well as to the  emission .",
    "ccd _ bvi _ photometry of the nucleus was obtained by h.e.b . on six occasions on four different photometric nights in 1996 and 1997 september .",
    "the kpno 0.9-m reflector was used with a tektronix ccd , and the photometry was reduced to the johnson - kron - cousins _ bvi _ system through observations of landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars .",
    "two nearby stars were chosen as comparison stars for a variability study ( see below ) and were also calibrated to the _ bvi _ system .",
    "results are given in table  1 .",
    "the errors , determined from the internal scatter among the six different measurements , are @xmath120.01  mag in @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and @xmath120.02  mag in @xmath15 .",
    "the central star of webo  1 , at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , is very red for its spectral type ; a normal k0  iii star has @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( bessell 1979 ) .",
    "the star thus appears to have an interstellar reddening of @xmath20 , corresponding to @xmath21 ( using the formula of dean , warren , & cousins 1978 ) .",
    "the intrinsic color is @xmath22 , suggesting that the star is somewhat redder in @xmath14 than a normal k0 giant because of its strong carbon bands as well as the influence of the broad bond - neff ( 1969 ) flux depression around 4000    that is seen in barium stars .    given that the optically visible star in webo  1 is very cool , we can speculate that it is a member of a binary system with a much hotter , but optically inconspicuous , companion that is responsible for the ionization of the pn .      in order to search for variability , h.e.b .",
    "obtained ccd images in _ bvi _ on 40 occasions spread over 6 nights each in 1996 and 1997",
    "september , 4 in 1998 march , and 2 in 1999 january .",
    "the 0.9-m kpno telescope was used , as described above . since several of these nights were non - photometric , we calculated differential magnitudes between webo  1 and the sum of the intensities of the two comparison stars .",
    "the central star is definitely variable , but at a low level .",
    "we searched the data for periodic variations , using the lafler - kinman ( 1965 ) algorithm .",
    "the smoothest light curves are obtained for a period of 4.686  days .",
    "however , the nearby alias periods at 4.347 and 5.074  days also give plausible light curves , so we can not make a definitive claim that 4.686  days is the correct period .",
    "it is even possible to fit the data with a sub - day alias near 0.82  days , but with significantly larger photometric scatter .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the differential magnitude and color curves for the adopted ephemeris @xmath23 . to estimate the uncertainties , we calculated the standard deviations of the comparison star 1 minus comparison star 2 magnitudes , which are 0.011 , 0.007 , and 0.008  mag in @xmath3 , @xmath13 , and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the radii of the plotted points in fig .  3",
    "were then set to these values ( with the errors combined in quadrature for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the webo  1 nucleus shows a nearly sinusoidal variation in all three filters , with a peak - to - peak amplitude of about 0.03  mag .",
    "there are no significant changes in color .",
    "we can identify four mechanisms that could produce this variation : ( 1 )  pulsation , ( 2 )  heating ( reflection ) effects in a close binary , ( 3 )  ellipsoidal variations ( at a period of @xmath25 days ) , and ( 4 )  starspots on a rotating star .",
    "pulsation appears unlikely because of the lack of any color variations .",
    "for a planetary - nucleus cooling age comparable to the estimated expansion age of the nebula ( see below ) , we estimate its luminosity should exceed @xmath26 , in which case heating of the facing hemisphere of the ba star in a 4.7-day binary would produce a reflection effect nearly two orders of magnitude larger than the observed photometric amplitude ( unless the binary is seen nearly pole - on ) , with colors decidedly bluer than observed .",
    "the reflection effect should also dominate ellipsoidal variability at all inclinations , unless the barium companion is not the ionization source for the pn .",
    "we consider starspots the most likely explanation , in which case 4.7  days is the stellar rotation period .",
    "the strong  emission indicates that the star is very chromospherically active , supporting the starspot interpretation and suggesting that the activity is dynamo - driven by the relatively rapid rotation .",
    "we can constrain the distance to webo  1 using three different methods . the first one uses the estimated interstellar reddening of @xmath27 and the three - dimensional extinction model of arenou , grenon , & gmez ( 1992 ) . the observed reddening is close to the asymptotic limit at large distances in this region of the sky , but the arenou et al .",
    "model allows us to set a 1@xmath28 lower limit on the distance of 0.75  kpc , a result which is in excellent accord with the extinction maps of neckel & klare ( 1980 ) .    an upper limit to the distance of webo  1 follows from equating the 4.7-day photometric period with the rotational breakup period of the barium star . assuming a mass of @xmath29 for that star ( jorissen et al .",
    "1998 ) , we find that its radius can not exceed @xmath30 . the observed magnitude and reddening",
    "then imply that a k0  iii star of this radius must be no farther than 2.4  kpc .",
    "a third method uses a statistical distance scale for pne .",
    "there are several of these in the literature , but we have chosen that of cahn , kaler , & stanghellini ( 1992 , hereafter cks ) .",
    "ciardullo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have shown the cks formalism to produce reasonably good agreement with pne of known distance , albeit with the factor - of - two scatter typical of all statistical pn distance scales . adopting the 6  cm flux density of 4.4  mjy given by martet al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and an angular radius of @xmath31 , we use the cks method to yield a distance estimate of 2.2  kpc .",
    "we adopt a nominal distance of @xmath32  kpc ( the approximate mean and range defined by the lower and upper limits ) . at this distance ,",
    "the absolute visual magnitude of the central star is @xmath33 .",
    "thus it has roughly the luminosity of a normal red giant ( in agreement with most of the classical  stars , e.g. , mennessier et al .",
    "1997 ) . at this distance ,",
    "the major axis of the pn is @xmath34 pc , and the radius of the central star is @xmath35 . on the assumption of a nominal @xmath36 expansion velocity ,",
    "the age of the pn is 12,000 @xmath12 6,000  yr . if 4.7 days is the rotation period of the  star , then with a radius of @xmath37 and an inclination @xmath38 ( the apparent inclination of the pn ) , it would have a projected rotational velocity @xmath39 .",
    "since this is less than the @xmath8@xmath40 resolution of our spectra , we would not expect to see an obvious spectroscopic signature , even though this would be about 2/3 of the rotational breakup velocity .",
    "webo  1 has several properties in common with the class of `` abell  35''-type planetary nuclei .",
    "this class was defined by bond , ciardullo , & meakes ( 1993 ) , and has been discussed by bond ( 1994 ) , jasniewicz et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , jeffries & stevens ( 1996 ) , and gatti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in the three known a  35-type nuclei ( a  35 , lotr  1 , and lotr  5 ) , a rapidly rotating late - type giant or subgiant is seen optically , while a hot companion is detected at uv wavelengths .",
    "the cool components vary photometrically with periods of a few days , corresponding to their rotation periods .",
    "a definitive orbital period has not been found for any of these three objects from radial - velocity studies , suggesting that the orbital periods may be long .",
    "this suspicion is confirmed in the case of the field star hd 128220 , which lacks a pn but is otherwise similar in all respects to the a  35-type nuclei : its orbital period is 872  days ( howarth & heber 1990 ) .",
    "these systems , then , have almost certainly not undergone common - envelope interactions , which would have decreased their orbital periods by substantial amounts .",
    "as discussed by jeffries & stevens ( 1996 ) , there is a closely related class of wide binaries containing hot white dwarfs and cool , rapidly rotating , magnetically active _",
    "dwarfs_. these authors propose a mechanism in which an agb star in a wide binary develops a dense stellar wind , part of which is accreted by the companion star .",
    "their calculations suggest that significant spin - up of the companion may occur , along with accretion of chemically enriched material from the agb star .",
    "although jeffries & stevens considered their suggestion somewhat speculative ( in the absence of actual 3-d hydrodynamical simulations of the accretion and spin - up ) , observational support has arisen in the past several years .",
    "this includes the finding of mild ba enhancements in the rapidly rotating dk component of 2re  j0357 + 283 ( jeffries & smalley 1996 ) , and in the nuclei of a  35 and lotr  5 ( thevenin & jasniewicz 1997 ) .",
    "webo  1 , with its pronounced ba and c overabundances , now provides further support .",
    "a scenario that emerges to explain the properties of webo  1 is thus as follows .",
    "the progenitor system was a fairly wide binary whose components had nearly equal masses ( initial mass ratio @xmath80.98 ) .",
    "the more massive star evolved to the agb stage , at which point the less massive component had also begun to ascend the red - giant branch .",
    "the agb star was constrained to rotate with the orbital period , so that , as it developed a dense wind , the wind was ejected preferentially in the orbital plane , leading to the ring - like nebular morphology .",
    "the wind was enriched in ba and other _",
    "s_-process  elements , and had @xmath41 .",
    "a portion of the wind was accreted by the companion giant , spinning it up to the observed 4.7-day rotation period , and contaminating its photosphere with ba , c , and other pollutants . at present",
    ", the agb star has completely shed its envelope , exposing its hot core whose uv radiation ionizes the ejected ring .",
    "several follow - up studies are clearly warranted .",
    "( 1 )  ultraviolet spectra would confirm the expected presence of a hot companion ; a determination of its surface gravity from its ly@xmath2 profile would provide a mass determination , and thus an estimate of the progenitor s initial mass and constraints on evolutionary scenarios .",
    "( 2 )  radial velocities from ground - based spectra would allow a search for the orbital period , or set a lower limit if , as we suspect , the orbital period is long .",
    "( 3 )  high - dispersion spectra of the barium star should be obtained , to determine its rotational velocity and atmospheric elemental abundances .",
    "in particular , it would be of great interest to search for lines of technetium , which should be present if the star is really a very recently created barium star .",
    "( 4 )  an abundance analysis of the nebula would also be of interest , since it may be possible to detect lines of heavy _",
    "s_-process  elements .",
