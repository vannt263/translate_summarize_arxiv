    "the turbulence play an important role in the formation of the ocean structure @xcite .",
    "for example , the role of turbulence on the evolution of the spatial structure of a thin phytoplankton layer was examined in @xcite .",
    "semi  empirical models of turbulence are now widely used in methods of calculation turbulent flows .",
    "however practically there are few analytical approaches to research of this models .",
    "one of the examples of a three  dimensional free turbulent flow is a turbulent wake behind a body of revolution in a stratified medium . sufficiently complete",
    "experimental data on the dynamics of a turbulent wake behind a body of revolution in a linearly stratified medium were obtained by lin and pao and presented in @xcite .    the turbulent wake behind an axisymmetrical body in a linearly stratified medium was numerically simulated in @xcite . based on hierarchy of semi  empirical turbulence models of second order ,",
    "the numerical simulation of the dynamics of a turbulent wake in a stable stratified medium was carried out by chernykh et al .",
    "a satisfactory agreement with experimental data @xcite was obtained in @xcite .",
    "a series of papers @xcite was devoted to construction of similarity solutions of semi  empirical turbulence models .",
    "the present paper is a continuation of our investigations . in this paper",
    "we consider three  dimensional semi  empirical model of the far turbulent wake behind an axisymmetric self  propelled body in a passive stratified medium @xcite .",
    "considering problem is equivalent to the problem of the development of a turbulent mixing zone in a passive stratified medium @xcite .    in section 3",
    "we have to define the admissible differential operators of the point groups of transformations @xcite for considering model , which will allow us to pass to the system of the degenerate elliptic equations . in section 4",
    "we focus on the solutions of the second order to the b  determining equation @xcite for degenerate elliptic equations .",
    "this gives the corresponding differential constraints and allow us to pass to the system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "in section 4 we will present the calculation results .",
    "to calculate the characteristics of the far turbulent wake behind an axisymmetric self  propelled body in a passive stratified medium we use the three  dimensional semi  empirical turbulence model @xcite @xmath0 in this equations @xmath1 is the velocity of an incoming undisturbed flow , @xmath2 is the turbulent kinetic energy , @xmath3 is the kinetic energy dissipation rate , @xmath4 is the averaged density defect , and @xmath5 is the density fluctuation variance .",
    "the quantities @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are generally accepted empirical constants @xcite .    in what follows , we assume that the velocity of an incoming undisturbed flow equals unity .",
    "the marching variable @xmath12 in equations ( [ model1])([model4 ] ) acts as the time .    by analogy with @xcite , for the model",
    " we have to define the admissible differential operators of the point groups of transformations .",
    "group analysis of the system  performed by a standard scheme @xcite .",
    "the infinitesimal symmetry group of the model ( [ model1])([model4 ] ) is spanned by eight vector fields @xmath13    next consider the linear combination of the scaling vector fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 the solution of the model  invariant with respect to operator @xmath17 has the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the similarity variables . substituting presentation into  , we obtain the reduced system @xmath21    numerical analysis @xcite of degeneration of the far turbulent wake in a passive stratified medium show that the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 must be presented in the form @xmath24 note that the presentations are satisfied all the reduced equations . changing to polar coordinates @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and by virtue of the reduced system become @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 . here and elsewhere , subscripts denote derivatives , so @xmath32 , etc .",
    "we now apply the bde method @xcite to reduce the equations , to some ordinary differential equations .",
    "consider more general equation than @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are arbitrary functions .",
    "we take the b  determining equation corresponding to of the form @xmath37 here and throughout @xmath38 are the operators of total differentiation with respect to @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 are to be determined together with the function @xmath43 .",
    "note that for classical determining equations @xcite holds @xmath44 we seek second order solution of of the form @xmath45 substituting into bde leads to an equation which includes derivatives of the fourth order .",
    "we can express the derivatives @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 by means of . setting the coefficient of @xmath51 equal to",
    "zero we obtain @xmath52 .",
    "the left - hand side of is a polynomial with respect to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this polynomial must identically vanish .",
    "collecting similar terms we obtain the equations @xmath55 it is easy to show that the general solution of the equations is @xmath56    substituting the functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 into bde we obtain that the left - hand side of is a polynomial with respect to @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this polynomial must identically vanish .",
    "collecting similar terms leads to the following equations @xmath62 the equations imply @xmath63 here @xmath64 is arbitrary constant .",
    "clearly , that the riccati equation has the partial solution @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "thus we find the second order solution of the bde @xmath67 the corresponding differential constraint @xmath68 has the general solution @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are arbitrary functions .",
    "substitution into equation gives @xmath72    by analogy with the case of the equation , consider more general equation than @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are arbitrary functions .",
    "the bde method applied to equation gives rise to the following results : @xmath79    the formula for the equation takes the form @xmath80 clearly , that we must explain the case @xmath81 integrating differential constraint @xmath68 corresponding to the bde solution , we find @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are arbitrary functions .",
    "thus in the similarity variables @xmath85 and @xmath86 from , , we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "system  has to satisfy the conditions @xmath92    conditions takes into account flow symmetry with respect to the ox axis .",
