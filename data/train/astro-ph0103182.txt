    "is emitted by the optically thick accretion disk , while the hot inner region is responsible for generation of the hard spectral component .",
    "it was proposed that low and high frequency noise components in the power density spectrum are associated with outer optically thick and inner optically thin parts of the accretion flow respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is often assumed that qpo phenomenon is caused by the interaction between these two distinct parts of the accretion flow occurring on the local dynamical time scale at the boundary between these regions related to the local keplerian time ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . supporting this model ,",
    "the evidence of the correlation between an observed qpo frequency and the position of the boundary between optically thick and optically thin parts of the accretion flow was reported for the _ flaring _ states of grs 1915 + 105 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it looks natural to suggest that band limited white noise dominating the pds of grs 1915 + 105 may also be a product of the dynamic processes in the inner part of the accretion flow .",
    "then the dynamic time scales on both inner and outer boundaries of this region will determine an extent of the resulting noise spectrum in the frequency domain .",
    "given the position of high frequency cut - off in the pds and radial dependence of the dynamic oscillation frequency , one can estimate an approximate position of the inner boundary of the optically thin region .",
    "let us discuss individual properties of the two branches of the _ hard steady _ state on the basis of the above assumptions .",
    "we assume that characteristic frequencies of the qpo and bln noise components of the power density spectra of the grs 1915 + 105 are proportional to the keplerian frequency at the outer and inner boundaries of the optically thin region of accretion flow , i.e. @xmath40 , where @xmath41 hz , @xmath42  mass of the compact object in solar masses , @xmath43  distance to the compact object in units of 3 gravitational radii .",
    "_ type i state : _ if the hard spectral component originates through the comptonization of the low energy photons in the optically thin inner region , the observed cut - off energy of the spectrum indicates high electron temperature in this part of the accretion flow , @xmath44 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "typical value of the qpo centroid frequency allows one to estimate an approximate position of the outer boundary of the optically thin part of the accretion flow : @xmath45 .",
    "broad high - frequency component detected in all _ type i _ state observations is of particular interest .",
    "the position of the characteristic break of this component @xmath46 hz ( table [ pds_param ] ) is remarkably close to the position of the reccurent stable qpo at 67 hz observed mainly during the _ soft steady _ state ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this fact provides a possibility that the broad noise component can be related to this steady qpo and be interpreted as the effective broadening of the coherent oscillation feature .",
    "most of the models explaining the stable 67 hz qpo invoke some kind of oscillations near the inner edge of the accretion disk in the immediate vicinity of the compact object ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these oscillations may explain the high - frequency noise component detected during the _ type i _ state observations .",
    "_ type ii state : _ the properties of the x - ray and radio emission of grs 1915 + 105 in _ type ii _ state imply significantly different geometry and characteristics of the accretion flow compared to that of _ type i _ state .",
    "we suggest two possible interpretations of the observed shape of the hard spectral component in the _ type ii _ state .",
    "thermal comptonization mechanism implies relatively low electron temperature in the inner region , @xmath47 kev . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed break in the hard component can be explained as due to the transmission of the hard x - rays through dense surrounding matter with average thomson optical depth of the order of several ( assuming power law shape of the spectrum of illuminating radiation ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "typical value of the qpo centroid frequency during the _ type ii _",
    "states is close to that of the _ type i _ states , indicating possible similarity in the position of the outer boundary of the optically thin part of the accretion flow . as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ pds_lls ] , the pds of the _ type ii _ state demonstrates the lack of significant variability of the source at frequencies above @xmath4 hz .",
    "this fact may hint at the larger inner radius of the hot comptonization region with respect to the _ type i _ state . assuming noise generation mechanism described above , and given the characteristic cut - off frequencies of the pds in the _ type i _",
    "( @xmath48 hz ) and _ type ii _ ( @xmath49 hz ) state ( table [ pds_param ] ) , the ratio of the inner radii of the accretion flow , @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be estimated as @xmath52 . to explain higher value of the inner radius in the _ type ii _ state , the effective mechanism of the truncation of the accretion flow near the compact object in this state",
    "is needed .",
    "the observations at the radio and infrared wavelengths indicate the presence of a strong outflow of matter near the compact object coupled with a hot inner region ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is usually assumed that such outflows originate very close to the compact object , modifying the structure of the innermost part of the accretion flow .",
    "finally , we may suppose that contrary to the _ type i _ state in the _ type ii _ state the accretion flow extends down to some transition radius , followed by outflow region in the immediate vicinity of the compact object .    as a result , the difference between the properties of x - ray and radio emission of grs 1915 + 105 during _ type i _ and _ type ii _ _ hard steady _ states",
    "may be explained in terms of the different structure of the inner part of the accretion flow .",
    "contrary to the _ type i _ x - ray state , in the _ type ii _ state an inner region of the accretion flow coupled with a strong outflow of matter near the compact object , which causes the aforementioned differences in the observational properties .",
