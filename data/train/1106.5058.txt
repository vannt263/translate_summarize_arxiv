    "as some of the longest - surviving stellar populations in galaxies , globular clusters ( gcs ) provide a unique historical record of the major star formation events and baryonic mass assembly processes in galaxies .",
    "for example , observations of ongoing galaxy mergers @xcite have discovered populations of bright , blue , massive clusters ; follow - up studies indicate that these are likely proto - gcs forming in merger and/or starburst events @xcite .",
    "most galaxies contain two subpopulations of gcs as traced by their photometric colors ; bluer gcs are metal - poor and redder gcs are metal - rich for stellar populations older than @xmath7 gyr @xcite .",
    "studies of the two milky way gc populations  the metal - poor halo gcs and metal - rich thick disk / bulge gcs  have provided key insights into the formation of the galaxy @xcite , allowing for the comparison of model predictions to the observational properties of the galactic gc system ( see ashman & zepf 1998 and references therein ) . as compact , luminous ( average @xmath8 ; ashman & zepf 1998 ) objects ,",
    "gcs can be easily detected in galaxies at distances of several tens of mpcs .",
    "because photometric and spectroscopic techniques yield estimates of gc ages , metallicities , and kinematics @xcite , studies of extragalactic gc populations can deepen and refine our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the gc systems of giant galaxies are typically more spatially extended than the host galaxy light , often extending to many galaxy effective radii @xcite .",
    "as such , imaging studies using detectors with small spatial coverage can only directly measure _ local _ gc system properties .",
    "however , the _ global _ properties of gc systems can be accurately and directly measured from wide - field imaging data thereby minimizing extrapolations to global characteristics from data with less spatial coverage ( see rhode , windschitl , & young 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "the determination of the global properties of extragalactic gc systems  including total numbers of gcs , specific frequencies , spatial distributions , color distributions , and color gradients  has been the focus of our ongoing wide - field imaging study of galaxies across a range of environments and morphologies .",
    "these properties provide important constraints to galaxy formation models ; such models must reproduce the observed ensemble properties of gc systems .",
    "the survey methods and previous results are presented in rhode & zepf ( 2001 , 2003 , 2004 ; hereafter rz01 , rz03 , rz04 ) and rhode et al .",

    "this paper presents a study of the gc system of ngc 7457 , a lenticular ( s0 ) galaxy included in our survey sample ( see table  [ props ] for basic properties ) . since ngc 7457 is a field galaxy ( @xmath9 ; tully 1988 ) , this allowed us to examine the gc system properties of an s0 in an environment different from most lenticulars .",
    "this environmental difference is of primary importance when considering various s0 galaxy formation scenarios @xcite .",
    "although lenticulars make up a significant fraction of the galaxy population in nearby galaxy clusters @xcite and are important for understanding galaxy formation and evolution , the number of uniform and systematic studies of s0 gc systems _ as a class _ is quite small .",
    "@xcite used archival _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 data to examine the gc systems of 29 lenticulars , providing a sample for comparison to their _",
    "archival data study of the gc systems of ellipticals @xcite .",
    "these studies found similar mean @xmath10 colors ( @xmath11 ) for the gc populations in the two galaxy classes . because the _ hst _ imaging was relatively shallow , @xcite only detected color bimodality in one s0 and used statistical tests to estimate that @xmath12 of s0s are likely bimodal .",
    "the acs virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs ; peng et al .",
    "2006 ) imaged the central @xmath13 ( 17 kpc @xmath14 17 kpc ) of 32 virgo cluster s0s .",
    "the deeper imaging of this survey discovered color bimodality in @xmath15 of lenticulars .",
    "the acsvcs also confirmed the mean gc color - galaxy luminosity relation in early - type galaxies @xcite ; the lenticulars and ellipticals form an overlapping sequence of redder mean gc colors for increasing galaxy luminosity . while these results hint at similarities between the gc systems of early - type galaxies , at present the global properties of the gc systems of s0 galaxies remain poorly understood relative to giant ellipticals .",
    "we obtained @xmath0 wide - field imaging of the s0 galaxy ngc 7457 using the wiyn 3.5 m telescope and minimosaic imager .",
    "our ground - based imaging was complemented by the inclusion of published and archival _ hst _ data ; the high spatial resolution data allowed us to study the gc population closer to the galaxy center .",
    "we also performed surface photometry of ngc 7457 in order to compare the spatial distributions of the gc system and the galaxy field star population .",
    "previous studies of the gc system of ngc 7457 were done by chapeleon et al .",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter c99 ) and chomiuk , strader , and brodie ( 2008 ; hereafter csb08 ) .",
    "c99 performed ground - based @xmath16 imaging of ngc 7457 with a similar areal coverage ( @xmath17 ) to our wiyn study .",
    "csb08 used archival _ hst_/wfpc2 images and keck spectroscopy to probe the ages and metallicities of gcs in ngc 7457 .",

    "the global properties of the gc system are described in @xmath22 .",
    "a summary of this work and conclusions are given in @xmath23 .",
    "images of ngc 7457 were obtained in broadband @xmath0 filters over three nights in october 2009 using the minimosaic camera on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the minimosaic instrument consists of two @xmath24 ccd detectors ; on wiyn , it has a plate scale of @xmath25 per pixel and a field of view of @xmath26 . for the imaging ,",
    "the object was not centered on the minimosaic frame but was offset to increase radial coverage around the galaxy .",
    "figure  [ finder ] shows the location of the wiyn pointing overlaid on a digitized sky survey image of the surrounding area .",
    "good - quality imaging data of ngc 7457 were obtained on nights 1 and 3 of the run ; total exposure times were @xmath27 in @xmath28 , @xmath29 in @xmath30 , and @xmath31 in @xmath32 .",
    "because the sky conditions were photometric on night two , images of @xcite standard fields and single images of ngc 7457 were obtained in all filters . from these data we derived a photometric calibration solution consisting of color coefficients and zero points .",
    "the standard errors on the zero points ranged from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "while night two was photometric , the seeing was worse than on nights one and three and hence these data were only used for photometric calibration .    the images from nights one and three were used to construct one combined , deep exposure per filter of ngc 7457 and its gc system .",
    "first the data were overscan and bias level corrected as well as flat fielded using standard tasks in the mscred package of iraf .",
    "next , single - format fits images were constructed from the multi - extension fits files using the routines ` msczero ` , ` msccmatch ` , and ` mscimage ` .",
    "all images in all filters were then aligned to a chosen reference pointing .",
    "next , for each image we measured and subtracted a constant sky background level . for each filter , the corresponding images were scaled to a common flux level using the flux measurements of 10 - 20 bright stars on each image .",
    "the scale factors were applied and images in the same filter were combined using the ` imcombine ` task with ` ccdclip ` pixel rejection .",
    "lastly , the measured sky background of the image scaling reference frames were added back to the stacked images in each filter .",
    "the resultant mean full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the image point - spread functions ( psfs ) for these final combined images are @xmath35 in @xmath30 , @xmath36 in @xmath28 , and @xmath36 in @xmath32 .",
    "in order to derive a total apparent magnitude for ngc 7457 and compare the surface brightness profile of the galaxy to its gc system , we performed surface photometry on the final , deep @xmath30 band image .",
    "first , a constant sky level was removed by measuring the modal value of the background in a @xmath37 region of the image away from the galaxy light .",
    "this value was in excellent agreement with the median sky value determined for the image stacking and scaling described in @xmath18 .",
    "both unresolved and extended sources in the ngc 7457 field were masked to prevent them from contaminating the galaxy photometry .",
    "surface photometry was performed using the ellipse routine @xcite in iraf .",
    "we allowed the routine to fit ellipses from @xmath38 to @xmath39 . at @xmath40 ,",
    "the ellipse solutions became unstable , indicating that at this radius we have reached the image background level and have insufficient signal - to - noise for reliable photometry .",
    "figure  [ sfc_phot_plot ] shows the results of the surface photometry ; the surface brightness , ellipticity , and position angle are plotted as a function of the semi - major axis of the ellipses .",
    "the data are given in table  [ sfc_phot_table ] .",
    "the surface brightness profile shows a smooth decline in log - log space with an abrupt change in the profile at @xmath41 ; we describe the profile in more detail below and compare the profile to the surface density of gc candidates in @xmath42 .",
    "the ellipticity of the isophotes change quite rapidly in the inner @xmath43 but remains fairly constant at an average value of @xmath44 from @xmath43 to @xmath45 .",
    "we find evidence of twisty isophotes from the variation in position angles of the ellipses , although the range of overall variation from @xmath46 to @xmath47 is quite small . from interpolation within the surface brightness profile",
    ", we find the semi - major axis where the surface brightness reaches @xmath48 is @xmath49 ( @xmath50 kpc for our assumed distance ; table  [ props ] ) , in excellent agreement with the @xmath28-band rc3 value of @xmath51 @xcite . from the interpolated ellipticity at this radius we find a minor - to - major axis ratio at @xmath52 of @xmath53 , in good agreement with the rc3 value of @xmath54 @xcite and the bright galaxy catalog ( bgc ) value of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "following the formulation of @xcite , we calculate an inclination of @xmath56 , in good agreement with bgc value of @xmath57 .",
    "the shape of the surface brightness profile for ngc 7457 was investigated by fitting the data with a srsic profile of the form    @xmath58    where @xmath59 indicates the surface brightness in units of @xmath30 band luminosity per square parsec and the traditional srsic index @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 .",
    "thus @xmath62 corresponds to a de vaucouleurs profile and @xmath63 corresponds to an exponential profile . in magnitudes per square arcsecond",
    ", this profile has the form    @xmath64    a fit to the entire surface brightness profile yields a srsic index of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) but with a large @xmath67 value .",
    "restricting the fit to the inner region of the profile shows that the surface brightness follows closely to a de vaucouleurs law with @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , depending on the radial extent considered as the inner region .",
    "this profile generally describes fits ranging from @xmath70 to @xmath43 and from @xmath70 to @xmath71 . in the outer regions of the galaxy ,",
    "the light profile is better described by an exponential decline ; we find a range of srsic indices from @xmath72 , again depending on the choice of where the outer profile begins .",
    "our exploration of the srsic fits over various ranges indicate the that surface brightness profile is a combination of a de vaucouleurs law in the inner regions with an exponential decline in the outermost regions .",
    "this is consistent with an expectation of a bulge and disk component for this s0 galaxy .",
    "fisher & drory ( 2008 ; 2010 ) used bulge / disk decomposition profile fitting to study the optical and infrared surface brightness profiles of ngc 7457 .",
    "they found bulge srsic indices of @xmath73 ( @xmath30 band ; fisher & drory 2008 ) and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ; fisher & drory 2010 ) .",
    "although these values are close to the @xmath76 boundary between pseudobulges ( @xmath77 ) and classical bulges ( @xmath78 ; fisher & drory 2008 , 2010 ) , this suggests the presence of a featureless , elliptically - shaped classical bulge rather than a flattened , disky - shaped pseudobulge .",
    "we discuss the implications of ngc 7457 having a possible classical bulge in @xmath23 .",
    "the total apparent magnitude of ngc 7457 was computed according to the following procedure .",
    "first , the integrated magnitude of the galaxy to the outermost elliptical annulus was computed by the ellipse routine as part of the surface photometry . to extrapolate to an infinite radius and",
    "obtain the total magnitude , we fit an exponential profile to the outer portion of the surface brightness profile .",
    "an integration of this profile from the outermost elliptical annulus to infinity gave an additional @xmath79 magnitudes in @xmath30 band .",
    "the derived total apparent magnitude is @xmath80 , in good agreement with the rc3 value of @xmath81 @xcite . assuming no internal galaxy extinction and a negligible k - correction , applying a galactic extinction correction of @xmath82 ( table  [ props ] ) gives a total , extinction - corrected magnitude of @xmath83 .",
    "the derived value is between the recent measurement by @xcite of @xmath84 and the rc3 value of @xmath85 . for the remainder of this study",
    ", we adopt an absolute magnitude of @xmath86 from the derived total apparent magnitude and assumed distance modulus of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the detection of the gc system of ngc 7457 was performed following the procedure developed from our previous wide - field survey studies ( rz01 ; rz03 ; rz04 ; r07 ; r10 ) .",
    "we begin by smoothing each final combined image with a circular median filter with diameter @xmath88 .",
    "the smoothed image is then subtracted from the original and the sky background level is added back to the frame . all remaining steps in the analysis were performed on the galaxy - subtracted images .",
    "all sources on the image were detected using the daofind routine in iraf with a @xmath89 detection threshold for the @xmath90 images and a @xmath91 threshold for the @xmath28 image .",
    "regions with high noise levels and/or saturated pixels , such as along the frame edges , near bright stars , and in the saturated center of the galaxy , were masked out .",
    "a total of 1050 objects were detected in all three filters .    at the distance of ngc 7457 and",
    "given the resolution of the images ( @xmath92 ) , we expect the gc population to appear as point sources in the frames .",
    "we used a graphical software routine to refine our list of detected objects by removing extended sources .",
    "point sources were isolated by plotting the fwhm of the objects versus instrumental magnitude , selecting objects around the well - defined sequence delineated by the points sources .",
    "the scatter in the point source sequence increases at fainter magnitudes ; in this regime we allowed for a larger range of selected objects . after requiring that objects appear as point sources in all three filters we are left with 540 objects .    for the point source detections we performed aperture photometry in order to obtain calibrated magnitudes .",
    "aperture corrections were calculated by measuring the mean difference between the total magnitude and the magnitude within an aperture of radius @xmath93 .",
    "the aperture corrections ranged from -0.196 to -0.294 with errors of 0.001 - 0.003 . because the photometric solution was derived from data taken on night two and the final @xmath0 science images were constructed using data from nights one and three ( see @xmath94 ) , bootstrap offsets to the instrumental magnitudes of night two were determined using the final , stacked science images and the single images of ngc 7457 taken on night two .",
    "these offsets range from -0.061 to -0.063 with errors of 0.003 to 0.007 .",
    "the final , calibrated total magnitudes for image point sources were calculated by applying the aperture corrections , atmospheric extinction correction , bootstrap offsets , and photometric calibration coefficients to instrumental magnitudes derived from a @xmath95 radius photometric aperture .",
    "lastly , galactic extinction corrections of @xmath96 , @xmath82 , and @xmath97 magnitudes were applied to the calibrated data ; the corrections were obtained from the reddening maps of @xcite .",
    "the effect of an uncertainty on the extinction corrections on the gc candidate selection is considered in @xmath98 .",
    "the final step in deriving a list of gc candidates is to choose objects with @xmath0 colors and magnitudes that are consistent with those of nearby , confirmed gcs at the distance of ngc 7457 .",
    "this method of selecting gc candidates has been used in our previous survey studies ( rz01 ; rz03 ; rz04 ; r07 ; r10 ) .",
    "here we outline the methodology that is described in detail in rz01 . assuming a range of gc absolute magnitudes from @xmath99 to @xmath100 based on the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) of the milky way and other well - studied nearby galaxies @xcite , we eliminate point sources that are brighter than the brightest gc we would expect at the distance of ngc 7457 .",
    "we select gc candidates with @xmath101 and @xmath102 colors consistent with those of the milky way gcs , but allow for a larger range of metallicities ( [ fe / h ] = -2.5 to 0.0 ) .",
    "because low luminosity galaxies have smaller total numbers of gcs , we carefully consider those objects which may just barely fail the selection criteria to make sure we have included all likely gc candidates .",
    "additional data by which we can judge the probability of a point source being considered a gc are the radial proximity to the galaxy center and the appearance of the object in archival @xmath103 images ( see @xmath104 ) .",
    "figure  [ color_color_plot ] shows the color selection process for the point sources that passed the extended source cut ( see @xmath105 ) .",
    "also shown are the colors expected for galaxies of various morphological types from redshifts @xmath106 ( rz01 ) , illustrating where contaminating background galaxies are likely to lie in the color - color plane .",
    "we accepted any sources with @xmath107 and @xmath101 and @xmath102 colors ( including associated photometric errors ) within @xmath108 of the galactic gc @xmath102 versus @xmath101 relation .",
    "we evaluated each object that passed the magnitude and color selection step to make sure it should remain in the final sample .",
    "two objects that were barely outside the color selection but are close to the galaxy center were added back to the gc candidate sample .",
    "three objects which appeared in _ hst _ images to be background galaxies ( see @xmath104 ) were removed from the gc candidate list .",
    "the final sample consists of 136 gc candidates in the wiyn images of ngc 7457 ; the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the gc candidates is shown in figure  [ cmd_plot ] . because the galactic extinction correction is applied systematically to every object",
    ", the impact of an uncertainty in the extinction on the gc candidate selection corresponds to a systematic shift of all the point sources in the color - color plane along the reddening vector shown in figure  [ color_color_plot ] .",
    "the gc selection box ( as defined by the milky way gc system ) remains unchanged .",
    "we find that significant systematic increases or decreases in the @xcite @xmath109 reddening estimate ( such as doubling or halving the reddening ) make a negligible impact on our selection of gc candidates . at most only 1 - 2 objects",
    "would be added or removed from our gc candidate list based on these changes .",
    "to quantify the point - source detection limits we performed a series of completeness tests using the @xmath0 images employed to detect the gc system . for each test",
    ", 200 artificial stars were added to the image ; the magnitude of the artificial stars were chosen around 0.2 of a specified value and the adopted psf was taken as the best - fit average psf of the image .",
    "the identical steps used to detect the point sources in the original images were then performed , recording the fraction of recovered artificial stars .",
    "we repeated this process in 0.2 mag intervals over a range of 4 - 5 magnitudes per filter . taking the fraction of recovered stars in each magnitude interval then gave a measure of completeness as a function of magnitude which we show in figure  [ completeness ] .",
    "the wiyn images of ngc 7457 have 50% completeness limits of @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .      in ground - based imaging studies of extragalactic gc populations ,",
    "sample contamination from foreground galactic stars and background galaxies is a serious concern . following the steps from our previous imaging studies , in @xmath112 and @xmath104 we performed a series of analyses to help quantify the degree of contamination from these two sources .",
    "we ultimately adopted the contamination estimate from the asymptotic behavior of the gc radial profile as discussed in @xmath113 .      to estimate the degree of contamination from galactic foreground stars",
    ", we used a galactic structure model @xcite to predict the surface density of stars within a given magnitude range and color .",
    "we adopted the same galaxy structure parameters used in our previous studies ( position of the sun ; fraction of stars in the disk , thick disk , and halo ) .",
    "given the @xmath30 magnitude and @xmath101 color ranges from the gc candidate sample , the model predicted a surface density of stars of @xmath114 .",
    "ngc 7457 does not have an appreciably high galactic latitude ( @xmath115 , ned ) ; hence this modest degree of contamination does appear to be consistent with the large number of point sources covering a wide range of colors in figure  [ color_color_plot ] . because the galactic structure models do not constrain the range of @xmath102 colors , the model prediction is an upper limit to the degree of galactic foreground star contamination .",
    "an estimate of the contamination in the gc sample due to unresolved background galaxies was obtained by examining the gc candidates in archival _ hst _ images . since",
    "many background galaxies will be unresolved in our ground - based images , _ hst _ imaging of point sources in our field can show if any gc candidates are actually background galaxies .    for ngc 7457 , we downloaded _",
    "wfpc2 data from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) .",
    "the retrieved images were six pipeline - reduced , multi - extension fits files ( total exposure time 1380 s ) of a central pointing of ngc 7457 in the f555 filter ( program go.5512 ; pi faber ) .",
    "these images were also used by csb08 in their analysis of the ngc 7457 gc system ( see @xmath116 ) .",
    "the images were stacked using the stsdas task ` combine ` .",
    "thirty - three of the wiyn gc candidates were found on the _ hst _ image .",
    "following @xcite , we performed aperture photometry of these objects in 0.5 and 3 pixel apertures .",
    "the ratio of counts in the larger aperture to the counts in the smaller aperture provides a measure of the central concentration of these objects .",
    "slightly extended background galaxies would show a higher count ratio than the compact gcs , thereby providing an estimate of the fraction of the wiyn gc candidates which might be background galaxies .",
    "three objects in the wiyn gc sample were faint and had high count ratios ( ratio @xmath117 ) , indicating that they are likely background galaxies .",
    "in addition , these objects did not pass the gc candidate selection criteria employed by csb08 ( @xmath10 color cut and estimated absolute sizes ) .",
    "as noted in @xmath118 , these objects were removed from the final sample of wiyn gc candidates .",
    "considering these three high count ratio objects as background galaxies and the areal coverage of the _ hst_/wfpc2 field , we found @xmath119 ( assuming poisson statistics ) as our estimate of the background galaxy surface density .",
    "given the small areal coverage of the _ hst _ images and the correspondingly small numbers of gc candidates considered , our final estimate of the surface density of contaminating objects was determined from the asymptotic behavior of the radial profile of the gc system .",
    "we discuss this method and the results in @xmath120 .",
    "typical wide - field extragalactic gc studies show a central peak in a plot of the azimuthally - averaged surface density of gc candidates as a function of projected radial distance from the host galaxy center . assuming the observations have covered a sufficient area around the galaxy , this profile will decrease to a constant level when the full radial extent of the gc system has been measured .",
    "thus the outer regions of this profile can yield a measure of the surface density of foreground stars @xmath121 background galaxies ( harris 1986 ; r10 ) .",
    "a measurement of this surface density can then be subtracted from the radial profile to correct for contamination .",
    "we constructed the initial radial profile of ngc  7457 s gc system by counting the number of wiyn gc candidates in concentric circular annuli and computing the effective area in each annulus .",
    "we explored the shape of the radial profile in detail , examining the effects of using wider radial bins and different locations for the bin centers .",
    "ultimately we adopted radial bins from @xmath122 from the galaxy center ( inner edge of innermost annulus ) to @xmath123 ( outer edge of outermost annulus ) with a width of @xmath124 .",
    "inward of @xmath122 from the galaxy center we have no gc candidates and very little observed area due to the masking of the image .",
    "the effective area of each annulus is computed by taking the total area of the annulus and subtracting the area of any masked regions in that annulus .",
    "the profile shows a decreasing surface density which falls to a nearly constant level of @xmath125 in the outer three radial bins ( @xmath126 ) , indicating that we have observed the full outer radial extent of the gc system .",
    "the constant level in the three outer bins of the uncorrected radial profile is a good estimate of the surface density of contaminants in the gc candidate sample .",
    "the surface density of foreground stars from the galactic model was @xmath127 ; this is smaller than the asymptotic contaminant level but makes sense if one assumes that background galaxies will also contribute . the background galaxy contamination level as estimated from the _ hst _",
    "data was @xmath128 , which is higher than the level from the asymptotic behavior of the profile .",
    "it is quite possible that the former is an overestimate and it also has a large uncertainty .",
    "thus we adopted the observed asymptotic correction as the final estimate of the surface density of contaminants .",
    "we computed the contamination fraction for each annulus of the radial profile by multiplying the surface density of contaminating objects by the effective area of the annulus and then dividing this number by the number of gc candidates in that bin .      in order to determine the fractional coverage of the gclf",
    ", we assigned our wiyn gc candidates to @xmath30 magnitude bins with a width of @xmath129 magnitudes .",
    "we corrected the observed gclf for both contamination and magnitude incompleteness following the method outlined in rz01 .",
    "we accounted for contamination by considering the radial location of each gc candidate , applying the radially dependent contamination fraction determined in @xmath113 as a correction factor .",
    "magnitude incompleteness was determined from the results of the artificial star tests ( see @xmath130 and figure  [ completeness ] ) and the range of @xmath101 and @xmath102 colors of the gc candidates .",
    "the completeness corrections we applied ( the total completeness ) accounted for the individual incompleteness in all three filters as described in rz01 .",
    "these calculated total completeness corrections were then divided by the number of gc candidates in each magnitude bin to obtain a corrected gclf .",
    "figure  [ gclf_plots ] shows the observed gclf ( contamination corrected ; shaded histogram ) and the completeness - corrected histogram ( solid line histogram ) .",
    "the corrected gclf was then fit with a gaussian function to determine the observed coverage of this theoretical gclf .",
    "we assumed a peak absolute magnitude of @xmath131 based on observations of the milky way gc system @xcite . at the assumed distance of ngc 7457 ( table  [ props ] )",
    ", the apparent @xmath30 magnitude peak of the gclf corresponds to @xmath132 .",
    "we eliminated from the fitting the faintest three magnitude bins which had @xmath133 completeness values .",
    "we varied the dispersion of the gaussian fits between @xmath134 and @xmath135 and found the mean fractional coverage of the theoretical gclf by the observed gclf was @xmath136 .",
    "the gaussian fits are shown in figure  [ gclf_plots ] .",
    "varying the magnitude bin sizes between @xmath137 and @xmath138 mag yielded a change in the fractional coverage of @xmath139 to @xmath140 .",
    "we account for this variation in our error estimates on the total number of gcs in @xmath141 .",
    "csb08 used _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 archival images of ngc 7457 in the f555w and f814w filters to select a sample of gc candidates .",
    "these observations ( proposal go.5512 ; pi faber ) were taken during a single pointing , with the pc chip centered on the galaxy center ( see figure  [ finder ] ) .",

    "we compared the wiyn and _ hst _ gc candidate lists and found 29 of the 77 objects are common to both samples .",
    "of the 48 _ hst _ gc candidates which were not detected as gc candidates by our wiyn study , 37 were not detected during the ` daofind ` step ( see @xmath144 ) due to their spatial proximity to saturation bleed trails and/or their location near the galaxy center .",
    "only six of these 37 objects were missed to due their magnitude being fainter than the detection threshold in the images . of the remaining 11 of 48 objects that appeared in the hst list but not the wiyn list ,",
    "seven were rejected because they appeared extended in one or more of the wiyn images ( see @xmath144 ) .",
    "only two of these seven rejected objects were `` borderline '' cases .",
    "relaxing our extended source cut criteria would also increase contamination , so we decided not revise our extended source cut based on these results .",

    "these objects had @xmath101 and @xmath102 colors in the wiyn data that were significantly outside our color - color selection criteria ; no reasonable modification to our color cut would have included these objects in our wiyn sample .",
    "an additional check on our gc selection criteria comes from considering the thirteen spectroscopically - confirmed gcs .",
    "of these thirteen objects , eight were detected in our wiyn data ; the remaining five objects fell in masked regions of our image .",
    "for these eight detections , we note that none of the spectroscopically - confirmed gcs were rejected during our gc selection process .",
    "we constructed the radial surface density profile for the _ hst _ gc candidates in the following manner .",
    "we accounted for magnitude incompleteness by only considering the brightest _ hst _ gc candidates , imposing a magnitude cut at the gclf turnover magnitude of @xmath146 .",
    "since contamination from background galaxies with magnitudes @xmath147 should be relatively small @xcite , we assumed no contamination .",
    "to maintain a uniform comparison with the wiyn gc candidates , we imposed our color cut criteria on the _ hst _ gc candidate list .",
    "we removed four objects in the _ hst _ gc sample which had @xmath101 and @xmath102 colors _ as measured in the wiyn data _ which were inconsistent with our color selection . after applying these restrictions , 46 _ hst _ gc candidates",
    "were used to construct the gclf and radial profile .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "gclf was fit according to the same procedure as the wiyn data ; the mean fractional coverage is @xmath148 .",
    "varying the bin sizes changed the fractional coverage by @xmath149 and we include this uncertainty in the final error analysis .",
    "we constructed the final radial distribution of ngc  7457 s gc system by binning the wiyn and hst gc candidates into concentric circular annuli spaced @xmath124 apart .",
    "the superior resolution of _ hst _ yielded gc candidates closer to the galaxy center , so the _ hst _ annuli begin at a projected radius @xmath150 of @xmath151 whereas the first wiyn annulus starts at @xmath152 .",
    "the radial profile was corrected for missing area , contamination ( as appropriate ) , and magnitude incompleteness in the following manner .",
    "the missing area was considered by finding the effective area for each annulus ; the area covered by the masked regions in each annulus was computed and accounted for in the surface density calculation .",
    "contamination corrections were applied to the wiyn data using the radially - dependent contamination fractions ( see @xmath153 ) ; for the _ hst _ data we assumed no contamination ( see @xmath116 ) .",
    "lastly we corrected for magnitude incompleteness by dividing each bin by the fractional coverage of the observed wiyn or _",
    "gclf , respectively .",
    "the surface density was computed using the effective area and corrected total numbers for each radial bin ; uncertainties in the surface density are from poisson errors in the number of gcs and number of contaminating objects .",
    "figure  [ radial_profile ] shows the radial surface density as a function of projected average radius , where the average radius is the mean radius of the unmasked pixels in that annulus .",
    "table  [ radial_profile_table ] lists the corresponding data : average radius , surface density , errors , fractional areal coverage of each annulus ( area of unmasked pixels / total area ) , and data source ( either wiyn or _",
    "hst _ ) . because the gc system of ngc 7457 is found to have a large ellipticity ( see @xmath154 ) , we experimented with the use of concentric elliptical bins to construct the radial surface density profile .",
    "we found no significant dependence of the radial profile or profile fits ( see discussion below ) on the choice of bin shape .",
    "the radial profile of the ngc 7457 gc system follows the typical trend seen in our other wide field imaging studies ( rz01 ; rz03 ; rz04 ; r07 ; r10 ) : there is a sharp rise in the surface density approaching the galaxy center and smooth decrease with projected radius .",
    "although the wiyn data does measure the surface density of gcs quite close to the galaxy center ( @xmath155 ) , the addition of the _ hst _ data allows us to probe nearly three times further , to @xmath156 .",
    "however , the _",
    "hst_/wfpc field - of - view is insufficient to cover the full radial extent of the gc profile as evidenced by the wiyn data in the continued decline of the radial profile outside of @xmath157 .",
    "this underscores the importance of combining by wide - field imaging to observe the full radial extent of the surface density profile with high - resolution _ hst _ data which can measure the regions of the profile closer to the galaxy center ( r10 ) .",
    "we found that the surface density of gcs falls to zero within the errors in the radial bin centered at @xmath158 and remains consistent with zero outward of this radius .",
    "r07 present an empirical relation between the radial extent of the gc system and the galaxy mass for other galaxies observed for our wide - field gc system survey .",
    "the radial extent of the gc system was defined as the radius at which the surface density goes to zero within the errors and remains zero .",
    "this definition is therefore sensitive to the details of our analysis , including the magnitude completeness and the contamination correction to the radial profile .",
    "in addition , gcs are often found at very large radii ( @xmath159 kpc for the milky way ) , so there are very likely gcs in ngc 7457 beyond our measure of the radial extent .",
    "we compared our findings on the radial extent for ngc 7457 to the updated results presented in r10 . for our assumed distance ( table  [ props ] ) , we found a radial extent of @xmath160 kpc , where the uncertainty in the radial extent includes the uncertainty in the distance modulus and a one bin - width uncertainty in the determination of the radial extent from the surface density profile .",
    "for the galaxy mass , we used a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath161 for s0 galaxies from @xcite in combination with our derived @xmath162 ( table  [ props ] ) and find @xmath163 . refitting the radial extent - mass relation with a second - order polynomial using the result for ngc 7457 with the data in r10 yields coefficients consistent with those of r10 within the errors .",
    "the radial distribution of gcs was investigated further by fitting the corrected radial profile with various functional forms : a power law profile ( @xmath164 ) , de vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath165 ) , and srsic profile ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "the srsic profile fitting yielded highly uncertain results ; a wide range of possible parameters give very similar @xmath67 values .",
    "test data sets with comparable numbers of data points and scatter to our observed profile were constructed to better understand this behavior .",
    "we found that the small numbers of data points in inner regions of the radial profile and a strong sensitivity to the initial guesses for the fit parameters yield a model that is not well constrained by the data .",
    "the de vaucouleurs law and power law both provided good fits to the data , intersecting nearly all the points in the profile ; the reduced chi - squared value for the power law ( 0.70 ) was slightly smaller than that for the de  vaucouleurs law ( 0.92 ) .",
    "the fit parameters are given in table  [ profile_fits ] and figure  [ radial_profile ] shows the de vaucouleurs and power law fits to the data .",
    "we discuss the calculation of the total number of gcs from the integration of the radial profile in @xmath141 .",
    "figure [ profile_comp_plot ] compares the radial surface density of ngc  7457 s gc system to the radial distribution of the galaxy light . in the figure ,",
    "the surface brightness profile derived in @xmath167 has been converted to linear ( intensity ) units and scaled to the gc surface density at an arbitrary point , @xmath168 .",
    "the profiles have similar shapes in the inner @xmath169 , but the gc profile remains relatively flat at larger radii even as the galaxy light decreases exponentially .",
    "this is consistent with the general picture of gc systems as being more spatially extended than the parent galaxy light @xcite .",
    "we caution , however , that the errors in the gc surface density become large in the outer portions of the profile and hence the difference between the profiles  although suggestive  is not statistically significant .",
    "figure  [ spatial_distribution_plot ] shows the positions of the wiyn gc candidates on the wiyn frame .",
    "it is readily apparent that the gc candidates do not show a uniform azimuthal distribution about the galaxy center .",
    "instead the gc system appears to be preferentially aligned along the major axis of the galaxy in an elliptical distribution . in order to study the azimuthal distribution of the gc system of ngc 7457",
    ", we implemented the method of moments algorithm @xcite to estimate the ellipticity @xmath170 and position angle @xmath171 of the gc system .    for our analysis",
    "we followed the methodology outlined by @xcite and @xcite , using an iterative method to determine @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "first , the gcs within a circular aperture were used to derive an initial unbiased estimate of @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "this initial estimate is next used to define an elliptical aperture and gcs within this ellipse are used to recompute @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "for the elliptical aperture , we scaled the semi - major axis to the radius of the initial circular annuli to include as much of the gc population as possible in the calculation @xcite .",
    "the final ellipse parameters were determined after performing these calculations to some predefined tolerance .",
    "the method of moments also requires that the measurement annuli lie entirely on the frame . because of the position of ngc  7457 on one side of the images , this requirement means we are restricted to examining the ellipticity and position angle within the central @xmath172 of the galaxy ( projected radius of @xmath173 kpc ) .",
    "lastly , we hold the center of the gc distribution constant at the same @xmath174 position of the center of the galaxy light we used to derive the gc surface density profile .    for the inner @xmath172 of the gc system , we find an ellipticity @xmath175 and position angle @xmath176 ( measured east of north ) determined from 46 gc candidates .",
    "our uncertainties were estimated via monte carlo bootstrapping ; comparable but slightly larger uncertainties of @xmath177 in ellipticity and @xmath178 in position angle are found from the simulation - derived formulae of @xcite .",
    "in general we find good agreement between the ellipticity and position angle of the gc system and the galaxy isophotes , respectively .",
    "our derived value of @xmath179 for the gc system is slightly lower than the average galaxy position angle of @xmath180 , although it is consistent within the errors with the entire range of galaxy isophote position angles .",
    "similarly , we measure a larger ellipticity for the gc system ( @xmath181 ) than for the galaxy light ( @xmath182 from @xmath183 to @xmath184 ) , but this difference is only significant at the @xmath185 level , depending on the adopted error in the gc system ellipticity .",
    "because we have several masked ( unmeasurable ) regions on our images  particularly the central region of the galaxy where the galaxy - subtraction process is imperfect  we investigated whether these regions impart a bias into the determination of the ellipticity and position angle .",
    "we compared the results from two monte carlo experiments of simulated gc spatial distributions : one which ignored masked regions and one , like our observations , where the masks were present .",
    "for both the masked and unmasked cases we created 10,000 gc systems and used the method of moments algorithm to derive ellipticities and position angles .",
    "a single gc system was simulated by randomly placing gcs in elliptical bins which matched the ellipticity , position angle , and radial surface density profile derived for the ngc 7457 gc system ; gc positions were further restricted if the the masked regions were being considered .",
    "the total number of gcs in each simulated system was set to match the ngc 7457 observations . comparing the results from these two experiments",
    ", we found only a slight bias towards higher ellipticities of @xmath186 introduced by the masked regions .",
    "similarly for the position angle we find only a slight bias of @xmath187 towards a larger position angle . although these biases are systematic and not random uncertainties , they are well below our measurement error .",
    "lastly we examined the likelihood that one would measure the derived ellipticity and position angle of the ngc 7457 gc system by chance from a circular ( i.e. azimuthally random ) gc distribution .",
    "in general , an intrinsically circular spatial distribution analyzed via the method of moments will systematically return a non - zero ellipticity .",
    "this is especially problematic when using small numbers of objects @xcite .",
    "so , given the total number of objects matching our observed sample , we wished to know how often one would measure a large ellipticity because of small number effects _ even if the spatial distribution is intrinsically circular_. to investigate this , we examined the probability of obtaining our observed @xmath170 and @xmath171 from a random distribution that accounted for the masked regions .",
    "we simulated 10,000 gc spatial distributions with no ellipticity by placing gcs randomly in azimuth around the galaxy center , matching the ngc 7457 observations of the radial surface density profile and total number of gcs .",
    "examining the resulting distributions of @xmath170 and @xmath171 , we find the probability of obtaining simultaneously the measured ellipticity ( @xmath188 ) and position angle ( @xmath189 ) within @xmath190 of their measured values is only @xmath191 .",
    "hence we can reject the hypothesis that the observed ellipticity and position angle were observed by - chance from a azimuthally - random distribution at the @xmath192 confidence level .      in order to investigate the relative populations of blue ( lower - metallicity ) and red ( higher - metallicity ) gcs in ngc 7457",
    ", we first created a subsample from our total gc candidate list that has a magnitude completeness of @xmath193 in all three filters ( see rz01 for details and methodology ) .",
    "we found 65 out of the 136 wiyn gc candidates met this criteria and we refer to this group as the  90% sample \" .",
    "we can further minimize the fraction of contaminants in this sample by imposing a radial cut on the 90% sample at @xmath194 ( see @xmath195 ) , giving a total of 40 gc candidates .",
    "the @xmath196 color distribution for the 90% sample and the radially - constrained 90% sample are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ color_distribution ] .",
    "for comparison , the subset of the milky way gcs with @xmath196 integrated colors ( 82 gcs ; harris 1996 ) are shown in the top panel of figure  [ color_distribution ] .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test rejects the hypothesis that the milky way gc subset and the ngc  7457 90% sample have the same @xmath196 distribution at only the 89% significance level ; the k - s test does not show strong statistical evidence to reject a common population distribution .",
    "we examined the @xmath196 gc colors as a function of projected radius , both for the 90% and 90% radially - constrained samples , to test for a color gradient in the ngc 7457 gc system .",
    "linear fits to the data showed best - fit slopes consistent with zero within the errors .",
    "thus we find no evidence of a statistically significant color gradient , although the numbers of gcs in the 90% samples are small .",
    "we ran the gaussian mixture modelling ( gmm ) code from @xcite on our 90% sample .",
    "the gmm code uses several statistics to test whether the color distribution is better described by one or two gaussian functions .",
    "in addition to reproducing the results of the kmm algorithm from @xcite , the gmm code also uses the kurtosis of the distribution and the separation of the means ( relative to their widths ) as complementary tests of bimodality . like kmm",
    ", gmm allows one to test both the homoscedastic ( two gaussians with the same dispersion ) and heteroscedastic ( different dispersions ) cases . for our 90% sample of 65 objects ,",
    "the mixture modelling results show that the unimodal hypothesis could only be rejected at the 72% confidence level ( heteroscedastic case ) .",
    "that is , _ we do not detect color bimodality at a statistically significant level_. if we also consider the @xmath197value peak separation statistic as a complementary test of bimodality , the unimodal hypothesis could only be ruled out at the 28% confidence level and hence this statistic also strongly argues against bimodality .",
    "we should stress that mixture modelling with small numbers of objects inherently lowers the reliability of detecting bimodality @xcite .",
    "as the number of objects decreases , an increasingly large separation between the distribution means is required to strongly detect bimodality .",
    "our results are consistent with previous studies where bimodality was also not detected ( c99 , csb08 ) in ngc  7457 s gc system .",
    "both studies performed mixture modelling on their respective @xmath10 data and find the distribution consistent with a single gaussian peaking at @xmath198 ( csb08 ) and @xmath199 ( c99 ; their maximum likelihood estimate ) .",
    "c99 also examine the @xmath200 colors and find the data consistent with a unimodal distribution with a mean @xmath201 ( their maximum likelihood estimate ) . despite the lack of an observed bimodality",
    ", both blue and red gcs candidates are detected .",
    "c99 claimed that ngc  7457 lacks a population of metal - poor gcs similar to the halo gcs in the milky way @xcite .",

    "the wiyn sample still includes blue and red gc candidates consistent with those observed in the galaxy .",
    "c99 explain the observed broad distribution and lack of bimodality as arising from the presence of the usual old metal - rich and metal - poor populations , but with a difference in their mean metallicities ( e.g. peak separation ) that is smaller than could be detected .",
    "csb08 offer a different picture ; they explain the broad distribution by the presence of an intermediate - age population , which in combination with the typical metal - rich and metal - poor populations causes the large peak in the distribution at @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "spectroscopic data for a large sample of gcs in ngc  7457 would thus be invaluable in helping to discriminate between alternative explanations of the broad color distribution .",
    "we integrated the best - fit de vaucouleurs profile to obtain an estimate of the total number of gcs @xmath212 in ngc 7457 .",
    "although the power law provided a slightly better fit to the surface density data ( see table  [ profile_fits ] ) , it predicts a steeply - rising surface density at small radius ( and infinite surface density at @xmath213 ) so is not a physical useful model for the purposes of integration .",
    "integrating the de vaucouleurs law from @xmath214 ( the inside edge of the innermost radial bin ) to @xmath215 ( the outer edge of the bin where the gc surface density drops to zero within the errors ) yields 200 gcs .",

    "assuming instead that the radial distribution inside @xmath151 is flat ( with the same surface density as in the innermost bin ) yields 1.5 gcs . averaging these results",
    "yields a final value of @xmath216 gcs in ngc 7457 .",
    "the error in @xmath217 was calculated as described in our previous gc system studies ; it includes uncertainties in : ( 1 ) fractional coverage of the gclf , given choices in bin sizes and dispersion ; ( 2 ) the number of gcs and contaminating objects , assuming poisson statistics ; ( 3 ) the number of gcs in the central , unobserved regions of the galaxy .",

    "we assumed that the measured surface density in each radial bin was constant across that bin , and using the calculated area of each bin obtained a number of gcs in that bin .",

    "give an overview of such mechanisms , including tidal interactions , ram - pressure stripping , galaxy harassment , viscous stripping , thermal evaporation , and galaxy starvation / strangulation .",
    "however , because ngc 7457 is located in the field , we are particularly interested in s0 galaxy formation scenarios that do not rely on a cluster environment for gas removal or star - formation suppression .    the luminosity - normalized specific frequency of gcs @xmath225 has recently been proposed as a means of tracing `` galaxy fading '' in lenticulars @xcite .",
    "if s0 galaxies form from gas removal in spirals then , as star formation declines and the stellar populations age , the total @xmath30-band luminosity of the galaxy will decrease and the global color of the galaxy should become more red .",
    "if in addition the total number of gcs in the galaxy remains constant ( a key assumption which ignores gc destruction mechanisms ) , the decreasing @xmath30-band magnitude should lead to an increasing @xmath225 as the system ages .",
    "such a correlation between @xmath225 and galaxy color was found by @xcite using the global galaxy colors from the photometry of @xcite and @xcite with the `` local '' @xmath225 values from the _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 sample of lenticulars from @xcite . here",
    "the local specific frequency is defined as the specific frequency within the _ hst_/wfpc2 field - of - view , in contrast to a global value derived from observations like ours , where the full radial extent of the gc system and galaxy light have been observed .    to compare our results for ngc 7457 to this trend",
    ", we estimated a local specific frequency of @xmath257 by only considering the gc radial profile and integrated galaxy light in the central @xmath172 .",
    "from @xcite , the global galaxy colors for ngc 7457 are @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 .",
    "we find that ngc 7457 is not consistent with the observed color-@xmath225 trend of @xcite , particularly in the @xmath261 plane where the correlation has the least amount of scatter ( see their figure  2 ) .",
    "ngc 7457 appears to be either too blue for its @xmath225 or has a much larger @xmath225 for its observed color .",
    "although ngc  7457 shows better agreement in the @xmath262 and @xmath263 planes , the overall scatter in the trends are significant .",
    "while an inconsistency with the global color-@xmath225 trend may suggest that fading has been largely unimportant in the evolution of ngc 7457 , it should be noted that this relation was derived from a sample comprised almost entirely of cluster or group s0 galaxies .",
    "thus the galaxy color-@xmath225 trend likely includes an environmental bias and should be explored with a sample of lenticulars which cover a wider range of environments .    as an alternative model of s0 galaxy formation , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have shown that mergers of unequal - mass , gas - rich spirals ( mass ratio @xmath264 ) can produce remnants with the observed properties of s0s . in the @xcite simulations , vertical dynamical heating in the disk of the more massive galaxy",
    "creates the thickened disk component often observed in s0 galaxies .",
    "the tidal interations and subsequent merging of the galaxies remove the majority of the gas in two moderate bursts of star formation , resulting in a central concentration of new stars . similarly , major mergers have been proposed as a formation mechanism for new populations of gcs @xcite . the larger gc systems of ellipticals relative to spirals ( as traced by specific frequencies ) may be due at least in part to additional gcs formed during the mergers . therefore a merger ,",
    "if it were gas - rich and created gcs , might help explain the relatively large specific frequencies of ngc 7457 ( @xmath5 , @xmath265 ) for its mass . for comparison , we find average specific frequencies for ellipticals of @xmath266 , @xmath267 ( 6 galaxies ; r10 ) versus @xmath268 , @xmath269 for spirals ( 9 galaxies including m31 and the galaxy ; r10 ) . by total numbers of gcs , however , ngc 7457 is more consistent ( @xmath270 ) with the average value for spirals ( @xmath271 ; 9 galaxies , including m31 and the galaxy ) .",
    "determining the global properties of gc systems for a larger sample of s0s will be critical in refining the comparison across morphological types .",
    "additional evidence for a merger origin for ngc 7457 comes from the discovery of a counter - rotating galaxy core @xcite .",
    "such kinematically distinct cores are thought to be signatures of merger events ( see forbes et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) and can arise in simulations of unequal mass spiral - spiral mergers @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied ngc 7457 using integral field unit spectroscopy and derived a two dimensional line - of - sight velocity map of the galaxy s central region .",
    "these data also provided absorption line equivalent widths ; using lick indices @xcite , ages and metallicities of the stellar populations were explored .",
    "in addition to observing a counter - rotating core , @xcite found that the core was significantly younger ( age @xmath272 gyr ) and more metal - rich ( approximately solar ) than the surrounding bulge region ( age @xmath273 gyr ; approximately one - half solar metallicity ) .",
    "csb08 provided circumstantial evidence for a gc population with an age comparable to that of the core ( @xmath274 gyr ) , noting that this gc population could have been formed in the same star formation event that resulted in the young , chemically - distinct core .",
    "if such an intermediate age gc population is confirmed , this could be additional evidence for an increased number of gcs resulting from star formation in a merger event .",
    "the evidence from surface photometry of a classical bulge in ngc 7457 ( fisher & drory 2008 , 2010 ; see @xmath275 ) is also suggestive of a merger history in this galaxy .",
    "classical bulges are thought to arise as a result of merger events , while pseudobulge formation is associated with internal dynamic processes such as bars , ovals , and spiral structure @xcite .",
    "as noted by csb08 , the large number of metal - rich gcs in ngc 7457 would also be consistent with a merger - built bulge , assuming such mergers were sufficiently gas - rich and included gc formation .",
    "however , it is not clear why the central velocity dispersion of this galaxy ( @xmath276 ; silchenko et al .",
    "2002 , cherepashchuk et al .",
    "2010 ) is low like a pseudobulge if the bulge was formed from mergers ; merger events should give rise to a dynamically - hot bulge ( see fisher & drory 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , both the estimated total number of gcs in ngc  7457 and the gc @xmath196 color distribution are similar to the milky way , which has a pseudobulge @xcite and may only have a small merger - built classical bulge component @xcite .",
    "additional studies of the core and bulge regions in ngc 7457 will be necessary to further explore the role of merger or secular processes .",
    "further insights into formation scenarios could be gained from a large - sample spectroscopic study of gcs in ngc 7457 .",
    "although we have detected a very elliptical gc spatial distribution , without kinematic data it is difficult to interpret this observation .",
    "an inclined , disky population of gcs could possibly reproduce the observed elliptical distribution .",
    "the dynamics of gc systems in e / s0s formed in spiral - spiral mergers has been explored by @xcite ; kinematic data on gcs in ngc 7457 would give an additional means of investigating a possible merger history in this galaxy .",
    "thus future spectroscopic studies of gcs in ngc 7457 could provide key data for understanding the formation and evolution of this galaxy , both in determining gc ages and exploring the kinematics of the gc system .",
