    "these bursts have rise times ranging from a fraction of a second to a few tens of seconds , durations ranging from about ten seconds to several thousand seconds , recurrence times @xmath010@xmath110@xmath2  s , peak luminosities @xmath010@xmath3  ergs  s@xmath4 , and total energy releases @xmath010@xmath510@xmath6  ergs @xcite .",

    "the properties of the large number of bursts that have been observed using the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) have recently been summarized by @xcite .",
    "planck ( blackbody ) functions are often fit to the energy spectra of bursts @xcite . during some ,",
    "the temperature obtained from such fits drops and the derived emitting area increases . these photospheric radius expansion ( pre )",
    "bursts are thought to occur when the radiative flux through the stellar atmosphere exceeds the eddington critical flux , creating an optically thick wind ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the radiative flux is greater than the eddington flux for any realistic neutron star if the emission has a planck spectrum with a temperature measured at infinity @xmath7  kev ( see @xcite and section  [ sec : max - temp ] ) .",
    "yet fits of planck functions to burst spectra frequently yield temperatures substantially higher than this expected maximum , even during times when there is no evidence of radius expansion .",
    "neutron stars are not blackbodies , and conventional model atmosphere calculations show that they generally do not produce planck spectra ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". in conventional atmospheres , energy - dependent absorption and scattering cause the spectrum to peak at an energy higher than the peak of a planck spectrum with the same effective temperature .",
    "this effect led to widespread acceptance of the hypothesis that the effective temperature is substantially smaller than the temperature obtained by fitting a planck function to the burst spectrum and that the radiative flux is sub - eddington even when the fitted temperature exceeds 2.0  kev ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , section 2.2 ) .",
    "in contrast to conventional neutron star atmospheres , low - density atmospheres extensive enough to fully comptonize free - free and cyclotron photons will produce bose - einstein spectra @xmath8 $ ] with chemical potentials @xmath9 that satisfy @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these spectra have almost the same shape and energy flux as a planck spectrum with the same temperature , because a planck spectrum is a bose - einstein spectrum with @xmath11 .",
    "an important aspect of bose - einstein spectra is that knowledge of the radiation temperature and the chemical potential is sufficient to determine the radiative flux from the emitting surface ; knowledge of the distance to the source or its luminosity is unnecessary .",
    "here we report analyses of _ rxte _ data taken during high - temperature segments of a superburst from and a long burst from .",
    "such segments provide the best opportunity to test spectral models , because the large number of counts collected allows the spectrum to be measured with exceptionally high precision .",
    "we find that the spectra predicted by currently available conventional atmosphere models appear incompatible with the spectra during these segments , whereas bose - einstein spectra fit these spectra well .",
    "the fits give @xmath12 and values of @xmath13 substantially greater than 2.0  kev , implying radiative fluxes at the emitting surface more than a factor of three larger than the eddington flux .",
    "there is no evidence that the emitting surface is expanded at these times .",
    "we find that the spectra of other bursts from and and bursts from many other bursters are well - fit by similar bose - einstein spectra , suggesting that the radiative flux also exceeds the eddington flux during these bursts .",
    "the radiative flux from a neutron star atmosphere confined by gravitation can not exceed the eddington flux . as explained in section  [ sec : intro ] , the energy fluxes of bose - einstein spectra with modest chemical potentials are very similar to the fluxes of planck spectra with the same temperature , so we can use the planck form as a proxy . the maximum allowed surface temperature ( measured at infinity ) for emission with a planck spectrum from a star with mass @xmath14 and radius @xmath15 can be determined by balancing the inward gravitational and outward radiative accelerations at @xmath15 .",

    "we usually subtracted the average preburst emission during a 16  s interval preceding the burst .",
    "we also constructed burst spectra without subtracting any preburst emission , using ` pcabackest ` ( version 3.8 , also recently improved ) to estimate the purely instrumental background . in all cases we considered only the energy range 327.5  kev ( to concentrate on the thermal emission ) and used the data from all pcu layers .",

    "the pca spectrum at the burst peak shows an fe  k@xmath42 emission line at zero redshift  @xcite , indicating that it is produced outside the neutron star atmosphere .",
    "we analyzed four 64-s segments of data from different parts of this burst .",
    "the measured spectra of all of these segments are similar and are well fit by bose - einstein spectra , with best - fit temperatures ranging from 2.0  kev to 2.9  kev , but appear inconsistent with the spectra predicted by currently available conventional model atmospheres . here",

    ", @xmath44 is the simulated counts minus the bose - einstein counts , divided by the square root of the simulated counts .",
    "comparison of the simulated spectrum with the best - fitting bose - einstein spectral shape gives @xmath51 .",
    "results like these indicate that the emitted spectrum is close to a bose - einstein spectrum , that the effective temperature is @xmath52  kev , and that the radiative flux at the emitting surface exceeds the eddington flux . ]",
    "we first tested bose - einstein ( adjustable @xmath9 ) and planck ( @xmath11 ) models for the spectra produced by burst atmospheres , by fitting these models to the data .",
    "the bose - einstein spectrum is not yet in xspec and we therefore used our own fitting routines for it .",
    "our routines reproduce the xspec results for models that are in the library .",
    "we used the xspec routine ` bbody ` to fit a planck spectrum to the data .",
    "an external emission line was included with both spectral models .",
    "both provide an excellent description of the measured spectrum ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig-1820 ] ) .",
    "the implied radiative flux at the emitting surface during this segment is at least four times greater than the eddington flux for any realistic neutron star .",
    "we then investigated whether the spectra predicted by conventional model atmospheres with sub - eddington fluxes are consistent with the spectrum we measured .",
    "no analytic descriptions of these model spectra are available , so we used standard methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to construct the pca photon spectra they predict .",
    "we first redshifted the published theoretical spectra by an amount appropriate to the surface gravity of the model , using the apr equation of state @xcite .",
    "we then constructed pca count spectra using ` txt2xspec ` ( written by randall smith ) and ` fakeit ` .",
    "finally , we normalized the count spectra to make the total number of counts the same as in the spectrum measured by the pca .",
    "too few conventional atmosphere spectra have been published to be able to fit them to the high - precision pca spectra , so we compared them with the bose - einstein spectral shape , which we have shown provides an excellent description of the observed spectrum , adjusting the shape to match the model spectra as closely as possible .",
    "no external emission line was included , because all these models describe the spectrum produced by the burst atmosphere alone .",
    "the conventional atmosphere models we studied are the @xmath53  k , @xmath5414.8 h@xmath43he model of @xcite and the @xmath55  k , @xmath5614.1 , 14.3 , 14.5 , and 14.7 solar composition models of @xcite .",
    "these models span a substantial range of surface effective temperatures @xmath57 , surface gravities @xmath58 , and compositions .",
    "these models produce spectra that peak at an energy higher than a bose - einstein spectrum with the same effective temperature but all have shapes that deviate systematically , similarly , and strongly ( @xmath59 ; see , e.g. , figure  [ fig-1820 ] ) from the bose - einstein spectral shape that describes the measured spectra .",
    "the deviations of the solar composition models from the observed spectral shape are not caused by the lines in these spectra : the energy response of the pca is much broader than these lines and the fit is not improved significantly by excising them .    a long ( @xmath0500-s ) burst from was observed on 1999 october 6 using the pca .",
    "@xcite have reported that during a @xmath0100-s interval the spectrum of this burst is well - fit by planck spectra with @xmath60  kev and that there is no evidence of radius expansion during this interval .",
    "we have analyzed a 64-s segment of pca data starting 10  s after the beginning of this burst and confirm that planck and bose - einstein spectra fit this data well , whereas the available conventional atmosphere spectra are again incompatible with the measured shape of the spectrum ( @xmath61 for the conventional h@xmath43he model atmosphere of @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to analyzing four data segments from the superburst and a segment from the long burst , we also analyzed shorter segments of pca data on many other , shorter bursts , to determine whether their spectra are also well - fit by bose - einstein spectral models .",
    "these data were taken using the event mode , which provides 64 energy channels .",
    "using tables of the results obtained by @xcite , kindly provided by duncan galloway , we selected segments that are well - fit by a planck spectrum ( @xmath62 ) and have a best - fit temperature @xmath63 well above 2.0  kev ( @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the lower boundary of the 68.3% temperature confidence interval ; @xmath66 and @xmath65 are given by galloway et al . ) .",
    "we found 1834 such segments , from 34 sources , including and ; 4u  1728@xmath6734 is particularly prolific , with 556 such segments .",
    "we again fitted bose - einstein and planck spectra to the selected data segments .",
    "for these segments , we included photoelectric absorption using the xspec routine ` phabs ` .",
    "the results listed in table  [ tbl - fits ] are typical of our results for all these segments .",
    "the temperatures obtained by fitting bose - einstein and planck spectra to these intervals are consistent with each other and are formally @xmath6810@xmath69 higher than the 2.0  kev upper limit we established in section  2 , implying that the fluxes during all these segments are super - eddington .",
    "these segments were selected as particularly likely to have high temperatures , but they are representative of the general burst population .",
    "@xcite suggested that the high fitted temperatures may be artifacts produced by subtracting preburst emission .",
    "we therefore constructed spectra without subtracting any preburst emission , but found that the bose - einstein model also fit them and gave temperatures at least as high as before .",

    "the shapes of the spectra predicted by all the currently available conventional model atmospheres appear incompatible with the spectrum measured near the peaks of the superburst and the long burst from .",
    "we have also found that the spectra of shorter bursts from these two sources and many bursts from many other bursters are well - fit by bose - einstein spectra with high temperatures similar to the temperatures of the spectra that fit the superburst and the long burst , suggesting that the radiative flux also exceeds the eddington flux during these shorter bursts .",
    "high spectral temperatures appear to be the rule rather than the exception , particularly for pre bursts . according to the data tables of @xcite ,",
    "which present fits of planck spectra , 224 of 235 pre bursts have at least one 0.25-second segment when @xmath7  kev and @xmath80 ; 488 of the 665 non - pre bursts also have at least one such segment .",
    "if such high spectral temperatures do indicate super - eddington fluxes , these results show that this phenomenon is widespread .",
    "when the radiative flux falls below the eddington flux , the burst atmosphere may be supported by gas pressure gradients rather than the radiation force .",
    "if so , the atmosphere will become more dense , and the spectrum is likely to deviate from a bose - einstein spectrum .",
    "@xcite have reported that burst spectra are less likely to be described adequately by a planck spectrum when the flux is much less than the peak flux , results that hint at this effect .",
    "it is possible that conventional model atmospheres provide good descriptions of burst spectra when the flux is much less that the eddington flux .",
    "as discussed in section  2 , measurement of a bose - einstein spectrum with a temperature greater than implies that the radiative flux at the emitting surface exceeds the eddington flux , independent of unknowns such as the distance to the source , the radiating area on the star , the radius of the star , and its surface redshift .",
    "the implied fluxes are accurate , because the 260  kev bandpass of the pca captures more than 95% of the flux of a 3.0  kev bose - einstein spectrum with @xmath81 .",
    "we have found that intervals with temperatures greater than @xmath02  kev occur during most bursts , suggesting that the radiative flux exceeds the eddington flux during most bursts . when combined with the flux profiles seen during pre bursts from some of these same stars , these results , and the small effective areas inferred during high - temperature intervals ,",
    "indicate that most of the emission during these intervals comes from only a fraction ( in some cases @xmath020% ) of the stellar surface .",
    "these high temperatures and fluxes and small emitting areas raise several important questions : how can the flux be super - eddington without producing a significant wind ? what determines the maximum flux from the emitting area , and",
    "how big is it ? and how do these results fit with evidence that the emitting surface is sometimes far above the stellar surface ?",
    "we suggest that the radiative flux can exceed the eddington flux because the emitting gas is confined by a tangled stellar magnetic field .",
    "the sudden nuclear energy release that produces a burst creates a zone of turbulent convection at densities @xmath0 10@xmath82  g  @xmath83 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the convective energy flux is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the density in the convection zone and @xmath86 is the turbulent velocity there .",
    "the convection will amplify and tangle the star s weak poloidal magnetic field until the tangled field @xmath87 becomes strong enough to inhibit convection , which occurs when @xmath88 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath87 is @xmath89 and is relatively insensitive to @xmath85 and @xmath90 . for typical densities in the convection zone and",
    "the highest energy fluxes observed from the emitting surface , which are @xmath010@xmath91  erg  @xmath92  s@xmath4 , @xmath93 is @xmath94  g , @xmath010100 times stronger than the dipole components inferred from observations and theoretical modeling ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the tangled field will be strong enough to confine the emitting gas if its tension , @xmath95 , exceeds the outward radiation force , @xmath96 . here",
    "@xmath97 is the characteristic scale of the tangled field and @xmath98 is the electron density in the radiative zone .",
    "assuming @xmath97 is no larger than the depth @xmath010@xmath1  cm of the burning zone , a field @xmath0@xmath93 can confine the atmosphere in the presence of a radiative flux @xmath99  erg  @xmath92  s@xmath4 , which is the flux implied by an effective temperature @xmath100  kev .",
    "a neutron star atmosphere supported by a super - eddington radiative flux and confined by magnetic stresses is likely to be more extended and have a lower density than a conventional atmosphere supported by gas pressure and confined by gravity . in a future paper ( lamb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , we show that such an atmosphere naturally produces a bose - einstein photon spectrum with @xmath12 .",
    "comptonization by the electrons in the atmosphere drives the photon distribution close to a bose - einstein distribution while weak free - free and cyclotron emission drive the chemical potential to a small value ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that a region of very hot , confined gas will heat adjacent areas of the stellar surface , which may not be confined by a strong magnetic field .",
    "when these adjacent areas become hot enough , they will expand vertically . if the product of the radiative flux from the very hot , confined gas and its emitting area exceeds the eddington luminosity , adjacent gas will leave the star as a wind , producing a pre event .",
    "hence the maximum radiative luminosity will be approximately the eddington luminosity , just as in the conventional picture , even though heat is flowing from below the atmosphere over only a fraction of the stellar surface .",
    "the pre will end when the _ luminosity _ of the very hot , confined gas falls below the eddington luminosity , even if the local _ flux _ from this gas exceeds the eddington flux .",
    "the high temperatures and radiative fluxes and small emitting areas found here , which were first noted nearly three decades ago , have important implications for efforts to determine neutron star masses and radii using bursts .",
    "for example , it is often assumed that during high - temperature intervals the entire stellar surface emits exactly the eddington flux .",
    "our analysis of spectral measurements made using _",
    "rxte _ shows that these assumptions must be reconsidered .",
    "we thank sudip bhattacharyya , duncan galloway , fotis gavriil , ka - ho lo , and tod strohmayer for helpful advice .",
