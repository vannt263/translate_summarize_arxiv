    "the years since the first proposals to realise strongly correlated many - body states of light in resonator array architectures @xcite have seen a rapid growth of interest in these structures along several lines of investigation .",
    "perhaps most recently , there has been significant attention paid to finding novel observable non - equilibrium dynamical effects in modest - sized arrays , both in the steady state of driven - dissipative systems @xcite , and in explorations of coherent array dynamics @xcite .",
    "resonator arrays are in many ways ideal platforms for the exploration of non - equilibrium quantum phenomena , allowing relative ease of access to dynamical observables via localised measurements of photon fields .    in this work",
    "we investigate the time evolution of nonlinear arrays , going beyond the one- or two- photon limit into a strongly - correlated many - body regime .",
    "we find evidence for an interaction - induced ` freezing ' of domain walls of photons in initially half - filled one dimensional array systems .",
    "the resonator nonlinearity must be sufficiently large for localisation effects to set in , beyond which the photon population remains trapped in half of the system .",
    "we show that a semiclassical treatment similar to that first presented in @xcite for the limiting case of two coupled resonators predicts a sharp transition between localised domain formation and delocalised dynamics in which photons tunnel between both halves of the system .",
    "resonators ( here @xmath0 ) is initialised in a fock state of @xmath1 photons ( in this particular schematic , @xmath2 ) .",

    "going beyond the semiclassical approach , fully quantum calculations confirm the frozen photon dynamics for strongly nonlinear arrays while also revealing features not present in the semiclassical calculation .",
    "our findings can be seen in some ways as a photonic analog of the non - equilibrium dynamics of xxz chains where it has been recently shown that strong nearest - neighbor interactions can lead to the formation of polarised domains which strongly influence the transport properties of spin chains @xcite .",
    "these ferromagnetic domains have been shown to be stable .",
    "they are spectrally separated from mobile states of the system which are capable of breaking them .",
    "we show a related but distinct photonic equivalent .",
    "our ` domains ' of photons remain trapped over timescales large with respect to characteristic system rates due to a vanishing overlap between the initial pumped states we consider , and propagating modes of the system in the limit of large local interactions .",
