    "in their pre - main - sequence phase , low mass stars accrete high angular momentum material from a circumstellar disk . the star remains a comparatively slow rotator , however , apparently due to disk - locking , i.e. , magnetic braking by large - scale stellar field lines that thread the disk . in the classical t tauri phase",
    ", the fields may also mediate accretion by truncating the inner disk and channeling in infalling material ( knigl 1991 ; ostriker & shu 1995 ) .",
    "while many independent observations support this picture for stars with masses @xmath20.2@xmath3 , whether it applies to objects at or below the hydrogen - burning limit is only now being explored .",
    "the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs are still open to debate .",
    "most recently , padoan & nordlund ( 2002 ) have argued that brown dwarfs form in the same way as more massive stars , via ` turbulent fragmentation ' .",
    "reipurth & clarke ( 2001 ) , on the other hand , suggested that brown dwarfs are stellar embryos ejected from newborn multiple systems before they accreted sufficient mass to eventually start hydrogen burning . in this model , dynamical interactions are expected to prune their disks .",
    "studies of disk accretion , rotation and activity in young brown dwarfs could help distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "in particular , it is of considerable interest to investigate whether some or all young sub - stellar objects undergo a t tauri - like phase and if so how long that phase lasts .",
    "accretion signatures have been seen already in high - resolution spectra of a few very low mass sources .",
    "muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) detected an asymmetric h@xmath1 line profile in the m6 object v410 anon 13 in taurus and used magnetospheric accretion models to show that it is accreting from a disk but at a much lower rate than that found in higher mass stars .",
    "white & basri ( 2002 ) found two more taurus m5.5-m6.5 objects with h@xmath1 profiles similar to other classical t tauri stars .",
    "here we present high - resolution optical spectroscopy of a much larger sample of objects near or below the sub - stellar limit in the nearby ( @xmath4 150 pc ) upper scorpius and @xmath0 ophiuchus star - forming regions .",
    "our targets are sources with m5 or later spectral types from the surveys of ardila , martn , & basri ( 2000 ) for upper sco and wilking , greene & meyer ( 1999 ) for @xmath0 oph .",
    "our goals are to search for broad , asymmetric h@xmath1 lines indicative of disk accretion , to measure rotational properties as denoted by _ v  sin",
    "i _ , and to investigate chromospheric activity , in these young very low mass objects in comparison to their older counterparts in the field and to ( higher - mass ) t tauri stars .    in a subsequent paper ( mohanty et al .",
    ", in prep ) , we will use these optical spectra , together with observed photometry and theoretical isochrones , to derive effective temperatures , gravities , masses and ages for our sample objects .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we assume an age of @xmath4 1 myr for @xmath0 oph and @xmath4 5 myr for upper sco ( preibisch & zinnecker 1999 ) .",
    "if we also assume that the effective temperatures of our young m5-m8 objects are comparable to those of field m dwarfs of the same spectral type ( @xmath4 3000 - 2500 k , similar to what is derived by wilking , greene & meyer 1999 for their @xmath0 oph sample ) , then theoretical models ( chabrier et al . 2000 ) imply masses of @xmath4 0.1  0.02 @xmath3 .",
    "thus , our sample spans a mass range from the stellar / sub - stellar boundary well into the brown dwarf domain .",
    "we obtained optical spectra of the target sample using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) on the keck i telescope on 2002 may 19 and 20 ut . with the 1.15  slit ,",
    "the two - pixel - binned spectral resolution is r @xmath5 33,000 .",
    "the instrument yielded 15 spectral orders in the 6390  8700    wavelength range , with gaps between the orders , providing a variety of features related to youth and accretion activity .",
    "for comparison to our targets and to derive _ v  sin  i _ , we used m dwarf and m giant spectroscopic standards observed with the same hires set up .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard manner using idl routines , as described in basri et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we derived rotational velocities ( @xmath6 ) of the targets by cross - correlating with a ` spun - up ' template of a slowly rotating standard .",
    "multiple spectral orders ( @xmath4 6 ) , selected on the basis of an absence of strong telluric features , strong gravity - sensitive features , and stellar emission lines , were used in the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "following white & basri ( 2002 ) , we used a combination of giant and dwarf spectra for the template .",
    "table 1 lists the equivalent widths of li i and h@xmath1 lines , full widths at 10% of the peak flux level of h@xmath1 , and @xmath6 values of our sample , along with the relevant error estimates . of our 14 targets in upper sco ,",
    "11 show lithium 6708    absorption and have similar radial velocities ( standard deviation @xmath4 2 kms@xmath7 ) .",
    "the remaining three ( usco 85 , usco 99 and usco 121 ) do not show lithium , and are likely non - members ; we do not discuss them further . except for gy 5",
    ", our @xmath0 oph sources do not have sufficient signal - to - noise in the blue to measure li equivalent widths , primarily because they suffer from significant extinction .",
    "however , their membership in the @xmath0 oph molecular cloud has been established by wilking , greene & meyer ( 1999 ) using near - infrared photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "figure 1 shows h@xmath1 line profiles of our sample .",
    "the @xmath0 oph source gy 5 exhibits a broad , asymmetric h@xmath1 profile while none of the upper sco targets do .",
    "there is evidence of a measurable change in the h@xmath1 emission of usco 128 between two observations separated by about an hour .      accreting ( `` classical '' ) t tauri stars exhibit strong , broad h@xmath1 line profiles indicative of high velocities in a nearly free - falling flow ( e.g. , hartmann , hewett , & calvet 1994 ) .",
    "weak - line t tauri stars , on the other hand , harbor weak , narrow h@xmath1 lines , presumably originating in their active chromospheres .",
    "the equivalent width of the h@xmath1 line is often used to distinguish between these two types of objects .",
    "however , the threshold value of h@xmath1 equivalent width depends on the spectral type ( martn 1998 ) .",
    "white & basri ( 2002 ) suggested full - width at 10% of the peak emission as a more accurate empirical indicator of accretion than either the h@xmath1 equivalent width or optical veiling : 10% widths @xmath2 270 kms@xmath7 indicate accretion _ independent of the stellar spectral type_.    the @xmath0 oph source gy 5 has a 10% h@xmath1 width of 352 kms@xmath7 ( and an equivalent width of 65   ): it appears to be undergoing accretion .",
    "interestingly , it is one of the sources with a mid - infrared excess detected by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , consistent with the presence of a circumstellar disk ( comeron et al .",
    "1998 ; bontemps et al . 2001 ; natta et al . 2002 ) .",
    "thus , gy 5 may be the first spectroscopically confirmed sub - stellar object with an accreting disk detected via infrared excess as well as h@xmath1 characteristics .",
    "surprisingly , wilking , greene , & meyer ( 1999 ) did not see h@xmath1 emission ( @xmath8 5  ) in their low - resolution optical spectrum of gy 5 ( albeit obtained `` under nonideal conditions '' ) .",
    "it may be that the accretion onto gy 5 is highly variable ( or highly asymmetric so that geometric effects are important ) .    according to iso mid - infrared flux measurements , gy 141 and gy 310 also harbor excess emission but gy 37 does not ( comeron et al .",
    "1998 ; bontemps et al . 2001 ) .",
    "h@xmath1 line profiles in our optical spectra do not show clear evidence of on - going accretion in any of these three objects . given the problems of extinction",
    ", it would be interesting to obtain near - infrared spectra of all @xmath0 oph sources to investigate other accretion signatures such as pa @xmath9 and br @xmath10 . given the large iso beam , it would also be prudent to confirm via high angular resolution observations ( e.g. , ground - based l- and n - band imaging ) that the mid - infrared sources indeed coincide with the brown dwarfs .    by the white & basri ( 2002 ) criterion , none of the upper sco objects in our sample shows evidence of on - going accretion .",
    "the case of usco 128 , however , is intriguing . in low - resolution spectra ,",
    "ardila et al . (",
    "2000 ) reported a ` constant ' h@xmath1 equivalent width of 130    in two observations separated by a month .",
    "our two hires spectra , separated by just one hour , yield equivalent widths of 16 and 25  ; i.e. , there was a measurable change in the line over a short time interval ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . while it is true that low - resolution spectra of late - type objects systematically overestimate h@xmath1 as a result of blending with the 6569    tio band - head , a factor of @xmath45 difference between the ardila et al . ( 2000 ) values and ours is difficult to account for in this way .",
    "however , variation in the h@xmath1 width by more than a factor of 5 is not uncommon in flares .",
    "it may be that chromospheric activity in usco 128 is highly variable . in that case , the large width reported by ardila et al .",
    "( 2000 ) may correspond to a period of sustained high activity and flaring .",
    "the mean age of stars in the upper sco region is @xmath45 myr whereas @xmath0 oph sources are even younger at @xmath41 myr ( e.g. , preibisch & zinnecker 1999 ) .",
    "our results suggest that if most brown dwarfs are born with disks , their accretion rates decrease rapidly , within the first few million years .",
    "such a conclusion is also consistent with measurements of disk frequency as a function of age using infrared excess . while a large fraction @xmath460% of brown dwarf candidates in the @xmath41-myr - old trapezium cluster show near - infrared excess ( muench et al .",
    "2001 ) , the fraction appears to be much lower in the somewhat older @xmath11 orionis ( @xmath43 - 8 myr ) and tw hydrae ( @xmath410 myr ) associations ( jayawardhana , ardila & stelzer 2002 ) .",
    "thus , it appears that at least the inner disks of brown dwarfs deplete rather quickly , at timescales comparable to or smaller than those for t tauri stars ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "disk dissipation timescales in upper sco might be even shorter than in some other star - forming regions due to strong winds and ionizing radiation from numerous luminous stars in its midst ( preibisch & zinnecker 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "studies of large samples of brown dwarfs in several young clusters , spanning a range of ages and environments , will provide a more definitive answer .",
    "measures of stellar rotation and chromospheric activity in young brown dwarfs , in comparison with their older counterparts in the field and higher - mass coeval t tauri stars , can shed light on a variety of questions , from the nature of sub - stellar magnetic fields to the efficiency of disk locking .",
    "a large fraction of the lowest - mass stars in orion appear to be fast rotators whereas taurus objects of similar spectral type rotate much more slowly ( clarke & bouvier 2000 ; herbst et al .",
    "2001 ; white & basri 2002 ) .",
    "according to a scenario advocated by hartmann ( 2002 ) , late - type orion objects have not yet had time to slow down via disk braking whereas ( somewhat older ) taurus objects have . in the standard picture , following disk unlocking , the low - mass stars ( and presumably brown dwarfs ) would spin up again .",
    "eventually , braking by magnetized winds is expected to slow the stars down again , though it appears that such braking may not be efficient in the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs ( mohanty & basri 2002a ; mohanty & basri 2002b ) . in the first few myr , in any case , contraction timescales are expected to be much shorter than braking timescales , so spin - up is expected to dominate ( once the disk locking ends ) over this period ( bouvier , forestini & allain 1997 ) .    among the @xmath0 oph targets , we find @xmath12 14 kms@xmath7 in gy 5 , which very likely harbors a disk .",
    "it is interesting to note that gy 141 and gy 310 , which also show mid - infrared excess , are relatively slow rotators ( @xmath4 6 and 10 , respectively ) while gy 37 , which does not show a mid - infrared excess , is a rapid rotator ( @xmath4 22 ) .",
    "this may be a hint of disk - locking in action , though further observations and a larger sample are required for verification .    among the 11 upper sco members in our sample ( all apparently non - accretors ) ,",
    "six show rotational velocities @xmath13 15 kms@xmath7 .",
    "the average @xmath6 of the upper sco sample is @xmath4 25 . in seven similar mass non - accretors in taurus , on the other hand , white & basri ( 2002 ) find an average @xmath6 of @xmath4 10 , with only one object rotating above 15 .",
    "thus , the upper sco brown dwarfs appear to be rotating noticeably faster than their taurus counterparts .",
    "since upper sco is believed to be somewhat older than taurus , we may be seeing the signature of spin - up due to gravitational contraction following disk unlocking .    in our upper sco sample ,",
    "the equivalent widths of h@xmath1 arising from chromospheric activity are in the range @xmath4 6 - 18    ( except one larger width in usco 128 ) . without accurate effective temperature determinations , we can not yet calculate the h@xmath1 fluxes these widths correspond to .",
    "however , the h@xmath1 widths are comparable to saturated widths in field m dwarfs of similar spectral type ( mohanty & basri 2002a ; mohanty & basri 2002b ) . thus , if the effective temperatures of the upper sco objects are similar to those of field dwarfs of the same spectral type , then their h@xmath1 fluxes would correspond to saturated levels in the field .",
    "this issue will be investigated further in a subsequent paper ( mohanty et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "we have explored disk accretion , stellar rotation and chromospheric activity in a substantial sample of young brown dwarfs in the upper sco and @xmath0 oph star - forming regions using high - resolution optical spectra from the hires instrument on the keck i telescope .",
    "we have detected evidence of accretion in the @xmath0 oph source gy 5 in the form of a broad , asymmetric h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "interestingly , gy 5 also has a mid - infrared excess detected by iso consistent with the presence of a disk .",
    "the h@xmath1 profiles of our upper sco targets suggest little or no on - going accretion .",
    "it appears that if most brown dwarfs are born with disks , their accretion rates decrease rapidly , on timescales comparable to or shorter than those for t tauri disks . on average ,",
    "the upper sco brown dwarfs are rotating faster than their somewhat younger counterparts in taurus , which may be a hint of spin - up due to contraction once the disk locking has ended .",
    "their chromospheric activity levels , as indicated by h@xmath1 , are comparable to the saturated activity levels seen in field objects of similar spectral type",
    ". our results , in comparison with similar studies of other young clusters spanning a range of ages and environments , will help unveil the origin and early evolution of sub - stellar objects .",
    "we thank the keck observatory staff for their outstanding support , and david ardila , beate stelzer and russel white for useful conversations .",
