    "a basic question in hadronic physics concerns the properties of constituents as they are embedded in a nuclear medium .",
    "such medium effects are commonly treated in terms of self energies from which effective masses and decay widths are deduced .",
    "electroproduction of charged pions from @xmath0he represents a viable testing ground to study the influence of the nuclear medium on the production and propagation of mesons and nucleon resonances such as the pion and the @xmath2 resonance . as a simple composite nucleus",
    ", @xmath0he is amenable to precise microscopic calculations of the wave function and other ground state properties  @xcite and offers the great advantage that effects of final state interaction are expected to be much smaller than in heavier nuclei .",
    "moreover , the mass - three nucleus may already be considered as a medium . in this letter , we present the results of an experiment which allows the determination of the self energies of the pion and the @xmath2 isobar from the analysis of the longitudinal and transverse cross section components , respectively .",
    "these self - energy terms are the subject of theoretical descriptions in the framework of the @xmath2-hole model  @xcite and chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite .",
    "to this end , we have measured the @xmath0he(e , e@xmath1)@xmath0h reaction in a kinematically complete experiment at the high - resolution three - spectrometer facility  @xcite of the a1 collaboration at the 855 mev mainz microtron ( mami ) .",
    "the specific experimental arrangements of the present experiment , including that of the cryogenic gas target and the data acquisition and analyses methods are described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the very high missing mass resolution of @xmath12 kev / c@xmath13 ( fwhm ) is quite adequate  @xcite to clearly isolate the coherent channel ( @xmath0h@xmath1 ) from the three- and four - body final states ( nd@xmath1 ) and ( nnp@xmath1 ) .",
    "the three - fold differential pion electroproduction cross section with unpolarized electron beam and target can be written as  @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 here the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the polarization and flux of the virtual photon .",
    "the indices @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath18 refer to the transverse and longitudinal components and their interferences , respectively . the explicit dependence of @xmath19 on the azimuthal pion angle @xmath20 and the polarization @xmath21 is used for a separation of the response functions .",
    "the measurements were carried out at two four - momentum transfers @xmath22 and 0.100 ( gev / c)@xmath7 , referred to as kinematics 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the energy transfer in the laboratory frame has been chosen at @xmath23 and 394 mev , respectively , i.e. in the @xmath2 resonance region . at each @xmath24 ,",
    "three measurements in parallel kinematics with various values of @xmath21 were made to determine the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cross sections ( rosenbluth separation ) .",
    "parallel kinematics implies that the pion is detected in the direction of the three momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "we have also measured the in - plane pion angular distribution ( i.e. @xmath25 or @xmath26 , respectively ) for the second kinematics at @xmath27 to determine the @xmath5 term .",
    "parts of the experimental results together with model interpretations have already been presented elsewhere  @xcite . in this letter , we offer a combined analysis of the entire data set of the experiments in the two kinematics and draw definitive conclusions about medium effects , which are especially well understood for the pion .",
    "the data are shown as solid dots .",
    "the shaded areas are error bands of a straight line fit to the data . also shown are the fit results for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 components with statistical errors .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines are pwia and dwia results , respectively .",
    "the dash - dotted lines include the @xmath2 self - energy term , while the solid lines contain both the @xmath2 and pion self - energy terms . ]",
    "the results of the rosenbluth separation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosen ] where the cross sections are displayed as a function of the virtual photon polarization .",
    "the longitudinal cross section is identified as the slope , while the transverse one is given by the intercept with the axis at @xmath28 .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosen ] are the fit results for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 components with statistical errors .",
    "the systematic errors amount to 10  % ( 8  % ) for kinematics 1 ( 2 ) , respectively .",
    "the theoretical calculations are based on the most recent elementary pion production amplitude in the framework of the so - called unitary isobar model  @xcite . in plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , the amplitude includes the born terms as well as @xmath2- and higher resonance terms . for the mass - three nuclei ,",
    "realistic three - body faddeev wave functions are employed . in the distorted - wave ( dwia )",
    "calculations , the final state interaction due to pion rescattering is included  @xcite . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosen ] , the dwia calculations underestimate the longitudinal component and overestimate the transverse component , each by about a factor of two .",
    "since the longitudinal component is dominated by the pion - pole term and a large part of the transverse part arises from the @xmath2 resonance excitation , both the pion and the @xmath2 propagators have to be modified ( see also @xcite ) . in parallel kinematics",
    "the pion - pole term only contributes to the longitudinal part of the cross section , while the @xmath2 excitation is almost purely transverse .",
    "therefore the pion - pole and the @xmath2 contribution essentially decouple in the longitudinal and transverse channel and can be studied separately .",
    "we next discuss the estimate of these terms .      the inadequacy of the dwia to account for the longitudinal response ( cf .",
    "[ fig : rosen ] ) is remedied by replacing the free pion propagator in the t - channel pion - pole term of the elementary amplitude , @xmath29^{-1}$ ] , by a modified one , @xmath30^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath31 denotes the pion self energy in the nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "for the two values of @xmath24 , the energy @xmath32 and the momentum @xmath33 of the virtual pion are fixed as @xmath34 1.7 ( 4.1 ) mev and @xmath35 80.9 ( 141.2 ) mev / c , such that two experimental numbers for @xmath36 can be determined from a fit to the respective longitudinal cross sections .",
    "the best - fit values result in @xmath37 for kinematics 1 and @xmath38 for kinematics 2 .",
    "close to the static limit , i.e. for @xmath39 , appropriate for the kinematical conditions of the present experiment , the pion self energy can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the proton and neutron densities , @xmath43  mev the @xmath44 sigma term  @xcite , @xmath45  mev the pion decay constant , and @xmath46 the p - wave pionic susceptibility .",
    "since the virtual @xmath1 propagates in a triton - like medium , we have @xmath47 .",
    "in infinite nuclear matter with fermi momentum @xmath48 , the p - wave pionic susceptibility @xmath46 can be approximated by a constant for @xmath49 , and we will assume that this is also the case here , although a local density approximation for such a small nucleus may be questionable . with the two values for @xmath36 given above , we immediately obtain @xmath50 . on the other hand , a standard calculation with particle - hole ( ph ) and @xmath2-hole ( @xmath2h ) susceptibilities ( see e.g. @xcite ) for infinite isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter results already at small densities in much higher values for @xmath51 .",
    "for example , with @xmath52 ( @xmath53  @xmath9 being the saturation density ) , @xmath47 and the migdal parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we find @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pi ] ) .",
    "this is principally due to the large contribution of the ph lindhard function which , at @xmath57 , is proportional to @xmath48 and therefore does not change appreciably if one reduces the density within a reasonable range .",
    "one obvious improvement is the use of an energy gap in the ph - spectrum at the fermi surface .",
    "it accounts in an average way for the low - lying excitation spectrum of a finite nucleus  @xcite . using a gap of 8.5 mev , appropriate for the continuum threshold of the triton , leads to a reduction of @xmath51 but is still not able to describe the slope of @xmath36 inferred from the measurement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pi ] ) .     near @xmath39 .",
    "the data points with the error bars are from the longitudinal cross sections .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to @xmath58 from the lindhard function with @xmath59  @xmath9 .",
    "the dashed line results after taking into account a gap of 8.5 mev for the ph excitation energy , i.e. the binding energy of @xmath60h . the solid line results from a fit of @xmath51 and @xmath61 to the data according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pionself1 ] ) . ]",
    "this indicates that the use of the bulk - matter lindhard function is not appropriate for such a small nucleus and the kinematics probed in the experiment .",
    "therefore we do not attempt to calculate @xmath51 but rather use the above value @xmath50 from experiment .",
    "this allows an extrapolation of the self energy to @xmath62 and to determine the mean density experienced by the virtual pion , with the result @xmath63  @xmath64 , albeit with a large error .",
    "the self energy corresponding to the best fit is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi ] .    for further physical interpretation of the measurement we use guidance from chpt to infer the effective @xmath1 mass at the density probed in the present experiment .",
    "given the above mentioned uncertainties in the use of the local density approximation for the medium modification of the pion in very light nuclei these results should be regarded as qualitative .",
    "the effective mass can be obtained from an extrapolation of the pion self energy to the mass shell . up to second order in @xmath32 and @xmath65 , the self energy of a charged pion in homogeneous , spin - saturated , but isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter in the vicinity of @xmath66 and for @xmath62 is given by the expansion @xmath67 where the @xmath68 signs refer to the respective charge state of the pion ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the low - energy constants ( lec s ) @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the chiral lagrangian and the @xmath44 sigma term @xmath71 characterize the @xmath44 interaction and are related to the @xmath44 scattering lengths .",
    "we use @xmath72  mev  @xcite , but one should remark here that third - order corrections may change the lec s somewhat  @xcite .",
    "the pion self energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pionself2 ] ) consists of two isoscalar parts proportional to @xmath61 and @xmath73 , respectively , and an isovector part proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "the latter is known as the `` tomozawa - weinberg term ''  @xcite . based on pcac arguments ,",
    "it reflects the isovector dominance of the @xmath44 interaction at @xmath75 , where the isoscalar scattering length as given by the first coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pionself2 ] ) vanishes at leading order .",
    "the second isoscalar term proportional to @xmath73 is caused by s - wave pion scattering from correlated nucleon pairs  @xcite .",
    "the sign of the tomozawa - weinberg term depends on the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear medium . in the present case of a virtual @xmath1 propagating in a triton - like medium with @xmath76 ,",
    "the isovector term becomes attractive .",
    "the first and the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pionself1 ] ) are repulsive while the third term is repulsive for @xmath77 and attractive for @xmath1 and causes the mass splitting . ]",
    "[ fig : pionmassshift ]    the effective @xmath1 mass @xmath78 is deduced from the pole of the pion propagator at @xmath62 which is determined by the solution of @xmath79 with the self energy as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pionself2 ] ) . using @xmath80 @xmath9 ,",
    "one obtains a mass shift @xmath81 mev / c@xmath7 when the @xmath1 propagates in @xmath0h .",
    "it is interesting to compare the determined negative mass shift @xmath82 with a positive mass shift @xmath83 derived from deeply bound pionic states  @xcite in @xmath84pb and @xmath85pb with @xmath86 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have reported a strong repulsion of 23 to 27  mev due to the local potential @xmath87 for a deeply bound @xmath77 in the center of the neutron - rich @xmath84pb nucleus .",
    "evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq : pionself2 ] ) for this case with @xmath88 and @xmath89 one calculates @xmath90 mev .",
    "this is in good agreement with the findings of ref .",
    "yet , there remains the problem of a `` missing repulsion '' in the interpretation of the pionic atom data .",
    "figure  [ fig : pionmassshift ] shows the contributions to the pion mass shift in @xmath0h : the two isoscalar contributions to @xmath36 are both repulsive and increase the pion mass .",
    "one thus notices from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pionself2 ] ) that at @xmath91 already the isoscalar contribution to the self energy is sizeable . for a neutron - rich nucleus",
    "the isovector @xmath44 interactions are attractive ( repulsive ) for @xmath92 giving rise to a splitting of the mass shifts ( contribution 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pionmassshift ] ) . in @xmath0h , the isoscalar and isovector",
    "terms are compensating each other to a large extent , resulting in the very small decrease of the @xmath1 mass .",
    "most of the dwia overestimate in the transverse channel ( cf .",
    "[ fig : rosen ] ) is removed by a medium modification of the @xmath2 isobar .",
    "the in - medium @xmath2 propagator is written  @xcite as @xmath93^{-1}$ ] , where one introduces a complex self - energy term @xmath94 in the free @xmath2 propagator .",
    "besides this explicit medium modification of the production amplitude also the dwia formalism for the pion - nucleus rescattering effectively accounts for a @xmath2 modification in the medium  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath94 has been deduced from an energy - dependent fit to a large set of @xmath10 photoproduction data  @xcite from @xmath11he and also consistently describes recent photoproduction data from @xmath95c , @xmath96ca and @xmath97pb  @xcite .",
    "the fitting procedure reported in  @xcite has been redone with the unitary phase excluded from the propagator in accordance with prescriptions often used in the @xmath2-hole model  @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 self energy exhibits a dependence on the photon energy .",
    "evaluated for the kinematics 1 and 2 , which correspond to the photon equivalent energies @xmath98 and 376 mev , respectively , the real and imaginary parts are @xmath99 and 39 mev and @xmath100 and @xmath101 mev .",
    "although quite large values are obtained in view of the small density @xmath102 , one should stress that the on - shell @xmath2 self energy at resonance position is numerically considerably smaller  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the agreement with the transverse cross section is significantly improved , although the experimental values are still overestimated by about 30% .",
    "the remaining discrepancy may be due to additional theoretical uncertainties .",
    "for example , the fermi motion of the nucleons is effectively accounted for by a factorization ansatz  @xcite .",
    "an exact treatment might reduce the prediction of the transverse cross section by about 10% . a second uncertainty of the order of 10% concerns the knowledge of the elementary @xmath1 production amplitude at @xmath103 .",
    "this kinematical region is not probed in photoproduction but may be accessible in the future with appropriate electroproduction data from the proton . attributing the entire @xmath2 self energy to a mass shift @xmath104 and a width change @xmath105 , we deduce an increase by 40 to 50 mev and 60 to 70 mev , respectively .",
    "these values seemingly differ from our earlier results  @xcite , where we have employed the parameterization from ref .",
    "@xcite which did not include the @xmath2-hole interaction , giving @xmath106 mev for a mean @xmath60he density of @xmath107 @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "the self - energy term of the present work is an effective parameter which incorporates the influence of the @xmath2-spreading potential , pauli- and binding effects as well as the @xmath2-hole interaction including the lorentz - lorenz correction .",
    "this finally leads to the positive sign .",
    "the effects of the medium modifications were also examined in the angular distribution of the produced pions in kinematics 2 .",
    "the data along with the model calculations are shown in the l.h.s .",
    "[ fig : angdistri ] .",
    "( gev / c)@xmath7 . r.h.s . : the @xmath5 term of the differential cross section .",
    "the labeling is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosen ] . ]",
    "the asymmetry of the combined distribution is due to a finite @xmath5 interference term . from the azimuthal dependence on @xmath108 for three",
    "polar angle bins @xmath109 we extract the @xmath5 interference term as a function of the pion emission angle @xmath110 , as shown in the r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : angdistri ] along with the comparison to the model calculations .",
    "it is obvious that only the full calculation , incorporating the medium modifications in the pion and @xmath2 propagators , is able to reproduce the angular distributions .",
    "in summary , in a kinematically complete experiment , we have measured the longitudinal and transverse cross section as well as the @xmath5 interference term for the first time in the @xmath0he(e , e@xmath1)@xmath0h reaction .",
    "the high sensitivity of the electroproduction cross section shows clear evidence for self - energy corrections in both the pion and @xmath2-isobar propagators and complements the large body of previous results from pion - nucleus data . using chpt",
    "we have extrapolated the pion self energy determined from the present experiment to the mass shell to deduce the effective @xmath1 mass in @xmath0h .",
    "although qualitative , the results appear to be consistent with the theoretical analysis of deeply bound pionic atoms and the deduced effective @xmath111 mass  @xcite . in the transverse channel ,",
    "the medium modification of the @xmath2 isobar is also evident and the self - energy modifications inferred from the present measurements conform with @xmath10 photoproduction data over a wide mass range .",
