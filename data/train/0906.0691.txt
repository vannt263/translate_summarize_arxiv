    "the absorption of fuv photons by dust grains leads to the ejection of photoelectrons that heat the gas ( _ e.g. , _ draine 1978 ) as well as to intense fir dust continuum emission .",

    "radiative transitions between the @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath23@xmath0 states lead to the widespread [ oi]63 and 145@xmath3 m line emission respectively .",
    "observations and models of such lines are crucial diagnostics of a broad range of galactic and extragalactic environments ( see hollenbach & tielens 1999 for a review ) .    in this letter",
    ", we present the first detection of the [ oi]63@xmath3 m line toward the horsehead pdr ( @xmath25@xmath2400pc , edge - on ) , one of the most famous fuv - induced chemical laboratories in the sky .",
    "we analyze the fir line and continuum emission without strong simplifying assumptions in the excitation and radiative transfer treatment .",
    "the horsehead nebula was observed with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) as part of our `` specpdr '' program ( id:20281 ; joblin et al .",
    "2005 ) on 2006 april  3 using the spectral energy distribution mode ( hereafter mips / sed ) .",
    "mips / sed provided the capability of obtaining low  resolution spectra ( @xmath26 ) in the fir range ( @xmath27 m ) using a slit spectrometer and the mips70 ge : ga detector array .",
    "the slit size has two detector pixels in width ( @xmath220@xmath28 ) and 12 pixels in length ( @xmath22@xmath29 ) .",
    "a reflective grating provides a spectral dispersion of 1.7@xmath3 m pixel@xmath30 .",
    "we used the `` spectral mapping '' mode and covered the horsehead with 14 pointings shifted by half the slit width in the direction perpendicular to the slit length .",
    "the exposure time was 10s per pointing .",
    "the `` chop distance '' for the off positions was set to + 3@xmath29 for each pointing .",
    "both on and off  source areas are shown in fig.[fig : show_area]@xmath31 .",

    "we compute the flat response of the detector columns using the off positions .",
    "we have developed a pipeline that builds spectral cubes ( two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension ) from the post - bcd data .",
    "we work in the assumption that no spatial information is available in the slit width .",
    "thus , the @xmath32 rows of the detector can be seen as images of the sky through the slit for @xmath32 sampled wavelengths between 55 and 97@xmath3 m . for each wavelength",
    ", this image of the slit is reprojected into a @xmath33 spatial grid of the sky .",

    "the pixel size of the spatial grid is half of each detector pixel field  of  view , pfov ( 9.8/2 = 4.9  ) .",
    "nevertheless , due to dispersion , the light that falls on a pixel comes from the entire slit width , that is two times the pixel size , so that the pfov is rather @xmath35 .",
    "this leads to an overestimation of the intensity of a factor 2 that we take into account here . for extended sources ,",
    "one also has to correct for the effect of the aperture used for the photometric calibration with point sources .",
    "we then divide the intensity by the 5 pixels aperture correction function ( see mips data handbook ) .",
    "the photometry of the resulting spectral cubes ( for all sources in our program ) were checked by cross - calibrating them with mips70 data when available .",
    "it appears that the mips / sed gain is 30% higher than the mips70 one .",
    "on the basis that the photometer calibration is more reliable , we apply this 30% correction to our mips / sed data and use the mips70 absolute calibration uncertainty of 7% .",

    "besides , cloud inclination variations ( relative to the line of sight ) from north to south , and thus differential line opacity effects , likely explain the brighter [ oi]63@xmath3 m emission observed toward the north of the filament .    the [ oi]63@xmath3 m line intensity toward the emission peak , as measured over the @xmath215  full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) angular resolution of mips at 63@xmath3 m ( circle on fig.[fig : show_area]@xmath37 ) , is @xmath6=(1.04@xmath430.14)@xmath810@xmath44  wm@xmath45sr@xmath30 ( @xmath24 times brighter than the h@xmath18 @xmath38=10 @xmath39(1 ) fluorescent emission at 2.12@xmath3 m ; see habart et al .",

    "apart from this [ oi]63@xmath3 m bright emission toward the cloud edge , the mips data show a fainter level of widespread emission ( @xmath24 times weaker ) likely arising from the more diffuse cloud envelope , or halo , illuminated by the ambient fuv radiation field .",

    "almost all studies solving the excitation of atomic fine structure levels simplify the problem by assuming a _ local _ treatment of the excitation calculation : _ lvg _ or single - zone escape probability methods ( _ e.g. , _ rllig et al . 2007 ) , where the source function ( the line emissivity / absorption ratio ) is assumed to be constant , and the radiative coupling between different cloud positions is neglected . the effects of dust opacity are also generally omitted ( gonzlez garca et al . 2008 ) .",
