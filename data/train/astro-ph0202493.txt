    "faint 15  @xmath0 m  surveys have revealed a large population of strongly evolving luminous infrared ( ir ) starbursts at @xmath4 ( e.g. ,  aussel 1999 ; elbaz 1999 ; elbaz 2002 ) .",
    "the space density of these sources is an order of magnitude higher than that found for luminous ir starbursts in the local universe ( i.e. ,  @xmath5 ) .",
    "although these sources only account for a small fraction of the star - forming galaxy population , they are likely to contribute a significant fraction of the star - formation history of the universe ( e.g. , chary & elbaz 2001 ; elbaz 2002 ) .    in this letter",
    "we use the 1  ms  deep field - north ( cdf - n ; brandt 2001b , hereafter paper v ) and  hdf - n ( aussel 1999 , 2002 ) surveys to show that these strongly evolving luminous ir starbursts are identified with the population of apparently normal galaxies detected in deep x - ray surveys ( e.g. ,  giacconi 2001 ; hornschemeier 2001 , hereafter paper ii ; brandt 2001a , hereafter paper iv ) .",
    "previous cross - identification studies have shown that @xmath3  20% of the  sources are agn - dominated ; however , few constraints have been placed on the larger fraction of  sources that do not have obvious agn activity ( e.g. ,  paper ii ; paper iv ; fadda 2002 ) .",
    "the primary focus of this paper is to place constraints on the x - ray properties of these sources .",
    "the galactic column density toward the cdf - n is @xmath6  @xmath7 ( stark 1992 ) , and @xmath8  km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are adopted throughout this letter .",
    "the 1  ms cdf - n observations were centered on the hdf - n ( williams 1996 ) and cover @xmath12  arcmin@xmath13 ( paper  v ) .",
    "the @xmath3  21.5  arcmin@xmath13 region of the cdf - n survey coincident with the 15  @xmath0 m  observations is close to the cdf - n aim point .",
    "forty - nine high - significance x - ray sources ( i.e. ,  wavdetect false - positive probability threshold of 10@xmath14 ) are detected in this area down to on - axis 0.52.0  kev ( soft - band ) and 28  kev ( hard - band ) flux limits of @xmath15  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath9 and @xmath16  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath9 , respectively ( paper v ) .",
    "the  observations were performed at 6.7  @xmath0 m and 15  @xmath0 m .",
    "because of the significantly smaller field - of - view of the 6.7  @xmath0 m observations and the small number of sources detected , only the 15  @xmath0 m observations are considered here .",
    "discrete sources are detected down to @xmath17  20  @xmath0jy , although the  observations are far from complete at this depth . in this study",
    "we focus on the 41 sources with @xmath18  100  @xmath0jy in the complete 15  @xmath0 m selected sample of aussel ( 2002 ) .",
    "optical ( @xmath19-band ) sources taken from the photometric catalog produced in alexander ( 2001b , hereafter paper vi ) were matched to x - ray and 15  @xmath0 m sources using matching radii of 1@xmath20  and 3@xmath20 , respectively ( see paper vi ; aussel 2002).-band photometric catalog was produced using the barger ( 1999 ) image publicly available from http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/@xmath21cowie/hdflank/hdflank.html . ]",
    "the 15  @xmath0 m sources have @xmath22  1823 , and all but one source have redshifts in the catalogs of cohen ( 2000 ) , cohen ( 2001 ) or dawson ( 2001 ) .",
    "by contrast , @xmath3  40% of the x - ray sources in the 15  @xmath0 m  region have @xmath23 , although all but two of the @xmath24 sources have redshifts",
    ".    in total 14 of the 41 15  @xmath0 m sources have x - ray counterparts in the high - significance x - ray source catalog.m counterparts .",
    "] however , given the comparitively low source density of 15  @xmath0 m sources , we can search for lower significance x - ray sources associated with 15  @xmath0 m sources without introducing a significant number of spurious x - ray detections .",
    "we ran wavdetect with a false - positive probability threshold of 10@xmath25 and found six further        [ fig : redshift1 ]    matches to 15  @xmath0 m sources ; we would expect @xmath3  0.01 of these six x - ray sources to be spurious .",
    "finally , we calculated x - ray upper limits for the 21 x - ray undetected 15  @xmath0 m sources following  3.2.1 of paper v. the fraction of 15  @xmath0 m sources with x - ray counterparts is @xmath26% ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "level ; these were calculated assuming poisson statistics . ]    we also matched the x - ray sources to the 15  @xmath0 m sources in the fainter 15  @xmath0 m sample of aussel ( 1999 ) and computed 15  @xmath0 m 3@xmath27 upper limits for all the x - ray sources without 15  @xmath0 m counterparts following aussel ( 2002 ) .",
    "five x - ray sources have 15  @xmath0 m detected counterparts with @xmath28  100  @xmath0jy ( see figure",
    "1 ) ; these 15  @xmath0 m sources fall below our sample threshold and are not included in any further discussion .",
    "we have classified our sources since agn - dominated sources are predicted to have different x - ray - to - ir flux ratios than non - agn dominated sources ( see barcons 1995 ; alexander 2001a ) .",
    "we adopt three source - type classifications : agn - dominated sources , emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) , and absorption - line galaxies ( algs ) .",
    "we considered a source to be agn - dominated if it has either a `` q '' ( i.e. ,  broad emission lines ) optical spectral classification from cohen ( 2000 ) , a rest - frame 0.58.0  kev        [ fig : redshift1 ]    luminosity @xmath29 erg  s@xmath9 , or a flat effective x - ray spectral slope ( i.e. ,  @xmath30 , an indicator of obscured agn activity ) . and",
    "no intrinsic or galactic absorption.]@xmath31 clearly there can be agn - dominated sources not selected by these criteria ( e.g. ,  an agn with @xmath32 and a rest - frame 0.58.0  kev luminosity @xmath33 erg  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "we considered a source to be an elg if it is not agn dominated and has a classification including an `` e '' or `` i '' in cohen ( 2000 ) .",
    "all sources with an `` a '' classification in cohen ( 2000 ) are considered algs ; algs comprise both elliptical and quiescent spiral galaxies and can be agn dominated .      in figure",
    "2 we show the full - band x - ray flux versus @xmath19-band magnitude for all of the 15  @xmath0 m and x - ray detected sources .",
    "almost all of the 19 agn - dominated sources have @xmath34 , consistent with the findings from previous x - ray surveys ( e.g. ,  schmidt 1998 ; akiyama 2000 ) .",
    "four agn - dominated sources have 15  @xmath0 m counterparts . the resulting fraction ( @xmath35% )",
    "is consistent with that found by fadda ( 2002 ) and should be considered an upper limit since many of the unclassified sources with @xmath34 are probably also agn dominated .",
    "these four agn - dominated sources are among the x - ray brightest sources ( i.e. ,  full - band fluxes @xmath36  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "assuming the highest x - ray - to - ir flux ratio of these agn - dominated sources [ i.e. , @xmath37  0.5 ] , an agn - dominated source at the x - ray flux limit of our survey will have @xmath17  1  @xmath0jy ; see  4 for discussion of deeper ir observations .",
    "fifteen of the 18 x - ray detected elgs have 15  @xmath0 m counterparts ; see figure  2 .",
    "the three sources not detected at 15  @xmath0 m have distinctive properties suggesting that their x - ray emission may well be agn dominated .",
    "for example , all three sources have hard - band counterparts while none of the 15 sources detected at 15  @xmath0 m has a hard - band counterpart .",
    "furthermore , one of the three sources has an x - ray - to - optical flux ratio typical of an agn - dominated source while another source is only detected in the hard band , suggesting it contains an obscured agn .",
    "these three 15  @xmath0 m undetected sources are excluded from further analysis of the x - ray detected elgs as they are probably agn dominated .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that up to 100% of the x - ray detected elgs ( without agn ) have 15  @xmath0 m counterparts . since 15  @xmath0",
    "m detected elgs only account for @xmath3  20% of the @xmath38 elg population in this region [ as determined from the cohen ( 2000 ) data ] , this implies an association between the production of x - ray and ir emission in these sources .",
    "all of the x - ray detected elgs have faint x - ray emission ( i.e. ,  full - band fluxes @xmath39  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath9 ) , showing clear differences in the x - ray - to - ir and x - ray - to - optical emission relationships of agn - dominated sources and x - ray detected elgs ( see figures  1 and 2 ) .",
    "while these sources are clearly not agn - dominated , a fraction may contain a hidden ( i.e. ,  obscured ) agn as revealed by a flat x - ray spectral slope .",
    "although none of the sources is detected in the hard band , we can stack the individual non - detections to provide a statistical constraint following  3.3 of paper vi .",
    "this provides a detection in the hard band corresponding to an average band ratio ( the ratio of hard - band to soft - band count rate ) of @xmath40 , corresponding to an effective photon index of @xmath41  2.0 . to help interpret this result",
    ", we also stacked the 17 optically faint ( i.e. ,  @xmath42 ) x - ray sources in paper vi with full - band fluxes @xmath39  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath9 ; the majority of these sources are thought to be obscured agn .",
    "the average band ratio from this stacking analysis is @xmath43 ( @xmath41  1.3 ) , substantially higher than that found for the elgs .",
    "the reason for this difference is clear : @xmath44% of the optically faint x - ray sources have hard - band detections .",
    "since we applied the same full - band flux limit to both samples , and thus took into account the high hard - band background , these results suggest a low fraction of obscured agn within the elg sample .",
    "only one ( @xmath45% ) of the eight x - ray detected algs has a 15  @xmath0 m counterpart , in stark contrast to the higher 15  @xmath0 m matching fraction found for the x - ray detected elgs ; see figure  2 .",
    "this difference could be due to either enhanced x - ray emission ( e.g. ,  an agn component ) or decreased ir emission ( e.g. ,  a weaker dust - emission component ) .",
    "indeed , two algs are classified as agn - dominated ( see figure  2 ) , and the radio properties of a further fraction also indicate agn activity ( bauer 2002 ) . however , if the absence of 15  @xmath0 m counterparts in the other sources is due to a weaker dust - emission component , then their 15  @xmath0 m emission is likely to be dominated by        [ fig : redshift1 ]    starlight . following ",
    "3.4.3 of alexander ( 2002 ) , the estimated 15  @xmath0 m flux densities from starlight for these sources are 540  @xmath0jy , below the flux threshold of the 15  @xmath0 m sample .",
    "direct evidence for starlight emission is found in one source that is detected at 6.7  @xmath0 m but not at 15  @xmath0 m ( cxohdfn  j123649.5 + 621345 ; see paper iv ) .",
    "our estimated 15  @xmath0 m flux density ( @xmath46  40  @xmath0jy ) is consistent with the upper limit for this source ( @xmath28  52  @xmath0jy ) .",
    "studies of the faint 15  @xmath0 m source population have shown that these sources are mostly luminous ir starburst galaxies undergoing intense dust - enshrouded star - formation activity that is re - radiated at ir wavelengths ( e.g. ,  chary & elbaz 2001 ) . by cross - identifying the sources detected in the 1  ms cdf - n and 15  @xmath0 m  hdf - n surveys , we have shown that this starburst population is associated with the population of apparently normal galaxies detected at faint x - ray fluxes ( e.g. ,  giacconi 2001 ; paper ii ; paper vi ) . with small x - ray - to - optical and x - ray - to - ir flux ratios [ i.e. ,  @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ] , these x - ray detected elgs are clearly different from agn - dominated sources .",
    "none of the x - ray detected elgs is detected in the hard band ( 28  kev ) , and their stacked - average x - ray spectral slope of @xmath1 suggests a low fraction of obscured agn activity within the x - ray detected elg population .    the range of rest - frame soft - band luminosities for the 11 @xmath2  0.41.3 x - ray detected",
    "elgs suggests they are probably x - ray detected starburst galaxies similar to m82 and ngc  3256 ( see figure  3 ; e.g. ,  griffiths 2000 ; lira 2002 ) .",
    "the most x - ray luminous sources are up to @xmath3  3 times more luminous than ngc  3256 , the most x - ray luminous nearby starburst galaxy .",
    "the range of @xmath49@xmath50 luminosities ( @xmath51 to @xmath52 depending on the @xmath53-correction used ; e.g. ,  elbaz 2002 ) are also consistent with m82 and ngc  3256-type starbursts .",
    "moran , lehnert , & helfand ( 1999 ) predicted that x - ray detected starbursts would contribute @xmath3  530% of the x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "however , the total soft and hard band fluxes of the x - ray detected starbursts in this study ( @xmath54  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath9 and @xmath55  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath9 , respectively ) only account for @xmath3  2% of the xrb ( assuming the xrb flux densities given in garmire 2002 ) .",
    "this fraction is below the lower limit given by moran ( 1999 ) , although we note that these x - ray observations have probably not fully resolved the xrb ( e.g. ,  cowie 2002 ) and we might expect these sources to dominate the faint x - ray source counts .",
    "the large fraction of x - ray detected elgs with 15  @xmath0 m counterparts suggests an association between the production of x - ray and ir emission .",
    "since the 15  @xmath0 m emission is considered an unobscured indicator of star - formation rate ( e.g. ,  rowan - robinson 1997 ) , this further suggests that the x - ray emission can provide an indication of star - formation rate .",
    "however , we urge caution since the 17 15  @xmath0 m detected elgs undetected at x - ray energies have @xmath19-band magnitude , @xmath56 color , @xmath57 color , 15  @xmath0 m flux density , and redshift distributions indistinguishable from the 11 x - ray detected starbursts ( a kolmogorov - smirnov test gives probabilities of 98% , 97% , 48% , 78% and 55% , respectively ) . and @xmath57 colors were taken from the photometric catalog produced in paper vi . ]",
    "these results suggest a broad range of x - ray luminosities for starbursts of similar ir luminosities and implies that there may be another factor that effects the production of the x - ray emission .",
    "the lack of a statistical difference between the @xmath57 and @xmath56 colors suggest that galaxy type and dust extinction effects are not important .",
    "however , we note that a much larger fraction of the x - ray detected starbursts have radio counterparts ; see bauer ( 2002 ) for further constraints .",
    "the four @xmath58 sources have x - ray luminosities typical of normal galaxies ( i.e. ,  @xmath59  erg  s@xmath9 ; see figure  3 ; hornschemeier 2002 , hereafter paper viii ) .",
    "their average @xmath49@xmath50 luminosity of @xmath60  is also typical of normal galaxies .",
    "these sources arise at smaller x - ray - to - optical flux ratios than the x - ray detected starbursts [ i.e. ,  @xmath61 . thus to detect higher redshift normal galaxies will require either deeper  observations or the application of x - ray stacking techniques ( e.g. ,  paper viii ) .",
    "deeper ir observations ( i.e. ,  goods ) are planned with _ sirtf _ over @xmath3  160  arcmin@xmath13 of the most sensitive region of the cdf - n : these should reach a depth in the 24  @xmath0 m mips band to an equivalent 15  @xmath0 m flux density of @xmath3  10  @xmath0jy .",
    "in addition to providing a sample of @xmath3  100 x - ray detected elgs with 24  @xmath0 m counterparts , these observations should be deep enough to detect counterparts for the majority of the x - ray detected algs and agn - dominated sources .",
