    "nitrogen is the most common impurity found in most natural and synthetic diamonds ( with the possible exception of hydrogen ) , and nitrogen - containing complexes have attracted significant research interest during the past 50  years .",
    "a significant proportion of recent research into diamond has concentrated primarily on the quantum optoelectronic properties of the negatively - charged nitrogen - vacancy ( @xmath5 , a substitutional nitrogen atom nearest - neighbor to a vacant lattice site ) defect and its potential use in quantum metrology and sensing.@xcite @xmath6has been well characterized by optical@xcite and electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr)@xcite techniques : the relative concentrations of @xmath6and @xmath5are determined by the availability of a suitable electron donor ( e.g.  single substitutional nitrogen @xmath7 ) .",
    "@xmath8 belong to the @xmath0 family of defects , where @xmath9 : the defects @xmath10 , @xmath11and @xmath12are identified with the h3 ( zero phonon line ( zpl ) ) , @xcite n3 ( ) @xcite and b - center ( infrared absorption band ) optical bands that have been extensively studied.@xcite a notable void in the understanding of @xmath0-type complexes is the lack of identification of @xmath1(see figure  [ subfig : nvndrawing ] ) : a number of candidate optical and paramagnetic signatures have been postulated,@xcite the most promising of which is the optical h2 band , however no conclusive identification has been made of the defect by epr .",
    "the h2 optical band was first reported in 1956 as a broad absorption feature observed after irradiation and annealing of natural diamond.@xcite at , h2 is observed in both luminescence and absorption with a zpl at and an accompanying vibronic band .",
    "uniaxial stress measurements of the h2 zpl assigned a symmetry of @xmath13,@xcite while photochromism charge balance studies suggest that the defect is the negative charge state of the h3 optical defect.@xcite    the assignment of h2 and h3 to different charge states of the same defect presents a potential problem : the ground state of @xmath1should be epr - active ( with spin @xmath14 ) , but has not been observed.@xcite one candidate epr spectrum has been tentatively attributed to @xmath1 , but the given spin hamiltonian parameters are a poor fit to the limited experimental data.@xcite    the electronic structure of @xmath10/@xmath1(see figure  [ subfig : n2velectronic ] ) precludes any simple spin - polarization mechanisms such as those seen in @xmath5and @xmath15;@xcite however the known one - electron ionization behaviour@xcite from @xmath1(paramagnetic ) to @xmath10(diamagnetic ) makes the @xmath2system a candidate for long - lived nuclear spin memory protocols such as those recently exploited in silicon.@xcite    in this paper , an epr spectrum is identified with @xmath3 in a treated @xmath16-enriched diamond ; @xmath16and @xmath17spin hamiltonian parameters are extracted from the epr spectrum and used to aid identification of @xmath4 in a sample with c & n isotopes in natural abundance .",
    "the spin hamiltonian parameters are discussed and are employed to illustrate the difficulty in identifying the spectrum in natural abundance samples .",
    "isotopic enrichment is a well - established technique in the study of defects in diamond : nitrogen enrichment has been employed for over 30 years;@xcite carbon enrichment for at least 20.@xcite recent reports have concentrated on carbon isotopic enrichment in chemical vapor deposition ( cvd)-grown diamond ; however cvd synthesis becomes problematic with high levels of gas - phase @xmath18 and hence high pressure high temperature ( hpht ) is still preferred when doping with @xmath19 nitrogen in the solid phase .",
    "atmospheric nitrogen adsorbed ( absorbed ) onto ( into ) the growth source and capsule materials is readily incorporated into the synthesized diamond ( @xmath20 \\gtrapprox \\si{100}{\\ppm}$ ] are typical ) if preventative measures are not employed .",
    "such measures include chemical nitrogen traps ( so - called `` getters '' ) added to the growth materials , or outgassing all growth materials pre - synthesis and sealing the growth capsule .",
    "the sample used in this experiment was grown by evacuating and outgassing a sealed hpht synthesis capsule and subsequently backfilling with @xmath16-enriched @xmath21 gas:@xcite @xmath22 of incorporated nitrogen was @xmath16  nominally identical to the source gas .",
    "both @xmath23and a - centers ( @xmath24 ) are effective traps for mobile vacancies .",
    "if @xmath23is the most abundant impurity post - irradiation ( to produce vacancies and interstitials ; we will not concern ourselves here with the interaction of self - interstitials with nitrogen defects nor the charge state of the vacancy , as neither has a bearing on the following discussion ) , then upon annealing to temperatures where the vacancy is mobile ( @xmath25 ) the dominant aggregation mechanisms will be @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; similarly if a - centers are abundant then the dominant process becomes @xmath28 . if both a - centers and @xmath23are present they will both trap mobile vacancies and @xmath23will donate charge to @xmath2 , undergoing the additional process @xmath29 .",
    "nv is stable to approximately ; at this temperature the reaction @xmath30 and of course @xmath29 start to become significant .",
    "@xmath2 is itself only stable to approximately and anneals out with the production of a - centers ( @xmath31 ) , where the vacancy is recycled to promote further nitrogen aggregation / migration.@xcite thus when irradiated type  ib ( @xmath23is the dominant impurity in starting material ) diamond is annealed , only a very narrow window exists where @xmath2 is produced over nv  it is challenging to produce large concentrations of @xmath2 by this route .",
    "however , if the type  ib diamond is subjected to hpht treatment to convert a substantial fraction of @xmath23(but not all ) to a - centers before irradiation and subsequent annealing at , then significant concentrations of @xmath1(and @xmath10 ) can be produced .",
    "the sample used in this study was annealed using the above protocol : it first underwent high temperature ( @xmath32 ) and pressure ( of order ) treatment for to produce nearest - neighbor nitrogen aggregates .",
    "the sample was then electron irradiated with electrons to create vacancies .",

    "an nir - visible absorption spectrum of the sample is given in figure  [ subfig : syn339uvvis ] .",
    "a @xmath13defect such as @xmath2 may be aligned along one of six equivalent orientations , each defined by its principal plane ( see supplemental material for illustrations of different orientations ; all following directions are for the orientation given in figure  [ subfig : nvndrawing ] ) .",
    "we expect the @xmath39-tensor to be anisotropic with principal directions along , and .",
    "when observed in epr with the zeeman field @xmath40 along a direction , the @xmath39-anisotropy splits the orientations into two distinct groups : two orientations with their defining axis perpendicular to @xmath40 ; and four orientations with their axis at .",
    "@xmath1contains two equivalent nitrogen nuclei  in this case both nuclei are @xmath16and therefore possess @xmath41 .",
    "a reasonable assumption is that the @xmath16hyperfine interaction is approximately along the direction connecting each nitrogen to the vacancy , and hence all nitrogen hyperfine interactions are equivalent when @xmath42 .",
    "the expected structure for an epr spectrum recorded with @xmath42 is therefore two sets of lines ( with intensity 2:1 according to the 4:2 orientation ratio ) each split by two equivalent @xmath41 nuclei .",
    "the experimental @xmath42 spectrum given in figure  [ fig : eprspectrumcomparison ] displays the expected structure : two sets of lines with relative intensities 1:2:1 .",
    "similar arguments apply for both @xmath43 and @xmath44 spectra .",
    "these spectra unambiguously identify an @xmath45 defect containing two equivalent @xmath41 nuclei at near abundance , indicating @xmath16 .",

    "in the simple case , the hyperfine interaction can be described as the sum of an isotropic component arising from non - zero spin density at the nucleus ( fermi contact ) , and an anisotropic dipole - dipole component .",
    "typically the sign of the interaction is ambiguous : here , the sign of the @xmath55and thus @xmath16hyperfine was determined using knowledge of the sign of the quadrupole interaction ( section  [ subsec : n14quadrupole ] ) .    the isotropic component @xmath57{+4.02}{\\mega\\hertz}$ ] ( see table  [ tab : spin_hamiltonian_parameters ] )",
    "is small and opposite in sign to that expected for a negative nuclear magnetic moment .",
    "this implies a negative unpaired electron probability density at the nitrogen nucleus , and hence indicates an indirect interaction ( configuration interaction , exchange polarization):@xcite a similar situation was found for the ground state of @xmath5 , where the unpaired electron probability density is localized on three carbon neighbors.@xcite for @xmath1this suggests , as is confirmed by the @xmath17hyperfine interaction ( section  [ subsec : electronwavefunction ] ) , that the unpaired electron probability density is localized on the two carbon neighbors of @xmath1 , polarizing the core states of the nitrogen and , since the nuclear magneton for @xmath16is negative , yielding a positive fermi contact term .",
    "given the near - zero localization of the unpaired electron probability density on the nitrogen , the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction must originate due to an interaction between the nitrogen and the unpaired electron probability density localized in an orbital on another atom .",
    "a crude model was employed to aid interpretation of @xmath16anisotropic hyperfine interaction . in @xmath10",
    ", each nitrogen atom possesses two electrons in its lone pair pointing into the vacancy ( each nitrogen is back - bonded to three carbons ; see figure  [ subfig : nvn_structure ] ) , whereas both carbon atoms neighboring the vacancy possess only one electron in the non - bonded orbital pointing towards the vacancy .",
    "these two orbitals interact to form an extended bonding orbital , which is thus fully occupied in @xmath10 .",
    "it was therefore assumed that the unpaired electron probability density in @xmath1is localized in an antibonding orbital formed between these two carbon atoms .",
    "an axial dipole - dipole interaction matrix of the form @xmath58 was constructed for each of the unpaired electron probability density locations , then each matrix was transformed into the crystal axes and summed to yield a macroscopic interaction matrix ( the form measured in experiment ) . for each nitrogen atom",
    "the interaction was restricted to the plane containing the nitrogen , vacancy and the appropriate next - nearest neighbor carbon .",
    "no geometric relaxation was included in this model , and the unpaired electron probability density was taken to be localized at two points only .",
    "a least - squares fit was performed against the experimental values , with the only free parameters being @xmath59 , the in - plane angle of the interaction and @xmath60 , the strength of the interaction in mhz .",
    "@xmath59 was measured from the direction between the nitrogen and the next - nearest neighbor carbon and gives the direction of the interaction ; @xmath60 indicates the strength of the interaction ( and hence dipole - dipole proximity ) .",
    "a value of @xmath61 would indicate that the unpaired electron probability density is localized on the axis connecting each nitrogen atom to the vacancy , whereas a value of @xmath62 suggests localization on the axis connecting each nitrogen atom to its next - nearest neighbor carbon atom .    [",

    "the resulting macroscopic interaction differs in orientation from experiment by . a simple electron-@xmath16dipolar calculation@xcite yields this value for @xmath60 with a @xmath16to carbon atom separation of approximately .",
    "reassuringly , this distance is only smaller than the next - nearest neighbor separation of in diamond . for a more precise calculation ,",
    "information about shape and amplitude of the electron wavefunction is required in addition to knowledge about the minimum energy geometrical configuration .",
    "the unpaired electron wavefunction @xmath66 may written as a summation over all atoms where the unpaired electron probability density is non - zero : @xmath67 for carbon and nitrogen atoms in diamond , each atomic wavefunction @xmath68 consists of contributions from @xmath69- and @xmath70-type wavefunctions , with @xmath71 using standard tables and methods for hyperfine interpretation,@xcite the measured @xmath17hyperfine values @xmath72 and @xmath73 yield @xmath74 , @xmath75 and an unpaired electron probability density on each nearest - neighbor carbon atom of @xmath76 .",
    "the calculations above are consistent with one another and form a complete picture : the unpaired electron probability density is highly localized on the two carbon atoms , and the nitrogen interaction is weak due to virtually zero local unpaired electron probability density .",
    "approximately of the unpaired electron probability density can be accounted for by the two carbon atoms nearest - neighbor to the vacancy in @xmath1 .",
    "this is very similar to the @xmath5system , where of the electron spin density can be accounted for by the three nearest - neighbor carbons,@xcite with an @xmath77-hybridization ratio of @xmath78 versus here ; these values suggest that the relaxation of the carbons away from the vacancy is similar in both defects .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , @xmath4 has not previously been identified in @xmath55-doped diamond .",
    "however , its identification in @xmath16-doped diamond provides a route to identification in natural abundance samples : by scaling the hyperfine parameters by the ratio of the isotopic nuclear g - value , @xcite the only unknown parameter required to fit a potential @xmath4 spectrum is the quadrupolar interaction with @xmath55 . using an electron localization in the @xmath552@xmath70 orbital of 0% , as observed in experiment , a quadrupolar interaction strength of @xmath79 can be estimated following previous discussions on the magnitude of @xmath55quadrupolar interaction strengths in diamond.@xcite additionally , following other nitrogen- and vacancy - containing defects in diamond",
    ", the quadrupolar interaction can be assumed to be aligned along .    an hpht synthetic sample with natural nitrogen isotope abundance",
    "was prepared using the treatment procedure described in  [ sec : experiment ] ; subsequent measurements recorded the experimental spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : n14comparisons ] .",
    "simultaneous fitting of and spectra yielded a best - fit value of @xmath80 , in close agreement with the estimate based on other @xmath0 defects in diamond .",
    "the characteristic @xmath55hyperfine structure is not immediately apparent due to the large quadrupolar interaction leading to mixing of nuclear spin states ( 81 possible transitions per defect versus 16 per defect for @xmath16 ) , with the effect that the spectrum is `` smeared out '' .",
    "additionally , the epr spectra of @xmath4 and @xmath46significantly overlap ( and hence obscure one another  see figure  [ fig : n14comparisons ] ) but are spectrally separated in @xmath16-doped material ( due to @xmath81 for @xmath55and @xmath16 , respectively ) . a combination of the inherently more complex spectrum and the difficulty of producing high concentrations of @xmath1 without higher concentrations of @xmath23explains why @xmath4 has not been previously identified .",
