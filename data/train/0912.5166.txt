    "@xcite provide a review of concepts for artificial immune systems to protect computer systems .",
    "a reason for this development is the apparent weakness within traditional computer security systems .",
    "security concerns increasingly affect management of computerised systems .",
    "a survey by fbi / csi shows that 34 percent of the respondent organisations spent more than 5 percent of their total it budget on it - security in 2006 @xcite .",
    "one can therefore expect a variety of approaches within this field .",
    "robustness is one of the fundamental characteristics of biological systems @xcite .",
    "kitano @xcite defines robustness as a property that allows a system to maintain its functions against internal and external perturbations .",
    "@xcite similarly phrase that  _ robustness , the ability to maintain performance in the face of perturbations and uncertainty , is a long - recognised key property of living systems _  .",
    "functionality within computer systems often depends on security measures and their robustness .",
    "observed fault tolerance of biological systems is a good reason to seek inspiration from biology when considering security for complex and autonomous network systems @xcite .",
    "complex computer systems typically result from a development driven by empirical work where not anticipated problems are managed on an _ ad hoc _ basis @xcite .",
    "this tends to make computer systems similar to biological systems which are complex and process information self - organised and distributed .",
    "several authors have pointed out system similarities to biology to clarify computer security issues . the well known concept  computer virus  directly refers to similarities between computers and biological systems @xcite .",
    "li and knickerbockera @xcite point out similarities between computer worms and biological pathogens .",
    "they found that successful computer viruses typically share common tactics as found for biological pathogens .",
    "shafi and abbass @xciteand somaya @xcite survey attempts to secure complex computer systems by biologically - inspired adaptive systems and immunology .",
    "ibrahim and maarof @xcite also review biologically inspired approaches to cryptology .",
    "it is common experience form biology that recognition is important for protection .",
    "examples are insect and cell communities .",
    "social communities and higher order animals also exercise protective recognition and individualism .",
    "computer systems may similarly obtain self - defense .",
    "the following simulation examples illustrate generation of gene sets for nodes in an assumed _ ad hoc _ stationary sensor network .",
    "these examples show that the correlation between the gene sets of different nodes for the present approach can stay within a range which is sufficient for the genes to serve as distributed cryptographic material for the network .",
    "the generation and distribution of cryptographic material here take place as a by - product of uncorrelated interaction between couples of nodes .",
    "these contacts make for example mutations to diffuse throughout and renew the gene pool .",
    "the present examples are only meant for communicating ideas about potentials for self - organised locally based protection .",
    "caution must therefore be exercised not to confuse these illustrations with quantitative analysis or design .",
    "assume an _",
    "ad hoc _ sensor network starts to increase from two nodes until a fixed number of nodes ( a stationary sensor network ) .",
    "this  bootstrap ",
    "process can take place via a protected channel ( for example before physical deployment ) .",
    "fast establishment of network may also reduce possibilities for attacks ( reduce vulnerability ) since there may be unlikely that a possible adversary maintains constant monitoring or readiness within the actual area . an option to protect the network initiation is application of initial cryptographic codes .",
    "nodes which join the network during this initial period , form genetic codes by receiving a mix of genetic codes from parents within the network .",
    "random  mutations ",
    "enter this mix of genes .",
    "the present results are form simulations of 100 and 1000 nodes in a network .",
    "the authors made the simulation tool by direct programming in ada 2005 ( gnu ada under linux ) .",
    "each node in the simulations stores a data sequence similar to a gene in a biological organism .",
    "an indexed set of variables @xmath0 represents a gene sequence of a node @xmath1 where @xmath2 . for each @xmath3 ,",
    "the  nucleotide  @xmath4 has values in the range @xmath5 .",
    "two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 can make an offspring @xmath8 via merging their genes so that @xmath9 and @xmath10 with equal probability @xmath11 and a probability @xmath12 for a random mutation @xmath13 with uniform distribution .",
    "a node enters the network via a random selection of two parents to make an offspring as described above .",
    "the population of linked nodes increases from two initial nodes (  parents  ) up to the maximum of 100 nodes ( 1000 nodes for the second simulation ) . a random node exits this population (  dies  ) , when the number of nodes exceeds this number .",
    "it later returns according to the procedure above .",
    "table [ tab : genes1 ] shows an example of gene sequences ( the 70 first parts ) .",
    "+    figure [ fig : corel1 ] shows that for 100 nodes and only 10 possible parents , the genetic diversity is significant larger than 50 percent ( about 700 out of 1000 corresponding gene elements are equal ) .",
    "this is due to  inter - breeding  between ancestors and descendants .",
    "the tendency of an upper tail for the other similar distributions in figure [ fig : corel1 ] has the same explanation .",
    "figure [ fig : corel_1_2 ] shows a comparison between the distribution of equal gene elements in two simulations of populations of respectively 100 and 1000 nodes .     +    any node can be parent in the 100 nodes population whereas only 10 percent of the nodes can be parent in the 1000 node population .",
    "hence the number of parents are equal for these two populations(100 potential parents ) .",
    "figure [ fig : corel_1_2 ] illustrates that the set of parents defines the gene statistics .",
    "however , the extra offspring contribute to make many small variations ( smooth distribution ) .",
    "figure [ fig : correlation_file ] shows the time development of the average number of equal gene elements for the above simulations of 100 and 1000 nodes .",
    "it shows , as expected , that this time development is equivalent for node populations with the same number of possible parents .",
    "figure [ fig : corel_1_2 ] shows the distribution of the number of equal nodes at the end of the simulation .",
    "figure [ fig : correlation_file ] also shows a  memory factor  @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is time .",
    "it indicates the probability for a gene element to survive ( i.e.  to avoid mutation ) after a number of births given by the time parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the following elaboration shows the potential for using correlation between genes to code messages between nodes .",
    "assume a node x transmits a gene ( sub-)sequence to another node y within a network as above .",
    "for each gene element @xmath16 which x transmits , there corresponds a statistically ( positively ) correlated element @xmath17 in y. figure [ fig : corel1 ] indicates this correlation .",
    "each gene element has equal probability in this case .",
    "assume x applies a  code table  mapping gene elements @xmath18 before transmission .",
    "the receiving node y can estimate this mapping which can serve as an encryption key . the mapping @xmath19 may be restricted to be a one - to - one ( disambiguation ) mapping given by a permutation of the set @xmath20 .",
    "note that there are here @xmath21 such possible permutations .",
    "table [ tab : codes ] shows an example of the conditional distribution of the received code given the original code .",
    "the first line of table [ tab : codes ] indicates that the code table ( function ) maps a to d ( @xmath22 . the second line similarly indicates @xmath23 .",
    "the three bottom lines indicate @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath27 denote any two nodes .",
    "note that for @xmath28 any two different gene elements , @xmath4 and @xmath29 are statistically uncorrelated .",
    "assume that the mapping defines a permutation of the set of integers @xmath30 .",
    "i.e.  @xmath31 is a permutation of @xmath32 .",
    "assume the node @xmath1 transmits the gene elements @xmath33 , @xmath3 to the node @xmath27 after translating then through the code table ( mapping ) @xmath19 as described above .",
    "assume @xmath1 also permutes the order of elements before transmitting it to node @xmath27 translated by a code table ( or function ) @xmath19 .",
    "i.e.  @xmath27 receives the gene codes @xmath34 , @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath27 holds the potential to recognise both the permutation @xmath35 and the code table @xmath19 due to its genetic relation ( code sequence correlation ) with @xmath1 .",
    "the following outline shows this potential .",
    "consider table [ tab : codes ] .",
    "each row represents an estimate @xmath36 of the conditional probability distribution of a translated gene element @xmath37 in the node @xmath27 given the corresponding element @xmath38 in the node @xmath1(note : @xmath39 ) .",
    "let @xmath36 represent the element given by the row @xmath40 and column @xmath41 of table [ tab : codes ] .",
    "the permutation @xmath35 tend to minimise the entropy measure @xmath42 : @xmath43 it similarly maximises the mutual information : @xmath44    hence , @xmath27 may sort out likely candidates for the original permutation @xmath35 decided by the node @xmath1 .",
    "application of equations [ eq : entropy1 ] and [ eq : mutual_information1 ] can significantly save computational cost .",
    "the unconditional distribution of the value of a gene element @xmath4 is for example constant @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of possible values of a gene element ( @xmath47 for the present example ) .",
    "table [ tab : codes ] demonstrates a possible computational simplification .",
    "the actual permutation @xmath35 is the one that gives ( only ) one value significant larger than the others along each row .",
    "the resulting  minimum entropy table  then gives the code table @xmath19 .",
    "restriction of possible permutations and code tables also reduces potential computational cost .",
    "however , it increases the leakage of information to the environment .",
    "hash values from the node @xmath1 may help @xmath27 finally to find the actual permutation among a limited number of likely candidates .",
    "assume two nodes x and y share some ancestors ( are relatives ) and that corresponding gene elements are equal with probability @xmath48 as compared to a not relative where the probability of equal gene element would be @xmath49 ( note that a gene element can have 26 possible values ) .",
    "assume x asks y to guess the value of a number of its ( x s ) gene elements ( for example the @xmath50 first gene elements of x ) .",
    "one may look at this situation as if y has to guess a password ( or a set of possible passwords ) .",
    "x may recognise y as  relative  if it is clever to guess requested passwords ( either measured by response time or by ratio of success assuming x gives y several fake alternative hash values for the passwords so a non - relative will more often guess wrong password as compared to a relative ) .",
    "one may intuitively believe that a probability of @xmath48 to guess correctly each character in a password , does not help much to guess a password of many characters .",
    "the examples below may help perception .",
    "assume , for simplicity , that passwords are only two characters long .",
    "this gives a search space consisting of @xmath51 possible combinations of characters in the range a , b, ",
    ",z ( 26 possible letters ) .",
    "assume the two first gene elements of y are aa ( i.e.  @xmath52 ) .",
    "this means that @xmath53 and @xmath54 for any value of @xmath55 different from a.    table [ tab : password_probabilities1 ] shows that y may utilise information in its genes to significantly restrict the search space for the correct password to find it with probability larger than 50 percent .",
    "the whole search space consists of 676 elements ( possible combinations ) .",
    "hence an outsider ( non relative ) has to search through 338 combinations to find the combinations with 50 percent probability .",
    "however , y may restrict its search to the 51 combinations with highest probability ( row and column a ) .",
    "denote such a search space as a  50 percent probability search space  .",
    "a significant intuition here is that the cardinality of the 50 percent conditional probability search space scales with dimensions below the similar space for unconditional probabilities ( or less restricted conditions ) .",
    "an identification procedure may include several such tests and an outsider may loose the game of guessing passwords by processing too slow or via giving wrong answer too frequent ( provided he is given several alternative hash values for the search ) .",
    "the following example generalises the one above .",
    "assume now that x asks y to guess the value of 10 of its ( x s ) gene elements ( for example the 10 first gene elements of x ) .",
    "the node x may deliver to y a hash value of these gene elements so y can check if it guesses it correct ( or alternatively give a set of possible hash values so y may risk to give wrong answer ) . the sequence of these 10 gene elements forms a key ( or  password  ) which y is asked to resolve (  crack  ) .",
    "the task of y is similar to crack a realistic password given a ( unix ) password file .",
    "node y can reply to node x with another hash value .    the knowledge that @xmath48 gives the node y also here the opportunity to define a probability measure on the set of all possible keys ( or  passwords  ) .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the number of equal gene elements in the corresponding sequence of gene elements of the nodes x and y ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "@xmath56 has the following ( binomial ) probability mass distribution : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the probability of pair - wise equal gene element .",
    "figure [ fig : binomial1 ] shows the distribution of number of pair - wise equal elements for @xmath61",
    ".    note that in the case of @xmath49 ( not relatives ) the probability @xmath62 for any random combination @xmath63 of gene elements is @xmath64 this means ( as expected ) that all combinations have the same probability for being the correct key (  password  ) for not related nodes .",
    "hence , for @xmath49 , in order to find the correct key with more than 50 percent probability , y must test @xmath65 combinations of gene element values .",
    "figure [ fig : binomial1 ] shows that for @xmath48 ( relative ) , more than half of the probability mass is for @xmath66 .",
    "equation [ eq : brute_force1 ] gives the general formula for the total number of combinations @xmath67 for a given number @xmath56 of matching elements .",
    "@xmath69 is number of possible values for each gene element ( in this case @xmath70 ) .",
    "this gives that the total number of tests ( for @xmath66 and @xmath49 ) is @xmath71 .",
    "hence a non - relative has to process ( test ) in average about 1000 times more different keys ( combinations ) as compared to a relative to find the correct key with a probability larger than 50 percent .",
    "this difference ( ratio ) increases with increased value of @xmath60 ( for relative ) , increased number of possible gene elements and increased key length .",
    "the ratio is for example more than a million for @xmath72(and @xmath59 and @xmath48 as above ) .",
    "the present approach can be redundant and complementary to centrally organised trusted components such as for public key infrastructure @xcite .",
    "centrally organised and designed security systems typically lack robustness , distributability and autonomy .",
    "they require correct implementation and management @xcite .",
    "hence one seeks alternatives for systems to operate in hostile or uncontrolled environments of for example users not caring for security .",
    "section [ se : example ] illustrates by examples the potential to improve security in sensor networks where the nodes possess interrelated individual ",
    "codes with a restricted lifetime .",
    "these examples are only meant to communicate ideas and to show potentials for control / regulation of statistical correlation between gene codes .",
    "the nodes in these examples carry a dynamic ( time changing )  gene pool  which can be looked at as a distributed common secret for recognition and protection of communication .",
    "this method of  genetic protection  has similarities to application of threshold cryptography where nodes share a cryptographic secret without each storing the entire information of it @xcite .",
    "the present simulation examples show protection without direct adaptation to specific adversaries (  patogens  ) .",
    "the protection method is in this way similar to innate ( static ) immune systems .",
    "however , assume an adversary manage to obtain genetic information from the gene pool and to use it for intrusion .",
    "if it fails to fit into the phylogenetic three of the gene pool , or it appears as a clone of a member of the network , then the network may regenerate the part of the gene pool which makes the intruder able to enter the network .",
    "this gives adaptation to specific intruders ( cf the concept of  adaptive immune systems  ) .",
    "genetic protection also has similarities to application of chaos cryptography @xcite where nodes obtain common secrets via a synchronisation process and which they can use to protect communication .",
    "a node must participate in the synchronisation to obtain the common secret ( encryption key ) which is time varying .",
    "a significant difference here ( from the present approach ) is that application of chaos synchronisation requires frequent communication / updates .",
    "note that both chaos cryptography and numerically based cryptography @xcite over public channels imply active participation in a communication for a node to obtain cryptographic material .",
    "the examples above are similar in this way .",
    "a node which is passive long enough , will fall outside the communication .",
    "the present ideas have the justification from potential advantages in given situations .",
    "these situations can be defined by for example low communication bandwidth , periods with unidirectional communication and attacks on centralised security systems .",
    "risk for loss of data is often a special issue for sensor networks .",
    "nodes in sensor networks may store valuable data and redundant security systems may help to secure these before a possibly expendable sensor system halts .",
    "sensor systems typically collect data which are available in the environment .",
    "hence protection of these data from being available for outsiders may have little meaning .",
    "protection of functionality may therefore be a main focus for security within sensor networks .",
