    "one of the primary tools to understanding the history of the solar neighborhood , and more generally the milky way , is the chemical composition of stars . from the initial efforts of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , to the more recent works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , compilations of stellar abundances",
    "provide an overall picture of the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood .",
    "notable results obtained over the past few decades include correlations of metallicity with age and galactocentric distance , and whether the sun is suitably `` average '' @xcite .",
    "trends in the elemental abundances , and a limited number of isotopic abundances , relative to iron have also been observed over the whole metallicity range of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "for example , oxygen and the other @xmath0-chain elements , relative to iron , vary systematically from being overabundant at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.0 dex to roughly solar at [ fe / h ] @xmath2 0.0 .",
    "this decrease is widely taken to be caused by the contributions of supernovae type ia ( sn ia ) in an average , well - mixed interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "another tool to interpret the history of the solar neighborhood ( taken throughout this paper to be stars within 150 pc of the sun ) is the theory of stellar evolution , nucleosynthesis , and chemical evolution . by quantifying the ejecta from stars",
    ", this history can be reconstructed using theoretical models @xcite .",
    "these models account for the initial mass function , star formation rate , stellar yields , inherited composition from the local interstellar medium ( ism ) , and are one of the keys to quantifying the formation of local solar neighborhood stars .",
    "their results help provide important constraints on chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood , the galactic disk , and other galaxies .    as the number of spectroscopic surveys of stars in the solar neighborhood increases , it has become tradition for authors of abundance surveys or chemical evolution models to compare their relative abundances to benchmark data sets for verification or validation .",
    "typically , this involves comparing to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "however , the manner by which these comparisons are conducted varies drastically .",
    "some authors provide statistical evaluations such as mean differences and standard deviations , some compare a few `` typical '' stars , and others graphically juxtapose entire catalogs . while there are certainly correlations between published data sets , there has been little discussion of the nuances , random uncertainties , and systematic biases of the compared data sets .",
    "it is , however , these idiosyncrasies that make interpreting trends between abundance catalogs challenging .",
    "it is difficult and rare for one survey to systematically observe a large number of nearby stars and provide abundance determinations for a wide variety of elements .",
    "for example , @xcite reported the relative abundance in 1040 stars for only five elements , including iron .",
    "alternatively , @xcite analyzed spectra for 27 elements , but their study had only 181 stars . to achieve the most complete coverage of the solar neighborhood , the relative abundances from known literature sources must be combined .",
    "such compilations have been undertaken by , for example , @xcite and @xcite , with the amalgamation of thirteen and eleven published catalogs , respectively .",
    "@xcite contrasted the elemental abundance trends found in the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the overall trends found in the milky way in order to investigate whether , for example , the milky way halo could have been built from such systems . in a vein similar to our own , @xcite analyzed the abundance trends between @xmath3 [ fe / h ] @xmath4 for thin and thick disk stars . in both cases",
    ", the authors compiled detailed element abundances for a large number of stars in order to better understand overarching trends within the milky way .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to present our _ hypatia catalog _  so named after one of the first female astronomers who lived around 400 a.d .. the _ hypatia catalog _ ( hereafter , hypatia ) is an unbiased compilation of spectroscopic abundance determinations from 84 literature sources for 50 elements across 3058 stars within 150 pc of the sun . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we show that the stellar abundances within hypatia reflect the zeroth order trends consistent with published literature and mean galactic chemical evolution models . in ",
    "[ s.comp ] , we discuss the collation of the data , the inherent challenges in combining different data sources . in  [ s.analysis ] we discuss the analysis of the stars in the hypatia , whether they are thin- or thick - disk stars , and our attempts to mitigate some of the challenges in compiling such a large dataset . these adjustments to the data were only for the purposes of analysis and are not reflected in the published catalog . in  [ s.struct ] , we describe more thoroughly how hypatia was compiled . in ",
    "[ s.cat ] , we describe some of the details of the _ hypatia catalog _ as well as the abundance trends seen in fe . in  [ s.alpha ] , we present the abundance trends found in the @xmath0-elements @xmath5 c , o , mg , si , s , ca & ti @xmath5 in the solar neighborhood . in",
    " [ s.odd ] , we describe the abundance trends for the odd - z elements , namely li , n , na , al , p , k & sc . the trends found in the iron - peak elements ( v , cr , mn , co & ni ) are discussed in  [ s.ironpeak ] while those elements that are beyond the iron - peak ( cu , zn , sr , y , zr , & mo ) are given in  [ s.beyond ] .",
    "finally , the neutron - capture elements ( ru , ba , la , ce , pr , nd , sm , eu , gd , dy , & pb ) and their abundances are presented in  [ s.neutron ] .",
    "finally , in  [ gaps ] , we analyze an anomaly in the abundance measurements of a number of different elements that presented  gaps \" in [ x / fe ] with for all [ fe / h ] and discuss the physical implications .",
    "in this section we detail the scope of hypatia and the manner in which datasets were chosen to be included .",
    "we also go into a more critical analysis of the individual works from which the abundance data were determined , given in a tabular format in table [ tab.long ] .",
    "numerous studies have analyzed the photospheres of stars in the solar neighborhood using photometric and spectroscopic techniques .",
    "photometric investigations have treated a much larger number of stars relative to spectroscopic methods .",
    "however , photometric studies generally yield one global metallicity parameter , [ fe / h ] @xmath6 , with units in dex , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the number of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit volume , respectively . despite the smaller number of stars analyzed with spectroscopy , the additional element abundances allow assessment of not just the overall metallicity , but the full chemical compositional range and evolution .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to focus on published spectroscopic abundance catalogs .",
    "we compiled hypatia with the spectroscopic abundance determinations of 50 element abundances for 3058 unique stars from published catalogs .",
    "our exhaustive literature search considered all abundance determinations , of which we are aware , for main sequence f / g / k / m - type stars within 150 pc of the sun .",
    "table [ tab.hyp ] shows a sample of the _ hypatia catalog _ which includes stellar hip / hd / bd names , spectral type , distance , position , and the compiled abundances as given by each catalog , with reference .",
    "the complete catalog is given in the electronic version of this paper and the reduced catalog ( per the discussion in  [ s.analysis ] and  s.cat ) will be made available on vizier .",
    "efforts were made to include literature sources with abundance measurements for local stars published before the original submission of this ( and any following ) paper ; any exclusion was not intentional .",
    "in addition , hypatia has and will continue to be updated as newer and more precise abundances are determined . while these updates will be announced in subsequent papers , hypatia will also be made available as an independent online database such that the community will have access to the most up - to - date data .",
    "therefore , if a star within the solar neighborhood was measured for abundances other than iron , and it is 150 pc of the sun , it will be incorporated into hypatia .",
    "the data sets that are contained in hypatia are listed in table [ tab.cat ] , along with the number of stars meeting the above criteria and the element abundances determined therein . throughout the paper ,",
    "we give a more detailed description of each literature source and their method for determining stellar abundances .",
    "a histogram of the number of stars measured for each element in hypatia is shown in fig.[fig.hist ] .",
    "all 3058 stars have a spectroscopically determined [ fe / h ] .",
    "the next most frequently measured elements in hypatia are si ( 2320 stars ) , ti ( 2237 stars ) , ni ( 2225 stars ) , and o ( 2125 stars ) .",
    "there are only 33 stars in the solar neighborhood for which [ ru / h ] has been measured and only 20 stars for [ p / h ] .",
    "fig.[fig.hist ] also shows the relative paucity of stars in the solar neighborhood that have had their nitrogen , magnesium , and sulfur abundances determined , showing a clear direction for future studies of under - explored elements .",
    "this is primarily due to having too few absorption lines , or lines that are too weak to separate from the continuum in the optical spectrum . the _ hypatia catalog _ also has abundance measurements for 13 singly ionized elemental species . while some catalogs measured only one ionization state when reporting an abundance determination , a number of catalogs combined the abundances from multiple ionization states . in hypatia , an abundance of [ x / fe ] means that a catalog measured the neutral state , a combination of neutral and ionized state(s ) , or it was not specified",
    "whenever a catalog specifically mentioned it was only measuring the singly ionized state , we write [ x ii / fe ] .",
    "it was a large endeavor to compile and merge the 84 datasets in hypatia , using services such as vizier , ads , and simbad as well as often times going to the original source in order to transcribe tables not available online .",
    "however , we recognize that it is naive to collect data without critically analyzing the individual works .",
    "tab.long ] presents a comprehensive inventory of the datasets with 20 or more stars found in hypatia , including the telescopes and spectrographs , resolution , signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , and wavelength range .",
    "we also documented the methods used by the individual authors to determine the stellar abundances , such as the stellar atmosphere models , equivalent width measurement techniques , whether they used iterative force - fits of observed and synthesized equivalent widths ( i.e. curve - of - growth ) or spectral fitting procedures , the solar abundances employed , and the number of fe i and fe ii lines .",
    "data were compiled with as much information as provided by the authors in their papers or subsequent references .",
    "care was also taken to cite the appropriate sources , when available .",
    "any error or exclusion was not intentional .    looking at the catalogs given in table [ tab.long ] , it is clear that a wide variety of telescopes and spectrographs have been employed in order to determine stellar abundances in the local neighborhood .",
    "the telescope mirror sizes have a range from 1 m at the cerro tololo inter - american telescope ( ctio , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the 10 m telescope at keck using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the average aperture size is 3.4 m for all of the telescopes listed in table [ tab.long ] .",
    "a total of 18 of the 58 datasets combine spectra from two or more telescopes when determining their abundances .",
    "the resolution from the instruments varies from @xmath9 @xmath2 30000 @xcite to 120000 @xcite , where @xcite cite a range in @xmath9 @xmath2 60000 in their spectra alone , which was combined from multiple telescopes / spectrographs .",
    "signal - to - noise was in general 100200 per spectral pixel , where the largest span ( 901350 per pixel ) was encompassed by the spectra amalgamation in @xcite .",
    "the methods employed in order to determine the abundances from the spectra were also rather diverse . the preferred programs for determining stellar atmospheres were marcs per @xcite and atlas by @xcite .",
    "however , a number of alternative routines were also employed , such as eaglnt @xcite and mafags @xcite . of the 58 datasets in table [ tab.long ]",
    ", a total of 48 of them determined equivalent widths of the absorption lines , for example using iraf splot , ares , or width9 @xcite , and then used the curve - of - growth method , per moog @xcite or uppsala eqwidth , to calculate the majority of element abundances .",
    "conversely , there were 10 datasets who used spectral fitting as their predominant method of determining stellar abundances .",
    "many of the datasets in the _ hypatia catalog _ used @xcite and @xcite for their solar abundance scale , however , many also calculated their own .",
    "as discussed in ",
    "[ s.spread ] , we have divided out the solar abundance used in each individual dataset and instead applied the abundance scale by @xcite .    finally ,",
    "while most of the catalogs that are incorporated into hypatia published their line lists , not all of them measured the same element abundances , making a standardized comparison difficult .",
    "however , as mentioned in  [ s.comp ] , it was a requirement that any dataset added into hypatia have [ fe / h ] abundance measurements .",
    "therefore , we have included the number of fe i and fe ii lines in the last column of table [ tab.long ] . through work as a part of the stellar stoichiometry : workshop without walls held at arizona state university during april 2013 ( hinkel et al . in prep ) , it was confirmed that the number of iron lines measured , below a certain threshold , drastically affects the determined [ fe / h ] abundance regardless of the abundance measurement technique employed .",
    "this is of particular interest given that the number of fe i / fe ii lines varies from 20 / 1 @xcite to 450 / 25 @xcite  ignoring those catalogs for which a definite count could not be made , namely @xcite and @xcite .    from table [ tab.long ]",
    "we have found that a number of datasets included in the _ hypatia catalog _ use different telescopes / spectrographs at varying resolutions with a range in s / n , along with an assortment of prescriptions for modeling the stellar atmospheres and methods for measuring a variety of absorption lines in the spectra to determine abundances .",
    "however , we opted to avoid any sort of hierarchy on which to place the datasets , for fear that our  choices \" may be inadvertently arbitrary or without the scientific rigor demonstrated in @xcite . we also found that scaling the abundances based on their stellar parameters was not viable per @xcite .",
    "instead , we examine the uniformity of the elemental abundances on a star - by - star basis between the datasets in  [ s.spread ] and exclude inconsistent measurements based on standard error in our further analysis .",
    "here we examine more closely the stars within the _ hypatia catalog _ , for example whether they are likely to be from the thin or thick disk population of the galaxy .",
    "we also study the discrepancy in abundances when multiple datasets measure the same element within the same star . as a result of the following analysis",
    ", we are able to define a subset of abundances within the _ hypatia catalog _ that is both homogenous and robust .      we separated the stars in the _ hypatia catalog _ into the galactic components , for example thin - disk , thick - disk , or halo stars , based on their kinematics .",
    "since chemical differences between the stellar populations are still debated , and chemical trends are the topic of our investigation , we decided that a conservative kinematic approach was the most appropriate .",
    "we used the updated and extended @xmath10 space velocities as determined for the _ hipparcos catalog _ by @xcite .",
    "the local standard of rest used in their calculations was @xmath11 kms@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we followed the prescription in @xcite in order to determine the probability that the hypatia stars belonged to one of the galactic components . by assuming the space velocities of the three stellar populations , as well as the number densities of the stellar components in the solar neighborhood",
    ", we were able to get a probability that a star belonged to a certain population .",
    "we assumed that 18% of the stars in the solar neighborhood originated in the thick disk , per @xcite . this local relative stellar density does not agree with ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) who assumed a 6% thick - disk population .",
    "however , it is lower than the 25% adopted in @xcite who later estimated an expected range of 2 - 15% with a larger sample size , similar to that found in @xcite , and larger than that noted in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we found 18% to be a good median that was more conservative and agreed with the more recent studies .",
    "we did adopt the gaussian distributions used in @xcite .    according to our probabilities ,",
    "2537 stars in hypatia are thin - disk stars , 369 are thick - disk stars , 0 were from the halo , and 163 did not have space velocities according to @xcite .",
    "therefore , we find that 12% of the _ hypatia catalog _ stars are likely from the thick - disk , as illustrated in red in the toomre diagram ( a. toomre 1980 private communication with * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in fig .",
    "[ uvw ] ( left ) .",
    "our local stellar density calculations are consistent with the literature and lie within the expected range estimated by @xcite .",
    "* we did not include any of the probable thick - disk stars in our chemical abundance analysis in ",
    "[ s.cat ]   [ s.neutron ] . *",
    "a number of people have noted , for example @xcite , and references therein , that the galactic components of the solar neighborhood may be discerned via a combination of both kinematics and chemical abundances . in their paper , @xcite described a population distinction occurring in an [ @xmath0/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] diagram , where  @xmath0 \" refers to the average of the mg , si , and ti abundances .",
    "more pointedly , a region devoid of abundances measurements should occur approximately at [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath2 0.2 - 0.3 dex , with a possible  knee \" at [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -0.3 dex ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) . we have recreated the @xcite figure in fig .",
    "[ uvw ] ( right ) where the thin - disk stars are light yellow circles and the thick - disk stars are red triangles .",
    "the two populations in the _ hypatia catalog _ appear relatively well - mixed with respect to [ @xmath0/fe ] , with few thick - disk stars that have lower [ @xmath0/fe ] and higher [ fe / h ] .",
    "our findings mimic the trends seen in @xcite , who also analyze the trends seen in [ @xmath0/fe ] compared to [ fe / h ] for thin- and thick - disk stars .",
    "they also do not show the same  knee \" or empty region displayed in @xcite .",
    "/fe ] , which was not seen using the hypatia stars.,height=288 ]      collecting abundance determinations from multiple authors over about a 25 year time span means at least the following differences between data sets : instrument zero points , resolution of the spectra , signal - to - noise ratios , oscillator strengths , line lists , equivalent widths , number of ionization stages used , lte or non - lte analysis , converged solar atmosphere models , curve - of - growth or spectral fitting , curve - of - growth program used , and adopted solar abundances .",
    "all of these factors may introduce systematic and stochastic differences between data sets .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ spread ] ( top ) shows the abundance measurements for six elements within five hypatia stars .",
    "the circles are as labeled with the element name while all triangles designate [ fe / h ] , each with respective error bars from the catalog from which it was measured .",
    "the variation between catalogs per element , the largest of which we call the _ spread _ , has a mean of 0.14 dex and a median of 0.11 dex for all elements in all stars in hypatia .",
    "these values are on par if not larger than the error bars for most elements .",
    "in addition to the abundances , stellar parameters may also suffer from inherent issues , depending on the reduction procedure .",
    "@xcite analyzed three methods for determining t@xmath13 , @xmath14(g ) , and [ fe / h ] in order to find the systematic differences between the techniques .",
    "they utilized both  constrained \" spectroscopic determinations of the stellar parameters , by making use of the normalized semimajor axis @xmath15 , as well as  unconstrained \" determinations . through these comparisons , they found that in the case of stellar parameter classification ( spc ) and spectroscopy made easy ( sme ) , both of which employ spectral synthesis and global @xmath16 minimization , the surface gravity was strongly correlated to the t@xmath13 and [ fe / h ] measurements ( see their figures 2 and 4 ) . in other words ,",
    "when the @xmath14(g ) values are larger , the t@xmath13 and [ fe / h ] measurements increase due to the degeneracy between the stellar parameters . additionally , they noted that the variation for each respective parameter between the  constrained \" and  unconstrained \" determinations increased as effective temperature increased ( their figure 6 ) . within the _ hypatia catalog _",
    "[ spread ] shows the variation of t@xmath13 and @xmath14(g ) ( middle and bottom , respectively ) among many of the included datasets , determined for the abundances given at the top of the figure ( when reported ) . for t@xmath13 , there is a spread of @xmath17200 k , while @xmath14(g ) can differs by a factor of @xmath17 0.3 .",
    "the overall abundance determinations are sensitive to the adopted stellar values , especially @xmath14(g ) .     for a given star are denoted by circles and the corresponding [ fe / h ] abundances",
    "are shown as triangles . in the middle , the t@xmath13 values for the same stars and @xmath14(g ) are at the bottom .",
    ", height=576 ]    there is an accumulation of systematic and stochastic differences in the abundance measurements compiled to form hypatia .",
    "other authors have noted the difficulties in comparing different catalogs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but only recently have they tried to overcome the challenges .",
    "@xcite analyzed the lithium abundances from nearby stars , supplemented by abundances from 7 other catalogs .",
    "they attempted to scale the abundances within the catalogs by taking into account the differing stellar parameters ( namely , t@xmath13 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , the abundances did not vary with the stellar parameters in a consistent manner , not linearly or even as a standard function .",
    "because stellar atmospheric models determine a wide variety of parameters , we agree with @xcite that attempting to correct for differing stellar parameters between catalogs will not be scientifically valuable .",
    "therefore , we have decided to use a method similar to @xcite .",
    "he combined 54 nearby stellar abundance catalogs and only used the highest quality abundances for repeat observations , making no attempt to correct for differing stellar parameters .",
    "his data was therefore unbiased towards one specific dataset , unlike @xcite who opted to normalize the other datasets to their own .",
    "due to the range of possible issues , we have not included t@xmath13 and @xmath14(g ) for the stars in hypatia .",
    "we attempted to make the various catalogs in hypatia more copacetic by putting all the different measurements on the same solar abundance scale , a correction that was also employed in @xcite , see table [ tab.long ] , column 9 .",
    "while some literature sources adjust their atomic data in order for their results to match certain solar values , this correction takes place before the stellar - to - solar comparison and therefore before the solar normalization , or re - normalization .",
    "therefore , normalization to the same solar scale is the only correction available to us that helps make the data more comparable and does not involve recalculating the abundance determinations from every dataset . for example , per table [ tab.hyp ] , @xcite reported hip 400 to have [ ti / h ] = -0.28 dex . in their paper , they cite @xcite as the source of their solar abundances , where @xmath19 = 4.99 . to calculate the re - normalized abundances according to the solar measurements by @xcite , where @xmath19 = 4.93 , then [ ti / h ] @xmath20 dex .",
    "for all of the abundances within each star in the _ hypatia catalog _ , we found that the average difference between the abundance determination before and after the re - normalization was 0.06 dex , with a median of 0.04 dex .",
    "these variations in abundance are larger than the quoted error for many of the elements determined by the literature datasets . on the other hand , the average and median spread found in hypatia only changed by 0.01 dex as a result of the re - normalization . in other words ,",
    "the choice of solar abundance scale significantly affects the element abundance measurement , however , re - normalizing all of the datasets to the same solar abundance scale does not reduce the spread in the data . to be as consistent as possible , for all hypatia calculations hereafter , we retain the element abundance values using the @xcite solar abundance renormalization .",
    "the _ hypatia catalog _ was compiled using python 2.7.3 with the following packages : matplotlib 1.3.1 , numpy 1.8.0 , and atpy 0.9.6 .",
    "abundances tables ( that measured both [ fe / h ] and at least one other element [ x / fe ] ) were either downloaded from vizier , converted to machine - readable formats from the latexmanuscripts supported by ads , or were manually transcribed . the stellar names used in each individual table",
    "were then matched to the hipparcos naming - scheme , which was chosen in order to provide continuity , incorporate as many stars as possible in the solar neighborhood , and provide a variety of stellar parameters ( see table [ tab.hyp ] ) .",
    "datasets were only included in hypatia if at least one star was within 150 pc of the sun with a f , g , k , or m spectral type .",
    "in addition , we did not include abundances in our analysis that were determined using non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) approximations .",
    "if a dataset had stars that met the above criteria , than the element names , abundance values , and the literature source are recorded for each star , which is then incorporated into hypatia . however , if a star within the dataset was found to likely originate from the thick disk or halo ( per our discussion in  [ s.thinthick ] ) , that star was not incorporated in the compilation .",
    "meaning , while a dataset may have been included , all of their stars are not necessarily part of the hypatia catalog . during this process",
    ", we also renormalized all of the stellar abundances , using @xcite as the standard .",
    "once the renormalized abundances from all 84 datasets are compiled into hypatia , then we are able to analyze the data . an element is first chosen to study , for example , sodium .",
    "every thin disk star with a sodium abundance measurement is determined . in the cases where multiple datasets measured the same element abundance in the same star , so as not to favor any catalog like @xcite , the median value for those measurements is used .",
    "however , we found that if the discrepancy between catalog measurements is too large , the median abundance value was unreliable .",
    "rather than preferentially choose one catalog over another , we opted to eliminate those stars that do not have consistently measured element abundances from our analysis , in lieu of those that are more uniform and of higher quality .",
    "therefore , * any star with a spread in either [ x / h ] or [ fe / h ] larger than the respective error bar was not included in the following ( plotting ) analysis .",
    "this cutoff value was used because it highlights those elements that are not well agreed upon by multiple literature sources . * the total number of well - understood element abundances that remain for thin disk stars ( see  [ s.thinthick ] ) with spread per element less than error bar are listed in table [ tab.skip ] . reduced abundances for these stars will be made available on vizier .    in order to determine the representative error associated with each of the elements , we recorded the error as reported by each of the datasets from which that element was measured and averaged them together .",
    "very few surveys determined star - by - star error values for the abundances , forcing us to also use a more general error bar per elements . in those cases where there were abundance errors per star , we took the average of all of the individual errors .",
    "while this method may mask some of the more precise abundance measurements with smaller associated errors , we found that it was better to take the more conservative approach by over - estimating the error , rather than under - estimating .",
    "going back to the example , for the case of sodium , there are 907 thin disk stars with one sodium abundance each that either came from 1 ) a single dataset or 2 ) the median value of multiple datasets measurements that have small variation between them .",
    "because every star and every element abundance measurement are not created equal , this means that we are not plotting the same stars for every element . instead , each element within each star is analyzed on a case - by - case basis in order to ensure that the quality of the data is high for our analysis , such that there were no compilation errors or idiosyncrasies . to create the [ x / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] plots prevalent in  [ s.alpha]-[s.neutron ]",
    ", we binned each of the stars according to distance from the sun , as calculated from the ra , dec , and parallax angles associated with the updated hipparcos catalog @xcite .",
    "quantifying systematic errors that could result from instrumental , atomic database , or stellar atmosphere models is beyond the scope of this paper , but we encourage the community to undertake such verification and validation studies .",
    "therefore , we have decided to publish the _ hypatia catalog _ , see table [ tab.hyp ] , containing only the original data by the literature authors , without any of our alteration or combination .",
    "in this way , others may use the compiled data to perform a more selective analysis as they see fit .",
    "combining 84 data sets that span about 25 years means there will be a _ spread _ among reported values for any element in many stars .",
    "we have have taken a many steps to address the issues to help make results generated with hypatia meaningful and physical .",
    "we ( a ) exclude any probable thick - disk stars per the @xcite method , illustrated in the toomre diagram ( fig .",

    "we also analyze the data for trends in radial distance , z - height above the galactic disk , and directionality per the galactic center and anti - center .",
