    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and radio millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are thought to be , respectively , the starting and the ending stages of a common evolutionary path , where a neutron star accretes matter ( and angular momentum ) from a companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the early phases of this evolutionary path are characterized by active mass accretion accompanied by intense x - ray emission ( larger than @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ) .",
    "these systems are observed as lmxbs characterized by a few outburst in the x - ray due to accretion disk instabilities .",
    "these objects are usually called `` x - ray transients '' @xcite .",
    "when the neutron star is re - accelerated , the system will appear as a msp in the radio band .",
    "newly born msps are therefore expected to have a bloated and tidally deformed companion which is still losing mass from its roche lobe . in this case , the system is called `` redback '' ( or `` black widow '' if the companion is less massive than @xmath3 ) . following the canonical scenario , at the end of the evolution only the degenerate core of the peeled companion ( i.e. , a helium or carbon - oxygen white dwarf ) is predicted to orbit the msp ( a sub - stellar mass object , which is eventually completely evaporated , in the case of a black widow ) .",
    "indeed , the optical searches for the companion stars to binary msps performed so far in galactic globular clusters detected objects belonging to all these three classes : five bloated stars , companions to redbacks ( see @xcite ) , two very low mass objects companions to black widows ( @xcite , cadelano et al .",
    "2015 , submitted to apj ) , and eight white dwarfs companions to canonical msps ( @xcite , mario cadelano et al . in preparation ,",
    "liliana rivera sandoval et al . in preparation ) .",
    "a new unexpected link has been added to the chain very recently .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray transient igr j18245 - 2452 in the globular cluster m28 @xcite corresponds to msp m28i , and the system is currently swinging between accretion - powered and rotation - powered states .",
    "this shows that the transition from a lmxb to a msp passes through an intermediate phase during which the two states cyclically alternate over a time scale of a few years @xcite . a low - mass main sequence star , which experienced a strong ( @xmath4 magnitudes )",
    "luminosity increase , has been identified as the optical counterpart to the system @xcite .    on march 13 , 2015 , swift / bat observations detected an x - ray burst in terzan 5 @xcite .",
    "the swift / xrt observations promptly following the swift / bat detection localized the transient source at ra(j2000)@xmath5 , dec(j2000)@xmath6 , with a 90% uncertainty of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the measured spectrum turned out to be consistent with a relatively hard photon index of @xmath8 and a hydrogen column density @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the latter is larger than the typical value measured in terzan 5 @xcite and well in agreement with the hydrogen column density of the previously known transient exo 1745 - 248 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the subsequent position refinement by @xcite centered the system around exo 1745 - 248 with a @xmath11 error circle .",
    "these data therefore strongly suggest that the new swift / bat outburst coincides with exo 1745 - 248 , an x - ray neutron star transient that already showed outbursts in 2000 and 2011 @xcite .",
    "such an identification has been also confirmed by radio vla observations @xcite , which locate the source position within @xmath12 of the published coordinates of exo 1745 - 248 obtained from _ chandra _ data ( source cx3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent swift / xrt observations indicate that the source is probably on the way to transit to the soft state @xcite .",
    "such an intriguing object is not uncommon in terzan 5 .",
    "in fact , this stellar system is known to harbor several x - ray sources ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and to be the most efficient furnace of msps in the milky way : it harbors a total of 34 msps , corresponding to @xmath13 of the entire sample of such objects known to date in galactic globular clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently demonstrated that , at odds with what is commonly thought , terzan 5 is not a globular cluster , but a system hosting stellar populations characterized by significantly different iron abundances , spanning a total metallicity range of 1 dex ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the measured chemical patterns @xcite could be naturally explained in a scenario where terzan 5 was originally much more massive than today ( @xmath14 ; @xcite ) , thus to be able to retain the iron - enriched gas ejected by violent supernova explosions .",
    "the large number of type ii supernovae required to explain the observed abundance patterns should have also produced a large population of neutron stars , mostly retained into the deep potential well of the massive _ proto_-terzan 5 and likely forming binary systems through tidal capture interactions .",
    "finally , its large collision rate @xcite , the largest among all galactic globular clusters ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , could have highly promoted pulsar re - cycling processes , which can explain the production of the large population of msps / lmxbs now observed in the system .    since the x - ray outburst detected by swift",
    "is expected to also produce a significant enhancement of the optical luminosity ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , we successfully applied for hst director discretionary time to urgently survey the central region of terzan 5 and thus provide new insights into this still unexplored phase of the lmxb - to - msp path . here",
    "we report on the identification of the optical counterpart to exo 1745 - 248 obtained from the analysis of these images .",
    "to search for the expected optical emission from exo 1745 - 248 during its x - ray bursting phase , we submitted a hst director discretionary time proposal ( go 14061 , pi : ferraro ) asking for two orbits with the advanced camera for survey ( acs / wfc ) .",
    "the observations have been promptly performed on april 20 , 2015 , about one month into the x - ray outburst ( continuing at time of writing ) .",
    "the dataset ( hereafter epoch 3 , ep3 ) consists of @xmath15 s images in f606w , @xmath16 s images in f814w , and one short exposure per filter ( @xmath17 s and @xmath18 s , respectively ; these latter have not been used in the present work ) .",
    "previous optical images of terzan 5 acquired with the same instrument in the same filters were already present in the hst archive : go 12933 ( pi : ferraro ) performed on august 18th , 2013 ( hereafter ep2 ) , and go 9799 ( pi : rich ) performed on september 9th , 2003 ( hereafter ep1 ) .",
    "we already used these data to construct the deepest optical color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of terzan 5 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for the present study , all the datasets have been homogeneously analyzed , applying standard iraf procedures for pixel - area - map ( pam ) correction on the ( flc ) images corrected for charge transfer efficiency .",
    "the photometric analysis has been carried out by using the daophot package .",
    "for each image we modeled a moffat point spread function ( psf ) by using 150 - 200 bright and nearly isolated stars .",
    "afterwards , we performed source detection in each image imposing a 3-@xmath19 threshold over the background level . by using all the sources detected and psf fitted in at least 1 out of 2 images in ep1 , and 3 out of 10 images in ep2 and ep3",
    ", we then created a catalog for every epoch . in spite of including sources detected in only one filter , such an approach allowed us to avoid losing very faint ( but possibly real ) objects , while safely discarding spurious detections , as cosmic rays and detector artifacts",
    "the obtained master lists ( one for every epoch ) have been then used to identify the stellar sources in each single frame and the psf model has been applied to derive the final magnitudes . as a final step , to build the ep2 and ep3 catalogs we considered all the stars with magnitude measured in both filters in at least 3 out of 5 images , while the ep1 catalog obviously consists of the objects detected in both the available images .",
    "for each star , the magnitudes estimated in different images of the same filter have been homogenized ( see * ? ? ? * ) and their weighted mean and standard deviation have been finally adopted as the star magnitude and photometric error .",
    "the magnitude calibration to the vegamag system has been performed by using the catalog by @xcite as reference .    to precisely determine the star coordinates , we first applied the equations reported by @xcite and corrected the instrumental positions for the known geometric distortions affecting the acs images . through cross - correlation with the catalog of @xcite , which had been placed onto the 2mass system",

    "the blue line corresponds to a 12 gyr isochrone with [ fe / h]@xmath24 ( from @xcite ) , well reproducing the main metal poor sub - population of terzan 5 . ]",
    "the photometric analysis of our dataset in a region around the position of exo 1745 - 248 immediately revealed , in ep3 , the presence of a bright star that was not visible in ep1 and ep2 images ( see figure [ ident1 ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the three epochs unequivocally identifies the bright object ( hereafter com - exo 1745 - 248 ) as the optical counterpart to exo 1745 - 248 .",
    "the absolute position of the optical source is ra(j2000)@xmath25 , dec(j2000)@xmath26 .",
    "this is consistent at 1-@xmath19 with the vla position quoted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the red and the green circles in figure [ ident2 ] ) .",
    "instead , the star previously suggested as the possible optical counterpart to this x - ray transient @xcite is located @xmath27 to the west ( cyan square in the figure ) .",
    "after the astrometric transformations , the centroid position of the bright object in ep3 is within 0.05 pixels from the centroid of a fainter star clearly detected in ep1 and ep2 ( see figure [ cmd1 ] ) .",
    "this could be the optical counterpart caught in quiescence .",
    "the probability that the true counterpart is a fainter , non detected star aligned ( within 0.05 pixels ) along the line of sight is very low ( @xmath28 ) . ) from the cluster center is needed .",
    "since no data - set available for terzan 5 reaches such a faint magnitude limit , we adopted as reference the luminosity function of 47 tucanae derived from deep hst observations @xcite .",
    "star counts have been normalized to the number of terzan 5 stars counted between the turn off level and two magnitudes above , in a ring of @xmath29 width , centered at @xmath30 from the center . ] in addition , the brightness profile of this star does not show any significant deviation from symmetry , thus supporting the hypothesis that it is a single object .",
    "hence , the most natural conclusion is that identified star is indeed the counterpart in quiescence .",
    "the identified object passed from observed magnitudes m@xmath31 and m@xmath32 during quiescence ( ep1 and ep2 ) ; @xmath33 ) and ep2 ( @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ) quiescent stages are fully consistent within the errors . ] , to m@xmath36 and m@xmath37 in the outburst state ( ep3 ) , thus experiencing a brightening of 3 magnitudes ( corresponding to a factor 16 in luminosity ) .",
    "because of its location in the inner galactic bulge , terzan 5 is affected by a large extinction , with an average color excess @xmath38 @xcite , showing strong variations , up to @xmath39 mag , within the acs field of view @xcite .",
    "we therefore applied the high - resolution differential reddening map obtained by @xcite to correct the observed magnitudes ( in the following , the notation @xmath40 indicates magnitudes corrected for differential reddening ) .",
    "figure [ cmd1 ] shows the position of com - exo 1745 - 248 in the differential reddening corrected cmd during the two states .",
    "we found @xmath41 and @xmath42 during ep1 and ep2 , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 in ep3 , corresponding to a small ( 0.1 mag ) color variation , which is however within the errors .",
    "no variability has been detected over the period of @xmath45 min covered by each hst orbit in ep3 and ep2 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that ep3 data were acquired on april 20 , 2015 , almost simultaneously to the x - ray observations @xcite suggesting that the system is transiting from a hard to a soft state .",
    "an estimate of the orbital period of the system can be obtained by following @xcite , who reporte a relation between the orbital period and the @xmath46-band luminosity variation .",
    "since we observe @xmath47 mag in the case of exo 1745 - 248 , the orbital period turns out to be @xmath48 days . on the other hand",
    ", for lmxbs @xcite proposed an empirical relation between the absolute @xmath46 magnitude in outburst and the parameter @xmath49 , which depends on the ratio between the x - ray and the eddington luminosities ( @xmath50 ) and the orbital period . by assuming @xmath51 @xcite and @xmath52 ( in johnson @xmath46 magnitude ) for exo 1745 - 248",
    ", we obtain @xmath53 days . from these estimates ,",
    "the orbital period of the system is likely to be between 1.3 and 0.1 days .    in order to more",
    "deeply investigate the nature of com - exo 1745 - 248 in the quiescence state under the assumption that the disk contribution to the observed magnitude is negligible , we identified the star in the k - band adaptive optics images obtained with eso / mad , used by @xcite to discover the two main multi - iron populations hidden in this system .",
    "we have first corrected the combined @xmath54 m@xmath55 ) cmd for differential reddening .",
    "then we transformed it into the absolute plane by assuming the average color excess quoted above , and the distance modulus @xmath56 corresponding to a distance of 5.9 kpc @xcite . the result is shown in figure [ cmd2 ] , where the position of com - exo 1745 - 248 in the quiescent state is marked .",
    "a more detailed characterization of the nature of com - exo 1745 - 248 is strongly hampered by the complexity of the stellar populations harbored in terzan5 .",
    "the comparison with a 12 gyr old isochrone @xcite well reproducing the main metal - poor sub - population of terzan 5 , at [ fe / h]@xmath24 dex of the total , while a super - solar component at [ fe / h]@xmath57 dex accounts for @xmath58 , and an even metal poorer component , at [ fe / h]@xmath59 dex , recently detected by @xcite , corresponds to @xmath60 of the total .",
    "the cmd plotted in fig .",
    "[ cmd2 ] nicely shows two distinct red clumps at @xmath61 and @xmath621 , corresponding to the two major sub - populations first discovered in the system by @xcite . ]",
    "suggests that com - exo 1745 - 248 could be a sub - giant branch ( sgb ) star .",
    "on the other hand the metal - rich sub - population could be significantly ( a few gyr ) younger than the main metal poor component ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , if com - exo 1745 - 248 belongs to the metal - rich component , it would be located below the sgb , in a position where companions to redback msps have been found ( see , e.g. , the case of com - msp6397a in @xcite ) . since no spectroscopic information on the metallicity of this star is available , both possibilities are equivalently valid . while in the case of redbacks any prediction on the stellar parameters based on the observed photometric properties can be difficult ( see the case of com - msp6397a ) , this is possible for a sgb star belonging to the metal poor population . in this case , the following stellar parameters are obtained : mass @xmath63 , effective temperature @xmath64 k , surface gravity @xmath65 , and luminosity @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding stellar radius therefore is @xmath67 .",
    "hence , by assuming that the star has completely filled its roche lobe and adopting a canonical value for the neutron star mass ( @xmath68 ) , we derive an orbital separation @xmath69 and a period @xmath70 d for the binary system , fully in agreement with the range estimated above .",
    "we estimate that the radial velocity variations of such a binary system should have an amplitude of @xmath71 km s@xmath2 ( @xmath72 being the system inclination angle ) , which could be detectable through a dedicated spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "by using high - resolution images obtained with the hst / acs during three different epochs , we have identified the optical counterpart to the neutron star transient exo 1745 - 248 in terzan 5 . with respect to the two previous epochs",
    ", this object shows a current brightening of @xmath73 magnitudes . in the quiescence state",
    "it is a sub giant branch star , i.e. , an object that is experiencing its first envelope expansion , while evolving toward the red giant branch stage .",
    "very interestingly , the x - ray emission of exo 1745 - 248 during quiescence was found to be highly variable both on short and long time - scales @xcite , and @xcite recently underlined that these properties are impressively similar to those observed for msp - m28i , the system occasionally swinging between accretion - powered and rotation - powered emission @xcite .",
    "this evidence suggests that exo 1745 - 248 could be another system belonging the rare class of objects caught shortly before the formation of a radio msp , possibly in a stage immediately preceding the swinging phase in which msp - m28i has been observed .",
    "the characterization of exo 1745 - 248 offers the opportunity of adding an additional link to the evolutionary chain connecting lmxbs to msps .",
    "in fact , from the analysis of the data currently available we can speculate that exo1745 - 248 is experiencing the very early phase of the mass accretion stage , when an expanding star ( a sub giant branch object ) is filling its roche lobe and transferring material that eventually spins - up the neutron star .",
    "indeed , the few outbursts in the x - ray occurring during this stage unambiguously indicate that heavy mass accretion on the neutron star is taking place . as time passes , the mass accretion rate will decrease and the system will enter into the phase characterized by a cyclic alternation between accretion- and rotation - powered emission , as observed in the case of msp - m28i @xcite .",
    "thus , in the next future exo1745 - 248 is expected to possibly start swinging between the lmxb and the msp states . at later stages ,",
    "when the neutron star has been sufficiently re - accelerated , the emission is powered by the rotating magnetic field , preventing further significant mass accretion .",
    "the system will be observable as a redback , i.e. , a radio msp with a highly perturbed companion , with the roche lobe filled and some material still falling toward the neutron star .",
    "indeed , the prototype of this class of objects is msp - a in ngc 6397 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , which shows a light curve dominated by tidal distortions ( in agreement with the fact that the companion is a bloated , highly deformed star ) , prominent h@xmath74 lines ( confirming the existence of diffuse gas outside the companion roche lobe ; @xcite ) , and peculiar chemical patterns ( as expected for a deeply peeled star ; @xcite ) .",
    "the final fate will be that of a `` canonical msp '' , i.e. , a ns in a binary system with a wd companion ( the stripped core of the donor star ) .",
    "we warmly thank the referee , craig heinke , for the careful reading of the manuscript and useful suggestions that help improving the paper .",
