    "@xcite one has to explain the weak scale value of the @xmath5 parameter in the superpotential @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric models with additional singlet higgs fields evade the @xmath5 problem by replacing @xmath5 with a product of a dimensionless coupling and a vacuum expectation value of a singlet higgs field .",
    "the simplest extension of the mssm by one additional singlet higgs field is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite .",
    "models with additional u(1 ) factors in the gauge group containing new neutral gauge bosons are a further extension of the mssm @xcite .",
    "these models provide a solution to the domain - wall problem of the nmssm @xcite , because the discrete @xmath6 symmetry is embedded in the new u(1 ) factors @xcite .",
    "one or two additional u(1 ) factors can be motivated by the breaking of an @xmath0  group which is a good candidate of an ( effective ) gut group @xcite . since experimental results",
    "lead to strict lower mass bounds for the new gauge bosons , further studies are needed in order to understand the hierarchy between the gauge boson masses @xcite .",
    "also the susy breaking scale is typically of the order of the new gauge bosons .",
    "however , gaugino and slepton masses of some 100 gev at the electroweak scale are not excluded @xcite .",
    "the extended neutralino sector in these @xmath0  inspired u@xmath7 models will be discussed in detail in this work focusing especially on the differences to the mssm .",
    "the production of neutralinos at an electron - positron linear collider with polarized beams is considered as an excellent process to discriminate between the supersymmetric models .",
    "the experimental signatures certainly depend on the neutralino decay channels which are discussed for singlino - like lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsp ) in @xcite .",
    "especially one expects the existence of displaced decay vertices for large singlet vacuum expectation values @xcite .",
    "we discuss the neutralino phenomenology in two types of scenarios where the mass of the new gauge bosons is above the reach of the first generation of linear colliders with 500 to 800  gev center - of - mass energy . within the framework of constrained @xmath0  models with gut relations between the soft supersymmetry breaking masses of order 100  gev the lighter four neutralinos have mssm - like character .",
    "assuming msugra - type rge relations for the sfermion masses , the masses of the left and right selectrons in the constrained @xmath0  models considerably differ from the ones in the constrained mssm .",
    "especially if the selectrons can not be directly produced at a linear collider , neutralino production may offer valuable information about the underlying supersymmetric model .",
    "the selectron rge relations in @xmath0  models can be tested in scenarios with gaugino - like light neutralinos while particularly the polarization asymmetries of the production cross sections of higgsino dominated neutralinos show new gauge boson resonance effects at energies well below their masses .    in a second type of scenarios",
    "we relax the gut and rge relations and obtain singlino - like light neutralinos for large values of the soft breaking u@xmath7 gaugino mass parameter .",
    "then neutralino production provides a favorable way to determine the neutralino character and the parameters of the underlying supersymmetric model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we analyze the neutralino sector of the @xmath0  inspired models with new u(1 ) factors and discuss the mass spectra of the neutralinos in these models which contain up to four exotic singlino and new gaugino states . in section 3 the production of neutralinos in electron - positron collisions",
    "is analyzed in representative scenarios where the lightest mssm - like neutralino has gaugino or higgsino character .",
    "we work out differences of the cross sections and polarization asymmetries between the mssm and the extended models for mssm - like light neutralinos and discuss as well the production of exotic singlino - like neutralinos . in the appendix",
    "we give a brief overview of the @xmath0  models focusing mainly on the breaking of the @xmath0  group resulting in new u(1 ) factors and on the particle content .",
    "we discuss the mass terms of the gauge bosons , charginos and sfermions , which have a significantly different mass spectrum than in the mssm and the nmssm because of additional d - terms of the new u(1 ) factors .",
    "the relevant couplings for production and decay of the neutralinos in the @xmath0  models can also be found in the appendix .",
    "the additional gauge bosons and singlet higgs fields in @xmath0  inspired models lead to an extended neutralino sector which may be crucial in order to distinguish between these models and the mssm or nmssm in future high energy collider experiments .",
    "the breaking of a gut group @xmath0  can lead to low energy gauge groups with one ( rank 5 ) or two ( rank 6 ) additional u(1 ) factors in comparison to the sm ( app .  [ e6breaking ] ) .",
    "the particle spectrum of the @xmath0  models contains two neutral sm singlet fields which can be interpreted as singlet higgs fields ( app .",
