    "until recently , however , it was not clear whether the dominant energy source was an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) or a starburst .",

    "* efstathiou ( 2006 ) ) proposed that the sed of iras f10214 + 4724 could be understood in terms of three components of emission : clouds that are associated with the narrow - line region and with a covering factor of 17% , an edge - on torus and a highly obscured starburst .",
    "it was also noted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* efstathiou ( 2006 ) ) , however , that because the emission from the torus and the narrow - line region clouds arises from diferent regions their magnification may be different .    in this paper",
    "we develop a new model for the infrared emission of iras f10214 + 4724 which takes into account new photometric data from _",

    "* efstathiou , rowan - robinson & siebenmorgen ( 2000 ) ) developed a starburst model that has three main features : the first feature of the model is that it incorporates the stellar population synthesis model of bruzual & charlot that gives the spectrum of the stars as a function of their age .",
    "* efstathiou , rowan - robinson & siebenmorgen ( 2000 ) ) used the table that assumes a salpeter imf and stellar masses in the range 0.1 - 125 @xmath2 .",
    "the second important feature of the model is that it involves detailed radiative transfer that takes into account multiple scattering from grains and incorporates a dust model that includes small transiently heated grains and pah molecules as well as large classical grains . for the calculation of the emission of the small grains and pahs the method of",
    "was employed .",
    "the third feature of the model is that it incorporates a simple model for the evolution of the giant molecular clouds that constitute the starburst once a stellar cluster forms instantaneously at the center of the cloud .",
    "the most important characteristic of this evolutionary scheme is that by about 10 myrs after star formation , the expansion of the hii region leads to the formation of a cold narrow shell of gas and dust .",
    "this naturally explains why the mid - infrared spectra of starburst galaxies are dominated by the pah emission and not by the emission of hot dust .",
    "the sequence of molecular clouds at different ages can be convolved with a star formation history to give the spectrum of a starburst at different ages .",
