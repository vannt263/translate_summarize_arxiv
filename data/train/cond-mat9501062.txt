    "resonant tunneling through two planar barriers in series is a textbook problem in quantum mechanics . because of the separation of longitudinal and transverse motion ,",
    "the problem is essentially one - dimensional and can be solved in an elementary way .",
    "realistic double - barrier junctions contain in general some amount of disorder in the region between the barriers . at low temperatures and small applied voltages ,",
    "the inelastic electron - phonon and electron - electron scattering processes are suppressed , but the elastic scattering by impurities remains .",
    "scattering events couple the transverse and longitudinal motion of the tunneling electron , which substantially complicates the problem but also leads to novel physical effects .",
    "the effects of disorder have been studied in the past  @xcite with an emphasis on isolated transmission resonances ( energy spacing between the resonances much greater than their width ) .",
    "those studies are relevant for tunneling through a semiconductor quantum well , where the resonances are widely separated because the barrier separation @xmath5 is comparable to the fermi wavelength @xmath6 . in the present paper",
    "we consider the opposite regime @xmath7 of strongly overlapping resonances , relevant to metal structures ( where @xmath6 is very short , comparable to the inter - atomic separation ) , or to tunneling in the plane of a two - dimensional electron gas ( where @xmath5 can be quite long , because of the large phase - coherence length ) .",
    "two types of disorder can play a role , interface roughness at the barriers and impurities between the barriers .",
    "interface roughness leads to mesoscopic ( sample - to - sample ) fluctuations in the conductance even in the absence of any phase coherence , because the tunnel probability @xmath8 of a single barrier depends strongly on its thickness .",
    "conductance fluctuations for a single rough tunnel barrier have been studied by raikh and ruzin .",
    "@xcite here we consider the case of impurity scattering in the absence of interface roughness .",
    "phase coherence is then essential .",
    "a methodological difference with earlier work on resonant tunneling is our use of random - matrix theory to describe the mode - mixing in the inter - barrier region .",
    "we assume that the disorder is weak enough that its effect on the average conductance is negligibly small .",
    "this requires a mean free path @xmath9 .",
    "still , the disorder should be sufficiently strong to fully mix the transverse modes in the inter - barrier region .",
    "this requires both @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the transverse dimension of the junction ) .",
    "we may then describe the disorder - induced mode - mixing by a random @xmath13 unitary matrix ( @xmath14 being the total number of propagating transverse modes at the fermi energy ) .",
    "this single assumption permits a complete analytical solution of the statistical properties of the conductance , using basic results for the so - called circular ensemble of random matrices .",
    "@xcite the circular ensemble is fully characterized by the symmetry index @xmath15 , which equals 1 in the presence of time - reversal symmetry ( circular orthogonal ensemble ) and 2 if time - reversal symmetry is broken by a magnetic field ( circular unitary ensemble ) .",
    "( a third possibility , @xmath16 , applies to zero magnetic field in the presence of strong spin - orbit scattering . )    as described in sec .",
    "ii , we find that the conductance @xmath0 of the double - barrier junction exhibits sample - to - sample fluctuations around the classical series conductance @xmath17 ( we denote by @xmath18 and @xmath19 the transmission probabilities per mode through barrier 1 and 2 , and assume that these are mode - independent and @xmath20 . )",
    "we find that the root - mean - square fluctuations @xmath21 of the conductance depend only on the ratio @xmath22 of the two transmission probabilities , according to @xmath23 corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gnu ] ) are smaller by a factor @xmath24 , which is @xmath25 if @xmath26 . for a symmetric junction @xmath27 the fluctuations are of order @xmath1 , independent of @xmath14 or @xmath28 ( as long as @xmath26 ) .",
    "this universality is reminiscent of the universal conductance fluctuations in diffusive metals .",
    "@xcite just as in those systems , we expect the sample - to - sample fluctuations to be observable in a single sample , as reproducible fluctuations of the conductance as a function of fermi energy or magnetic field .",
    "( [ eq : gnu ] ) assumes weak disorder , @xmath29 ( but still @xmath30 ) .",
    "we generalize our results in sec .",
    "iii to stronger disorder , when the effects of the impurities on the average conductance have to be taken into account .",
    "as in a previous paper ,  @xcite where we considered a point - contact geometry , we do this by means of the dorokhov - mello - pereyra - kumar ( dmpk ) equation .",
    "@xcite we find that impurity scattering leads to the appearance of a weak - localization effect on the average conductance ( observable as a negative magnetoresistance ) .",
    "the conductance fluctuations become independent of @xmath18 and @xmath19 if @xmath31 a similar conclusion was reached previously by iida , weidenmller , and zuk ,  @xcite who studied the conductance fluctuations of a chain of disordered grains as a function of the coupling strength to two electron reservoirs .",
    "these authors found that the universal conductance fluctuations are recovered for a chain length @xmath5 much greater than some length @xmath32 which is parametrically greater than the mean free path . a more detailed comparison with ref .",
    "is not possible , because we consider a homogeneously disordered conductor rather than a chain of disordered grains .    to test our random - matrix description of mode - mixing by weak disorder , we present in sec .",
    "iv results from a numerical simulation of a disordered double - barrier junction defined on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the agreement with the theory is quite reasonable .",
    "two appendices to the paper contain some technical material which we need in the main text : in app .",
    "a we present the analogue of the dyson - mehta formula  @xcite for the circular ensemble , which expresses the variance of the conductance as a fourier series . in app .",
    "b we discuss the application to our problem of the method of moments  @xcite for the dmpk equation .",
    "the double - barrier junction considered is shown schematically in the inset of fig .  1 .",
    "since we assume @xmath33 , the scattering matrix @xmath34 of the whole system can be constructed from the scattering matrices @xmath35 of the individual barriers .",
    "the @xmath36 unitary matrix @xmath35 contains two @xmath37 submatrices @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( reflection from left to left and from right to right ) and two other @xmath13 submatrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( transmission from left to right and from right to left ) .",

    "we assume in this section that mode - mixing is the dominant effect of the disorder , and that the reduction of the average conductance by the impurity scattering can be neglected .",
