    "in its recent critical assessment of the results from the first three years at rhic @xcite , the star collaboration identified several important open questions regarding the nature of the hot , dense matter that is being created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . during this conference , star has presented a broad range of important new measurements that address these questions .",
    "these measurements are surveyed in @xcite . here , we focus on a few of the qualitatively new results .    at midrapidity , high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) charged particle yields @xcite and back - to - back azimuthal correlations @xcite are strongly suppressed in central au+au collisions , relative to those in p+p and d+au @xcite collisions .",
    "these results have been taken as evidence for partonic energy loss due to induced gluon radiation @xcite in the dense medium that is created in central au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "this suppression is so strong that it implies most of the observed high-@xmath0 hadrons originate near the surface of the collision zone and provide little information about the central density @xcite .",
    "one needs more penetrating probes to explore the central region of the collision . at this conference",
    ", star has shown first results for two such probes , heavy flavor and di - jet yields at very high @xmath0 .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum require that the suppression of high-@xmath0 particle production must be associated with increased production at lower @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , the back - to - back azimuthal correlations between high-@xmath0 trigger particles and low-@xmath0 associated particles are strongly enhanced and broadened in central au+au collisions , and the @xmath1 of the associated particles approaches that of the bulk medium @xcite .",
    "the study of hard - soft correlations provides information both about the modification of jet fragmentation within the dense medium and the response of the dense medium to the jet . at this conference",
    ", star has shown first results for three - particle , hard - soft correlations that provide detailed information about the interplay between these two effects .",

    "charm and bottom quarks , with their heavy masses , are expected to be produced early in a relativistic heavy - ion collision , and then to experience reduced coupling to the surrounding medium @xcite . at this conference ,",
    "star reported the first direct reconstruction of @xmath2 mesons in au+au collisions @xcite and the first measurement of non - photonic electron yields at high @xmath0 in central au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : heavy ] shows that the yield of low-@xmath0 @xmath2 mesons in minimum - bias au+au collisions scales with @xmath3 @xcite , as expected . the charm production total cross section , which is dominated by the low-@xmath0 contribution , is 1.11 @xmath4 0.08(stat . )",

    "fig : heavy ] also shows that the yield of non - photonic electrons , which are believed to arise from the decay of charm and bottom hadrons , is strongly suppressed in central au+au collisions at intermediate @xcite and high @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the suppression , a factor of four to five relative to pp collisions for @xmath5 gev / c , is comparable to that observed for inclusive charged hadrons at @xmath6 gev / c @xcite .",
    "this contradicts theoretical expectations that heavy flavor hadrons should be less suppressed than light hadrons due to the ` dead cone ' effect @xcite .",
    "previous energy loss calculations based on gluon radiation @xcite predicted that @xmath7 for non - photonic electrons would saturate at 0.5 @xmath8 0.6 .",
    "the calculations are only able to reproduce the observed suppression if they assume extreme medium densities ",

    "the high statistics of the 200 gev au+au run 4 data have permitted star to push the trigger and associated particle thresholds to much higher @xmath0 than has been practical in previous au+au di - jet studies @xcite . figure [ fig : dphi_dists ] shows that a well - defined back - to - back peak , characteristic of di - jets , is observed with negligible background in both peripheral and central au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "the widths of the back - to - back peaks appear to be independent of centrality , but the coincident yield is substantially less in central au+au collisions than in peripheral collisions .",
    "the latter is quantified in fig .",
    "[ fig : zt_away_dists ] , which shows the away - side hadron - triggered fragmentation functions @xcite for d+au and au+au collisions @xcite , as a function of @xmath13 .",

    "the unmodified shape within the observed @xmath15 range is consistent with previous predictions , but the magnitude is smaller than expected @xcite .",
    "a different calculation predicted that significant energy loss , as evidenced by the au+au / d+au ratio of @xmath140.25 , should be associated with significant broadening of the away - side hadron azimuthal distribution @xcite , in contrast to the data .",
    "the simultaneous observations of significant suppression of the very high-@xmath0 back - to - back yields in conjunction with little or no modification of the away - side width or hadron - triggered fragmentation function will provide a significant challenge to partonic energy loss models .",

    "when low-@xmath0 associated particles are observed in central au+au collisions opposite a higher-@xmath0 trigger particle , they are found to be significantly enhanced in number and broadened in @xmath17 relative to pp collisions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 of the associated particles appears to be a minimum at @xmath17 = @xmath18 in central au+au collisions @xcite , in contrast to the maximum found in pp and d+au collisions .",
    "in addition , the away - side associated particle yield is flat or may have a small dip at @xmath17 = @xmath18 @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : int_pt_dphi ] .",
    "these novel phenomena have led to predictions that we may be observing jets that have been deflected by radial flow or a mach cone effect associated with conical shock waves @xcite .",
    "star has explored three - particle correlations @xcite in the intermediate-@xmath0 region where these novel phenomena appear to be most pronounced in order to identify the underlying physical processes .",
    "figure [ fig : three_part ] shows the result for minimum bias d+au collisions and central au+au collisions when the true three - particle component is isolated by subtracting off the backgrounds due to all combinations of two associated particles in random coincidence with a third , in addition to the contribution from triple random coincidences @xcite .",
    "both distributions contain the four peaks expected from di - jet production , and the peaks near @xmath19 appear broadened along the diagonal . in d+au collisions ,",
    "this broadening may arise from @xmath20 effects that produce acoplanarity between partner jets .",
    "in au+au collisions , an enhanced yield along the diagonal may arise from @xmath20 effects or deflected jets .",
    "conical flow should enhance the off - diagonal yield , for example near @xmath21 .",
    "however , for these @xmath0 ranges we find the off - diagonal coincidence yield to be substantially less than that along the diagonal @xcite , in contrast to this expectation .",
    "ranges are @xmath22 gev / c for the trigger particle and @xmath23 gev / c for the two associated particles . ]",
    "during this conference , star has shown that the yields of high-@xmath0 non - photonic electrons , which are believed to arise from heavy flavor , are strongly suppressed in central au+au collisions .",
    "the suppression is comparable to that observed for light hadrons .",
    "back - to - back di - jets have been observed unambiguously in central au+au collisions at very high @xmath0 .",
    "the yield relative to d+au is suppressed by a factor of @xmath144 , similar to the suppression of inclusive particle yields , but the fragmentation function and the width of the back - to - back azimuthal distribution appear unmodified within the measured region .",
    "together , the heavy flavor and di - jet measurements will provide a severe test of our understanding of partonic energy loss in hot , dense matter , and may lead to an upper bound on the energy density of the matter as needed to obtain a lower limit on the number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "three - particle correlations at intermediate @xmath0 have been measured in central au+au collisions to explore the response of the medium when probed by an energetic parton .",
    "the present data show the pattern expected from @xmath20 effects or deflected jets , while the characteristic signature of conical flow is not observed .    star has presented a wealth of new data at this conference that provide answers to several of the questions that were raised in the recent star critical assessment of the rhic results from runs 1 , 2 , and 3 @xcite .",
    "however , the new data also raise new questions .",
    "for example , it is not clear whether the new results are consistent with the conventional picture that presumes partonic energy loss is dominated by induced gluon radiation .",
    "ultimately , the answers to all of these questions will tell us the nature of the strongly interacting matter that we are creating at rhic ."
