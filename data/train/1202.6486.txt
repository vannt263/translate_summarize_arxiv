    "in recent years many activities have been devoted to the study of dynamic processes far from equilibrium .",
    "an example is the domain - wall dynamics in disordered media , which is important from both experimental and theoretical perspectives .",
    "a crucial feature of the driven domain interface in disordered media is the _ depinning _ phase transition at zero temperature . for the domain - wall motion in ultrathin magnetic films ,",
    "the edwards - wilkinson equation with quenched disorder ( qew ) is a typical theoretical approach @xcite .",
    "it is usually believed that different variants of the model belong to a same universality class .",
    "the qew equation is a phenomenological model , without detailed microscopic structures and interactions of the materials .",
    "the domain wall in a two - dimensional system is effectively described by a single - valued elastic string .",
    "an alternative , possibly more realistic approach , may be to construct lattice models at the microscopic level .",
    "the two - dimensional random - field ising model with a driving field ( drfim ) is the simplest example @xcite . in the drfim model ,",
    "overhangs and islands may be created during the dynamic evolution , and the domain wall is not single - valued and one dimensional .",
    "the drfim model is closer to experiments @xcite and does not suffer from the theoretical self - inconsistence as in the qew equation @xcite .",
    "very recently it has been demonstrated that the drfim model may not belong to the universality class of the qew equation @xcite . to distinguish these two models ,",
    "one needs accurate measurements of the critical exponents . in this respect ,",
    "the short - time dynamic approach has been proven to be efficient @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the universality class of the drfim model . in refs .",
    "@xcite , monte carlo simulations are performed at a fixed strength of the random fields with a uniform distribution , i.e. , @xmath4 . in this paper",
    ", we systematically investigate the possible dependence of the critical exponents on the strength and form of the random fields , and the updating schemes of the monte carlo algorithm , including the crossover from the second - order transition to the first - order one . on the other hand",
    ", we measure not only the global and local roughness exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 , but also the _ spectral _ roughness exponent @xmath1 , to identify the dynamic universality class of the domain interface . following ref .",
    "@xcite , there are four different universality classes in the interface growth , namely , @xmath7 in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it suggests that there is a new universality class of _ anomalous roughening _",

    "the depinning transition is of second - order for both the uniform and gaussian distributions .",
    "as @xmath17 decreases , the depinning transition crosses over to a first - order one for the uniform distribution which is bounded .",

    "we first concentrate on the uniform distribution of the random fields and the random - single - spin - flip monte carlo algorithm , and then extend the calculations to the gaussian distribution and to different updating schemes .",

    "<S> with monte carlo methods , we investigate the universality class of the depinning transition in the two - dimensional ising model with quenched random fields . based on the short - time dynamic approach , we accurately determine the depinning transition field and both static and dynamic critical exponents . </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponents vary significantly with the form and strength of the random fields , but exhibit independence on the updating schemes of the monte carlo algorithm . from the roughness exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 , one may judge that the depinning transition of the random - field ising model belongs to the new dynamic universality class with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the crossover from the second - order phase transition to the first - order one is observed for the uniform distribution of the random fields , but it is not present for the gaussian distribution . </S>"
