    "recent leading topics in heavy fermion ( hf ) compounds physics are unconventional superconductivity and marginal fermi liquid behaviour . since these phenomena often occur in the vicinity of a magnetic instability , the concept of quantum phase transition has attracted a lot of attention both on experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite sides .",
    "such a transition between a magnetically ordered state and a paramagnetic state occurs at @xmath4=0 k for a critical value , @xmath5 , of a non thermal tuning parameter @xmath6 ( @xmath6 being experimentally controlled by pressure , alloying or magnetic field ) . the @xmath4=0 k , @xmath6=@xmath5 point of the phase diagram is called the quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) is a key probe to study spin fluctuations at a qcp in order to know to which extend the characteristics of the dynamical spin susceptibility can explain the anomalous bulk properties of these materials .",
    "peculiar behavior is expected because statics and dynamics are inextricably mixed at @xmath4=0 k. as a consequence , the effective dimension of the system @xmath7 equals @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the space dimension and @xmath10 is the dynamical exponent @xcite .",
    "this implies that a quantum critical system is in better position to be above the upper critical dimension than a classical one .",
    "thus a mean field behavior is therefore expected at the qcp .",
    "while many ins studies have been performed near the qcp , only a few works were extensively performed on single crystal samples where the full wavewector ( @xmath11 ) dependence can be investigated .",
    "such studies concern cecu@xmath12 doped with au ( karlsruhe group ) , ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 doped with la ( grenoble group ) and doped with rh ( tokyo - osaka group ) .    for the system ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 ,",
    "large single crystals of good quality are available for several concentrations @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the three dimensional ising compound ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite is an archetypal hf system with a pauli paramagnetic ground state .",
    "strong correlations between lattice , electronic and magnetic properties are evidenced under magnetic field where pseudo - metamagnetic transition occurs at @xmath13=7.8 t and also upon doping where magnetic long range order ( lro ) sets in . for ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2",
    ", a qcp is reached at @xmath14=0.075 that separates a paramagnetic ground state ( @xmath3 @xmath15 @xmath14 ) with dynamical short range correlations @xcite from an antiferromagnetic ground state ( @xmath3 @xmath16 @xmath14 ) with the incommensurate propagation vector @xmath17=(0.31 , 0 , 0 ) and the magnetic moments along the tetragonal @xmath18-axis @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we review recent works performed on this system and give complimentary results obtained on several concentrations @xmath3=0 , 0.065 and 0.075 concerning both the statics and the dynamics in order to tighten the conclusions previously obtained .",
    "data analysis is discussed in the viewpoint of basic properties of the dynamical spin susceptibility and with a minimum reference to a specific lineshape or a specific theory .",
    "the scaling approach that was highly developped in recent years is also discussed .",
    "the important contribution of ins in magnetism stems from the fact that the scattered neutron intensity , for a given wavevector @xmath11 and a given enery @xmath19 , is proportional to the scattering function @xmath20 , from which the imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibilty @xmath21 is easily deduced using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath22 while the main features of the excitation spectrum of the paramagnetic phase of ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 are known for two decades @xcite , recent progresses in ins intrumentation ( with consequences in data collection rate ) allow to map details of the spin dynamics for @xmath3=0 @xcite and @xmath3=0.075 @xcite .",
    "the softening of the spin fluctuations between @xmath3=0 and @xmath3=0.075 was reported a decade ago @xcite as well as on applying pressure starting from @xmath3=0.13 @xcite .",
    "the microscopic parameters extracted from the dynamical spin susceptibility were used as an input to describe @xcite the bulk properties of these compounds with the spin fluctuations theory of moriya @xcite . the imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility , @xmath21 , is shown in fig.1 for @xmath3=0 at 180 mk and @xmath3=0.075 at 40 mk and 2.3 k , for the momentum transfer @xmath23=(0.69 , 1 , 0 ) corresponding to the wavevector @xmath24 where lro sets in for @xmath25 .",
    "the relaxation behaviour of @xmath21 for these compounds is well described by a lorentzian lineshape @xcite .",
    "no absolute calibration of the intensity is made and the data are normalized to each other at high energy , with the hand - waving argument that the spin dynamics at high energy is , at first approximation , independent of @xmath4 and @xmath3 . for @xmath3=0 , the maximum ( @xmath26 in fig.1 ) of @xmath21",
    "is well observed in the experimental window limited by the instrumental resolution ( here to @xmath27 0.25 mev ) . on the other hand , for the critical concentration @xmath28=0.075 ,",
    "only the fall off of @xmath21 is measurable ( data with better resolution are shown in ref.@xcite but do not allow to reach @xmath26 either ) .",
    "this experimental difficulty is a general aspect of the measurement of a critical dynamical spin susceptibility at low temperature by ins ( on the contrary nmr gives access to the initial slope for @xmath19 @xmath29 0 ) .",
    "comparative data similar to the ones shown in fig.1 are also available for cecu@xmath30au@xmath1 for @xmath3=0 and the critical concentration @xmath28=0.1 ( see inset of fig.4 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "study of the spin dynamics of ce(ru@xmath0fe@xmath1)@xmath2ge@xmath2 ( polycrystalline samples ) for several @xmath3=0.65 , 0.76 , 0.87 around the qcp also put in perspective the interest of such a comparison @xcite .     at @xmath4=180 mk for ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 and @xmath4=40 mk , 2.3 k for ce@xmath31la@xmath32ru@xmath2si@xmath2.,width=226 ]    on general ground ,",
    "@xmath21 must go to zero for large @xmath19 and is also an odd function of @xmath19 . as a consequence , there will always be a maximum of @xmath21 at a given value @xmath26 and this whatever the shape of @xmath21 ( for a lorentzian shape , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the relaxation rate ) .",
    "such a peak that does not correspond to a pole of the susceptibility is sometime referred to the paramagnon peak @xcite .",
    "the energy @xmath26 characterizes the crossover between low and high frequency dynamics for gapless systems @xcite .",
    "its determination is thus somehow not unique ; it leads to several possible data analysis @xcite .",
    "however , it provides an energy scale for the system at a given reduced wavevector @xmath11 and temperature @xmath4 . in the general case",
    ", we can write @xmath35+@xmath36@xmath37 . for a given @xmath38 , the case @xmath390",
    ", @xmath40=1 corresponds to a so - called scaling in @xmath41 of the dynamical spin susceptibility .",
    "such a case is often referred to be characteristic of quantum critical scenario , where there is no other energy scale than the temperature itself at the qcp @xcite .",
    "a detailed experimental illustration of such a behavior is provided by ins studies on the compound cecu@xmath42au@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the observation of @xmath41 scaling below about 5 k in this compound is however suprising since it is not expected for the qcp of a three dimensional itinerant antiferromagnet that lies above the upper critical dimension .",
    "this experimental result led to the developement of a new scenario of quantum criticality , the so - called local scenario @xcite , where the local term stems from the experimental fact that the temperature dependence of the @xmath11 dependent susceptibility @xmath44 does not depend on @xmath45 ( and also @xmath46 is independent of @xmath45 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with itinerant magnetism , for which it is well known that the bulk susceptibility and the staggered susceptibility have different temperature variations at low temperature @xcite .",
    "the expected relaxational behaviour for a three dimensional itinerant quantum critical antiferromagnet was measured by kadowaki et al .",
    "@xcite in ce(ru@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2si@xmath2 ( @xmath3=0 , 0.03 ) at the wavevector of instability @xmath47=(0 , 0 , 0.35 ) , where the expected value @xmath48=3/2 is found below approximately 15 k .",
    "a possible explanation for the distinct behaviour at the qcp of ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 and cecu@xmath12 is the different values of the kondo temperature , being 5 - 10 times less in cecu@xmath12 ( see e.g. table 1 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this asks for very low temperature measurement for cecu@xmath42au@xmath43 in order to compare the same temperature regime than in ceru@xmath2si@xmath2-based systems @xcite .",
    "higher temperature relaxation was measured in ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 at @xmath14 @xcite in a temperature range ( 2.5 - 80 k ) , where @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "a value @xmath52=0.8 @xmath53 0.05 was found for @xmath17 while a lower value of 0.6 @xmath53 0.2 was found for a wavevector away from the critical value , where kondo - like fluctuations are expected . in stark contrast ,",
    "studies on the related system ce(ru@xmath0fe@xmath1)@xmath2ge@xmath2 found @xmath54=1 for every @xmath45 with a behaviour that is neither explained by the local scenario nor by the itinerant scenario @xcite .",
    "intersite correlations are at the center of magnetic phase transitions ( as far as lro is concerned as opposed to e.g. spin - glass ground state ) .",
    "the discussion of the characteristic lenght scale ( the inverse correlation length , @xmath55 ) follows similarly to the discussion of the characteristic energy scale .",
    "both quantities are in principle related by the dynamical exponent @xmath10 with @xmath56 .",
    "while @xmath10 is important for the dynamics of a classical phase transition @xcite , its importance for a quantum phase transition is already at the level of statics , since it increases the dimension of the system from @xmath9 to @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath34 as a function of @xmath55 is shown in fig.2 for ce@xmath31la@xmath57ru@xmath2si@xmath2 , temperature being an implicit parameter . by forcing the condition @xmath34=0 for @xmath55=0",
    ", we obtained the value @xmath10=2 ( the result of the fit being @xmath10=2.1@xmath53 0.2 ) , as expected for an itinerant antiferromagnet .",
    "in such a plot , @xmath34 is obtained by the fit of an energy spectrum as in fig.1 for several temperatures , while @xmath55 is obtained by fitting consistently many @xmath45 scans performed at constant energy ( as the one shown in fig.6 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "while the exponent @xmath10 is at the heart of quantum criticality , we are paradoxically not aware of any plot as the one shown in fig.2 for other hf systems .     as a function of the inverse correlation length @xmath55 of ce@xmath31la@xmath32ru@xmath2si@xmath2 .",
    "the line is a fit to @xmath34=a@xmath58.,width=226 ]    in the ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 system , the softening at @xmath28 is not complete since the relaxation rate is finite for @xmath59 0 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this is seen in fig.1 where the data obtained at @xmath28 for 40 mk and 2.3 k are almost identical .",
    "for this reason and also because a tiny static ordered moment appears at @xmath61 ( see next section ) , the present system does not provide , at first sight , a `` textbook '' example of quantum criticality .",
    "possible explanations for such deviation are that the transition is first order or that other degrees of freedom must be taken into account .",
    "the former possibility includes scenarii based on the rich physics of local defects in quantum critical systems @xcite .",
    "the latter possibility occurs for example in the `` textbook '' quantum critical compound lihof@xmath62 , where the expected mode softening does not occur and is `` masked '' by hyperfine coupling @xcite .",
    "however a study of the behavior of the spin dynamics at high temperature enough will provide relevant information on the so - called quantum critical region , whatever the exact position in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the presence , in the @xmath63 phase diagram , of two crossover temperatures @xmath64 and @xmath65 between the quantum disordered regime ( @xmath66 ) and the quantum critical regime ( @xmath67 ) @xcite . for heavy fermion systems",
    ", the @xmath64 line corresponds to the coherence temperature below which a fermi liquid ground state is formed . above @xmath64 ,",
    "thermal effects arise as perturbations while the regime above @xmath65 is completly controlled by the temperature . for a three dimensional itinerant antiferromagnet ,",
    "the crossover temperatures follow @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these crossover temperatures can be determined by measuring the temperature dependence of different macrocopic quantities like the specific heat , the resistivity and the susceptibility or of microcopic quantities like the dynamical spin susceptibility and by separating , with choosen criterions , the temperature independent , weakly - temperature dependent and strongly temperature dependent regimes .",
    "measurements at @xmath14 ( where @xmath64=0 and @xmath65=0 ) down to @xmath4=0 k will have similar characteristic exponents than measurements performed for @xmath25 and @xmath67 .",
    "for this reason , analysis of the spin fluctuations of ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 system is sound in the context of quantum criticality .",
    "this is emphasized by the fact that the theory of moriya allows to describe consistently the spin dynamics and the thermodynamic properties of this system @xcite and by the recent observation of the characteristic relaxation rate in @xmath70 for several @xmath3 near the qcp@xcite .",
    "a small moment ordered phase is reported for the critical concentration @xmath28=0.075 @xcite with the same ordering vector than the lro phase and with @xmath71=0.02 @xmath72 , @xmath73= 1.8 k and a finite correlation length of about 200 @xmath74 . in comparison with @xmath3=0.08 ,",
    "the nel temperature is similar but the moment is one order of magnitude smaller . for @xmath3=0 , @xmath75sr reports a static moment of 10@xmath76 @xmath72 below 2 k @xcite .",
    "thus , tiny ordered moments are detected below @xmath14 with however a clear finite correlation length .",
    "to further study this phase , a composition @xmath3=0.065 slightly below @xmath28 was investigated .",

    "the peak measured here , although static , has a finite correlation length of 74 @xmath74 ( 17 ce - ce interspacing ) at 2.7 k. the signal is proportional to the volume of the sample ( as checked by masking several parts ) excluding thus macroscopic millimetric heterogeneities .",

    "the magnitude of the magnetic moment at 2.7 k is of about the same as in the compound at @xmath14 .",
    "the intrinsic origin of small moment antiferromagnetism ( smaf ) is open ( see ref .",
    "difficult experimental investigations are required .",
    "the difficult point is the extreme sensitivity on the pressure and the uniaxial stress close to the qcp .",

    "large uncertainties in the nel temperature are due to rounding of the transitions @xcite . clearly the spin fluctuations prediction , @xmath83 ,",
    "is not followed .",
    "one interpretation is that the feedback effect of the kondo screening on the magnetic ordering is not well taken into account ( in this theory , the kondo effect is phenomenologically taken at the first step only as a relaxation mechanism @xcite . ) .",
    "a simple analysis of the reduction of an ordered magnetic moment in presence of the kondo effect was put forward in a study on cepd@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite leading to the following relation : @xmath84    = 0 k ordered magnetic moment , @xmath71 , as a function of the nel temperature for ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 .",

    "the inset shows the same curve for cerh@xmath2si@xmath2.,width=226 ]    such a formula is aiming to reproduce the fact that the kondo effect realizes a singlet by splitting a magnetic kramers doublet ( of paramagnetic moment @xmath85 ) by an amount @xmath86 .",
    "the line in fig 4 corresponds to a fit to ( 1 ) and gives @xmath85=1.6 ( 0.3 ) @xmath72 and @xmath87= 9 ( 2 ) k. given the crude model , such values correspond fairly well to the crystal field ground state magnetic moment of the ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 ( 2 @xmath72 ) and the average kondo temperature of 15 k over the serie .",
    "in such a picture , a large kondo temperature will lead to the possibility of having small moments with large nel temperatures .",

    "the change of behavior from large to small moment pointed forward for cerh@xmath2si@xmath2 under pressure@xcite can be , to this respect , understood from ( 1 ) given the large kondo temperature of this compound of about 50 k. this is shown in the inset of fig.4 where the data of ref@xcite are fitted by ( 1 ) giving @xmath85=1.8 ( 0.1 ) @xmath72 and @xmath87= 55 ( 3 ) k. here again the pertinence of the obtained parameters is suprising for a such rough phenomenological model .",
    "in ref.@xcite , it was found that the dynamical spin susceptibility of ce@xmath31la@xmath57ru@xmath2si@xmath2 follows , for the wavevector of instability @xmath17 and for 2.5 k @xmath88",
