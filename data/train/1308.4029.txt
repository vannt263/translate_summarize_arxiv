    "variance - based urs , such as those of heisenberg , robertson and schrdinger  @xcite , are the most popular ones ; they exhibit a state - dependent lower bound for the product of the variances of a pair of non - commuting observables . even though this kind of urs allow us to form mental pictures useful to get insights about quantum theory and also provide means for important quantitative predictions , they do not always capture the essence of the principle , as has been pointed out in refs .",
    "accordingly , a variety of alternative formulations have been proposed such as those using higher - order moments  @xcite , or information - theoretic measures of ignorance that give entropic uncertainty inequalities  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the study of urs relies to some extent on the fact that they are useful in several applications of quantum information as well as entanglement detection and quantum cryptography , among many others  @xcite .",
    "the geometric approach to quantum mechanics plays a fundamental role not only in foundational issues but also in applications of quantum information processing  @xcite . in order to contribute within this approach , we provide here a geometric formulation of the uncertainty principle .",

    "purification is a procedure which allows us to associate _ mixed _ quantum states with _ pure _ quantum states .",
    "this concept emerges from the fact that , given a density matrix @xmath1 acting on a hilbert space @xmath2 and associated with a _ mixed _ quantum state , it is always possible to find a _ pure _ quantum state @xmath3 belonging to an _ extended _ hilbert space @xmath4 so that @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the _ partial trace _ over the degrees of freedom of the hilbert space @xmath7 .    in order to see how to purify a mixed quantum state by means of a mathematical procedure",
    "see , for example , refs .  .",
    "in this case , it can be seen that purification is not unique .",
    "it is also important to note that purification is not an abstract concept beyond physical reality .",

    "this quantity is defined as  @xcite : @xmath10 an equivalent definition of @xmath11 can be provided in terms of purifications of the states @xmath1 and @xmath9  @xcite .",

    "then , due to the metric character of wotters distance @xmath54 for pure states , the triangle inequality reads @xmath55 we now show that , when choosing adequately the purifications corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath50 , each term on the left hand - side can be written in terms of the fidelity between the corresponding density matrix and @xmath1 . indeed , for any given purification @xmath51 of @xmath1",

    "thus , we obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote the purifications that maximize the overlaps .",
    "now , due to arccosine is a decreasing function , we have @xmath63 which combined with   gives @xmath64 this completes the proof of the triangle inequality for the angle metric @xmath65 .",
    "now , we use eq .",
    "when @xmath66  and  @xmath67 . here , the operator @xmath68 represents the rank - one projector associated with the @xmath69th outcome of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , for a system with density matrix @xmath1 one has @xmath70 an analogous relation holds for the projector correponding to the @xmath71th outcome of @xmath34 .",

    "inequality   is an ur and it is the natural extension of lpi   for the case of mixed states in a hilbert space of arbitrary dimension . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this result was only formally proved for quantum states belonging to a hilbert space of dimension  2  @xcite .",
    "the extension of lpi for mixed states in arbitrary dimensions is one of the most important results of the present work .",
    "let us start from fidelity - based metrics of the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a _ decreasing _ function for @xmath77 $ ] , with @xmath78 .",
    "now , recalling the link between fidelity and probability given in eq .",
    ", we propose as uncertainty measure for an observable @xmath33 the following quantity @xmath79 notice that indeed this is a reasonable measure of uncertainty as it satisfies , by definition , the following basic properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath80 , 2 .",
    "@xmath81 is decreasing in terms of @xmath82 , that is , uncertainty decreases when one has more certainty about the predictability of @xmath33 , 3 .",
    "@xmath83 if and only if @xmath84 , that is , uncertainty vanishes only when one has certainty about the predictability of @xmath33 , and 4 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath81 is attained at @xmath85 , which leads to the uniform distribution , that is , uncertainty is maximum only when one has complete ignorance about the predictability of @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be two observables with discrete non - degenerate spectra acting on an @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space . consider a quantum system described by a density operator @xmath1 , and an uncertainty measure associated with the observables given in the form of eq .  .",
    "then , the following ur holds : @xmath86 where @xmath87 , being @xmath68 and @xmath88 the rank - one projectors associated with the @xmath69th outcome of @xmath33 and the @xmath71th outcome of @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the triangle inequality fulfilled by   applied to the triplet @xmath68 , @xmath88 , @xmath1 , leads to @xmath89 where we made use of  .",
    "note that this inequality is valid for _ any _ pair of indices @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , one can choose ( separately ) the indices @xmath91 and @xmath92 that correspond to the maximum probabilities @xmath82 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "using   we arrive to @xmath94 the proof concludes by using the fact that @xmath95 and that @xmath96 is decreasing .",
    "we remark that , regardless of the explicit form of the uncertainty measure @xmath97 , our formulation captures the essence of the uncertainty principle , in the sense discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , due to the following reasons :    * the lower bound to the uncertainty - sum is universal , that is , it is state - independent , * when @xmath98 the ur given by eq .",
    "is non - trivial , that is , the uncertainty - sum of the observables is strictly greater than zero , and * when @xmath99 ( complementary observables ) , certainty associated with one observable implies maximum ignorance about the other .        to conclude this work ,",
    "we particularize the ur given by eq .",
    "for the case of the fidelity - based metrics introduced in sec .",
    "[ ssec : f - metrics ] , and we compare the concomitant urs . in order to facilitate the comparison , we include the results previously obtained for the angle metric in addition to the new results obtained for bures and root - infidelity metrics .    * angle metric:[sssec : ametric ] + from eqs .  , and , the corresponding uncertainty measure is  @xmath100  for @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we reobtain inequality  : @xmath102 again we observe that this inequality is the natural extension of lpi   to the case of mixed states belonging to a hilbert space of _ arbitrary dimension_. to the best of our knowledge , this result has been proved _ only _ for 2-dimensional states  @xcite , where the fact that the uncertainty measure @xmath103 is concave in terms of @xmath1 is crucial for the demonstration .",
    "however , that argument is not applicable to the case @xmath104 since the uncertainty measure looses the concavity property .",
    "* bures metric:[sssec : bmetric ] + from eqs .  , and",
    ", the corresponding uncertainty measure is  @xmath105  for @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the following ur holds @xmath106 * root - infidelity metric:[sssec : rimetric ] + from eqs .  , and , the corresponding uncertainty measure is  @xmath107  for @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the following ur holds @xmath108    now , let us compare the three urs  , and   by focusing on the set of values of @xmath82 and @xmath93 allowed in each case . with this purpose ,",
    "we define @xmath109 \\times \\left[\\frac{1}{n},1\\right ] : \\ p_{\\mathcal{b};\\rho } \\leq g_{\\lambda , c}(p_{\\mathcal{a};\\rho } ) \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 ( for angle metric ) , @xmath111 ( for bures metric ) , or @xmath112 ( for root - infidelity metric ) , and @xmath113 with @xmath114 given in table  [ tab : table2 ] ( see app .  [ appendix ] )",
    ".       the quadratic polynomial corresponding to each metric has two roots @xmath115 being @xmath116 always negative .",
