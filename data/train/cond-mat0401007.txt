    "two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) placed in a uniform perpendicular magnetic field exhibit a rich variety of phenomena , such as the integer@xcite and fractional@xcite quantum hall effects .",
    "@xcite another well - studied problem is that of a 2des in a uniform perpendicular magnetic field subjected to a periodic potential . even before the discovery of the quantum hall effects",
    ", hofstadter@xcite showed that in this case , the electronic bands split into a remarkable fractal structure of subbands and gaps , the so - called hofstadter butterfly .",
    "two `` asymptotic '' regimes are usually considered : ( i ) if the magnitude of the periodic potential is very large compared to the cyclotron energy and the zeeman splitting , then one can use lattice models to describe the hopping of electrons between wannier - like states localized at the minima of the periodic potential , whereas ( ii ) if the magnitude of the periodic potential is small compared to the cyclotron energy , the periodic potential lifts the degeneracy of each landau level . in both cases ,",
    "the resulting butterfly structure is a function only of the ratio between the flux @xmath0 of the magnetic field through the unit cell of the periodic lattice , and the elementary magnetic flux @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , if @xmath2 of the first asymptotic case is equal to @xmath3 of the second case , their electronic structures are solutions of the same harper s",
    "equation.@xcite if the periodic potential is comparable to the cyclotron energy , landau level mixing must be taken into account ; although landau levels still split into subbands , the structure is no longer universal , but depends also on the ratio of the periodic potential amplitude and the cyclotron energy.@xcite    experimentally , the case with a small periodic modulation can be realized more easily .",
    "this is because the periodic potential is usually imprinted at some distance from the 2des layer ; as a result , its magnitude in the 2des is considerably attenuated .",
    "the interesting cases to study experimentally also correspond to small values of @xmath2 ( of order unity ) , where the butterfly structure shows a small number of subbands separated by large gaps , and should therefore be easier to identify .",
    "periodic modulations have been created using lithography@xcite and holographic illumination .",
    "@xcite the lattice constants of the resulting square lattices are of order 100  nm . as a result ,",
    "the condition @xmath4 ( for instance ) is satisfied for @xmath5  t. this is a very low value , in the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) regime , not the high-@xmath6 quantum regime .",
    "significant landau level mixing and complications from the fact that the fermi level is inside one of the higher landau levels for such small @xmath6-values make the identification of the hofstadter structure difficult .",
    "recently , a new method for lateral periodic modulation has been developed using a self - organized ordered phase of a diblock copolymer deposited on a gaas / algaas heterostructure.@xcite the polymer spheres create a 2d triangular lattice with a lattice constant of about 39  nm .",
    "the corresponding unit cell area is almost an order of magnitude smaller than those achieved in previous experiments , implying that the condition @xmath4 is now satisfied for very strong magnetic fields , @xmath7  t. at such high magnetic fields the system is in the strong quantum regime , and landau level mixing can be safely ignored . for the experimental 2des electron concentrations ,",
    "the fermi level is in the spin - down lowest landau level.@xcite as a result , this experimental setup appears more promising for the successful observation of the butterfly .",
    "nevertheless , one must take into account the disorder which is present in the system ( without disorder , there is no integer quantum hall effect ",
    "iqhe  to begin with ) .",
    "if the disorder is very small compared to the periodic potential amplitude , one expects that the subbands of the hofstadter structure are `` smeared '' on a scale @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the scattering time , and @xmath10 as disorder becomes vanishingly small .",
    "as a result , the larger gaps in the hofstadter structure should remain open at the positions predicted in the absence of disorder , and one expects a series of minima in the longitudinal conductivity as the fermi level traverses such gaps .",
    "the experiment indeed shows a very non - trivial modification of the longitudinal resistivity , with many peaks and valleys appearing in what is ( in the absence of the periodic modulation ) a smooth lorentz - like peak.@xcite however , the position of the minima in @xmath11 do not track the positions of the main gaps in the corresponding hofstadter butterfly structure .",
    "instead , the data suggests that in this experimental setup , disorder is not small , but rather large compared to the estimated amplitude of the periodic potential .",
    "this is not a consequence of poor samples , since these 2des have high mobilities .",
    "it is due to the fact that the periodic modulation is considerably attenuated in the 2des , leading to a small energy scale for the hofstadter butterfly spectrum as compared to @xmath8 . as a result ,",
    "the hofstadter structure predicted in the absence of disorder is of little use for interpreting the experimental data .",
    "one might expect that in this case the periodic potential should have basically no effect on the disorder - broadened landau level .",
    "this is indeed true for the strongly localized states at the top and bottom of the landau level .",
    "however , states in the center of the landau level extend over many unit cells of the periodic potential , and , as we demonstrate in the following , are non - trivially modified by its presence .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate numerically the behavior of a 2des subject to a perpendicular magnetic field , a periodic potential and a disorder potential , under conditions applicable to the experimental system .",
    "the effective electron mass in gaas is @xmath12 while the magnetic fields of interest are on the order of 10  t. under these conditions , the cyclotron energy @xmath13 , of the order of 200  k , is the largest energy scale in the problem .",
    "the zeeman energy @xmath14 for these fields is roughly 3  k , but electron interaction effects lead to a considerable enhancement of the spin splitting between the ( spin polarized ) landau levels , which has been measured to be 20  k.@xcite the amplitude of the periodic potential s largest fourier components is estimated to be of the order of 1  k , and the scattering rate from the known zero field mobility is estimated to be @xmath15  k. @xcite as a result of this ordering of energy scales , we neglect landau level inter - mixing and study non - perturbatively the combined effects of a periodic and a large smooth disorder potential on the electronic structure of the lowest landau level . previously , the effects of small disorder on a hofstadter butterfly have been perturbatively investigated using the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) , @xcite and the combined effect of white - noise disorder and periodic modulation on hall resistance was studied following the scaling theory of iqhe.@xcite our results reveal details of the electronic structure not investigated previously .",
    "the two - lead geometry we consider is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : the finite 2des is assumed to have periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath16-direction ( along which the hall currents flow ) , and is connected to metallic leads at the @xmath17 and @xmath18 edges . in particular , in this paper we study the effects of the periodic potential on the extended states carrying longitudinal currents between the two leads , and identify a number of interesting properties , in qualitative agreement with simple arguments provided by a semi - classical picture .",
    "our main conclusion is that while the beautiful hofstadter structure is destroyed by large disorder , the system still exhibits very interesting and non - trivial physics .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we briefly review the computation of the hofstadter structure for a small - amplitude periodic potential . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we describe the type of disorder potentials considered .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] describes the numerical methods used to analyze the spectrum and the nature of the electronic states , with both semi - classical and fully quantum - mechanical formalisms .",
    "results are presented in section  [ sec5 ] , while section  [ sec6 ] contains discussions and a summary of our conclusions .",
    "to clarify our notation , we briefly review the problem of a free electron of charge @xmath20 moving in a 2d plane ( from now on , the @xmath21-plane , of dimension @xmath22 ) in a magnetic field @xmath23 perpendicular to the plane , as described by @xmath24 in the landau gauge @xmath25 , the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation @xmath26 are : @xmath27 with eigenenergies @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the magnetic length , @xmath30 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath31 are the hermite polynomials and @xmath32 , respectively @xmath33 are the eigenspinors of @xmath34 : @xmath35 .",
    "the degeneracy of a landau level is given by the number of distinct @xmath36 values allowed .",
    "imposing cyclic boundary conditions in the @xmath16-direction , we find @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an integer .",
    "the allowed values for @xmath38 are found from the condition that the electron wave - functions , which are centered at positions @xmath39 [ see eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) ] are within the boundary along the @xmath40-axis , i. e. @xmath41 .",
    "it follows that the degeneracy of each landau level is @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "consider now the addition of a periodic potential , with a lattice defined by two non - collinear vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 , such that @xmath46 for any @xmath47 .",
    "the periodic potential has non - vanishing fourier components only at the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are integers .",
    "thus : @xmath51 further , since @xmath52 is real , it follows that @xmath53 .    in the absence of landau level mixing , the hofstadter spectrum for both square@xcite @xmath54,\\ ] ] and triangular@xcite @xmath55 @xmath56\\ ] ] periodic potentials , with nonzero fourier components only for _ the shortest reciprocal lattice vectors _ , have been studied extensively in the literature.@xcite the parameter defining the spectrum is the ratio between the flux @xmath57 of the magnetic field through a unit cell and the elementary flux @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are mutually prime integers ,",
    "the original landau level is split into @xmath61 sub - bands .",
    "we would like to emphasize a qualitative difference between the two types of potentials : the square potential in eq .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) is particle - hole symmetric , since @xmath62 . as a result ,",
    "the sign of its amplitude is irrelevant . on the other hand",
    ", the triangular potential does not have this symmetry . with the sign chosen in eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) and @xmath63 , @xmath64 has deep local minima at the sites of the triangular lattice , whereas the maxima are relatively flat and located on a ( displaced ) honeycomb lattice . as a result , the sign of @xmath64 is highly relevant .",
    "the second fact that must be mentioned is that the choice made in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) is rather simple , since it aligns the periodic potential with the edges of the sample in a very specific way . in general",
    ", however , one could consider the case where the periodic lattice is rotated by some finite angle with respect to the sample edges ; study of such cases will be discussed in future work .",
    "finally , it may seem that this choice of periodic potentials is very restrictive also because only the shortest lattice vectors have been kept in the fourier expansion .",
    "in fact , the methods we employ can be directly used for potentials with more fourier components , but their inclusion leads to no new physics .",
    "real samples always have disorder .",
    "the current consensus is that high - quality gaas / algaas samples exhibit a slowly varying , smooth disorder potential . in a semi - classical picture ,",
    "the allowed electron trajectories in the presence of such disorder follow its equipotential lines.@xcite closed trajectories imply localized electron states , while extended trajectories connecting opposite edges of the sample are essential for current transport through the sample ( for more details , see sec .",
    "[ classical ] ) .    in typical experimental setups,@xcite dopant si impurities with a concentration of @xmath65  @xmath66",
    "are introduced in a thin layer of 6  nm in thickness , located 20  nm above the gaas / algaas interface .",
    "typically , up to 10% of the si atoms are ionized .",
    "a small fraction of the ionized electrons migrate to the gaas / algaas interface where they form the 2d electron gas .",
    "the electrostatic potential created by the ionized impurities left behind is the major source of disorder in the 2des layer . on the length - scale",
    "we are interested in , there are @xmath67 to @xmath68 such ionized si impurities per @xmath69 .",
    "the resulting disorder potential must be viewed as a collective effect of the density fluctuation of the ionized impurities@xcite rather than a simple summation of the coulomb potential of a few impurities .",
    "the electrostatic potential from si impurities is compensated and partially screened by other mobile negative charges in the system such as , for example , the surface screening effect by mirror charges considered by nixon and davies.@xcite an exact treatment of this problem is difficult , since one should consider the spatial correlation of the ionized impurities .",
    "@xcite one model used to describe such disorder consists of randomly placed gaussian scatterers.@xcite this model captures the main feature of a smooth disorder potential and supports classical trajectories on equipotential contours , but it has no natural energy / length scales associated with it . as a result , here we choose to also investigate a different model of the disorder , which incorporates the smooth character of the coulomb potential in real space .",
    "we generate a realization of the disorder potential in the following way : positive and negative charges , corresponding to a total concentration of @xmath70 are randomly distributed within a volume @xmath71\\times[-l_y/2,l_y/2]\\times[20\\mbox{nm}+d,26\\mbox{nm}+d]$ ] above the electron gas which is located in the @xmath72 plane . here , we choose @xmath73  nm as an extra spacer since the electronic wave - functions are centered about 3 - 5  nm below the gaas / algaas interface . since we are not simulating single impurities but density fluctuations , these charges are not required to be elementary charges .",
    "instead , we use a uniform distribution in the range @xmath74 $ ] for convenience ( a gaussian distribution would also be a valid choice ) , and sum up all coulomb potentials from these charges , using the static dielectric constant in gaas @xmath75.@xcite the resulting disorder potential has energy and length scales characteristic of the real samples .",
    "typical contours for such potentials are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] .    in an infinite system , in the quantum hall regime",
    ", the existence of quantum hall steps implies the existence of critical energies at which the localization length diverges.@xcite this is the quantum analog of the two dimensional percolation problem in a smooth random landscape , for which there exists a single critical energy.@xcite in the case of potentials with electron - hole symmetry @xmath76 , the critical energy lies in the middle of the band ( @xmath77 ) , leading to percolating path at half filling . for a finite mesoscopic sample , however ,",
    "not only does the percolating path ( critical energy ) @xmath78 deviate from this value , but in samples without a periodic boundary condition one need not have a percolating path traversing the system in the desired direction .",
    "this arises from the fluctuations near the edge of a mesoscopic system with free boundary conditions .",
    "we circumvent such a possibility by adding an extra smooth potential @xmath79 to the impurity - induced disorder potential @xmath80 , such that the total potential @xmath81 is zero on the opposite edges @xmath82 of the sample where the metallic leads are attached .",
    "the supplementary contribution @xmath79 can be thought of as simulating the effect of the leads on the disorder potential , since the metallic leads hold the potential on each edge constant by accumulating extra charges near the interface .",
    "therefore , physically we expect that the extra potential @xmath83 decays exponentially over the screening length @xmath84 inside the sample .",
    "this implies : @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath84 is taken to be @xmath87  nm in our calculation .    .",
    "for both coulomb and gaussian model , @xmath88 is averaged over 116 disorder realizations .",
    "the relation between @xmath89 and @xmath52 and relevant parameters are discussed in the text .",
    "the standard deviation , @xmath90 for the coulomb model is @xmath91ev@xmath92 , and @xmath93ev@xmath92 for the gaussian model . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1.5 ] , we plot the average of fourier transform of the magnitude of the random potential @xmath94 versus @xmath95 for the coulomb model and the gaussian model .",
    "the gaussian model is generated by adding 100 randomly placed gaussian scatterers on an area of @xmath96 , each contributing @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is uniformly distributed in @xmath99 $ ]  mev , and @xmath100 is uniformly distributed in @xmath101 $ ]  @xmath102 m .",
    "@xmath103 is related to @xmath52 by @xmath104 , where the summation is over all the wavevectors involved in the fast fourier transformation .",

    "@xmath106  mev . as can be seen",
    ", @xmath89 of both models are decreasing functions of @xmath61 .",
    "the trends of decay are exponential at large @xmath61 . at small @xmath61 , the two models behave differently . despite the difference ,",
    "both models lead to the same qualitative results , although , as expected , minor quantitative differences are present .",
    "this shows that the physics we uncover is independent of the particular type of slowly - varying disorder potential considered , and therefore should be relevant for the real samples .",
    "in this section we discuss the numerical methods we use , including derivations of some relevant formulas .",
    "as already stated , we focus on the case where the amplitudes of the periodic and disorder potentials are very small compared to the cyclotron energy and the zeeman splitting , and therefore inter - level mixing is ignored .",
    "the semi - classical approach is valid@xcite for the integer quantum hall effect in the presence of a slowly varying , smooth disorder potential and large magnetic fields ( such as we consider ) , so that the magnetic length @xmath107 which determines the spatial extent of the electron wave - functions is much smaller than the length scale of variation of the smooth disorder potential , @xmath108 .",
    "then , semi - classically the electron moves along the equipotential contours of the disorder potential @xmath52 , in the direction parallel to @xmath109 .",
    "since the kinetic energy is quenched in the lowest landau level , the total energy of the electron simply equals the value of the disorder potential on the equipotential line on which its trajectory is located . as a result",
    ", the density of states in the semi - classical approach is directly given by the probability distribution for the disorder potential , which can be calculated by randomly sampling the potential energy and plotting a histogram of the obtained values.@xcite    in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we compare the results obtained within this semi - classical approach with fully quantum mechanical results .",
    "as expected , the agreement is good if only the disorder potential is present .",
    "however , if the periodic modulation is also included , the lattice constant @xmath110 provides a new length - scale which is comparable to the magnetic length @xmath107 , and the semi - classical picture breaks down .",
    "quantum mechanical calculations are absolutely necessary to quantitatively treat this case .      as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , for a finite sample of size @xmath111 at a given magnetic field @xmath6 , the degeneracy of the unperturbed landau level is @xmath112 .",
    "since the disorder varies very slowly , we need to consider systems with @xmath113 to properly account for its effects . as a result",
    ", the number of states in a landau level can be as large as @xmath67 in our calculations .",
    "storage of the hamiltonian as a dense matrix requires considerable amount of computer memory and its direct diagonalization is prohibitively time - consuming .",

    "we introduce the numerical methods we use to compute densities of states and infer the nature ( localized or extended ) as well as the spatial distribution of the wave - functions , while avoiding direct diagonalization .",

    "we have verified that a grid size of dimension @xmath137 is already large enough to accurately capture the landscape of a @xmath96 sample and the computed quantities have already converged , with larger grids leading to hardly noticeable changes .",
    "this procedure is also justified on a physical basis .",
    "first , the neglected large wave - vector components describe very short - range spatial features , which are probably not very accurately captured by our disorder models to begin with , and which are certainly not believed to influence the basic physics .",
    "secondly , this procedure insures that the actual disorder potential we use is periodic in the @xmath16-direction , since each fourier component retained has this property .",
    "this is consistent with our use of a basis of wave - functions which are periodic along @xmath16 .",

    "this happens throughout the area defined by the equipotentials @xmath287 and @xmath288 of the disorder potential , since the addition of the periodic potential leads new regions in this area to have a total energy @xmath167 .",

    "enhanced delocalization _ on both sides of the critical region as localized wave functions spread out over larger areas , as well as a widening of the critical region itself , in agreement with our numerical results .",
    "this spreading of the wave functions in the presence of the periodic potential can also be characterized by counting , at a given energy @xmath167 , the number of grid points @xmath289 which have a value @xmath290 , where @xmath291 is some threshold value . for sufficiently large @xmath291",

    "we see that the largest values are found at energies just below 0 , where the extended states ( the critical region ) are found for this particular realization of disorder .",
    "because it is a smooth , sharp line , even the most extended trajectory has significant probabilities at only about 10% of the grid sites . for both higher and lower energies",
    ", this number decreases very fast , indicating wave functions localized more and more about maxima or minima of the disorder potential , as expected .",
    "addition of a small periodic potential increases this number substantially , clearly showing the supplementary spreading of the wave functions in the presence of the periodic potential .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows this effect for three types of periodic potential : triangular lattices with @xmath293 and @xmath294 ( upper panel ) , and square lattice in the lower panel .",
    "all three cases show significant enhancement , as compared to the pure disorder case .",
    "in addition , we see that while the square potential gives a fairly symmetrical enhancement , the triangular potential does not , with curves for @xmath295 not overlapping .",
    "this is a consequence of the asymmetric shape of the periodic potential , which has different values for its minima and maxima @xmath296 , as well as different arrangements for the points where minima / maxima appear ( triangular lattice vs. honeycomb lattice ) .",
    "[ fig11 ] clearly shows that @xmath297 favors increased delocalization below the critical energy regime , while @xmath298 favors increased delocalization above it .",
    "the reason for this different response to the two signs of the triangular potential can be nicely explained within the semi - classical framework . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we show the equipotential lines corresponding to filling factors @xmath299 ( well below critical region ) and @xmath300 ( well above the critical region ) for a realization of coulomb disorder ( not shown ) plus a triangular potential with @xmath63 .",
    "areas with energy below the equipotential value are shaded . in this case",
    "we can clearly see that instead of the continuous , smooth trajectory expected for disorder - only cases , there are also extra `` bubbles '' regions connecting the areas between such contours .",
    "since the choice @xmath63 leads to deep minima at @xmath301 with triangular arrangement and relatively flat maxima at @xmath302 with honeycomb arrangement [ see eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) ] , it follows that the triangular ( honeycomb ) `` bubbles '' region appear roughly in the area bounded by the equipotentials @xmath167 and @xmath288 ( respectively , @xmath287 and @xmath167 ) of the pure disorder potential . at low filling factors ,",
    "the pure disorder @xmath167 equipotential is a collection of closed contours surrounding local minima [ see panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for an illustration ] .",
    "it follows that for the choice @xmath303 , the more extended region with triangular `` bubbles '' will be found outside these `` islands '' and will lead to a spread of the wave function over considerably larger areas , as indeed seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . on the other hand , at large filling factors the disorder - only contours are `` islands '' surrounding the maxima of the disorder potential . in this case , contours between @xmath167 and @xmath288 are inside the @xmath167 contour , so the triangular `` bubbles '' region does not help to connect various `` islands '' as before .",
    "the honeycomb `` bubbles '' regions does this , but because @xmath304 the extension of the wave function between `` islands '' is significantly smaller in this case .",
    "in the quantum - mechanical case one expects interference ( due to tunneling ) effects between the small `` bubbles '' regions , and therefore a wave function which is extended over their entire area , as indeed we observe to be the case in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] . in other words ,",
    "one expects that a triangular potential with @xmath63 will lead to considerable increase of the localization length , and respectively widening of the critical energy region , at filling factors below one - half , whereas @xmath294 will favor delocalization at filling factors above one - half , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "this asymmetry is therefore clearly a consequence of the asymmetry of the triangular potential , and is absent for a square potential with only lowest order fourier coefficients , which possesses electron - hole symmetry .",
    "this should have clear implications for the transport properties of the system .",
    "in this study we have investigated the effects of moderate - to - large smooth disorder on the hofstadter butterfly expected for 2des in a perpendicular magnetic field and a pure periodic modulation .",
    "the parameters of our study are chosen so as to be suitable for the interpretation of recent experiments on a two dimensional electron system in gaas / algaas heterostructure with periodic modulation provided by a diblock copolymer , @xcite the experiment shows that ( i ) the longitudinal resistance @xmath305 is still peaked approximately at half filling ; ( ii ) there are many reproducible oscillations in @xmath305 , indicating non - trivial electronic structures in the patterned sample ; ( iii ) the distribution of these oscillatory features is asymmetric , with most of them appearing on the high magnetic fields ( i.e. low filling factors @xmath306 ) side of the peak of @xmath305 ; and ( iv ) the temperature dependence of @xmath305 indicates that the asymmetric off - peak resistance is thermally excited , whereas the central @xmath305 peak ( close to half filling ) has metallic behavior .    these observations can not be explained on the basis of the hofstadter structure.@xcite this is not surprising , since one expects that large disorder will modify this structure considerably .",
    "effects of small disorder on the hofstadter butterfly had been investigated previously using scba,@xcite but this basically perturbational approach is not appropriate for the case of moderate - to - large smooth disorder .",
    "instead , we identify and use a number of techniques which give the exact solution ( if electron - electron interactions , as well as inelastic scattering are neglected ) while avoiding brute force numerical diagonalizations .",
    "our results demonstrate that while the hofstadter butterfly is destroyed by large disorder , the effects of the periodic potential are non - trivial for states near the critical regime .",
    "firstly , they lead to a significant increase in localization lengths of the localized states at mesoscopic ( @xmath307 ) length scale and induce an effective widening of the critical regime near the critical regime .",
    "this is achieved through a spreading of the electron wave - function on the flat regions of the slowly varying disorder potential , where their behavior is dominated by the periodic modulation .",
    "this regime shows an interesting transition between the pure disorder and the pure periodic potential cases . in the case of pure disorder ,",
    "the semi - classical approach tells us that at finite filling factors , some areas of the sample are fully occupied by electrons with the maximum possible density of @xmath308 ( these are the areas where the disorder potential has minima ) whereas other areas are fully devoid of electrons ( areas where the potential has maxima ) and the boundary between such regions is very sharp . on the other hand , for a pure periodic modulation all wave functions have translational invariance with the proper symmetry , and therefore electron densities are uniform over the entire sample ( up to small periodic modulations inside each unit cell ) .",
    "when both types of potential are present , with disorder being dominant , our results show _ three _ types of areas .",
    "there are regions which are fully occupied and regions which are completely devoid of electrons , as in the case of pure disorder .",
    "however , the periodic potential leads to a widening of the boundary between the two , where the wave functions interact with several oscillations of the periodic modulation and therefore have some partial local filling . as the critical regime containing wave functions percolating throughout the sample",
    "is approached , this spreading of the wave function becomes dominant in establishing the transport properties of the system .    an equivalent way to say",
    "this is that the main effect of the periodic potential is to provide bridging between the fully - occupied electron `` puddles '' created by the disorder potential .",
    "since the connecting areas are relatively flat , the local wave functions respond to the local periodic potential , and therefore locally have a hofstadter - butterfly like structure .",
    "if the partial filling factor in such a region is inside the gap of the local hofstadter butterfly structure , one expects no transport through this local area .",
    "this should result in a dip in the longitudinal transport , since in such cases the periodic potential will not transport electrons from one `` puddle '' to another one .",
    "by contrast , if the local filling factor in such a region is inside a subband of a local hofstadter structure , this area will establish a link between different `` puddles '' and thus help enhance the transport through the sample .",
    "transport in this regime should show strong thermal activated behavior , in contrast to metallic transport in the critical regime where the wave functions connect opposite edges of the sample .    as a result ,",
    "one expects a series of local minima and maxima in the longitudinal resistivity on either side of the central peak induced by the extended states ( critical regime ) .",
    "furthermore , for an asymmetric triangular potential , this response should be strongly asymmetric , with the effect most visible on one side of the central peak .",
    "( one must keep in mind that since tunneling leads to exponential dependencies , even small differences in the extent of the wave functions can have rather large effects on @xmath11 ) .",
    "such an asymmetry should also be present in longitudinal conductance of finite but low temperature , e. g. in the hopping regime which is sensitively dependent on the nature of the localized wavefunctions , as is indeed seen experimentally.@xcite    to summarize , our qualitative explanation for the various experimental features are as follows :    \\(i ) the @xmath305 peak is roughly at the center of the band because the weak periodic potential can not establish a hofstadter - like structure over the whole band .",
    "instead , low and high @xmath239 states are strongly localized and do not transport longitudinal currents .",
    "\\(ii ) new extended states induced by the periodic potential are responsible for the reproducible peaks and valleys appearing in @xmath305 .",
    "\\(iii ) the periodic potential also leads to the expansion of localized wave functions , which contribute to the thermally activated conduction at lower filling factors .",
    "the detailed structure of the wave functions gives rise to the oscillations of the off - peak @xmath305 , similar to conductance fluctuations.@xcite finally ,    \\(iv ) the asymmetry in @xmath305 is a manifestation of the asymmetry of the triangular potential , which has a stronger effect at low filling factors than at high filling factors for @xmath63 .",
    "we predict that this asymmetry should be absent for a symmetric square periodic potential .",
    "the weak point in our calculation is that we are unable to accurately model the potential in the real samples , because various screening effects have not been properly taken into account .",
    "also , we have no quantitative information about the magnitude of the periodic potential in the 2des layer , because of the additional strain@xcite contribution induced by the periodic decoration . as a result",
    ", we only claim qualitative agreement with the experiment , although our investigations show the same type of behavior for various types of disorder potentials and various ( small - to - moderate ) strengths of the periodic potential .",
    "the most direct check of this work would be an experimental demonstration that thermally activated conduction appears symmetrically on both sides of the @xmath305 peak for a periodic potential with square symmetry and primarily lowest fourier coefficients .",
    "limited computer resources restrict our calculations to samples no larger than @xmath309m@xmath310 m , while the sample used in experiment has a size of @xmath311m@xmath312 m . from a theoretical point of view , it is interesting to ask what is the thermodynamic limit . for pure disorder , it is believed that in this limit the typical size of wavefunction diverges at a single critical energy . since we can not pursue size - dependent analysis for samples larger than @xmath309m@xmath310 m , we do not know whether the small periodic potential will lead to a finite size critical regime in the thermodynamic limit , although this seems likely . from an experimental point of view",
    ", the interesting question is whether the hofstadter structure can be observed at all .",
    "our studies suggest that this may be possible for small mesoscopic samples , where the slowly - varying disorder has less effect . alternatively",
    ", one must find a way to boost the strength of the periodic modulations inside the 2des .",

    "this can be understood in the spirit of the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , since it ensures constructive interference of the wave function around the contour .",
    "except for the most localized states , found at the bottom and the top of the band , all other localized states are such that they enclose large numbers of magnetic fluxes . imposing the exact quantization condition ( which is numerically time consuming ) leads to a negligible change in the value of the allowed equipotential value with respect to a randomly chosen value . since such small changes do not influence the shape of the density of states , we ignore imposing this quantization condition in obtaining the semi - classical densities of states ."
