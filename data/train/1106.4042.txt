    "nucleus collisions :    open charm and beauty hadrons should be sensitive to the energy density , through the mechanism of in - medium energy loss of heavy quarks ;    quarkonium states should be sensitive to the initial temperature of the system , through their dissociation due to colour screening .    the first alice results on charmonium production in pb ",
    "pb collisions are described in  @xcite . in this report",
    "we present first measurements of the medium - induced suppression of high transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) heavy - flavour hadrons .",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath5 of particle @xmath4 distributions is well - established as a sensitive observable for the study of the interaction of hard partons with the medium .",
    "this factor is defined as the ratio of the @xmath4 spectrum measured in nucleus ",
    "nucleus ( aa ) to that expected on the basis of the proton  proton spectrum scaled by the number @xmath6 of binary nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions in the nucleus ",
    "nucleus collision : @xmath7 where the aa spectrum corresponds to a given collision - centrality class and @xmath8 is the average nuclear overlap function resulting for that centrality class from the glauber model of the collisions geometry  @xcite .",
    "a strong suppression in the @xmath9 of charged particles was observed in pb ",
    "pb collisions at the lhc  @xcite . due to the qcd nature of parton energy loss , quarks are predicted to lose less energy than gluons ( that have a higher colour charge ) and , in addition , the ` dead - cone effect ' and other mechanisms are expected to reduce the energy loss of massive quarks with respect to light partons ( light - flavour quarks and gluons )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should observe a pattern of gradually decreasing @xmath9 suppression when going from the mostly gluon - originated light - flavour hadrons ( e.g. pions ) to d and to b mesons  @xcite : @xmath10 .",
    "the measurement and comparison of these different medium probes provide a unique test of the colour - charge and mass dependence of parton energy loss .",
    "the alice experiment was designed to detect heavy - flavour hadrons over a wide phase - space coverage and in various decay channels , as we will discuss in section  [ sec : hf ] .",
    "the production of heavy - flavour probes was measured in proton  proton collisions at @xmath11 and compared to perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions .",
    "these results , reported in section  [ sec : pp ] , provide a well - defined , calibrated , reference for @xmath9 measurements .",
    "the reference at the pb ",
    "pb @xmath12 energy is obtained by a pqcd - driven scaling ( section  [ sec : scaling ] ) .",
    "pb analysis results and the nuclear modification factors of @xmath13 and @xmath14 mesons , and of electrons and muons from heavy - flavour decays are presented in section  [ sec : pbpb ] .",
    "more details on these analyses can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the heavy - flavour detection capability of the alice detector , described in detail in  @xcite , is mainly provided by :    tracking system ; the silicon inner tracking system ( its ) and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) embedded in a magnetic field of @xmath15  t , allow track reconstruction in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath16 with a momentum resolution better than 4% for @xmath17 and a transverse impact parameter , is defined as the distance of closest approach of the track to the interaction vertex , in the plane transverse to the beam direction . ]",

    "@xmath37 is also under study .",
    "the results that we present are obtained from data recorded with minimum - bias trigger selections in pp and pb  pb collisions .",
    "these selections were defined by the presence of signals in either of two scintillator hodoscopes , the v0 detectors , positioned in the forward and backward regions of the experiment , or in the silicon pixel barrel detector , in coincidence with the signals of two beam pick - up counters on both sides of the interaction region . for muon analyses in pp collisions , a second selection requests , in addition to the minimum - bias condition , a muon trigger signal ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the results presented correspond to about 100180 million ( depending on the analysis ) pp minimum - bias triggers and about 17 million pb ",
    "pb minimum - bias triggers . for pp collisions ,",
    "the heavy flavour production cross sections are normalized relative to the minimum - bias trigger cross section , which is derived using a van - der - meer scan technique .",
    "pb collision - centrality classes are defined in terms of percentiles of the distribution of the sum of amplitudes in the v0 scintillator detectors .",
    "the detection strategy for d mesons at central rapidity is based , for both pp and pb  pb collisions , on the selection of displaced - vertex topologies , i.e. separation of tracks from the secondary vertex from those from the primary vertex , large decay length ( normalized to its estimated uncertainty ) , and good alignment between the reconstructed d meson momentum and flight - line .",
    "the identification of the charged kaon in the tpc and tof detectors helps to further reduce the background at low @xmath4 .",
    "an invariant - mass analysis is then used to extract the raw signal yield , to be then corrected for detector acceptance and for pid , selection and reconstruction efficiency , evaluated from a detailed detector simulation .",
    "the contamination of d mesons from b meson decays is estimated to be of about 15% , using the beauty production cross section predicted by the fonll ( fixed - order next - to - leading log ) calculation  @xcite and the detector simulation , and it is subtracted from the measured raw @xmath4 spectrum , before applying the efficiency corrections .",

    "the components of the cocktail are electrons from light - flavour hadron decays ( mainly @xmath43 dalitz decays , in addition to @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 decays ) , and @xmath48 conversions in the beam pipe and innermost pixel layer .",

    "heavy flavour production at forward rapidity is measured using the single - muon @xmath4 distribution .",
    "the extraction of the heavy - flavour contribution from the single muon spectra requires the subtraction of three main sources of background : muons from the decay - in - flight of light hadrons ( decay muons ) ; muons from the decay of hadrons produced in the interaction with the front absorber ( secondary muons ) ; hadrons that punch through the front absorber .",
    "the last contribution , about 20% for @xmath50 , can be efficiently rejected by requiring the matching of the reconstructed tracks with the tracks in the trigger system . due to the lower mass of the parent particles ,",
    "the light - hadron decay muons have a softer transverse momentum than the heavy - flavour muons , and dominate the low-@xmath4 region . in the pp analysis this background is subtracted using simulations , as detailed in  @xcite . the charm and beauty decay muon cross section @xmath51 in the range @xmath42 is presented in fig .  [",

    "the reference pp cross sections used for the determination of the nuclear modification factors were obtained by applying a @xmath54-scaling  @xcite to the cross sections measured at @xmath11 .",
    "the scaling factors for each of the three observables ( d mesons , muons , electrons ) were defined as the ratios of the cross sections from the fonll pqcd calculation at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the assumption that was made is that the following quantities do not vary with @xmath54 : a ) the pqcd scale values ( factorization and renormalization scales ) and b ) the c and b quark masses used in the calculation .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty on the scaling factor was evaluated by considering the envelope of the scaling factors resulting from different values of the scales and heavy quark masses .",
    "this uncertainty is similar for d mesons and for heavy - flavour decay leptons at the two rapidities and it ranges from 25% at @xmath57 to less that 10% above @xmath58  @xcite .    for d mesons ,",
