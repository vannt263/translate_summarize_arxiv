    "extragalactic astronomy has traditionally focused on the regions of extreme cosmic over - density that we know as galaxies . only in recent years",
    "has the realization emerged that galaxies do not dominate the universal baryon budget but are merely the brightest pearls of an underlying cosmic web .",
    "filamentary components extending between the massive galaxies are a conspicuous prediction of high resolution numerical models of structure formation ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such calculations suggest that in the current epoch , cosmic baryons are almost equally distributed by mass amongst three components : ( 1 ) galactic concentrations , ( 2 ) a warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) and ( 3 ) a diffuse intergalactic medium .",
    "these three components are each coupled to a decreasing range of baryonic over - density : @xmath6 , 13.5 , and @xmath7 1 and are probed by qso absorption lines with specific ranges of neutral column density : @xmath8 , 1418 , and @xmath7 14 .",
    "the neutral fraction is thought to decrease with decreasing column density from about 100% for log(n@xmath919.5 to about 1% at log(n@xmath3 )  =  17 , to less than 0.1% at log(n@xmath3 )  =  13 .",
    "although a very wide range of physical conditions can be found within galaxies , the whim is thought to be a condensed shock - heated phase with temperature in the range 10@xmath1010@xmath11  k , while the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) is predominantly photo - ionized with temperature near 10@xmath12  k. a complicating factor to this simple picture is the growing suspicion that the gas accretion process , traced by the @xmath13  =  1418 systems , may well occur in two rather different regimes ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "low to moderate mass galaxies ( m@xmath14m@xmath15 ) may experience primarily `` cold - mode '' accretion ( t  @xmath16  10@xmath17  k ) along filaments , while only more massive systems may be dominated by the more isotropic `` hot - mode '' accretion ( t  @xmath16  10@xmath18  k ) , which until recently was thought to be universal ( eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strongest observational constraints on this picture come from the statistics of the qso absorption lines .",
    "enough of such qso spectra have been obtained to allow good statistical determinations to be made of the rate of occurrence of intervening absorbers as function of their column density . by binning such data in red - shift intervals ,",
    "it has even been possible to gauge the cosmic evolution of intervening absorbers @xcite .",
    "inter - galactic space has apparently become continuously tidier by about an order of magnitude from red - shifts of several down to zero ; with a decreasing cross - section of high column absorbers . at the current epoch",
    "we can now confidently predict that in going down from hi column densities of 10@xmath0 @xmath1 ( which define the current `` edges '' of well - studied nearby galaxies in hi emission ) to 10@xmath2 @xmath1 , the surface area will increase by a factor of 30 .",
    "the critical observational challenge is crossing the `` hi desert '' , the range of log(n@xmath3 ) from about 19.5 down to 18 , over which photo - ionization by the intergalactic radiation field produces an exponential decline in the neutral fraction from essentially unity down to a few percent ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "nature is kinder again to the hi observer below log(n@xmath3 )  =  18 , where the neutral fraction decreases only very slowly with log(n@xmath3 ) .",
    "the baryonic mass traced by this gas ( with a 1% or less neutral fraction ) is expected to be comparable to that within the galaxies , as noted above .",
    "but how are these low n@xmath3 systems distributed and what are their kinematics ? these are questions which can not be addressed with the qso absorption line data .",
    "the areal density of suitable background sources is far too low to allow `` imaging '' of the intervening low column density systems in absorption .",
    "direct detection of the free - free continuum or recombination line emission from the ionized gas has also proven well beyond the capabilities of current x - ray and optical instrumentation ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the expected h@xmath19 emission measure is only about em  =  5@xmath20 @xmath21 pc .",
    "the very best current h@xmath19 imaging results reach down to about em  =  0.1 @xmath21 pc , which is still orders of magnitude removed from what would be needed .",
    "although conventional imaging in the 21 cm emission line of neutral hydrogen has not typically reached column densities below about 10@xmath0 @xmath1 , this is not a fundamental limitation .",
    "long integrations with an ( almost-)filled aperture can achieve the required brightness sensitivity to permit direct imaging of the small neutral fraction within the cosmic web filaments between galaxies . the first detection of such diffuse filaments in the extended environment of m31 has just been made by @xcite .",
    "this was accomplished by utilizing total power measurements made with the fourteen 25 m dishes of the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .",
    "a series of drift - scan observations were used to obtain nyquist - sampled hi imaging of a region 60@xmath2230 degrees region in extent , centered approximately on the position of m31 .",
    "although the angular resolution is low ( effective beam of 49  arcmin , corresponding to 11  kpc at the m31 distance ) the column density sensitivity is very high ( 4@xmath23 @xmath1 rms over 17  km  s@xmath24 ) .",
    "a diffuse filament is detected connecting the systemic velocities of m31 to m33 ( at a projected separation of 200 kpc ) and also extending away from m31 in the anti - m33 direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m31m33 ] .",
    "this diffuse filament appears to be fueling denser gaseous streams and filaments in the outskirts of both galaxies .",
    "peak neutral column densities within the filament only amount to some 3@xmath25 @xmath1 .",
    "the extremely diffuse nature of the hi has been confirmed by pointed green bank telescope ( gbt ) observations of a local peak in the filament which yields the same low peak column density ( @xmath26 @xmath1 ) , despite a telescope beam area that is 25 times smaller .",
    "the interaction zone of the diffuse filament with m31 has been studied in complimentary surveys : a 6@xmath226 degree field imaged with the gbt @xcite and a 5@xmath222 degree wsrt mosaic of nearly 200 synthesis pointings @xcite .",
    "our three surveys permit calculation of the hi distribution function from hi emission measurements ( rather than qso absorption measurements ) over an unprecedented range in log(n@xmath3 )  =  17.2 to log(n@xmath3 )  =  21.9 as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m31m33 ] .",
    "the n@xmath3 data for the m31 environment were normalized to the average space density of galaxies using the himf of @xcite .",
    "the hi distribution function of these structures agrees very well with that of the low red - shift qso absorption lines which are also plotted in the figure as filled circles with error bars .",
    "the predicted factor of 30 increase in surface covering factor for low n@xmath3 emission has been observationally verified . in so doing ,",
    "it has been possible to provide the first image of a lyman limit absorption system .",
    "the morphology and kinematics are in keeping with the cosmic web hypothesis outlined above , although the region we have currently probed only extends to about the virial radius of m31 .",
    "we have attempted to assess the physical conditions within the m31/m33 filament by extracting and analyzing hi emission spectra of sufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "the wsrt spectrum toward the brightest knot at @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : filspec ] .",
    "the negative values at positive v@xmath28 are a consequence of galactic foreground emission .",
    "a gaussian with 13 km  s@xmath24 dispersion , corresponding to a thermal linewidth of about 17000  k , is overlaid .",
    "this concentration was also observed with a pointed 30 minute on / off integration with the gbt .",
    "the gbt spectrum confirms a moderately narrow line core of similar strength , and also suggests an underlying broader component . in the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : filspec ] we show the spectrum obtained by averaging over a sigificant fraction of the filament , corresponding to a box of 4@xmath223 degree extent in ( ra , dec ) . from the first moment distribution along the filament",
    "@xcite we can estimate the rms contributions of the large - scale velocity gradient and additional smaller - scale line - of - sight velocity structure to the total linewidth to be less than about 20  km  s@xmath24 .",
    "this is much smaller than the observed line - width over the filament , which is well - approximated by a 45  km  s@xmath24 dispersion gaussian , as overlaid in the figure .",
    "this line - width , if thermal in nature , would correspond to a kinetic temperature of 2@xmath4 k.    the broad line - width seen in the bulk of the m31/m33 filament is consistent with the expected kinetic temperature in shock - heated whim filaments .",
    "while it may seem counter - intuitive that neutral hydrogen emission could display such a high kinetic temperature , it must be remembered that the hi may be a trace constituent of a highly ionized plasma . a small fraction of the individual hydrogen ions in such a plasma is continuously undergoing recombination .",
    "the emission line - width must then reflect the kinetic temperature of the parent ion population .",
    "only when the neutral fraction becomes significant , will the emission line - width reflect the kinetic temperature of the atoms .",
    "two complimentary initiatives have just been begun which should lay the groundwork for a comprehensive study of the cosmic web phenomenon and provide strong constraints on cosmological models of galaxy evolution .",
    "the first initiative involves a complete reprocessing and analysis of the recently published hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) of the hi sky between declinations of @xmath2990 and @xmath3020@xmath31 @xcite , together with existing deeper integrations of selected regions ( galaxy groups and clusters ) . while the column density sensitivity of even the nominal survey is quite good ( @xmath32n@xmath334@xmath25 @xmath1 rms over 17  km  s@xmath24 in a 15  arcmin beam , and better by factors of a few in selected regions ) the adopted method of band - pass calibration has resulted in strong negative residuals in the vicinity of bright detected sources .",
    "unfortunately , this type of artifact makes it impossible to detect or even constrain the anticipated faint hi cosmic web filaments within the current hipass products .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hipass ] , where the existing hipass product is contrasted with a very preliminary re - processed version of the same data . although not yet optimized , our improved calibration ( based on iterative signal blanking ) is already revealing diffuse hi filaments that were not previously detected .",
    "further optimization of the calibration algorithm should enable the theoretical n@xmath3 sensitivity to be achieved over the entire @xmath34  sr covered by the hipass survey to yield a new , rhipass , product .",
    "the second initiative involves a novel and extremely sensitive method for detection of faint hi emission features which employs the wsrt to simulate a filled aperture , while retaining the excellent spectral baseline and psf properties of an interferometer .",
    "the method utilizes the fact that 12 of the 14 wsrt 25  m telescopes can be positioned at regular intervals of 144  m on an east - west line . when observing low declination fields at large positive or negative hour angles , it is possible to form a filled aperture in projection of 300@xmath2225  m extent .",
    "although these geometric conditions are only satisfied for a few minutes each day ( for a given pointing center ) , even a single minute of integration already provides a @xmath32n@xmath335@xmath25 @xmath1 rms over 20  km  s@xmath24 in a 35@xmath223  arcmin beam over a 35@xmath2235 arcmin instantaneous field - of - view .",
    "accumulating integration time over a period of a few weeks makes it possible to probe the n@xmath35 @xmath1 regime over large areas of the sky .",
    "test observations using the wsrt in this observing mode have already been carried out in march 2004 .",
    "these tests have verified both the expected high sensitivity and the excellent spectral baseline and psf properties .",
    "the specific observing program that will be undertaken is a deep fully - sampled survey of the galaxy filament joining the local group to the virgo cluster , extending from 8 to 17 hours in ra and from @xmath291 to @xmath3010@xmath31 in dec .",
    "( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : virfil ] ) . our wsrt virgo filament survey ( wvfs )",
    "will probe the extended environment of more than 340 known galaxies covering a wide range of hubble type and local over - density at distances between about 2 and 40 mpc .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : virfil ] that our survey region provides excellent sampling of the virgo over - density , the most substantial concentration of matter in the local universe .",
    "the survey has been designed to reach @xmath32n@xmath332@xmath25 @xmath1 over 20  km  s@xmath24 in the synthesis data , while the total power data which is being acquired simultaneously will reach @xmath32n@xmath331.3@xmath23 @xmath1 for diffuse emission filling the 35  arcmin primary beam .",
    "survey observations are now scheduled to begin in december 2004 .",
    "we expect many clear detections of diffuse hi filaments to emerge from our survey .",
    "we stress again that the sky area covered at log(n@xmath3 )  =  17 is known to be 30 times greater than that currently probed at log(n@xmath3 )  =  19 .",
    "the detected features will be analyzed from the perspective of their role in on - going galaxy evolution as a function of local over - density .",
    "the observed hi linewidth of the detected features should permit a straightforward assessment of the relative importance of `` cold - mode '' versus `` hot - mode '' accretion given the very distinctive line - widths ( @xmath1630  km  s@xmath24 versus @xmath16100  km  s@xmath24 ) .",
    "follow - up observations at higher resolution will be carried out both in hi to study galaxy fueling in detail as well as optically to look for signs of ongoing ( dwarf ) galaxy formation .",
    "detected filaments will also be correlated with the occurrence of background agn , which could serve as probes for absorption measurements in the optical , uv and x - ray bands .",
    "detection of multiple ionization states for various species would permit a determination of both the metalicity and neutral fraction of hydrogen . with even a few of such spot measurements , estimates of the total mass and current accretion rates could be determined .",
    "the first images of lyman limit absorption systems ( lls ) have now been made .",
    "these confirm the expected 30-fold increase in sky covering factor beyond the `` classical '' edges of normal galaxies .",
    "observationally , the lls regime is very challenging , since it requires crossing the `` hi desert '' , the range of log(n@xmath3 ) from about 19.5 down to 18 , over which photo - ionization by the intergalactic radiation field produces an exponential decline in the neutral fraction from essentially unity down to a few percent .",
    "however , the rewards are substantial .",
    "a comparable baryonic mass to that currently residing in galaxies becomes accessible to direct kinematic study .",
    "we can now witness the ongoing formation and evolution of galaxies via accretion along cosmic web filaments .",
    "the first indications from the m31/m33 filament are that much of the detected hi may be associated with a highly ionized plasma of kinetic temperature of about 2@xmath4 k , implying significant shock heating .",
    "only the brightest knot in the filament appears to be about 2@xmath5 k , perhaps indicating ongoing cooling and condensation within the filament .    achieving the necessary log(n@xmath3 )",
    "=  17 sensitivity in hi emission for lls imaging studies requires observations with an ( almost-)filled aperture .",
    "we are currently pursuing two complimentary initiatives to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive study of the cosmic web phenomenon .",
    "in the first we are planning a complete reprocessing of the hipass total power database , optimized for detection of diffuse filamentary structures near bright galaxies . in the second",
    "we are beginning a wide - field synthesis survey of the galaxy filament joining the local group with the virgo cluster . in the latter case",
    ", we are utilizing the regular spacing of the wsrt array telescopes to form a filled aperture in projection of 300@xmath2225  m extent , while retaining the excellent spectral baseline and psf properties of an interferometer . in this way",
    "we hope to provide the strongest possible constraints on cosmological models of galaxy evolution , using existing instrumentation .",
    "much deeper hi imaging with even higher angular resolution will be possible with the planned ska @xcite which should enable resolved cosmic web studies throughout the local universe ."
