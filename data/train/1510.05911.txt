    "minipage=0.82,margin=0pt , center    _ _    misinformation in media and communication creates a situation in which opposing assertions of fact compete for attention .",
    "this problem is exacerbated in modern , digital society , where people increasingly rely on the aggregate ratings from their social circles for news and information .",
    "although much of the information presented on the web is a good resource , its accuracy certainly can not be guaranteed . in order to avoid being fooled by false assertions , it is necessary to separate fact from fiction and to assess the credibility of an information source .",
    "* knowledge graphs*. we represent a _ statement of fact _ in the form of ( , , ) triples , where the and the are entities that have some relationship between them as indicated by the . for example , the _",
    "`` springfield is the capital of illinois '' _ assertion is represented by the triple ( , , ) .",
    "a set of such triples is known as a knowledge base , but can be combined to produce a multi - graph where nodes represent the entities and directed edges represent the predicates .",
    "different predicates can be represented by edge types , resulting in a heterogeneous information network that is often referred to as a _ knowledge graph_. given a knowledge base that is extracted from a large repository of statements , like wikipedia or the web at large , the resulting knowledge graph represents _ some _ of the factual relationships among the entities mentioned in the statements .",
    "if there existed an ultimate knowledge graph which knew everything , then fact checking would be as easy as checking for the presence of an edge in the knowledge graph . in reality , knowledge graphs have limited information and are often plagued with missing or incorrect relations making validation difficult .",
    "although a knowledge graph may be incomplete , we assume that most of the edges in the graph represent true statements of fact . with this assumption , existing fact checking  @xcite and link prediction methods  @xcite would rate a given statement to be true if it exists as an edge in the knowledge graph or if there is a short path linking its subject to its object , and false otherwise .",
    "statistical relational learning models  @xcite can measure the truthfulness by calculating the distance between the entities and predicate in a given statement . however , the limitation of existing models make them unsuitable for fact checking .",
    "link prediction methods , adamic / adar  @xcite and personalized pagerank  @xcite for example , work on untyped graphs and are incapable of capturing the heterogeneity of knowledge graphs ; other heterogeneous link prediction algorithms ,  _",
    "e.g. _ , pathsim  @xcite and pcrw  @xcite , not only need human annotated meta paths but also have strict constraints on the input meta paths .",
    "statistical relational learning models such as rescal  @xcite , ntn  @xcite , transe  @xcite , and other variants  @xcite utilize the type information in knowledge graphs but can not work with unseen predicate types and do not model the complicated interactions among relations explicitly .    in the present work",
    ", we present a discriminative path - based method for fact checking in knowledge graphs that incorporates connectivity , type information , and predicate interactions .",
    "given a statement @xmath0 of the form ( , , ) , for example , ( , , ) , our approach mines discriminative paths that alternatively define the generalized statement ( , , ) and uses the mined rules to evaluate the veracity of statement @xmath0 .    unlike existing models",
    ", the proposed method simulates how experienced human fact - checkers examine a statement : fact - checkers will first attempt to _ understand _ the generalized notion of the statement using prior knowledge , and then validate the specific statement by applying their knowledge .",
    "the statement usually can be generalized by replacing the specific entities by their type - labels . in the present work ,",
    "we show how to understand a statement by inspecting the related discriminative paths retrieved from the knowledge graph . returning to the `` _",
    "_ chicago is the capital of illinois _ _ '' example , a fact checker , as well as our model , will learn to understand what it means for a to be the a . in this trivial example , a fact checker may come to understand that a city is the capital of a state if the state agencies , governor and legislature are located in the city ; from this understanding the fact checker ought to rule that chicago is not the capital of illinois because this statement does not satisfy the fact checker s understanding of what means .",
    "the advantages of this fact checking procedure is in its _ generality _ and _ context - dependency_. just as humans learn unknown words , model generality means the predicate of a statement can be arbitrary and is not required to be presented in the knowledge base .",
    "moreover , once a prior knowledge is learned , it is associated with a certain type of entity pair relation and can be used for different tasks including general question answering or knowledge base completion .",
    "the notion of context - dependency allows the fact checker to discern different definitions of a predicate in different situations .",
    "for example , could define the capitals of us states , colloquialisms such as `` kansas city is the soccer capital of america '' , or historical or time - sensitive predicates such as `` calcutta _ was _ the capital of india '' depending on the context .    when performed computationally ,",
    "the task of discovering interesting relationships between or among entities is known generally as association rule mining .",
    "although there has been some effort to adapt association mining for knowledge graph completion , these methods are not well suited for fact - finding and often resort to finding global rules and synonyms  @xcite rather than generating a robust understanding of the given context dependent predicate  @xcite .    \\ { } and \\{}@xmath1\\{}@xmath2\\ { } are the discriminative paths of \\{}@xmath3\\ { } mined by amie  @xcite and the proposed method respectively . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : city_capital_example ] illustrates three graph fragments from the dbpedia knowledge base  @xcite containing cities and states .",
    "this example demonstrates , via actual results , how the proposed automatic fact checker is able to determine relationships that uniquely define what it means for an entity to be the another entity .",
    "association rule miners  @xcite and link prediction models  @xcite incorrectly indicate that the is most associated with the predicate .",
    "in contrast , our framework , indicated by solid edges , finds the rules that most uniquely define what it means to be the a state . in this example",
    ", our top result indicates that a us state capital is the in which the of entities that have in the are located .",
    "in other words , we find that a us state capital is indeed the city where the state agencies , like the dept . of transportation , or the dept . of health , have their headquarters .    to summarize ,",
    "we show that we can leverage a collection of factual statements for automatic fact checking . based on the principles underlying link prediction , similarity search and network closure , we computationally gauge the truthfulness of an assertion by mining connectivity patterns within a network of factual statements .",
    "our current work focuses on determining the validity of factual assertions from simple , well - formed statements ; the related problems of information extraction  @xcite , claim identification  @xcite , answering compound assertions  @xcite , and others  @xcite are generally built in - support - of or on - top - of this central task .    recent work in general heterogeneous information networks , of which",
    "knowledge graphs are an example , has led to the development of meta path similarity metrics that show excellent results in clustering , classification and recommendation  @xcite .",
    "the state of the art in meta path mining works by counting the path - instances or randomly walking over a constrained set of hand - annotated typed - edges  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this means that a human has to understand the problem domain and write down relevant meta paths before analysis can begin . in this work ,",
    "our focus is on methods that automatically determine the set of path - descriptions called * discriminative paths * that uniquely encapsulate the relationship between two entities in a knowledge graph .",
    "the specific contributions of this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "we developed a fast discriminative path mining algorithm that can discover `` definitions '' of an rdf - style triple , _",
    "i.e. _ , a statement of fact .",
    "the algorithm is able to handle large scale knowledge graphs with millions of nodes and edges . 2 .",
    "we designed a human interpretable fact checking framework that utilizes discriminative paths to predict the truthfulness of a statement .",
    "we modeled fact checking as a link prediction problem and validated our approach on two real world , large scale knowledge graphs , dbpedia  @xcite and semmeddb  @xcite .",
    "the experiments showed that the proposed framework outperforms alternative approaches and has a similar execution time .    in this paper , we incorporate lessons learned from association rule mining and from heterogeneous information network analysis in order to understand the meanings of various relationships , and we use this new framework for fact - checking in knowledge graphs . to describe our approach",

    "we view a knowledge graph to be a special case of a heterogeneous information network ( hin ) where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between entities , and where heterogeneity stems from the fact that nodes and edges have clearly identified type - definitions .",
    "the type of an entity is labeled by some ontology , and the type of an edge is labeled by the predicate label . with the above assumptions ,",
    "we formally define a knowledge graph as follows :    a knowledge graph is a directed multigraph @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the set of entities , @xmath6 is a set of labeled directed edges between 2 entities , @xmath7 represents the predicate label set , and @xmath8 is the ontology of the entities in @xmath9 . the ontology mapping function @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , links an entity vertex to its label set in the ontology .",
    "the predicate mapping function @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , maps an edge to its predicate type .",
    "[ def : knowledge_graph ]    the knowledge graph defined here differs from the standard definition of an hin ; defn .",
    "[ def : knowledge_graph ] dictates that a node may be mapped to multiple types , which is unlike the traditional hin definition in which each node can be mapped to only one type - label  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath16 satisfies @xmath17 for all @xmath11 , then defn .",
    "[ def : knowledge_graph ] degenerates to the standard hin definition .    for example",
    ", the dbpedia knowledge base can be represented as a knowledge graph in which @xmath5 represents entities like , , or ; @xmath6 represents some link between two entities ; @xmath8 represents a classification scheme like the wikipedia category graph with type - labels like and categories for and respectively ; and @xmath7 represents the predicate labels like and for edges .",
    "typed nodes and edges given in the knowledge graph naturally result in an enhanced set of connections called _ meta paths _ that describe how two entities are connected by their type - labels .",
    "given a knowledge graph @xmath4 , a meta path @xmath18 is defined as a directed , typed sequence of vertices and edges @xmath19 in @xmath9 , where @xmath20 denotes the set of ontology labels of vertex @xmath21 , @xmath22 represents the predicate of the directed edge that connects vertex @xmath21 to @xmath23 , and @xmath24 denotes the length of the meta path .",
    "[ def : meta_path ]    if we relax the definition of a meta path in defn .",
    "[ def : meta_path ] in such a way that the edges still carry type - information , but the non - endpoint nodes do not , then the meta path degenerates into an _ anchored predicate path _ anchored by their starting and ending entity - types :    given a @xmath24-length meta path @xmath18 , the anchored predicate path @xmath25 is defined as the corresponding directed , typed sequence of edges with typed - endpoints @xmath26 .",
    "[ def : anchored_predicate_path ]    with the definitions of knowledge graph and anchored predicate path , here we define the _ discriminative path _ of a statement as :    the set of discriminative paths @xmath27 are those anchored predicate paths that alternatively describe the given statement of fact @xmath28 , where the maximum path length is @xmath24.[def : discriminative_path ]    for example , a meta path @xmath29 between two entities and is represented by the following sequence \\ { , } @xmath1 \\ { } @xmath30 \\{}. the corresponding anchored predicate path @xmath25 is @xmath31 @xmath32 , @xmath33 anchored by \\ { , } and \\{}. if @xmath34 holds , that means can be at least partially defined by @xmath25 .",
    "we discuss how to discover these discriminative paths in the next section .",
    "note that in our generalization of hin , the first entity in the meta path is mapped to two type - labels , and could have many more .",
    "entities with many type labels tend to be more prone to label error when using the meta path representation . with this in mind ,",
    "we choose to use the anchored predicate path representation which we find to have better tolerance on errant type labels .",

    "[ sec : experiment ] .    with the definitions above , the goal of this paper can be formally stated as :    given a knowledge graph @xmath9 and a statement of fact @xmath35 , which may be true or untrue , where subject @xmath36 , object @xmath37 .",
    "fact checking is the process of using a learned understanding of the relationship @xmath27 to determine whether the edge @xmath38 is missing in @xmath9 such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "[ def : fact_checking ]    simply put , we view the fact checking problem as a supervised link prediction task and validate a proposed fact statement @xmath41 by determining if that the proposed fact is implied by the data within the knowledge graph .",

    "@xmath42 and @xmath45 can also be human provided if @xmath49 .    unlike traditional link prediction problems which simply identify true edges from all possible edges ,",
    "the fact checking problem is harder because it needs to distinguish true edges @xmath50 from a smaller edge set @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are have the same type , connectivity , etc . as @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "traditional algorithms , which use purely topological features , do not work well in this task because the topology of the network does not sufficiently distinguish between true and false edges .    in this work",
    "we propose a model that automatically discovers discriminative paths in order to perform fact checking .",
    "the resulting discriminative paths define the proposed predicate @xmath43 in terms of its subject @xmath54 and its object @xmath55 by asking two questions : 1 ) does the predicate @xmath43 connect entities that are of the same or similar type as @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( generality ) , and 2 ) do the paths that connect @xmath54 to @xmath55 differ from the paths that connect similarly - typed entities but which are _ not _ connected by @xmath43 ( context - dependent ) ?",
    "the paths that maximize the above questions 1 and 2 are those paths that uniquely define the predicate in terms of its subject and object .",
    "these paths are critical to modelling statements of fact and determining their veracity .",
    "next we will demonstrate how to test the veracity of statements of fact using discriminative path analysis .",

    ", one of the predicate paths @xmath25 that alternatively and uniquely captures this relationship is @xmath31@xmath32,@xmath33 which is anchored by \\ { } and \\{}.    in addition , @xmath59 includes many other discriminative anchored predicate paths of length @xmath60 that connect @xmath61 to @xmath62 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath63 to @xmath64 .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , we illustrate our proposed fact checking system that contains 3 phases : 1 ) extraction , 2 ) selection , and 3 ) validation .",
    "the extraction phase collects anchored predicate paths that alternatively connect the subject and object of a proposed statement of fact . using the extracted paths @xmath65 , the selection phase defines the fact with the most discriminating anchored predicate paths @xmath56 .",
    "the validation phase compares the actual statement of fact , _",
    "i.e. _ , how the subject , predicate and object are actually connected , with a statistical model constructed from the discriminative paths .      unlike existing meta path based models , which require hand annotation  @xcite or exhaustive enumeration  @xcite and are impractical on large - scale systems , we learn the best descriptions automatically .    we propose a fast discriminative path discovery algorithm using a constrained graph traversal process .",
    "the key idea is the assumption that although the number of paths in a knowledge graph is huge , only a small portion are actually helpful for a given task .",
    "furthermore , among the reduced set of helpful meta paths , only a few may be discriminative in the presence of some predicate .    for example",
    ", if ( , , ) is the proposed statement of fact in need of checking , the meta paths we are interested in are only those that start at a and end at a .",
    "so instead of enumerating all possible paths , we collect anchored predicate paths by traversing the graph starting from the given subject - entity and ending at the given object - entity up to a length of @xmath24 .    to find which paths between @xmath66 and @xmath67 are most discriminating we further create positive and negative node - pair sets @xmath42 and @xmath45 and retrieve two anchored predicate path sets @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively using a depth - first multi - graph traversal .",
    "specifically , our dfs - like graph traversal is based on a closure function @xmath70 , which we define as :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is some entity - node and @xmath43 denotes the predicate associated with the closure .",
    "simply put , @xmath73 finds all nodes that can be reached from @xmath72 via predicate @xmath43 or @xmath74 .",
    "then we define a transition function @xmath75 which returns all @xmath76 candidates , _",
    "i.e. _ , all of the next entity - nodes , for a path @xmath77 as    @xmath78    which contains all of the possible next - nodes that can be visited from @xmath73 except those that have already been visited . using the closure function @xmath73 and transition function @xmath79",
    ", we retrieve the path set @xmath80 with path length @xmath81 by @xmath82 , s.t .",
    "@xmath83    unlike traditional graph traversal algorithms that follow the edge direction , our implementation records and follows both directions of each visited edge if possible . in this way",
    ", the algorithm actually discovers paths such as \\ { } @xmath1 \\ { } @xmath30 \\ { } , which is technically a three node subgraph rather than a path by traditional definitions .    at this point",
    ", our framework will have gathered several anchored predicate paths , some of which may be helpful while others may be unhelpful or spurious .",
    "next , we calculate the importance of each extracted anchored predicate path for inclusion into a final regression model .",
    "although existing heterogeneous information network analysis methods usually utilize meta paths , in this work we use anchored predicate paths as the feature set . as introduced before , the presence of entity types in meta paths may sometimes be redundant and can typically be inferred by the predicate if there is no ambiguity .",
    "for example in the dblp network  @xcite , @xmath84 always connects a with an , and always connects two s. in such cases , meta paths can be converted into predicate path without ambiguity .    in more complex knowledge graphs , such as dbpedia  @xcite and semmeddb  @xcite ,",
    "an entity can have multiple type - labels .",
    "the labels of the same types of entities may not always be consistent due to mislabelling or different interpretations .",
    "an example would be the type labels of and , which are the capitals of massachusetts and california respectively .",
    "the type - labels of is \\ { , , } , whereas the type - labels of are \\ { , } .",
    "because the type labels of do not exactly match the type - labels of , then a meta path model would treat these paths differently , resulting in many highly overlapping , but not exactly matching , paths .",
    "we use the jaccard coefficient  @xcite to measure the similarity of entity - label sets and use this score to reduce redundant meta paths when possible : @xmath85    we combine two meta paths \\{}@xmath86\\ { } and \\{}@xmath86\\ { } if @xmath87 and @xmath88 are larger or equal to a threshold . in practice , we set the threshold to @xmath89 for all non - endpoint entities , which means we ignore the entity - type information in meta paths ; for meta path endpoints we set the threshold as @xmath90",
    ". ultimately , this method converts the meta paths into anchored predicate paths",
    ".    intuitively , the use of more tightly constrained meta paths instead of predicate paths ought to increase the information richness leading to better results , but our initial trials showed that : 1 ) the use of meta paths significantly increased the number of variables in our fact checking model without any noticeable improvement in performance , and 2 ) the inclusion of noisy entity types from meta paths actually lowered the occurrence - rate of important meta paths resulting in lower discriminative power in the set of paths . a detailed discussion of these counter - intuitive results are provided in the experiment section .    to recap , at this point we have selected positive anchor - entities @xmath42 and negative anchor - entities @xmath45 .",
    "using those anchors we find many predicate paths @xmath91 and @xmath92 that connect the positive and negative anchors ; these paths are essentially alternate descriptions of the original predicate that provide evidence that can be used to uniquely define the original predicate .      in this section",
    "we describe the procedure used to find the most discriminative predicate paths @xmath93 from predicate path sets @xmath94 and @xmath95.for this we define @xmath96 to be an @xmath97 training instance matrix , wherein the @xmath98 row in @xmath96 represents a training instance from a pair of anchors @xmath99 and @xmath72 such that @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
