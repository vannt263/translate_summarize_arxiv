    "the information on the longitudinal spin structure of the nucleon is contained in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spin structure functions , with @xmath2 the squared four - momentum transfered from the beam to the target , and @xmath3 the bjorken scaling variable ( @xmath4 is the energy transfer and @xmath5 the nucleon mass ) .",
    "the variable @xmath2 indicates the space - time scale at which the nucleon is probed and @xmath6 is interpreted in the parton model as the fraction of nucleon momentum carried by the struck quark .",
    "although spin structure functions are the basic observables for nucleon spin studies , considering their integrals taken over @xmath6 is advantageous because of resulting simplifications .",
    "more importantly , such integrals are at the core of the relation dispersion formalism .",
    "relation dispersions relate the integral over the imaginary part of a quantity to its real part . expressing the imaginary part in function of the real part using the optical theorem yields _ sum rules_. when additional hypotheses are used , such as a low energy theorem or the validity of operator product expansion ( ope ) , the sum rules relate the integral to a static property of the target .",
    "if the static property is well known , the verification of the sum rule provides a check of the theory and hypotheses used in the sum rule derivation . when the property is not known because e.g. it is difficult to measure directly , sum rules can be used to access them . in that case , the theoretical framework used to derived the sum rule is assumed to be valid .",
    "details on integrals of spin structure functions and sum rules are given e.g. in the review  @xcite .",
    "several spin sum rules exists .",
    "we will focus on the bjorken sum rule  @xcite and the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the @xmath7-th cornwall - norton moments : @xmath8 , with @xmath9 standing for proton or neutron , and write the first moments as @xmath10 .",
    "the bjorken sum rule  @xcite relates the integral over @xmath11 to the nucleon axial charge @xmath12 .",
    "this relation has been essential for understanding the nucleon spin structure and establishing , _ via _ its @xmath2-dependence , that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) describes the strong force when spin is included .",
    "the bjorken integral has been measured in polarized deep inelastic lepton scattering ( dis ) at slac , cern and desy and at moderate @xmath2 at jefferson lab ( jlab ) , see refs .",
    "@xcite to  @xcite . in the perturbative qcd ( pqcd )",
    "domain ( high @xmath2 ) the sum rule reads : @xmath13 + \\sum_{i=2}^{\\infty}{\\frac{\\mu_{2i}^{p - n}(q^{2})}{q^{2i-2 } } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the strong coupling strength .",
    "the bracket term ( known as the leading twist term ) is mildly dependent on @xmath2 due to pqcd soft gluon radiation .",
    "the other term contains non - perturbative power corrections ( higher twists ) .",
    "these are quark and gluon correlations describing the nucleon structure away from the large @xmath2 ( small distances ) limit .",
    "the generalized bjorken sum rule has been derived for small distances . for large distances , in the @xmath15 limit",
    ", one finds the generalized gdh sum rule .",
    "the sum rule was first derived at @xmath16 :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the pion photoproduction threshold , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the helicity dependent photoproduction cross sections for total photon plus target helicities 1/2 and 3/2 , @xmath21 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the target while @xmath22 is its spin and @xmath23 its mass .",
    "@xmath24 is the fine structure constant .    replacing the photoproduction cross sections by the electroproduction ones",
    "generalized the left hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : gdh ] to any @xmath2 .",
    "such generalization depends on the choice of convention for the virtual photon flux , see e.g. ref .",
    "x. ji and j. osborne  @xcite showed that the sum _ rule _ itself ( i.e. the whole eq .",
    "[ eq : gdh ] ) can be generalized as :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the spin dependent compton amplitude .",
    "this generalization of the gdh sum rule makes the connection between the bjorken and gdh generalized sum rules evident : gdh@xmath27bjorken .",
    "the connection between the gdh and bjorken sum rules allows us in principle to compute the moment @xmath28 at any @xmath2 .",
    "thus , it provides us with a choice observable to understand the transition of the strong force from small to large distances .",
    "results from experimental measurements from slac  @xcite , cern  @xcite , desy  @xcite and jlab  @xcite@xmath29@xcite of the first moments are shown in figure  [ gammas ] .",
    "2    there is an excellent mapping of the moments at intermediate @xmath2 and enough data points a low @xmath2 to start testing the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath30 ) , the effective theory strong force at large distances . in particular ,",
    "the bjorken sum is important for such test because the ( p - n ) subtraction cancels the @xmath31 resonance contribution which should make the @xmath30 calculations significantly more reliable  @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the data at low @xmath2 and @xmath30 calculations  @xcite@xmath32@xcite can be seen more easily in the insert in each plot of fig .",
    "[ gammas ] .",
    "the calculations assume the @xmath28 slope at @xmath2=0 from the gdh sum rule prediction .",
    "consequently , @xmath30 calculates the deviation from the slope and this is what one should test .",
    "a meaningful comparison is provided by fitting the lowest data points using the form @xmath33 and compare the obtained value of @xmath34 to the values calculated from @xmath30 .",
    "such comparison has been carried out for the proton , deuteron  @xcite and the bjorken sum  @xcite .",
    "these fits point out the importance of including a @xmath35 term for @xmath36 gev@xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath30 calculations seems to agree best with the measurement of the bjorken sum , in accordance with the discussion in  @xcite .",
    "phenomenological models  @xcite,@xcite are in good agreement with the data over the whole @xmath2 range .",
    "a primary goal of the jlab experiments was to map precisely the intermediate @xmath2 range in order to shed light on the transition from short distances ( where the degrees of freedom pertinent to the strong force are the partonic ones ) to large distances where the hadronic degrees of freedom are relevant to the strong force .",
    "one feature seen on fig .  [ gammas ] is that the transition from small to large distances is smooth , e.g. without sign of a phase transition .",
    "this fact can be used to extrapolate the definition of the strong force effective coupling to large distances . before discussing this",
    ", we first review the qcd coupling and the issues with calculating it at large distances .    in qcd",
    ", the magnitude of the strong force is given by the running coupling constant @xmath38 . at large @xmath2 , in the pqcd domain",
    ", @xmath38 is well defined and is given by the series : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy scale , to be identified to @xmath41 .",
    "the first terms of the @xmath42 series are : @xmath43 with @xmath7 the number of active quark flavors , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the solution of the differential equation [ eq : alpha_s beta serie ] is : @xmath46}{ln(\\mu^{2}/ \\lambda_{qcd}^{2})}+ \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{4\\beta_{1}^{2}}{\\beta_{0}^{4}ln^{2 } ( \\mu^{2}/\\lambda_{qcd}^{2 } ) } \\times \\nonumber \\\\   \\left(\\left(ln\\left[ln(\\mu^{2}/ \\lambda_{qcd}^{2})\\right]-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\frac { \\beta_{2}\\beta_{0}}{8\\beta_{1}^{2}}-\\frac{5}{4}\\right)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equation [ eq : alpha_s ] allows us to evolve the different experimental determinations of @xmath38 to a conventional scale , typically @xmath47 .",
    "the agreement between the @xmath38 obtained from different observables demonstrates its universality and the validity of eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha_s beta serie ] .",
    "one can obtain @xmath48 with doubly polarized dis data and assuming the validity of the bjorken sum .",
    "solving eq .",
    "[ eq : bj(q2 ) ] using the experimental value of @xmath49 , and then using eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha_s ] provides @xmath48 .",
    "equation [ eq : alpha_s ] leads to an infinite coupling at large distances , when @xmath2 approaches @xmath50 .",
    "this is not a conceptual problem since we are out of the validity domain of pqcd on which eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha_s ] is based .",
    "but since data show no sign of discontinuity or phase transition when crossing the intermediate @xmath51 domain , one should be able to define an effective coupling @xmath52 at any @xmath2 that matches @xmath38 at large @xmath51 but stays finite at small @xmath51 .    the bjorken sum rule can be used to define @xmath52 at low q@xmath53 . defining @xmath52 from a pqcd equation truncated to first order ( in our case eq .",
    "( [ eq : bj(q2 ) ] : @xmath54 ) , offers advantages . in particular , @xmath52 does not diverge near @xmath55 and is renormalization scheme independent .",
    "however , @xmath52 becomes dependent on the choice of observable employed to define it .",
    "if @xmath49 is used as the defining observable , the effective coupling is noted @xmath56 .",
    "relations , called _ commensurate scale relations _",
    "@xcite , link the different effective couplings so in principle one effective coupling is enough to describe the strong force and the theory retains its predictive power .",
    "these relations are defined for short distances and whether they extrapolate to large distances remains to be investigated .",
    "the choice of defining the effective charge with the bjorken sum has many advantages : low @xmath2 data exist and near real photons data from jlab is being analyzed  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sum rules constrain @xmath57 at both low and large @xmath2 , as will be discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "another advantage is that , as discussed for the low @xmath2 domain , the simplification arising in @xmath58 makes a quantity well suited to be calculated at any @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "these simplifications are manifest at large @xmath2 when comparing the validities of the bjorken and ellis - jaffe sum rules .",
    "it also simplifies lattice qcd calculations in the intermediate @xmath2 domain .",
    "finally , it may be argued that @xmath57 might be more directly comparable to theoretical calculations than other effective couplings extracted from other observables : part of the coherent response of the nucleon is suppressed in the bjorken sum , e.g. the @xmath59 resonance , so the non - resonant background , akin to the pqcd incoherent scattering process , contributes especially importantly to the bjorken sum .",
    "this argument is reinforced if global duality works , a credible proposal since the @xmath59 resonance is suppressed .",
    "the effective coupling definition in terms of pqcd evolution equations truncated to first order was proposed by grunberg @xcite .",
    "grunberg s definition is meant for short distances but one can always extrapolated this definition and see how the resulting coupling compares to calculation of @xmath38 at large distances . using grunberg s definition at large distances entails including higher twists in @xmath56 in addition to the higher terms of the pqcd series .",
    "it is common to fold the dynamics due to forces ( here the higher twists ) into an effective parameter so that the particle can be treated as free .",
    "it is interesting to review quickly the characteristics of such effective parameters , e.g. in the field of quantum electronics .",
    "there , near the energy extrema of electrons moving in a crystal , the effects of external forces applied to the crystal are folded into effective masses and the electron motions can be described using the free schrodinger equation .",
    "then , the ( effective ) mass of an electron becomes a tensor @xmath60 ( that depends on the electron energy ) rather than a scalar since the crystal lattice is not isotropic and the total acceleration depends on the lattice forces .",
    "@xmath60 depends on the material and , near an energy maximum , @xmath61 is negative .",
    "holes also have effective masses of opposits signs as for electrons .",
    "effective masses are useful to determine quantities of interest of a material , such as the quantum state densities , the speed of electric signals . or the surface of isoenergy .",
    "this illustrates the relevance of effective parameters , but also that we should not be shocked if our effective couplings depends on reactions or are negative .",
    "effective couplings have been extracted from different observables , see fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_s eff ] .",
    "values of @xmath62 extracted from the world data on the bjorken sum at @xmath63 gev@xmath53 @xcite and from jlab data  @xcite have been compared using the commensurate scale relations   to @xmath64 extracted from the opal data on @xmath65 decay @xcite , and @xmath66 extracted using the gross - llewellyn smith sum rule @xcite and its measurement by the ccfr collaboration @xcite .",
    "there is good agreement between @xmath56 , @xmath67 and @xmath64 .",
    "the gdh and bjorken sum rules can be used to extract @xmath56 at small and large @xmath51 respectively .",
    "this , together with the jlab data at intermediate @xmath51 , provides for the first time a coupling at any @xmath51 .",
    "a striking feature of fig . [ fig : alpha_s eff ] is that @xmath56 becomes scale invariant at small @xmath51 .",
    "this was predicted by a number of calculations and it is known that color confinement leads to an infrared fixed point @xcite , but it is the first time it is seen experimentally .",
    "a fit of the @xmath56 has been performed and is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_s eff4 ] ( plain black line ) .",
    "there are several techniques used to predict @xmath38 at small @xmath51 , e.g. lattice qcd , solving the schwinger - dyson equations , or choosing the coupling in a constituent quark model so that it reproduces hadron spectroscopy . however , the connection between these @xmath38 is unclear , in part because of the different approximations used .",
    "in addition , the precise relation between @xmath56 ( or any effective coupling defined using @xcite or @xcite ) and these computations is unknown .",
    "nevertheless , one can still compare them to see if they share common features . in figure",
    "[ fig : alpha_s eff4 ] , @xmath56 extracted from jlab data , its fit , and its extraction using the burkert and ioffe @xcite model to obtain @xmath49 are compared to @xmath38 calculations .",
    "the methods used are solving the schwinger - dyson equations ( top left : cornwall @xcite ; top right : bloch @xcite ; bottom left : maris - tandy @xcite , fischer , alkofer , reinhardt and von smekal @xcite , and bhagwat et al .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath38 used in a quark constituent model ( godfrey - isgure @xcite ) and lattice qcd @xcite ( bottom right ) . the calculations and @xmath56 present a similar behavior . some calculations , in particular the lattice one , are in excellent agreement with @xmath56 .",
    "these works show that @xmath38 is scale invariant ( _ conformal behavior _ ) at small and large @xmath51 ( but not in the transition region between the fundamental description of qcd in terms of quarks and gluons degrees of freedom and its effective one in terms of baryons and mesons ) .",
    "the scale invariance at large @xmath2 is the well known asymptotic freedom .",
    "the conformal behavior at small @xmath51 is essential to apply a property of _ conformal field theories _ ( cft ) to the study of hadrons : the _ anti - de - sitter space / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence _ of maldacena @xcite , that links a strongly coupled gauge field to weakly coupled superstrings states .",
    "perturbative calculations are feasible in the weak coupling ads theory . they are then projected on the ads boundary , where they correspond to the calculations that would have been obtained with the strongly coupled cft .",
    "this opens the possibility of analytic non - perturbative qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "we discussed the jlab data on moments of spin structure functions , in particular at large distances where we compared them to @xmath30 , the strong force effective theory at large distances .",
    "the smoothness of @xmath2-dependence of the moments when transiting from perturbative to the non - perturbative domain allows to extrapolate the definitions of effective strong couplings from short to large distances .",
    "thanks to the data on nucleon spin structure and to spin sum rules , the effective strong coupling @xmath57can be extracted in any regime of qcd .",
    "the question of comparing it with theoretical calculations of @xmath38 at low @xmath2 is open , but such comparison exposes a similarity between these couplings .",
    "apart for the parton - hadron transition region , the coupling shows that qcd is approximately a conformal theory .",
    "this is a necessary ingredient to the application of the ads / cft correspondence that may make analytical calculations possible in the non - perturbative domain of qcd .",
