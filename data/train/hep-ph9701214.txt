    "core collapse supernovae emit approximately @xmath0 neutrinos .",
    "apart from gravity , these neutrinos only have weak interactions ",
    "whose hallmark is parity violation .",
    "can this lead to _ macroscopic _ parity violation ?",
    "the important role played by weak interactions makes supernovae ( or related phenomena ) unique among all macroscopic systems in the present universe .",
    "no other systems have this potential for large scale parity violation .",
    "one parity violating observable is a correlation @xmath1 between the neutrino flux in the direction @xmath2 and the direction of the magnetic field @xmath3 . as a result ,",
    "the entire neutron star , formed in the explosion , could recoil .",
    "this can be at a significant velocity because of the tremendous momentum of the neutrinos ( see below ) .    indeed , the observed velocities of neutron stars are large : with three dimensional galactic velocities of the order of 500 km / s @xcite .",
    "perhaps the simplest explanation for such large velocities is that neutron stars receive a significant kick at birth from an asymmetric supernova explosion .",
    "note that this asymmetry need not be solely from parity violation .",
    "for example , one could have a preexisting asymmetry in the collapsing stellar core as speculated by burrows and hayes  @xcite .",
    "these authors also discuss how an asymmetry may impact a detectable gravitational radiation signal .    in any case",
    ", there is a simple relation between the final velocity of a neutron star and the asymmetry of the neutrinos @xmath4 and other matter @xmath5 ejected .",
    "note , a supernova ejects the mantle and outer envelope comprising some 90 percent of the original star s mass .",
    "the binding energy per nucleon of a neutron star is about 100 mev / n .",
    "thus , neutrinos carry off 100 mev / c of momentum per nucleon of the neutron star ( which then has a gravitational mass of the order of 839 mev / n ) . in contrast",
    ", other matter only carries off about one percent of the binding energy ( 1 mev / n ) .",
    "however , the mass of this material is about 10 times larger than that of the neutron star , so that its momentum ( @xmath6^{1/2}\\approx 140 $ ]  mev / c ) is comparable to that of the neutrinos .",
    "the recoil velocity @xmath7 of a neutron star is approximately , @xmath8 with @xmath9 the speed of light and the asymmetry of the neutrinos is @xmath10 where the sum runs over all neutrinos emitted .",
    "there is a similar expression for the asymmetry of the other matter @xmath5 .",
    "_ to reproduce observed velocities of the order of @xmath11   one needs @xmath4and / or @xmath5to be about one percent .",
    "_    since matter and neutrinos are coupled , one expects both @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be nonzero , i.e. , an original asymmetry in one will produce an asymmetry in the other .",
    "thus , the interesting question is which came first ( the chicken or the egg ) @xmath4 or @xmath5 ?    in this paper we speculate that the original @xmath4 may stem from parity violation in a strong magnetic field .",
    "we assume conventional weak interactions for the neutrinos .",
    "others have considered nonstandard neutrino magnetic moments @xcite or matter enhanced neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "these could enhance the effect .",
    "however , one does not require new interactions for a nonzero asymmetry .",
    "thus , our speculation only depends on the existence of a strong magnetic field .    a number of pulsars are thought to have magnetic fields around @xmath12 gauss .",
    "however , the dipole field inside a supernova at early times could be stronger , perhaps @xmath13 gauss  @xcite . finally , it is possible that there are very strong _ non - dipole _ fields of the order of @xmath14 gauss  @xcite .",
    "for example , differential rotation could wind up the @xmath3 field into a very strong torus configuration . in section",
    "ii we calculate the neutrino asymmetry that these fields induce because of several parity violating hadronic and electron reactions .",
    "we discuss possible enhancements of the asymmetry and conclude in section iii .",
    "we end this section with a speculative note regarding macroscopic parity violation and the origin of life .",
    "cline suggests  @xcite that polarized leptons from a nearby supernova could influence homochiral organic molecule formation .",
    "this is an interesting but clearly very speculative atempt to explain why terrestrial life uses almost exclusively l - amino - acid enantiomers ( `` left handed '' mirror image molecules ) .",
    "although not directly related , we speculate that supernovae produce another macroscopic parity violating effect .",
    "the hypothesis that parity violation leads to an asymmetry and recoil may be more directly observed and tested .",
    "there are many possible sources of parity violation in a strong magnetic field .",
    "one would expect weak interactions involving electrons to be the most important because of the large electron magnetic moment .",
    "however , a large fermi momentum can make it harder to polarize electrons .",
    "furthermore , relativistic effects reduces the effective magnetic moment .",
    "finally , interactions with nucleons often dominate the neutrino opacity rather than interactions with electrons .",
    "therefore , it is possible for nucleon reactions to compete with electrons .    in this section",
    "we consider a number of reactions .",
    "perhaps the simplest is neutrino elastic scattering from polarized neutrons .",
    "the longitudinal asymmetry for this process is very large , @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the polarization of neutrons in a magnetic field @xmath18 is , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the neutron s mass , @xmath21 the temperature and we have neglected possible enhancements from the spin dependence of the strong interactions ( more on this below ) .",
    "elastic neutron scattering makes a significant contribution to the neutrino opacity .",
    "therefore , this will produce an asymmetry in the neutrino flux of the order of @xmath22 , which at a temperature near 3 mev is , @xmath23 with @xmath24 the magnetic field in units of @xmath13  gauss .",
    "this asymmetry , of the order of @xmath25 , is somewhat small compared to one percent .",
    "however , this simple mechanism is clearly present and provides a benchmark to compare other reactions .",
    "vilenkin  @xcite estimated the asymmetry of neutrino electron scattering ( nes ) while bezchastnov and haensel  @xcite calculated it in detail ; it is of the order of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 mev is the electron fermi momentum . here",
    ", one power of @xmath28 represents the relativistic electron magnetic moment and the second power describes the difficulty of polarizing a degenerate fermi gas .",
    "the nes asymmetry is about 10 times the neutron polarization .",
    "however , nes makes less then a 10 percent contribution to the total neutrino opacity ( indeed it is probably less then one percent ) .",
    "therefore the nes contribution to @xmath4 is probably smaller than eq .",
    "( [ neutron ] ) .",
    "note , nes does change the neutrino energy and could introduce an asymmetry in the spectrum .",
    "one should investigate this effect ; however , it is probably small .",
    "for example haxton and bruenn made large changes in the energy loss cross section and found only small effects on the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we now consider neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering in a polarized electron gas .",
    "nuclear scattering dominates the opacity , as long as many nuclei are present .",
    "furthermore , this cross section is impacted by screening from the dense electron gas  @xcite .",
    "polarization of the electron gas by the @xmath18 field will introduce an asymmetry in the nuclear cross section even for spin zero nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the asymmetry will depend on the large electron magnetic moment .",
    "therefore this process could produce a significant neutrino asymmetry .",
    "we are not aware of an exact calculation .",
    "instead , we present a simple phase space estimate assuming the magnetic field slightly polarizes the electron gas .",
    "we are interested in the interference of the electron particle - hole excitation shown in fig .",
    "1b with the direct neutrino - nucleus scattering of fig .",
    "parity violation stems from the weak axial charge of the electron interfering with the weak vector charge of the nucleus .",
    "the electron particle - hole loop is described by ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath29 , \\label{pol}\\ ] ] here @xmath30 is the four - momentum transferred to the nucleus and the electron propagator  @xcite @xmath31 has the usual feynman piece @xmath32^{-1}$ ] and a density dependent part @xmath33 which describes the occupied states in the ( slightly polarized ) fermi sea , @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the occupations of the fermi gas states polarized along or against @xmath37 ; for an electron at rest , the relativistic spin vector @xmath38 is chosen in the direction of @xmath3 .",
    "we assume a dispersion relation , @xmath39 which describes the interaction of the spin magnetic moment with @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the orbital contributions are small since in the weak field limit a very large number of landau levels will be filled . in any event",
    ", it is hoped that this simple approximation provides an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "we evaluate eq .",
    "( [ pol ] ) in the extreme relativistic limit @xmath40 , for zero energy transfer @xmath41 , and assume weak fields @xmath42 . moreover , at low temperatures one has @xmath43 , with @xmath44  the fermi energy . in a coordinate system with @xmath45 along @xmath46 and @xmath37 in the 1 - 3 plane one has",
    ", @xmath47 with @xmath48 the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath45 . in the limit of @xmath49 one has simply , @xmath50 the density independence of this result arises from a cancellation .",
    "the polarization of a relativistic electron gas decreases with density as @xmath26  while the density of states for particle - hole excitations goes like @xmath51 .",
    "the asymmetry in the neutrino - nucleus elastic cross section is , @xmath52 here @xmath53  is the weak axial charge of the electron ( @xmath54 for @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 ) , @xmath59  is the weak vector charge of a nucleus with charge @xmath60 and neutron number @xmath61 and the momentum transfer is @xmath62 . as long as the opacity is dominated by neutrino nucleus scattering this will produce a neutrino asymmetry of about , @xmath63 for nuclei near @xmath64fe .",
    "this somewhat small number arises from the factor of @xmath65  in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) . nevertheless , because of the large electron magnetic moment , @xmath4 is comparable to that from polarized neutrons in eq .",
    "( [ neutron ] ) .",
    "finally , we make a simple phase space estimate for the asymmetry from polarized electron capture on protons . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the electron mass and the neutron - proton mass difference . the rate for left handed electrons moving in the direction @xmath66 to be captured and produce a neutrino moving in the direction @xmath67 , @xmath68 into @xmath69 is , @xmath70 e_\\nu^2 n_{k\\downarrow } ( \\theta_e ) d^3k.\\ ] ] here @xmath71 is the momentum of the initial electron and @xmath72 is the occupation of left handed spin states ( for an electron moving at an angle @xmath66 with respect to @xmath3 ) . finally , @xmath73 is the scattering angle of the neutrino with respect to the initial electron s direction .",
    "the angular distribution is important .",
    "electron capture on a proton involves both fermi transitions with a forward peaked angular distribution @xmath74 and backward peaked gamow teller transitions involving @xmath75 . the sum is only weakly backward peaked ( @xmath76 )",
    ". a flat angular distribution will not produce a neutrino asymmetry because the neutrino `` forgets '' the initial electron direction , i.e. , neutrinos are emitted isotropically , independent of any asymmetry in the initial electron direction .",
    "therefore only the cos@xmath73 term will contribute and it involves the small factor @xmath77 .",
    "the occupation of left handed electrons along @xmath71 can be decomposed into spin up @xmath35 and down @xmath36 occupations along @xmath3 : @xmath78 as above we use @xmath79 , @xmath80 $ ] so that , @xmath81 \\left\\ { \\left({1+{\\rm cos}\\theta_e\\over 2}\\right)(k^2-eb ) n_- + \\left({1-{\\rm cos}\\theta_e\\over 2}\\right)(k^2+eb ) n_+ \\right\\}.\\ ] ] this gives , @xmath82 and produces a neutrino asymmetry of , @xmath83 we estimate the contribution from the emission of neutrinos near the neutrinosphere at a density of the order of @xmath84 g/@xmath85 and at an electron fraction ( number of electrons per baryon ) of the order of @xmath86 . here",
    "@xmath87 mev and @xmath88 this asymmetry is somewhat larger than the others that we have calculated .",
    "yet , it has been reduced by a factor of about 30 because of the nearly flat angular distribution .",
    "if it were not for this reduction , this reaction could produce a one percent asymmetry for @xmath24 near unity .",
    "note that one should check our phase space estimate with an exact calculation .",
    "if the @xmath3 field modifies the angular distribution it could substantially increase the asymmetry .",
    "we illustrate the sign of the electron capture asymmetry in fig .",
    "a vertical @xmath3 field polarizes electrons with spin down . as a result ,",
    "only electrons moving up are left handed and can be captured .",
    "however these electrons produce neutrinos moving down because the angular distribution is ( weakly ) backward peaked .",
    "thus the star recoils in the direction of the @xmath3 field ( up ) .",
    "in this section we discuss possible enhancements of the asymmetry and conclude .",
    "spin dependent strong interactions can enhance the magnetic response of neutron rich matter . this could increase the asymmetry from polarized neutrons .",
    "for example , kutschera and wojcik  @xcite speculate that a ferromagnetic state could form because of spin - dependent neutron - proton interactions .",
    "indeed the asymmetry could still be increased by a significant amount , even if a ferromagnetic state did not form . however , this enhancement is unlikely to be an order of magnitude or more unless one is very close to a ferromagnetic transition  which we think unlikely",
    ". therefore , we do not expect very large enhancements from the strong interactions .",
    "alternatively , the nonlinear dynamics in a supernova could enhance small microscopic asymmetries .",
    "indeed , the explosion energy may be very sensitive to the neutrino heating rate .",
    "consider the extreme limit of a heating rate that just fails to produce an explosion .",
    "a small asymmetry in the neutrino flux will produce a large asymmetry in the ejected mater by restarting the shock wave on only one side of the supernova .",
    "perhaps a @xmath89  asymmetry in the neutrino flux can lead to a @xmath90  asymmetry in the ejected matter .",
    "this should be explored with simulations incorporating a small microscopic asymmetry .",
    "we have considered a number of electron reactions which yield somewhat small asymmetries for perhaps accidental reasons .",
    "for example , polarized electron capture produces a reduced asymmetry because of a broad angular distribution .",
    "the natural size of an asymmetry is of the order of @xmath26 for degenerate conditions or @xmath91  for nondegenerate conditions ( with @xmath92 mev the neutrino energy ) .",
    "this is near one percent for @xmath24 near unity .",
    "thus , one should search for other electron reactions with large asymmetries .",
    "one possibility is @xmath93  which will be examined in future work .",
    "note that kuznetsov and mikheev  @xcite considered the related @xmath94 in a strong field .",
    "they find a relatively small asymmetry in @xmath5  of the order of @xmath95  @xmath24 .",
    "perhaps this is because @xmath18 is necessary to produce , both , the asymmetry and to make the process kinematically allowed .",
    "thus we expect @xmath96 to be more important because it is allowed even in the absence of @xmath18 .",
    "supernovae , because they are dominated by weakly interacting neutrinos , provide a unique opportunity for macroscopic parity violation .",
    "one parity violating observable is a correlation between the neutrino flux and the magnetic field directions .",
    "we have examined possible asymmetries in a supernova from known parity violating weak interactions in strong magnetic fields . to explain the large velocities of neutron stars one needs an asymmetry in the radiated neutrinos _ and or _ the ejected matter of the order of one percent .",
    "we have looked at a number of hadronic and electron reactions that give asymmetries of the order of a few times @xmath97 .",
    "these are somewhat small to directly produce the recoil velocity from a dipole magnetic field .",
    "however , they only involve known weak interactions and , thus , are clearly present and provide a benchmark to compare with more speculative possibilities .",
    "furthermore , these asymmetries are important if supernovae involve very strong non - dipole magnetic fields ( possibly as high as @xmath14 gauss )",
    ". one should continue to search for new reactions and or enhancements since the natural size of electron reaction asymmetries @xmath98  could produce a large enough effect ."
