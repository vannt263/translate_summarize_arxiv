    "quantum entanglement  @xcite is a fascinating phenomenon considered to be one of the main resources in quantum information and quantum engineering ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in general",
    ", detecting entanglement in various physical scenarios poses a significant problem .",
    "most widely used methods are based on measuring entanglement witnesses ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which are efficient but , typically , not universal and require some information about the state prior to its measurement",
    ". on the other hand , by performing standard methods of quantum tomography of a given state one obtains complete information about that state .",
    "thus , information concerning its entanglement can be extracted by an explicit calculation , through the postprocessing of the complete experimental data .",
    "however , full tomography requires measuring a large number of parameters ; this number scales with the square of the total dimension of a measured state .",
    "moreover , there remains one conceptually fundamental question , namely what is the minimal number of parameters that are experimentally feasible ( in the sense of , e.g. , linear optics ) that will nevertheless provide complete information about quantum entanglement independently of a general input state .",
    "this can be viewed as a question about a quantum processor with a quantum input ( state ) and a classical output ( giving a yes or no answer or some quantitative information about entanglement ) with minimal processing of classical ( incoherent ) information inside .",
    "early proposals regarding the detection and quantification of quantum entanglement without state reconstruction were based on the identification of polynomial moments .",
    "these methods made it possible to retrieve information on entanglement from the data spectrum of the partial transpose of the two- qubit wootters concurrence ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a significant quantum - noise reduction ) .",
    "they enabled sharp two - qubit entanglement tests , but required nonlinear postprocessing of the data to retrieve the original information about entanglement .",
    "independently of the above - mentioned line of research , the concept of collective entanglement witnesses  @xcite made it possible to construct collective observables for describing entanglement quantitatively in experiments  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the concurrence of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for recent developments ) eventually led to a quantitative experimental estimation of entanglement in terms of specific two - copy collective witnesses  @xcite .",
    "another interesting example of collective entanglement witnesses is a two - copy witness based on the geometric intuition of the concept of metric  @xcite .",
    "a number of multipartite tests based on the nonlinear functions of simple multicopy observables were developed  @xcite and several other quantitative  @xcite and qualitative  @xcite methods of detecting entanglement without quantum tomography were proposed .",
    "nevertheless , these techniques , although quite powerful , are not universal and the quality of their results depends on a given state .",
    "experimental adaptive approaches  @xcite were also proposed for the case of two - qubits which we shall focus on in this paper .",
    "although these methods are an elegant improvement , they do not satisfy the universality requirement .",
    "let us stress , however , that there exists a universal witness of entanglement ( uwe ) for a two - qubit state , as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and defined here in sec .",
    "this uwe can be measured by performing the joint measurements on the four copies of a given state  @xcite .",
    "however , so far no experimental implementation for such a measurement has been proposed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose a constructive measurement procedure that outputs the mean value @xmath0 of the above witness for any two - qubit polarization state of a pair of photons , thereby allowing us to detect the arbitrary quantum entanglement of such systems . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first experimental proposal of a universal ( sharp ) entanglement test with ( i ) elementary ( linear ) optics and ( ii ) practically trivial ( direct substitution for polynomial ) postprocessing of experimental data . to be more specific",
    ", the procedure has the unique advantage that it can be ( probabilistically ) utilized with the help of just linear - optical methods involving only a sequence of beam splitters and the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference .",
    "quite remarkably , no polarizing beam splitters or phase rotators are needed .",
    "this is especially important here because we consider only the polarization - encoded qubits .",
    "we start the presentation of our results with the analysis of the properties of the uwe symmetries of the observables needed for reproducing the three moments @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "then we shall provide the optical hom interference methods for reproducing the values of the moments .",
    "having found these values , one just needs to substitute them into the polynomial  ( [ witness ] ) and to check the sign of the final value .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we recall the definition of the uwe and show how the negativity and concurrence are bounded by some functions of the uwe . in sec .",
    "iii we present the main idea how to measure the uwe .",
    "a detailed derivation of one of our important formulas is given in the appendix . in sec .",
    "iv we relate our results to makhlin s invariants and find the minimum number of independent measurements required for detecting entanglement . in sec .",
    "v we describe our proposal of an experimental photonic implementation for the uwe detection . in sec .",
    "vi , we present two alternative implementations .",
    "we discuss our results and summarize in sec .",
    "the uwe , provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , is an operator @xmath3 such that its expected value corresponds to the determinant of the partially transposed ( marked by @xmath4 ) two - qubit matrix @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 which is given in terms of the moments @xmath7 $ ] . for convenience ,",
    "we refer to the observable @xmath3 , but also to its expectation value @xmath0 as the uwe .",
    "it follows from the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion that a two - qubit state is entangled if and only if @xmath8 .",
    "the explicit form of this witness , which is the mean value of the hermitian observable @xmath3 on the four copies @xmath9 of qubit pairs in a given state @xmath5 , is explicitly provided in ref .",
    "@xcite and constructed from permutation matrices .",
    "the main advantage of this uwe compared to other universal methods of two - qubit entanglement detection is that this is a linear observable that does not require solving ( unfolding ) nonlinear polynomial equations , which are more sensitive to errors , to obtain the information about a given state ( see refs .",
    "another advantage of this witness is that its rescaled value @xmath10 $ ] provides tight upper and lower bounds  @xcite on the negativity @xmath11 and concurrence @xmath12 of a two - qubit state @xmath5 , @xmath13{w},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the inverse of the polynomial @xmath15 on the interval @xmath16 $ ] .",

    "the lower bound @xmath14 can be given explicitly in terms of the universal witness value @xmath24 as follows @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27{2 \\sqrt{w^2 ( 16 w+1)}-2 w}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this lower bound and the upper bound are shown in fig .",
    "in order to directly determine the witness @xmath0 , we can measure all the moments @xmath28 separately . we know how to measure @xmath29",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , since it is equivalent to the purity of @xmath30 .",
    "the remaining problem is how to measure @xmath31 .",
    "as already mentioned , these moments were originally reproduced as the mean values of the observables constructed from permutation operators .",
    "however , the direct measurement of the observables seems to be difficult due to their relatively complicated structure .",
    "fortunately , we can express the moments @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) differently , i.e. , by decomposing the @xmath34th cycle into the products of inversions ( the swap operations @xmath35 ) as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 together with the swap operator @xmath39 and the single - qubit identity operator @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the states of the horizontally and vertically polarized photons , respectively .",
    "the products @xmath43 are not hermitian for @xmath33 , so they can not be measured directly . however , the operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 taken separately are hermitian and have other useful properties , i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . by applying these properties we can express higher - order moments of the partially transposed matrix as @xmath48 -1 , \\ \\",
    "n=3,4.\\ ] ] note that this method displays some analogy to the method of calculating the collective spin of two parties .",
    "let us define @xmath49 .",
    "then , in order to measure these two moments , we have to perform projections on the eigenspaces of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the implementation of these operations might be difficult for two reasons : ( i ) the large number of different eigenvalues of the operators @xmath52 ( positive operator valued measures ) , and ( ii ) the complicated structure of the corresponding eigenspaces with the eigenvectors corresponding to entangled multiqubit states .",
    "fortunately , the operator @xmath50 has only two different eigenvalues @xmath53 , resulting in two eigenspaces ; and the operator @xmath51 has only three different eigenvalues @xmath54 , hence it has three eigenspaces .",
    "therefore , one has to perform only the measurement of five projections on some of the eigenspaces to measure both @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the remaining problem is to find the eigenspaces and associate them with the specific settings of a multiphoton interferometer .",
    "measuring the second moment @xmath29 requires two projections .",
    "thus , the complete measurement of @xmath3 can be decomposed into seven projections ( this value may be even lower if some optimization is applied ) onto subspaces spanned by highly entangled multiqubit states , which is twice as efficient as a full two - qubit tomography .",
    "there is , however , another method of measuring the products of @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath33 that is better regarding the complexity of these projections .",
    "we can express @xmath57 in terms of the projectors onto the symmetric ( @xmath58 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath59 ) subspaces .",
    "then , as shown in the appendix , we have @xmath60 - { \\mathrm{tr}}[b_n p_n^-\\rho^{(n ) } p_n^- ] \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] for an arbitrary @xmath5 .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "then the symmetric ( @xmath58 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath59 ) projectors for @xmath33 read as @xmath63 for the operator @xmath64 , we can apply the same procedure but with the subsystems of the multiqubit density matrix swapped as @xmath65 .",
    "then , we have @xmath66 where @xmath67 , which means that @xmath68 , \\label{eq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "thus , it appears to be more convenient to project @xmath71 onto the symmetric or antisymmetric subspace of @xmath44 first and then to measure @xmath72 , as shown in fig .",
    "the moments @xmath73 are interrelated . in order to demonstrate this property , let us express the two - qubit density matrix @xmath5 in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath74 for @xmath75 and the single - qubit identity matrix @xmath76 .",
    "the resulting matrix reads @xmath77 where the elements of the correlation matrix @xmath78 are @xmath79 $ ] and the bloch vectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 have the following elements of @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 $ ] , respectively . it can be directly shown , after tedious calculations , that @xmath84 where @xmath85 are functions of nine local invariants of the two - qubit matrix @xmath5 as defined by makhlin in ref .",

    "it is apparent that only six ( instead of nine ) linear combinations of makhlin s invariants need to be measured to estimate the values of @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "these invariants read @xmath98 thus , in order to detect the entanglement via @xmath99 , one needs to measure exactly six instead of nine independent linear combinations of fundamental invariants .",
    "it also happens that this is also the minimal number of independent fundamental quantities describing the negativity of an arbitrary two - qubit state  @xcite .",
    "the analyzed projections @xmath100 are not the products of projections ( except @xmath101 ) , thus they can not be implemented by local ( two - qubit ) operations .",
    "let us note that the @xmath100 projectors split a collective multiqubit state into the states of positive and negative parities .",
    "this technique was also applied to , e.g. , the cluster - state preparation  @xcite .",
    "we can , however , measure @xmath102 directly as shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "note that @xmath103 can be measured using only beam splitters and photon detectors analogously to the methods applied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in figs",
    ".  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] we show a simple implementation of a @xmath45 block ( for @xmath104 ) . to measure the three parameters from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( four parameters without normalization ) instead of using the @xmath45 block we can reuse the @xmath105 part of the relevant setup to perform a @xmath106 projection ( see sec .",

    ", two qubits @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) for even ( odd ) @xmath34 can be destroyed in this process . in the most complex case of @xmath110",
    ", we have to perform a nondestructive parity test on six qubits , where two of them can be destroyed before measuring @xmath111 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath112 is more challenging than that of @xmath55 . in the comparison to the @xmath55 setup ,",
    "the main difficulty here is the necessity to condition the outcome of nondestructive measurements on @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "this is because both @xmath113 and @xmath114 are required in the latter part of the @xmath56 measurement .",
    "we can solve this problem by using ancillary photons prepared in the polarization singlet state in the modes @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the corresponding setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in some experimental approaches ,",
    "this setup can be further simplified by applying , e.g. , the time - bin methods  @xcite .",
    "our alternative proposal is discussed in the next section and shown in fig .",
    "finally , note that the relevant moments @xmath117 can be measured with the subblocks of the setup in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] if some information is ignored .",
    "( color online ) alternative setup for the direct measurement of @xmath112 .",
    "the method uses three known quantum gates : the xor , the cnot ( i.e. , the reversible xor ) , and the nondemolition presence detection gate .",
    "all these gates can be implemented using linear optics only .",
    "the xor gate can easily be constructed using a polarizing beam splitter and a set of half - wave plates ( hwp ) ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the cnot gate can be built using a special partially polarizing beam splitter ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "finally , the nondemolition presence detection can be achieved with the assistance of two ancillae  @xcite in the polarization singlet state .",
    "the method is successful if there are two photons registered by each pair of the photon - number resolving detectors @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , while one photon is detected by either @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "it is easy to show that the photon detection by @xmath121 corresponds to the @xmath123 measurement , while the detector @xmath122 heralds the @xmath124 measurement . ]",
    "the setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is fairly efficient and experimentally not overly demanding .",
    "unfortunately , it requires the photon - number parity measurement , which ( i ) is experimentally challenging and ( ii ) has photon losses in the setup that can result in incorrect measurement outcome .",
    "especially the second limitation hinders the implementation of the method since photon losses and imperfect detection efficiencies are unavoidable in real experiments .    to overcome this problem , in addition to the time - bin approach as already mentioned ,",
    "we have devised another setup , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , for the direct measurement of the @xmath112 term .",
    "in contrast to the previous setup , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , no parity measurement is required . on the other hand ,",
    "the new setup is much more complex and requires interferometric stability ( at some places ) .",
    "the idea behind the method is to use two quantum gates : the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate  @xcite and the exclusive or ( xor ) gate  @xcite . in order to join two cnot gates ,",
    "it is also required to introduce the nondemolition photon presence detection gate , which uses two additional ancillae in a bell state  @xcite . by heralding the presence of a qubit",
    ", this gate informs that the preceding cnot operation was successful .",
    "the entire measurement method is successful if two photons are detected by each detector pair among @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , while one photon is detected by either of the @xmath125 detectors and the presence detection gate also heralds a photon .",
    "further , if the detector @xmath121 fires , the method performs the @xmath123 measurement , while if the photon impinges on the @xmath122 detector , the setup implements the @xmath124 measurement .      if we take a look at the @xmath127 blocks with @xmath33 in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] , respectively , we will discover that we check for bunching and antibunching separately for each photon pair .",
    "in addition to the information about the outcome of the @xmath128 projections , we obtain the information about which of the photon pairs is bunched or antibunched .",
    "we do not use the which - pair information in any way ( we just need to know how may pairs bunched or antibunched ) and this measurement is not difficult to implement . however",
    ", one may argue that we gain more knowledge from our measurement that is necessary to measure @xmath32 .    to perform the @xmath127 measurement and not to distinguish between the pairs of photons",
    "one would have to use the same block as for the @xmath129 measurement and to swap the modes @xmath65 to perform the @xmath128 projections .",
    "this procedure would result in the four separate detection events : @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) ] associated with the single observable @xmath32 .",
    "this number of the detection events is now smaller that in the case of analyzing bunching and antibunching for each pair at the original @xmath127 blocks .",
    "the drawback of this method is that it is more experimentally challenging .",
    "however , by using the time - bin approach , analogously to that applied in ref .",
    "@xcite , we could reuse the same physical @xmath134 setup to measure @xmath128 at a later moment of time . to summarize",
    ", we may iterate the block measuring @xmath134 to get exactly the statistics corresponding only to four exclusive events .",
    "we showed how to directly measure the universal entanglement witness @xmath3 by using four copies of an arbitrary two - qubit state @xmath135 of a two - photon polarization state .",
    "our approach consists of three measurements associated with three moments of the partially transposed matrix @xmath136 , i.e. , @xmath137 $ ] for @xmath37 .",
    "the key issue is to calculate the number of parameters that were estimated in the process of measurement .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows us that we can estimate two independent quantities for each of the three moments @xmath138 , which after normalization become the probabilities @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "consequently , the output of the setup provides six parameters that are generally independent .",
    "note that there are nine parameters if the normalizations are included .",
    "the moments @xmath141 are interrelated .",
    "each higher moment is a function of lower moments and some additional parameters .",
    "after tedious calculations , we showed that @xmath142 are functions of nine fundamental makhlin invariants  @xcite of @xmath5 .",
    "the relevant invariants are @xmath143 ( see sec .",
    "iv ) . under closer inspection we discovered that only six fundamental quantities are needed to estimate the values of @xmath141 , i.e. , to detect entanglement via @xmath99 ( or to measure the negativity of an arbitrary two - qubit state  @xcite ) . these are @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "thus , our setup estimates no more quantities than those .",
    "note that local qubit unitary operations have three relevant independent real parameters ( excluding global phase ) .",
    "thus , the number of parameters of @xmath150 is six while the total number of parameters of a mixed two - qubit state is 15 .",
    "the resulting @xmath151 parameters are exactly all the relevant ones after introducing the @xmath150 invariant equivalence classes , and they correspond to the nine fundamental invariants .",
    "this number of parameters can be further reduced by swapping the subsystems of @xmath5 .",
    "this is probably the reason behind the minimalist character of this method .",
    "indeed , it requires no unitary operations , which may reflect the symmetry of the problem under local unitary operations .",
    "because of its simplicity , we believe that the presented setup paves the way for the first experimental realization of a necessary and sufficient universal test of entanglement .    finally , let us underscore that the key feature responsible for the success of the proposed approach is the sequential character of measurements .",
    "it seems that this property of the setup reframes the paradigm for entanglement , correlations , and any other nonlocal ( i.e. , not depending solely on the reduced density matrices of subsystems ) property of quantum - state detection and/or estimation in practice . as a result",
    "a more general problem can be conceived of . given only very specific measurement modules ( analogous to a beam splitter in the hong - ou - mandel interference experiment ) , which can be repeated in different subsystems ,",
    "is it possible to estimate nonlocal quantities and , if so , what setup would minimize the number of required measurements ?",
    "we developed a general method of the measurement of invariant - based moments of partially transposed density matrices .",
    "our detailed description of the method is focused on the detection of the entanglement of two qubits .",
    "this method can be generalized and applied to measure ( at least some ) moments of partially transposed density matrices of higher - dimensional systems too .",
    "nevertheless , such detection setups can be , in general , more complicated than the setups for quantum - state tomography . however , let us stress again the main result of our paper , which is the first proposal of an experimental entanglement detection without performing a complete quantum - state tomography .",
    "our method enables us to detect the entanglement between two qubits in an arbitrary state if and only if these qubits are entangled .",
    "the main idea of our method is based on the measurement of the universal entanglement witness , which is a necessary and sufficient entanglement condition for an arbitrary state of only two qubits . in this sense ,",
    "our universal two - qubit entanglement detection is not directly scalable for two - qudit or multiqubit systems .",
