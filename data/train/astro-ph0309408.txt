    "one of the primary goals of orbiting - vlbi , and the vsop mission in particular , is to image compact radio sources at low frequencies with resolution comparable to that of higher frequency ground - based only observations .",
    "this facilitates resolution independent spectral and polarization ( rotation measure and field orientation ) mapping of relativistic jets in agn , a capability that is compromised when only ground - based interferometers are used .    to this end , we have obtained polarization - sensitive observations of four bright 3c quasars using the vlba at 8.4 , 15 , 22 , and 43 ghz , plus coordinated vsop plus ground station observations at 1.6 and 5 ghz .",
    "here , we present some preliminary results from our first - epoch mapping of 3c  279 ( in april 1999 ) and 3c  345 ( from july - sept . 1998 ) .",
    "chen et al .",
    "( 2003 , this volume ) present results on 3c  454.3 ; work on the fourth source ,",
    "3c  273 , is in progress .",
    "the quasars 3c  279 ( z=0.536 ) and 3c  345 ( z=0.593 ) are well - studied vlbi sources ( e.g. piner et al .",
    "2003 , klare et al . 2003 ) and are ideal targets for this study because of their bright pc - scale jets . figures  1 &  2 show selected images from our first - epoch observations .",
    "the 5 ghz vsop images of 3c  345 previously appeared in moellenbrock , roberts , & wardle ( 2000 ) .",
    "although the addition of the spacecraft mitigates the resolution issue in our study , the non - simultaneity ( 5 days for 3c  279 and @xmath02 months for 3c  345 ) of the vlba only and vsop observations hampers a direct comparison of the images because of flux variability ; we plan to resolve this by extrapolating from other contemporaneous data .",
    "we aligned the images using well - defined optically thin features in the jets as labeled in the figures .",
    "the proper motion of c4 in 3c  279 ( 0.4 mas / yr ; homan et al .",
    "2003 ) does not compromise the image registration over the 5 day difference between observing epochs , and assuming a typical motion of @xmath00.3 mas / yr ( ros , zensus , & lobanov 2000 ) , the shift in 3c  345 is only @xmath01/8@xmath1 the beamwidth in the jet direction at 5 ghz ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "once registered , we see in both objects , that the brightest feature at 5 ghz is further downstream from the core than at the higher frequencies , and is not the core itself ( seen in the higher frequency images ) ; thus opacity effects are important within our observing bands . in 3c  345 ,",
    "the modelfits ( fig .  1 ) and polarization maps ( fig .  2 ) show that the core is almost completely self - absorbed and depolarized at 5 ghz .",
    "this may explain the lack of circular polarization in the core at 8.4 ghz , but its detection at 15 ghz ( homan & wardle 2003 ) .",
    "we find also a low rotation measure in the core and jet , as measured previously by taylor ( 1998 ) .",
    "the 3c  345 spectra also show hints that the jet is beginning to become opaque near 5 ghz ",
    "this should become more apparent in the 1.6 ghz vsop data .",
    "lastly , there is a noticeable shift in the position of its core measured at 5 ghz , with respect to the higher frequency 15 to 43 ghz observations , which can not be reconciled by component motions over the @xmath02 month elapse between the observations  it would require that all three jet components move more than 3 times faster than typically observed ( ros et al .",
    "analysis of the l - band vsop data for both objects are in progress , and observations at other epochs will track variability .",
