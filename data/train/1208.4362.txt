    "* ) .    although suggestive , much of the early work pointing toward a relatively constant ssfr was limited in many important aspects and based on a number of simplifying assumptions .",

    "@xcite , for example , used new measures of the dust extinction ( based on uv colors ) to correct the earlier ssfr estimates at @xmath22 . @xcite considered the possible effects of the optical emission lines on the stellar masses and ssfrs derived for high redshift galaxies , and this effort has been considerably extended in ( * ? ? ? *",

    "the images have integrations of @xmath49h ( the hudf was imaged twice , thus amounting to a total exposure of @xmath50h ) .",
    "the depths of the images were measured dropping 25 diameter apertures in empty regions of the image and determining the rms . after applying a @xmath51 flux correction to account for the light outside such aperture in the case of a point source",

    "the size of the irac psf , however , is too broad to use standard photometric techniques on our sample of faint lbgs . the flux within an aperture is expected to be contaminated by flux from neighboring sources spilling over onto the same aperture .",
    "the neighboring sources are in general brighter and the contaminating fluxes can be significant .",
    "the availability of higher resolution images ( though at different wavelengths ) with _ hst _ allows us to model the source and its neighbors and subtract off the expected contaminating flux in our apertures .",
    "this method has already been described in several previous works @xcite .",
    "after the area around the source has been cleaned from the flux of neighbors , we perform standard aperture photometry using 25 diameter apertures .",
    "an aperture correction is derived from the higher resolution `` _ template _ '' image , in this case the wfc3/ir @xmath32 image .",
    "this image is convolved to the resolution of irac and an aperture correction factor is estimated for a 25 diameter aperture .",
    "this correction factor is then applied to the fluxes measured with irac and involves multiplying the flux of sources ( in 25 diameter apertures ) by 1.8 in both the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] irac channels , consistent with the correction one would apply to point sources .",
    "the cleaning procedure can not always produce acceptable models of the source and neighbors , resulting in poor subtractions for approximately 40% of the cases .",
    "the individual _ cleaned _ stamps were inspected by hand and those with poor subtractions were excluded from the subsequent analysis .",
    "this criterion mostly depends on the feasibility of modeling the neighboring sources , and as a consequence , is not expected to introduce any significant biases in our results .",
    "it has been customary to study the physical properties of high - redshift galaxies by comparing their observed uv and optical seds with synthetic stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "the quality of the flux constraints is generally not adequate to constrain all model parameters simultaneously .",
    "in particular , models with a variety of metallicities , initial mass functions ( imf ) , and star formation histories can all reproduce the flux constraints almost equally well . as a result",
    ", these model parameters must be constrained independently or fixed to reasonable values . in the following analysis",
    "we have assumed a @xcite imf with cutoffs at 0.1 and 100 @xmath53 .",
    "it is expected that the metallicities of high - redshift galaxies be somewhat lower than that of local galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite , from a small sample of @xmath54 galaxies determines gas metallicities of @xmath55 .",

    "the resulting sfrs and stellar masses , which are the focus of this work , are only weakly sensitive to this assumption .    for the sfhs",

    "the trend in uv - to - optical colors ( after removing the effect of dust ) still shows a slight dependence on the [ 3.6 ] luminosity , but this is probably due to the fact that sources that are brighter in the rest - frame optical are on average older .",
    "this is similar to the results shown in @xcite , who show that the uv and uv - to - optical color trends exhibited by star forming galaxies in the @xmath77 range can be primarily explained by the effects of dust reddening , with a small contribution due to age .",
    "figure [ fig : colormagrest ] shows a very similar behavior at @xmath46 and 6 .    in view of this result , and to alleviate the difficulties produced by the age - dust degeneracies , in the following modeling we establish the dust reddening directly from the observed uv slope @xmath67 following the @xcite relation : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the attenuation in magnitudes at 1600  .",

    "the models used to estimate these redshifts correspond to the @xcite ( bc03 ) stellar population models with constant star formation history ( described in more detail below ) .",
    "these models do not incorporate emission lines .",
    "one of the goals of the current study is to assess the effect that emission lines can have on the properties derived through sed fitting , in particular on the ssfr .",
    "adding emission lines to the models can have important effects on the photometric redshifts that will also impact the stellar masses .",
    "for example , if emission lines are included in the models , galaxies with significantly blue observed [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colors are more likely to be placed at a redshift where emission lines can contribute to the irac photometry .",
    "this is because the optical colors of the stellar continuum are usually red and only the addition of emission lines can produce blue colors  at particular redshifts .",
    "if the photo-@xmath83 places the galaxy at a redshift were the irac photometry is contaminated by emission lines , the derived stellar masses will be lower compared to the case without emission lines .",
    "a problem arises because the strengths of the lines and the line ratios assumed and added to the models have a directly impact on the photometric redshift likelihood and , as a consequence , on the stellar masses .",
    "we would like to study the effects of different assumptions for the strengths of the emission lines and it would be useful to disentangle the effects of the emission lines on the photometric redshift and on the stellar masses .    since we will concentrate mostly on the effects that emission lines have on stellar mass and sfr , we have chosen to derive photometric redshifts ( and confidence intervals ) excluding the irac photometry , effectively removing the possible effect of optical emission lines on the photometric redshifts .",
    "hence these redshifts are mostly driven by the observed wavelength of the lyman break .",

    "for the rsf and the csf models , the sfr can be derived directly from the uv luminosities ( if the dust extinction is known  here we assume it can be derived from the uv - slope ) .",
    "in fact , figure [ fig : sfrvssfr ] shows that , as expected , the sfrs derived from the csf and the rsf model are on average the same with little scatter . since the final goal is to study the ssfr in our sample ,",
    "we now focus on the effects of the rsf on the stellar masses .    as can be seen in the figure [ fig : mstarmstar ] ( top row )",
    "there is a significant scatter ( @xmath99dex ) in the comparison between the csf and the rsf stellar masses . the mean value , however , does not change significantly when the irac detected sources are considered ( solid circles ) .",
    "the irac undetected sources , meanwhile , show a slight bias towards larger rsf masses , but this could be attributed to the poor constraints in the rest - frame optical , which is very important to derive stellar masses .",

    "it is however , inconsistent with the reports of @xcite , who finds larger stellar masses when a rsf is assumed . in their analysis",
    ", however , the age is fixed with a formation redshift @xmath100 , artificially fixing the ages of the sources .",
    "there is one important observation regarding the rsf models . a significant fraction of the sources that we have modeled result with ages that correspond to the maximal allowed in our set of models",
    "this is a result of the fairly red uv - to - optical colors exhibited by these galaxies ( after dust reddening corrections ) .",
    "the models considered here only include stellar continuum light , and as a consequence , these red colors can only be interpreted as older ages .",
    "two possible ways to alleviate this tension are : the presence of emission lines that would contribute to the flux measured with @xmath84/irac @xcite ; or a non - smooth component to the sfh such that the sfh is rising on average but there is a characteristic duty cycle that make the colors redder at any given age ( @xcite ; see also recent simulation results by , e.g. , @xcite ) . since many of the sources that present maximal age at @xmath9 are expected to be free of emission line contamination given their redshifts , the actual solution to the problem is probably a combination of both scenarios .    in summary , both the sfrs and the stellar masses obtained from the rsf are on average the same as for the csf model .",
    "we would therefore not expect the average ssfr to be substantially affected by whether one adopts a rsf or csf history for the stellar population modeling .",
    "we turn now to the effect of the possible contribution of emission lines to the rest - frame optical photometry .",
    "these lines are not expected to affect significantly the sfrs derived from sed fitting but they can , in principle , have a strong effect on the values derived for the stellar masses .    it has been suggested that a ( possibly large ) fraction of the flux detected with @xmath84/irac from galaxies at @xmath101 could be coming from nebular regions associated with star formation in the form of emission lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to directly observe these emission lines in @xmath3 galaxies with spectroscopy using current facilities .",

    "this technique , however , is only sensitive to objects with large h@xmath82 ew ( @xmath104 ) .",

    "@xcite find a lower mean h@xmath82 ew = 270   in the same redshift interval .",
    "independent evidence for extreme line emitters at @xmath105 come from @xcite who identify a large sample of such objects at @xmath106 based on _ hst _ wfc3/ir grism data .    since the direct observation of emission lines at these redshifts is not currently possible",
    ", we need to make assumptions based on our understanding of these lines at lower redshift . at @xmath107 , for example , @xcite find that the rest - frame ew of h@xmath82 for galaxies with @xmath108 is @xmath109 .",
    "the ew shows an increase with decreasing @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , this ew also seems to increase toward higher redshift . in a study based on _ hst _ grism spectroscopy from the 3d__hst _ _ survey @xcite , @xcite",

    "we estimate the effects that seem plausible based on these observations .    we take two different approaches . in our first , more conservative approach",
    ", we will assume that the mean h@xmath82 ew observed at @xmath113 @xcite remains constant at 100  at all redshifts @xmath90 and stellar masses .",
    "given the trends in the ew described earlier with stellar mass and redshift , this is likely an underestimate of the ew exhibited by real galaxies at very high - redshift .",
    "a more extreme approach is to assume that the trends observed at @xmath114 continue to higher redshifts following the same extrapolation ( equation [ eq : mattia ] ) .",
    "we call this the _ maximal _ emission line model . for each of the models ( _ conservative",
    "_ and _ maximal _ ) we derive the strength of all the other emission lines based on the flux ratios from @xcite assuming a @xmath87 metallicity and a flat @xmath115 underlying optical continuum ( i.e. flux ratios between the lines correspond exactly with ew ratios ) .",
    "then we calculate the contribution of the emission lines to the broadband magnitudes assuming the redshifts derived from the csf models in section 3.2 .",
    "figure [ fig : emlinecorrections ] shows the emission line contributions ( in magnitudes ) that we estimate as a function of redshift .",
    "the solid histograms ( arbitrary normalization ) show the redshift distribution of our samples .    in a previous study @xcite",
    ", we examined the median seds of this sample by stacking the photometry in bins of uv luminosity .",
    "the seds of @xmath3 galaxies show a consistent excess in their [ 3.6 ] flux over their [ 4.5 ] flux which , as argued in that work , can be explained by the effect of emission lines .",
    "it was shown in that work that a simple model with h@xmath82 ew = constant @xmath116  can simultaneously reproduce the observed uv - to - optical and @xmath117-[4.5]$ ] colors exhibited for the sample ( the corresponding ews for the other most prominent optical lines are @xmath118 , h@xmath67 , ) = ( 189 , 105 , 670) , respectively ) .",

    "next , we subtract the emission line contribution from the photometry , and we refit the seds with csf and rsf models . as expected , the sfrs derived in this way are unchanged in both cases ( figure [ fig : sfrvssfr ] , bottom row ) . this is because the sfrs of star forming galaxies ( with ages @xmath119 ) depend almost exclusively on the uv fluxes , which are unaffected by these emission lines .",

    "there will be galaxies with lower than average luminosities but high @xmath143 ratios , as well as bright galaxies with low @xmath143 ratios .",
    "since fainter galaxies are more numerous , the distribution of @xmath146 ratios within the bin is skewed to high @xmath143 ratios ( equivalent to lower ssfrs , see large filled squares in figure [ fig : muvmstar ] ) .",
    "@xcite recognize and discuss the differences that the @xmath143 ratio distribution at a given mass cause on the mean ssfr ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "nevertheless , they report their results assuming zero scatter in @xmath143 and suggest that the above effect could be offset by possibly higher uv luminosity to sfr conversion factors at higher redshift . meanwhile , in our estimates we consider the _ observed _ @xmath143 distribution at a given mass . neither approach is perfectly correct , but this explains why our estimates of the ssfrs are lower .",
    "ideally , we should use the intrinsic distribution of @xmath143 ratios , as opposed to the observed distribution which is broader due to modeling and observational uncertainties .",
    "a reliable estimate of the intrinsic scatter in m / l ratios is out of the scope of this paper given the absence of rest - frame optical spectroscopy , and will likely have to wait until jwst . here",

    "it is interesting to note that in the works of @xcite , @xcite , as well as our study , the ssfr evolution from @xmath9 to @xmath46 is quite small ( for a given set of assumptions , in particular , for sfh and emission line strengths ) .",

    "<S> we measure the evolution of the specific star formation rate ( @xmath0 ) between redshift 4 and 6 to investigate the previous reports of `` constant '' ssfr at @xmath1 , which has been in significant tension with theoretical expectations . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain photometry on a large sample of galaxies at @xmath2 located in the goods south field that have high quality optical and ir imaging from _ hst _ and _ spitzer_. we have derived stellar masses and star formation rates ( sfrs ) through stellar population modeling of the rest - frame uv and optical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the dust extinction from the observed uv colors . in the sed fitting process </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the effects of assuming a star formation history ( sfh ) both with constant sfr and one where the sfr rises exponentially with time . </S>",
    "<S> the latter sfh is chosen to match the observed evolution of the uv luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> we find that neither the mean sfrs nor the mean stellar masses change significantly when the rising sfr ( rsf ) model is assumed instead of the constant sfr model . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the ssfr at @xmath3 for galaxies in two stellar mass bins centered at 1 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the galaxies in the lower mass bin have very similar ssfrs to the more massive ones ( within @xmath5dex ) . </S>",
    "<S> when focusing on galaxies with @xmath6 , we find that the ssfr evolves weakly with redshift ( @xmath7 ) , consistent with previous results and with recent estimates of the ssfr at @xmath8 using similar assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> we have also investigated the impact of optical emission lines on our results . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the contribution of emission lines to the rest - frame optical fluxes is only modest at @xmath9 and 5 but it could reach @xmath10% at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> when emission lines of this strength are taken into account , the ssfr shows somewhat higher values at high redshifts , according to the relation @xmath12 , i.e. , the best fit evolution shows a value @xmath13 higher at @xmath11 than at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed evolution is substantially weaker than that found at @xmath15 or that expected from current models ( which corresponds to @xmath16 ) . </S>"
