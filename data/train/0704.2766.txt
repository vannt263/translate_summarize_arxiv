    "understanding hadronization , the process by which elementary partons ( gluons and quarks ) evolve into mesons and baryons , is complicated by its intrinsically non - perturbative nature . due to the fact that gluons carry two color indices whereas quarks carry only one ,",
    "the intrinsic gluon - gluon coupling strength ( @xmath13=3 ) is larger than the intrinsic quark - gluon coupling strength ( @xmath14=4/3 ) .",
    "radiation of secondary and tertiary gluons is therefore expected to be more likely when hadronization is initiated by a gluon rather than by a quark .",
    "this results in a greater number of final state hadrons as well as a larger average transverse momentum in the former case compared to the latter case . in the limit @xmath15 , the ratio of the number of hadrons produced in gluon - initiated jets to the number of hadrons produced in quark - initiated jets is expected , in lowest order , to approach a simple color - counting ratio 9/4@xcite .",
    "many experiments have searched for , and found , multiplicity and jet shape differences between quark and gluon fragmentation . at @xmath16 energies , _",
    "@xmath17 g _ events are distinguished by their three - jet topology . within such events , quark and gluon jets",
    "can be separated by a variety of techniques including vertex tagging . because gluons rarely fragment into heavy quarks , they will produce jets that form a vertex at the @xmath18 interaction point .",
    "quark jets , to the contrary , tend to form a detached vertex when the jet contains a long - lived bottom or charm quark . for light - quark events with gluon radiation",
    ", however , the assignment of final state hadrons to the initial state partons is generally more ambiguous and often relies on monte carlo simulations to determine the fraction of times that an observed hadron is correctly traced to a primary parton . at lower energies",
    ", one can exploit the decay characteristics of quarkonium states to directly compare gluon and quark fragmentation using data taken both on - resonance and off - resonance ( on the continuum ) , respectively .",
    "the 10 gev center of mass energy range offers a unique opportunity to probe quark and gluon fragmentation effects , without relying on monte carlo simulation to associate the final state hadrons with an initial state parton .",
    "cleo@xcite found that the thrust and charged multiplicity distributions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 two - gluon decays are more similar to @xmath3(1s)@xmath4 than to continuum @xmath5 events ; the reverse was found to be true for @xmath21 .",
    "specific particle production in gluon- and quark - fragmentation has also been studied . within the limits of their precision , previous studies at sld found inclusive production of pions , kaons and protons to be equivalent for gluon - tagged and quark - tagged jets@xcite .",
    "opal has measured inclusive charm production to be @xmath22% in gluon jets@xcite , more than an order of magnitude smaller than the rate observed in quark jets at the @xmath16 .",
    "aleph@xcite and delphi@xcite both measured inclusive bottom production in gluon - tagged jets to be @xmath23 , again considerably smaller than that expected from charge counting in quark fragmentation .",
    "most directly comparable to our current work , opal has also compared inclusive @xmath24 and @xmath0 production in gluon- vs. quark - tagged jets in @xmath25 events , finding inclusive production ratios ( @xmath26 ) consistent with unity ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively)@xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath7 allows one to directly compare the @xmath29 system in a @xmath30 event with the @xmath31 system in @xmath8 events . in these cases ,",
    "the system recoiling against the photon consists ( to lowest order ) of hadrons that have evolved from either a two - gluon or a quark - antiquark system .",
    "the properties of the recoil systems can then be compared . and @xmath32 to lowest - order only ; additional gluon radiation , to which we are not experimentally sensitive , may be present in many of the events in our sample . without the ability to adequately identify additional gluons , such higher - order radiative effects",
    "are therefore implicitly absorbed into the experimental measurement .",
    "] additionally , the radiative transitions from the radially excited @xmath3 states to the orbitally excited @xmath33 triplet offer an opportunity to further probe fragmentation differences between decays of the j=0 and j=2 @xmath33 states , which decay predominantly to two gluons , vs. decays of the j=1 state .",
    "since the j=1 state is prohibited from decaying into two on - shell gluons , the decay into one hard and one soft , nearly on - shell virtual gluon ( @xmath34 , followed by @xmath35 ) is kinematically most favored .",
    "statistical correlations between transition photons with inclusive production of particular final - state particles ( @xmath36 ) allows a measurement of the relative yields of @xmath37 to these species .    in an",
    "over - simplified ` independent fragmentation ' model , hadronization occurs independently for each parton .",
    "in such a picture , if fragmentation of each parton ( gluon or quark ) of a given energy is identical , then the ratio of particle production for @xmath38 hadronization should vary as : 2:2:2:3 . in the opposite extreme",
    ", fragmentation occurs in the stretching ` strings ' between the two partons , in which case the above ratio should be 1:1:1:3 .    in this analysis , we focus on the relative production rates of baryons ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) and heavy mesons ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 in gluon vs. quark fragmentation ( charge conjugation",
    "is implied ) .",
    "a previous study noted enhancements in the production of @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath39 in three - gluon decays of the @xmath3(1s)@xcite , at a statistical significance of no more than than 2 - 3  @xmath43 .",
    "that initial study also found approximately one unit larger charged multiplicity for three - gluon fragmentation of the @xmath3(1s ) compared to @xmath17 fragmentation at a comparable center - of - mass energy . with the limited statistics available at that time",
    ", the additional unit of multiplicity could entirely be accounted for by enhanced three - gluonic production of baryons .",
    "we now have sufficient statistics to re - measure the three - gluon particle production rates , and also to compare , for the first time , inclusive production in two - gluon fragmentation vs. inclusive production in three - gluon fragmentation .",
    "since then , other experimental data on quark / gluon fragmentation differences in the @xmath4410 gev energy regime have become available , including :    1 .   the observation that fragmentation of the j=1 state of the @xmath33 triplet ( @xmath45g@xmath46 ) results in charm production comparable to the underlying continuum ;",
    "no such charm production is observed in the two - gluon decays of the j=0 or j=2 states@xcite .",
    "2 .   an enhancement in production of hidden charm in gluonic decays of the @xmath3 resonances : @xmath47(1s)@xmath485@xcite at 90% c.l .",
    "production of deuterons from resonant 3-gluon decays of both the @xmath3(1s ) and @xmath3(2s ) at the level of @xmath49 ; no significant production of deuterons is observed from the continuum@xcite .",
    "enhancements per event are @xmath5010 .",
    "4 .   production of @xmath51 in gluonic decays of the @xmath3 resonance of similar magnitude to that observed in @xmath3 decays via @xmath17 : @xmath47(1s)@xmath522/3 ) , integrated over momentum@xcite .",
    "the cleo  iii detector@xcite is a general purpose solenoidal magnet spectrometer and calorimeter .",
    "the main components of the detector used in this analysis are the drift chamber and the silicon detector used for track finding , the crystal calorimeter for energy measurements , and the ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) and specific ionization loss in the drift chamber for particle identification .",
    "this system is very efficient ( @xmath5398% ) for detecting tracks that have transverse momenta ( @xmath54 ) relative to the beam axis greater than 200 mev / c , and that are contained within the good fiducial volume of the drift chamber ( @xmath550.93 , with @xmath56 defined as the polar angle relative to the beam axis ) . below this threshold , the charged particle detection efficiency in the fiducial volume decreases to approximately 90% at @xmath57100 mev / c . for @xmath58100 mev / c ,",

    "the central region of the calorimeter covers about three - quarters of the solid angle and has an energy resolution of @xmath60 with @xmath61 the shower energy in gev .",
    "this parameterization translates to an energy resolution of about 2% at 2 gev and 1.2% at 5 gev .",
    "two end - cap regions of the crystal calorimeter extend solid angle coverage to about 95% of @xmath62 , although energy resolution is not as good as that of the central region .",
    "the tracking system , rich particle identification system and calorimeter are all contained within the 1.5 tesla superconducting coil . flux return and tracking chambers used for muon detection are located immediately outside the coil and in the two end - cap regions .",
    "we use the cleo - iii data collected at the narrow @xmath3 resonances as a source of @xmath63 and @xmath30 events , and data taken just below the narrow resonances , as well as the below-4s continuum ( @xmath64=10.55 gev ) as a source of @xmath31 and @xmath65 events . since @xmath3(4s)@xmath66100% , data collected on the broad @xmath3(4s ) resonance is analyzed as a ` control ' sample , for which we expect no deviation from the below-4s continuum when we require a photon having @xmath670.5 .",
    "the @xmath68 in our continuum @xmath65 sample results primarily from initial state radiation ( isr)@xcite .",
    "we compare events for which the fractional photon energies are the same , which ensures that the recoil systems ( either two - gluon or @xmath17 ) have comparable energies .",
    "this convention deviates slightly from that of our previous publication@xcite for which the scaling variable was the recoil mass of the @xmath29 and @xmath17 systems opposite the hard photon ( @xmath69 , defined by @xmath69 = @xmath70 ) .",
    "comparison with continuum data taken @xmath920 mev below each of the @xmath3 resonances mitigates the effect of the @xmath91 gev continuum center - of - mass energy extrapolation between the @xmath3(1s ) and below-4s data samples required in the previous analysis@xcite , for which continuum data were only taken in the 10.55 gev center - of - mass region . to compare @xmath63 with @xmath17 hadronization , we simply bin by scaled momentum of the particle in question .",
    "we impose event - selection requirements identical to those used in our previous study of inclusive direct photon production in @xmath3 decays@xcite .",
