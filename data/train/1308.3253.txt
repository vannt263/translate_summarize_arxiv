    "centaurus a and m87 are two giant elliptical radio galaxies , which are classified as fanaroff - riley i ( fr i ) type sources @xcite . centaurus a , also known as ngc 5128 , is located at a distance of @xmath4 from the earth @xcite . meanwhile , m87 is some @xmath5 away @xcite .",
    "these galaxies host the closest active galactic nuclei to the earth and are the sources of high - energy radiation in the form of tev @xmath0-rays @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) detected some ultrahigh - energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) events within @xmath6 around the direction of centaurus a @xcite .",
    "besides , the pao showed a weak correlation between the arrival direction of cosmic rays with energies above @xmath7 and the distribution of agn s @xcite .",
    "both pao s results suggest , in this way , that centaurus a and m87 could also be the production place of uhecr .",
    "the presence of high - energy gamma- and cosmic rays in centaurus a and m87 would imply the existence of an associated flux of high - energy neutrinos produced from the interactions of both types of high - energy radiation with the ambient gas and photons of the corresponding galaxies . for the case of uhecr , @xmath1 production mediated by pion photoproduction has been widely studied in the literature ( see , for example , ) and its contribution is though to be the main mechanism of @xmath1 emission .",
    "however , it remains to be proved beyond any reasonable doubt that uhecr are produced in centaurus a and m87 to guarantee the production of neutrinos from the above process . on the other hand , although it is known that several agn s are @xmath0-ray emitters , the mechanisms of neutrino production induced by @xmath0-ray collisions @xcite in that context are scarcely studied , mainly because they are not expected to produce important @xmath1 fluxes due to their low cross sections . in any case , these secondary processes should be also contributing to the production of high - energy neutrinos in active galaxies . in the present work ,",
    "one of such @xmath1 production mechanisms is studied : the photo - hadronic interaction of gamma - rays with the gas and dust content of active galaxies , in particular , for ngc5128 and m87 , assuming that the gamma sources are located at the core of their agn s .",
    "accordingly , the corresponding @xmath1 fluxes are estimated and compared with those calculated in the framework of some astrophysical models involving uhecr .",
    "let s be @xmath8 the photon spectral luminosity of the agn measured in the source frame for a photon energy @xmath9 at a distance @xmath10 from the core .",
    "let s also assume that the gas and dust of the host galaxy are found in the form of protons and that their kinetic energies are negligible in comparison with the energies of the gamma - rays ( supposition that can work for the hot , warm and cold gasses of the interstellar medium @xcite , in such a medium , the mean kinetic energy expected for protons is roughly of the same order of magnitude , which results to be small in comparison with the gamma energies considered in this work ( @xmath11 ) . ] ) .    in this way , the neutrino spectral luminosity , @xmath12 induced by the interaction of the gamma - photons with the intergalactic material of the galaxy on their way out along the direction of the observer is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density of target protons at the distance @xmath10 , @xmath15 is the @xmath16 cross section at a photon energy @xmath9 and @xmath17 is the neutrino yield , which is defined as the number of @xmath1 s with energy in the interval @xmath18 around @xmath19 produced by a photon with energy in the range @xmath20 $ ] after a collision with a proton at rest .",
    "energy losses of the parent particles in the @xmath1-production chain have been neglected .    since , @xmath21 is unknown at the core of the agn , the gamma - ray luminosity at source derived from earth observations , @xmath22 ,",
    "will be used instead in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) . note that by doing so the estimated @xmath1 flux could be lower than the real one , since the actual @xmath0-ray luminosity could be bigger than @xmath22 at the interior of the agn @xcite .",
    "now , by using the above approximation , equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is reduced to the following expression : @xmath23 with @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the column density of target protons along the line of sight from @xmath26 up to @xmath27 , which corresponds to the size of the halo of the active galaxy .",
    "integration limits for the energy parameters are defined as follows : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the lower limit on the gamma - energies is set just at the threshold for pion photoproduction , @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the upper limit is fixed at @xmath31 , considering that the gamma - ray emission could be of leptonic origin and therefore that it could have a cut at the high - energy regime , somewhere around @xmath32 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the flux of neutrinos at earth is estimated from the @xmath1 luminosity of the active galaxy by means of the formula @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the redshift of the galaxy and @xmath35 is the neutrino energy after redshift energy losses .",
    "@xmath36 is the luminosity distance to the source , which is defined as @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath39 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath34 . for a cosmological scenario dominated by vacuum energy , with @xmath40 , @xmath41^{-1/2}.    \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] along this paper ,",
    "the following parameters will be used : @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite .    for the final fluxes of individual @xmath1 flavors ,",
    "neutrino oscillations will be taken into account @xcite .",
    "that implies that after a long way to the earth , neutrinos of different types will be present in the total flux in a @xmath44:@xmath45 : @xmath46 ratio .",
    "several gamma - ray observatories have measured the differential photon spectra of centaurus a and m87 in the mev - tev regime . for centaurus",
    "a , measurements of the @xmath0-ray flux in the interval @xmath47 have been performed with the egret detector on board of the compton gamma - ray observatory @xcite , while in the @xmath48 energy range , data has been collected with the _ fermi_-lat instrument @xcite .",
    "besides in the very high - energy region ( @xmath49 ) , data has been registered with the telescopes of the h.e.s.s . experiment @xcite . in case of m87 , its gamma - ray flux has been measured with the _ fermi_-lat telescope in the range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 and with hegra @xcite , hess @xcite and veritas @xcite in the energy regime of @xmath52 .    using the above observational data , the @xmath0 luminosities of the sources can be easily estimated .",
    "let s be @xmath53 the differential photon spectrum ( in units of photons per unit time , unit area and interval of energy ) detected at earth from the active galaxy . assuming a steady and isotropic emission , the photon spectral luminosity of the agn is calculated by using @xmath54 where corrections for both adiabatic energy losses due to the redshift and attenuation due to interactions with the background radiation are considered .",
    "the latter is done introducing the exponential term , where the parameter @xmath55 appears .",
    "here , @xmath56 represents the @xmath57 optical depth for a photon traveling from the source with initial energy @xmath9 .",
    "the values used for @xmath56 were taken from reference @xcite .",
