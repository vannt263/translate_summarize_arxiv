    "the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) , proposed in 1963 @xcite , constitutes an excellent theoretical approach to describe analytically the interaction of a two level atom with a single mode of a quantized radiation field .",
    "the field frequency may belong either to the optical domain or to the microwave one . in the first case the researchers use common atoms @xcite whereas in second case they use ( highly excited ) rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "the issue was also extended to other systems , as ( i ) in nanocircuits operating in microwave domain , either through the substitution of the atom by a copper - pair box ( cpb ) and the field by a nanomechanical resonator in nanocavities @xcite ; ( ii ) or the cpb inside a chip @xcite ;  ( iii ) substituting the atom by quantum a dot embedded in a photonic - crystal ad ; ( iv ) using spin in quantum - dot arrays @xcite , etc . in spite of its simplicity",
    "the jcm gives exact solutions of the schrdinger equation in many examples that occur in such physical systems .",
    "the jcm has been employed in the study of various fundamental quantum aspects involving the matter - radiation . to give some examples we mention : collapse and revival of the atomic inversion @xcite ; the rabi frequency of oscillation for a given atomic transition acted upon by a light field @xcite ; nonclassical statistical distributions of light fields @xcite , antibunching effect @xcite ; squeezed states @xcite , and others .",
    "an alternative model that maintains various characteristics of the jcm and offers advantages in certain situations was proposed by buck - sukumar in 1981 , abbreviated as bsm @xcite .",
    "it is called intensity - dependent jcm , since it substitutes the jcm interaction @xmath0 by another interaction that includes the number operator @xmath1  in this way : @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the previous expressions @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) stands for annihilation ( creation ) operator , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is lowering ( raising ) operator , ( @xmath9 ) is the number operator , and @xmath10 stands for the atom - field coupling .",
    "this model also leads to analytical solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "it has been argued that its physical simulation in laboratory could be implemented via matrices of waveguides @xcite ; optical  analogies of quantum systems realized in waveguide arrays have recently impacted the field of integrated optical structures @xcite . in particular , susy photonic lattices can be used to provide phase matching conditions between large number of modes allowing the pairing of isospectral crystals @xcite . in spite of its apparent theoretical nature",
    "the bsm has attracted the attention of various researchers in the quantum optical community .",
    "shanta , sivakumar , ahmed , rlm , yang , cardimona , yang1,yang2,dukelsky , reeta , buzek , valverde , sayed , cordeiro .    in 1992 p. shanta ,",
    "s. chaturvedi , and v. srinivasana ( scs - model ) proposed an extension of the intensity - dependent jcm @xcite .",
    "this model interpolates between the jcm and the bsm . in this approach",
    "the authors assumed the modified hamiltonian ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the number operator and the operators @xmath5 , @xmath6 are quons operators satisfying the the commutation relation @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is a c - number restricted to the interval @xmath15.$ ]  accordingly , quons would stand for particles intermediate between bosons ( @xmath16 ) and fermions ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the authors then use specific connections between the operator @xmath12 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 and prove that the scs model interpolates between the bsm and jcm in the limits @xmath16 and @xmath18 respectively , with @xmath14 playing the role of the interpolating parameter . however , although being a creative approach , here we will not take it forward because we are restricting ourselves to photonic field , not to quons .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite there are other nonlinear models in this context , but they treats the coupled system only approximately vad    another type of intensity - dependent jcm , was proposed in 2002 by s. sivakumar @xcite , named here as sivakumar model ( sm ) .",
    "this model also  interpolates between the jcm and the bsm via the following hamiltonian ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 stand respectively for annihilation @xmath22 and creation @xmath23 operators .",
    "the change from @xmath5 to @xmath24  aims to get a convenient deformed algebra for various theoretical applications , as in group theory , field theory , and others .",
    "as established in @xcite , for @xmath25 one has the heisenberg - weyl algebra generated by @xmath26 and for @xmath27 one finds the @xmath28 algebra . for _ _  _ _ all values of @xmath29 the algebra is closed ,    @xmath30=2\\hat{k}_{0},\\text { } [ \\hat{k}_{0},\\hat{k}^{\\dagger } ] = k\\hat{k}^{\\dagger } , \\text { } [ \\hat{k}_{0},\\hat{k}]=-k\\hat{k } , \\label{asm2}\\ ] ]    with @xmath31 we note some resemblance between the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ asm1 ] ) and that given by the bsm for @xmath32 as pointed out by the authors , the bsm is only reached when the mean photon number of the field satisfies the condition @xmath33 @xmath34 leading the term @xmath35 to an approximate form of bsm @xmath36 @xmath37    a somewhat ` similar ' model , also intensity - dependent , was proposed in 2014 by rodrgues - lara @xcite , named here as rodrgues - lara model ( rlm ) , constituting a generalization of bsm since it substitutes the operator @xmath38 of the bsm by the operator @xmath39 .",
    "the rlm recovers the bsm in the limit @xmath40 but it includes the counter - rotating terms , due to the form of the interaction hamiltonian ,    @xmath41    where the decomposition @xmath42 explains the appearance of counter - rotating terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 as well known , separately they do not conserve energy . also , due to the inclusion of the counter rotating terms , this model puts a restriction on the average number of photons .    in this report",
    "we present a generalized hamiltonian that provides a continuous and exact interpolation between various hamiltonian models , including the jcm , bsm , sm , and rlm .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ]  we briefly discuss this class of hamiltonian , showing its interpolating property . in sec .",

    "now , our mentioned class of interpolating hamiltonians is obtained substituting @xmath49 by @xmath50 given by    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55    here it is easily seen that the hamiltonian in eq.([a1a ] ) interpolates between the various interaction models of hamiltonians , as follows :    * the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite  for @xmath56 and @xmath57 * the buck - sukumar model ( bsm ) @xcite for @xmath58 and @xmath59 * the sivakumar model ( sm )  @xcite for @xmath60 and @xmath57 * the rodrgues - lara model  ( rlm ) @xcite for @xmath58 and @xmath61    some basic properties involving these atomic and field operators are ,    @xmath62 & = & \\pm 2\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\pm } , \\text{\\ } [ \\hat{\\sigma}_{+},\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}]=\\hat{\\sigma}_{z } ,   \\label{cc1 } \\\\ \\lbrack \\hat{a},\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } ] & = & 1,\\text { } [ \\hat{a},\\hat{n}]=\\hat{a},\\text { } [ \\hat{a}^{\\dagger } , \\hat{n}]=-\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath63=\\hat{r},\\text { } [ \\hat{r}^{\\dagger } , \\hat{n}]=-\\hat{r}^{\\dagger } , \\text { } [ \\hat{r},\\hat{r}^{\\dagger } ] = 2\\hat{r}_{0}=\\delta + \\xi + 2\\xi \\hat{n } ,   \\label{cc3}\\ ] ]    with @xmath64 thus we have a closed algebra in this scenario , @xmath65=2\\hat{r}_{0},\\text { } [ \\hat{r}_{0},\\hat{r}^{\\dagger } ] = \\xi \\hat{r}^{\\dagger } , \\text { } [ \\hat{r}_{0},\\hat{r}]=-\\xi \\hat{r}.\\ ] ]    the eq.([a1a ] ) can be rewritten in the form ,    @xmath66    where ,    @xmath67    with @xmath68  @xmath69  next we can use the eqs.(cc1 ) and ( [ cc3 ] ) to show that @xmath70 and @xmath71  are constant of motion , namely , @xmath72=[\\mathscr{h},\\hat{\\mathscr{h}}_{i}]=[\\hat{\\mathscr{h}}_{a},\\hat{\\mathscr{h}}_{i}]=0.\\]]all essential dynamic properties contained in a state of the atom - field system described by any of the previous interpolating hamiltonians , can also be described by the interpolating hamiltonian proposed here , @xmath71 , considering that @xmath70 contributes only for general phase factors , usually not relevant .",
