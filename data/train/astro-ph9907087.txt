    "earlier we have already considered the morphology of gaseous flows in semidetached binary systems [ 16 ] . within the framework of the 3d numerical simulations we determined that the presence of rarefied circumbinary gas substantially changes the structure of gas flows in the system . in particular , the self - consistent solution does not include shock interaction between the stream of gas from the inner lagrangian point @xmath0 and the forming accretion disk ( ` hot spot ' ) .",
    "however , these solutions were obtained for relatively high viscosity in the disk because the insufficient power of the computer used precluded fine grid calculations . in terms of the @xmath1-disk",
    "the numerical viscosity was @xmath2 .",
    "at the same time , the problem of flow structure at low viscosity is of great interest .",
    "this is primarily because the modern simulations of dwarf novae are based on the assumption that the accretion disk has two states with low and high viscosity ( see , e.g. , [ 710 ] ) .",
    "the validity of this ` limit cycle variation ' model has been confirmed by observational data ( see , e.g. , [ 10,11 ] ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the general morphology of gas flows in semidetached binary systems with low viscosity .",
    "particular attention will be paid to the problem whether the flow structure remains the same with a decrease in viscosity , and , in particular , whether the stream - disk interaction retains its shock - free pattern as was shown in [ 1,2 ] for relatively high viscosity .",
    "study of stream - disk interaction and the related problem of the absence of ` hot spot ' is of great importance for the interpretation of the observations .    in present work we used euler equations describing the flow of unviscous gas ( similar to works [ 16 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior of the solution is influenced by the numerical viscosity .",
    "the presence of the only numerical viscosity and the absence of the physical one in the simulation restricts detailed investigation of the problem , while the dependence of the solution on the viscosity can be described qualitatively .",
    "because numerical viscosity ( assuming the finite  difference scheme is already chosen ) depends on the spatial and time resolution , the viscosity dependence of the solution can be obtained in sequential runs with decreasing size of the gridcell .",
    "let us consider the semidetached binary system with mass ratio @xmath3 . to describe the gas flow in this binary system we used the 3d system of euler equations",
    "@xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8 here , @xmath9 denotes density ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 components of the velocity vector @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the pressure ; @xmath18 is the total specific energy ; @xmath19 is the total specific enthalpy ; and @xmath20 is the roche potential :    @xmath21 @xmath22 is binary s angular velocity ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the radius - vectors of centers of mass of system components ; and @xmath25 is the radius - vector of center of masses of a binary system .",
    "the calculations were carried out in the non - inertial cartesian coordinate system rotating together with the binary system .",
    "origin of coordinates is located in the center of a mass - losing component , ` @xmath13'-axis is directed along the line connecting the centers of stars , from the mass - losing component to the accretor , ` @xmath15'-axis is directed along the axis of rotation , and @xmath14-axis is determined so that we obtain a right - hand coordinate system . to close the system of equations",
    ", we used the equation of state of ideal gas @xmath26 , where @xmath27 as it usually is the ratio of heat capacities . to mimic the system with radiating losses , we accept in the model the value of adiabatic index close to unit : @xmath28",
    ", that corresponds to the case close to the isothermal one [ 12,13 ] .    to obtain numerical solution of the system of equations we used the roe",
    " osher tvd scheme of a high approximation order [ 14,15 ] with einfeldt modification [ 16 ] .",
    "the original system of equations was written in a dimensionless form .",
    "to do this , the spatial variables were normalized to the distance between the components @xmath29 , the time variables were normalized to the reciprocal angular velocity of the system @xmath30 , and the density was normalized to its value in the inner lagrangian point @xmath0 .",
    "as it was noted above we decreased numerical viscosity by changing of the gridcell size .",
    "unfortunately , the limited power of the computer used did not allow us to simulate the flow over a large domain ( as in the calculations in [ 16 ] where the size of computational domain was 3 times larger than the binary system separation ) on a fine grid .",
    "therefore , similarly to works [ 1720 ] , the gas flow was simulated over a restricted domain that was set as parallelepipedon @xmath31\\times[-\\slantfrac{1}{2}a\\ldots \\slantfrac{1}{2}a]\\times[0\\ldots \\slantfrac{1}{4}a]$ ] ( calculations were conducted only in the top half - space ) .",
    "a sphere with a radius of representing the accretor was cut out of the calculation domain . by way of illustration ,",
    "the parameters of the calculation domain in the equatorial plane are shown in fig .  1 ( solid line ) ; the dashed curves are the roche equipotentials , and the dashed - dotted lines show the boundary of the calculation domain adopted in [ 16 ] .    as the initial conditions we used rarefied gas with the following parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the boundary conditions were determined as follows : we preset the conditions in a fictitious gridpoint corresponding to the inner lagrangian point : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ; the velocity of sound in this gridpoint was equal to @xmath39 .",
    "in fictitious points located inside of the accretor and also in the fictitious points on the outer border except @xmath0 point all the parameters were taken equal to the initial ( ` background ' ) values . the final ( numerical ) boundary conditions were determined by solving the riemann problem between the gas parameters in fictitious gridpoints and the gas parameters in the closest gridpoint .",
    "in [ 16 ] we studied the morphology of flow over a complete computational domain that is few times larger than binary separation @xmath29 and includes both system components ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in these calculations the circumbinary envelope was found to play an important role in formation of the flow structure .",
    "the use of a restricted calculated domain in numerical model precludes the account of the circumbinary envelope and , hence , the ` restricted ' solution can appreciably differ from the ` complete ' one .",
    "let us consider the effect of the restricted calculated domain on the solution .",
    "we compare the structure of flow from the ` complete ' model [ 6 ] and the calculation obtained at the same grid in the restricted domain .",
    "figures  2a and  2b depict isolines of density and the velocity vectors in the equatorial plane of the system for the ` complete ' and the ` restricted ' calculations , respectively .",
    "figures  2a and  2b also represent the boundary ( ` marginal ' ) flowline of the stream , along which the matter falls directly in the disk .",
    "comparison of the results proves that the morphology of flows in the region near the disk in the ` restricted ' problem reflects the basic features of flow patterns of the ` complete ' solution .",
    "in particular , an accretion disk forming in the system has approximately the same linear size and shock waves @xmath40 and @xmath41 appear as a result of interaction of gas of the circumbinary envelope with the stream from @xmath0 ( note that hereinafter the position of shock waves is determined by condensing of density isolines and the presence of mass flow through the surface ) . meanwhile , in the ` restricted ' problem the effect of the circumbinary envelope is taken into account not quite correctly .",
    "in particular , matter flows along the roche lobe of a donor - star that result in the stripping of the atmosphere of a donor - star and essential increase in the rate of mass transfer in the system are not taken into account ( see [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this fact causes essential change in the parameters of the stream of the ` restricted ' problem in comparison to the ` complete ' one ( see fig .",
    "3 where one - dimensional distributions of density along a line parallel to ` @xmath14'-axis and lying in equatorial plane are shown for ` complete ' and the ` restricted ' calculations ) .",
    "in particular , in the ` restricted ' problem the stream flowing out from @xmath0 tends to extend to the characteristic value @xmath42 [ 21 ] , and the density decreases along the cross - section of the stream by exponential law , while in the ` complete ' problem the density of flowing matter is considerably determined by the stripping effect of the atmosphere of the donor - star .",
    "moreover , the ` restricted ' problem does not take account of the flow of the circumbinary gas returning in the system under the impact of coriolis force ( from the side of the stream which is opposite to the orbital motion ) . as a results",
    ", shock wave @xmath43 disappears in the ` restricted ' problem but exists in the ` complete ' one . summarizing the results of comparison the ` complete ' ( the basic features of the obtained flow structure for ` complete ' formulation are summarized on the schematic diagram  fig .  4 ) and",
    "the ` restricted ' problems , we can state that :    * in the ` restricted ' problem the effect of the circumbinary envelope on the solution is considered not quite correctly . as a results , it causes , from one hand , qualitative changes of the solution : a part of flows of the circumbinary gas returning in the system is absent in the ` restricted ' solution ( flowlines @xmath44 and @xmath45 in fig .",
    "4 ) , and , hence , shock wave @xmath43 disappears ; on the other hand , quantitative changes : the parameters of stream change because the stripping effect is not taken into account , and , in particular , the thickness of the stream tends to decrease . *",
    "the morphology of gaseous flows in the vicinity of the accretor in the ` restricted ' and the ` complete ' solutions is similar at a qualitative level .",
    "the partial account of the circumbinary envelope in the ` restricted ' problem ( e.g. , the matter revolving around the accretor and interacting with a stream  see flowline @xmath46 in fig .",
    "4 ) allows one to obtain the solution similar to the ` complete ' one .",
    "in particular , both in the ` complete ' problem ( see [ 16 ] ) and in the ` restricted ' solution the flow deflecting under the impact of gas of the circumbinary envelope approach to the disk at a tangent line and does not cause shock disturbances of the edge of disk ( ` hot spot ' ) . in both solutions the regions of superfluous energy release",
    "are located along the edge of stream facing towards the orbital motion where the interaction of the circumbinary envelope with the stream causes extended shock wave @xmath40 to form ( see figs  2,4 ) .",
    "the comparison of the ` restricted ' and the ` complete ' problems discussed above proves that stream ",
    "disk interaction can also be considered with some clauses in the ` restricted ' problem .",
    "therefore , we can conduct the fine grid calculations and , hence , to get the solutions at lower viscosity . accordingly",
    ", we can study the impact of viscosity value on the flow structure in the vicinity of the accretor and consider the problem of ` hot spot ' appearance at low viscosity .    to study the effect of viscosity we consider the results of three calculations with the various spatial resolution : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ( hereinafter , ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' runs , respectively ) . in all the calculations",
    "the grid was taken uniform . in terms of @xmath1-disk , the numerical viscosity of ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' runs corresponded to @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "comparison of the results of ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' runs among each other and with the results of study [ 20 ] , where grid @xmath53 was used within the framework of the same problem setup allows one to study the impact of viscosity on the solution .",
    "figures  5a ,  5b and  5c show the fields of density and the velocity vectors in the equatorial plane of the system for ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' variants and also flowline @xmath46 bounding the accretion disk . numerical analysis of the obtained solutions proves the shock - free interaction of the stream and the disk in all variants of calculations .",
    "the morphology of the stream - disk system is uniform and , hence , the ` hot spot ' does not form .",
    "this fact is obvious from fig .",
    "6 showing the distributions of dimensionless temperature in ` @xmath54'-plane for run ` c ' ( at the minimal value of viscosity ) for four values of ` @xmath15'-coordinate : @xmath55  the equatorial plane , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , where the height of the gridcell @xmath59 .",
    "the dimensionless temperature in point @xmath0 is equal to @xmath60 . to obtain the dimensional temperature one should multiply the dimensionless value by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the gravitational constant",
    ", @xmath63 is the total mass of the system , @xmath29 is the system separation , @xmath64 is the gas constant .",
    "analysis of the temperature fields shown in fig .",
    "6 proves the absence of the energy release zone in the place of contact of a stream and a disk , i.e. the absence of ` hot spot ' at all values of ` @xmath15'-coordinate .",
    "consideration of the change in the gas parameters along the flowlines supports this conclusion .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "7 depicts the change of dimensionless temperature along flowline @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "5c ) , from which one may conclude that ` hot spot ' is absent in the place of contact of a stream and a disk ( zone ` 1 - 2 ' ) and that the energy release region locates in the place of forming shock wave @xmath40 ( zone ` 3 - 4 ' in figs .",
    "5c and  7 )    comparative analysis of the obtained solutions proves ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "5a , b , c ) that increasing of spatial resolution and , hence , reduction of numerical viscosity causes reduction of diffusion spreading of the stream . in the runs with a thinner stream ( ` b ' and `",
    "c ' runs , and the calculation in work [ 20 ] ) gas of the circumbinary envelope tends to flow around the stream from above and from below .",
    "an illustration of this fact can be seen in fig .  8 where the density field and the velocity vectors in ` @xmath65'-plane passing through point @xmath66 are shown for ` c ' run .",
    "the change of density ( the increase in flow thickness ) in the region where gas of the circumbinary envelope interacts with the stream is also obvious in fig .",
    "9 represented the density field in frontal plane ( ` @xmath67'-plane ) for run ` c ' .",
    "the presence of the gas flowing around a stream may give the impression that shock interaction appears between the stream and the disk ( see , for example , the three - dimensional image of iso - density surface in fig .",
    "10 , and also the work [ 20 ] ) , though analysis of the solution unambiguously proves the smooth nature of this part of the flow .",
    "in our studies [ 16 ] we structured the flow patterns as follows :    * disk is the matter of stream that immediately captured by the accretor and then is accreted ; * circumbinary envelope is all the rest matter .",
    "the part of this matter revolves around the accretor , interacts with the stream and then can be accreted .",
    "thus , we divided the matter of stream by a physical attribute : if gas leaves the system or then interacts with the initial stream , we consider this matter as not belonged to the disk . in the solutions with small viscosity",
    "there was additional part of the envelope : the matter that flows around a stream from above and from below .",
    "analysis of the flowlines proves that this part of the envelope does not belong to the disk .",
    "the large part of this matter leaves the system or , rotating around the accretor gradually comes nearer to the equatorial plane and then it does collide with the flow .",
    "in addition to the definitions of works [ 16 ] , it is worthwhile introducing an additional term : the ` circumbinary halo ' describing the matter that : i ) revolves around the accretor ( it is gravitationally captured ) ; ii ) does not belong to the disk ; iii ) interacts with the stream ( collides or flows around from above and from below ) ; iv ) then , after interaction , it can be either involved in accretion or leaves the system .",
    "the change in numerical viscosity should inevitably result in the change of accretion rate .",
    "analysis of ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' runs , as it can be expected , proves that in the calculations with smaller viscosity the rate of accretion decreases .",
    "unfortunately , the detailed study of this question requires huge computing time that essentially exceeds the power of the computer used .",
    "the problem is that in the calculations with high viscosity that were presented in [ 16 ] the viscous time scale    @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the velocity of sound , @xmath70 is the characteristic thickness of a disk , exceeded the gas dynamical time scale for the disk    @xmath71 only slightly , that allowed one to reach the steady - state solution at the times of several orbital periods . at",
    "decreased viscosity the steady - state solution can hardly be obtained because restricted power of the computer used does not allow one to conduct the calculations for the periods of time larger than @xmath72 .",
    "analysis of ` c ' variant , i.e. the study of the mass of the disk and halo as functions of time , proves that the solution was not a steady - state even at the times larger than 15 orbital periods .",
    "obtained results of 3d numerical simulations of mass transfer in semidetached binaries demonstrate the absence of the ` hot spot ' in self - consistent solution .",
    "this conclusion was made when considering systems with large value of viscosity ( see [ 16 ] ) .",
    "presented calculations confirm that there is no shock interaction between the stream from @xmath0 and the forming accretion disk ( ` hot spot ' ) at any value of viscosity .",
    "analysis of obtained solutions shows that in the systems with various values of viscosity the stream from @xmath0 is deflected under the impact of gas of the circumbinary envelope and approaches to the disk at a tangent line , so does not cause shock disturbances of the edge of disk ( ` hot spot ' ) .",
    "the regions of superfluous energy release are located along the edge of stream facing towards the orbital motion .",
    "so we can conclude about the qualitative similarity of the flow structure for various values of viscosity . at the same time runs with low value of viscosity (",
    "when diffusion is weak and thickness of the stream is small ) reveal an important role of the gas of the circumbinary envelope that flows around the stream from above and from below .",
    "we have introduced an additional term to describe this feature of the flow structure : the ` circumbinary halo ' .",
