    "the state - of - the - art commercial pet scanners are based on inorganic scintillators as radiation detectors @xcite .",
    "this pet technology is expensive @xcite and therefore there are attempts to find a new , more affordable solutions as e.g. described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the j - pet group is developing a cost - effective whole - body positron emission tomography scanner based on plastic scintillators @xcite .",
    "the scanner , referred to as j - pet ( jagiellonian positron emission tomograph ) is built out of axially arranged plastic scintillator stripes , read out at both sides by photomultipliers @xcite .",
    "signals from photomultipliers are sampled in the voltage domain by the dedicated front - end electronics @xcite .",
    "based on the difference and the average of these signals it is possible to reconstruct both position and time of the gamma quantum interaction with scintillator , respectively .",
    "currently three reconstruction methods were developed by the j - pet group .",
    "one approach is to calculate the mahalanobis distances of the measured signal ( represented by the multivariate vector ) from the vectors based on the mean of the signals in data sets determined for known positions @xcite . in the second method the hit time and hit position",
    "are reconstructed based on the comparison of the measured signal probed in the voltage or time domains with the synchronized model signals @xcite .",
    "the third option is to train data set from a multivariate normal distribution based on the tikhonov regularization , where representation of signals was provided by the principal component analysis decomposition @xcite .",
    "all these three methods required data sets collected for know position of gamma interaction with scintillator .",
    "annihilation quanta were collimated with the usage of lead bricks with 1.3  mm slit .",
    "however , due to the finite slit length and the distance between collimator and the scintillator stripe , the precise determination of the beam profile was performed .",
    "for the first tests we have built two different collimation systems shown on fig .  1  and  2 . these setups consisted of hammamatsu r4998 photomultipliers @xcite , reference detector , lead bricks and bc-420 scintillators manufactured by saint - gobain @xcite .",
    "signals from photomultiplier were sampled in time domain by the lecroy sda6000a digital oscilloscope .",

    "for the second setup two scintillator stripes with photomultipliers attached to each end were placed parallel to each other .",
    "collimator ( built of lead cylinders ) with @xmath8na source was placed between them and was moved along the axis parallel to the two scintillator stripes .",
    "additionally , one or two lead bricks were placed between the source and one scintillator ( fig .  2 ) .",

    "the first prototype of j - pet which have a downscaled geometry of tomographs used in hospitals is build out of 24-modules ( scintillator stripe with pair of photomultipliers ) ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "this required a design of a new collimation system for the purposes of signal database measurements and any other studies of the detector response requiring well collimated beam @xcite . in order to find a proper dimensions of the lead cylinders providing the best beam collimation and low total weight of the collimator we have made simple calculations neglecting gamma quanta scattering .",
    "these calculations give also the first approximations of expected beam profiles for the new collimator .",
    "for better control over the systematic uncertainties of the beam profile determination we have developed three quantitatively different methods ( described in sections 3 - 5 ) . each method required specific configuration of an experimental setup presented in fig .  1 and fig",
    "first method allows to measure the cumulative function of the beam profile without modifying the beam itself . in method",

    "since the block size is much larger than the beam profile we assume that the lead block absorbs gamma quanta in the range from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , where @xmath27 denotes beginning of the block . in this case",

    "three methods of the beam profile determination were presented .",
    "first method allowed for the wider possible beam size estimation , second method contains the contribution from the gamma quanta that do not travel perpendicularly to the scintillator and the third method gives the estimation only for gamma quanta that travels perpendicularly to scintillator .",
    "results obtained with all the methods are consistent within statistical uncertainties and show that the beam profile has a gaussian shape with the fwhm equal to about 1  mm .",

    "is important but also weight and size of collimator system , therefore to choose optimal solution simulations of the beam profile for different sizes of collimator were performed .",
