    "supersymmetric extension of gravity ( supergravity ) , or local susy , predicts a spin-@xmath4 particle , the gravitino .",
    "when supersymmetry is spontaneously broken , the gravitino acquires a mass by absorbing a massless goldstino . in most of the supersymmetric models , susy is broken in a hidden sector .",
    "while the masses of superpartners of the standard model ( sm ) particles may depend on the mechanism to mediate susy breaking in the hidden sector , the gravitino mass is only described by the susy breaking scale , @xmath5 , and the planck scale , @xmath6 , as @xmath7 .",
    "discovery of the gravitino would be therefore one of the most direct ways to prove the nature of the hidden sector of the supersymmetric models .",
    "the rate of the direct production of a gravitino from particle collisions is small .",
    "if the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , it is produced from cascade decays of heavier sparticles , and its nature can be thus studied .",
    "the lsp gravitino is also cosmologically important .",
    "the reheating temperature after inflation is severely constrained by the ` overclosure ' problem @xcite .",
    "there have been , however , proposed several mechanisms which avoid this constraint and which , in addition , explain the cold dark matter density in terms of thermally produced lsp gravitinos @xcite .",
    "late time decays of next - to - lightest supersymmetric particles ( nlsps ) might change the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) if the lifetime is longer than o(1 ) sec @xcite , which leads to constraints on the masses of nlsp and gravitino @xcite , and parameters of supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "gravitino dark matter scenario may also be realized non - thermally , e.g. via nlsp decays @xcite or right - handed sneutrino decay @xcite .    in the lsp gravitino scenario ,",
    "the nlsp is metastable , and they escape detector before decaying into the gravitino . the nlsp is likely the scalar tau lepton @xmath0 ( stau ) , because the slepton masses receive smaller radiative corrections from gaugino masses than squarks , and the stau mass receives a larger yukawa correction than the other sleptons .",
    "the lighter mass eigenstate @xmath0 , which is a linear combination of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , becomes even lighter due to the left - right mixing .",

    "the gravitino mass can not be directly determined due to limited experimental resolutions , its mass , or susy breaking scale , can be estimated from the lifetime in the assumption that eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) is correct .",
    "furthermore , a study of a rare 3-body decay , @xmath25 , can reveal the peculiar form of the gravitino couplings , and may even determine the gravitino spin of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "previously , the determination of the charged nlsp ( cnlsp ) lifetime has been studied by many authors and it was found that the cnlsp decay is detectable for @xmath26 @xcite . in this paper , we study the possibility to measure the cnlsp lifetime and decay patterns for the case when it is long - lived so that the prompt decay inside the detector can be neglected . for the cnlsp with sufficiently slow velocity , it can be stopped in the stopper material placed outside the main detector after losing its energy from ionization in the main detector materials .",
    "then the lifetime of cnlsp thus stopped would be measured by detecting subsequent decay of the cnlsp in the stopper .",
    "the stopper needs to be a tracking detector to measure the stopping position and timing of the parent cnlsp and also the momenta , positions and timings of the charged particles and photons arising from the cnlsp decay .",
    "the requirements of the stopper detector are also discussed . such study , if possible at future colliders such as the lhc , will also reveal the important interactions that may affect the big bang nucleosynthesis in the early universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the requirements to study the cnlsp decay . in section 3 , we discuss a possible study of the cnlsp at the lhc ( atlas / cms ) @xcite . the velocity distribution of cnlsp ( @xmath27 ) at the lhc is shown at a sample point of the gauge mediation model @xcite , which is studied in the atlas technical design report .",
    "the number of cnlsps stopped in a o(1 ) kton stopper is estimated , and it is found to be as large as o(5000 ) events for an integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath28 and squark masses of @xmath29  gev .",
    "so that , one can determine a lifetime of the cnlsp of @xmath30 years or so , which corresponds to the susy breaking scale as large as o(@xmath1 )  gev , or gravitino mass of o(@xmath31 )  gev .",
    "here , we also discuss a possibility to make use of existing detector , taking soudan 2 as an example . in section 4 , we will study the case at proposed future linear colliders @xcite .",
    "the direct production of the cnlsp @xmath0 at a @xmath32 collider may not be efficient because the cross section is suppressed by @xmath33 , while one wants to keep @xmath27 relatively small so that cnlsp can be easily stopped .",
    "when the mass difference between @xmath34 and @xmath0 is small , an alternative option of @xmath35 collision at the @xmath36 threshold energy is more attractive , since the production cross section is only suppressed by @xmath37 .",
    "it is found that the number of the cnlsps stopped in the stopper could be as large as @xmath38 .",
    "if this is the case , one can study not only the lifetime of the cnlsp , but also the branching ratios and decay distributions of various cnlsp decay modes , including the rare decay modes .",
    "we first discuss how we could measure the lifetime of the cnlsp , which can be produced at collider experiments . the cnlsp would be metastable and long - lived .",
    "its lifetime @xmath39 might range from o(100 ) nsec to o(1000 ) years , depending on the cnlsp and gravitino masses .",
    "when @xmath40 is too long to decay frequently in the detector ( @xmath41 1000ns ) , its lifetime can not be measured directly at the main detector of collider experiments .",
    "however the cnlsps with low velocity lose their kinetic energy by ionization loss , since they are charged , and could be stopped at a massive stopper material , which can possibly be placed outside the main detector .",
    "a large number of the cnlsps thus stopped could be stored and accumulated in the stopper for a significantly long time period .",
    "the cnlsps then decay after @xmath42 .",
    "the stopper should be an active detector with good tracking capability to measure the lifetime of the cnlsp .",
    "first of all , it should measure the ionization per unit length @xmath43 to reject a @xmath44 track from that of signal cnlsp @xcite .",
    "the stopping timings @xmath45 and positions of all the cnlsp candidates are measured and recorded one by one , as well as the cnlsp decay time @xmath46 and its decay products .",
    "the lifetime of cnlsp is obtained from the distribution of a timing difference @xmath47 . in particular , to correspond the parent cnlsp and daughter decay products , the requirement that the decay products originate from the stopping position of the parent cnlsp is of crucial importance .",
    "therefore , the stopper has to have a sufficiently high position resolution , as well as a fine detector segmentation .",
    "the stopper should be massive so that as large number of cnlsps as possible can be stopped , of the order of o(1 ) @xmath48 o(10 ) kton .",
    "typically , we need to have , at least , o(10 ) cnlsps stop and decay / year inside the stopper detector to estimate the lifetime in accuracy of a few 10 % . when a huge number of cnlsps can be accumulated , the distributions of the decay products can be studied .",
    "the cnlsp is likely to be a @xmath0 and it decays into a @xmath49 lepton .",
    "the @xmath49 further decays into @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and so on . @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath55 further decay into @xmath52 and @xmath56 ( s ) , and momenta of the decay products are parallel .",
    "the decay distributions contain physics information .",
    "the stopper detector might have good calorimetric performance for them , then the gravitino mass can be calculated from the cnlsp mass and the tau energy , which is estimated from the end point of the tau jet energy distribution .",
    "the composition of the @xmath49 jet is also important .",
    "the tau lepton is generally polarized depending on the left - right mixing of @xmath0 , and the polarization of @xmath49 can be studied by measuring the @xmath57 ratio @xcite .",
    "in general , the @xmath58 is detected as an ionizing track starting from the decay point and it ends by interacting hadronically after penetrating @xmath59 g /@xmath60 . on the other hand , @xmath61 s are converted into em showers after one radiation length ( o(10)g/@xmath60 ) .",
    "ideally , the detector needs to be segmented into cells with a thickness less than o(10)g/@xmath60 to any direction , so that @xmath57 can be measured .    to estimate a suitable velocity ( @xmath62 ) of the cnlsp to stop , a range @xmath63 , which is a distance for a charged particle to penetrate before stopping , is evaluated based on the bethe - bloch equation . for the value of the @xmath62 of interest",
    ", the range @xmath63 is described by a function of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) with a mild dependence on types of the stopper material . for iron , @xmath66 g/(@xmath67gev ) is necessary for a particle with @xmath68 , @xmath69 g/(@xmath67gev ) for @xmath70 , and @xmath71 g/(@xmath67gev ) for @xmath72 @xcite , where @xmath73 is the mass of a charged particle .",
    "the cnlsp with @xmath74 needs to go through @xmath75 g/@xmath60 when @xmath76  gev .",
    "it is difficult to stop such relativistic particles , therefore we will concentrate on the cnlsps with slow velocity .    it is noted that most of the main detectors for collider experiments have significant thickness",
    ". typically thickness of the detector is around 10 absorption length @xmath77 for pseudo - rapidity , where @xmath78 is the angle from the beam direction . ]",
    "@xmath79 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they serve as a degrader to reduce kinetic energy of the cnlsps before reaching the stopper .",
    "some of the cnlsps also stopped inside the detector , however , those stopped inside the detectors can not be used to study their decay unless the detectors are significantly modified . while most of those cnlsps will stop in the calorimeter , the granularity of the hadronic calorimeters might not be fine and positions where they stopped are not precisely determined .. in the radial direction , it is segmented into ( only ) three layers . ]",
    "it is then not obvious to reject an activity in the calorimeter from the cosmic ray events .",
    "furthermore , those detectors take data only at the time of collisions .",
    "the decay of the particles with a lifetime longer than the bunch spacing will not be tagged .    in the next subsequent sections ,",
    "the velocity distribution of the cnlsps and the number of the cnlsps stopped in the stopper are estimated , together with accuracy of lifetime measurement , for the lhc and future linear colliders separately .",
    "at the lhc , the cnlsp can be produced from cascade decays of squarks @xmath80 and gluinos @xmath81 .",
    "the production cross section is sensitive to the squark and gluino masses .",
    "if @xmath82  gev ( 1tev ) , @xmath83  pb and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) cnlsp will be produced for @xmath86  fb@xmath28 .",
    "for the case where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are as heavy as @xmath48 2@xmath483tev , one may still search for the cnlsps model independently from their direct productions which is discussed in @xcite , however , the study of the cnlsp decays will be limited statistically .",
    "therefore we concentrate on the case where cnlsps are produced dominantly from @xmath80 and @xmath81 decays .    a case where the nlsp is a charged slepton is studied in paper @xcite at a gauge mediation model point g2b keeping other gauge mediation parameter ,",

    "[ fig - betastau ] shows the velocity distributions of the produced @xmath206 at the rest frame of @xmath188 , for @xmath203 and @xmath208 . in this frame , @xmath206 are produced isotropically .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - betastau ] , there are interesting differences between @xmath191 and @xmath190 .",
    "first of all , the ratio of @xmath209 events increases for larger @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "this is because the @xmath210 mode picks up the bino mass in the propagators ( chirality flipped ) , while the other mode does not . secondly , one can see that @xmath190 distribution has a peak at larger velocity than @xmath191 .",
    "now we can calculate the ( @xmath211 , @xmath62 ) distributions of @xmath206 at the laboratory frame by combining the angular distribution of @xmath188 with the energy distributions of @xmath206 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - betastau ] .",

    ", we have normalized the total number of events so that it corresponds to integrated luminosity @xmath213 .",
    "one can see that the @xmath191 distribution has a sharper peak at @xmath214 than @xmath190 .",
    "this is because @xmath191 has typically smaller velocity than @xmath190 at the rest frame of @xmath188 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - betastau ] .    finally , we estimate the total number of @xmath206s which are stopped at a material . here , as examples , we assume @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 of iron placed at the region @xmath218 . for @xmath208 , they can stop staus with velocities @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we have counted the number of events in these regions , for the parameter set used in fig .",

    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     given the weight of stopping material , one can tune the beam energy , thereby the selectron velocity @xmath187 , to maximize the obtained number of staus .",
    "we again assume that the total thickness which particle has to go through within the lc detector is about 1000g/@xmath124 .",
    "the optimal velocity is @xmath222 for the stopper of the thickness 2000 g/@xmath124 , when @xmath223 cnlsps can be stopped in the stopper of @xmath224 for 10  fb@xmath28 . for integrated luminosity @xmath225 ( corresponding to 250 days for @xmath35 luminosity in @xcite ) and a 10kton stopper ,",
    "the total number of the cnlsp is therefore @xmath226 for the present parameter set .    to illustrate the model dependence , let us consider another example , @xmath227 gev , where the masses are close to these for g2b point .",
    "this case is better than the previous one in several aspects .",
    "first of all , smaller @xmath228 and @xmath200 lead to a larger production cross section of @xmath34 .",
    "secondly , smaller @xmath176 means shorter range @xmath63 for a fixed velocity @xmath62 . finally , because of the small mass difference between @xmath228 and @xmath176 , @xmath0",
    "s velocity has a very narrow distribution , @xmath229 .",
    "assuming again @xmath215 thickness of the lc detector at @xmath79 , a @xmath215 stopper will be sufficient to stop cnlsps with velocity @xmath230 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath231 , all the generated @xmath0s ( @xmath232 ) at @xmath79 will be stopped with a 12.6@xmath233kton stopper .",
    "we found that the total number of collected @xmath0 is @xmath234 for integrated luminosity @xmath225 .",
    "note that we have assumed a @xmath215 stopper , and hence a wider area is covered for a fixed weight @xmath130 than the previous cases . for a 1kton stopper , roughly ten times more cnlsps can be collected than eq.([natg2b ] ) .",
    "so far we have assumed the thickness of the lc detector is uniform for @xmath235 .",
    "ideally , given the masses @xmath228 and @xmath176 , the total weight of the stopper @xmath130 and the profile of the collider detector , one can optimize the shape ( thickness ) of the stopper and the electron beam energy in order to maximize the collected number of cnlsps .    with the above number of stopped cnlsp , one can measure the susy breaking scale from the lifetime very precisely .",
    "in addition , the mass of gravitino would be measured directly from the measurement of the upper end of the @xmath49 jet energy from the cnlsp decays .",
    "the end point is expressed as @xmath236 .",
    "if the error of energy scale of the @xmath49 jet @xmath237 is @xmath238 , a gravitino mass of @xmath239 @xmath240 can be measured .",
    "for example , for @xmath241  gev and @xmath242  gev  , the tau energy is 72  gev .",
    "if it is measured within @xmath243 , gravitino mass will be determined as @xmath244 ( 1639 )  gev .",
    "the lifetime @xmath245 days and the mass @xmath176 will be measured much more accurately .",
    "notably this leads to a measurement of planck scale @xmath246 ( 1.94.6)@xmath247  gev by using eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) .",
    "we found that there might be o@xmath248 events available for the cnlsp study if @xmath35 linear collider can produce @xmath36 near the threshold and @xmath3 decays into a cnlsp which is close to @xmath3 in mass .",
    "when the lifetime of the gravitino is order of a year or less , all of the stopped cnlsp decay will be observed , and about 1% of them decay through its rare decay mode such as @xmath249 .    in paper @xcite , the importance to study such rare decay modes is discussed .",
    "the decay into gravitino is induced by the interaction    @xmath250 + ( l \\leftrightarrow r)\\,.\\ ] ]    in the limit of very large gaugino masses , the 3 body decay proceeds through the photon emission from the any of the charged external lines of the decay @xmath251 , or the 4 point photon - gravitino - tau - stau interactions .",
    "the peculiarity of the stau decay into the gravitino compared to those by ordinary yukawa type interaction may be seen more clearly in the limit @xmath252 when the helicity 1/2 component dominates the gravitino interaction , because the wave function of @xmath253 components will be enhanced proportional to its energy .",
    "indeed it is reasonable to assume this limit for the rare mode study , because the cnlsp lifetime should not be too much larger than o(year ) to make a full use of the all stopped cnlsps .",
    "this means the gravitino mass can not be comparable to the stau mass , in that case lifetime easily exceeds o(year ) .    in the limit @xmath252 ,",
    "the @xmath0 decay then may be governed by the effective interaction of goldstino @xmath254 where @xmath255 , @xmath256 \\tilde{\\gamma}f_{\\mu\\nu}.   \\label{eff}\\ ] ] the first term is yukawa type interaction and renormalizable , while the last term ( photon - photino - gravitino interaction ) is a non - renormalizable one .",
    "the photon - photino - gravitino interaction contributes to the cnlsp decay through the photino exchange .",
    "the last term manifests itself in the three body decay distribution of gravitinos , and may be extracted from the study of the decay distribution .",
    "the difference between the decay pattern of the gravitino to some fermion , which comes from a non - renormalizable terms , may be studied by measuring the photon energy and angle between photon and @xmath49 @xcite . for the type of the drift tube detector discussed in the previous section",
    ", the angle between the tau jets and photon would be measured precisely .",
    "the energy resolution , on the other hand , would be around 10% event by event .",
    "the statistical significance of the measurement of the effective couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) at a future linear collider will be studied elsewhere .    before closing this section ,",
    "let us compare the cases of @xmath183 and @xmath35 colliders . as noted before , the production cross sections @xmath257",
    "are suppressed by @xmath258 compared to @xmath259 , where @xmath260 , @xmath90 , @xmath89 .",
    "quantitatively , they are even more suppressed .",
    "we have numerically checked that @xmath261 and @xmath262 for @xmath263 , for both of the above examples @xmath264 and @xmath265 . even for unpolarized electron beam ,",
    "the ratios are less than 0.037 .",
    "on the other hand , the luminosity of a @xmath35 collider becomes smaller than @xmath183 due to the de - focusing effect of the same charge beams .",
    "it is found in ref .",
    "@xcite that , assuming identical beam parameters , the luminosity of @xmath35 mode is seven times smaller than the @xmath183 mode",
    ". therefore , @xmath35 mode can produce at least four times more low velocity cnlsp staus than @xmath183 , per time .",
    "another possibility is a @xmath266 pair production at @xmath183 collider , at the threshold @xmath267 .",
    "although @xmath268 is suppressed by @xmath269 , @xmath270 is suppressed only by @xmath62 . in the limit of @xmath271 and @xmath272",
    ", @xmath273 is eight times smaller than @xmath274 , because of the bino coupling ( @xmath275 ) , absence of @xmath276-channel ( @xmath275 ) and non - identical final states ( @xmath277 ) .",
    "this factor offsets the advantage of the luminosity . besides",
    ", @xmath278 is typically heavier than @xmath89 by o(1 ) factor .",
    "this leads to additional suppression of the cross section @xmath279 by a factor of @xmath280 .",
    "a cnlsp generated by @xmath278 is too rapid to stop in the stopper , resulting in another suppression of factor @xmath281 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath35 option is still likely advantageous to the @xmath183 option .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the possibility to study the charged nlsp ( cnlsp ) @xmath107 decaying into the lsp gravitino at future collider experiments such as the lhc or @xmath183/@xmath35 linear colliders .",
    "o@xmath282 ( lhc ) to o@xmath248 ( lc ) cnlsp may be stopped if a 1 kton stopper is placed close to the detectors at the interaction point for the case where sparticle masses are close to the current experimental limits .",
    "a cnlsp lifetime up to @xmath283 years will be accessible when @xmath284 cnlsps are stopped in the stopper , because more than 10 cnlsps decay inside the detector / year in that case .",
    "if the cnlsp production rate is low and their lifetime is too long , the signal to background ratio could be problematical .",
    "in such a serious case , we might be forced to do detection only during beam - off period , with cost of lower detection efficiency .",
    "detail estimation of the signal to background ratio needs further simulations with realistic detector design and experimental situations .    for o@xmath248 cnlsps , one can study the rare decays of the cnlsp .",
    "it should be noted that not only the gravitino - cnlsp interaction , but also all the other exotic interactions involving cnlsp can be investigated by collecting metastable cnlsp .    in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where the long - lived charged particle is the cnlsp @xmath0 .",
    "stable gluino scenario @xcite or split susy scenario where the gluino lifetime is long because of superheavy sfermions @xcite predict a hadronic charged stable or meta - stable particle .",
    "they may also be stopped by a massive stopper detector . in the case of split susy scenario ,",
    "the gluino lifetime depends on the superheavy sfermion mass scale",
    ". however , the number of stopped gluinos would be significantly smaller than those expected for the case where @xmath285  gev studied in this paper , because the stopping range increases proportional to the masses .",
    "the physics that can be extracted from the lifetime measurement is rich .",
    "one can determine the scale of the hidden sector susy breaking by measuring the nlsp lifetime @xmath286 .",
    "this restricts the possible susy breaking scenario strongly .",
    "the direct information on the nlsp lifetime also constrains the possible cosmological scenario .",
    "if the nlsp lifetime is longer than o@xmath287 sec , the decay of nlsp may change the abundances of the light elements of nuclei in the early universe , so that the upper limit on the number density at the time of nlsp decay in the early universe would be obtained @xcite .",
    "this in turn severely restricts the parameters of supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "if the cnlsp turns out to be long - lived , high priority must be given to the study of the cnlsp lifetime so that the measurement can be done during the high luminosity run of the lhc .",
    "suitable 1kton detectors exist already for proton decay searches / neutrino detector now , and we discussed the soudan 2 detector as an example .",
    "it is important to keep these detectors after their original physics target is achieved by the time when the physics results at the low luminosity run is obtained at the lhc .",
    "after this paper appeared in e - print archive , feng and smith also submitted a paper  @xcite on the number of slepton that would be trapped at the stopper near the lhc and lc .",
    "they consider the possibility to place a water tank outside the main detector , then drain the water to a reservoir in low background environment .",
    "this perhaps is not useful for the nlsp with lifetime much shorter than draining period .",
