    "our own theoretical modeling of the relative peak intensities agrees with the experimental results with the notable exception of the @xmath19 transition .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the limited experimental characterization of the dissociation process .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies on possible dissociation pathways from the 2@xmath1 state are necessary to resolve this conflict .",
    "one possibility is that the theoretical calculations are off by 800 @xmath20 , but this seems unlikely for such a simple molecule .",
    "another solution is the dissociation process involves excitation to the 2@xmath21 state followed by photon emission back to an excited vibrational 1@xmath21 state before photodissociation .",
    "alternatively , the dissociation could be due to predissociation @xcite from the 2@xmath22 state to the 1@xmath22 state , but we expect this rate to be slower than fluorescence . in order to unravel these possible pathways , one can look for laser - induced fluourescence when driving these vibronic transitions and also design experiments to measure the electronic state of the dissociated ca@xmath2 .",
    "we plan to extend our measurement technique to the measurement of rovibronic lines in cah@xmath5 by narrowing the spectrum of our laser source .",
    "the measurement of rotational lines is vital for testing the preparation of the molecular ions in their rotational ground state using optical pumping methods .",
    "this internal state control , combined with our previous realization of the ground state cooling of axial modes of molecular motion @xcite , will facilitate the implementation of quantum logic spectroscopy on cah@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , our experimental method can be used to measure the rovibronic spectrum of other alkali - earth monohydride ions with the appropriate laser - cooling ion , as well as the deuterated forms of these molecules .",
    "regarding state preparation , some optical pumping schemes for rotational cooling will require a good knowledge of the rovibrational spectrum for the ground electronic state . by using a 1 + 2 resonance enhanced multi - photon dissociation scheme , it is possible to measure the fundamental rovibrational transitions in the 1@xmath1 state by sweeping the frequency of the first photon from a 6.9 @xmath13 m laser .",
    "the second photon would excite to one of the 2@xmath1 vibrational states , and the third photon would dissociate the molecules @xcite .",
