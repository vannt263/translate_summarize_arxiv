    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the ir galaxy number count model on which our subsequent discussions are based .",
    "we also formulate the source confusion limit and optimal survey area to suppress both the fluctuation caused by the source clustering , and the poisson shot noise by the sparseness of the sources . in section  [ sec : result ] we show the galaxy number counts at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths and extensively examine how galaxy evolution and formation epoch affect the number counts .",
    "we also discuss the optimal strategy of a survey at these wavelength to obtain the maximal information on galaxy evolution and formation .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to our summary and conclusions .",
    "the galaxy number count model is represented by galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , luminosity function ( lf ) , cosmology , and galaxy evolution .",
    "we briefly review the number count model by takeuchi et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter t01 ) . based on this model , we calculate galaxy number counts with various galaxy evolution histories in the subsequent part of this paper .",
    "the fir sed is constructed based on the _ iras _",

    "1987 ; soifer & neugebauer 1991 ) , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the detected flux density at wavelength @xmath21 [ @xmath12 m ] , and @xmath22 [ @xmath23 is the intrinsic luminosity evaluated at @xmath24-@xmath12 m , @xmath25 .",
    "this relation is converted to the dust temperature @xmath26@xmath22 relation , then the modified blackbody continuum with the corresponding @xmath26 are calculated .",
    "we then added the mid - ir and radio continuum spectrum based on the empirical correlations between fluxes in these wavelengths and fir continuum .",
    "the final seds that we use in our number count and cirb models are presented in figure  [ fig : sed ] . for the full description of the sed construction ,",

    "( 1987 ) is adopted as the local ir lf of galaxies and pure luminosity evolution is assumed in this study .",
    "thus the 60-@xmath12 m luminosity of a galaxy at redshift @xmath27 is described by @xmath28 we also assumed that the luminosity evolution is ` universal ' , i.e.   its functional form is fixed . in this paper we call @xmath29 ` the evolutionary factor ' as in t01 .    using the above formulae",
    ", we calculate the galaxy number counts .",
    "as we see later , we set the maximum redshift we consider the counts of galaxies into the calculation , @xmath30 and we vary it from @xmath31 to @xmath32 to investigate the effect of @xmath33 on the number counts .",
    "t01 statistically estimated the permitted range of the evolutionary factor from the observed ir number counts and the cirb spectrum .",
    "the evolutionary factor is directly connected to the evolution of the cosmic ir luminosity density , which is closely related to the cosmic star formation history ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the conversion from the ir luminosity to the star formation rate and the interpretation of the evolutionary factor to the cosmic star formation history are discussed in t01 . in this paper",
    "we examine how the number counts at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths vary with different evolutions , based on the two representative evolutions from t01 ( we call them evolution 1 , and 2 in this paper ) .    the model of t01 has been constructed based on the properties of ir galaxies , and it slightly underestimates the submillimeter source counts . therefore in this study",
    ", we use an additional model based on the scuba source counts .",
    "the additional evolution model overestimates the cirb spectrum , but the possibility of reconciling the cirb and submillimeter number counts is discussed in takeuchi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; therefore , we do not go into the details of this problem further .",

    "these three evolutions are summarized in figure  [ fig : evlp ] .",
    "[ fig : evlp ]      we summarize the framework of the source confusion statistics and derive the source confusion limit .",
    "the basic formulation of the source confusion was first discussed by scheuer ( 1957 ) . the formula for the confusion limit for power - law number counts",
    "was formulated in the classical work of condon ( 1974 ) , and extended for the case of general number counts by franceschini et al .",
    "( 1989 ) .    in this subsection",
    ", we briefly re - formulate these issues and examine the formulae carefully for precise numerical calculations .",
    "the original formulation of scheuer ( 1957 ) was rather complex , so we use a simper but modern theory of random summation ( e.g. , gnedenko & korolev 1996 ) to clarify the mathematical structure of the problem .",
    "first we define a differential number count per @xmath34 with flux @xmath35 $ ] , @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the cumulative number count . as a radio telescope scan across the sky",
    ", the antenna temperature fluctuates due to many confusing sources passing through the beam .",
    "let @xmath39 be the beam pattern ( normalized to unity at the beam center ) , and @xmath40 , the response of the telescope to a source of flux density @xmath41 located at an angular position @xmath42 from the beam axis .",
    "the mean number of source responses of intensity @xmath43 in a beam is @xmath44 the amplitude of the total signal at any point , @xmath45 , is a randomly - stopped sum of the responses @xmath43 due to all the sources in the response pattern : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total number of contributing sources .",
    "we should note that @xmath47 randomly varies and takes an integer value .",
    "the mean number of @xmath43 s , @xmath48 , is @xmath49 the probability that the total number of @xmath43 s has a value @xmath50 is given by a poisson distribution @xmath51 we have the ( cumulative ) distribution function ( d.f . ) of @xmath43 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 then the d.f .  of a signal @xmath45 with @xmath50 summands",
    "is @xmath54 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : poisson ] ) , ( [ eq : dfx ] ) , ( [ eq : dfx_conv ] ) , and ( [ eq : dfx_init ] ) , we obtain the d.f .  of @xmath45 , @xmath55 : @xmath56 the characteristic function ( c.f . ) of @xmath55 , @xmath57 , is expressed by the c.f .  of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , as @xmath60 recall that @xmath61 , then we have @xmath62 the expectation value and variance of a randomly - stopped sum @xmath45 are known to be @xmath63 ( e.g. , stuart & ord 1994 ) where @xmath64 and @xmath65 represent the expectation and variance , respectively .",
    "thus we have @xmath66      we next formulate the relation between the beam size @xmath67 and the source confusion limit .",
    "hereafter we assume that @xmath68 .",
    "a general case without this assumption is considered by condon ( 1974 ) , but the result is not substantially affected by the above simplification .",
    "first we discuss the case that the number count is described by a power - law : @xmath69 then we have @xmath70 the mean number of @xmath43 , @xmath71 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is @xmath74 here we consider the gaussian beam pattern : @xmath75 we note that more complex beam patterns can be taken into account .",
    "other beam patterns have been commented upon by e.g. , scheuer ( 1957 ) and franceschini et al .",
    "but in a real situation , the result does not depend on the details of the beam pattern , and a gaussian beam can be used as a representative case . in equation  ( [ eq : gaussian_beam ] ) ,",
    "@xmath67 is the fwhm of the beam and relates to the standard deviation of the gaussian , @xmath76 , through @xmath77 .",
    "we assume that the beam area on the sky is small enough that the solid angle can be integrated on a plane . then condon ( 1974 ) derived the effective beam size as @xmath78 @xmath79 . in the third step we set @xmath80 .",
    "we obtain the confusion limit flux to a cutoff deflection @xmath81 : @xmath82 and thus @xmath83 as usually defined , if we set @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 thus we obtain the important expression for the case of a power - law number count , @xmath86 for the gaussian beam pattern , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : confusion_for_power ] ) and ( [ eq : omega_eff_gaussian ] ) lead to @xmath87 this formula is used very frequently , probably because it is expressed in a simple analytic function . however",
    ", we should note that this derivation includes a mathematical flaw because @xmath88 is integrated from 0 to @xmath89 , even though @xmath88 must be small .",
    "fortunately , the above integration converges , but when we generalize the form of the number counts , it diverges , as we discuss below .",
    "therefore we should set a certain cutoff in the integration in the real calculation .",
    "thus , the confusion limit given by equation  ( [ eq : confusion_for_power_gauss ] ) is too pessimistic .",
    "we now turn to formulate the confusion limit for the general number counts ( franceschini et al .",

    "the result strongly depends on the value of the cutoff . just as in the above discussion",
    ", we set @xmath93 , so @xmath94 thus , we obtain a general relation between the beam size and the confusion limit as @xmath95      next we formulate the calculation for the necessary sky area of the survey for the studies of galaxy evolution . in order to estimate the effects of galaxy evolution from survey data , a significant sky area should be scanned to suppress the variation in the galaxy surface number density . since galaxies are clustered on the sky , the nominal error bar estimated from the assumption of poisson statistics",
    "is an underestimate , and we must take the galaxy angular correlation function into account . barcons ( 1992 ) considered the effect of clustering in his fluctuation analysis . despite its importance , this problem is often overlooked in the literature on deep surveys . at the faintest fluxes ,",
    "this additional effect is gradually diluted by the projection along the line of sight .",
    "we formulate the effect in the following .",
    "consider a survey area @xmath96 and divide it into small cells @xmath97 so that the number of galaxies in the cell @xmath97 , @xmath98 or 1 .",
    "we set the mean galaxy surface number density @xmath99 .",
    "then we have a mean number in a solid - angle cell @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 by definition , we have @xmath103 .",
    "we observe @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the angular two - point correlation function of galaxies .",
    "next we consider the number of galaxies @xmath106 in the survey area @xmath96 .",
    "we have @xmath107 and thus @xmath108 if we assume that we take sufficiently wide area whose dimension is much larger than the coherent scale of angular clustering , we can approximate the above expression as @xmath109 here we evaluate the ` signal - to - noise ratio ' of the number counts @xmath110 : @xmath111 the approximation used in the third step can be adopted when @xmath112 is sufficiently large . we see that the @xmath110 depends on the angular correlation strength and the solid angle of the survey and is almost independent of the surface density of the sources @xmath99 .",
    "this fact shows that , in order to determine galaxy evolution from number counts , large - area surveys are required .",
    "the angular correlation function of the _ iras _  galaxies is @xmath113 ( @xmath114 : lahav , nemiroff , & piran 1990 ) .",
    "we assume that the submillimeter sources and the faint radio sources have the same clustering properties as  galaxies . but",
    "even if we observe the same species of galaxies as the  galaxies , an ir galaxy appears to be bright at fir but faint at submillimeter ; therefore , we should assume their seds and convert the correlation function",
    ". for the relatively bright radio sources , a steeper clustering power - law exponent @xmath115 has been reported by cress et al .",
    "the angular correlation of galaxies out to a fainter flux limit is obtained by using the scaling relation of @xmath105 with a detection limit through the relativistic limber s equation ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "using this formula , in section  [ subsec : int_z ] we estimate the minimum survey area required for a sufficient @xmath110 .",

    "that the slope of the number counts is very steep , the source confusion limit will not be drastically improved even with a much better angular resolution . since the slope of the submillimeter counts is steep in the brighter flux regime and gets flatter towards the fainter fluxes , the confusion limit becomes lower quickly if the beam size ( fwhm ) becomes small .    in the submillimeter regime",
    ", we see that scuba ( @xmath119 ) deep surveys are nearly confusion - limited .",
    "recently hogg ( 2000 ) pointed out that if the number count slope is steep , i.e. , @xmath120 , the information of faint sources can be completely destroyed by the confusion effect .",

    "they also showed from their simulations that 19 % of their scuba sources have positional errors greater than 6 arcsec .",
    "therefore , we should be quite cautious of the fluxes or positions of the faintest submillimeter sources .",
    "considering this point , we can obtain the flux safely for sources brighter than @xmath121  mjy . in the next subsection",
    ", we see that a reliable survey at brighter fluxes is crucially important for the study of galaxy evolution .",
    "the large - area submillimeter survey of sources brighter than 10  mjy by the aste is suitable for this purpose .    on the other hand , the high angular resolution of the alma / lmsa results in a very low confusion limit of @xmath122jy .",
    "thus , we can estimate the flux and position of such faint sources very precisely . since the slope of the number counts of millimeter sources becomes flatter at such faint fluxes , improving the angular resolution provides a drastically better confusion limit .",
    "[ fig : confusion ]      in order to derive information on evolution at @xmath123 from submillimeter source counts , we modify the evolutionary factor and examine how the number counts vary with the modification .",
    "we show the evolutionary factors used here in the top panel of figure  [ fig : evlp ] .",
    "the thick solid step function is evolution  1 itself .",
    "we first modify evolution  1 so that the evolutionary factor at @xmath124 is @xmath125 .",
    "secondly we set the evolutionary factor at @xmath124 to be @xmath126 .",
    "the resulting number counts are shown in figure  [ fig : nc_level ] .",
    "the effect of the different evolutions at @xmath124 is clearly seen in the bright end of the number counts in figure  [ fig : nc_level ] .",
    "however an important problem arises here . for measuring the number counts in such a bright flux regime ,",
    "a very large - area sky survey is required .",
    "since the number density of the sources is so small and the statistical fluctuations are large , secure determination of the counts is difficult .",
    "[ fig : nc_level ]    the necessary sky area is estimated by using the formulation presented in section  [ subsec : area ] .",
    "the characteristic depth of a survey is defined by the survey flux limit , @xmath127 . as we mentioned in section  [ subsec : area ] , we here assume that the submillimeter sources brighter than 100  mjy are clustered as strongly as the  sources brighter than 0.7  jy , which have the angular correlation function @xmath128 .",
    "we define the relative characteristic depth of a survey by @xmath129/s_{\\rm lim}\\;[\\mbox{jy}])^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "then , the angular clustering @xmath105 is scaled as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the angular correlation function of the survey whose flux limit is 0.1  jy . under the assumptions mentioned above , the clustering of the submillimeter sources is expressed as @xmath132 the signal - to - noise ratio defined in section  [ subsec : area ] becomes @xmath133 and we obtain @xmath134 in the left panel of figure  [ fig : area ] we show the area  limiting flux relation derived directly from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sn ] ) and ( [ eq : relcor ] ) .",
    "in fact , the equation is well approximated by @xmath135 the above approximation is valid as long as the fluctuation by clustering dominates the variance . since recent observations of the submillimeter number counts suggest strong galaxy evolution ( section  [ sec : introduction ] ) , the number counts increase rapidly toward fainter fluxes .",
    "consequently , the poisson fluctuation is small as compared with the clustering variance and the condition for the approximation is satisfied . thus , the relation presented in figure  [ fig : area ] is well represented by equation  ( [ eq : approxslim ] ) .",
    "we can also estimate the relative observation time to perform such a survey by multiplying @xmath136 by the obtained sky area @xmath137 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the relative observation time is roughly proportional to @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , the fainter the limiting flux , the shorter the required observation time .",
    "this is presented in the right panel of figure  [ fig : area ] .",
    "but actually , as we discussed above , we can not make the flux limit too faint ( @xmath139  mjy ) because of severe source confusion .",
    "if we adopt @xmath140 , the required survey area is @xmath141 at 10  mjy , which is large but not unreasonable for a present - day submillimeter survey .",
    "if @xmath142 , then the survey area is @xmath143 at 50  mjy .",

    ", we will be able to estimate the angular clustering properties of the submillimeter sources .",
    "if the variance of the detected source counts are different than what we assumed , then it provides important quantitative information on the clustering evolution of dusty galaxies .",
    "we stress that this will be another important purpose of this survey .",
    "[ fig : area ]      we next adopt three other cases for the evolutionary factor @xmath29 to examine the effect of the galaxy formation epoch on the number counts at submillimeter and radio wavelengths .",
    "first we use the evolutionary histories based on evolution  2 , and vary the the cutoff redshifts as @xmath145 , 3 , 5 , and 7 .",
    "we note that this cutoff redshift represents the epoch of the formation or appearance of the dusty galaxies , and does not necessarily imply the formation of all species of galaxies .",
    "in addition , we also study the case of submillimeter - based evolution  3 , introduced in section  [ subsec : nc ] .",
    "for the modified evolutionary histories based on the evolution  3 , the redshift cutoff are also set to be @xmath145 , 3 , 5 , and 7 .",
    "the resulting number counts with various redshift cutoffs are shown in figure  [ fig : nc_zmax ] .",
    "the top two panels present the number counts at 850  @xmath12 m and 1.3  mm with evolution 2 .",
    "the bottom tow panels show the number counts with evolution 3 .",
    "the effect of the cutoff is clearly seen in the faintest end of the number counts in these two panels . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : nc_zmax ] ,",
    "the effect of redshift cutoff is more prominent than in the top panel .",
    "in contrast to the case discussed in section  [ subsec : int_z ] , a very deep detection limit is required to investigate the redshift cutoff , i.e. , the galaxy formation epoch .",
    "the extremely deep survey by alma / lmsa is a unique opportunity for this purpose . at such a faint flux level",
    ", the variance of the number count is diluted by the large source surface density and the source projection ; we can , therefore , distinguish between the predictions of different models presented in figure  [ fig : nc_zmax ] .",
    "when we discuss such a deep flux limit , the dynamic range of a detector should be taken into account .",
    "if a very bright source exists in the field of view , the faintest sources near the detection limit can not be detected in the field .",
    "we evaluated the probability that the sources @xmath4 times brighter than the @xmath2-detection limit of the lmsa and alma exist in a field of view .",
    "the field of view of the lmsa observation is 20-arcsec diameter circular area ( @xmath146 sr ) .",
    "the number density of the sources @xmath4 times brighter than the @xmath2 limit at each waveband , @xmath106 , is directly obtained from figure  [ fig : nc ] . for example , @xmath106 of the alma at @xmath147 m is @xmath148 .",
    "then we obtain the expectation value of the number of very bright sources compared with the detection limit found in the field of view , @xmath149 . by using this value",
    ", we can treat the probability of finding @xmath50 bright sources in the field as a poisson process @xmath150 then the probability that more than one source exist in the field of view is @xmath151 even in the worst case of the alma ( when we use evolution  3 ) the probability is @xmath152 .",
    "thus , the probability that a very bright radio source lies in the field of view is so small that we do not have to worry about the dynamic range , and we can safely obtain the information of very distant faint sources .",
    "[ fig : nc_zmax ]      determination of source redshifts is an important but quite challenging issue in cosmological studies .",
    "information on source redshifts enables us to construct the lf as a function of redshift .",
    "we here assume the lf shape to be unchanged during evolution , but this is a strong assumption which should be tested with observational data .",
    "spectroscopic observations will be extremely difficult or almost impossible on very distant objects , and alternative methods are necessary . in the optical wavelength ,",
    "photometric redshift technique has provided a breakthrough for further studies of ultra high - redshift objects ( e.g. , fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1999 ) .    on the other hand , at longer wavelengths such as the far - ir ( fir ) or submillimeter it is harder to estimate source redshifts because of the smooth nature of their seds .",
    "takeuchi et al . ( 1999 ) tried to estimate redshifts roughly from fir photometry and found a practical possibility .",
    "carilli & yun ( 1999 ) proposed the radio - to - submillimeter spectral index as a redshift indicator for star - forming galaxies .",
    "they used the correlation between the fir flux from the thermal dust and the radio flux from the synchrotron emission from the interstellar matter and supernova remnants , and utilized the spectral index between the two kinds of emission as a function of redshift .",
    "though the radio - to - submillimeter index method is now often used to estimate the redshift of submillimeter sources , the origin of the two components of radiation is substantially different .",
    "if we can estimate the redshift of the sources from the ratio of two or more flux densities which have the same physical origin , it will be undoubtedly the most desirable method .",
    "we here develop such a method which is an extension of the attempt of takeuchi et al .",
    "we use fir and submillimeter / millimeter flux densities for this purpose .",
    "for the fir database , we suppose the wideband photometric catalog of the astro - f fir all - sky survey . at fir to submillimeter wavelengths",
    ", continuum emission is dominated by blackbody radiation from the big dust grains in equilibrium with the ambient ultraviolet radiation field .",
    "thus , the flux densities in this wavelength range are radiated from the same emission mechanism .",
    "first we show the redshifted sed of an infrared galaxy with luminosities @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 at redshift @xmath156 , and 5.0 in figure  [ fig : redshiftsed ] .",
    "the @xmath2-detection limits of astro - f and lmsa are also shown .",
    "the problem is that the peak of the blackbody radiation shifts not only with redshift but also with dust temperature @xmath26 . therefore , this method suffers from this degeneracy .",
    "is it useless as a redshift estimator ? in order to clarify this point , we present the detected flux densities and flux density ratios of star - forming galaxies as a function of redshift in figure  [ fig : dust_zc ] .",
    "the top two panels are the flux ",
    "redshift relations at @xmath157 m and @xmath158 m .",
    "the horizontal dotted line in the top - left and top - right panels depicts the detection limit at each wavelength .",
    "the middle and bottom panels present the color  redshift relations .",
    "submillimeter colors are a strong function of redshift , and we expect that they work well as rough redshift indicators .",
    "[ fig : redshiftsed ]    but the ambiguity is of order unity and is too large for , e.g. , estimating the shape evolution of the source lf .",
    "here we can use some additional information .",
    "we use the empirical relation between fir luminosities of galaxies and the flux ratio @xmath159 ( equation  ( [ eq : color_flux ] ) ) when we construct the sed model .",
    "therefore when we obtain the flux ratio of a source , we can estimate the luminosity @xmath160 .",
    "then we compare the estimated flux density @xmath161 with the detected flux density at the corresponding wavelength .",
    "if the two flux densities are significantly different , we correct the assumed @xmath26 and repeat this trial . thus we can obtain the redshift estimation by an iterative procedure .",
    "galaxies do not degenerate in the color  color ",
    "flux three - dimensional space ( figure  [ fig : dust_cf ] ) , and we safely use this method .",
    "we call this _ the dust-@xmath27 method_.    in order to examine the accuracy of the dust-@xmath27 method , we performed a series of monte carlo simulations .",
    "we assumed the following observational wavebands : 60 , 90 , 170 , 450 , 850 , 1300 , and 3000  @xmath12 m .",
    "the errors in flux measurements are set to be 5  % and 30  % .",
    "we input the assumed seds and added random errors to them , and calculate their ` observed ' fluxes .",

    "the result of the simulation is presented in figure  [ fig : dustz_sim ] .",
    "we show the estimates for galaxies with input luminosity @xmath162 , and @xmath163 .",
    "the input redshifts of galaxies are fixed to 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 5.0 .",
    "we examined two representative cases where the errors are @xmath164  % and @xmath165  % . in these simulations",
    ", we calculated 100 realizations for each redshift and luminosity .",
    "we conclude that if the error in each band is @xmath164  % ( i.e.  @xmath166 ) , then the redshift can be successfully estimated by the dust-@xmath27 method . even in case",
    "the error is @xmath165  % , the uncertainty in the estimation is comparable or even better than some other presently used indirect methods for redshift estimation ( cf .",
    "rengarajan & takeuchi 2001 ) .",
    "[ fig : dust_zc ]    we also evaluate the uncertainty in the adopted seds . taking the error in equation  ( [ eq : color_flux ] ) into account",
    ", we assess the error of @xmath167  % in luminosity estimation .",
    "the luminosity of galaxies in the fir is well approximated by @xmath168 , hence the error in temperature estimation is at most @xmath169  % .",
    "the peak frequency , @xmath170 , obeys the wien displacement law : @xmath171 .",
    "thus , the error associated with the uncertainty in sed templates is evaluated as @xmath121  % .",
    "this method works effectively when we have many photometric bands or channels .",
    "therefore , instruments that have a large number of wavebands are very useful for this purpose .",
    "this method provides us not only the redshift information but also the dust temperature of the submillimeter sources at the same time .",
    "this will surely be a strong constraint on the star formation history of galaxies .",

    "jy we see an excess of 1.4-ghz sources compared with our model calculations .",
    "the excess component mainly consists of radio galaxies that are dominated by ellipticals and are not directly related to the star formation in galaxies .",
