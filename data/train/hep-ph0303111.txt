    "a broad class of processes at high energies has properties analogous to the classical pattern of the diffraction of light .",
    "these are usually called diffractive processes .",
    "the classic example is the elastic scattering of hadrons on nuclei , which has an angular distribution with a series of minima and maxima , analogous to the diffraction of light on a black disc . in diffractive processes the wave nature of particles is clearly revealed and the necessity of a quantum mechanical description in terms of amplitudes , and not probabilities , is evident .",
    "unitarity relates the imaginary parts of forward elastic scattering amplitudes to total cross sections .",
    "hence studies of elastic scattering and @xmath7 for different targets and projectiles was traditionally one of important source of information on the strengths of interactions and their radii .",
    "in particular , data on the high - energy interactions of hadrons indicate that the radius of the strong interaction increases with energy , and indicate that the total cross sections will continue to increase in the energy region not explored at present accelerators .",
    "processes of diffractive dissociation of colliding particles  @xcite provide new possibilities for the investigation of the dynamics of high - energy hadronic interactions .",
    "these processes are dominated by soft , nonpertubative aspects of qcd , and hence provide important information on the dynamics .",
    "indeed , they provide a rich testing ground for models of soft interactions . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the cross sections of inelastic diffractive processes are very sensitive to nonlinear , unitarity effects .    a new class of diffractive phenomena ",
    "hard diffraction  has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically in recent years .",
    "these processes include the total cross section and diffractive dissociation of a virtual photon at high energy at hera , and the diffractive production of jets , @xmath8  bosons , heavy quarks , etc . in hadronic collisions .",
    "the latter processes become possible at very high ( c.m . )",
    "energies ( @xmath9 ) because _ large _ mass @xmath10 diffractive states may be produced with @xmath11 .",
    "investigation of these processes gives new possibilities for the study of the interplay of soft and hard dynamics in qcd .",
    "an important question  the breaking of qcd factorization for hard reactions in diffractive processes  will be discussed below .    nowadays diffractive hard processes are attracting attention as a way of extending the physics programme at proton colliders , including novel ways of searching for new physics , see , for example , @xcite@xcite and references therein .",
    "an especially interesting process is the exclusive double diffractive production of a higgs boson at the lhc ; @xmath12 , where the @xmath13 signs denote the presence of large rapidity gaps .",
    "clearly a careful treatment of both the _ soft _ and _ hard _ qcd effects is crucial for the reliability of the theoretical predictions for these diffractive processes .    the outline of the article is as follows . in section  [ sec : theor ]",
    "we review diffraction phenomena from both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channel viewpoints . in section  2.3",
    "we link these approaches together .",
    "we emphasize the convenience of working in terms of diffractive eigenstates , as originally proposed by good and walker  @xcite . in section  3",
    "we discuss how these eigenstates may be identified with the different parton configurations of the proton . scattering through each of the eigenstates is suppressed ( by unitarity or multi - pomeron effects ) by different amounts . in section  4",
    "we study some examples of hard diffractive processes .",
    "first we summarize a calculation of diffractive dijet production at the tevatron , which shows that the estimate of the overall suppression of the cross section is in agreement with the data . in section  4.2",
    "we turn to diffractive proton  nuclear processes .",
    "we present predictions for a range of hard diffractive processes which are accessible at rhic .",
    "finally , section  5 contains some brief conclusions .",
    "since this article is an attempt at a short review of high energy diffractive phenomena , we have only provided a few references to help the reader .",
    "hence our reference list is incomplete and we apologize to those authors whose work has not been cited .",
    "section  4 contains new results for diffractive proton  nuclear processes .",
    "the investigation of the diffractive scattering of hadrons gives important information on the structure of hadrons and on their interaction mechanisms .",
    "diffractive processes may be studied from either an @xmath0 channel or @xmath1 channel viewpoint .",
    "we will discuss these approaches in turn , and then show that they are complementary to , and consistent with , each other .",
    "unitarity plays a pivotal role in diffractive processes .",
    "the total cross section is intimately related to the elastic scattering amplitude and the scattering into inelastic final states via @xmath0  channel unitarity , @xmath14 , or  t t - t^= it^t [ eq : disct]with @xmath15 .",
    "if we were to focus , for example , on elastic unitarity , then disc would simply denote the discontinuity of @xmath16 across the two - particle @xmath0 channel cut . at high energies ,",
    "@xmath0  channel unitarity relation is diagonal in the impact parameter , @xmath17 , basis , such that 2 imt_el(s , b ) =    _ el & = & d^2b|t_el(s , b)|^2 + _ inel & = & d^2b . the general solution of ( [ eq : a1 ] ) is t_el & = & i(1-e^2i ) [ eq : elastamp ] + g_inel & = & 1-^2 , [ eq : gensol ] where @xmath18 is the probability that no inelastic scattering occurs .",
    "@xmath19 is called the opacity ( optical density ) or eikonal is called the eikonal . ] .",
    "the well known example of scattering by a black disc , with @xmath20 for @xmath21 , gives @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "in general , we see that the absorption of the initial wave due to the existence of many inelastic channels leads , via @xmath0  channel unitarity , to diffractive elastic scattering .",
    "so much for elastic diffraction .",
    "now we turn to inelastic diffraction , which is a consequence of the _ internal structure _ of hadrons .",
    "this is simplest to describe at high energies , where the lifetimes of the hadronic fluctuations are large , @xmath24 , and during these time intervals the corresponding fock states can be considered as ` frozen ' .",
    "each hadronic constituent can undergo scattering and thus destroy the coherence of the fluctuations . as a consequence",
    ", the outgoing superposition of states will be different from the incident particle , and will most likely contain multiparticle states , so we will have _ inelastic _ , as well as elastic , diffraction .    to discuss inelastic diffraction , it is convenient to follow good and walker  @xcite , and to introduce states @xmath25 which diagonalize the @xmath16 matrix .",
    "such eigenstates only undergo elastic scattering . since there are no off - diagonal transitions",
    "_ j|t|_k= 0  jk a state @xmath26 can not diffractively dissociate in a state @xmath27 .",
    "we have noted that this is not true for hadronic states due to their internal structure .",
    "one way of proceeding is to enlarge the set of intermediate states , from just the single elastic channel , and to introduce a multichannel eikonal .",
    "we will consider such an example below , but first let us express the cross section in terms of the probabilities @xmath28 of the hadronic process proceeding via the various diffractive eigenstates @xmath25 .",
    "let us denote the orthogonal matrix which diagonalizes @xmath29 by @xmath30 , so that [ eq : a3 ] imt = afa^t _ j |f| _ k = f_k",
    "_ jk . now consider the diffractive dissociation of an arbitrary incoming state [ eq : a4 ] | i = _ k a_ik | _ k .",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude for this state satisfies [ eq : a5 ] i |im  t| i = _ k |a_ik|^2",
    "f_k = f , where @xmath31 and where the brackets of @xmath32 mean that we take the average of @xmath33 over the initial probability distribution of diffractive eigenstates . after the diffractive scattering described by @xmath34 ,",
    "the final state @xmath35 will , in general , be a different superposition of eigenstates from that of @xmath36 , which was shown in  ( [ eq : a4 ] ) . at high energies we may neglect the real parts of the diffractive amplitudes .",
    "then , for cross sections at a given impact parameter @xmath17 , we have [ eq : a6 ] & = & 2 i |t| i = 2 _ k |a_ik|^2 f_k = 2 f + & & + & = & | i |t| i |^2 = ( _ k |a_ik|^2 f_k ) ^2 = f ^2 + & & + & = & _ k | _ k |t| i |^2 = _ k",
    "|a_ik|^2 f_k^2 = f^2 .",
    "it follows that the cross section for the single diffractive dissociation of a proton , [ eq : a7 ] = f^2 - f ^2 , is given by the statistical dispersion in the absorption probabilities of the diffractive eigenstates . here",
    "the average is taken over the components @xmath26 of the incoming proton which dissociates .",
    "if the averages are taken over the components of both of the incoming particles , then ( [ eq : a7 ] ) is the sum of the cross section for single and double dissociation .",
    "note that if all the components @xmath25 of the incoming diffractive state @xmath36 were absorbed equally then the diffracted superposition would be proportional to the incident one and the inelastic diffraction would be zero . thus if , at very high energies , the amplitudes @xmath28 at small impact parameters are equal to the black disk limit , @xmath37 , then diffractive production will be equal to zero in this impact parameter domain and so will only occur in the peripheral @xmath17 region .",
    "such behaviour already takes place in @xmath38 ( and @xmath39 ) interactions at tevatron energies .",
    "hence the impact parameter structure of inelastic and elastic diffraction is drastically different in the presence of strong @xmath0 channel unitarity effects .    under the assumption that amplitudes @xmath28 at high energies",
    "can not exceed the black disk limit , @xmath40 , equations  ( [ eq : a6 ] ) lead to the following bound [ eq : pb ] , known as the pumplin bound  @xcite .",
    "a simple realistic application of the above framework is the interaction of a highly virtual photon with a nucleus .",
    "for recent discussions and references see , for example ,  @xcite . the wave function for the photon to fluctuate into a @xmath41 pair",
    "may be written @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the separation of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the transverse plane and @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the longitudinal momentum fractions of the photon momentum carried by the @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for small @xmath48 the cross section for the @xmath41 pair to interact with",
    "a nucleon behaves as @xmath49 .",
    "thus , at fixed impact parameter @xmath17 , the opacity  =  t_a(b )  r^2 [ eq : opacity ] where t_a(b )  =  _ -^dz(b , z ) [ eq : opticaldensity ] and @xmath50 is the density of nucleons in the nucleus ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "@xmath52 is often called the nuclear density per unit area or the optical thickness of the nucleus .    at high energy , due to lorentz time dilation ,",
    "the lifetime of each component with fixed @xmath43 is much longer than the interaction time of the @xmath41 pair inside the nucleus @xmath53 .",
    "hence the @xmath54 amplitude is of the form fluctuation of the photon . ]",
    "1-e^-/2  =  d^2r d^*(r,)(r , ) .",
    "[ eq : gammastara ] on the other hand , at low energy , where the lifetime of the @xmath41 fluctuations is small , we have to average @xmath55 already in the exponent , since each nucleon interacts with a different @xmath56 fluctuation .",
    "therefore the low energy amplitude is 1 - ( -/2 )  =  1 - ( -t_a/2 ) .",
    "[ eq : lowenergyamplitude ] to simplify the discussion we , here , neglect the real part of the elastic amplitude ; that is we assume in ( [ eq : elastamp ] ) that @xmath57 .",
    "modulo this assumption , ( [ eq : lowenergyamplitude ] ) is exactly the glauber formula , which was originally derived for an incoming particle of energy @xmath58  gev , which therefore has enough time to return to its equilibrium state between interactions within the nucleus .",
    "it is this normal mix of fock states of the incident particle which leads to taking @xmath59 in the exponent .",
    "returning to the high energy case , we see that as the separation @xmath43 is frozen , each value of @xmath48 corresponds to a diffractive eigenstate @xmath60 ( in the notation of ( [ eq : a4 ] ) ) with cross section @xmath61 .",
    "if there is a large probability of inelastic scattering , that is @xmath62 , then the difference between ( [ eq : gammastara ] ) and ( [ eq : lowenergyamplitude ] ) is significant , and leads to a large diffraction dissociation cross section @xmath63 of ( [ eq : a7 ] ) .    in the above example we are dealing with a continuous set of diffractive eigenstates",
    "@xmath60 , each characterised by a different value of @xmath43 .",
    "another example is to consider just two diffractive channels  @xcite@xcite ( say , @xmath64 ) , and assume , for simplicity , that the elastic scattering amplitudes for these two channels are equal .",
    "then the @xmath16 matrix has the form [ eq : a8 ] i m  t = 1 - e^- /2 , where the eikonal matrix @xmath65 has elements [ eq : a9 ] _ f^i^^fi = _ 0 ^fi _ f^i^. the individual @xmath66 matrices , which correspond to transitions from the two incoming hadrons , each have the form [ eq : b9 ] = (    cc 1 & + & 1    ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath67 determines the ratio of the inelastic to elastic transitions .",
    "the overall coupling @xmath68 is also a function of the energy @xmath9 and the impact parameter @xmath17 .",
    "it is assumed here that the diagonal elements for both channels are equal .",
    "this leads to a simplification of the formulas .    with the above form of @xmath66 , the diffractive eigenstates are [ eq : c9 ] | _ 1 = ( | p + | n^ * ) , | _ 2 = ( | p - | n^ * ) . in this basis",

    "one of the eigenvalues is small .",
    "as was mentioned above , in qcd the diagonal states are related to the colourless @xmath41 states with definite transverse size , @xmath48 .",
    "small eigenvalues correspond to the states of small size ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "thus the @xmath0  channel view of diffraction is convenient to incorporate @xmath0  channel unitarity .",
    "however it needs extra dynamical input to predict the @xmath0 and @xmath17  dependences of the different diffractive processes .",
    "the @xmath1 channel approach is based on the regge model for diffractive processes . in this approach",
    "diffractive processes are mediated by the exchange of a pomeron ( @xmath73 )  the leading regge pole with vacuum quantum numbers ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the pomeron plays the role of an exchanged ` particle ' , and gives factorizable contributions to scattering amplitudes .",
    "diffractive processes ( fig .  1 ) are characterized by a large rapidity gap between groups of produced particles .    for example",
    ", for the ( single ) diffractive dissociation of particle  2 into a system of mass @xmath10 , the rapidity gap between particle @xmath74 and the remaining hadrons is y = ( ) = ( ) , [ eq : delta y ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the feynman @xmath77 variable of particle @xmath78 . in general",
    ", the masses , @xmath79 , of the diffractively excited states , produced in high energy @xmath80 collisions , can be large .",
    "the only condition for diffractive dissociation is @xmath81 .    in the regge pole model , the cross section for the inclusive single diffractive dissociation process of fig .",
    "1(a ) can be written in the form x_p  = |g_p(y , t)|^2_p2^tot(m^2,t ) [ eq : diffcross ] where @xmath1 is the ( square ) of the 4-momentum transfer .",
    "the green s function ( propagator ) of the pomeron is g_p(y , t)=s , [ eq : green ] where = is the signature factor .",
    "the quantity @xmath82 can be considered as the pomeron ",
    "particle  2 total interaction cross section  @xcite .",
    "this quantity is not directly observable .",
    "it is defined by its relation to the diffraction production cross section , ( [ eq : diffcross ] ) .",
    "this definition is useful , however , because at large @xmath83 , this cross section has the same regge behavior as the usual total cross sections _",

    "thus , in this region where the dissociating system has a large mass @xmath10 , satisfying @xmath85 , the inclusive diffractive cross section is described by the triple - regge diagrams of fig .  2 .",
    "therefore , on inserting ( [ eq : p2crosssection ] ) into ( [ eq : diffcross ] ) , we have = _ k _ k(t)(1-x)^_k(0)-2_p(t ) ( ) ^_k(0)-1 .",
    "[ eq : large_s2_diffcross ] the pomeron and @xmath86 couplings to the proton , and the triple - regge vertices @xmath87 , have been determined from analyses of experimental data on the diffractive production of particles in hadronic collisions ( see the review in  @xcite ) . these couplings",
    "specify the factors @xmath88 in ( [ eq : large_s2_diffcross ] ) .",
    "in impact - parameter space , regge amplitudes have a gaussian form at asymptotic energies .",
    "on the other hand , for inelastic diffraction we expect a peripheral form , which follows from unitarity in the @xmath0  channel picture .",
    "note also that , since the pomeron has intercept @xmath89 , the cross sections of diffractive processes , ( [ eq : large_s2_diffcross ] ) , increase with energy faster than the total cross sections , and thus lead to a problem with unitarity .",
    "however , in regge theory it is necessary to take into account , not only regge poles , but also regge cuts  @xcite , which correspond to the exchange of several regge poles in the @xmath1  channel .",
    "these contributions restore the unitarity of the theory . for inelastic diffraction",
    "they lead to a peripheral form of the impact - parameter distributions and yield the appropriate energy dependence of the corresponding cross sections .",
    "how is this realized in regge theory ?",
    "the explanation is based on a technique to evaluate reggeon diagrams , introduced by gribov  @xcite , which allows the calculation of contributions of multi - pomeron cuts in terms of pomeron exchanges in the amplitudes of diffractive processes .",
    "gribov s technique uses unitarity and analyticity of reggeon  particle amplitudes , which follows from an analysis of feynman diagrams  @xcite .",
    "for example the amplitude of two - pomeron exchange in the @xmath1  channel ( fig .",
    "3a ) can be written as a sum over all diffractive intermediate states in the @xmath0  channel ( fig .",
    "this result can be extended to multi - pomeron exchanges in the @xmath1  channel . for the single ( @xmath0 ) channel case",
    ", the summation of all elastic rescatterings leads to the well known eikonal formula with eikonal given by fourier transform of the single - pomeron - exchange diagram . for several diffractive channels",
    "the resulting amplitudes can be written in the matrix eikonal form of the type shown in ( [ eq : a8 ] ) and ( [ eq : a9 ] ) . in this way",
    "a connection between the @xmath0  channel view of diffraction and regge theory is established .",
    "note that only for weak coupling can the pomeron cuts be neglected , and just the first term in the expansion be retained .",
    "another powerful tool for the calculation of , not only diffractive , but inelastic processes , which contribute to total cross section , is the agk ( abramovsky , gribov , kancheli  @xcite ) cutting rules . by applying these rules ,",
    "it is possible to show the selfconsistency of the approach , which was absent in the pure regge pole model .",
    "consider a diagram where elastic scattering is mediated by the exchange of @xmath26 pomerons .",
    "the agk cutting rules specify the coefficients @xmath90 arising when @xmath91 of these pomerons are cut .",
    "recall that these pomeron cut discontinuities give the corresponding inelastic contributions to @xmath7 .",
    "the terms with @xmath92 correspond to the diffractive cutting of the diagram ( that is the cut is between the pomeron exchanges , and not through the pomerons themselves ) .",
    "these @xmath92 terms have the coefficients c_k^n=0 = 2^k-1 - 1 .",
    "[ eq : coeffs ] for two - pomeron exchange , @xmath93 , the coefficients are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 according to whether @xmath92 , 1 or 2 pomerons are cut , respectively .",
    "we illustrate the compatibility between the @xmath0  channel view of diffraction and the @xmath1  channel approach with multi - pomeron cuts , using a simple example with two diffractive channels . in this case",
    "the @xmath16  matrix has the form ( [ eq : a8])([eq : b9 ] ) with function @xmath68 given by [ eq : omega_0 ] _ 0 = e^-b^2/4b  =  ( ( ) - ) , where @xmath97 is the slope of the pomeron amplitude , [ eq : a18 ] b = b_0 + _ p^ ( s / s_0 ) , @xmath98 is the coupling of the pomeron to the proton , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . in practice , the value of @xmath70 is about 0.4 .",
    "thus as a first approximation we may neglect higher powers of @xmath70 in ( [ eq : a8 ] ) .",

    "this example illustrates the general difference in the suppression of the elastic and inelastic channels due to multi - pomeron exchanges , in agreement with @xmath0  channel unitarity .",
    "let us illustrate the self consistency of the gribov technique for the evaluation of multi - pomeron contributions , and the agk cutting rules , in the simplest single - channel example .",

    "note that this self consistency could not be achieved if the series in multi - pomeron rescatterings would be cut at some finite term .",
    "the consistency with @xmath0  channel unitarity can be proven for an arbitrary multichannel case .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the situation with two pomeron poles : soft @xmath110 and hard @xmath111 . in the single channel case ,",
    "a summation of @xmath0  channel rescatterings leads again to the eikonal formula @xcite with [ eq:21 ] ( s , b)=_s(s , b)+_h(s , b ) where the @xmath112 are the fourier transforms of the @xmath113-pomeron contributions .",
    "the hard pomeron is usually related to the cross section of minijet production  @xcite , which rapidly increases with energy .",
    "it is interesting to note that the unitarization via eikonal formula described above leads to a rather weak influence of the hard component on the behaviour of the total cross sections , because this component becomes important only at energies when the soft component is large and the amplitudes at small impact parameters are close to the black disk limit . from the agk cutting rules it is easy to prove that in this model , the cross section of a hard process ( with any number @xmath114 of hard interactions plus any number of soft inelastic interactions ) is described by the eikonal expression with @xmath115 .",

    "it was emphasized above , that at very high energies when elastic scattering becomes close to the black disk limit , there is a strong influence of different diffractive eigenstates on the properties of diffractive processes in the physical ( hadronic ) basis . in particular , there is a strong reduction of the cross section of large mass diffraction due to unitarity ( multi - pomeron rescatterings ) effects . below we will consider these effects for the diffractive production of large mass states , which contain a hard subprocess : the so - called hard diffractive processes",
    "the hard diffractive dissociation of hadrons or nuclei provides new possibilities for the investigation of diffraction dynamics .",
    "we illustrate this by discussing some typical reactions below .",
    "first , we describe a study of diffractive dijet production at the tevatron , and then we proceed to make predictions for typical hard diffractive processes in proton  nuclear collisions that are accessible at rhic . the possible relevance to diffraction at the lhc",
    "is mentioned .",
    "consider first the situation for dijet production in @xmath38 ( @xmath121 ) collisions .",
    "it is important that the single pomeron exchange diagram of fig .",
    "4(a ) can be calculated using qcd factorization for the hard processes , together with the distributions of partons in the proton and the pomeron , denoted by @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively .",
    "the latter ` diffractive ' distributions can be extracted from an analysis of hard diffraction in deep inelastic scattering ( fig .",

    "i , kf_p(x_p , t)f_i^p(,e_t^2)f_k^p(x_1,e_t^2)_ikddx_1 [ eq : c1 ] where @xmath125 is the cross section for dijet production by partons with longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath126 and @xmath127 of the proton and pomeron respectively , and @xmath128 is the transverse energy of the jets .",
    "@xmath129 is the pomeron `` flux factor '' , which , according to ( [ eq : diffcross ] ) , can be written in the form f_p(x_p , t ) = .",
    "[ eq : c2 ] this approximation corresponds to the ingelman  schlein conjecture  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a hard scale provides the normalization of the pomeron term .    in the previous sections we have emphasized the importance of multi - pomeron contributions for diffractive particle production . for diffractive dijet production they correspond to the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "these diagrams lead to a strong violation of both regge and hard factorization .",
    "experimental data of cdf collaboration at the tevatron  @xcite clearly indicate the breaking of hard factorization in dijet production  the measured dijet cross section is an order of magnitude smaller than that predicted from ( [ eq : c1 ] ) using hera data for @xmath124 .",
    "it is even more striking that the @xmath127 distribution for the produced dijets increases much faster as @xmath130 , as compared with the expected behaviour of the partonic distributions .",
    "both experimental observations can be reproduced in the model which takes into account the suppression of diffractive production at high energies due to multi - pomeron exchanges .",
    "an essential feature of the model , which allows the reconciliation of the observed @xmath127 dependence with that expected from the partonic ( mostly gluonic ) distributions , is the relation between the size of the partonic fluctuation and the type ( or the value of @xmath77 ) of the active parton .",
    "the suppression factor @xmath131 in this model can be written in the form to distinguish the suppression @xmath131 in @xmath38 ( or @xmath121 ) hard diffractive collisions from the extra suppression @xmath132 in @xmath133-nuclear collisions to be discussed in sections  4.2 and 4.3 . ]",

    "it can depend on the type of the active parton @xmath113 and the value of its momentum , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite two eigenchannels were considered , @xmath140 .",
    "it was argued that the channel with the smaller cross section ( denoted the @xmath141 component ) corresponds to valence quarks with @xmath142 , while the channel with the larger cross section is due to sea quarks and gluons and is concentrated at smaller values of @xmath77 .",
    "this was denoted _ model  a _ of the diffractive eigenstates .",

    "we use a more realistic parameterization of the @xmath147 , determined from the global description of total , elastic and soft diffractive production data  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the two - channel eikonal allowing for low mass diffraction , this analysis incorporated pion - loop insertions in the pomeron trajectory , and high mass single- and double - diffractive dissociation via @xmath0 channel iterations of diagrams containing the triple - pomeron interaction .",
    "interestingly , the order of magnitude suppression and the @xmath127 dependence of the prediction of the cdf dijet was well reproduced by both models  a and b for the diffractive eigenstate , see fig .",

    "here @xmath159 , where the cross sections are for proton  nucleon scattering at energy @xmath80 through the @xmath158 eigenstate , since elastic scattering does not change the kinematic structure of the process .",
    "thus the nuclear suppression factor ( sometimes called _ nuclear transparency _ ) is s_a^incoh  =  , [ eq : p4 ] where the denominator @xmath160 is the corresponding cross section for the diffractive production of the hard ( massive ) system @xmath148 in proton  nucleon collisions .",
    "thus @xmath161 is the _ extra _ suppression due solely to _ nuclear _ effects .    coherent production on nuclei , process ( [ eq : p2 ] ) , is possible when the mass of the diffractively produced system , @xmath162 , satisfies m^2/s  1/m_p r_a,[eq : p5 ] where @xmath80 is the proton  nucleon c.m . energy .",

    "to be specific , we use a factorization scale @xmath169 where for drell  yan or @xmath166 production the mass of the pair is chosen to be @xmath170  gev , while for beauty production we take @xmath171  gev .",
    "the nuclear profile function , @xmath52 of ( [ eq : opticaldensity ] ) , was calculated using the standard woods ",
    "saxon form for @xmath172 with the parameters determined from the electromagnetic form factors of nuclei  @xcite . in figs .  8 , 9 we show the nuclear suppression factors ( [ eq : p4 ] ) and ( [ eq : p8 ] ) as a function of the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the incoming proton carried by the system @xmath148 ( @xmath173 , @xmath166 or @xmath167 ) .    figs .  8 and 9",
    "correspond to nuclei with @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively .",
    "we see that , in general , the suppression due to nuclear effects is approximately a factor of 10 for @xmath176 and a factor of 100 for @xmath177 . the dashed lines in figs .  8 and 9 correspond to the predictions of the one - channel eikonal model , which obviously can not represent the different partonic configurations participating in the process .",
    "it therefore does not depend on the specific diffractively produced system @xmath148 or the momentum fraction @xmath77 that it carries .",
    "the other curves are the predictions of the two different two - channel eikonals introduced in section 4.1  the simple model  a , which predicts the dotted curves , in which the valence quarks and the gluon + sea quarks are respectively associated with the small and large size diffractive eigenstates , @xmath178 and @xmath179 of ( [ eq : c4 ] ) ; and model  b , which predicts the continuous curves , with a more realistic partonic composition of the diffractive eigenstates .    for models",
    "a and b , we see that , in general , the nuclear suppression depends on @xmath77 . for large @xmath77 , where the small - size , low @xmath180 component dominates , the suppression is less than that expected in the pure glauber one - channel case with @xmath181 . on the other hand , for smaller @xmath77 , where more contribution comes from the large - size , higher @xmath180 component ,",
    "there is much more suppression .",
    "however , for charm ( and beauty ) production , model  a predicts that the suppression is independent of @xmath77 .",
    "the reason is that the gluons have all been assigned to a single component ; moreover , as this component has @xmath182 , the suppression is larger than the single - channel prediction . in the more realistic model , model  b , where the gluon is distributed between both eigenstates ,",
    "the suppression is less and the @xmath122 cross section larger , and moreover depends on @xmath77  the large @xmath77 gluons are concentrated in the diffractive eigenstate with the small @xmath180 . on the other hand ,",
    "drell  yan production originates from valence and sea quark annihilation and hence the difference between the predictions of models  a and b is small .    in fig .",
    "9 we include the prediction for the nuclear suppression in diffractive @xmath167 , as well as @xmath166 , production .",
    "the only difference is that the scale is larger : @xmath183  gev rather than 5  gev . by comparing @xmath166 and @xmath167 production",
    "we see the results are not sensitive to the choice of scale . in fig .",
    "10 we present the @xmath53  dependence for the more realistic model  b , for a large and a small value of @xmath77 .",
    "the above examples demonstrate the role that diffractive eigenstates ( with different absorptive cross sections ) play in the description of diffractive processes involving nuclei . in comparison with the over - simple single - channel glauber approach ,",
    "the nuclear suppression factors reveal an informative rich structure .",
    "they vary by more than a factor of two for the various hard diffractive processes .",
    "figures 810 are qualitatively valid for all energies .",
    "the suppression factors of nuclear origin , @xmath132 , decrease only gradually with increasing energy due to the slow growth of @xmath184 .",
    "moreover , these nuclear shadowing effects for the interactions of protons with nuclei are similar and @xmath38 collisions , and in the increase of the radius of the interaction with energy . ] to the suppression factors in proton  proton interactions at much higher energies  @xcite .",
    "( recall that for both @xmath122 and @xmath38 collisions we refer to the proton  proton energy @xmath80 . ) for instance , we see from fig .  8 that the nuclear suppression factor in @xmath133-copper collisions is @xmath185 at rhic energies of @xmath186  gev , which is comparable to the suppression @xmath131 in hard diffractive @xmath38 collisions at the higher tevatron energy , see for example , fig .  6 .",
    "this interesting correlation may be anticipated from the dependence of @xmath132 of ( [ eq : p3 ] ) and ( [ eq : p4 ] ) on the exponential of the product @xmath187 .",
    "total cross sections increase with energy as @xmath188 with @xmath189 , while @xmath190 .",
    "thus an increase of @xmath0 by two orders of magnitude is equivalent to an increase in @xmath53 by a factor @xmath191 .",
    "thus , since @xmath132 for @xmath122 collisions with @xmath192 at rhic energies is comparable to @xmath131 for @xmath38 collisions at the tevatron ( @xmath193@xmath194 ) , we expect that @xmath131 at the lhc ( @xmath195 ) will be close to @xmath132 for @xmath122 collisions with @xmath196 ( see fig .",
    "so the observation of shadowing of hard diffractive processes on heavy nuclei at rhic may serve as a guide to the size of the suppression factors @xmath131 which occur in similar processes in @xmath38 collisions at the lhc energy .",
    "of course , the @xmath131 factors can be calculated directly , but confirmation from a study of proton  nuclear scattering data at rhic would be valuable .",
    "the @xmath131 factors need to be known , for example , in plans to identify new physics phenomena in observations of such diffractive processes at the lhc .",
    "investigation of both soft and hard diffractive processes provides important information on the dynamics of strong interactions at high energies . with increasing energy the role of unitarity effects ( which , in the reggeon approach , materialise as multi - pomeron exchange interactions ) becomes more and more important .",
    "the association of eigenstates of the diffractive part of the @xmath16-matrix with definite partonic configurations leads to extra insight into the dynamics of diffractive processes in qcd .",
    "it allows one to determine the effective sizes of the partonic configurations in hard diffractive processes .",
    "the use of nuclear targets provides new possibilities for detailed studies of various aspects of both soft and hard diffractive processes .",
