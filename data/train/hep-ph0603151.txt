    "generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas ) @xcite are important nonperturbative objects for understanding how quarks and gluons form hadrons in hard exclusive processes .",
    "they describe the soft transition @xmath14 or @xmath15 , in the kinematical regime where the invariant mass of the hadron pair @xmath16 is small compared to the hard scale of the process . the typical processes to which the gdas formalism can be applied are the two photon process @xmath17  @xcite and hadron pair eletroproduction @xmath18@xcite , for which factorization theorems have been proved  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we gave an analysis of the process @xmath19 at the @xmath3-pole energy , with small pion pair invariant mass .",
    "the subprocess @xmath20 can be factorized into the convolution of a hard coefficient and the generalized distribution amplitude of two pions ( 2-pion gda ) . in the case of charged pion pair production ,",
    "the process is sensitive to the @xmath8-odd parts of 2-pion gdas , and provide an opportunity to access them in @xmath2 annihilation . in this work",
    "we extend the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite to a generalized process @xmath21 , in the kinematical region where @xmath1 is large but much below the @xmath3-pole . like the case of the production through @xmath3 boson analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a similar factorization holds for the case of the production through a virtual photon , which gives the dominant contribution for neutral pion pair production in the kinematical region we discuss here .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the process @xmath22 can provide detailed information about 2-pion gdas , especially their @xmath8-even part .",
    "we also discuss the @xmath9 interference term , which contains the weak mixing angle @xmath23 and can be used as an alternative approach to extract its value . the bremsstrahlung process @xmath24 dominates in the case of charged pion production , and its interference with @xmath12 is a valuable tool for studying the process @xmath25 at the amplitude level .",
    "we first study the subprocess of pion pair production @xmath27 in the framework of gdas .",
    "it is convenient to investigate this subprocess in the pion pair center of mass frame ( shown in fig .",
    "[ kine]a ) , where the kinematics is expressed as ( choosing the @xmath28 axis along the momentum of the real photon ) @xmath29 respectively . here",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are two lightlike vectors which satisfy : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the invariant mass of the pion pair and @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the total momentum of the pion pair .",
    "the skewness parameter @xmath37 is the momentum fraction of plus momentum carried by @xmath38 with respect to the pion pair : @xmath39    in the kinematical region @xmath40 , the process given in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) can be analyzed in the framework of gdas , which has been applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case where the virtual photon is replaced by the @xmath3 boson at @xmath41 . from fig .",
    "[ pionpair]a and the one with the two photon vertices interchanged , the hadronic tensor of the process can be calculated as  @xcite @xmath42 which has the same form as that of the two photon process  @xcite , and @xmath43 is the gda defined as  @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the momentum fraction of the quark with respect to the hadronic system .    as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , a useful constraint on the gdas comes from charge conjugation invariance of the strong interactions : @xmath46 following this constraint one can define the @xmath8-even and @xmath8-odd parts ( in @xcite they are also called isoscalar and isovector parts respectively ) of 2-pion gda as  @xcite @xmath47,\\label{cpm}\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath48 represents @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath51 the properties of @xmath52 under the interchanges @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be easily derived from ( [ cdecomp ] )  @xcite : @xmath55 the @xmath54 exchange corresponds to the interchange of the two pions , thus in the case in which the final two pions are @xmath49 we get @xmath56 therefore there is only a @xmath8-even part for @xmath57 . in the following we use @xmath52 to represent the @xmath8-even / odd part of @xmath58 respectively .",
    "isospin invariance implies  @xcite @xmath59 thus according to ( [ gammatensor ] ) , only @xmath60 contributes to the process @xmath61 .",
    "here we only consider the contributions coming from the @xmath62 and @xmath63 quark .",
    "another consequence of isospin invariance is @xmath64    eq .  ( [ gammatensor ] ) shows that the process @xmath65 can be also applied to probe @xmath66 , just like the two photon process @xmath67 , which has been proposed  @xcite to access @xmath66 .",
    "interest on the process @xmath65 relies also on the fact that this process is related to its crossed channel , the deeply virtual compton scattering process ( dvcs ) @xmath68 ( shown in fig .  [ pionpair]b ) , and is referred to as timelike dvcs . in the factorization of the dvcs process , the nonperturbative objects are the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite , which are important for understanding the parton angular momenta inside the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the simplest dvcs process is @xmath68 .",
    "however it is difficult to use the pion as the target , which makes the pion gpds difficult to be experimentally accessed .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that there is a crossing relation that connects gpds and gdas . therefore to measure the process @xmath69 , the crossed channel of the dvcs process ,",
    "can also give experimental indication about the gpds of the pion .",
    "in the kinematical region @xmath70 , the suitable facilities to investigate this process are @xmath71-factories .",
    "finally , we remark that there is a suggestion  @xcite of using the transition distribution amplitude ( tda )  @xcite formalism to describe the process @xmath72 .",
    "in this section we study the phenomenology associated with the process @xmath74 where the intermediate vector boson @xmath75 can be a photon or a @xmath3 boson , based on the analysis given in section [ gammagamma ] and in ref .",
    "we will consider the helicity of the electron in the analysis .",
    "it is useful to define two lorentz invariant variables : @xmath76 the differential cross - section for the process @xmath77 is expressed as @xmath78 in which ( @xmath79 ) is the momentum of pion 1 in the c.m .",

    "the amplitude of @xmath86 can be calculated from @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the polarization vectors of the intermediate virtual boson ( photon or @xmath3 ) and the real photon , respectively . in our reference frame",
    "these vectors have the form : @xmath90    using the notation of ref .",

    "in the previous subsection we have given the expression for the cross - section of the general process @xmath109 , in terms of 2-pion gdas .",
    "there are interesting phenomenological implications coming from eq .",
    "( [ csgandz ] ) . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , measuring the charged pion pair production in the kinematical regime @xmath41 , where the main contribution comes from @xmath3 boson , can provide an opportunity to access the @xmath8-odd part of 2-pion gdas @xmath110 . in this work , however , we consider a different kinematical region @xmath111 .",
    "consequently a different phenomenology emerges : the production through @xmath7 is dominant over the @xmath9 interference and @xmath3 boson terms , which is a result coming from the factors given in eqs .",
    "( [ gg ] ) , ( [ gz ] ) and ( [ zz ] ) .    to avoid the competing contribution from the bremsstrahlung process , in this subsection we limit ourselves to the case of neutral pion pair production .",
    "therefore the terms containing @xmath112 in the hadronic tensor ( [ ltensor ] ) do not contribute to the cross - section , and the calculation is simplified .",
    "based on ( [ csgandz ] ) , we calculate the @xmath83 , @xmath9 interference and @xmath3 contributions to the unpolarized differential cross - section of the process @xmath113 as functions of @xmath1 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ csection ] by a solid line , dashed line and dotted line , respectively . for @xmath114 , which is needed in the calculation , we adopt the simple model given in @xcite .",
    "the curves show that the contribution from the production through @xmath7 is about several orders of magnitude larger than those through @xmath9 interference and @xmath3 boson , in the regime @xmath115",
    ". therefore it would be suitable to investigate @xmath116 through the process @xmath117 , in the regime where @xmath1 is several gev , where the cross - section is relatively large .",
    "the @xmath9 interference term is also interesting because it contains the weak mixing angle @xmath118 . to isolate this term one needs to go beyond the helicity - independent cross - section , that is , to consider the helicity dependent cross - section of the process .",
    "the helicity dependent differential cross - section is dominated by the @xmath9 interference term : @xmath119 since the @xmath3 boson term can be ignored compared to that of the @xmath9 interference term .    as discussed previously , the unpolarized differential cross - section is dominated by the virtual photon production , which reads : @xmath120 the @xmath34-dependence of this cross - ection is shown in fig .",
    "[ neutralw ] , for @xmath121 gev and @xmath122 .",
    "the ratio of the helicity dependent and helicity - independent cross - section , that is , the helicity asymmetry of the process is ( @xmath123 ) @xmath124 which depends on @xmath108 and @xmath118 .",
    "therefore the measurement on this helicity asymmetry provides an alternative approach to extract the value of weak mixing angle @xmath118 . in fig .",
    "[ rs ] we show the @xmath1 dependent ratio @xmath125 which is given in ( [ ratio ] ) . for @xmath126 , which is the typical c.m .",
    "energy of cleo or @xmath71-factories , such as babar and belle , this ratio is about 0.8% , which is a sizeable value .      in the case of charged pion pair production , besides the process @xmath127 , the bremsstrahlung process @xmath128 also needs to be considered .",
    "the cross - section of the former process is the same as that of neutral pion production , since only @xmath114 contributes .",
    "the differential cross - section of the bremsstrahlung process has the form @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the timelike pion form factor .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the interference @xcite between @xmath131 and the bremsstrahlung process , because it can be applied to study the subprocess @xmath132 at the amplitude level , similar to the case @xmath133 that has been discussed in refs .",

    "conversely , these measurements could also be used in order to obtain information about the pion timelike form factor @xmath130 .    in fig .",
    "[ bremint ] we give the curves of the differential cross - sections , coming from the bremsstrahlung process and its interference with the process @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath130 we use the parametrization @xmath140 given in ref .",
    "we show the cross - sections for @xmath141 ( solid line ) and 10 gev ( dashed line ) in fig .",

    "we also show the contribution from the helicity dependent interference term ( dotted line ) for @xmath143 gev .",
    "[ bremint ] shows that the contribution coming from the bremsstrahlung process is @xmath144 orders of magnitude larger than that from the interference term .",
    "according to the shape of @xmath145 , the @xmath34-dependent curves of both the bremsstrahlung and interference contributions have peaks in the region @xmath146 .",
    "in the case of @xmath147-dependence the curves of bremsstrahlung and ( unpolarized ) interference contributions increase with @xmath147 from @xmath148 to @xmath149 , and then decrease .",
    "the @xmath150-dependent curve of the bremsstrahlung contribution has a large value at @xmath151 and a small value at @xmath152 , while that of the ( unpolarized ) interference contribution has a large ( absolute ) value at @xmath152 and a small ( absolute ) value at @xmath151 .",
    "the @xmath153-dependence of the interference contribution shows that the curves have maximum magnitude in the region @xmath154 or 1 ( due to the factor @xmath155 in the denominators of some terms in ( [ intf ] ) ) , which is therefore the suitable region in order to study the interference term .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the case of the bremsstrahlung process .",
