    "magnesium diboride , like other diborides meb@xmath0 ( me = al , zr , ta , nb , ti , v etc . ) , crystalizes in a hexagonal structure , where honeycomb layers of boron are separated by magnesium ions located above and below the centers of boron hexagons .",
    "the hallmark of mgb@xmath0 is that it becomes superconducting ( sc ) at high critical temperature t@xmath3 ( @xmath5 40k ) @xcite , which is a record breaking value among the _ s - p _ metals and alloys .",
    "the outstanding property of mgb@xmath0 is that this material represents a rare example of multi - band ( 2-d @xmath1-band and 3-d @xmath2-band ) electronic structure , which are weakly connected with each other .",
    "these bands lead to very uncommon properties .",
    "for example , t@xmath3 almost does not depend on elastic scattering , unlike for other two - band superconductors @xcite .",
    "the maximal upper critical magnetic field there can achieve a much higher value , than that for a one - band dirty superconductor @xcite .",
    "the properties of mgb@xmath0 have been comprehensively calculated by the modern theoretical methods , which lead to principal understanding of their behavior in various experiments .",
    "electron band structure of mgb@xmath0 was calculated in very detail using different _ ab initio _",
    "methods @xcite .",
    "topmost is that two filled incompletely @xmath1 bands have weak @xmath6 dispersion forming two nearly cylindrical sheets of the fermi surface around @xmath7a @xmath8 . besides they retain their covalent structure representing unique case of conducting covalent bands which contribute to the strong electron - phonon coupling",
    "thus , the hole branch along @xmath7a experiences huge interaction with phonon @xmath4 mode for carriers moving along @xmath9 plane , although its manifestation is screened effectively by the much faster hole mobility in @xmath10-bands @xcite , which form two 3-d tubular network .",
    "appropriate electron transport is very anisotropic ( @xmath11 @xcite ) with a plasma frequency ( and fermi velocity ) for @xmath1 band along @xmath12 axis being an order of magnitude smaller than that in @xmath9 direction @xcite .",
    "inelastic @xmath13-ray scattering measurements @xcite demonstrated a weakly dispersion branch between 60 and 70 mev in @xmath7a direction with @xmath4 symmetry in @xmath7 point .",
    "the linewidth of this mode is about 20@xmath1428 mev along @xmath15a direction , while along @xmath7 m direction it is below the experimental resolution .",
    "this points to the very strong electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) for this particular lattice vibration mode .",
    "the sc energy gap distribution on the fermi surface of mgb@xmath0 @xcite shows maximum gap value along @xmath7a direction which is due to very strong epi . just in this direction",
    "2d @xmath16 band ( cylinders along @xmath7a direction ) is located .",
    "the 3d @xmath10 band has much smaller epi , and , correspondingly , the nearly 3 times smaller energy gap . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is shown that average @xmath17 value on @xmath18 band amounts up to @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 can be decomposed between different phonon modes , and it appears that only e@xmath21 phonon mode along @xmath7a direction plays a major role with a partial @xmath22 value of about @xmath23 @xcite , though concentrating in a very restricted phase space .",
    "driving mechanism for high @xmath24 in mgb@xmath0 is connected with the strong interaction between charge carriers and @xmath4 phonon modes , corresponding to antiparallel vibration of atoms in the boron planes .",
    "the electron band structure of mgb@xmath0 along @xmath7a direction is such that the fermi energy of hole carriers is only 0.5@xmath25ev , which shrinks even more while borons deviate from the equilibrium positions .",
    "together with the 2d structure of the corresponding sheet of the fermi surface , this leads to constant density of states at the fermi energy and , correspondingly , to very strong epi .",
    "@xcite point out that the small fermi velocity for charge carriers along @xmath7a direction leads to large nonadiabatic correction to @xmath24 ( about twice as much compared with adiabatic migdal - eliashberg treatment ) .",
    "although this interaction is a driving force to high @xmath24 in this compound , it does not lead to crystal structure instability , since it occupies only a small volume in the phase space .    according to theoretical models @xmath10 and @xmath26 bands in mgb@xmath0 are weakly connected .",
    "however , the energy gap of @xmath10 band goes to zero at the same @xmath24 as in the bulk , and correspondingly the @xmath27 , which is much less than the weak coupling bcs theory predicts .",
    "one can think of @xmath10 band as having intrinsically much lower @xmath28k than the bulk @xcite and at higher temperatures its superconductivity is induced by proximity effect in the * k*-space from @xmath18 band @xcite .",
    "this proximity effect is very peculiar .",
    "from one side , this proximity is induced by the interband scattering between @xmath10 and @xmath18 sheets of the fermi surface . on the other , the charge carriers connected with @xmath10 band are mainly located along the magnesium planes , which can be considered as a proximity effect in the coordinate space for alternating layers of @xmath29 structure , although at microscopically scale .",
    "thus , mgb@xmath0 is a good example to study crossover between two - band superconductivity and simple proximity effect structure .",
    "in this work the results for two kind of samples are surveyed .",
    "the first is thin c - axis oriented films with the thickness of about several hundreds of nanometer @xcite .",
    "the residual resistance is about several tens of @xmath30 cm with residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) @xmath31 pointing out that films have a disorder between crystallites .",
    "it does not exclude that on some spots the films contain clean enough small single crystals on which we occasionally may fabricate a point contact ( pc ) .",
    "normally , the contacts were prepared by touching the film surface by noble metal counter electrode ( cu , au , ag ) in the direction perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "thus , nominally the preferential current direction in pc is along _ c _ axis .",
    "nevertheless , since the surface of the films contains terraces with small crystallites , pc to _ ab _ plane of these crystallites is also possible .",
    "the second type of samples are single crystals @xcite .",
    "crystals are plate - like ( flakes ) and have sub - millimeter size .",
    "they were glued by silver epoxy to the sample holder by one of their side faces .",
    "the opposite face of flakes was used as a `` needle '' to gently touch the noble metal counter electrode in liquid helium . in this way we tried to make preferentially a contact along _ ab _ plane . in average , in the bulk , the single crystals are cleaner than the films , but one should be cautious , since the properties of the crystal surface differ from the properties of the bulk , and fabrication of pc may introduce uncontrolled further defects in the contact area .",
    "thus , _ a priori _ one can not define the structure and composition of the obtained contacts .",
    "nevertheless , much of that issue can be said by measuring various characteristics of a contact . among those the most important is the andreev - reflection - non - linearities of the @xmath32 curves in the sc energy - gap range . the magnetic field and temperature dependencies of the sc non - linearities supply us with additional information . and finally , much can be extracted from the @xmath32 nonlinearities in the normal state ( so called , pc spectra ) .",
    "the more information about the electrical conductivity at different conditions of the particular contact we can collect , the more detailed and defined picture of it emerges .",
    "it is not an easy task , since a contact has a limited life time , due to electrical and mechanical shocks .",
    "let us give a rough estimation of the distance scales involved in the problem .",
    "the crystallite size of films is of the order of 100 nm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the contact size @xmath33 in ballistic regime equals @xmath34 ( the sharvin formula ) . taking @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37@xmath38 @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath39 nm both along @xmath9 and @xmath12 directions for typical resistance of 10 @xmath40 .",
    "if we suppose that a grain is dirty ( with very short mean free path ) , then we apply the maxwell formula @xmath41 with the results for @xmath33 about 0.7 nm and 2.6 nm for @xmath9 and @xmath12 directions , respectively , taking @xmath42 for corresponding directions from the same reference @xcite .",
    "thus , the contact size can be of the order or smaller than the electronic mean free path ( @xmath43 nm and @xmath44 nm , according to @xcite ) , which means that we are working in the spectroscopic regime , probing only a single grain .",
    "rowell @xcite , analyzing a big amount of experimental data for resistivity and its temperature dependence , came to the conclusion that for highly resistive samples only a small part of the effective cross section should be taken into account .",
    "the reason is that the grains in mgb@xmath0 are disconnected by oxide of magnesium and boron to great extent .",
    "for pcs previous analysis leads us to the conclusion that the contact resistance is frequently measured only for a single grain , either for several grains , with their intergrain boundaries facing the contact interface .",
    "this is due to the current spreading with the scale of the order of the contact size @xmath33 near the constriction .",
    "the non - linearities of the @xmath32 characteristic of a metallic contact , when one of the electrodes is in the sc state , can be written as @xcite    @xmath45    here @xmath46 is the contact resistance at zero bias in the normal state .",
    "@xmath47 is the backscattering inelastic current which depends on the electron mean free path ( mfp ) @xmath48 . for the ballistic contact",
    "this term amounts to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the inelastic electron mfp , and @xmath33 is the characteristic contact diameter . if the electron flow through the contact is diffusive ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 being an elastic mfp ) but still spectroscopic , since @xmath53 , then the expression ( [ inelastic ] ) should be multiplied by @xmath54 .",
    "this decreases the characteristic size , where the inelastic scattering being essential , from @xmath33 to @xmath52 ( @xmath55 ) , and for short @xmath52 makes the inelastic current very small .",
    "we notice that the inelastic backscattering current @xmath47 in the sc state is approximately equal to the same term in the normal state .",
    "its second derivative turns out to be directly proportional to the epi function @xmath56 @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 describes the strength of the electron interaction with one or another phonon branch , @xmath59 stands for the phonon density of states . in pc spectra",
    "the epi spectral function @xmath56 is modified by the transport factor , which increases strongly the backscattering processes contribution .    in the sc state the excess current @xmath60([i - v ] ) , which is due to the andreev reflection of electron quasiparticles from the @xmath61 boundary in a @xmath62 contact ( @xmath12 stands for  constriction  ) , can be written as    @xmath63    where @xmath64 for @xmath65 ( @xmath66 being the sc energy gap ) .",
    "nonlinear term in the excess current ( [ excess ] ) in its turn can be decomposed in two parts , which depend in a different way on the elastic scattering of electron quasiparticles :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is of the order of @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "notice , that the latter behaves very similar to the inelastic backscattering current @xmath47 , namely , it disappears if @xmath71 , while the first term in the right hand side of expression ( [ excess1 ] ) does not depend in the first approximation on @xmath52 .",
    "this enables to distinguish elastic term from inelastic .",
    "finally , all excess current terms disappear when destroying the superconductivity , while @xmath72 remains very similar in both sc and normal states .    from the expressions ( [ i - v ] ) , ( [ inelastic ] ) , ( [ excess ] ) and",
    "( [ excess1 ] ) , it becomes clear that only on the relatively _ clean _ spots , one can observe the inelastic backscattering current @xmath47 provided the excess current term @xmath73 is negligible .",
    "the latter can be cancelled by suppression of superconductivity either with magnetic field or temperature . on the contrary , in the sc state , for _ dirty _ contacts , all the inelastic terms are very small , and the main non - linearity is provided by the @xmath74-dependence of the excess current .",
    "brinkman _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that even along _",
    "ab_-plane the contribution of @xmath18 band for mgb@xmath0 is less than that of @xmath10 band , to say nothing of the direction along _ c _ axis , where it is negligible small .",
    "the calculation predicts that if the  _ tunneling cone _  is about several degrees from precise _ ab _ plane , then two sc gaps should be visible in tunneling characteristics .",
    "in other directions only a single gap , corresponding to @xmath10 band , is visible .",
    "we will see below that this prediction is fulfilled in pc experiment , as well .",
    "even worse the things are when one tries to measure the anisotropic eliashberg function by means of the sc tunneling .",
    "the single - band numerical inversion program gives non - certain results , as was shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "point - contact spectroscopy in the normal state can help in this deadlock situation .",
    "it is known that the inelastic backscattering current is based on the same mechanism as an ordinary homogeneous resistance , provided the maximum energy of charge carriers is controlled by applied voltage .",
    "the electrical conductivity of mgb@xmath0 can be considered as parallel connections of two channels , corresponding to @xmath10 and @xmath26 bands @xcite .",
    "the conductivity of @xmath10 band can be blocked by mg - atoms disorder .",
    "this situation is already obtained in experiment , when the temperature coefficient of resistivity increases simultaneously with increase of residual resistivity , which leads to the violation of the matthiessen s rule ( see fig.3 in @xcite ) . in this case",
    "we obtain the direct access to @xmath16-band conductivity , and the measurements of pc spectra of epi for @xmath1 band are explicitly possible in the normal state . below we will see that this unique situation happens in single crystals along _ ab _ plane .",
    "typical shapes of @xmath75 with andreev reflection features are shown in fig.[mgb2del ] .",
    "[ mgb2del ]    @xmath75 curves exhibit two sets of energy gap minima distributed as shown in fig .",
    "[ mgb2hist ] ( upper panel ) , at 2.4@xmath76 0.1 and 7.1@xmath760.4 mev .",
    "these curves are nicely fitted by btk @xcite theory ( with a small @xmath77 parameter ) for two conducting channels with an adjusted gap weighting factor @xcite .",
    "the second kind of @xmath75 represents only one gap structure and is better fitted with a single gap provided an increased depairing parameter @xmath7 ( fig.[mgb2hist ] , inset ) . according to the calculation in @xcite strong impurity scattering will cause the gaps to converge to @xmath784.1mev and @xmath24 to 25.4k .",
    "therefore the single gap spectra reflect a strong interband scattering due to impurities , which likely causes a `` semiconducting - like '' behavior of @xmath75 above t@xmath3 .",
    "these two kinds of gap structure constitute about equal parts of a total number of about hundred junctions .",
    "usually the contribution of the large gap in the double - gap spectra is an order of magnitude lower than that of the small one , which is in line with small contribution of @xmath1 band in conductivity along c axis @xcite .",
    "[ mgb2hist ]    in the lower panel of fig.[mgb2hist ] the theoretical prediction of energy gap distribution @xcite is shown .",
    "one can see that the theoretical positions of distribution maxima approximately coincide with the experimental values . only the low - lying maximum is not seen in the experiment .",
    "the same variety of energy gap structure is observed for single crystals as well , but with some peculiarity due to preferential orientation along _ ab _ plane .",
    "the most amazing of them is the observation of a @xmath75 gap structure in @xcite with visually only the larger gap present .",
    "such kind of spectra were not observed in thin films .",
    "it means that the conductivity is governed only by @xmath18 band .",
    "this may be caused that @xmath10 band is blocked completely by mg disorder or by oxidation of mg atoms on _ ab_-side surface of the crystal .",
    "at the same time , in single crystal there is much less scattering in the boron planes , due to the robustness of b - b bonds .",
    "we will see below that just this case enables us to observe directly the most important @xmath4 phonon mode in the electron - phonon interaction within @xmath1 band",

    "unexpectedly , the stronger we suppress the superconductivity by magnetic field or temperature in mgb@xmath0 , the less traces of phonon structure remain in the @xmath82 derivative @xcite .",
    "this is in odd with the classical pcs , since the _",

    "is seen for pc with a large gap that is along @xmath97 direction in accordance with the theory .",
    "the relatively small intensity of this mode in the pc spectra is likely due to their small wave vector and restricted phase volume . *",
    "related diborides ( zrb@xmath0 , nbb@xmath0 , and tab@xmath0 ) have pc spectra proportional to the electron - phonon - interaction spectral function , like in common metals and small epi constant corresponding to their non - sc state at helium temperature .",
