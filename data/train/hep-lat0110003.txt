    "matrix elements involving moving @xmath0 and @xmath3 mesons are important for studies of @xmath4 and @xmath5 decay .",
    "it is necessary to understand the systematic errors in lattice qcd that come from the presence of non - zero momenta and the optimal way in which to handle such mesons on the lattice .",
    "an easy place to study these effects is in the determination of the @xmath0 meson decay constant , @xmath1  @xcite .    in the absence of discretisation errors",
    "it should be true that @xmath6 we use both @xmath7 and @xmath8 with all current corrections and renormalisation through @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "results shown are for an ensemble of 278 @xmath10 lattices at @xmath11 = 5.7 .",
    "clover light quarks are used with @xmath12 and nrqcd heavy quarks are used with masses in lattice units of 2 and 8 ( @xmath13 = 4.0 ) .",
    "all momenta are considered up to @xmath14 of 16 in units of @xmath15 , i.e. roughly 4 @xmath16 at this lattice spacing .",
    "we generated heavy and light quark propagators with 3 different smearings : a delta function , a narrow gaussian ( width 1 ) and a broad gaussian ( width 3 ) .",
    "we combined these smearings together to make 6 different smearings for the heavy - light meson and analysed the resulting smeared - smeared meson correlators using the constrained curve fitting methods described in @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 , which plots the amplitude of the ground state @xmath0 meson as a function of squared momentum for some of these smearings .",
    "it is clear that the optimal smearing for a moving heavy - light meson is one in which the smearing on the heavy quark is a narrow one and the smearing on the light quark is a broad one .",
    "this is not surprising if one considers that the heavy quark is carrying almost all of the meson momentum .",
    "the overlap as a function of momentum is maximized if the heavy quark has a delta function smearing , but in that case the statistical noise is large because of the well - known problem that an unsmeared heavy quark has a poor signal / noise ratio  @xcite . at zero momentum",
    "this has led to the received wisdom that the heavy quark should have a broad smearing - figure 1 shows that this is not correct at non - zero momentum .",
    "figure 2 amplifies this point by showing the rapid plateau and consequent small error on the kinetic energy possible with a good finite - momentum smearing , in contrast to that obtained with a smearing that might have been considered a good one at zero momentum .",
    "we used smearing ` 5 ' from the above analysis and the constrained curve fitting methods to determine @xmath1 for moving @xmath0 mesons and the temporal axial current .",
    "matrix elements for @xmath7 are obtained from a simultaneous fit to _ all _ @xmath17 ( i=0,1,2 ) and @xmath18 ( i=0,1,2,3,4 ) current correlators at a given momentum .",
    "the construction of the continuum @xmath7 from @xmath19 is described in @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows results for the ratio : @xmath20 for @xmath21=8 using @xmath22 in the renormalisation .",
    "the expected curve @xmath23 is also shown .",
    "no disagreement is seen until the highest momentum . at @xmath21 = 2",
    ", larger discrepancies appear  @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements for the spatial axial current behave rather differently to those for the temporal axial current since they must vanish when there is no component of @xmath24 along the direction of the current .",
    "even the leading order current , @xmath25 = @xmath26 then has a matrix element @xmath27@xmath28 with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "this is of the same order as the ` @xmath30 ' suppressed current contributions from @xmath31 = @xmath32 and @xmath33 = @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath31 contributes at tree level and @xmath33 at one - loop to the final result for @xmath8 . to understand the size of different current contributions it is important to use a power - counting in both the external velocity and in @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows results for the ratio : @xmath36 as a function of @xmath37 for a range of values of @xmath38 , for @xmath21=8 .",
    "the line shown is @xmath39 ( variation with @xmath38 of this line is not significant ) .",
    "good agreement with the line is found for @xmath40 = 1,2 ( @xmath41 ) at all @xmath38 but @xmath40 = 3,4 show signs of deviation , presumably from missing current corrections that are higher order in the external velocity .",
    "figure 4 shows agreement between @xmath1 from @xmath7 and @xmath8 which resolves a long - standing problem .",
    "@xcite found a disagreement of @xmath27(10% ) when comparing the tree - level matrix elements for clover fermions .",
    "this ignores the contribution of @xmath33 and does not allow for the clover equivalent of the different renormalisation of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "both these effects are included here .",
    "we have demonstrated the usefulness of optimal ( i.e. narrow ) smearing for heavy quarks in moving heavy - light mesons , and of constrained curve fitting in extracting results out to much higher momenta than have previously been attempted .",
    "good agreement is found for @xmath1 at zero and non - zero momentum . for the temporal axial current at large @xmath21 this holds out to the highest momenta studied . to understand the behaviour of the currents at non - zero momentum it is important to use a power - counting appropriate to moving heavy - light mesons .    * acknowledgements * sc , gc",
