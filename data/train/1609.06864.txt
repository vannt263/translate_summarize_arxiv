    "medical diagnosis is the process of identifying the disease a patient is affected by , based on the assessment of specific risk factors , signs , symptoms and results of exams .",
    "probabilistic networks @xcite are increasingly used to support medical diagnosis , as they provide an efficient representation of complex stochastic systems by exploiting causal knowledge , and because several efficient algorithms to perform probabilistic reasoning ( evidence propagation ) are available @xcite .",
    "probabilistic networks are composed of a _ qualitative part _ , that is a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) defining a factorization of the joint probability distribution of domain variables , and of a _ quantitative part _",
    ", where each factor defines a conditional probability distribution . in medical problems ,",
    "the dag is often specified in terms of causal relationships among variables according to pathophysiological knowledge contained in the specialised literature .",
    "however , the information required to estimate the quantitative part is typically scattered in many different sources and varies greatly in quality @xcite .",
    "medical literature represents the most reliable source of quantitative information , but it may not cover all aspects of interest . when this is the case , medical experts are a useful alternative resource , even though their quantitative assessments may not be reliable without special training @xcite .",
    "clinical data from medical records are another valuable source of knowledge to build a probabilistic network , but they are typically limited to few variables or contain many missing values . in existing medical applications of probabilistic networks , the quantitative part is typically estimated exploiting either expert knowledge @xcite , or a database of patient cases @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe our experience in the development of a probabilistic network for the diagnosis of acute cardiopulmonary diseases , where two sources of information , beliefs from medical experts and clinical data , were exploited to estimate the quantitative part .",
    "the probabilistic network was conceived as an extension of baypad ( _ bayesian pulmonary embolism assisted diagnosis _ ) , a probabilistic network for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism @xcite .",
    "the work involved a panel of medical experts from various specialties and consisted of three stages . in the first stage ,",
    "the qualitative part was specified by medical experts following the constraint dag described in @xcite . in the second stage",
    ", we applied a special formal representation to the quantitative part , characterized by a low number of parameters and a parameterization intelligible for physicians , and the joint prior distribution of parameters was elicited from medical experts . in the third stage , we updated the joint prior distribution of parameters in the bayesian paradigm by conditioning on a dataset of hospital patient records using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulation .",
    "the three stages were iterated until the probabilistic network provided reasonable inference on six fictitious patient cases .",
    "the three stages were iterated until the probabilistic network provided satisfactory concordance index values for several acute diseases and reasonable inference on several fictitious patient cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dag_eli ] , we provide details on the specification of the qualitative part . in section [ sec : param_eli ] , we explain the formal representation for the quantitative part and the method to elicit the joint prior distribution of parameters . in section [ sec : mcmc ] , we present data and provide details on bayesian estimation of the quantitative part . in section [ sec : illus ] , we illustrate the elicitation task for two variables in the probabilistic network , and compare the resulting prior distribution with the posterior distribution obtained from mcmc simulation . in section [ sec : refin ] , we detail the refinement process . section [ sec : discuss ] includes the discussion of our contribution .",
    "the qualitative part of a probabilistic network consists of a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) representing a factorization of the joint probability distribution of variables .",
    "each node of the dag represents a variable , that may receive any number of directed edges , indicating on which variables ( parent variables ) its probability distribution is conditioned .",
    "the qualitative part of our probabilistic network was specified complying the constraint dag ( c - dag , figure [ fig : consdag ] ) described in @xcite , where c - nodes are sets of variables and c - edges among c - nodes specify allowed directions of edges in the qualitative part of the probabilistic network .",
    "medical experts populated c - nodes of the c - dag with relevant medical variables , as documented in the specialised literature .",
    "edges that join nodes belonging to different c - nodes always agree with c - edges , while eventual edges joining nodes belonging to the same c - node were specified by medical experts , without obeying any constraint besides the absence of directed cycles in the resulting dag . the automated interview proposed by @xcite",
    "was not adopted because it was conceived to derive the dag corresponding to a single patient presentation .    due to the large number of variables ,",
    "the resulting qualitative part is not displayed , but the typology and the set of parent variables ( parent set ) of each one is shown in appendix 2 .",
    "table [ tab : taxon ] provides the classification of variables included in the probabilistic network with respect to their statistical and medical ( as defined by the maximal constraint dag ) typology .",

    "absence of cough would represent an atypical finding , although the symptom may have not been reported because deemed obvious in patients affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .",
    "a cardiogenic pulmonary edema may also have occurred at this age , particularly in the light of a past episode of ischemic heart disease .",
    "furthermore , the reported onset of supraventricular arrithmya may have easily triggered congestive heart failure .",
    "a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation is likely to coexist with both diagnostic hypotheses .    in case 2 ,",
    "pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis , due to the presence of a risk factor ( oestrogen assumption ) combined with respiratory symptoms .",
    "nonetheless , the smoking habit and middle age of the patient also make an acute coronary event and a subsequent myocardial infarction possible .    in case 3",
    ", the presentation immediately reminds of cases with acute myocardial infarction , as attested by the chest symptoms and the laboratory findings .",
    "however , the model does not forget to remind of the existence of rarer conditions , like pulmonary embolism .    in case 4 , after that electrocardiographic findings reveal a right axis deviation , the diagnosis is correctly oriented towards pulmonary embolism .    in case 5 ,",
    "the shortness of breath , together with the low oxygen saturation and the increment of the interstitial pulmonary net , makes pulmonary edema a likely hypothesis , possibly explained as the effect of an acute heart failure .",
    "nonetheless , other diagnostic hypotheses can not be dismissed , particularly pneumonia , which could justify the state of confusion , although similar consequences on patient s awareness may be referred to the low oxygen saturation .    in case 6 ,",
    "acute heart failure is by far the most likely explanation of worsening dyspnea due to chronic heart disease . as a secondary complicating disorder , pulmonary edema",
    "is suggested by chest x - rays and the pulmonary crepitations on auscultation .",
    "underlying causes may encompass acute myocardial infarction , despite the absence of chest pain , particularly because the patient is diabetic and troponin levels are higher than normal .",
    "however , elevated troponin levels may be explained by other hypotheses , like a sustained tachycardia , although heart rate was not extremely higher than normal at the time of visit .",
