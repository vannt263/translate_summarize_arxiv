    "in many applications in quantum information processing , such as quantum teleportation @xcite and entanglement based quantum key distribution @xcite , it is essential that two separated parties , alice and bob , share the maximally entangled particles in advance .",

    "it is thus important that alice and bob share maximally entangled pairs even through such channels . for that purpose , entanglement concentration @xcite and purification ( or distillation ) @xcite have been originally proposed . in these schemes , previously shared less entangled pairs can be transformed into a smaller number of maximally entangled pairs by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . until today",
    ", many schemes to obtain maximally entangled particles by locc have been proposed @xcite .",
    "in this paper we propose an experimentally feasible concentration / purification scheme , in which a maximally entangled photon pair is obtained from two photon pairs in identical partially entangled states .",

    "alice or bob performs a collective measurement for the joint state of @xmath0 pairs of particles ( called as the schmidt projection method ) , then they convert the projected state into a smaller number of maximally entangled pairs . for polarization entangled photons ,",
    "however , the schmidt projection method is difficult to perform because collective and non - destructive measurements for photons are not feasible today . in our scheme , alice and bob use only linear optical elements and photon detectors , in which destructive detection of two photons realizes the required projection and the conversion at the same time . in a similar scheme @xcite , which uses entanglement swapping for two pairs of entangled photons",
    ", it is assumed that initially alice has both photons of one pair and alice and bob share photons of the other pair . in our scheme , in contrast , we assume that the two pairs are distributed in the same way , namely , alice obtains one member of each photon pair , and bob obtains the other member of each photon pair , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "this feature makes the proposed scheme applicable to quantum channels with unknown fluctuations , namely the proposed scheme also works for purifying a class of mixed states . in the following , therefore",
