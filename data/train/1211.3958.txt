    "random polynomials are ubiquitous in several areas of mathematics and have found several applications in diverse fields such as random matrix theory , representation theory and chaotic systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the geometric structure of random polynomials is of significant interest as well .",
    "constructing a random polynomial from its roots is a natural construction which can be expected to occur in a wide range of settings .",
    "for instance , consideration of the asymptotic behavior of the maximum magnitude allowed the authors to obtain a lower bound on the minimum singular value for random vandermonde matrices ( see @xcite for more details ) .    in this work",
    "we continue the investigation of such polynomials , where we allow for non  constant multiplicity of the roots .",
    "we show that providing this sequence satisfies a simple sufficient condition , the limit distribution of the maximum magnitude on the unit circle is determined by a certain gaussian process obtained from the brownian bridge .",
    "surprisingly this limit , up to renormalization , does not depend on the sequence itself .",
    "our construction for these random polynomials is as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be an infinite sequence of positive integers and let @xmath1 be sequence of i.i.d .",
    "uniform distributed unit magnitude complex numbers .",
    "the above pair of sequences , then determine a sequence of random polynomials @xmath2 with roots on the unit circle and their corresponding exponents .",
    "our main result relies on a construction based on the brownian bridge and enables us to conclude that @xmath6 converges weakly to a positive random variable @xmath5 where @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be as before and let @xmath9 be defined as @xmath10 for @xmath11 $ ] . also let @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "as explained in the introduction we are interested in the behaviour of the maximum magnitude squared of @xmath14 as @xmath15 increases .",
    "since @xmath16 is a continuous function on the unit circle , it follows that there exists @xmath17 that attains its maximum .",
    "let @xmath18 be this value . for later use ,",
    "let @xmath19 be the set of @xmath20 times the dyadic rationals on the interval @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath22 the case @xmath23 appears in connection with the asymptotic behaviour of the minimum eigenvalue of random vandermonde matrices ( see @xcite for more details ) . in this special case ,",
    "weak convergence to the normal distribution holds @xmath24 for every fixed @xmath25 where @xmath26 this is in fact a consequence of the central limit theorem since @xmath27 is square summable and @xmath28 .    in what follows",
    "we derive a simple sufficient condition for the asymptotic normality of the random variable @xmath29 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a random variable and @xmath32 is a borel set . let @xmath33 be a sequence of independent zero mean and variance @xmath34 random variables .",

    "since @xmath47 and @xmath48 are positive it follows that , @xmath49 and applying markov s inequality with @xmath46 we obtain @xmath50 we thus obtain the following bound for the upper lindberg condition , @xmath51 the sum on the rhs goes to 0 as this is the condition we assumed holds and because @xmath52 and @xmath48 are arbitrary and fixed .",
    "we now turn to the lower lindberg condition , where @xmath53 .",

    "using the following two basic inequalities , @xmath57 for @xmath58 and , @xmath59 for @xmath60 we obtain that , @xmath61 where @xmath62 . since @xmath63 , we make the substitution @xmath64 and determine the above expectation to be @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 . rewriting this expression",
    "we obtain @xmath68 summing over @xmath69 and dividing by @xmath70 we obtain that @xmath71 now applying the classical lindberg s theorem @xcite the proof is complete .    the condition is easily verified to hold when @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , it is easy to show that this condition fails if @xmath74 .",
    "the result in section [ sec_prelim ] was for the marginal distribution of @xmath75 for a fixed value @xmath25 .",
    "however , we would like to consider the weak limit for the sequence @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "it is well known that weak convergence in the sequence space @xmath78 is entailed by weak convergence of the finite dimensional distributions .",
    "for this reason , it is important to understand the joint distribution of @xmath79 such variables .",
    "we first focus on the case @xmath80 .",

    "we assume that @xmath89 and @xmath90 since otherwise there is nothing to show .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath91 however , the triangle inequality implies that if @xmath92 then either , @xmath93 or the corresponding inequality for @xmath94 holds ( or both ) .",
    "however , we have already demonstrated that @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",
    "as far as the terms involving @xmath97 are concerned we only need to show the above in the case that , @xmath98 that is we wish to show , @xmath99 but the above is smaller than @xmath100 using markov s inequality as in ( [ eqn_yright ] ) we see that @xmath101 applying ( [ eqn_cossquare ] ) and using that @xmath102 $ ] we see that @xmath103 it follows that ( [ eqn_finsum ] ) tends to 0 as @xmath104 .",
    "thus by an extension of the arguments given in the proof of theorem [ thm_lindberg ] it can be shown that condition ( [ eqn_suff ] ) is sufficient for the lindberg condition to hold in respect of the random variables @xmath105 .",

    "since the function @xmath123 is continuous on the interval @xmath110 $ ] there exists a value @xmath17 which determines the maximum value of @xmath123 , which we denote by @xmath158 .",
    "since @xmath159 is dense on the unit circle it follows that @xmath160 and its distribution is determined via the infinite sequence @xmath161 .",
    "let the sequence of random variables @xmath162 .",
    "we now derive one more lemma for use later on .",
    "[ lem_dctsmap ] let @xmath163 be a function in @xmath164 $ ] .",

    "the former follows from the fact that they can be uniformly approximated by simple functions , a direct consequence of lemma 1 and the latter also .",
    "convergence follows from the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem .",
    "this holds since the sequence @xmath166 is uniformly bounded , by a constant so the sequence is dominated .",
    "second @xmath163 is continuous a.e . with pointwise convergence holding at points of continuity , as a consequence of convergence in @xmath168",

    "[ thm_weakconvergence ] the sequence @xmath170 converges in distribution to the sequence @xmath171 @xmath172 as @xmath173 .    in order to do",

    "first , we define @xmath177 using a realization of the brownian bridge as follows , @xmath183^{2\\pi - \\epsilon}_{\\epsilon } - \\int_\\epsilon^{2\\pi-\\epsilon } { w^o}_{\\varphi_r}(\\psi )   \\frac{\\sin \\psi}{1 - \\cos \\psi } d \\psi.\\ ] ] the definition of the other sequence is more involved and so we defer it for a moment .",
    "we have shown that the limit integrals exist a.s .",
    "and so we only need to show that the first term converge to 0 .",
    "since @xmath184 when @xmath48 is small and in a neighbourhood of 0 and @xmath20 we may invoke the levy modulus of continuity , wrapped around at @xmath20 to obtain that this term is @xmath185 hence , coordinate convergence of the integrals holds so that @xmath186 and it follows that @xmath187 as @xmath188 , since the sign of the integral is immaterial .",
    "we have thus demonstrated the second condition of ( [ eqn_weakcond ] ) .",
    "next , we proceed by rewriting @xmath189 in terms of the empirical distribution function @xmath190\\to [ 0,1]$ ] determined by @xmath191 by definition of @xmath192 and the lebesgue  stieljes integral we see that @xmath193 where the change of variables , @xmath194 has been made .",
    "for @xmath195 we define @xmath196 as the `` cycled '' empirical distribution function of @xmath197 by    @xmath198    to define the sequence @xmath199 we split the integral into two parts as in @xmath200 and @xmath201 and then use integration by parts on the first part , which yields the expression , @xmath202}_\\epsilon^{2\\pi-\\epsilon } { \\right)}\\\\ \\label{eqn_tnepsdefn }   & - & \\sqrt{s_n }   \\int_\\epsilon^{2\\pi - \\epsilon } { \\left(}f_{n,\\varphi_r}(\\psi ) - \\frac{\\psi}{2\\pi } { \\right)}\\frac{\\sin \\psi}{(1 - \\cos \\psi ) } d\\psi \\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for later use we make the definition , @xmath203 this is not quite equal to the original sum , since @xmath204 so that the @xmath25 terms do not give 0 but rather cancel with @xmath205 to be defined in a moment .",
    "the remainder we express it as a sum , noting that we must include the mean , which is by symmetry , @xmath206 define @xmath207 \\rc$ ] and hence the sum can be written as @xmath208 denote the corresponding sequence as @xmath209 .",
    "taking expectations we thus find that @xmath210 is a sequence of random variables with 0 mean .",
    "we finally write , @xmath211 we now proceed to demonstrate the first condition of ( [ eqn_weakcond ] ) , namely that , @xmath212 .",
    "the random variable @xmath213 is a functional of an empirical distribution and therefore of a process lying in @xmath164 $ ] .",
    "define the random sequence @xmath214 defined for @xmath215 $ ] and @xmath216 with the component term , @xmath217 it is well known that @xmath218 in @xmath168 , which implies that @xmath219 as @xmath173 for all @xmath220 .",
    "the result follows on showing that @xmath214 defines a measurable mapping @xmath221 \\rightarrow { { \\mathbb r}}^\\infty$ ] in @xmath164 $ ] . since @xmath222 we may therefore apply theorem 5.1 , corollary 1 of @xcite which states that if @xmath223 then @xmath224 , ( and hence @xmath225 ) provided that we verify @xmath226 to deal with the measurability question we first observe that the coordinate maps are measurable and since @xmath227 is continuous in @xmath228 $ ] , it follows by lemma [ lem_dctsmap ] that @xmath229 is measurable for each @xmath220 and",
    "hence so is the sequence mapping @xmath214 .",
    "again by lemma [ lem_dctsmap ] the sequence of integrals convergences with respect to @xmath175 .",
    "this leaves only the final term .",
    "however , since the limit @xmath116 is almost surely continuous it follows that @xmath230 for each @xmath220 if @xmath231 in @xmath164 $ ] .",
    "thus the corresponding sequence converges with respect to @xmath175 also and so ( [ eqn_probdiscontinuity ] ) holds .",
    "the proof of the first condition is concluded .",
    "it remains to demonstrate ( [ eqn_probmetric ] ) .",
    "here we use the union bound and chebyshev s inequality .",
    "this is because the various @xmath232 in the sequences are dependent , as they are determined via the same @xmath233 .",
    "nevertheless they are of course themselves the sum of i.i.d",

    "it follows that @xmath240 as @xmath241 , which is the variance of the entire sum by independence and as it has been scaled .",
    "now fix @xmath242 . by definition of @xmath175 and from ( [ eqn_seqdiff ] )",
    "we obtain that , @xmath243 let @xmath244 be such that @xmath245 .",
    "now we apply the union bound to the remaining @xmath246 summands to obtain that @xmath247 hence , @xmath248 and the rhs goes to 0 as @xmath48 to 0 , for each @xmath180 .",
    "hence we obtain ( [ eqn_probmetric ] ) as required .",
    "therefore , we have verified all conditions and theorem [ thm_weakconvergence ] is proved .",
