    "galactic transient black hole candidates ( bhcs ) are the most fascinating objects to study in x - ray domain since these sources exhibit evolutions in their timing and spectral properties during their outbursts .",
    "several attempts @xcite were made for a thorough study on the temporal and spectral evolutions of the transient black hole ( bh ) binaries during their outbursts .",
    "various spectral states were identified during different phases of the outburst . in general , four basic spectral states ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 )",
    "are observed during the outburst of a transient bhc @xcite .",
    "one can find detailed discussions about these spectral states and their transitions in the literature @xcite .",
    "it was also reported by several authors @xcite that the observed spectral states form a hysteresis loop during their outbursts .",
    "also , these different spectral states of the hysteresis - loop are found to be associated with different branches of a q - like plot of x - ray color vs intensity i.e. , the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) @xcite .",
    "the transient low - mass galactic x - ray binary h  1743 - 322 was first discovered @xcite with the ariel - v all - sky monitor and subsequently observed with the heao-1 satellite @xcite in x - rays during the period of aug - sep , 1977 . during the 1977 - 78 outburst ,",
    "the source was observed several times in the hard x - ray band of @xmath4 kev energy range with the heao-1 satellite @xcite .",
    "the observation revealed that the soft x - ray transient ( based on the @xmath5 kev spectral properties ) also emits x - rays in the energy range of @xmath6 kev @xcite .",
    "@xcite categorized the source as a potential black hole candidate ( bhc ) based on the ` color - color ' diagram using the spectral data of the heao-1 satellite .",
    "after almost two decades , in 2003 , the integral satellite discovered signatures of renewed activity in hard x - rays @xcite and later , rxte also verified the presence of such an activity @xcite . during the 2003 outburst ,",
    "the source was continuously and extensively monitored in x - rays @xcite , ir @xcite , and in radio bands @xcite to reveal the multi - wavelength properties of the source .",
    "the multi - wavelength campaign on this source during its 2003 and 2009 outbursts were also carried out by @xcite respectively .    the low - frequency as well as high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) along with a strong spectral variability",
    "are observed in the 2003 and other outbursts of the source in rxte pca data @xcite . these have resemblance with several other typical galactic black hole candidates ( e.g. , gro  j1655 - 40 , xte j1550 - 564 , gx 339 - 4 etc . ) .",
    "another important discovery of large - scale relativistic x - ray and radio jets associated with the 2003 outburst @xcite put the source in the category of ` micro - quasar ' .",
    "this was also reconfirmed by @xcite , from their comparative study on the timing and the spectral properties of this source with xte j1550 - 564 .    recently in 2010 and 2011 , the transient black hole candidate h  1743 - 322 again exhibited outbursts @xcite with similar characteristics of state transitions @xcite as observed in other outburst sources @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a new class of accretion state dependent @xmath7  mhz qpo frequency during the early initial phase of both the outbursts under study .",
    "rxte has observed both these outbursts on a daily basis , which continued for a time period of around two months .",
    "we made a detailed study on the temporal and the spectral properties of h 1743 - 322 during these two outbursts using archival data of pca instrument on board rxte satellite .",
    "altogether @xmath8 observations starting from 2010 august 9 ( mjd = 55417 ) to 2010 september 30 ( mjd = 55469 ) of the 2010 outburst are analyzed in this paper . after remaining in the quiescence state for around seven months , h  1743 - 322 again became active in x -",
    "rays on 2011 april 6 ( mjd = 55657 ) , as reported by @xcite .",
    "rxte started monitoring the source six days later ( on 2011 april 12 , mjd = 55663 ) . here , we also analyze rxte pca archival data of @xmath9 observations spread over the entire outburst , starting from 2011 april 12 to 2011 may 19 ( mjd = 55700 ) .",
    "the preliminary results of this work were already presented in cospar 2012 @xcite .",
    "apart from the 2010 and 2011 outbursts , there are six outbursts of h  1743 - 322 observed by rxte in recent past . detailed results of these outbursts have already been reported in the literature @xcite and the evolution of all outbursts typically follow the ` q - diagram ' in the hardness - intensity plane ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , except the 2008 outburst which does not follow the ` standard ' outburst profile and is termed as the ` failed - outburst ' @xcite .",
    "although the mass of the black hole has not yet been measured dynamically , there are several attempts to measure the mass of the black hole based on the timing and spectral properties of h  1743 - 322 . from the model of high frequency qpos based on the mass - angular momentum ( i.e. , spin of the black hole ) relation ,",
    "@xcite predicted that the mass can fall in the range between @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution of qpo frequency during the outburst phases of the transient bhcs has been well reported for a long time @xcite .",
    "same type of qpo evolutions were observed during both the rising and the declining phases of these two outbursts as of other black hole candidates , such as , 2005 outburst of gro j1655 - 40 @xcite , 1998 outburst of xte j1550 - 564 @xcite and 2010 - 11 outburst of gx 339 - 4 @xcite .",
    "the successful interpretation of these qpo evolutions with the propagating oscillatory shock ( pos ) model @xcite motivated us to fit the qpo evolutions of the recent outbursts of h  1743 - 322 with the same model . from the model fit ,",
    "accretion flow parameters are calculated ( see , table 1 below ) .",
    "this _ paper _ is organized in the following way : in the next section , we discuss about the observation and data analysis procedures using heasarc s heasoft software package . in  3 , we present temporal and spectral results of our observation . in ",
    "3.1 , the evolution of light curves ( 2 - 25 kev count rates ) and hardness ratios of the 2010 and 2011 outbursts of h  1743 - 322 are discussed . in ",
    "3.2 , we compare the evolution of the hardness - intensity diagrams of these two outbursts . in  3.3 , we show the time evolving ( decreasing or increasing ) nature of qpo frequency observed during rising and declining phases in both the outbursts ( 2010 and 2011 ) of h  1743 - 322 and apply the propagating oscillatory shock ( pos ) model to explain the variations of the centroid qpo frequency over time . in  3.4 , we present the spectral analysis results and classify the entire duration of the outbursts into four spectral states : hard , hard - intermediate , soft - intermediate and soft .",
    "finally , in  4 , we present the brief discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "the campaigns carried out with rxte cover the entire 2010 and 2011 outbursts of h  1743 - 322 starting from 2010 august 9 ( mjd = 55417 ) to 2010 september 30 ( mjd = 55469 ) and from 2011 april 12 ( mjd = 55663 ) to 2011 may 19 ( mjd = 55700 ) .",
    "we analyzed archival data of the rxte pca instrument and follow the standard data analysis techniques as done by @xcite .",
    "the heasoft 6.11 version of the software package was used to analyze the pca data .",
    "we extract data from the most stable and well calibrated proportional counter unit 2 ( pcu2 ; all the three layers are co - added ) . for the timing analysis , we use the pca event mode data with a maximum timing resolution of @xmath12 . to generate the power - density spectra ( pds )",
    ", we use the  powspec \" task of xronos package with a normalization factor of ` -2 ' to have the expected ` white ' noise subtracted rms fractional variability on 2 - 15 kev ( 0 - 35 channels of pcu2 ) light curves of @xmath13 sec time bins .",
    "the power obtained has the unit of rms@xmath14/hz .",
    "observed qpos are generally of lorentzian type @xcite .",
    "so , to find centroid frequency of qpos , power density spectra(pds ) are fitted with lorentzian profiles and fit error limits are obtained by using ",

    "spectral data are used .",
    "the heasarc s software package xspec ( version 12.5 ) is used for analyzing and modeling the spectral data . a fixed value of 1% systematic error and the hydrogen column density ( @xmath20 ) of @xmath21 @xcite for absorption model _ wabs _ , are used to fit the spectra .",
    "@xmath22 kev background subtracted pca spectra are fitted with a combination of standard thermal ( diskbb ) and non - thermal ( power - law ) models or with only power - law component , where thermal photon contribution was much less ( mainly in spectra from the hard and hard - intermediate spectral states ) .",
    "to achieve best fit , a single gaussian iron line @xmath23 kev is also used .",
    "the fluxes of different model components of the spectra are calculated using _ cflux _ calculation method .",
    "the accretion flow properties during the outburst phases of the transient bhcs can be understood in a better manner by studying x - ray properties of these sources both in temporal and spectral domains .",
    "it is pointed out by @xcite that depending upon the outburst light curve profiles , there are mainly two types of outbursting bhcs : one is ` fast - rise slow - decay ' ( frsd ) type and the other is ` slow - rise slow - decay ' ( srsd ) type .",
    "the source , h  1743 - 322 belongs to the first category . although the general nature of the transient x - ray binaries is more complex ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "-0.25 cm 0.80 cm      for studying x - ray intensity variations of the 2010 and 2011 outbursts of h  1743 - 322 , we extract light curves from pcu2 data of rxte / pca instrument in different energy bands : @xmath24 kev ( @xmath25 channels ) , @xmath26 kev ( @xmath27 channels ) , and @xmath28 kev ( @xmath29 channels ) .",
    "we have divided the @xmath28 kev energy band in the above two bands because @xmath24 kev photons mainly come from the thermally cool keplerian disk , whereas the photons in the higher energy band ( @xmath26 kev ) come from the comptonized sub - keplerian disk ( compton corona ) .",
    "this fact may not be true always because the contributions for different spectral components also depend on accretion states .",
    "variations of pca count rates in @xmath28 kev energy band and hardness ratios between @xmath26 kev and @xmath24 kev count rates of the 2010 and 2011 outbursts of h  1743 - 322 are shown in fig .",

    "2 , we plot a combined @xmath28 kev pca count rates of the 2010 and 2011 outbursts against x - ray color ( pca count ratio between @xmath26 kev and @xmath24 kev energy bands ) , which are well known as hid @xcite .",
    "the marked points @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are on mjd = @xmath38 , mjd = @xmath39 , mjd = @xmath40 , mjd = @xmath41 , mjd = @xmath42 , mjd = @xmath43 , mjd = @xmath44 , and mjd = @xmath45 respectively for the 2010 outburst . here points @xmath30 and @xmath37 respectively are the indicators of the start and the end of rxte observations for the outburst and the points @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the points on the days where the state transitions from hard @xmath46 hard intermediate , hard - intermediate @xmath46 soft - intermediate , soft - intermediate @xmath46 soft , soft @xmath46 soft - intermediate , soft - intermediate @xmath46 hard - intermediate , and hard - intermediate @xmath46 hard , respectively occurred .",

    "0.45 cm    in the figure , both the plots show similar nature and state transitions during the outburst , except that in the 2011 outburst , the pca count rate is observed to be lower in rising phase and higher in declining phase of the outburst . during both the outbursts , the rxte missed the initial rising days ( supposed to be in the hard state ) and the observational data was not available .",
    "recently , @xcite also studied hids of both the outbursts .",
    "however , their analysis does not include spectral modeling of hids . from the detailed temporal and spectral study of these outbursts of h  1743 - 322",
    ", we have been able to connect different branches of the hids with different spectral states ( see , figs . 2 , 6 , 7 ) . in the subsequent subsections ,",
    "the variations of the spectral properties during the outbursts along with the pos model fitted evolutions of qpo frequency during the rising and the declining phases of the outbursts are discussed .",
    "studying temporal variability and finding qpos in power density spectra ( pds ) is an important aspect for any black hole candidate ( bhc ) .",
    "it is observed ( mainly at hard and hard - int - ermediate spectral states ) that the frequency of qpos are seen to evolve with time .",
    "lfqpos are reported extensively in the literature , although there is some uncertainty about the origin of these qpos .",
    "so far , many models are introduced to explain the origin of this important temporal feature of bhcs , such as trapped oscillations and disko - seismology @xcite , oscillations of warped disks @xcite , accretion - ejection instability at the inner radius of the keplerian disk @xcite , global disk oscillations @xcite , and perturbations inside a keplerian disk @xcite , propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations in hotter inner disk flow @xcite , and oscillations from a transition layer in between the disk and hot comptonized flow @xcite .",
    "however , none of these models attempt to explain long duration continuous observations and the evolutions of qpos during the outburst phases of transient bhcs .",
    "one satisfactory model namely shock oscillation model ( som ) by chakrabarti and his collaborators @xcite , shows that the oscillation of x - ray intensity could be due to the oscillation of the post - shock ( comptonizing ) region . according to som ,",
    "shock wave oscillates either because of resonance ( where the cooling time scale of the flow is comparable to the infall time scale ; @xcite ) or because the rankine - hugoniot condition is not satisfied @xcite to form a steady shock .",
    "the qpo frequency is inversely proportional to the infall time ( @xmath63 ) in the post - shock region .",
    "the propagating oscillatory shock ( pos ) model , which can successfully explain the evolutions of qpo frequency , is nothing but a special case ( time varying form ) of som .    as explained in our earlier papers on pos model @xcite during the rising phase , the shock moves towards the black hole and during the declining phase it moves away from the black hole .",
    "this movement of the shock wave depends on the non - satisfaction of rankine - hugoniot condition which is due to the temperature and energy differences between pre- and post- shock regions .",
    "moreover , sometimes in soft - intermediate states , qpos are observed sporadically ( for e.g. , during the 2010 - 11 outburst of gx 339 - 4 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and vanishes in soft spectral states and reappears in declining intermediate / hard states . this disappearance and appearance of qpo frequency depends on the compression ratio ( @xmath64 ) due to the velocity / density difference in pre- and post- shock regions or could be due to the ejection of jets ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .when @xmath65 , i.e. , density of pre- and post- shock region more or less becomes the same , a shock wave vanishes , and so does the qpo .",
    "we now present the results of the evolution of qpo frequency observed in both rising and declining phases of both the outbursts .",
    "so far in the literature , there is no consensus on the origin of qpos despite its long term discovery @xcite , other than our group @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have tried to connect the nature of the observed qpos and their evolutions during the rising and the declining phases of the current outbursts with the same pos model and find their implications on accretion disk dynamics . from the fits , physical flow parameters , such as instantaneous location , velocity , and strengths of the propagating shock wave are extracted .",
    "detailed modeling and comparative study between qpo evolutions observed in the rising and the declining phases of the outbursts of transient bhcs will be presented in our follow - up works , where we will compare the pos model fit parameters with the spectral / temporal properties ( such as count rates , hardness ratios , spectral fluxes , photon indices etc . ) of the bhcs .",
    "this study can predict the mass of the bhcs , whose masses are not measured dynamically till now ( for e.g. , h 1743 - 322 ) . similarly , our study can predict the properties of qpos in subsequent days , once the data for the first few days is available .",
    "the monotonically increasing nature of qpo frequency ( from @xmath66  hz to @xmath67  hz for the 2010 outburst and from @xmath68  hz to @xmath69  hz for the 2011 outburst ) during the rising phases and the monotonically decreasing nature of qpo frequency ( from @xmath70  hz to @xmath71  hz for the 2010 outburst and from @xmath72  hz to @xmath73  hz for the 2011 outburst ) during the declining phases of the recent successive two outbursts of h  1743 - 322 are very similar to what is observed in the 2005 outburst of gro  j1655 - 40 @xcite , 1998 outburst of xte  j1550 - 564 @xcite , and 2010 outburst of gx  339 - 4 @xcite .",
    "this motivated us to study and compare these evolutions with the same pos model solution .",
    "we found that during the rising and the declining phases of these two outbursts of h 1743 - 322 , qpo evolutions also fit well with the pos model .",
    "the pos model fitted parameters ( for e.g. , shock location , strength , velocity etc . ) are consistent with the qpo evolutions of gro  j1655 - 40 , xte  j1550 - 564 , and gx  339 - 4 . the pos model fitted accretion flow parameters of the 2010 and 2011 outbursts of h  1743 - 322 are given in table 1 .",
    "only noticeable difference observed during the present qpo frequency evolutions of h  1743 - 322 with that of the 2005 outburst of gro  j1655 - 40 and 2010 - 11 outburst of gx  339 - 4 is that during both the rising phases of gro  j1655 - 40 and gx  339 - 4 outbursts , the shock was found to move in with a constant speed of @xmath74 , and @xmath75 respectively , whereas during the same phases of the current two outbursts of h  1743 - 322 , the shock was found to move in with an acceleration . on the other hand , during the declining phase for all these outbursts of gro  j1655 - 40 , gx  339 - 4 , and h  1743 - 322 , the shock was found to be moved away with constant acceleration .",
    "it is also noticed that during both the rising and the declining phases of the 2010 outburst , the shock moved away with an acceleration twice as compared to that of 2011 outburst .",
    "it seems to be an interesting result , which may occur due to the lack of supply of matter ( mostly keplerian ) into the disk from the companion that could have created a sudden ` void ' in the disk for the shock to move away rapidly outward .    according to the pos solution @xcite",
    ", one can obtain the qpo frequency if one knows the instantaneous shock location or vise - versa and the compression ratio ( @xmath64 = @xmath76/@xmath77 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the densities in the post- and the pre- shock flows ) at the shock . according to pos model in the presence of a shock @xcite , the infall time in the post - shock region",
    "is given by , @xmath78 where , @xmath79 is the shock location in units of the schwarzschild radius @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the velocity of propagating shock wave in @xmath82 .",
    "the qpo frequency happens to be inversely proportional to the in - fall time scale from the post - shock region . according to the shock oscillation model @xcite ,",
    "oscillations of the x - ray intensity are generated due to the oscillation of the post - shock region .",
    "this is also the centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ( or , cenbol ) which behaves as a compton cloud in the @xcite model of two component accretion flow ( tcaf ) . according to the numerical simulations of the sub - keplerian ( low - angular momentum ) accretion which includes the dynamical cooling @xcite or the thermal cooling @xcite , the frequency of the shock oscillation is similar to the observed qpo frequency for bhcs .",

    "the ` + ' ve sign in the second term is to be used for an outgoing shock in the declining phase and the ` - ' ve sign is to be used for the in - falling shock in the rising phase .",
    "when the velocity of the shock wave ( as in the rising phase of the 2005 gro j1655 - 40 outburst ) is constant , @xmath93 .",
    "for the accelerating case ( as in the rising and declining phases of the 2010 and 2011 outbursts of h 1743 - 322 ) @xmath81 is time - dependent and can be defined as @xmath94 , where @xmath47 is the acceleration of the shock front .    since in the presence of cooling ,",
    "the shock moves close to the black hole , at the rising phase of the outburst , where the cooling gradually increases due to rise of the keplerian rate , the shock wave moves towards the black hole and thus the qpo frequency rises on a daily basis .",

    "we carried out the temporal and the spectral analysis of the data of the 2010 and 2011 outbursts of the black hole candidate h  1743 - 322 .",
    "we studied the evolution of quasi - periodic oscillation frequency during the rising as well as the declining phases .",
    "we also studied the evolution of spectral states during both the outbursts .",
    "the variations of qpo frequencies can be fitted assuming that an oscillating shock wave progressively moves towards the black hole during the rising phase and moves away from the black hole in the declining phase .",
    "fundamentally , it is possible that a sudden rise in viscosity not only causes the keplerian rate to rise but also causes the inner edge to move towards the black hole .",
    "initially , the higher angular momentum flow forms the shock far away , but as the viscosity transports the angular momentum , the shock moves in , especially so due to enhanced cooling effects in the post - shock region . the keplerian disk moves in along with the shock .",
    "this scenario accomplishes all that we observe in an outbursting source : ( a ) the qpo frequency rises / decreases with time in the rising / declining phase , mainly observed during the hard and hard - intermediate spectral states and during the soft - intermediate spectral state qpos are seen sporadically ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is to be noted that shocks exist only in these states .",
    "( b ) the spectrum softens as the keplerian disk moves in with a higher rate .",
    "( c ) at the intermediate state(s ) , the keplerian and the sub - keplerian rates are similar .",
    "( d ) during the declining phase , when the viscosity is reduced , the shock and the keplerian disk moves back to a larger distance and the qpo frequency is also reduced .",
    "( e ) the outflows can form only from the post - shock region ( cenbol ) , namely , the subsonic region between the shock and the inner sonic point . in softer states ,",
    "the cenbol disappears and the outflows also disappear .",
    "our model predicts that since the qpos could be due to the oscillation of the shocks , whose frequency is roughly the inverse of the infall time scale , the frequency gives the location of the shock when the compression ratio is provided . in our scenario ,",
    "a strong shock ( @xmath162 ) starts at @xmath163 , but by the time it comes closer to the black hole , it becomes weaker due to the rapid cooling by enhanced keplerian disk rate .",
    "qpo ceases to exist when the compression ratio is unity .",
    "these constraints allowed us to compute the shock strength as a function of time .",
    "as far as the evolution of the spectral states during the two outbursts of the transient bhc h  1743 - 322 is concerned , this can be well understood by the detailed study of the spectral properties . during both the outbursts",
    ", it has been observed that the source starts from the hard state and finally return back to hard state again after passing through the hard - intermediate , soft - intermediate and soft spectral states .",
    "it completes hysteresis loop of @xmath164 .",
    "several attempts have already been made to understand these type of hysteresis spectral state transitions in black hole sources and to find their correlations with hids @xcite , but one can easily explain this type of evolution of spectral states with the tcaf model + @xcite , where the low - angular momentum sub - keplerian matter flows in nearly free - fall time scale , while the high angular momentum keplerian matter flows in the slow viscous time scale @xcite .",
    "initially the spectra are dominated by the sub - keplerian flow and as a result , the spectra are hard . as the day progresses , more and more sub - keplerian matter is converted to keplerian matter ( through viscous transport of angular momentum ) and the spectra become softer , progressively through hard - intermediate ( keplerian rate slightly less than the sub - keplerian rate ) , soft - intermediate ( keplerian rate comparable to the sub - keplerian rate ) and soft state ( dominating keplerian rate ) . when viscosity is turned off at the outer edge , the declining phase begins . at the declining phase of the outburst , the keplerian rate starts decreasing , and the spectra start to become harder again . however , the spectrum need not be retrace itself , since the information about the decrease of viscosity had to arrive at the viscous time scale .",
    "this causes a hysteresis effect .",
    "but the spectra still follows the declining soft - intermediate , hard - intermediate and hard states .    in this work",
    ", we successfully applied the pos model fit evolutions of qpo frequency during both the rising and declining phases of two ( 2010 and 2011 ) outbursts of h 1743 - 322 and shock wave parameters related to the evolutions are extracted .",
    "earlier , the same pos model was also applied to explain the evolution of qpo frequency of other black hole candidates ( e.g. , gro  j1655 - 40 , xte  j1550 - 564 , gx  339 - 4 , etc . ) very successfully @xcite .",
    "all these objects seem to exhibit a similar behaviour as far as the qpo and spectral evolutions are concerned . in future",
    ", we will carry out detailed modeling and comparative study between qpo evolutions observed in other outbursts of h  1743 - 322 and other transient bhcs with this pos model and hence to understand accretion flow behaviours during the outburst phases more precisely .",
    "however , the basic questions still remain : ( a ) what are the sources of enhanced viscosity ?",
    "( b ) does it scale with the mass of the black hole or the mass of the donor ?",
    "( c ) is the duration of the high viscosity phase ( i.e. , the duration between the end of the rising phase and the beginning of the declining phase ) predictable , or it is totally random and depends mostly on the physical conditions of the donor ?",
    "( d ) which processes decide the total time interval for which an outburst may last ? and finally ,",
    "( e ) what determines the interval between two outbursts ? if the cause is the enhancement of viscosity , then clearly it may be also random .",
    "we are in the process of exploring these aspects through comparison of all the known candidates .",
    "recently , we have been able to include tcaf model in xspec as a local additive model , and from the spectral fit using this model directly we obtain instantaneous location of the shock ( @xmath79 ) and compression ratio ( @xmath64 ) other than two component ( keplerian and sub - keplerian ) accretion rates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as we know from the pos model , one can determine the qpo frequency if the values of @xmath79 and @xmath64 are known or vise - versa ( see , eqn .",
    "so , from the spectral fit , we will be able to predict the observed qpo frequency . the preliminary result on this work is already presented in a conference proceeding @xcite .",
