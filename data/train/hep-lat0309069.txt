    "the @xmath8 meson consists of a charm and a strange quark .",
    "its direct simulation on the lattice is possible without having to use a chiral extrapolation for the light quark or an effective theory for the heavy quark ( e.g. hqet , nrqcd ) .",
    "therefore the @xmath8 is an ideal testing ground as its properties are expected to be similar to those of other heavy - light systems ( e.g. @xmath9 ) .    the decay constant @xmath0 parameterizes the leptonic decay of the @xmath8 meson into a pair of leptons with a @xmath10 as the intermediate vector boson .",
    "it is defined through the qcd matrix element @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the axial current .",
    "@xmath0 is an important input parameter to ckm - physics in phenomenology .",
    "together with a precise computation of the decay constant in the static approximation @xcite , it can also be used to investigate down to which heavy quark mass hqet can be applied safely . with this at hand",
    "one can then eventually get a reliable estimate for @xmath13 from an interpolation between the relativistic simulation and the static approximation @xcite .",
    "previous quenched results for @xmath0 have been summarized in @xcite , which gives a world average of @xmath14mev .",
    "@xcite is a recent calculation of @xmath0 with an alternative approach which gives a value of @xmath15mev .",
    "the pdg quotes @xmath16mev @xcite .",
    "the aim of this project is to obtain a precise value for the decay constant @xmath0 with a combined statistical and systematic error of 3% , apart from the quenched approximation .",
    "the systematic errors can be kept under control by using non - perturbative @xmath4-improvement @xcite and renormalization @xcite together with a well controlled approach to the continuum . in particular , we simulated at four different values of the lattice spacing between @xmath17fm .",
    "at the moment we simulate with an even finer lattice ( @xmath3fm ) and we plan to add the results to the analysis in the future .",
    "we also analyzed the systematic error due to the limited solver precision and the systematic error due to the contamination of the plateaus by excited states and glueballs .",
    "finite volume effects have been shown to be negligible at our choice of the lattice size and at our choices of the quark masses @xcite .",
    "our simulation parameters are based on previous work of the alpha - collaboration .",
    "we use the sommer scale @xcite with @xmath18fm to fix the lattice spacing .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this choice of @xmath19 is equivalent to setting the scale with the decay constant of the k - meson , @xmath5mev .",
    "the hopping parameters of the strange quark and the charm quark have been taken from publications @xcite on the corresponding renormalization group invariant masses for all values of the lattice spacing . in these works , @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "were determined using the masses @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the @xmath8- and k - meson as phenomenological input , while neglecting isospin breaking and using @xmath24 with @xmath25 from chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",

    "the fermionic boundary fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 are used to construct the mesonic boundary sources @xcite @xmath34 starting from the correlation function @xmath35 with the improved axial current @xmath36 , one derives the expression @xmath37 for the decay constant .",
    "a detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ fdsbare ]    here , @xmath38 renormalizes the axial current and the term linear in @xmath39 subtracts @xmath4-artefacts proportional to the bare subtracted quark mass @xmath40 .",
    "both coefficients were obtained non - perturbatively on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar mass @xmath41 is obtained as effective mass and @xmath42 normalizes one particle states . @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which cancels out the normalization on the boundary meson sources , have to be determined in the simulation .",
    "as @xmath43 decays exponentially with the pseudoscalar mass , one expects @xmath45 to exhibit a plateau at intermediate times , where the contributions @xmath46 of the first excited state and the contribution @xmath47 from the @xmath48 glueball both are small .",
    "a plateau average can then be performed to increase the signal .",
    "some simulation parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we set @xmath49 .",
    "all simulations were done at approximately constant physics , which is important for the scaling study .",
    "1 shows the simulation result for the unrenoramlized @xmath50 .",
    "the simulations for the first four values of @xmath26 were done in single precision arithmetics on the ape - machine at desy zeuthen . as we are dealing with heavy quark propagators , we have to check for rounding errors which may arise during the calculation",
    ". we also want to guarantee sufficient solver convergence for the propagators .",
    "the corresponding checks were done with an adapted version of the milc code @xcite on the ibm p690 computers at the hlrn @xcite .",
    "starting from the same field configuration , we calculated the propagators in single and double precision arithmetics and with different solver residuals .",
    "it turned out that the impact of these changes on @xmath0 is below 1 per mil .",
    "for the definition of plateau ranges of ( [ fdsformula ] ) where the relative contribution of excited states and glueballs is below a threshold of 5 per mil , one needs estimates of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these were obtained self - consistently from linear fits to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the average of an a priori chosen plateau ( cf .",
    "( [ fdsbare ] ) and @xcite for details ) .",
    "we found that a suitable range for the plateau is @xmath55 for all values of @xmath26 .",
    "( [ context ] ) shows the corresponding plateau averages for all simulated values of @xmath26 .",
    "we excluded the coarsest lattice in the continuum extrapolation which was done linear in @xmath56 because of @xmath4-improvement . with @xmath39 taken from @xcite we finally quote @xmath57 as the main result .",
    "we also used 1-loop perturbation theory for @xmath39 @xcite , since taking @xmath39 from @xcite involves an extrapolation of the data .",
    "one then gets @xmath58 . excluding the two coarsest lattices",
    "instead leads to @xmath59 .",
    "finally , using @xmath18fm , our main result in physical units is @xmath6mev .",
    "[ context ]    when using the nucleon mass to set the scale , which corresponds to taking @xmath60fm , we found that @xmath0 decreases by @xmath7mev @xcite .",
    "we present a direct calculation of the heavy - light decay constant @xmath0 with the final result @xmath6mev .",
    "the error matches that of future experiments , e.g. cleo - c .",
    "we aim at extending the scaling study in the future and these calculations are under way .",
    "we supplement this analysis with more data around the charm mass @xcite .",
    "we estimate that @xmath0 decreases by by @xmath7mev under a scale shift of 10% .",
