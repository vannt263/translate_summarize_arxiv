    "measurements of strangeness production in heavy - ion collisions were originally conceived to be the smoking gun of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation @xcite . it was argued that due to a drop in the strange quark s dynamical mass and increased production cross section , strangeness in the qgp would saturate on small time scales relative to a hadronic gas .",
    "twenty nine years since then , the production of strangeness continues to test our understanding of qcd in both p+p and heavy - ion collisions . in these proceedings , we review recent measurements of strange particle production at the star experiment .",
    "we first explore integrated yields in cu+cu and au+au collisions where production is expected to be dominated by low @xmath2 processes at rhic energies , then proceed to mid-@xmath3 spectra where fragmentation and recombination may compete .",
    "we then turn to strange particle @xmath4 and tests for non - equilibrium behaviour with respect to elliptic flow , then show test results for rhic s low energy program which will search for a possible critical point on the qcd phase diagram .",
    "finally , we show new results on strange particle fragmentation functions in p+p collisions .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the _ enhancement factor _ for strange particle yields in cu+cu and au+au @xmath5 gev collisions . assuming a thermally equilibrated qgp hadronises into a maximum entropy state , a test for strange quark saturation in the initial stages is provided by comparing the final hadron state yields to thermal model predictions from the canonical formalism @xcite . for all strange particles it is clear that for a given system , rises in the enhancement factor with @xmath6 are observed which is predicted by the canonical formalism .",
    "however , the enhancement factor appears to rise more rapidly in cu+cu collisions , and this is inconsistent with the canonical formalism which predicts the rise should just be controlled by @xmath7 independent of the collision system . that relies on a constant baryo - chemical potential and chemical freeze out temperature for both systems which has been shown @xcite .",
    "we also make comparisons to predictions from the ampt @xcite and epos @xcite models which have been shown to describe the bulk features of hadron production well for au+au @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "the ampt model is based on hijing , and thus describes particle production in heavy - ion collisions via intra - nucleon string excitation and breaking ( soft ) , and mini - jet fragmentation ( hard ) where the excited nucleons fragment independently .",
    "the epos model describes particle production with core and corona contributions .",
    "the core occupies the high density region in the collision zone and aims to mimic various qgp behaviour . at a particular freeze - out density ,",
    "the hadronisation is treated via statistical emission where strangeness production is over saturated ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "corona production occurs in the low density region and is a superposition of p+p collisions .",
    "both the ampt and epos models reproduce three key qualitative aspects of the data : rises in yields per @xmath6 for a given system , a faster rise in yields per @xmath6 for cu+cu collisions , and a merging in yields per @xmath6 for peripheral cu+cu and very peripheral au+au collisions .",
    "quantitatively , epos is nearly always closer to the measured data than ampt .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the enhancement factor for the @xmath9 particle in context of the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 enhancements . for both cu+cu and au+au collisions at energies of @xmath13 and @xmath14 gev , an above unity enhancement factor",
    "is observed which is also inconsistent with predictions from the canonical formalism @xcite , and this sits between the single and multi - strange values for au+au @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "an alternative core - corona approach has been shown to describe the @xmath9 enhancement factors in au+au @xmath5 gev collisions quite well @xcite , as has a more recent implementation of the epos model @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows thermal parameters extracted from particle ratios via the thermus model @xcite for p+p , cu+cu , and au+au @xmath5 gev collisions . in the left panel",
    "we observe that the chemical freeze - out temperature ( @xmath15 ) is independent of centrality and system , as mentioned previously . in the right panel",
    "we observe that the strangeness saturation factor ( @xmath16 ) , which characterises the deviation in strangeness production from thermal expectations , appears to lie on a common trend with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "strangeness saturation i.e. @xmath18 in both cu+cu and au+au appears to be reached at @xmath19 in this scheme .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "@xmath1 measurements characterise the conversion from the initial state anisotropy to momentum anisotropy , and thus may give information on the degree of rescattering in heavy - ion collisions . by implementing the boltzman equation , transport theory can determine the degree of non - equilibrium behaviour @xcite .",
    "this is quantified via the knudsen number @xmath20 which is the ratio of the mean free path length to the system size .",
    "non - equilibrium @xmath1 can be expressed as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the initial state eccentricity and @xmath23 a constant . when @xmath24 , @xmath4 is fully hydrodynamic like , and when @xmath25 , @xmath4 is below hydro expectations as the effects of a finite mean free path and/or finite system size are felt by the system .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig:5 ] shows @xmath3 integrated @xmath4 for strange and non - strange in cu+cu and au+au @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "the right panel shows the same data divided by the expected hydro value at the respective system density . the fitted transport curve shows the knudsen number decreases with increasing density and",
    "does not reach zero for the highest densities where the measured @xmath1 is @xmath26 below hydro expectations . amongst other things ,",
    "the apparent contradiction with earlier claims of ideal hydro behaviour results from eccentricity being better understood in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "various lattice qcd calculations predict a critical point where the qgp may hadronise via a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "this motivates a possible low energy scan ( @xmath27 gev ) at rhic that aims to cover the most recent predictions of temperature and baryo - chemical potential where the critical point may occur .",
    "furthermore , as a collider experiment , star s constant acceptance with respect to beam energy gives it an advantage over its fixed target    counterparts where other searches maybe carried out .",
    "earlier this year , star recorded @xmath28 events from au+au @xmath29 gev collisions as a feasibility test for low energy running .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig:6 ] for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 ratios .",
    "it is clear that star has already achieved global consistency with other experimental results .",
    "the same is found to be true for the integrated mid - rapidity @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ratios , and the @xmath35 and @xmath31 ratios from au+au @xmath36 gev collisions recorded in 2000 @xcite .",
    "we finally turn to strange particle fragmentation functions measured in p+p @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "these provide an essential reference for understanding strangeness production from jets in heavy - ion collisions , and offer constraints to various qcd inspired jet fragmentation models .",
    "figure [ fig:7 ] shows fragmentation functions for the charged hadron , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 particles at three different jet energies .",
    "the fragmentation function is expressed in terms of @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the reconstructed jet energy , and the respective probability function is normalised by the number of jets in the energy range studied . for a particular particle species ,",
    "the integral of the function gives the mean number per jet over a chosen range in @xmath41 .",
    "there are two key observations to be made from the data in figure [ fig:7 ] for all jet energies .",
    "firstly , it was found that for the particle species studied , the mean @xmath41 violated a predicted mass ordering expected in qcd @xcite .",
    "secondly , for a hadron of @xmath42 gev / c , it was found that the @xmath43 ratio @xmath44 . since p+p events with higher values of @xmath45 are more likely to contain a hard scattered parton @xcite , this observation is supported by the fact that the inclusive mid-@xmath46 @xmath43 ratio approaches one with increasing @xmath45 @xcite . taken at face value , this readdresses the question of exactly what is a jet - like baryon / meson ratio , with the answer being crucial for heavy - ion studies in the mid-@xmath0 range .",
    "finally , it must be noted that the accuracy of each of the measurements behind the respective observations is still under evaluation .",
    "we have presented recent results for strange particle @xmath47 in cu+cu and au+au collisions and found for the collision energy of @xmath5 gev , both the epos and ampt models reproduce qualitative features of the data with epos doing better quantitatively . it was shown that baryon - meson differences occur for @xmath48 in cu+cu @xmath5 gev collisions , and that a recombination model describes the @xmath3 dependance of the @xmath49 ratio for central cu+cu collisions at the same energy .",
    "strange and non - strange particle @xmath4 were found to exhibit non - equilibrium behaviour for cu+cu and au+au @xmath5 gev at all centralities , and star s recent low energy run gave @xmath50 ratios consistent with other experiments .",
    "strange particle fragmentation functions were presented for p+p @xmath5 gev collisions , and these showed a breaking of the expected mean @xmath41 mass ordering and a mid-@xmath0 ( @xmath51 gev / c ) @xmath43 ratio of @xmath44 in jets for the kinematic range studied .",
