    "the observational evidence of the accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite have been the main reason for a revision of the cosmological evolution as predicted by general relativity ( gr ) and the standard model of elementary particles . in principle , this problem can be circumvented either by introducing a term representing a new kind of universal fluid , the so - called dark energy , in the einstein equations or by considering modifications and extensions of the einstein theory of gravity .",
    "a particular extension of gr , known as @xmath0 gravity , has received a lot of attention in the last years , mainly from the cosmological viewpoint .",
    "the paradigm consists in relaxing the hypothesis that the action of gravitational interaction is strictly linear in the ricci scalar @xmath1 , as in the case of the hilbert - einstein action , and assuming a general function of @xmath1 that can be fixed by observations and experiments .",
    "the cosmological interest in @xmath0 gravity comes from the fact that these theories naturally exhibit a late accelerating expansion of the universe without need of exotic matter fields such as dark energy ( for reviews on this subject , see ref .",
    "much effort has been expended so far in order to limit the freedom of different functional forms which are possible for @xmath0 models .",
    "recently , observational constraints from several cosmological data sets have been explored  @xcite .",
    "general principles such as nonlocal causal structure  @xcite , energy conditions  @xcite , have also been taken into account in order to restrict the solution space and to clarify some of subtleties related to @xmath0 gravity .",
    "an important aspect worth emphasizing when discussing this issue is that the energy conditions were initially formulated by hawking and ellis in the context of gr  @xcite . as already noted by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 models are described in the so - called jordan frame while einstein s gravity is formulated in the einstein frame .",
    "however , it can be shown that any @xmath0 theory is mathematically equivalent , via conformal transformation , to einstein s gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field  @xcite .",
    "perhaps guided by these studies , some authors have translated the energy conditions directly from gr , imposing them on an effective pressure and effective energy density defined by the related effective energy - momentum tensor  @xcite . in order to test the viability of such a procedure , the authors of ref . @xcite generalized the energy conditions for @xmath0 gravity which has been followed by many authors ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and generalized to other modified theories of gravity  @xcite .",
    "other approaches , however , consider the new terms appearing in the equations of motion must be understood as possessing geometrical meaning only  @xcite . indeed , the physical connection between conformal frames , or , in other words , the problem whether the physical information contained in the theory is preserved under conformal transformations , is still a contentious issue  @xcite .    in this paper , following the investigation of ref .",
    "@xcite and the developments presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the strong energy condition ( sec ) in the framework of @xmath0 gravity and use recent estimated values of deceleration , jerk and snap cosmographic parameters of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) flat geometry to impose bounds on the parameters of a paradigmatic class of @xmath0 gravity models .",
    "we also address the attractive / non - attractive character of @xmath0 gravity by deriving explicit bounds on some physical quantities in a flat frw geometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii discuss the raychaudhuri equation where , in particular , we point out the role of the curvature in order to obtain focusing or defocusing bundles of geodesics .",
    "@xmath0 gravity and strong energy condition are presented in sec .",
    "specifically , we explicit the relation between the mean gaussian curvature of geodesic surfaces , the raychaudhuri equation and the field equations of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "this relation allows to set conditions for acceleration / deceleration for the given models . sec .",
    "iv consists of a cosmographic analysis in frw geometry .",
    "the observed values of cosmographic parameters allows to fix @xmath2 models in view of accelerated / decelerated expansion .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "v. we use a metric signature @xmath3 and our definition of the riemann tensor is @xmath4 , @xmath5 defines the ricci tensor and @xmath6 is the ricci scalar .",
    "when examining the whole spacetime structure without specific solutions of einstein s equations , the raychaudhuri equation  @xcite plays a central role in the understanding of the gravitational attraction .",
    "such an evolution equation describes the geodesic motion of nearby particles without making assumptions about homogeneity and isotropy of the spacetime . in gr , without a cosmological constant , particular energy conditions  indeed the strong energy condition  has to be assumed in order to guarantee the attractive character of the theory  @xcite .",
    "positive contributions coming from the spacetime geometry to the raychaudhuri equation are usually interpreted as violation of the sec or the null energy conditions requirements  @xcite . in the context of @xmath0 gravity , however , we may have a positive contribution to raychaudhuri equation even assuming these standard energy conditions , which gives the possibility of a repulsive character of this kind of gravity ( we will discuss this point later ) .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation for a congruence of timelike geodesics and its tangent vector field @xmath7 is written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 are respectively the expansion , shear and twist of the congruence of geodesics , and @xmath10 is the proper time of an observer moving along a geodesic .",
    "it is worth stressing that ( [ raychaudhuri tempo ] ) gives the expansion rate of the congruences as seen by comoving observers and , due to its spatial character , the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are non - negative scalars over a given spatial section . for the contribution of the term @xmath13 , there appear three possibilities : negative , positive or zero contribution , depending both on the point of the manifold and on the direction of the vector @xmath14 at that point .",
    "however , it can be shown that the expression @xmath13 is related to the gaussian curvature @xmath15 of the geodesic surface generated by @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the sum of all the gaussian curvatures of the geodesic surfaces is @xmath18 , which is called  the mean curvature of the space \" in the direction @xmath16 by eisenhart in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we denote it simply as @xmath19 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "although the eq . ( [ raychaudhuri tempo ] ) has only geometrical meaning , once one chooses a particular theory of gravitation , its contribution , via the field equations of motion to the kinematic of the congruences , is carried out through the terms @xmath20 . a negative contribution to raychaudhury equation ( focusing , @xmath21 )",
    "is usually interpreted as manifestation of the attractive character of the theory of gravity .",
    "the contribution of @xmath22 has then a clear geometrical interpretation  @xcite which is resumed as :    * @xmath23 positive contribution ( a condition necessary but not sufficient to geodesic defocusing ) ; * @xmath24 negative contribution ( geodesic focusing ) ; * @xmath25 zero contribution .    in what follows",
    "we consider congruence of geodesics for which @xmath26 and rewrite equation ( [ raychaudhuri tempo ] ) as @xmath27 from this formula it is clear the role of @xmath22 , in raychaudhuri equation , for the focusing or defocusing the congruence of geodesics .",
    "a positive contribution from @xmath28 is a necessary condition to get accelerated expansion and , also if it is not a sufficient condition , it may lead to non - attractive gravity .",
    "in fact , as commented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the raychaudhuri equation can either use the congruences to provide information on the ricci tensor , and hence on the stress - energy tensor , via the equations of motion , or can use the stress - energy tensor to provide information about the congruences . as",
    "the ricci tensor is in general unknown from the beginning theory of gravity . ] , we take a step forward by using the gravitational field equations and imposing the sec on the stress - energy tensor in order to provide information about the congruences .",
    "we intend to test the limit of attractiveness / non - attractiveness of @xmath0 gravity adopting the sec as a physical paradigm .",
    "the action that defines an @xmath0 gravity is given by @xmath29 + s_m\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the determinant of the metric tensor and @xmath32 is the standard action for the matter fields .",
    "varying the action  ( [ actionjf ] ) with respect to the metric , we obtain the field equations @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and the stress - energy tensor is defined as @xmath35 contracting the equation ( [ einstein - modified ] ) with @xmath36 , where @xmath14 is a normalized timelike vector ( @xmath37 ) , and taking into account its trace , we obtain , according to our definition for @xmath22 , the expression @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the trace of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the sec and the null energy condition ( nec ) state that  @xcite    * @xmath40 ; * @xmath41 ,    where @xmath42 is a null vector . for a perfect fluid , characterized by a density @xmath43 and a pressure @xmath44 ,",
    "the sec states that we must have , besides @xmath45 , the sum @xmath46 , while the nec implies that @xmath47  @xcite . in gr",
    "the observed accelerated expansion of the universe implies violation of the sec . since the requirement of nec",
    "is also contained in the sec , in what follows we consider in our study only the sec restrictions . imposing the sec to the standard cosmological fluids in the expression ( [ secf2 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath48 which we interpret as an upper bound to the contribution of spacetime geometry ( gravity ) to the raychaudhuri equation related to timelike geodesics .",
    "observe that , for @xmath49 , which gives the einstein equations of gr with a cosmological constant @xmath50 ( see eq .",
    "( [ einstein - modified ] ) ) , we get from ( [ mean curvature time2 ] ) that @xmath51 .",
    "hence we have that , for timelike geodesics , a positive contribution to the raychaudhuri equation from spacetime geometry ( @xmath52 ) is possible provided @xmath53 .",
    "it corresponds to the correct sign of @xmath50 which provides cosmic acceleration in the standard @xmath50cdm model .",
    "thus , if one considers gr as a @xmath49 theory of gravity , accelerated cosmic expansion is possible without violating the sec . for a more general @xmath0 gravity , even assuming the validity of the sec , the sign of @xmath54 still remains undetermined , and one has the possibility of a non - attractive gravity in these theories .",
    "we shall explore this possibility in the next section and look for cosmographic constraints in the geometrical background of a flat frw metric .",
    "equation ( [ mean curvature time2 ] ) is an upper bound to the contribution of spacetime geometry obtained by imposing the sec inequality .",
    "here we use this inequality , together with known values of the so called cosmographic parameters , in order to examine the attractive / non - attractive character of a given @xmath0 model in the context of frw flat geometry . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered a general congruence of timelike geodesics and examined the conditions to have @xmath55 . here",
    "we consider the fundamental congruence of geodesics in frw as the one where the observer is comoving , that is , @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the equation ( [ mean curvature time2 ] ) can be written as @xmath57 we want to investigate such a bound in terms of the cosmographic parameters , i.e. the hubble @xmath58 , deceleration @xmath59 , jerk @xmath60 , and snap @xmath61 parameters , defined respectively as @xmath62 firstly we have to express the ricci scalar and its derivatives in terms of these parameters : @xmath63 after some calculations , and using the relations ( [ ricci scalar jerk ] ) , we can write @xmath64 in terms of the cosmographic parameters for a general form of @xmath0 : @xmath65 where the coefficients @xmath66 are given in terms of the cosmographic parameters as @xmath67 inequality ( [ geral4time ] ) is valid at any time , to the extent that the sec is also valid at any time .    in the case of a frw geometry , we have @xmath68 so that the raychaudhuri equation reduces to @xmath69 note that gr implies @xmath70 and , from eq .",
    "( [ secf2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath71 for a perfect fluid considered as the matter source . thus , in gr with a frw geometry ( @xmath72 $ ] ) , the raychaudhuri equation gives @xmath73 , showing that geodesic defocusing only appears if @xmath74 .",
    "however , for theories of gravity more general than gr , we can have , from ( [ raychaudhuri_rw1 ] ) , that @xmath75 , turning @xmath76 positive even for @xmath77 .",
    "this contributes to a non - attractive character of gravity in these theories , and also affect the proof of the celebrated singularity theorems due to penrose , hawking and geroch in raychaudhuri equation play a key role in the proof of some singularity theorems  @xcite . ] .",
    "while the action ( [ actionjf ] ) may not represent the final theory of modified gravity , it could contain the information necessary to act as an effective field theory capable of describing correctly the phenomenology of gravitation . in this case , a particular @xmath0 model , seen as an effective field theory ,",
    "may have a limited region of applicability .",
    "this means to lose general prescription and to obtain results valid only to the considered @xmath0 function .",
    "alternatively , one could restrict to analytic @xmath0 functions so that it can be expanded about a certain @xmath78 as a power series @xmath79 several models of cosmological interest can be expressed as ( [ power - series ] ) . however , as a case to study , in order to explicit our calculations and understand the contribution of spacetime geometry according to the free parameters of a given @xmath0 theory of gravitation , in what follows we will use the inequality ( [ geral4time ] ) to examine the behavior of the paradigmatic class of @xmath0 models given by @xmath80 this class of @xmath0 gravity encompass a wide variety of proposals in the scientific literature .",
    "for instance , starobinsky considered in @xcite the case with @xmath81 as a viable scenario of primordial inflation .",
    "more recently , the same case was considered in @xcite as a possibility of explaining dark matter .",
    "the case @xmath82 , specially for @xmath83 , was presented in @xcite as a possible mechanism to provide cosmological acceleration ; although it is currently ruled out due to the so called dolgov - kawasaki instability  @xcite . in  @xcite",

    "we examine the behaviour of this class of models in what concerns the magnitude of @xmath84 and @xmath86 and the cosmographic parameters .    taking into account the first of the relations ( [ ricci scalar jerk ] )",

    "it is worth noticing that inequality ( [ mean - curvature_time ] ) was derived assuming that the sec holds over all the cosmological eras and that the theory of gravity can be described by action ( [ actionjf ] ) with @xmath0 given by ( [ paradig ] ) . as such , it can be used to impose bounds on the free parameters of the class ( [ paradig ] ) of @xmath0 models based only on the sec and present day ( @xmath106 ) estimated values of cosmographic parameters . in this case the inequality ( [ mean - curvature_time ] ) reduces to @xmath107 where the coefficients of @xmath98 are given by ( [ a_coeff])([b_coeff ] ) taken at @xmath106 . inequality ( [",

    "<S> the raychaudhuri equation enables to examine the whole spacetime structure without specific solutions of einstein s equations , playing a central role for the understanding of the gravitational interaction in cosmology . in general relativity , without considering a cosmological constant , a non - positive contribution in the raychaudhuri equation is usually interpreted as the manifestation of the attractive character of gravity . in this case , particular energy conditions  indeed the strong energy condition  must be assumed in order to guarantee the attractive character . in the context of @xmath0 gravity , however , even assuming the standard energy conditions one may have a positive contribution to the raychaudhuri equation . besides providing a simple way to explain the observed cosmic acceleration , this fact opens the possibility of a repulsive character of this kind of gravity . in order to discuss physical bounds on @xmath0 models , we address the attractive / non - attractive character of @xmath0 gravity considering the raychaudhuri equation and assuming the strong energy condition along with recent estimates of the cosmographic parameters . </S>"
