    "the wave equation @xmath1 on general lorentzian background metrics @xmath2 appears ubiquitously in mathematical physics , often in the context of the linearisation of a field theory governed by a system of non - linear hyperbolic p.d.e.s .",
    "the most classical example occurs perhaps in the context of the euler equations of fluid mechanics , in which case @xmath2 represents the so - called acoustical metric .",
    "another important source for @xmath3 arises from problems in general relativity , where @xmath2 represents the metric of spacetime , and @xmath3 can be viewed as a poor - man s linearisation of the einstein equations . for such metrics @xmath2 ,",
    "the global causal structure is often much richer than that of minkowski space . in this context ,",
    "perhaps the most interesting examples are so - called `` black hole '' metrics .",
    "briefly , these are metrics which  like minkowski space  possess a natural asymptotic structure representing future null infinity @xmath4 , but where the past of @xmath4 has a non - trivial complement in the spacetime .",
    "a fundamental problem for @xmath3 on suitable metrics @xmath2 is to obtain `` decay estimates '' , that is to say , estimates giving upper bounds for the rates of decay for @xmath5 toward the future , in terms of quantities computable initially on a cauchy surface .",
    "this classical problem can be studied as an end in itself , but it is often an essential step in proving stability results for non - linear equations which give rise to @xmath3 as described above . from the latter point of view , there is an important trade off between how much decay one proves and how robust is the argument to prove it .",
    "the history of non - linear wave equations in the past 30 years , culminating in part in the monumental stability proofs ( see for instance  @xcite ) based on robust estimates for equations of the form @xmath3 , are a testament to how important it is to get this balance right .",
    "the now standard approach to obtaining robust decay estimates proceeds by using weighted multiplier estimates ( going back to morawetz  @xcite ) and weighted commutators ( going back to klainerman  @xcite ) , both originating in one form or another from the symmetries of minkowski space . in minkowski space ,",
    "full use of this method ( applying both weighted multipliers and weighted commutators ) obtains ( a ) weighted energy decay , which can be expressed for instance as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes angular derivatives , ( b ) pointwise decay for @xmath5 of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents a higher order weighted energy at @xmath10 , and ( c ) pointwise estimates for derivatives of @xmath5 , with additional decay , for instance : @xmath11 as a multiplier .",
    "obtaining the full ( b ) and ( c ) requires both use of inverted time translations and commutation with the full algebra of commutators associated to @xmath12 .",
    "various applications to non - linear problems and other geometric settings have required variants of the vector field method where the use of certain vector field multipliers and/or commutators is avoided and less information is obtained concerning ( a ) , ( b ) , or ( c ) above .",
    "klainerman and sideris  @xcite obtained decay results by commuting only with @xmath13 and angular momentum operators , and this , used together with integrated local decay estimates in the style of morawetz  @xcite , has proven useful in a number of problems concerning obstacles , multiple speeds , etc .",
    "@xcite . a common feature of all these approaches , however , is the necessity of always applying at least some multipliers or commutators with weights growing in @xmath0 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we give a related but different approach to the problem of proving suitable decay estimates for solutions to @xmath3 which , as we shall see , has in principle a wider range of validity and may be even more useful for non - linear problems . in particular",
    ", the method here avoids both multipliers and commutators with weights in @xmath0 .",
    "our approach does not start from scratch , but begins with certain `` more basic '' estimates as ingredients , estimates which have already been proven ( either classically or much more recently ) in many cases of interest , by various methods .",
    "the method by which these ingredient estimates are obtained is in fact of no importance for the considerations here .",
    "as we shall see , our approach applies to the study of @xmath3 on minkowski space and sufficiently small perturbations thereof , but also to schwarzschild and kerr black hole spacetimes , and immediately yields essentially the decay consistent with non - linear stability . the common feature which these regimes share are    a.   an integrated local energy decay estimate [ ide ] b.   good asymptotics towards null infinity allowing for a hierarchy of @xmath14-weighted energy identities c.   uniform boundedness of energy [ iide ]    estimates of the form  ( [ ide ] ) , already referred to above ,",
    "were first proven by morawetz  @xcite for perturbations of minkowski space , while for schwarzschild , estimates of the form  ( [ ide ] ) are due to several authors ( see section  4.4.1 of  @xcite ) . for slowly rotating kerr spacetimes",
    "@xmath15 with parameters @xmath16 , such estimates have been shown by  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , whereas , for the general sub - extremal kerr case @xmath17 , this will appear in a forthcoming paper . in the black hole case , the `` integrated decay '' estimate ( [ ide ] ) , to be useful here , must be understood in the sense of an estimate which does not degenerate at the horizon @xmath18 , an estimate which is indeed possible in view of a multiplier construction intimately connected to the celebrated red - shift effect ( see  @xcite ) . in the schwarzschild and kerr case , the integrated decay estimate necessarily degenerates , however , near the analogue of the photon sphere , and this loss is related to the trapping phenomenon ; a non - degenerate estimate can nevertheless be obtained after losing differentiability .",
    "similar phenomena occur in the simpler setting of obstacle problems in minkowski space , to which this method also applies .",
    "we note that the hierarchy of @xmath14-weighted energy identities ( ii ) applied here corresponds to the use of a multiplier of the form @xmath19 for @xmath20 .    in principle",
    ", our approach can retrieve the `` full decay statements '' of the traditional vector field method as would follow from the combined use of  @xcite and  @xcite , except that the energy decay statements will in general lose derivatives if the integrated local energy decay statement does so . in this short note , we shall here only give the first step of the approach .",
    "this begins by obtaining @xmath21 decay of the energy flux through a suitable foliation @xmath22 ( whose leaves approach null infinity ) , where @xmath23 is the natural parameter of the foliation .",
    "this is precisely the analogue of  .",

    "we mention finally a forthcoming fourier - based method of tataru and collaborators for obtaining pointwise estimates for stationary metrics starting again from ( i ) and good asymptotic behaviour of the metric .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the `` full vector field method '' yields faster pointwise decay of the form @xmath148 .",
    "one way to prove such a result starting from our @xmath133 would be to apply one commutation with the scaling vector field @xmath13 .",
    "( see work of luk  @xcite for the schwarzschild case . )",
    "this would be contrary , however , to the philosophy of our current approach , which is to avoid any multipliers and commutators with weights in @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that our approach can in fact be extended to yield more decay without such commutations , by instead commuting with @xmath75 ( again understood in a null @xmath76 coordinate system ) , and @xmath134 which allows applying the hierarchy of estimates or   for larger weights in @xmath14 , i.e.  for larger values of the parameter @xmath147 .",
    "this leads to additional decay for a higher - order energy flux through @xmath22 , which can then be transformed into the usual decay for @xmath5 using also ideas of  @xcite .",
    "this will be discussed in a forthcoming follow - up paper .",
