    "<S> we show that the effects of neutrino oscillations on @xmath0b solar neutrinos are described well by the first two moments ( the average and the variance ) of the energy distribution of scattered or recoil electrons . for the superkamiokande and the sudbury neutrino observatory experiments , the differences between the moments calculated with oscillations and the standard , no - oscillation moments are greater than 3 standard deviations for a significant fraction of the neutrino mass - mixing @xmath1 parameter space . </S>"
