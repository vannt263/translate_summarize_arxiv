    "symmetries play an instrumental role in quantum field theory to ensure that massless particles at the classical level remain massless against quantum loop effects .",
    "for instance , massless vector bosons in yang ",
    "mills theories stay massless , as a consequence of the gauge symmetry of the effective action .",
    "this fact can be understood more easily within the gauge - invariant framework of the background field method @xcite , in which a non - zero mass for the background yang  mills vector boson is forbidden to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "likewise , massless fermions can be protected from receiving a non - zero mass due to chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "scalar particles can also stay massless to all orders , as a result of symmetries .",
    "for example , massless scalar particles could result from the spontaneous breakdown of a global goldstone symmetry  @xcite .",
    "other potential symmetries leading to massless scalar particles are supersymmetry  @xcite or classical scaling ( conformal ) symmetries  @xcite .",
    "such symmetries have been extensively discussed within the context of a related problem in the standard model ( sm ) , the so - called gauge - hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to shed light on the mechanism that protects the spin-2 graviton from receiving a non - zero mass beyond the tree level . in this context",
    ", we should mention that matter contributions to the graviton self - energy have already been studied in the past to a great extent  @xcite .",
    "however , in our opinion , the actual mechanism that lies behind the masslessness of the graviton has not yet been adequately elucidated . in particular",
    ", a radiatively generated graviton mass will affect the scattering of two scalar fields beyond the tree level .",
    "such calculations are relevant to the study of the quantum corrected newtonian potential and may be in conflict with well - established observations .",
    "it is therefore important to state here that the gauge or diffeomorphisms invariance of the effective action , even within the linearized framework of perturbative quantum gravity ( pqg ) , is not sufficient by itself to guarantee that the graviton remains massless against quantum loop corrections .",
    "specifically , the cosmological constant term is invariant under diffeomorphisms and contains a mass term for the graviton . at the tree level , this problem is resolved ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) after imposing the equations of motion with respect to the background graviton field , with the aid of which a would - be graviton mass can be removed . beyond the tree approximation",
    ", however , the masslessness of the graviton is not an obvious property , as this problem becomes strongly interrelated with the renormalization of the cosmological constant @xmath1 .    in quantum field theory",
    ", the pole position of a particle propagator encodes all the information about the mass of the particle . as we will show in this paper , the cosmological constant @xmath1 plays an important role , as it receives radiative corrections independently of the graviton propagator .",
    "these corrections are divergent and must be renormalized , or otherwise naturally suppressed , to give the small value of @xmath1 that we observe in the present epoch  @xcite . upon suitable renormalization of the cosmological constant @xmath1 to a flat ( minkowski ) background metric",
    ", the generated counterterm  ( ct ) @xmath2 enters the graviton self - energy explicitly within our linearized framework of pqg .",
    "we find that the masslessness property of the graviton is protected by a shift symmetry which is present in any diffeomorphisms invariant theory described by a flat background metric .",
    "the absence of the graviton mass will be explicitly demonstrated at the one - loop level in pqg within the context of an abelian higgs model .",
    "given that the framework of pqg is non - renormalizable @xcite , we follow the general lore and treat general relativity ( gr ) as an effective field theory  @xcite with a characteristic ultra - violet ( uv ) scale equal to the planck mass  @xmath3 .",
    "much work has been done within this effective field - theoretic framework , including pqg corrections to the newtonian and coulomb potentials , as well as one - loop calculations of graviton - mediated scatterings between matter fields in the non - relativistic limit @xcite .",
    "taking into account the contributions from the graviton and from massless fields of different spin , the established analytic result for the newtonian potential @xmath4 , between two masses @xmath5 and  @xmath6 being at distance @xmath0 apart , may be cast into the form  @xcite : @xmath7\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is newton s constant and @xmath9 is the number of fields with spin @xmath10 ( scalar ) @xmath11 ( weyl fermion)@xmath12 ( vector boson ) in units of @xmath13 .",
    "note that the first two terms in   correspond to the classical and quantum graviton contributions to the newtonian potential @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the leading radiative corrections to @xmath4 come from the so - called _ non - analytic _ parts of the amplitude , which diverge in the infra - red ( ir ) limit of vanishing 3-momenta for the external gravitationally - scattered fields . using a similar approach ,",
    "we compute the general matter loop corrections to the graviton propagator , as well as the modifications to the newtonian potential @xmath4 .",
    "the matter contributions to @xmath4 at the one - loop level effect only the graviton self - energy in a generic @xmath14 scattering process .",
    "thus , we shall show that the contributions of _ massive _ matter fields to the resummed graviton self - energies become relevant in the non - relativistic limit and therefore contribute to the newtonian potential .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "after this introductory section , section [ tf ] presents a gauged abelian higgs model with minimal coupling to gravity .",
    "this model serves as an illustrative example , which will help us to define our theoretical pqg framework that can include scalars , fermions and spin-1 fields .",
    "based on this framework , we discuss the properties of the corresponding diffeomorphically invariant path integral for the gauged abelian higgs model .",
    "given  that the model has no gravitational anomalies  @xcite , we derive the master ward identity  ( wi ) associated with the invariance of the path integral under diffeomorphisms .    in section [ cc ] , we study the minimization conditions pertinent to the one - loop effective action , where the renormalization of the cosmological constant  @xmath1 plays a key role to the renormalization of the graviton tadpole graphs . to further illuminate this deep connection",
    ", we derive a low - energy theorem that involves graviton correlation functions to all orders in perturbation theory . this graviton low energy theorem  ( glet )",
    "may also be utilized to obtain a non - perturbative relation between the tadpole contributions and the graviton self - energy at zero external momentum .    in section [ mc ] , we calculate the matter contributions to the graviton self - energy for the gauged abelian higgs model with minimal coupling to gravity . to deal with uv infinities , we adopt the method of dimensional regularisation  @xcite .",
    "we then proceed to renormalize the _ massive _ matter - field contributions to the graviton self - energy , after properly including the cosmological constant ct @xmath15 , as well as higher - dimensional planck - suppressed operators of the riemann tensor .",
    "we thus show that the graviton field acquires no mass at the one - loop level .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate how this result persists to all orders , as a consequence of the glet and the wi due to invariance of the path integral under diffeomorphisms .    in section [ np ] , we first review the tree - level calculation for the gravitationally mediated scattering process between two scalar fields , where the classical part of the newtonian potential @xmath4 is recovered .",
    "we then incorporate the self - energy contributions to the graviton propagator , which is used to determine the matter quantum corrections to the newtonian potential .",
    "our analytic results are expressed in terms of modified bessel and struve functions of the particle masses in the loop . in the massless limit of the loop masses , we reproduce the analytic result given in  , for particles with spin @xmath16 . in the same section , we comment on the independence of @xmath4 on the gravitational gauge - fixing parameters , as well as on gauge - fixing parameters due to gauge bosons in the loop .",
    "section  [ concl ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "finally , relevant feynman rules and other technical details that were useful in our computations have been presented in appendix  [ fr ] .",
    "in this section , we first outline our theoretical framework within the context of an abelian higgs model with minimal coupling to gravity , by making use of the background field method .",
    "we then write down the generating functional for this model and discuss its invariance under transformations of diffeomorphism . from the latter ,",
    "we derive a master wi for diffeomorpshims , which gives rise to an important wi that relates the graviton self - energy to the graviton tadpole graphs to all orders in perturbation theory .    to begin with ,",
    "we write down the action @xmath17 of an abelian higgs model minimally coupled to gravity as a sum of two terms : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hilbert ",

    "we will explicitly demonstrate how the relation  ( [ eq : tadpolecosmocancellation ] ) holds true to all orders in perturbation . as we will see , this non - perturbative relation is a direct consequence of a graviton low energy theorem ( glet ) .",
    "given the conceptual similarity of the glet with the so - called higgs - boson low energy theorem ( hlet )  @xcite , we begin our demonstration by briefly reminding the reader of the latter .",
    "the hlet may be stated by the following defining equation : @xmath186 where @xmath187 denotes a zero - momentum background higgs field .",

    ", one consequence of the hlet relevant to our discussion here is the relation of the higgs - boson tadpole to quantum effects on the higgs - boson mass .",
    "we may now try to extend the basic idea of hlet to theories of quantum gravity .",
    "as discussed in section  [ tf ] , the full spacetime metric @xmath60 may be decomposed in the bfm framework of quantum gravity as follows : @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the background metric [ cf .  ] . in close analogy to hlet , it is not difficult to observe that there is a similar symmetry for the effective action @xmath108 of the complete matter - gravity theory . in particular , the effective action @xmath108 remains invariant under the shift transformations : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is an arbitrary tensor .",
    "since the generating functional ( [ eq : generatingfunctionaldef ] ) remains invariant under the shift symmetry  , we can derive the shift ward identity : @xmath197 which implies @xmath198 by virtue of  ( [ eq : connectedgeneratingfunctionaldef ] ) . with the aid of  ( [ eq : effectiveactiondef ] )",
    ", we may translate the last result into the shift wi for the effective action : @xmath199 or equivalently in momentum space : @xmath200 equation   is the defining equation for the glet , where @xmath201 is a zero - momentum graviton field .",

    "hence , the one - loop relation ( [ eq : tadpolecosmocancellation ] ) is a consequence of the  glet .",
    "in addition to relating the graviton tadpole to the cosmological constant , the glet can also relate the graviton tadpole to the graviton self - energy at zero external momentum : @xmath205 since graviton tadpoles vanish identically for massless fields in the loop in the dr scheme , the graviton self - energy at zero external momentum will vanish as well , by means of  .",
    "consequently , the glet   can also guarantee the masslessness of the graviton field in dr , if all particles in the quantum loops are massless .",

    "in this section , we will first demonstrate explicitly how upon renormalization , the graviton self - energy obeys the property of transversality entailing in a massless graviton field .",
    "subsequently , we will compute the matter contributions to the graviton self - energy tensor resulting from massive scalar , pseudo - scalar , fermion and vector - boson particles in the loops .      the graviton self - energy transition @xmath206 , which we denote as @xmath207 , receives two renormalizations : ( i ) from the bare cosmological constant @xmath208 which induces a ct proportional to @xmath209 for the graviton mass in the effective action [ cf .  ] ; ( ii ) from the ricci scalar @xmath26 and the higher - dimensional operators @xmath210 and @xmath211 . the latter contributions  ( ii ) , which we denote as @xmath212 , are transverse in the minimal subtraction scheme ( @xmath213 ) of renormalization and they have therefore no effect on the graviton  mass .    taking into account the two contributions mentioned above , the renormalized graviton self - energy @xmath214",

    "<S> * abstract *    we revisit the calculation of matter quantum effects on the graviton self - energy on a flat minkowski background , with the aim to acquire a deeper understanding of the mechanism that renders the graviton massless . to this end , we derive a low - energy theorem which directly relates the radiative corrections of the cosmological constant to those of the graviton mass to all orders in perturbation theory . as an illustrative example , we consider an abelian higgs model with minimal coupling to gravity and show explicitly how a suitable renormalization of the cosmological constant leads to the vanishing of the graviton mass at the one - loop level . in the same abelian higgs model , we also calculate the matter quantum corrections to the newtonian potential and present analytical formulae in terms of modified bessel and struve functions of the particle masses in the loop . </S>",
    "<S> we  show that the correction to the newtonian potential exhibits an exponential fall - off dependence on the distance  @xmath0 , once the non - relativistic limit with respect to the non - zero loop mass is carefully considered . for massless scalars , fermions and gauge bosons in the loops , </S>",
