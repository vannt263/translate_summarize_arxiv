    "according to general relativity ( gr ) , the fate of any sufficiently massive star is to end up its lifetime forming a black hole , a spacetime region that contains a zero - volume singularity of infinite density cloaked by an event horizon .",
    "singularity and uniqueness theorems , together with the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite , tell us that black holes are described by solely three parameters : mass , charge and angular momentum , a result known as the no - hair theorem that yields the kerr - newman family @xcite . for any black hole , the event horizon acts as a sort of no - way - out layer that separates the physics outside the horizon , which is the one that we can directly explore and find it in excellent agreement with the gr predictions @xcite , from the physics of its interior , where much less is known .",
    "when quantum phenomena come into play , the mere existence of an event horizon induces the emission of thermal particles via hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "quantum effects may also affect the details of gravitational collapse , as recently studied in @xcite , and are likely to play a very important role when the spacetime curvature reaches the planck scale .",
    "in fact , it is generally accepted that classical black hole singularities should be removed by quantum gravitational effects . however , our current understanding of quantum gravity is not mature enough to provide a clear and detailed description of how this could occur .",
    "it seems thus justified to explore phenomenological approaches to this problem hoping to gain some new insights that help us to better understand how black hole structure could be modified by quantum gravity effects .    as the singularity theorems only state some precise physical conditions under which the appearance of singularities is unavoidable ,",
    "several approaches have been carried out to find conditions that avoid or ameliorate the formation of black hole singularities .",
    "a well known example is bardeen s black hole @xcite , in which _ exotic _",
    "matter sources get rid of the singularity while keeping the horizons and the asymptotically flat character .",
    "this singularity avoidance is realized through the formation of a central matter ( de sitter ) core , such that the corresponding spacetime is interpreted as the gravitational field of a nonlinear magnetic monopole and can be derived from a nonlinear electrodynamics model @xcite .",
    "that approach became a prototype for most developments on regular black holes within classical gr . in this sense",
    ", there has been much activity aimed at finding alternative matter sources for the interior region , such as introducing nonlinearities as in the case of nonlinear theories of electrodynamics @xcite , implementing a de sitter core that matches the exterior field in some  junction \" region ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , or using new ideas inspired by noncommutative geometry @xcite , in such a way that singularities are removed .",
    "also other regular magnetically charged solutions within gr have been found @xcite .",
    "a different approach comes from the idea that extensions of gr with high - curvature corrections could be able to capture some essential features useful or required to find an effective description of the quantum gravity dynamics .",
    "this point is supported by the study of quantum fields in curved spacetimes and by approaches to quantum gravity based on string theory @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "gravity theories containing higher - order curvature invariants naturally appear as modifications of gr in these quantum gravity approaches .",
    "such theories generically lead to higher - order partial derivative equations , which is a manifestation of the fact that new high - energy degrees of freedom are being taken into account .",
    "the resulting solutions are thus expected to depend on a larger number of parameters ( integration constants ) , which should provide more freedom and/or new mechanisms to avoid the singularities . however , nonsingular black holes of this kind are rather scarce ( see e.g. @xcite ) and usually require the addition of exotic sources of matter again .",
    "this suggests that the addition of new degrees of freedom in the problem is unable by itself to resolve the problem of singularities .",
    "moreover , these theories suffer from ghosts and other perturbative instabilities @xcite .",
    "these problems , however , can be avoided if the curvature invariants appear in appropriate combinations , because then the equations of motion may remain second - order like in gr . these are known as lovelock gravities @xcite ( see , for instance , @xcite for a pedagogical introduction ) . for example , the simplest extension of einstein gravity via higher - curvature terms in this context corresponds to gauss - bonnet gravity and picks up three new terms , @xmath0 , which supplement the einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "it should be noted that in @xmath1 dimensions these new terms are topological invariants not contributing to the equations of motion , which means that lovelock gravities only provide modified dynamics in the context of higher dimensions",
    ". exact static spherically symmetric solutions to gauss - bonnet theory in vacuum @xcite and with electrostatic fields @xcite are known , but they still contain singularities or are ill defined .",
    "an alternative strategy to obtain modified gravitational dynamics beyond gr is to assume that the metric and affine structures of the theory are independent @xcite . when the connection is not constrained",
    "_ a priori _ to be given by the christoffel symbols of the metric , one finds that even @xmath2 extensions yield second - order field equations , which contrasts with the usual ( metric ) formulation of those theories @xcite and the general belief that only lovelock gravities have second - order equations .",
    "this approach , known as palatini formalism , has been recently used to obtain a covariant action for the effective hamiltonian dynamics of loop quantum cosmology @xcite , an approach to quantum cosmology based on the nonperturbative quantization techniques of loop quantum gravity @xcite . in the palatini approach @xcite ,",
    "metric and connection are regarded as independent entities and the field equations are obtained by independent variation of the action with respect to both of them .",
    "though this does not affect the dynamics of gr @xcite , it does have important consequences for extensions of it @xcite .",
    "in general , one finds that in palatini theories the matter plays an active role in the construction of the independent connection , which ends up producing modified dynamics .",
    "when there is no matter , the field equations boil down to those of gr with an effective cosmological constant , which depends on the form of the particular lagrangian chosen .",
    "this property has made these theories very attractive for cosmological applications .",
    "the unusual role played by the matter in the construction of the geometry in palatini theories together with the second - order character of their field equations makes them specially interesting to explore the effects of new gravitational physics on the structure of black holes . in this sense , in ref.@xcite we considered palatini @xmath2 modifications of gr in interaction with modified matter sources , through nonlinear electrodynamics ( neds ) . in palatini @xmath2 theories ,",
    "the modified dynamics is due to a number of new terms on the right - hand side of the equations that depend on the trace @xmath3 of the energy - momentum tensor of the matter . unlike maxwell s electrodynamics , the stress - energy tensor of neds possesses , in general , a nonvanishing trace , which makes them specially suitable to excite the palatini modified dynamics in electrovacuum scenarios . in the particular case of",
    "born - infeld ned coupled to the gravity theory @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the planck curvature , we found that the degree of divergence of the kretschmann scalar near the singularity can be much weaker than in gr .    in this work",
    "we go beyond ref.@xcite and explore how black hole structure is affected by new physics at the planck scale by considering a palatini theory of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the ( symmetric ) ricci tensor , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants .",
    "terms of this kind have been considered in the metric approach in an attempt to find ghost and singularity free theories of gravity @xcite , and also in the study of black holes coupled to neds @xcite . in the palatini framework ,",
    "@xmath11 theories yield second - order field equations that exactly boil down to the usual einstein - de sitter equations in vacuum ( see details in @xcite and below ) , which guarantees the absence of ghosts and other dynamical instabilities .",
    "the presence of a ricci - squared term in the action is very important because it leads to modified dynamics even for traceless matter sources , such as radiation and the usual maxwell electromagnetic field , which contrasts with @xmath2 theories . as a result",
    ", this quadratic @xmath11 model provides the simplest extension beyond gr of the usual ( nonrotating ) reissner - nordstrm black hole . the quadratic @xmath11 palatini model proposed here",
    "has already been studied in cosmological scenarios , where it was found that the big bang singularity is replaced by a cosmic bounce in isotropic and anisotropic ( bianchi i ) universes filled with standard sources of matter and radiation @xcite .    in refs.@xcite we reported on several key aspects of nonsingular black hole solutions found in this model .",
    "in this paper we shall go further on this subject extending those results and providing a comprehensive account of all the derivations and technical details .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : ii ]",
    "we recall some basic aspects of palatini @xmath11 theories and write the associated field equations .",
    "the particular actions for matter ( maxwell ) and gravity sectors of our theory are introduced in section [ section : iii ] , where we construct all the relevant geometric objects . in section [ section : iv ]",
    "we comment on the choice of ansatz for the line element , and proceed to solve the metric field equations .",
    "section [ section : v ] is devoted to the analysis of the interior region and to the characterization of the event horizons .",
    "in particular we construct the penrose diagrams and their maximal analytical extensions associated to the different black holes and _ naked cores _ found .",
    "the physical aspects of these solutions , including singular and nonsingular black holes , and microscopic _ naked cores _ , are discussed in section [ section : vi ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ section : vii ] with a summary and some future perspectives .",
    "we define palatini @xmath11 theories as follows @xmath12=\\frac{1}{2\\kappa^2}\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g}f(r , q ) + s_m[g,\\psi_m],\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 $ ] represents the matter action , @xmath15 is the space - time metric , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19    variation of ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to metric and connection leads to the following equations @xcite @xmath20&=&0   \\",

    ", one finds that @xmath26 . in our theory ( [ eq :",
    "action ] ) , the condition @xmath23}=0 $ ] is equivalent to assuming that @xmath27 can be solved as the levi - civita connection of an auxiliary metric @xmath28 , which leads to @xmath29 .",
    "the explicit relation between @xmath28 and @xmath30 follows from the field equations and will be discussed later .",
    "a reason to set @xmath23}=0 $ ] is that then the field equations of ( [ eq : action ] ) in vacuum boil down exactly to those of gr ( with possibly a cosmological constant , depending on the function @xmath11 chosen ) .",
    "this guarantees that there are no new propagating degrees of freedom and , therefore , the resulting theory is not affected by ghosts or other dynamical instabilities . in regions containing sources ,",
    "the equations of ( [ eq : action ] ) differ from those of gr due to the presence of new matter / energy - dependent terms induced by the mismatch between @xmath28 and @xmath30 , which leads to modified gravitational dynamics without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom or higher - order derivatives of the metric .",
    "if the condition @xmath23}=0 $ ] is relaxed , then @xmath31 must also have a purely vectorial component , @xmath32 , which adds new dynamical degrees of freedom to the theory . in that case , the dynamics of ( [ eq : action ] ) differs from that of gr even in the absence of matter / energy sources ( see @xcite for related results in this direction ) .",
    "we now focus on working out a solution for ( [ eq : con - varx ] ) . at first sight ,",
    "since @xmath33 and @xmath8 are functions of the connection and its first derivatives , ( [ eq : con - varx ] ) can be seen as a nonlinear , second - order partial differential equation for the unknown connection .",
    "however , there exist algebraic relations between @xmath33 , @xmath8 and the energy - momentum tensor of the matter that make the problem easier to handle .",
    "to proceed , we first define the matrix @xmath34 , whose components are @xmath35 , which allows us to express ( [ eq : met - varx ] ) as @xmath36 in matrix notation , this equation reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the matrix representation of @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath33 and @xmath40 are the trace of @xmath34 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : met - varrq2 ] ) implies that @xmath34 can be expressed as a function of the components of the energy - momentum tensor , i.e. , @xmath42 . assuming that for a given @xmath11 theory such a solution exists , eq.([eq : con - varx ] )",
    "can now be seen as an algebraic equation for the connection in which , besides the metric @xmath30 , there is an explicit dependence on the energy - momentum tensor of the matter . to solve it",
    ", we look for a metric @xmath43 such that ( [ eq : con - varx ] ) becomes @xmath44=0 $ ] .",
    "this guarantees that the independent connection can be expressed as the levi - civita connection of @xmath43 . using matrix notation",
    ", we have @xmath45 where we have defined @xmath46 . computing the determinant of this expression , we find @xmath47 . with this result , we have @xmath48 this shows that the connection of @xmath11 theories can be explicitly solved in terms of the physical metric @xmath30 and the matter sources .    with the above results ,",
    "the metric field equations can be rewritten in a more compact and transparent form . expressing ( [ eq : met - varrq2 ] ) as @xmath49 and using ( [ eq : h - g ] ) , we can rewrite @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "this allows to express ( [ eq : met - varrq3 ] ) as @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the schwarzschild black hole is the most general spherically symmetric , nonrotating vacuum solution of gr and also of ( [ eq : met - varx ] ) .",
    "however , that solution assumes that all the matter is concentrated on a point of infinite density , which is not consistent with the dynamics of ( [ eq : met - varx ] ) .",
    "in fact , if one considers the collapsing object as described by a perfect fluid that behaves as radiation during the last stages of the collapse , explicit computation of the scalar @xmath54 shows that the energy density @xmath55 is bounded from above by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 g/@xmath58 is planck s density @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should study the complicated process of collapse of a spherical nonrotating object to determine how the schwarzschild metric is modified in our theory . for this reason we study instead vacuum space - times with an electric field , which possess a nonzero stress - energy tensor able to excite the palatini dynamics even in static settings .",
    "the resulting solutions should therefore be seen as planck - scale modifications of the usual reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "let us thus consider as the matter source in action ( [ eq : action ] ) the maxwell lagrangian    @xmath59 = -\\frac{1}{2\\kappa^2}\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g}f_{\\alpha\\beta}f^{\\alpha\\beta}\\ ] ]    whose associated stress - energy tensor is written as    @xmath60 \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the field strength tensor of the vector potential @xmath62 .",
    "for a purely electrostatic configuration and taking a spherically symmetry line element of the form @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , one finds that the only nonvanishing component is @xmath65 .",
    "it is then easy to see that the ( sourceless ) field equations @xmath66 lead to @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an integration constant that represents the charge generating the electric field . with this result ,",
    "the product @xmath69 in ( [ eq : em ] ) becomes @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 represent the @xmath73 identity and zero matrices , respectively . using this",
    ", we find that @xmath74    in order to write the field equations in the form ( [ eq : met - varrq4 ] ) , we first need to find the explicit form of @xmath34 for this matter source , which will allow us to construct @xmath75 and compute its determinant .",
    "to do this , we use ( [ eq : tmn - em ] ) and write ( [ eq : met - varrq2 ] ) as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and we have defined @xmath78 .",
    "it is easy to see that there are @xmath79 square roots that satisfy this equation , namely , @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",

    "since for maxwell theory @xmath95 , it follows that the @xmath96 part of the @xmath11 theory does not play a very relevant role in the dynamics .",
    "we will just assume that the @xmath96 part is close to gr , @xmath97 , and that @xmath98 for simplicity ( and for consistency with the choice @xmath84 above ) .",
    "this is true , in particular , for the model @xmath99 whose cosmological dynamics has been carefully studied in the literature @xcite and that we set as the model to be discussed from now on . for this model",

    "this is so because if physically allowed transitions occur between nonsingular configurations only , then the resulting spectrum must be discrete .",
    "our analysis also puts forward the existence of a new kind of nonsingular objects which are not hidden by an external horizon . these _ naked cores _ exist for values of the charge comprised within the interval @xmath374 .",
    "an important lesson that follows from our analysis is that the boundedness of the energy density does not necessarily imply that the spacetime is nonsingular . in order to find nonsingular solutions ,",
    "it is necessary that charge and mass satisfy a particular relation . in this sense",
    ", it seems fair to say that the mass spectrum and sizes of the nonsingular objects described here need not be in correspondence with actual physical particles . from the discussion of section [ section : iv ] on the relation between @xmath375 and @xmath129",
    ", it follows that including new scales in the problem ( such as the masses and different gauge charges of the particles making up the system ) should have an impact on the resulting value of @xmath324 , defined as the value of @xmath122 at which the energy density reaches its maximum .",
    "the analogous of the regularity condition @xmath218 could also set more complicated constraints between the total mass and total charges of the system , thus providing a richer structure to the set of nonsingular solutions .",
    "these aspects , together with the process of formation and the stability under perturbations of the nonsingular solutions ( with and without external horizon ) studied here is currently underway .",

    "<S> we study static , spherically symmetric solutions with an electric field in an extension of general relativity ( gr ) containing a ricci - squared term and formulated in the palatini formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all the solutions present a central core whose area is proportional to the planck area times the number of charges . </S>",
    "<S> far from the core , curvature invariants quickly tend to those of the usual reissner - nordstrm solution , though the structure of horizons may be different . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , besides the structures found in the reissner - nordstrm solution of gr , we find black hole solutions with just one nondegenerate horizon ( schwarzschild - like ) , and nonsingular black holes and naked cores . </S>",
    "<S> the charge - to - mass ratio of the nonsingular solutions implies that the core matter density is independent of the specific amounts of charge and mass and of order the planck density . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the physical implications of these results for astrophysical and microscopic black holes , construct the penrose diagrams of some illustrative cases , and show that the maximal analytical extension of the nonsingular solutions implies a bounce of the radial coordinate . </S>"
