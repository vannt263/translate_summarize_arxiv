    "in order to obtain a quantum mechanical model for a particular physical system such as a particle moving in space , it is necessary to supplement the abstract quantum formalism with various rules , to which we shall refer collectively as _ correspondence rules _ , which explicitly determine the form of the operators that represent particular measurements performed on the system , or that represent particular symmetry transformations  ( such as displacement or rotation ) of the frame of reference in which the system is being observed .",
    "these correspondence rules can be usefully classified as follows :    * _ operator rules . _",
    "rules for writing down operators representing measurements of observables that , in the framework of classical physics , are known functions of other , elementary , observables whose operators are given  , then  @xmath0 ; ( ii )  rule  2  ( sum rule ) :  if  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 , then  @xmath3  ( and similarly for more than two observables ) , and ( iii )  rule  3  ( product rule ) :  if  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 , where  @xmath4=0 $ ] , then  @xmath5  ( and similarly for more than two observables ) . a more general rule that is often employed",
    "is :  ( iv )  rule  3@xmath6  ( hermitization rule ) :  if  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 , then  @xmath7 . ] .",
    "for example , such rules are needed to be able to write down the operator that represents a measurement of  @xmath8 , given the classical relation  @xmath9 , in terms of the operators  @xmath10 and  @xmath11 which represent measurements of  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 , respectively . * _ measurement commutation relations .",
    "_ commutation relations between operators that represent measurements of fundamental observables such as position , momentum , and components of angular momentum .",
    "the commutation relations  @xmath14=i\\hbar$ ] and  @xmath15=i\\hbar{\\textsf{l}}_z$ ] , are the obvious examples , while dirac s poisson bracket rule ,  @xmath4 = i\\hbar \\widehat{\\{a , b\\}}$ ] , is the more general rule , where  @xmath16 is the classical poisson bracket for observables  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 , and  @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and  @xmath21 are the respective operators . *",
    "_ measurement  transformation commutation relations .",
    "_ the commutation relations between measurement operators and transformation operators .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath12-displacement operator ,  @xmath22 , one has , for example ,  @xmath23=i$ ] and  @xmath24=0 $ ] . * _ transformation operators .",
    "_ explicit forms of the operators that represent symmetry transformations of a frame of reference , such as the @xmath12-displacement operator  @xmath25 .",
    "the physical origin of many of the above - mentioned rules is obscure .",
    "for example , although one can give simple physical arguments   for the operator rule which states that , if a measurement of  @xmath17 is represented by operator  @xmath20 , then a measurement of the function  @xmath26 is represented by operator  @xmath27 , the generalization of such arguments to measurements of functions of two or more observables encounters severe difficulties due to the possible non - commutativity of the operators that represent these observables . as a result of such difficulties ,",
    "operator rules tend to be heuristic and tend to lead to inconsistencies when applied to particular examples  . ]",
    ". similarly , the commutation relationship  @xmath14=i\\hbar$ ] is typically obtained from schroedinger s equation or from dirac s poisson bracket rule , both of whose derivations involve abstract assumptions whose physical origin is obscure .",
    "the question of what additional physical ideas are needed to obtain the correspondence rules described above _ given _ the abstract quantum formalism has received relatively little recent attention .",
    "recent work on the elucidation of the physical origin of the quantum formalism  ( see paper  i for references",
    "@xcite ) tends to neglect the question of the physical origin of the correspondence rules or is concerned with the derivation of the schroedinger equation directly from physical ideas without taking the abstract quantum formalism as a given  @xcite .",
    "operator rules have been discussed in a few publications , for example in  @xcite , but a derivation of the operator rules on the basis of a physical principle , taking the abstract formalism as a given , has not been successfully completed .",
    "the most recent systematic attempt to derive the commonly employed measurement and measurement  transformation commutation relations in such a manner is found in  @xcite  ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in  @xcite , using the commutation relationships for the operators that represent the galilean group of transformations , and establishing the relation between these transformation operators and particular measurement operators , commutation relations for these measurement operators are obtained .",
    "however , this approach implicitly makes use of operator rules , and relies upon auxiliary assumptions  ( such as the assumption that certain measurement operators are unchanged by the action of particular symmetry operators ) whose physical origin is unclear .    in this paper , we show that , starting from the abstract quantum formalism , it is possible to derive all the above - mentioned correspondence rules in a systematic manner from a single correspondence principle .",
    "the principle , called the average - value correspondence principle  ( avcp ) , rests on the simple , intuitive notion that the quantum and classical models of the same physical system  ( such as a particle moving in a potential ) should agree in their predictions if one compares the expected values of the quantum measurements with the values obtained from the corresponding classical measurements , a connection which is known , via ehrenfest s theorem , to hold approximately between the classical and quantum models of a particle  @xcite .",
    "the principle expresses the classical - quantum correspondence in the following form :  in a classical experiment , if a measurement of observable  @xmath17 on a physical system can be implemented by an arrangement where measurements of observables  @xmath28 are performed on the system  ( possibly performed at a different time to the measurement of  @xmath17 ) , such that the value obtained from measurement of  @xmath17 can be calculated as a function ,  @xmath29 , of the values obtained from the measurements of  @xmath28 , then we can construct a corresponding quantum experiment , where quantum measurements  @xmath30 , corresponding to classical measurements of  @xmath31 , are performed on copies of the same physical system , such that the same functional relation holds _ on average _ between the values obtained from the quantum measurements , where the average is taken over infinitely many trials of the quantum experiment .",
    "this connection holds only if  @xmath29 satisfies a particular condition .",
    "the particular form of the quantum experiment is stipulated by the avcp , and consists in specifying whether , for each pair of quantum measurements , the measurements in the pair are performed on the same or different copies of the system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : avcp ] by formulating the  avcp . in sec .",
    "[ sec : deduction ] , the avcp is used to obtain several _ generalized operator rules _ which connect the average values of operators at different times , from which the commonly used operator rules of quantum theory follow as a special case . using the avcp and the temporal evolution postulate  ( from paper  i )",
    ", we then derive the explicit form of the temporal evolution operator , thereby completing the derivation of the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism begun in paper  i.    next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : commutation - relations ] , taking the infinite - dimensional form of the abstract quantum formalism as a given , we use the avcp to derive many of the commonly employed correspondence rules of quantum theory , namely  ( a ) the commutation relations  @xmath14=i\\hbar$ ] and  @xmath32=i\\hbar{\\textsf{l}}_z$ ] , and dirac s poisson bracket rule , ( b )  the explicit form of the operators for displacements and rotations , and ( c )  the commutation relations between momentum and displacement operators , and between angular momentum and rotation operators .",
    "we note that the treatment of the correspondence rules is illustrative rather than exhaustive , so that only the most commonly encountered measurement and transformation operators which are needed to formulate non - relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics have been discussed .",
    "many other correspondence rules  ( such as the operators that represent galilei transformations , temporal displacement , and discrete transformations such as spatial inversion ) can be obtained by arguments which closely follow those presented .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the results obtained .",
    "suppose that , as described in paper  i , a quantum model  @xmath33 , of dimension  @xmath34 , has been constructed to describe an abstract experimental set - up consisting of a source of identical systems , a measurement set  @xmath35 , and an interaction set  @xmath36 .",
    "the measurements in  @xmath35 , and the degenerate forms of measurements in  @xmath35   is defined operationally in paper  i. such a measurement has  @xmath37 possible results , and can be represented as an @xmath34-dimensional degenerate hermitian operator  ( with  @xmath38 distinct eigenvalues ) .",
    "] , are represented by @xmath34-dimensional hermitian operators  ( possibly with degenerate eigenvalues ) , and shall be called _ quantum _ measurements .",
    "suppose that quantum measurement  @xmath39 , with operator  @xmath20 , represents a measurement that is classically described as a measurement of some observable  @xmath17  ( which we shall henceforth abbreviate to  `` quantum measurement  @xmath39  ( or operator  @xmath20 ) represents a ( classical )  measurement of  @xmath17 '' ) .",
    "suppose that we wish to determine whether there is a quantum measurement that represents a measurement of , say ,  @xmath40 , and , if so , to determine the operator which can be said to represent this measurement .",
    "classically , one can imagine that a measurement of  @xmath40 is implemented by an experimental arrangement where a measurement of  @xmath17 is performed and the value obtained is then squared .",
    "if this arrangement is described in the quantum model , it follows that , if the input state is an element ,  @xmath41 , of an orthonormal set of eigenvectors of  @xmath20 , the output state of the process is  @xmath41 and the output of the process is  @xmath42 , where  @xmath43  ( @xmath44 ) . according to this line of reasoning ,",
    "it follows at once that the operator  @xmath45 therefore represents a measurement of  @xmath40 .",
    "however , this simple argument , given by dirac  @xcite , does not readily generalize .",
    "for example , suppose that quantum measurements  @xmath39 and  @xmath46 , with operators  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 , represent measurements of  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "suppose that we wish to determine the operator  ( if any exists ) that represents a measurement of  @xmath47 .",
    "classically , one imagines that such a measurement is implemented by making measurements of  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 simultaneously on a system , and adding the values obtained .",
    "however , if  @xmath4 \\ne 0 $ ] , this arrangement can not be described in the quantum framework since , in this framework , the measurements can not be performed at the same time on a single system .",
    "if one , then , instead considers an arrangement where , for instance , a measurement of  @xmath17 is followed immediately by a measurement of  @xmath18 , then , if the arrangement is described in the quantum framework , one can not find  @xmath34 input states which emerge as output states since the non - commutativity of  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 implies that  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 share fewer than  @xmath34 eigenstates in common , making it impossible to construct a simple parallel to dirac s argument .    now , the conventional operator rules of quantum theory assert that a measurement of  @xmath47 is represented by the operator  @xmath48 .",
    "although this seems entirely reasonable on a formal , symbolic level , it is not clear in what physical sense  @xmath48 can be said to ` represent ' the measurement . to see this , note that , whereas the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of  @xmath20 directly reflect the output states and the values obtained when measurement  @xmath39 is performed on the system , the eigenvectors of  @xmath48 do not , in general , coincide with the eigenvectors of either  @xmath20 or  @xmath21 , and the eigenvalues of  @xmath48 do not , in general , coincide with the outputs of any plausible arrangement  ( described in the quantum model ) that classically implements a measurement of  @xmath47 which involves performing measurements of  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 and combining the values obtained .",
    "for example , a classical measurement of  @xmath49 is implemented by an arrangement where measurements of  @xmath50 and  @xmath51 are performed immediately after one another , and their values added .",
    "when modeled in the quantum framework , the possible outputs of this arrangement , in the case where the measurements are performed on a spin-1/2 particle , are  @xmath52 , whereas a quantum measurement represented by operator  @xmath53 has possible values  @xmath54 .",
    "the above observations illustrate the difficulty of obtaining a physical understanding of the operator rules of quantum theory even in simple cases of interest .",
    "below , we shall formulate a physical principle which gives a clear physical meaning to the sense in which an operator can be said to represent a classical measurement , and , in the majority of cases of interest , uniquely determines the operator which represents such a measurement .",
    "consider again a measurement of  @xmath40 , where  @xmath17 is some observable .",
    "classically , one can imagine a measurement of  @xmath40 being implemented using one of three different arrangements  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mments - of - a - squared ] ) : ( i )  make a measurement of  @xmath17 on one copy of the system , and square the value obtained ; ( ii )  make two immediately successive measurements of  @xmath17 on one copy of the system , and multiply the two values obtained ; or  ( iii )  make two simultaneous measurements of  @xmath17 on two separate copies of the system prepared in the same state , and multiply the two values obtained .",
    "although the first of these arrangements is the one we have considered above , all three arrangements yield the same output when modeled classically , and so can be regarded as equally valid implementations of a measurement of  @xmath40 in the classical framework .",
    "three arrangement that classically implement a measurement of  @xmath40 . in  ( i ) , a measurement of  @xmath17 is made on one copy of the system , and the value obtained is squared to give the output ; in ( ii ) , two immediately successive measurements of  @xmath17 are made on one copy of the system , and the output is obtained by multiplying the two values obtained ; and ( iii )  two simultaneous measurements of  @xmath17 are made on two separate copies of the system prepared in the same state , and the output is obtained by multiplying the two values obtained . in a classical model of these arrangements , each arrangement yields the same output .",
    "however , in the quantum model of these arrangements , the expected output of  ( i ) and  ( ii ) is  @xmath55 whereas the expected output of  ( iii ) is  @xmath56.,width=312 ]    now , perhaps surprisingly , when described using the quantum model , these arrangements do not , in general , yield the same expected outputs . consider a quantum theoretic description of the first arrangement where quantum measurement  @xmath39 represents a measurement of  @xmath17 . in each run of the experiment ,",
    "one copy of the system is prepared in some given state .",
    "let the probability that a measurement  @xmath39 yields result  @xmath57  ( @xmath58 ) , with value  @xmath59 , be denoted  @xmath60 .",
    "then , the expected output is given by @xmath61 one finds that arrangement  ( ii ) yields the same expected output .",
    "however , in arrangement  ( iii ) , where , in each run of the experiment , two copies of the system are prepared in the same state , one obtains @xmath62 with  @xmath60 and  @xmath63 denoting respectively the probabilities that measurements  @xmath39 on the first and second copy yield result  @xmath57 and  @xmath64  ( @xmath65 ) .    in this example , the differences between the arrangements as viewed in the quantum model arise due to the fact that , in the quantum framework , an immediate repetition of a measurement on the same copy of a system is different from performing a second simultaneous measurement on a separate , identically - prepared , copy of the system .    in the case of a measurement of  @xmath47 , where measurements of  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 are assumed to occur at the same time ,",
    "one needs to take into account the additional fact that , in the quantum framework , the order in which two measurements is performed is of possible importance .",
    "accordingly , one can imagine implementing a measurement of  @xmath47 using one of at least three arrangements  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mments - of - a - plus - b ] ) : ( i )  make a measurement of  @xmath17 , and then a measurement of  @xmath18 , on one copy of the system , and add the values obtained ; ( ii ) make a measurement of  @xmath18 , and then a measurement of  @xmath17 , on one copy of the system , and add the values obtained ; ( iii )  make a measurement of  @xmath17 on one copy of the system and , simultaneously , a measurement of  @xmath18 on a second copy of the system prepared in the same state as the first copy , and add the values obtained . once again , in a classical model of these arrangements , the outputs agree .",
    "however , if one calculates the expected outputs in the quantum model , one finds that , if  @xmath4\\ne 0 $ ] , all three will , in general , disagree with one another .",
    "three implementations of the measurement classically described as `` a measurement of  @xmath47 '' .",
    "in  ( i ) , a measurement of  @xmath17 , and then a measurement of  @xmath18 , is made on one copy of the system , and the values obtained are then added to give the output ; in ( ii ) , a measurement of  @xmath18 , and then a measurement of  @xmath17 , is made on one copy of the system , and the values obtained are then added to give the output ; and ( iii )  simultaneous measurements of  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 are made on two separate copies of the system prepared in the same state , and the output is obtained by adding the two values obtained . in a classical model of these arrangements , each arrangement yields the same output .",
    "however , in the quantum model of this situation , the three arrangements do not , in general , yield the same expected outputs.,width=312 ]    as these examples illustrate , different arrangements that implement the same classical measurement do not , in general , give the same expected output when described in the quantum framework .      the existence of different arrangements that implement the same classical measurement immediately raises two questions .",
    "first , are these arrangements , in some sense , equally valid in the quantum framework , or it is possible to find some reasonable physical basis upon which to select particular arrangements and regard these as more fundamental than the others ?",
    "second , is it possible to find operators that represent the selected arrangements , and , if so , do all the selected arrangements that implement a given measurement have the same operator representation ?    to answer these questions , we begin by observing that , although the above arrangements are all regarded as _",
    "bone fide _ implementations of measurements in the classical model , a measurement is only describable as such in the quantum model , and so can be called a quantum measurement , if it can be represented by a hermitian operator which represents a single measurement performed upon one copy of the system at a particular time .",
    "so , for example , although arrangement  ( iii ) of a measurement of  @xmath40 can be modeled in the quantum framework , it can not be described as a quantum measurement since it involves two separate measurements .",
    "in contrast , arrangement  ( i ) can be described as a quantum measurement since it only involves a single measurement on one copy of the system .",
    "however , although an arrangement involving more than one measurement can not itself be regarded as a quantum measurement when modeled in the quantum framework , we can reasonably ask whether it is possible to find a quantum measurement ,  @xmath66 , with operator  @xmath67 , which , in some sense to be determined , can nonetheless be said to _ represent _ the arrangement .    at the outset",
    ", we note that it makes no sense to require that measurement  @xmath66 always yield a value that coincides with the output of a given arrangement since measurement results are only probabilistically determined in the quantum framework .",
    "however , we _ can _ impose the simple condition that , over an infinite number of runs , the average value obtained from measurement  @xmath66 should coincide with the average output obtained from the arrangement for any initial state of the system .",
    "for example , in the case of an arrangement that implements a measurement of  @xmath40 , quantum measurement  @xmath68 which , by hypothesis , represents the arrangement , must be such that , for all states of the system ,  @xmath69 is equal to the expected output obtained from the arrangement . in the case of arrangements  ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) described above , using eq .",
    ", we accordingly obtain the condition that the relation @xmath70 must hold for all states ,  @xmath71 , of the system . from this condition , we can conclude that @xmath72 in the case of arrangement  ( iii ) , using eq .",
    ", we obtain the condition that the relation @xmath73 must hold for all  @xmath71 . by diagonalizing  @xmath20",
    ", one can readily show that this condition implies that  @xmath20 is a multiple of the identity , which represents a trivial measurement that yields the same result irrespective of the state of the system .",
    "therefore , arrangement  ( iii ) does not satisfy the above average - value condition in the case of any non - trivial measurement of  @xmath17 , and can therefore be reasonably eliminated .",
    "hence , in this case , the average - value condition is sufficiently strong so as to be able to pick out arrangements  ( i ) and  ( ii ) , and , since the average - value condition also implies that these arrangements are both represented by the operator ,  @xmath74 , one can unambiguously conclude that a measurement of  @xmath40 is represented by the operator  @xmath74 .    proceeding in a similar way , restricting ourselves for the time being to measurements  @xmath39 and  @xmath46 that are not subsystem measurements",
    ", one finds that , in the case of a measurement of  @xmath75 , only arrangement  ( iii ) is possible if  @xmath4\\ne 0 $ ] , which then yields the operator @xmath76 if  @xmath4= 0 $ ] , then all three arrangements are possible , and all yield the same operator ,  @xmath67 , as above .    finally , in the case of a measurement of  @xmath77 , with  @xmath78=0 $ ] , one finds that the arrangement must be the one where measurements  @xmath79 and  @xmath80 are performed on the same copy of the system , in which case the operator  @xmath81 is obtained .",
    "hence , we see that the average - value condition is sufficient to yield a unique operator representation for the measurements considered above . based on the above considerations , we can tentatively formulate the following general rule :  in the case of a measurement which is implemented by an arrangement that contains two elementary measurements  ( not subsystem measurements ) represented by commuting operators , it is possible to find a quantum measurement that represents the arrangement if the two elementary measurements are performed on the same copy of the system ; but , when the operators do not commute , the elementary measurements must be performed on different copies of the system .",
    "we now consider implementations of a measurement of  @xmath77 in the case when  @xmath4\\ne 0 $ ] .",
    "the general rule just given suggests that we should consider the arrangement where the measurements of  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 are performed on different copies of the system . when described in the quantum framework , this arrangement has the expected output @xmath82 with  @xmath60 and  @xmath63 denoting respectively the probabilities that the measurement  @xmath39 on the first copy and the measurement  @xmath46 on the second copy yield result  @xmath57 and  @xmath64  ( @xmath83 ) , and  @xmath84 respectively denoting the values of the @xmath57th and @xmath64th results of measurements  @xmath39 and  @xmath46 . imposing the above average - value condition ,",
    "the operator  @xmath67 that represents this implementation must satisfy the condition @xmath85 for all  @xmath71 .",
    "however , for non - commuting  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 , one finds that  @xmath67 can not be found such that this relation is satisfied for all  @xmath71 .",
    "we note , however , that with @xmath86 equation   holds for the eigenstates of  @xmath20 and the eigenstates of  @xmath21 , which suggests that we may be able to weaken the average - value condition in this case so that we only require that eq",
    ".   holds for these eigenstates .",
    "however , as we shall illustrate later  ( sec .",
    "[ sec : inconsistencies ] ) , the application of eq .   can lead to inconsistencies .",
    "consequently , we conclude that , from the point of view of the average - value condition , it is not possible to find an operator that represents a measurement of  @xmath77 when the operators  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 do not commute . more generally , we find that , when  @xmath4\\ne 0 $ ] , it is necessary to exclude measurements of  @xmath87 , with  @xmath29 analytic  ( so that  @xmath29 has a well - defined polynomial expansion in  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 ) , where the polynomial expansion of  @xmath29 contains product terms .    finally , in the case of a classical measurement which is implemented by an arrangement which contains two measurements that are performed on different subsystems of a composite system , one finds that the arrangement can be represented by a quantum measurement irrespective of whether the two measurements are performed on the same or on different copies of the system , and that the different possible arrangements are represented by the same operator .      in the examples",
    "above , we have considered arrangements that implement a classical measurement in which the measurement and the measurements in the arrangement are performed at the same time , and in the same frame of reference . however , as the following examples illustrate , these are unnecessary restrictions .",
    "first , classically , for a non - relativistic particle of mass  @xmath88 , one can implement a measurement of  @xmath12 performed at time  @xmath89 by an arrangement where measurements of  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 are performed at time  @xmath90 , and the function  @xmath91 is then computed .",
    "second , one can implement a measurement of  @xmath92 on a particle in the reference frame  @xmath93 that is displaced along the @xmath12-axis relative to frame  @xmath94 by performing a measurement of  @xmath12 in frame  @xmath94 , and computing the appropriate function  @xmath95 that relates  @xmath12 and  @xmath92 .",
    "the above considerations regarding the implementation of a classical measurement are applicable without change to the case where the measurement and the measurements in the arrangement by which it is implemented are performed at different times or in different frames of reference .",
    "below , we shall accordingly generalize our notion of the implementation of a classical measurement .",
    "we shall now state a general principle which incorporates the observations made above concerning the average - value condition .",
    "an illustrative example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : avcp - example ] .",
    "* * average - value correspondence principle * consider a classical idealized experiment in which a system  ( possibly a composite system ) is prepared in some state at time  @xmath96 , and is allowed to evolve in a given background .",

    "the derivation provides several physical insights into the correspondence rules .",
    "the first insight is that the classical description of a measurement  ( such as ` a measurement of  @xmath438 ' ) can be implemented by more than one arrangement , and that , when modeled in the quantum framework , these arrangements are , in general , not equivalent .",
    "second , it is possible to impose a simple average - value condition that must be satisfied by an operator that can be said to represent an arrangement that implements a classical measurement .",
    "this condition implies that many arrangements can not be represented by an operator , and can therefore be eliminated from consideration .",
    "that is , one finds that there are arrangements which , although acceptable representations of a measurement in the classical framework , can not be represented by operators in the quantum framework without violating a very mild average - value condition .",
    "third , in the case of an arrangement that satisfies the average - value condition , the operator that represents the arrangement is uniquely determined by the average - value condition provided that the function ,  @xmath29 , that describes the arrangement , is simple .",
    "one also finds that those arrangements that satisfy the average - value condition are represented by the same operator , so that it is possible to represent a measurement of  @xmath29 by a unique operator .",
    "if  @xmath29 is not simple , then it does not appear to be possible to apply the average - value condition , even in a weakened form , without inconsistencies arising .",
    "fourth , we have found that the avcp is incompatible with the assumption that every classical measurement on a system is represented by a quantum measurement in the quantum model of the system .",
    "for example , the avcp implies that a measurement of  @xmath77 does not have an operator representation if  @xmath78\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "the fifth insight rests on the fact that , rather surprisingly , the avcp enables correspondence rules of each of the four types described in the introduction  ( operator rules , measurement commutation relations , measurement  transformation commutation relations , and transformation operators ) to be obtained in a uniform manner .",
    "consequently , one can see that the difference between these types of rules depends simply upon whether the classical relations that one is taking over into the quantum framework are relations between measurements performed at the same time  ( leading to the operator rules ) , at different times  ( leading to measurement commutation relations ) , or in different frames of reference  ( leading to measurement  transformation commutation relations and to the explicit forms of transformation operators ) . in short , from the perspective provided by the derivation , the commutation relation  @xmath233 = i\\hbar$ ] is no more mysterious in its origin than the operator relation  @xmath439 .",
    "sixth , the derivation provides a clearer physical foundation to many particular correspondence rules that are commonly used in quantum theory .",
    "for example , the commutation relation  @xmath32=i\\hbar { \\textsf{l}}_z$ ] is ordinarily derived in the infinite - dimensional quantum formalism for a particle  ( by transposing the classical relation  @xmath440 , and cyclic permutations thereof , into the quantum framework using the operator rules ) , and is then assumed , without further justification , to also hold in the finite - dimensional case . here , we have obtained this commutation relation directly for finite- and infinite - dimensional quantum systems , and have done so in a manner that makes clear its connection with the properties of rotations .",
    "similarly , a restricted form of dirac s poisson bracket rule has been derived in a systematic manner using the avcp without making use of abstract analogies .",
    "finally , we remark that , although the general notion of average - value correspondence is already familiar in elementary quantum mechanics through ehrenfest s theorem , the possibility that such a correspondence might serve as the basis for a constructive principle that allows the correspondence rules of quantum theory to be determined by appropriately - chosen classical relations does not appear to have been widely explored  .",
    "it has been shown here that it is possible to formulate the notion of average - value correspondence in the form of an exact physical principle which , roughly speaking , allows the logic of ehrenfest s argument to be reversed , enabling the often physically obscure correspondence rules of quantum theory to be derived in a systematic manner from familiar relations known to hold in classical physics .",
    "i am indebted to steve gull and mike payne for their support , and to tetsuo amaya and matthew donald for discussions and invaluable comments .",
    "i would like to thank the cavendish laboratory ; trinity college , cambridge ; wolfson college , cambridge ; and perimeter institute for institutional and financial support .",
    "research at perimeter institute is supported in part by the government of canada through nserc and by the province of ontario through medt ."
