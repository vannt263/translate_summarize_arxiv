    "conformal gravity has been suggested as an alternative gravity theory which gives a partial resolution of the problem of missing matter in galaxies @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is a simpler theory of gravity as the choice for the action , that is minimal in the number of derivatives , is unique and it has a higher degree of symmetry , invariance under local conformal transformations in addition to general covariance .",
    "however , since it is a higher , fourth order theory of gravity , the integration of the equations of motion gives rise to two additional integration constants in comparison to the usual second order einstein theory .",
    "indeed , the solution analogous to the schwarzschild solution corresponds to , in the weak field limit , the usual newtonian potential augmented with a linear potential and a cosmological solution@xcite . the coefficient of the linear potential can be adjusted to become relevant at galactic scales .",
    "it is intriguing that a simpler theory of gravitation can gi !",
    "ve rise to a reasonable , alternative explanation for the question of missing matter .",
    "there is another avenue of interest for the conformally invariant theory of gravitation .",
    "evidently , conformal invariance implies that there is no prescribed scale in the field theory , it has dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "as it is fourth order in derivatives , the propagator behaves as @xmath2 which helps with the perturbative ultraviolet renormalisability @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been recently shown that conformal gravity is renormalisable to the 1 loop@xcite .",
    "it has been observed that theories with more symmetries are usually less divergent and more tractable as quantum field theories , there is some hope that conformal gravity might provide for a consistent theory of quantum gravity .    in this paper",
    "we study a particular theory of conformally invariant matter and gravitation .",
    "even though it is a specific model we believe the results to be quite generic within this context .",
    "we find that the theory contains spontaneous breaking of the conformal invariance .",
    "conformally coupled matter / gravity and also spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance has been considered by demir , odintsov and mannheim @xcite .",
    "mannheim s work is closest in spirit to our paper .",
    "he considers the conformally coupled scalar / gravitational field equations .",
    "he finds for a negative scalar field self - coupling , a mass scale is generated in the theory and the metric corresponds to de - sitter space - time .",
    "we find that anti - de - sitter space - time arises naturally as the vacuum solution of the theory for a positive scalar self coupling .",
    "this is interesting since ads space - times have risen in importance over the last few years in the context of the correspondance between string theory and co !",
    "nformal field theory @xcite .",
    "the value of the curvature of the ads space - time is a constant but not fixed . outside input",
    "must enter to stabilize the scale of the breaking of conformal invariance .",
    "we speculate this might come from the renormalization scale of the quantum corrections of the matter fields .",
    "we also show numerical evidence for localized soliton solutions of the magnetic monopole type in the specific theory of the conformally coupled georgi - glashow @xcite model .",
    "similar solutions have been found for the case of einstein gravity or string inspired gravity with yang - mills and higgs fields , @xcite , however no one has studied the case of conformal gravity .",
    "our solutions have a non - singular core developing into an asymptotically anti - de - sitter space - time .",
    "such solutions would correspond to massive particles in the theory .",
    "conformal gravity is a theory of gravitation , developed on the assumption of conformal symmetry and general covariance .",
    "the geometrical structure used to translate the principle of covariance into a mathematical language is the tensorial calculus on pseudo - riemannian differential manifolds , endowed with a metric and symmetric ( i.e. torsionless ) connection , in which the metric tensor is with negative signature : in the following , we will use the convention @xmath3 ; for this geometrical theory , all local properties of the space are described by the riemann tensor .",
    "riemann tensor is defined by the connection of the space ; and the connection is given by the definition of the covariant derivative . in the following , we will represent the covariant derivative with respect to the coordinate @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "riemann curvature tensor will be represented by @xmath6 , one contraction gives the ricci curvature tensor @xmath7 and further contraction gives the curvature scalar @xmath8 .",
    "the tracefree part of the riemann tensor , called the weyl tensor @xmath9 , is shown to be conformally invariant ( see , for example , @xcite ) , that is , given any function @xmath10 , we can perform a transformation of the metric tensor as @xmath11 for which indeed the weyl tensor is invariant @xmath12 then , the tensorial calculus on pseudo - riemannian differentiable manifolds in which all local properties of the space are described by weyl tensor is what mathematically represents the principles of conformal invariance and general covariance .",
    "on the basis of such a theory , the action must be invariant under scale and coordinates trasformations , that is , it has to be a scalar built up using only weyl tensor .    since weyl tensor is tracefree , we can not form any scalar by taking its contractions ; the only way we have to obtain a scalar is to contract the products of two weyl tensors : considering two weyl tensors and contracting each index of one with an index of the other , we get only one possible choice for the conformally invariant scalar we are looking for .",
    "thus , the action defined as @xmath13 is the unique action constructed using only the metric , which is invariant under ( local ) conformal and coordinate transformations ; it will be our choice for the action of the gravitational field .",
    "the action for a gravitational field in presence of other fields is obtained as follow @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant , with @xmath16 a scalar such that @xmath17 under conformal transformations .",
    "when an explicit choice for the matter content is made , we must specify the conformal transformation properties of the corresponding fields to ensure the overall transformation property ( [ ct ] ) .",
    "the tensor @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 @xmath20 is symmetric , tracefree and its covariant @xmath21-divergence vanishes .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is defined by varying the term @xmath16 in the action with respect to the metric tensor @xmath22 @xmath23 is symmetric , its @xmath21-divergence vanishes and , in the case of conformal theories , it is tracefree . the action given in equation ( [ ac ] ) yields the field equations @xmath24 evidently both sides are symmetric , tracefree and covariantly conserved .",
    "we consider a gauge potential as @xmath25 @xmath21-vectors @xmath26 ( we put gauge group indices in parenthesis to avoid confusion with spatial indices ) .",
    "this gives the field strength @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the structure constants of the lie algebra of the gauge group .",
    "the field strength transforms according to the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "we introduce the higgs boson , also in the adjoint representation , as @xmath25 scalars @xmath29 .",
    "the gauge covariant derivative of higgs bosons is given by @xmath30 the action for the higgs bosons in interaction with the gauge field is given by the standard form @xmath31 we can extend the conformal transformations for the gauge fields as follow @xmath32 which implies immediately @xmath33 and for the higgs as @xmath34 which gives @xmath35 this implies that the action given in equation ( [ act ] ) is not conformally invariant .",
    "however , we can actually taking into account that the trace of the curvature scalar is not conformally invariant it is possible to couple it with higgs fields , to give a conformally invariant action .",
    "such a modification was first considered in the context of massless free scalar fields by penrose and grsey @xcite .",
    "the modifcation was further elaborated upon by callan , coleman and jackiw @xcite with respect to the definition of the energy momentum tensor , and it has recently been further discussed by jackiw @xcite . for a general overview of conformal transformations see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the transformation property of the higgs bosons given by equations ( [ h],[dh ] ) implies @xmath36.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however the scalar curvature transforms as @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we can choose a term of the form @xmath38 for which it is actually possible to get the conformal invariance",
    ". in @xmath21-dimensions , taking the factor @xmath39 equal to @xmath40 makes the sum @xmath41 and consequently , the whole action , conformally invariant .",
    "in addition , we can add the higgs quartic self - coupling given as @xmath42 , which is conformally invariant and a gauge invariant scalar by itself .",
    "finally , the conformally invariant action is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the gauge coupling constant ; this action describes gauge fields in interaction with higgs bosons in conformally invariant gravitation .",
    "we can introduce the compact notation for which @xmath45 ; we see that in the action ( [ acti ] ) the last two terms do not contain derivatives of the scalar field , therefore , they can be seen as a non - minimal potential for the scalar field @xmath46 this is not the potential usually considered in higgs mechanism , since the term @xmath47 is proportional to the scalar curvature @xmath48 , which is not the mass of higgs field , nor a constant ; this non - minimal potential can provide for spontaneous breaking of the conformal and gauge symmetry .",
    "non - constant curvatures produce unusual non - local structures as has been recently found in @xcite ) .",
    "we confine ourselves , in this paper , to the classical aspects of the theory .",
    "we consider the case of positive quartic scalar self - coupling , @xmath49 .",
    "this case is required for stability in flat backgrounds .",
    "the case for which the scalar curvature is a constant corresponds to maximally symmetric spaces ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the constant scalar curvature is then given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the dimension and @xmath52 a constant : when @xmath53 the space - time is simply minkowski space , when @xmath54 the space - time is called de - sitter space and for @xmath55 the space - time is called anti - de - sitter ( ads ) space . (",
    "note that these identifications are convention dependent . ) for @xmath54 the only a stable equilibrium is with @xmath56 ; on the other hand for @xmath55 a stable equilibrium is obtained with @xmath57 , i.e. symmetry breaking corresponds to positive values of the constant scalar curvature , namely , in ads space - times .",
    "we will make the _ ansatz _ that the ads geometry is only asymptotical , that is only the boundary of the space - time is geometrically an ads space . in asymptotically ads space - times , then , we will set the numerical value of the scalar curvature at the boundary of the space - time to be equal to @xmath58 , with @xmath59 an arbitrary constant . in this case",
    ", @xmath60 is the solution which asymptotically gives the spontaneous breakdown of the gauge symmetry , giving mass to some of the gauge fields via the higgs mechanism .",
    "it is important to stress the fact that gauge symmetry breaking produces massive fields , which are no longer conformally invariant , thus it also implies that the conformal symmetry is broken in the process .",
    "the non minimal potential for the scalar field also serves to induce the einstein action for the metric . indeed ,",
    "if the scalar field is non zero in a local region , we can choose the conformal gauge @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an arbitrary , non zero constant .",
    "then the net effect of the non minimal scalar potential is to induce the einstein action for the metric fluctuations , in a conformal to de sitter background .",
    "in the georgi - glashow model the basic assumption is that we have a triplet of higgs bosons and a triplet of gauge fields for which the symmetry group is @xmath0 , namely , the structure constants of the lie algebra are the completely anti - symmetric @xmath63-dimensional coefficients of ricci - levi - civita @xmath64 the field strength is given by @xmath65 and the gauge covariant derivative for higgs bosons is given by @xmath66    we can introduce the @xmath63-dimensional notation , for which we can put @xmath67 and @xmath68    with this notation , we have @xmath69 and the gauge covariant derivative for higgs bosons is given by @xmath70 then , we can set @xmath71 and @xmath72 and also @xmath73 finally , we have @xmath74 and @xmath75 furthermore , we can define the nther s charges for the triplet of scalars as follow @xmath76    the total energy - momentum tensor is defined according to ( [ emt ] ) @xmath77 however , we can isolate the contribution due to the gauge field alone @xmath78 and the remaining part is then written as @xmath79 we point out that now all the dependence on the scalar field is in the tensor @xmath80 , which contains terms related to the interaction of the higgs fields with the gauge field and gravity one ( for further discussion , see , for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "given the gauge symmetry group , and the @xmath63-dimensional notation , it is possible to write the action @xmath81      the geometrical configuration of the spacetime we want to study is chosen to be stationary and spherically symmetric , i.e. the distribution of energy does not depend on time and it is isotropically distributed around the origin , hence , the symmetry group of the spatial isometries is @xmath0 .",
    "this structure for spatial isometries allows us to consider @xmath63 linearly independent @xmath21-dimensional killing vectors in spherical coordinates @xmath82 , given as follows @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 for which @xmath86=\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\xi_{(k)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correct representation of the symmetry group for @xmath0 .",
    "the line element in spherical coordinates has to be isotropic , that is there exists a system of coordinates in which it has the form @xmath87 it has been noted by mannheim and kazanas ( @xcite ) that , via a sequence of coordinate and conformal transformations , one can always bring the general static , spherically symmetric metric to a form in which @xmath88 .",
    "thus it is justified to set @xmath89 for a smooth function @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 given this line element , we can compute the curvature tensors ; the riemann tensor has all the components equal to zero except for @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 while the ricci tensor has all the component vanishing except for @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 and finally , the scalar curvature is given by @xmath102 and in these coordinates , the asymptotic condition on the scalar field is @xmath103      in the following , we will make an _ ansatz _ based on the idea that the lowest energy solutions are those with the maximal symmetry ( see @xcite and @xcite and also , for example , @xcite ) , which is @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the spatial symmetry @xmath0 is actually the same we as the gauge symmetry .",
    "the explicit assumptions on the components of the fields are ( in cartesian coordinates ) , for the gauge fields : @xmath104 @xmath105 for the higgs field : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 have to be fixed by the field equations . in terms of the @xmath63-dimensional notation",
    "they are @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the unity vector along the @xmath112 axis while for the higgs @xmath113 since the frame we have chosen is in spherical coordinates , we must write all of the fields in spherical coordinates @xmath114 . for the scalar fields a simple calculation gives @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 for the gauge fields we notice that the explicit expression for the killing vectors for @xmath0 in cartesian coordinates",
    "is given by @xmath118 and these are proportional to the explicit expressions of the gauge fields themselves ; thus we find the conditions @xmath119 these conditions immediately give us all the properties of @xmath120 , knowing @xmath121 : thus the expression for the gauge potentials in spherical coordinates is easily seen as @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 now we are able to write down explicitly the fields strength and the gauge covariant derivatives of this theory ; the most important are listed as follow , defining @xmath125 we get for the field strength @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 the non - abelian electric and magnetic fields are given by @xmath132 and @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 in which the arrow represents the vectors in the internal space as always .",
    "the non - abelian magnetic field has a radial part that is parallel in internal space to the scalar field .    with this",
    ", we can write the explicit form for the terms in the action @xmath136 and @xmath137 so , we have the complete expression in spherical coordinates for both the gauge and the higgs fields , giving the whole action in spherical coordinates : @xmath138dr .\\label{fe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we are now able to obtain the field equations of the theory , ( varying the action with respect to the scalar fields , the vector fields and the metric ; respectively , ) . for higgs field",
    "we get @xmath139 for gauge fields @xmath140 and for the metric @xmath141 the coupling constant @xmath15 is absorbed into the coupling constants @xmath44 and @xmath142 and into the scalar field by an appropriate rescaling .",
    "one can confirm the tracelessnes of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath143 as it should be in a conformal theory and also see that the conservation laws are satisfied @xmath144 and @xmath145 the whole system of field equations then is @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath146 and , in the last equation , spherical coordinates and spherical symmetry imply that only the diagonal equations are non - trivial .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath147 and @xmath148 , hence , only one of the angular equations is independent . using the constraint of tracelessness we can , in fact ,",
    "remove this angular equation , leaving only the temporal and the radial equations .",
    "finally it can be proven ( see @xcite and @xcite ) that only one of the these two remaining equations is independent : so , we can choose a linear combination of the radial and the temporal one , to get the field equation for gravity @xmath149 here the prime is the derivative with respect to @xmath150 . the symmetries imposed reduce the higgs field equations to the one independent equation @xmath151 and the gauge field equations reduce to @xmath152 thus , the entire set of field equations is @xmath153 @xmath154 @xmath155 containing the three unknown functions @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath112 .",
    "this result can also be obtained by varying the @xmath0 symmetric action ( [ fe ] ) with respect to @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath112 .",
    "we define the core of the monopole as that region in which we have nonzero density of nther s charge . the external solution is considered to be the solution outside this definition of the core . outside the core the vanishing nther s density allows a non - trivial solution @xmath158 .",
    "this is non - trivial because there is a long range monopole like magnetic field .",
    "it is possible to solve the field equations exactly for this external solution .",
    "a solution which supportts spontaneous symmetry breaking of the conformal symmetry simply requires that @xmath157 is not identically @xmath159 .",
    "we are interested in solutions of the form @xmath160 . given this , the only possible solution for the metric is given as @xmath161 , which recovers a part of the general vacuum solution found by mannheim and kazanas ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this solution can be summarized as follow @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 for any value of the free parameter @xmath165 and for any positive value of the parameter @xmath59 , which can be changed by conformal scaling .",
    "in addition , note that the full form of the mannheim - kazanas matter free solution , @xmath166 , can be recovered by taking @xmath167 but allowing @xmath168 for @xmath169 constants .",
    "this makes the term @xmath170 in equation ( [ e1 ] ) vanish .",
    "when @xmath171 the coefficients @xmath172 are are given by @xmath173 , @xmath174 , while @xmath175 are unconstrained .",
    "when @xmath176 we get @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 with @xmath165 a free parameter .",
    "if instead we assume that the scalar field takes the value which minimizes the scalar potential @xmath180 , which is properly seen as a stabilty criterion , the solutions are given by , for @xmath171 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , and our preferred solution , for @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "when @xmath187 the solution given above in equations ( [ sol1])-([sol3 ] ) is reproduced .",
    "we emphasize that all the previous considerations hold away from singularities , since the fourth order derivative of the function @xmath156 is the radial component of a fourth order laplacian , an operator whose action on a @xmath188 term yields the derivative of a delta function ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the solution ( [ sol3 ] )",
    "we can see the presence of the schwarzschild solution , which allows us to recover einstein gravitation at short distances .",
    "the quadratic term , which is dominant at large distances , gives rise to a constant , positive scalar curvature for the positive @xmath189 .",
    "hence , the space - time is asymptotically anti - de - sitter .",
    "we note that this solution does _ not _ reproduce the part @xmath190 of the reissner - nordstrom solution corresponding to charged , spherically symmetric distributions of matter .",
    "the reason is simple : in conformal gravitation the equation of motion for the metric components is fourth order in derivatives , not second order as in the einstein theory .",
    "the integration of these equations precludes the appearance of the reissner - nordstrom behaviour .",
    "the higgs field solution ( [ sol2 ] ) is a vector in the @xmath63-dimensional internal space , with a ( positive ) constant norm and radial direction , therefore topologically non - trivial .",
    "finally , the feature that the `` gauge field '' @xmath112 in the solution ( [ sol1 ] ) vanishes means that the original gauge field @xmath191 behaves as @xmath192 .",
    "this , together with the topologically non - trivial higgs field , leads us to the fact that the gauge fields give rise to a non - zero magnetic field strength that is purely radial , and proportional to the higgs field in the internal space : @xmath193      for the problem concerning a more general solution , i.e. a solution which can take into account also the internal behaviour as well as the external one , we can try to find a solution via numerical calculations .",
    "the latter field equations need eight initial conditions to be given at the origin which specify a unique solution .",
    "a simple mathematica program finds the solutions of the type that we are looking for .",
    "a set of initial conditions can be chosen to give the solution    , @xmath107 and @xmath194 for @xmath195.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] [ fig : plot of the solutions ]    it is worthwhile to point out that the function @xmath112 related to the gauge field tends to vanish as the radius goes to infinity ; correspondingly the scalar field tends to a constant value , determined by the asymptotical quadratic behaviour of the gravitational conformal field .",
    "conformal gravity is an interesting alternative theory of gravitation . it is simpler than einstein gravity",
    "since it does not have a scale , it has a unique action in minimal number of derivatives and it has greater symmetry .",
    "however , the lack of conformal invariance in our observable universe must be addressed if conformal gravity is to be seriously considered as an alternative theory of gravitation .",
    "the conformal invariance could be spontaneously broken , explicitly broken or anomalously broken as elucidated by mannheim @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have studied a classical theory coupling matter and gravitational degrees of freedom in a conformally invariant manner .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking produces a scale in the theory . the actual value of this scale is not fixed by the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "mannheim showed that a nonzero vev for the scalar field conformally coupled to weyl gravity is consistent with a de - sitter geometry for a negative and anti - de - sitter geometry for positive , quartic scalar self - coupling .",
    "we have studied the situation where the vev is consistent with anti - de - sitter geometry with a positive scalar self - coupling .",
    "we have additionally been able to find localized , topological soliton solutions in this theory .",
    "these solitons represent massive , particle states in the theory .",
    "this gives us some optimism and avenues for further research in the conformal theory of gravitation .",
