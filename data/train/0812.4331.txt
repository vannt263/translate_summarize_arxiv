    "the coefficients of this linear functional form the rank-4 tensor of elasticity @xmath10 , which is , in general , a function of frequency .",
    "this tensor describes a stress response to a time dependent deformation of the system . in a macroscopically isotropic two - dimensional ( 2d )",
    "system subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field the rank-4 tensor @xmath11 contains only three independent components and can be parametrized by three dynamic `` elastic moduli '' @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the moduli @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe the response to a local change in volume and to a local volume - preserving ( shear ) deformation , respectively .",
