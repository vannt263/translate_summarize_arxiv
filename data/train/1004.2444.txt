    "very recently , belle collaboration reported the newest charmonium like state , the @xmath8 , which is observed in @xmath9 with a statistical significance of 7.7@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "it has the mass @xmath11  mev and width @xmath12  mev .",
    "belle collaboration determined the @xmath8 production rate @xmath13 or @xmath14 for @xmath15 or @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath8 is similar to the previously discovered @xmath17 by belle and confirmed by babar collaboration in the process @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the mass and width of the @xmath17 obtained by belle are : @xmath19 mev , @xmath20 mev  @xcite .",
    "however , babar obtained @xmath21 mev , @xmath22 mev  @xcite .",
    "the difference of the mass and width of @xmath23(3940 ) might be the attribute to the large data sample used by babar ( 350 fb@xmath24 compared to belle s 253 fb@xmath24 ) , which enabled them to use smaller @xmath25 mass bins in their analysis @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath8 have same mass and width , and are both seen in @xmath26 .",
    "hence they might be same states pointed out in refs.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 as a conventional @xmath27 charmonium interpretation is disfavored @xcite .",
    "the mass of this state is well above the threshold of @xmath28 or @xmath29 @xcite , hence open charm decay modes would dominate , while the @xmath25 decay rates are essentially negligible , which is same as @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "however , according to the production rate obtained by belle , eqs.([xgamma1 ] ) and ( [ xgamma2 ] ) , we obtain the @xmath30 ( 1 mev ) if we assume @xmath31 ( 1@xmath32 2 kev ) which is typical for an excited charmonium state @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 ( 1 mev ) is an order of magnitude higher than typical rates between known charmonium states , which imply that there is intricate structure for the @xmath8 . in our previous study @xcite ,",
    "the quantum number and mass of @xmath33 is compatible with the @xmath8 .",
    "however , the calculated strong decay width is much larger than experimental data .",
    "hence , the assignment of @xmath8 to the charmonium @xmath33 state is very unlikely .    in the previous work ,",
    "liu  @xcite suggested @xmath17 is probably a molecular @xmath4 states with @xmath5 or @xmath34 in a meson - exchange model . assuming the @xmath4 bound - state structure , branz @xcite studied the strong @xmath35 and radiative @xmath36 decay widths in a phenomenological lagrangian approach .",
    "their results are roughly compatible with the experimental data about @xmath17 . by the qcd sum rules ,",
    "zhang @xcite also obtained the mass @xmath37 gev for @xmath4 , which is consistent with @xmath17 reported by babar . using su(3 ) chiral quark model and solving the resonating group method equation , liu and zhang  @xcite also studied molecular @xmath4 states with color singlet meson - meson structure , the bound state of @xmath4 may appear if the vector meson exchange between light quark and antiquark is considered .    although at present the data for the @xmath2(3915 ) and @xmath17 are still preliminary , and whether the @xmath8 is the same as the @xmath17 needs to be identified , it is worthwhile to discuss its possible assignments , especially in view of the great potential of finding new particles .",
    "we assume the @xmath2(3915 ) and @xmath17 as same state in the following study . in this work we study the @xmath38 with molecular @xmath4 structure by taking into account of the coupling of different color structures in the bhaduri , cohler and nogami ( bcn ) quark model , since the color singlet tetraquark state @xmath39 can be consisted of colorless or colored @xmath40 and @xmath41 two - quark mesons .",
    "the role of the _ * hidden color * _ in @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) has been discussed by brink and stancu @xcite , and then extended to study other four - quark systems  @xcite .",
    "the bcn quark model was proposed by bhaduri , cohler and nogami  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the interaction between quark pair is composed of linear color confinement , color coulomb and color magnetic interaction from one - gluon - exchange .",
    "this model has been widely used to study @xmath44 meson , @xmath45 baryon @xcite and four - quark system @xcite range from light quark @xmath46 to heavy quark @xmath47 with same set of parameters .",
    "the molecular state bound by a one - gluon exchange interaction in the bcn quark model can be depicted in fig .",
    "[ bcnmolecule ] . one - gluon exchange interaction exist between pair of quark - quark or quark - antiquark in color structure @xmath1 , while no interaction between meson - meson in color structure @xmath0 .",
    "hence there is no bound state in fig.[bcnmolecule](a ) .",
    "however , the bound state is possible within hidden color channel ( color structure @xmath1 , fig.[bcnmolecule](b ) ) .",
    "( a ) and @xmath1 ( b ) in the bcn quark model .",
    "the darkened and open circles represent quarks and antiquarks , respectively . ]",
    "the numerical method , which is able to provide reliable solutions , is very important for calculating the energy of few - body systems . in this work",
    ", the spectra of normal and exotic mesons are obtained by solving the schdinger equation using a variational method : gaussian expression method ( gem ) , which is a high precision numerical method for few body system . the detail about gem can be seen in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we show the hamiltonian and parameters of bcn quark model .",
    "section [ wf ] is devoted to discuss the wave function of @xmath8 and similar state @xmath48 with @xmath49 quark replaced by @xmath47 quark . in section",
    "[ result ] , we present and analyze the results obtained by our calculation . finally , the summary of the present work is given in the last section .",
    "the hamiltonian of bcn model takes the form , @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the kinetic energy of central - mass of whole system .",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath55 are the su(2 ) pauli and the su(3 ) gell - mann matrices , respectively .",
    "the @xmath56 should be replaced by @xmath57 for the antiquark .",
    "the universal parameters of this model @xcite are listed in table [ parameters ] .",
    ".parameters of the bcn model . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in summary , we have studied the possible molecular states of @xmath8 and similar state @xmath48 with @xmath47 quark replacing c quark by taking into consideration of the coupling of different color structures in bcn model . in the quark model",
    ", there is no net interaction between two color singlet mesons . to form the molecular state ,",
    "the hidden color channel must be introduced . by considering the hidden color channel and the coupling between color singlet channel and the hidden color channel , bounded states @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "are obtained . in our calculation",
    ", the @xmath8 can be interpret as @xmath58 with @xmath5 , which is in agreement with the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the experimental data about the @xmath2(3915 ) is preliminary , further confirmation by other experimental collaborations is necessary .",
    "the role of the hidden color can be tested in multi - quark system if the @xmath2(3915 ) is identified as a molecular state @xmath58 with @xmath5 . at present , we only have a limited understanding for the puzzling state @xmath2(3915 )",
    ". a systematical study of the role of hidden color in different four - quark configurations will help us to understand the effects of hidden color configurations .",
