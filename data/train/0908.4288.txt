    "omplex networks reveal essential features of the structure , function , and dynamics of many complex systems @xcite .",
    "while networks from diverse fields share various properties @xcite and universal patterns @xcite , they also display enormous structural , functional and dynamical diversity . a basic measure of diversity is assortativity by degree ( hereafter assortativity ) : the tendency of nodes to link to nodes with a similar number of edges @xcite ) . despite its importance ,",
    "no disciplined approach to assortativity in directed networks has been proposed . here",
    "we present such an approach and show that measures of directed assortativity provide a number of insights into the structure of directed networks and key factors governing their evolution .",
    "assortativity is a standard tool in analyzing network structure @xcite and has a simple interpretation . in assortative networks with symmetric interactions ( i.e. , undirected networks ) , high degree nodes , or nodes with many edges ,",
    "tend to connect to other high degree nodes .",
    "hence , assortative networks remain connected despite node removal or failure @xcite , but are hard to immunize against the spread of epidemics @xcite . in disassortative networks ,",
    "conversely , high degree nodes tend to connect to low degree nodes @xcite ; these networks limit the effects of node failure because important nodes ( with many edges ) are isolated from each other @xcite .",
    "assortativity has a convenient global measure : the pearson correlation ( @xmath0 ) between the degrees of nodes sharing an edge @xcite .",
    "it ranges from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , with ( @xmath3 ) in assortative networks and ( @xmath4 ) in disassortative ones .",
    "earlier work proposed a simple classification of networks on the basis of assortativity , in which social networks are assortative and biological and technological networks are disassortative @xcite .",
    "recent work suggests that this classification does not hold for undirected networks : many online social networks are disassortative @xcite .",
    "we go further , demonstrating that the simple assortative / disassortative dichotomy misses fundamental features of networks where edge direction plays a crucial role .",
    "in fact , we show that many networks are neither purely assortative nor disassortative , but display a mixture of both tendencies .",
    "these patterns provide a classification scheme for networks with asymmetric interactions",
    ".    in directed networks , an edge from source to target ( @xmath5 ) represents an asymmetric interaction ; for example , that web site a contains a hyperlink to web site b , or organism a is eaten by organism b. edge direction is essential to evaluate and explain local structure in such networks . for instance , motif analysis @xcite identifies local connection patterns that appear more frequently in the real - world network than in ensembles of randomized networks . in this context ,",
    "edge direction distinguishes functional units like feed - forward and feedback loops . taking edge direction into account",
    "also overturns the simple picture of the world wide web ( www ) as having a short average distance between all webpages @xcite in favor of a richer picture of link flow into and out of a dense inner core @xcite .",
    "more recently , attempts to identify communities in directed networks have demonstrated that ignoring edge direction misses key organizational features of community structure in networks @xcite .",
    "hence it is striking that assortativity in directed networks has been studied only by ignoring edge direction entirely @xcite or by measuring a subset of the four possible degree - degree correlations @xcite .",
    "all four degree - degree correlations were addressed in the specific contexts of earthquake recurrences @xcite and the www @xcite using the average neighbor degree , e.g. @xmath6 , as a measure rather than the pearson correlation .",
    "however , it is easier to interpret and assign statistical significance to the pearson correlation .",
    "moreover , the average neighbor degree can not be easily used to quantify the diversity of a given network or to compare networks of various sizes , unlike the pearson correlation .",
    "incorporating edge direction into familiar assortativity measures based on pearson correlation is an essential step to better characterize , understand , and model directed networks . indeed , since they scale as @xmath7@xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of edges in the network , our directed assortativity measures can be evaluated for large networks that are beyond the reach of current motif analysis or community detection algorithms .    here",
    "we analyze online and social networks , food webs , and word - adjacency networks .",
    "classes of directed networks show common patterns across the four directed assortativity measures : @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ; @xmath12 ; and @xmath13 .",
    "the first element in the parentheses labels the degree of the source node of the directed edge and the second labels the degree of the target node .",
    "thus @xmath11 quantifies the tendency of nodes with high in - degree to connect to nodes with high out - degree , and so on ; see fig .",
    "we compare the real - world network with an ensemble of randomized networks .",
    "this comparison allows us to assign statistical significance to each measure .",
    "we use that significance to define an assortativity significance profile for each network .",
    "this profile allows us to distinguish between networks grouped together by other measures ; indeed , we find that online and social networks , which have similar motif structure @xcite , have substantially _ different _ assortativity profiles . the class - specific profiles point to forces or constraints that may guide the structure , function and growth of that class @xcite .",
    "we also uncover limitations of several theoretical network models .",
    "for example , neither of two plausible models of word - adjacency networks ( one proposed by milo et al .",
    "@xcite , the other in this paper ) can reproduce the directed assortativity profile we observe in the real - world networks .",
    "a standard model of the www @xcite is similarly unsuccessful . on the other hand ,",
    "the food web models @xcite examined here reproduce the pattern of assortativity seen in different food webs .",
    "hence our measures provide useful benchmarks to test models of network formation .",
    "table 1 provides descriptions and sources for all networks examined in this paper ; table 2 collects the full results including error estimates .",
    "since nodes in directed networks have both an in - degree and an out - degree , we introduce a set of four directed assortativity measures . fig .",
    "1 illustrates this set , with examples typical of assortative or disassortative networks .",
    "let @xmath14 index the degree type , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 be the @xmath17- and @xmath18-degree of the source node and target node for edge @xmath19 .",
    "then we define the set of assortativity measures using the pearson correlation :    @xmath20}{\\sigma^{\\alpha}\\sigma^{\\beta}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the number of edges in the network , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are similarly defined . in each correlation",
    "the edges point from the node with the @xmath17-indexed degree to the node with the @xmath18-indexed degree ( _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "we assign errors by jackknife resampling @xcite and plot @xmath25-error bars in the figures .    to estimate statistical significance",
    ", we compare the degree - degree correlations for each real - world network to a null model .",
    "we use as our null model the ensemble of randomized networks with the same in- and out - degree sequence ( number of nodes @xmath26 with in - degree @xmath27 and out - degree @xmath28 ; hereafter degree sequence ) as the original network @xcite ( _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "the comparison distinguishes features accounted for by the degree sequence from those that might reflect other forces or constraints .",
    "our method assigns each correlation @xmath29 a statistical significance through its @xmath30-score :    @xmath31}.\\ ] ]    this quantifies the difference between the assortativity measure of the real - world network @xmath32 and the average assortativity for that measure in the randomized ensemble @xmath33 in units of the standard deviation @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "larger networks typically have larger @xmath30 scores ( see table 2 ) . to compare networks of various sizes ,",
    "the @xmath30-scores are normalized @xcite by defining an assortativity significance profile ( asp ) , where @xmath35 .",
    "this quantity is directly related to the @xmath30 score , and for a given network the normalization does not change the relative size of the significance measures . to separate less significant correlations ,",
    "we indicate @xmath36 in all figures by an appropriately colored asterisk . a positive @xmath37 or asp@xmath38 (  @xmath30 assortative \" ) indicates that the real - world network is more assortative in that measure than expected based on the degree sequence .",
    "a negative @xmath37 or asp@xmath38 (  @xmath30 disassortative \" ) means that the original network is less assortative than expected .",
    "we first consider online and social networks . in an online network ,",
    "edges represent hyperlinks . in the social networks considered here ,",
    "edges represent positive sentiment .",
    "online networks are built collaboratively and share motif patterns with social networks , leading them to be grouped in the same  superfamily \" @xcite .",
    "2a shows the asp of the world wide web sample and two social networks studied in @xcite .",
    "each network differs significantly in its asp , showing that the asp discriminates between networks with similar motif structure .",
    "2b shows the asp of the www , wikipedia @xcite , and a network of political blogs @xcite .",
    "all three networks are @xmath39 @xmath30disassortative , indicating that the small disassortative effects measured previously @xcite represent substantial deviations from expected behavior .",
    "this may reflect different growth mechanisms and/or functional constraints .",
    "the www and wikipedia are also @xmath40 @xmath30 assortative .",
    "this property indicates that pages with high in - degree ( corresponding to  authorities `` @xcite ) link to pages with high out - degree ( useful pages @xcite ) more frequently than expected based on the degree sequence .",
    "pages can be both authorities and useful , and in the www these ' ' multihubs \" are highly interconnected ; this effect creates the @xmath40 correlation , along with a tendency for low in - degree nodes to connect to low out - degree nodes .",
    "all three online networks show no assortative or disassortative tendency in the @xmath41 or @xmath42 measures , consistent with previous work on the average neighbor in - degree in wikipedia @xcite .",
    "the effects of @xmath30-assortative or disassortative behavior can be huge , e.g. an increase of @xmath43 in the number of connections from the top @xmath44 of in - degree nodes ( hereafter in - hubs ) to the top @xmath44 of out - degree nodes ( hereafter out - hubs ) in the real - world leadership network , compared to the randomized ensemble .",
    "the smallest change is a @xmath45 decrease ( blogs , in - hub to out - hub ) .",
    "the @xmath40 effect for the www is substantial : an @xmath46 increase in connections from in - hubs to out - hubs .",
    "models of online network growth should reproduce the qualitative features of each online @xmath29 , @xmath37 and @xmath47 .",
    "we tested a directed preferential attachment model for the www ( _ materials and methods _ ) @xcite .",
    "this model fails to generate any of the asp characteristics of the www ( fig .",
    "2c ) . as shown in fig . 2d",
    ", @xmath11 is small in the growth model , whereas @xmath48 is large for the www .",
    "this difference arises because the growth model fails to generate many connections between multihubs orbetween low in- and low out - degree nodes .",
    "thus @xmath29 and @xmath47 for the three online networks can not be attributed to the degree sequence or simple models of network growth",
    ". the @xmath39 @xmath30 disassortativity may reflect that hyperlinking and ( more generally ) information have a hierarchical structure , e.g. the existence of distinct ",
    "high - level \" topics  much as disassortativity in protein interaction networks captures the existence of weakly connected modules @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath40 assortativity and @xmath30 assortativity of the www are especially pertinent for how users navigate the web .",
    "high in - degree nodes ( authorities ) may gain their status by aggregating links to useful pages ( with high out - degree ) .",
    "this pairing of trusted authorities and useful pages would provide broad access to relevant information on the web .",
    "we find that more than half of the authorities ( in - hubs ) are also useful ( out - hubs ) : hence they may become authorities by themselves being useful .",
    "we further find that these multihubs connect preferentially , whereas pages with low in - degree connect preferentially to pages with low out - degree .",
    "these results are consistent with the bowtie structure revealed by a much more computationally costly analysis @xcite : a densely interconnected and highly navigable core , with less trusted or useful pages clumping into small clusters or chains .",
    "we now turn to food webs @xcite . recall that a directed edge from species a to species b means that a is eaten by b. food webs from diverse ecosystems display universal properties , e.g. , a common form for the in- and out - degree distributions @xcite .",
    "previous work indicated that food webs are disassortative in the @xmath39 measure @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3a , although @xmath10 is disassortative for all food webs @xcite , we see a wide range of values from @xmath30-disassortative to @xmath30-assortative in the @xmath39 asp measure of fig . 3b .",
    "thus , once the degree sequence is taken into account , no common pattern remains in this measure .",
    "in contrast , food webs are both disassortative and @xmath30-disassortative in the @xmath40 measure .",
    "this means that organisms with many prey species are eaten by organisms with few predator species ( and _ vice versa _ ) more frequently than expected .",
    "this tendency captures the structuring of ecosystems into trophic levels @xcite , and is consistent with an overall  spindle \" shape to the food web ( fewer species in the upper and lower levels and a greater number in the middle ) @xcite .",
    "the small number of species at lower trophic levels follow from the general practice of aggregating the lowest units of the food web into one or a few nodes broadly labeled  plant , \"  detritus , \" etc .",
    "the consumers of these lowest units have low in - degrees and are in turn consumed by predators of low trophic level ( with high out - degrees ) .",
    "the food webs are assortative and @xmath30 assortative in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 measures ( though in the case of ythan only slightly ) ; since species at the same trophic level should have similar in- and out - degrees , these results may indicate that species are eating species at the same or similar trophic level  a signature of omnivory @xcite  more frequently than expected based on the degree sequence .",
    "the effects of @xmath30-assortative or disassortative behavior on linking between hubs range from a @xmath49 increase ( little rock , in - hub to in - hub ) to a @xmath50 increase ( coachella , in - hub to in - hub ) .",
    "to identify the origin of these patterns , we built two theoretical models for each web ( _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "the _ cascade _ model assigns each species a random  niche \" value and allows species to eat species of lower value with some probability @xcite .",
    "the _ niche _ model relaxes this rigid hierarchy , permitting cannibalism and the eating of species with higher niche value @xcite .",
    "c and 3d shows the @xmath29 and @xmath47 for the cascade and niche models of a particular food web ( st . marks @xcite ) .",
    "the model webs shown are typical of the model , and qualitatively reproduce the pattern observed in fig . 3 a and b. the _ ensemble _ of niche model realizations for a given food web , however , displays large variance ( see table 3 ) , favoring the cascade model as more predictable .",
    "these results suggest that ordering species along a single niche dimension largely explains the observed patterns in @xmath29 and @xmath47 for food webs .",
    "neither model , however , typically generates the @xmath39 @xmath30 assortativity seen in certain food webs .",
    "finally , we analyze word - adjacency networks , where edges point from each word to any word that immediately follows it in a selected text @xcite . for example , ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the word - adjacency networks are strongly disassortative for @xmath29 ; see fig .",
    "4b shows that they are also strongly disassortative in their asp .",
    "the effects on linking between high degree nodes are relatively small , ranging from a decrease of @xmath52 ( english book , out - hub to out - hub ) to a decrease of @xmath53 ( japanese book , out - hub to out - hub ) .",
    "the in- and the out - degree of nodes in these networks are both increasing functions of word frequency @xcite ; thus the correlation between a node s in - degree and out - degree is high ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "very high frequency words generally have grammatical function but low  semantic content \" @xcite . while the large @xmath55 guarantees similar values for all four measures , disassortativity could result from at least two possible mechanisms .    milo _",
    "propose a bipartite model ( _ materials and methods _ ) , with a few nodes of one type representing high frequency  grammatical \" words and many nodes of a second type representing low frequency content words ; grammatical words must be followed by content words , and _",
    "vice versa _ @xcite .",
    "the bipartite model reproduces the motif pattern of word - adjacency networks , and is thus assigned to the same superfamily in this scheme @xcite .",
    "this model generates negative values across all @xmath29 , as shown in fig .",
    "4a , but these values are too large compared to the real network . when compared to the rewired ensemble , however , the model reproduces the roughly equal , negative asp@xmath38 of the actual networks ; see fig .",
    "thus our measures do not support the classification of the bipartite model network with the real networks .",
    "alternately , the observed disassortativity could result from a broad word - frequency distribution ( zipf s law @xcite ) .",
    "we scrambled the english text @xcite to produce a text with identical word - frequency distribution but no grammatical structure ( _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "the scrambled text model has @xmath29 very close to the empirical values [ fig 4a ] , but it is @xmath30-assortative across all measures [ fig 4b ] , unlike the real - world networks . neither model yields the relative magnitude of asp@xmath39 and asp@xmath40 , suggesting that this difference results from genuine linguistic structure",
    "our results demonstrate the fundamental importance of edge direction and the advantages of assortativity  when properly extended  in the analysis of directed networks .",
    "our most basic observation is that directed networks are structurally diverse : many directed networks are not purely assortative or disassortative , but a mixture of the two .",
    "our measures apply to any directed network , and we expect similar diverse but class - specific mixtures to arise in other directed networks . by comparison with randomized ensembles , we are able to detect statistically significant features like @xmath40 assortativity in the www .",
    "our measures display common patterns for classes of similar networks ( see figures 5 and 6 ) , and can be compared to a local analogue , the triad significance profile ( tsp ) .",
    "the tsp assigns each possible three node subgraph ( motif ) a normalized @xmath30 score by comparing the number of appearances of the subgraph in a real - world network to the average number in a randomly rewired ensemble ; classes of networks have similar tsps @xcite .",
    "the measures @xmath29 , @xmath37 and asp@xmath38 are more computationally tractable and scalable than motif analysis ; they also discriminate between networks grouped together by tsp ( online / social ) , while confirming the motif - based classification of word - adjacency networks @xcite , correctly grouping the online networks ( although the political blogs only weakly ) , and classifying food webs together . as illustrated by all three classes , @xmath29 and asp@xmath38 are best used together for exploring the structure of the real - world networks and testing theoretical models .",
    "we tested models for all three network classes .",
    "the preferential attachment model of www growth @xcite does not generate the observed @xmath40 assortativity in the www .",
    "neither the bipartite @xcite nor the scrambled text model of word adjacency networks generates realistic patterns in both @xmath29 and asp@xmath38 .",
    "we note that creating a mixture of assortative and disassortative behavior is non - trivial .",
    "while the www growth model fails to do so , both food web models @xcite succeed .",
    "we suggest that they do so by remaining close to the basic features of the phenomenon .",
    "our measures can be used to test models for any type of directed network and thus validate or falsify the prevailing theoretical understanding .",
    "the straightforward interpretation of directed assortativity leads to a variety of questions : for example , do the overabundant connections between authorities and useful pages in the www reflect demands of network navigation , facilitating the spread of user flow  whereas the negative @xmath11 in food webs reflects the opposite tendency to concentrate energy flows at higher trophic levels ? such questions suggest further applications of these concepts to build models better tailored to the reality of asymmetric interactions in complex networks .",
    "newman @xcite defines @xmath0 in terms of the excess degree , i.e. the degree of the node minus @xmath2 .",
    "the correlation coefficients are exactly the same if the degree itself is used @xcite .",
    "identical @xmath30-score results are obtained for any assortativity measure that is related to the pearson coefficient @xmath29 by a linear transformation , e.g. the @xmath56 metric of alderson and li @xcite ; thus when statistical significance is properly measured , it is sufficient to use the pearson coefficient .",
    "we sample the ensemble of randomized networks with the same fixed degree sequence ( fds ) @xcite using a monte carlo rewiring algorithm .",
    "the algorithm starts with a directed network with a given in- and out - degree sequence @xmath26 and , by randomly swapping directed edges between nodes , samples from the fds ensemble .",
    "if the starting network contains self - edges , we allow them in the sampled networks ; otherwise we reject such rewiring steps .",
    "we always forbid multiple edges . to assure random sampling",
    ", we performed @xmath57 edge swaps between samples for most ensembles , @xmath58 for www and related models , and @xmath59 for the wikipedia network . before sampling the fds ensemble",
    ", we performed 10 times the number of intersample edge swaps on the starting network to ensure sampling of typical networks .",
    "we assume that errors in ensemble averages are normally distributed and that after @xmath19 samples the difference between the mean value of an observable up to that point @xmath60 and the final mean @xmath61 is less than @xmath62 in absolute value , for some constant @xmath63 . plotting the difference as a function of @xmath64 and choosing @xmath63 to contain approximately @xmath65 of the data points gives an estimate of the error in the final mean , reported in table 2 as @xmath66 .      the growth model for the world wide web",
