    "neutron star soft x  ray transients ( sxrts ) when in outburst closely resemble persistent low mass x  ray binaries ( lmxrbs ) . in the last few years",
    "it has become clear that sxrt sources form a rather inhomogeneous class ( see campana et al .",
    "1998a for a review ) comprising sources with well defined outbursts as well as sources with long on / off activity periods .",
    "moreover , sources displaying bright outbursts with peak x  ray luminosities @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 appear to be different from sources showing only faint outbursts reaching @xmath7  erg  s@xmath6 , especially in the galactic center region ( heise et al .",
    "1998 ; king 2000 ; int zand 2001a ) .",
    "a major leap forward came with the discovery of sax j1808.43658 , a bursting sxrt reaching a maximum luminosity of @xmath8 ( for a distance of 2.5 kpc ; int zand al .",
    "2001b ) . in april 1998",
    "the source resumed activity and rxte observations revealed coherent @xmath9  hz pulsations , the first detected in the persistent emission of a neutron star lmxrb .",
    "these testify to the presence of magnetic polar cap accretion onto a fast rotating magnetic neutron star ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ; chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) . the inferred magnetic field strength of sax  j1808.43658 is in the @xmath10  g range ( see psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) , providing convincing evidence for the long suspected lmxrb - millisecond pulsar connection .",
    "sxrts spend much of their time in quiescence . the origin of the quiescent x  ray emission is still uncertain . in the last few years",
    "several sources have been studied in detail ; the picture that emerged is that the quiescent spectrum consists of a soft component plus a high energy excess .",
    "the former component is often fit with a blackbody spectrum with an equivalent radius of 12  km and temperatures in the 0.10.3  kev range or with a neutron star atmosphere model with an equivalent radius consistent with the entire neutron star surface and slightly smaller temperatures ( brown et al .",
    "1998 ; rutledge et al .",
    "the high energy component is well represented by a power law with photon index @xmath11 ( asai et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; campana et al .",
    "1998b , 2000 ) . in all sources observed so far the quiescent luminosity ranges between @xmath12 , indicating a clear difference with black hole transients in quiescence that have a lower x  ray luminosity ( garcia et al .",
    "2001 ; campana & stella 2000 ) . flux and spectral variability have been reported in aql x-1 and ks 1731260 during quiescence ( campana et al .",
    "1997 ; rutledge et al . 2002 ; wijnands et al .",
    "this poses severe limitations on the emission mechanisms responsible for the quiescent luminosity .    among neutron star sxrts",
    ", sax j1808.43658 stands out for having , while in outburst , a magnetosphere and , of course , an accurately measured spin period .",
    "these characteristics make the source very well suited for testing the predictions of models for the quiescent emission in which the presence of a sizeable magnetic field plays a crucial role ( stella et al .",
    "sax j1808.43658 was detected in quiescence ( stella et al .",
    "2000 ; dotani et al . 2001",
    "; wijnands et al .",
    "2001 ) though with large uncertainties . here",
    "we report on an xmm - newton observation of sax  j1808.43658 in quiescence , the first to detect the source with a good signal to noise ratio .",
    "sax j1808.43658 was observed on march 24 2001 with xmm - newton epic , consisting of two metal oxide semiconductor ( mos ) cameras ( watson et al .",
    "2000 ) and one pn camera ( strder et al . 2000 ) .",
    "medium filters were used for the mos cameras and the thin filter for the pn camera .",
    "the pn camera was operated in timing mode in order to search for pulsations in case the source were sufficiently bright .",
    "sax j1808.43658 turned out to be faint ( see below ) , preventing meaningful searches for pulsed emission .",
    "we do not discuss the pn camera data in the following and concentrate on data from mos cameras that were operated in full frame mode with a read - out time of 2.6 s.    we extracted the event file starting from the raw data using the standard analysis system ( sas ) version 5.3.0 .",
    "data were manually screened to remove any remaining bright pixels or hot columns",
    ". periods in which the background was high because of soft proton flares were excluded using an intensity filter : we rejected all events accumulated in the external ccds ( 27 ) when the total count rate exceeded 15 counts in 100 s in the 1012.4 kev band for the mos1 and mos2 , independently .",
    "we obtained a net exposure time of 33.2 ks and 34.4 ks for mos1 and mos2 , respectively ( this is slightly different from what reported in campana et al .",
    "2002 , due to the use of standard processed files with sas 5.0.3 ) .",
    "spectra were accumulated separately for mos1 and mos2 .",
    "event grades higher than 12 were filtered out .",
    "photons were grouped within xmmselect to the nominal mos resolution of 15 ev .",
    "previous observations aiming at determining the position of sax j1808.43658 were performed with bepposax ( stella et al . 2000 ; wijnands et al .",
    "2002b ) and asca ( dotani , asai & wijnands 2000 ; see table 1 ) , but due to the limited angular resolution of these satellites the resulting picture was quite confused .",
    "in particular it was unclear whether the source revealed at a low flux of @xmath13 and with large positional uncertainties was indeed sax j1808.43658 ( see fig . 1 and tab .",
    "1 ) . in fact , wijnands et al .",
    "( 2002b ) claimed that sax j1808.43658 was only detected in the asca data of september 1999 , while neither bepposax observations detected the millisecond pulsar but rather revealed a nearby source , sax j1808.63658 .",
    "the deep image we obtained with epic allowed us to clarify this confused picture by revealing several faint sources in the region .",
    "source detection was obtained following the prescriptions of baldi et al .",
    "this revealed 20 sources in the central part ( @xmath14 ) of the field of view .",
    "the brightest one was clearly coincident with the radio position of sax j1808.63658 .",
    "a few other sources were contained in the error regions of sources previously seen with asca and in the longer bepposax observation ( see fig .",
    "a faint source is visible about @xmath15 east of sax j1808.43658 ( ra(j2000 ) : 18@xmath16 08@xmath17 36@xmath18.6 ; dec(j2000):36@xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is within the error region of the source detected by wijnands et al .",
    "( 2002b ) in the march 2000 bepposax observation .",
    "if it had the same luminosity that we measure with epic ( a count rate a factor @xmath22 lower than that of sax j1808.43658 ) , it was probably too faint to be detected by bepposax , but a small contamination from this source could perhaps explain why all the error regions for sax j1808.43658 derived with low angular resolution instruments are systematically centered to the east of the radio position .",
    "a further bias is provided by a @xmath23 to the brighter source east ( ra(j2000 ) : 18@xmath16 08@xmath17 42@xmath18.2 ; dec(j2000):36@xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath24 ) which has a comparable flux to sax j1808.43658 and went undetected in previous observations ( wijnands et al .",
    "furthermore , given the source density revealed in this field by xmm - newton , the probability of finding by chance at least one source within the bepposax @xmath25 error circle of sax j1808.63658 is @xmath26 .",
    "it appears to be unlikely that this faint source was much brighter and at the same time sax j1808.43658 much fainter just during the bepposax observations and conclude that sax j1808.43658 was the source detected both in march 1999 and march 2000 .      in total",
    "we collected 91 and 77 counts with the mos1 and mos2 detectors , respectively , within a @xmath27 radius circle centered on the position of sax j1808.43658 .",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath28 of the source flux for energies between 15 kev ( extending the extraction region would just decrease the signal to noise ratio , due to the background and source faintness ) .",
    "the background was extracted from an annular region with inner and outer radii of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( excluding contaminating sources ) , respectively . within the sax j1808.43658 extraction region , about @xmath31 of the counts are to be attributed to the local background .",
    "the mos1 and mos2 spectra were rebinned to contain at least 15 photons per channel .",
    "the spectral analysis was carried out with xspec v.11.1.0 .",
    "we adopted the latest on - axis standard response matrices ( m1_medv9q20t5r6_all_15.rsp and m2_medv9q20t5r6_all_15.rsp ) and correct the fluxes for the fraction of photons collected within the extraction radius .",
    "the spectral analysis was carried out in the 0.37 kev energy range ( kirsch private communication and 2002 ) . given that the cross calibration between mos1 and mos2 agrees within @xmath32 ( kirsch 2002 ) we did not include a constant for the two mos instruments .",
    "the statistics was relatively poor and the spectrum could be well fit by an absorbed power law ( or a bremsstrahlung ) model ( see table 2 and fig .",
    "a power law model gave a better fit ( @xmath33 ) with @xmath34 ( @xmath25 confidence level ) and a column density of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 @xmath25 c.l .",
    ", we used here the wisconsin cross sections in the wabs model ) .",
    "we note that a model with the column density fixed at the value derived from the source data in outburst ( e.g. gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 ) and consistent with the galactic value of @xmath37 , provides also a good fit with @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( with a null hypothesis probability of @xmath40 ) .",
    "the unabsorbed 0.510 kev luminosity of sax j1808.43658 was @xmath41 for the power law model and a ( revised ) distance of 2.5 kpc ( int zand et al .",
    "single component black body or neutron star atmosphere models ( gaensicke , braje & romani 2002 ) did not provide an adequate fit to the data with @xmath42 .",
    "given that the best studied quiescent sxrts display a soft black body component plus a hard power law tail we consider also this model ( even though strictly not required by the data ) . in this case",
    "we fixed again the column density to @xmath43 .",
    "the power law fit alone could adequately describe the data so that we first fixed the best fit power law and derived constraints on the black body component .",
    "sxrts in quiescence display black body temperatures ranging between 0.10.3 kev ( e.g. rutledge et al .",
    "by using this range we derived a @xmath25 upper limit to the normalization of the black body component and in turn on the ( unabsorbed , bolometric ) soft black body flux of @xmath44 .",
    "this corresponds to a factor of 15 less than the power law luminosity in the 0.510 kev band .",
    "if we repeat the same exercise with a neutron star atmosphere model ( gaensicke , braje & romani 2002 ) we derive a factor of 30 less luminosity in the soft component . alternatively , by fixing the normalisation ratio of the black body and power law components as observed in the best studied quiescent sxrts ( e.g. campana et al .",
    "1998b , even if recent observations on aql x-1 challange this picture , rutledge et al . 2002 ) we obtained a very low black body temperature . by fixing also the column density to @xmath37 we succeeded in obtaining a good fit @xmath39 with a black body temperature of @xmath45 kev and a power law @xmath46 .",
    "the source flux is in any case low @xmath47 . with a neutron star atosphere model",
    "we obtain an equally good fit ( @xmath39 ) with a temperature @xmath48 kev and an emitting radius @xmath49 km .",
    "the high throughput and good angular resolution of xmm - newton provided the first firm determination of the quiescent luminosity of sax j1808.43658 .",
    "this is lower by a factor of @xmath50 than previous best fit estimates .",
    "however , once the large uncertainties in the spectral parameters are taken into account , a fairly constant luminosity is inferred since march 1999 at a level of @xmath51 ( at a distance of 2.5 kpc ; note that the reduced @xmath52 of a fit with a constant is 1.8 , @xmath53 null hypothesis variability , see fig .",
    "we conclude that the source variability issue raised by dotani et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is questionable .",
    "the source luminosity is a factor of two lower than that usually measured in sxrts in quiescence ; this ranges between @xmath12 ( e.g. campana et al .",
    "1998a ; campana & stella 2000 ; garcia et al .",
    "2001 ) . for a distance of 4 kpc , however , it would be fully consistent with what usually observed in other sxrts .    more interestingly , if we consider the spectral fit with a power law component plus a black body , the soft x ",
    "ray component comprises only a small part ( @xmath2 ) of the total luminosity , whereas in the great majority of sxrts it accounts for about half of the luminosity in the 0.510 kev energy band ( e.g. campana et al .",
    "1998b , 2000 ; see however rutledge et al .",
    "the soft component is usually ascribed to the cooling of the neutron star surface powered by the deep nuclear heating that the neutron star receives during each outburst ( brown et al .",
    "1998 ; rutledge et al .",
    "2000 ; colpi et al .",
    "2001 ; see also campana et al .",
    "rxte all sky monitor ( asm ) provides us with a continuous monitoring of the high level activity of sax j1808.43658 . from these data",
    "we can extrapolate a mean mass transfer rate of @xmath54 yr@xmath6 , in line with previous estimates ( bildsten & chakrabarty 2001 ) .",
    "this mean mass inflow rate translates into a soft quiescent luminosity of @xmath55 within the 0.510 kev energy band from deep crustal heating ( brown et al .",
    "1998 ; colpi et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath56 higher than observed .",
    "given the fact that predictions from deep nuclear heating are quite robust , one is led to conclude that an additional source of cooling is present .",
    "a simple and well known solution is when the direct urca process is allowed in the neutron star core and , in turn , neutrino cooling does affect the neutron star thermal evolution ( colpi et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this can occur only for massive neutron stars with masses higher than @xmath57 .",
    "if this interpretation were correct the neutron star of sax j1808.43658 have to be fairly massive , in agreement with accretion spin - up scenarios .",
    "the main contribution to the quiescent luminosity of sax j1808.43658 appears to derive from the power law component .",
    "a pure propeller contribution is ruled out since this mechanism should stop operating at a luminosity of about @xmath58 , with the turing on of a radio pulsar ( e.g. campana et al .",
    "1998a , 1998b ) .",
    "one interpretation for this power law relies on the emission at the shock front between the relativistic wind of a radio pulsar and matter outflowing from the companion star ( see the discussion in stella et al .",
    "being the first sxrt for which the presence of a sizable magnetic field is unambiguously established , sax j1808.43658 can be used to infer the efficiency @xmath59 with which spin - down power is converted into 0.510 kev luminosity .",
    "we derive @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is neutron star magnetic field ( as derived from the accretion luminosity at the propeller onset , gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 ; see also psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) .",
    "recently , an ideal laboratory for studying the shock emission has been discovered : this is psr j17405340 , a 3.7 ms radio pulsar in a 32.5 hr orbit around a roche lobe filling main sequence companion , which display partial and total eclipsed over a wide range of orbital phases ( damico et al .",
    "2001 ; ferraro et al . 2001 ; burderi , dantona & burgay 2002 ) .",
    "the x  ray luminosity of psr j17405340 measured by chandra ( @xmath62 , 0.52.5 kev range , unabsorbed ; grindlay et al .",
    "2001 ) implies @xmath63 . taking this system as a prototype for modelling the shock emission power ( which is likely less efficient since the radio pulsar is not completely engulfed ) and scaling the efficiency as the square of the orbital separation , one infers @xmath64",
    ", well consistent with the value above , given the uncertainties involved .",
    "we thank a. baldi for the source detection algorithm and a. de luca for the image hot pixels cleaning procedure .",
    "we acknowledge useful comments by an anonymous referee which helped improving the paper ."
