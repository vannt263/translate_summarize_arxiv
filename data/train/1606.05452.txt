    "over the past decade , the in - medium investigation of fundamental parameters of hadrons such as their mass , decay constant , widths and strong coupling constants among various hadrons has become one of the hot topics in hadron physics .",
    "such investigation can help us not only better analyze the hot and dense qcd matter produced by heavy ion collision experiments , bu also can help us get valuable knowledge on the perturbative and nonperturbative natures of qcd .",
    "investigations of parameters of different members of light baryons can also provide us with useful information on the structure of dense astrophysical objects like neutron stars since at the center of the neutron stars there can be intensively produced the strange members of octet baryons as well as the decuplet baryons beside the nucleons .",
    "the theoretical studies on the hadronic parameters at finite temperature have mainly been devoted to mesons .",
    "there are a few studies dedicated to the studies of the light baryons in hot medium .",
    "it is well known that the investigation of parameters of both the decuplet and octet baryons at finite temperature is very important in understanding of the su(3 ) flavor chiral symmetry breaking . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the temperature dependence of the pole mass of the octet and decuplet baryons is investigated using the chiral perturbation theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the baryon masses at finite temperature has been investigated in both the octet and decuplet representations for the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) and polyakov - nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) models .",
    "it has been obtained that the baryon masses decrease by increasing the temperature and there is a strong dependence on the melting or deconfinement temperature determined by the flavor content of the baryons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mass of the decuplet baryons at finite temperature are investigated using thermal qcd sum rules . in this paper",
    ", the authors find that below @xmath5 the masses show very little dependence on the temperature , but decrease with increasing temperature above this point .",
    "the self energy of the @xmath0-baryon is also investigated at finite temperature and density using the real time formalism of thermal field theory in ref .",

    "the aim of this article is to extend our previous studies on the thermal properties of nucleon and hyperons @xcite and evaluate the behavior of the mass and residue of the decuplet @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 baryons with respect to temperature employing the thermal qcd sum rule method .",
    "this method is the extended version of the vacuum qcd sum rule @xcite to finite temperature and first introduced by bochkarev and shaposhnikov @xcite .",
    "this method has two new aspects compared to the case of zero temperature : the lorentz invariance is broken at finite temperature with the choice of reference frames , to restore of which the four - velocity vector of the medium is introduced ; and some new operators appear in the operator product expansion ( ope ) at finite temperature and the vacuum condensates are replaced by their thermal expectation values . in our calculations , we use the thermal quark propagators containing new non - perturbative contributions coming up in the wilson expansion at finite temperature .",
