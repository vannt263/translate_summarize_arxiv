    "a number of interesting features of the iron - based superconductors have attracted much attention . among them",
    "is the material dependence of the superconductivity .",
    "not only the transition temperature @xmath3 , but also the form of the superconducting gap seems to be material dependent .",
    "for instance , although a number of experiments suggest that the gap is fully open on the fermi surface on some of the arsenides , there are several experiments suggesting the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap lafepo@xcite , bafe@xmath0(as@xmath4p@xmath5)@xmath0 @xcite , or in lifep@xcite . also in the electron - doped 122 systems , ba(fe@xmath4m@xmath5)@xmath0as@xmath0(m = co , ni )",
    ", the presence of gap nodes has been suggested.@xcite    for lafepo , theoretical studies suggest the presence of nodes on the electron fermi surface around the wave vector @xmath6 in the unfolded brillouin zone .",
    "@xcite from this viewpoint , the heavily hole doped end material kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 is of special interest because in this material , the electron pockets present in most of the iron - based superconductors are known to be absent due to the low position of the fermi energy.@xcite nonetheless , the material becomes superconducting , and interestingly , several experiments suggest the presence of nodes in the gap .",
    "@xcite since there are no appreciable electron pockets in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , the nodes are likely to be on the hole fermi surface .",
    "theoretically , a possibility of @xmath2-wave pairing has been proposed recently.@xcite    another interesting observation in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 is the spin fluctuations found in neutron - scattering experiments . in ref . , incommensurate spin fluctuation has been observed , and we have theoretically provided its explanation in terms of the multiorbital nature of the fermi surface .    given this background , the aim of the present study is to understand the relation between the spin fluctuations and the superconducting gap of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "we first construct a ten - orbital model for kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and also obtain a five - orbital model by approximately unfolding the brillouin zone .",
    "we adopt three - dimensional models in order to take into account the possible variation of the superconducting gap along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "we apply random phase approximation to these models and compare the calculation results at high temperature , which gives reasonable agreement , although the brillouin zone unfolding is not exact . then , we go down to low temperature using the five - orbital model .",
    "we first summarize our understanding on the origin of the incommensurate spin fluctuations@xcite and also analyze its strength when the material composition is varied from bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 to kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "we finally discuss the superconducting gap when cooper pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations .",
    "an analysis based on the linearized eliashberg equation shows that @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave pairings are found to be in close competition , and the former is found to have essentially the @xmath8-wave form in the sense that the gap function around the wave vector @xmath9 ( where the hole fermi surfaces exist ) and around @xmath6 ( where the electron fermi surface would have existed in a less doped material ) has the opposite sign .",
    "this sign change is driven by the incommensurate spin fluctuation , which is due to the interband interaction between states around ( 0,0 ) and @xmath6 . since the electron fermi pockets are absent , the latter states are somewhat away from the fermi level , so that this interband sign change of the gap function should not be detected experimentally . as for the possible explanation of the nodes of the gap observed experimentally ,",
    "we raise several possibilities concerning the hole fermi surface .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "there are ten @xmath16 bands because there are two iron atoms per unit cell in the body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) lattice structure . around the x point ,",
    "the electron fermi surfaces , which are present in iron pnictides with fewer holes , are absent .",
    "nonetheless , the band that gives rise to the electron fermi surface for smaller number of holes sits very close to the fermi level .",

    "also around the z point there is a tiny hole fermi pocket .    for 122 systems ,",
    "the brillouin zone unfolding procedure@xcite that adopts the reduced unit cell ( with one iron ) can not be done strictly,@xcite namely , the hopping integrals that go out from and come into fe1 and fe2 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) are somewhat different .",
    "nonetheless , if we adopt a reduced unit cell by neglecting the difference , we end up with an approximate five - orbital model.@xcite we show the band structure and the fermi surface of this model in fig .",

    "the correspondence between the unfolded st and the folded bct brillouin zone is shown in fig . [ fig1](d ) .",
    "as seen from this correspondence , the band structure of the five - orbital model can be refolded into the original bct brillouin zone by translating the bands in the second bct brillouin zone by a wave vector ( @xmath21,@xmath21,@xmath21 ) .",

    "all of the hole fermi surfaces are very cylindrical , so that the two - dimensionality is strong . however , if we look at the orbital character , @xmath20 and @xmath19 fermi surfaces have strong @xmath14 and @xmath15 character , respectively , regardless of @xmath7 , while the @xmath18 fermi surface is mainly composed of @xmath23 orbital around the z point , while the @xmath14 character becomes stronger around the @xmath17 point . in this sense , @xmath18 can be considered as less two - dimensional compared to the other two - hole fermi surfaces .    in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ theory ] , we show similar vertical cuts of the fermi surface for the five - orbital model , refolded into the original brillouin zone .",
    "the result in most portions is close to that obtained for the ten - orbital model , but the @xmath18 hole fermi surface , which is a cylinder in the latter , splits into a three - dimensional pocket around the z point and a strongly warped cylinder .",
    "this split occurs between portions of the fermi surface having strong @xmath13 and @xmath14 character .",
    "although this may seem like a large difference , the effect of this splitting is not so large as far as the quantities we focus on are concerned , as we shall see later .",
    "for the many - body part of the hamiltonian , we consider the intraorbital @xmath24 , the interorbital @xmath25 , the hund s coupling @xmath26 , and the pair hopping interaction @xmath27 .",
    "we consider orbital - dependent interactions,@xcite and the interaction part of the hamiltonian is given as @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the sites and @xmath30 , @xmath31 stand for the orbitals .",
    "we apply random - phase approximation ( rpa ) to this model and obtain the spin and charge susceptibility matrices .",
    "namely , using the bare green s function @xmath32 @xmath33 in the orbital representation , the irreducible susceptibility matrix is given as @xmath34 the spin and the charge ( orbital ) susceptibility matrices are obtained as @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are interaction vertex matrices .",
    "we refer to the largest eigenvalue of the matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 as the stoner factor and the spin susceptibility , respectively .",
    "the magnetic instability is signaled by the stoner factor exceeding unity . in the rpa calculation ( where the self - energy correction is neglected ) , adopting the interaction values evaluated by first - principles calculation@xcite easily results in a magnetic instability even at high temperature , so we multiply all the electron - electron interaction by a constant factor @xmath42@xcite .    to analyze superconductivity , the green s function and the effective singlet pairing interaction , @xmath43",

    "the slight difference in the stoner factor results in a difference in the peak value of the spin susceptibility , but the @xmath52 position at which the spin susceptibility is maximized is the same between the two models .",
    "it can also be seen from this figure that the three - dimensionality of the spin fluctuations is very small .    in fig.[1025gap ] , we compare the superconducting gap for the two models in the folded brillouin zone . for the five - orbital model ,",

    "since the fermi surface is different between the two models for some @xmath7 portions , the gap function differs between the two at those portions of the fermi surface .",

    "we find that for both of the band structures , the spin fluctuation becomes commensurate around @xmath69 .",
    "for both of the models , it is found that the peak position continuously moves from the commensurate to the incommensurate position as holes are doped,@xcite indicating that the spin fluctuation has the same origin in the entire ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 system , namely , the interband scattering between the band around @xmath9 and @xmath6 .    the stoner factor obtained for the above models",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ chi](d ) as functions of the band filling .",
    "this shows that the strength of the spin fluctuations is stronger for the model of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 than in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 when compared at the same band filling .",
    "therefore , when the composition of the material is changed continuously from ba to k , we would expect the spin fluctuation to be maximum around the undoped regime ( the ba - rich regime ) , and decreases when the holes are doped by ba@xmath70k replacement .",
    "however , in the heavily hole doped regime ( the k - rich regime ) , the strength of the spin fluctuations should barely decrease , and may become even stronger with hole doping approaching the end material kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "as for the electron - hole asymmetry of the incommensurability of the spin fluctuations , we have analyzed its origin in ref . as follows .",
    "the spin fluctuations are mainly governed by the interaction between portions of the fermi surface having similar orbital character , so in fig .",
    "[ orbcha](a)-(d ) , we show the strength of the orbital character on the fermi surfaces of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xmath71 and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 with @xmath57 in the unfolded brillouin zone . here",
    "we plot the states within a finite energy range @xmath72 with @xmath73ev , which can contribute to the spin fluctuations .",
    "although fermi surfaces near the wave vector @xmath6 are barely present in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , there are states in the vicinity of the fermi level originating from a nearly flat band lying close to the fermi level .",
    "the position of this flat band with respect to the fermi level can be clearly seen in the magnifications of figs . [ fig1](a ) and 1(b ) . as mentioned in ref .",
    ", the spin fluctuations develop at wave vectors which bridge the portions of the fermi surface having similar orbital character .",
    "the wave vectors connecting @xmath15 orbital portions and those connecting @xmath61 ( or @xmath74 , not shown ) portions nearly coincide in each of the two cases , so that this wave vector should correspond to the peak position of the spin fluctuations . in the electron - doped case ,",
    "the connecting wave vector deviates from @xmath51 toward @xmath68 , while in the hole - doped case it deviates toward @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the difference of the spin fluctuation incommensurability between electron- and hole - doped cases originates from the multiorbital nature of the system .",
    "finally , we discuss the superconducting gap of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "we obtain the superconducting gap at @xmath62ev for @xmath1-wave and @xmath75-wave pairings . here",

    "[ fig7 ] the @xmath1-wave ( a ) and @xmath2-wave ( b ) gap functions of the five - orbital model refolded into the original folded brillouin zone . here",
    "we take the interaction reducing rate @xmath77 .",
    "the rate @xmath42 is increased compared to the values adopted for the spin susceptibility because here we focus only on kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , so that the stoner factor does not exceed unity even for this @xmath42 .",
    "we take larger values of the interaction so as to enhance the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation , which enables us to obtain a more reliable form of the superconducting gap .",
    "the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation is @xmath78 and @xmath79 , close to unity .",
    "these values indicate that the pairing symmetry competition is close .",
    "in fact , the possibility of @xmath2-wave pairing was proposed in a recent functional renormalization group study@xcite and an effective hamiltonian approach.@xcite even at this low temperature , the gap is essentially similar to the one obtained at higher temperature in sec . [ 1025sec ] .",
    "the @xmath1-wave gap is basically @xmath8-wave in the sense that the gap function changes sign between the states near @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the origin of this sign change is strongly related to the spin fluctuation discussed in the present section .",
    "namely , although the fermi surface is barely present around @xmath81 , there are states in the vicinity of the fermi level originating from the bands that produces the electron fermi surface for smaller hole content .",
    "the pair scattering from those states to the hole fermi surface and vice versa mediated by the incommensurate spin fluctuations is the origin of the sign change of the gap function . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath2-wave pairing originates essentially due to the intraband repulsive interaction .",
    "in fact , we find that the spin fluctuations originating from the intraband interaction ( within the hole fermi surfaces ) develops especially for the band filling below @xmath53 .    -wave ( a ) and @xmath75-wave ( b ) at @xmath62ev .",
    "the solid black lines represent the fermi surfaces , while dashed red lines are the nodes of the gap .",

    "the arrow indicates the intraband scattering that drives the sign change.,width=170 ]    although the origin of the stabilization of the @xmath1-wave gap is the incommensurate spin fluctuation and the gap function ( eigenfunction of the eliashberg equation , to be strict ) changes its sign between @xmath82 and @xmath83 , theoretically , the fermi surface around the latter wave vector is barely present for kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , so , experimentally , this sign change should not be detectable .",
    "however , there are several possibilities of ( nearly ) vanishing gap function , which may be relevant to the experimental observations that suggest the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap .",
    "first , the @xmath1-wave superconducting gap on the @xmath15 fermi surface is rather small .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) that the nodal line runs somewhat close to the @xmath15 fermi surface .",
    "this may experimentally be detected as nearly vanishing gap , although there is no actual sign change in the gap function here .",
    "second , the @xmath1-wave gap on the @xmath18 fermi surface has different signs between the @xmath7 plane that includes the @xmath17 point and that with the z point , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) .",
    "this means that the gap has horizontal nodes on the @xmath18 fermi surface , which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) .",
    "although the five - orbital model is not reliable concerning this portion of the fermi surface , this sign change is also found in the ten - orbital model ( at higher temperature ) as seen in fig .",
    "[ 1025gap ] in sec.[1025sec ] .",
    "the sign change in this @xmath18 hole fermi surface is a common feature found in the rpa studies of the 122 systems,@xcite and indeed some recent experiments@xcite support this possibility in phosphorous doped 122 materials .",
    "third , there is a possibility of a @xmath2-wave gap , which is in close competition with the @xmath1-wave .",
    "this possibility , however , may not be consistent with an experiment on the magnetic vortex lattice , which shows that the gap is not strongly anisotropic within the planes.@xcite",
    "in the present study , we have constructed an approximate five - orbital model of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and compared it with the original ten - orbital model .",
    "we find the former to be reliable as far as the peak position of the spin fluctuations and form of the gap function are concerned .",
    "using the five - orbital model , we have investigated the spin fluctuations and the spin - fluctuation - mediated superconducting gap of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "we find that the spin fluctuation has an incommensurate peak structure , whose origin is the multiorbital nature of the fermi surfaces .",
    "the peak position of the spin fluctuation is in excellent agreement with the experiment.@xcite    as for the superconductivity , @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave pairings are found to be in close competition .",
    "the @xmath1-wave gap has essentially the @xmath8-wave form in the sense that the gap function changes its sign between the wave vectors around @xmath9 and @xmath6 . although there are barely fermi surfaces around @xmath6 , the states in the vicinity of the fermi level are nonetheless effective to give the incommensurate spin fluctuations and thus the sign change in the superconducting gap function .",
    "although the sign change exists in the gap function , this should not be detectable in experiments because the fermi surface is barely present around @xmath84 .",
    "as for the explanation for the nodes in the superconducting gap observed experimentally , besides a possible @xmath2-wave pairing , we raise two possibilities for the @xmath1-wave pairing : either horizontal nodes in the @xmath85 fermi surface or the small gap on the entire @xmath15 fermi surface .",
