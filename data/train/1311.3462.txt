    "polarization is an important degree of freedom for photons .",
    "polarization - entangled photons are fundamental quantum resources in quantum information processing for many applications , such as quantum key distribution @xcite , photon amplifiers @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum computation @xcite . the widely used technique for generating the polarization - entangled state is based on a spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) process , which can be arranged in various configurations and with different crystals @xcite .",
    "recently , polarization - entangled photons from a periodically poled @xmath0 ( ppktp ) crystal in a sagnac interferometer configuration has become a hot topic , since this source has the merits of compactness , stability and high brightness .",
    "et al _ , demonstrated the first entangled photon source with a ppktp crystal in a sagnac - loop with a continuous - wave ( cw ) pump laser at 405 nm in 2006 @xcite .",
    "then , fedrizzi _ et al _ , presented an optimized scheme with a cw pump laser in 2007 @xcite .",
    "however , the cw pumped spdc source can not provide any timing information about when the photon pair is generated , which is important for applications such as synchronization with system clocks in quantum communication systems .",
    "therefore , kuzucu and wong developed a pulsed sagnac polarization - entangled source at 780 nm in 2008 @xcite . in 2012 , predojevi _ et al _ , investigated the phase property of this system @xcite .",
    "now this ppktp - sagnac scheme has become a common tool for the generation of polarization - entangled state and has applied in many experiments @xcite .",
    "however , in all the previous experiments @xcite , the entangled photons were generated at around 800 nm wavelength . in this work , we expand such pulsed ppktp - sagnac scheme into a group - velocity matched ( gvm ) regime and demonstrate a gvm - ppktp - sagnac scheme at the telecom wavelength .",
    "the concept of gvm in spdc was introduced by grice and walmsley @xcite , and by keller and rubin @xcite in 1997 .",
    "ppktp crystal with gvm condition was first experimentally investigated by knig and wong @xcite for second - harmonic generation in 2004 .",
    "the gvm condition in spdc has been experimentally realized in kdp crystal at 830 nm wavelength @xcite , ppktp crystal at around 1584 nm wavelength @xcite , and bbo crystal at 1550 nm wavelength @xcite .",
    "the gvm condition in spontaneous four - wave mixing has also been demonstrated in optical fibers @xcite . in the case of ppktp crystal",
    ", the gvm condition means @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the inverse of the group velocity @xmath6 for the pump @xmath7 , the signal @xmath8 , and the idler @xmath9 .    with the gvm condition ,",
    "the ppktp crystal may have a high spectral purity at telecom wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the spectral purity , a parameter describing the degree of spectral uncorrelation between the signal and idler photons , is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the reduced density operator of the signal ( @xmath8 ) or idler ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath12 represents the partial trace .",
    "the spectral purity is calculated by applying schmidt decomposition on the join spectral amplitude of the signal and idler photons .",
    "see @xcite for more details about spectral purity .",
    "see @xcite for the experimentally measured joint spectral intensities of the gvm - ppktp crystal by several different groups . here",
    ", we compare the maximal intrinsic spectral purity of ppktp crystal at around 800 nm and 1550 nm in fig . [",
    ". the maximal intrinsic spectral purity of 0.16 at the 800 nm range is much lower than that at the 1550 nm range , 0.82 .",
    "spectral purity is of paramount importance for experiments with multi - entangled - source .",
    "for example , in the entanglement swapping @xcite or multi - photon entangled state generation experiments @xcite , the spectral purity of each source must be highly pure to achieve high interference visibilities @xcite . at 800 nm , to improve the purity from 0.16 to unity , we need to adopt very narrow bandpass filters to improve the purity , and the brightness will be largely decreased .",
    "however , only coarse bandpass filters can improve the purity from 0.82 to near unity at telecom wavelength range @xcite . therefore , in principle , the gvm - ppktp - sagnac photon source at telecom wavelengths might be much brighter than the ppktp - sagnac scheme at the 800 nm range for multi - entangled - source applications .    besides the high spectral purity ,",
    "another important merit of our gvm - ppktp - sagnac scheme is that such high - quality polarization - entangled photons at telecom wavelengths are suitable for long - haul transmission using low - loss optical fibers .",
    "this establishes the basis for many quantum info - communication applications at telecom wavelength .",
    "furthermore , low - efficiency photon detectors were obstacles for the telecom - band experiments , but the rapid development in superconducting nanowire single photon detector ( snspd ) technologies has overcome this disadvantage . in this paper , we demonstrate an ultra - bright polarization entangled photon source with high spectral purity , and detected by state - of - the - art snspds developed by our group .",

    "then the pulses were focused by a @xmath13 mm lens ( beam waist @xmath14 45 @xmath15 m ) , reflected by a dichroic mirror ( dm : dmlp1180 , thorlabs ) and guided into a sagnac - loop . the sagnac - loop consisted of a dual - wavelength polarization beam splitter ( dpbs , extinction ratio @xmath16 200 : 1 , union optics ) ,",
    "a dual - wavelength hwp ( dhwp , for both 792 nm and 1584 nm , union optics ) , and a 30-mm - long ppktp crystal with a polling period of 46.1 @xmath15 m for a type - ii collinear group - velocity - matched spdc . the temperature of the ppktp was maintained at @xmath17 to achieve a degenerate wavelength at 1584 nm .",
    "the ppktp crystal was pumped by clockwise ( cw ) and counterclockwise ( ccw ) laser pulses at the same time .",
    "the dhwp is set at 45 degree to make the ccw pump horizontally polarized .",
    "the down - converted photons , i.e. , the signal and idler , were collimated by another two @xmath13 mm lenses , filtered by longpass filters ( lpfs ) and then coupled into single - mode fibers by two couplers ( smfc ) . finally , all the collected photons were sent to two superconducting nanowire single - photon detectors ( snspds ) , which were connected to a coincidence counter ( & ) . to test the polarization correlation",
    ", we inserted two sets of polarizers ( hwp+pbs ) before smfcs . to carry out quantum state tomography , we replaced the combination of hwp+pbs with that of hwp+qwp+pbs . since the snspds were polarization dependent , the photons input into the snspd were adjusted by fiber - polarization controllers ( not shown ) .",
    "the overall efficiency was estimated as 0.10 , including the detectors average efficiency of 0.69 , the smfcs average collection efficiency of 0.23 and the whole optics transmission efficiency of 0.64 .",
    ", width=11 ]    in this sagnac interferometer configuration , the pump beam is split into two , the clockwise ( cw ) pump and the counterclockwise ( ccw ) pump .",
    "both the cw and ccw pump beams are in opposite directions , but follow the same path , therefore this scheme is robust against the optical path changes and can keep phase ultra stable .",
    "another important feature of this configuration is that the temporal walk - off between the signal ( with higher group velocity ) and idler ( with lower group velocity ) can be automatically cancelled out , since the signal ( idler ) generated by cw pump propagates along with the signal ( idler ) generated by the ccw pump .",
    "a fine alignment of the sagnac loop is not easy .",
    "therefore , we make a mathematical simulation @xcite to simulate the beam propagations in a triangle shape sagnac - loop . from this simulation",
    ", we can learn that the output beams are always in parallel , but never cross . in order to achieve a completely collinear configuration for both the cw and ccw pump beams",
    ", the residual pump beams must overlap with the input laser .",
    "our superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspds ) are fabricated with 5 - 9 nm thick and 80 - 100 nm wide niobium nitride ( nbn ) or niobium titanium nitride ( nbtin ) meander nanowires on thermally oxidized silicon substrates @xcite .",
    "the nanowire covers an area of 15 @xmath15 m @xmath18 15 @xmath15 m .",
    "the snspds are installed in a gifford - mcmahon cryocooler system and are cooled to 2.1 kelvin .",
    "the maximum system detection efficiency ( sde ) is 79% with a dark count rate ( dcr ) of 2 kcps .",
    "the measured timing jitter and dead time ( recovery time ) were 68 ps @xcite and 40 ns @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the sdes of the two snspds were set at 70 % and 68% , corresponding to dcrs of less than 1 kcps . in our previous experiment , we achieved coincidence counts of 400 kcps ( 1.17 mcps ) at a pump power of 100 mw ( 400 mw ) with our ppktp crystal and snspds @xcite .",
    "the output state of this scheme is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the relative phase between the two paths in the cw and ccw directions , and @xmath21 is the ratio of the two pumps @xcite . by rotating the angle of qwp and hwp , we change @xmath20 and @xmath21 . by slightly moving the position of ppktp , we can finely adjust the relative phase @xmath20 by changing the gouy phase @xcite .",
    "we can easily exchange the state between @xmath22 and @xmath23 by rotating the angle of qwp and hwp .",
