    "supersymmetry ( susy ) offers the possibility of solving a number of theoretical problems of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "thus the cancelations implied by the bose - fermi symmetry resolves the gauge hierarchy problem , allowing one to consider models at energies all the way up to the gut or planck scale .",
    "further , using the susy sm particle spectrum with one pair of higgs doublets .",
    "( pairs of higgs doublets are needed on theoretical grounds to cancel anomalies and on phenomenological grounds to give rise to both u and d quark masses ) the renormalization group equations ( rge ) show that grand unification of the sm gauge coupling constants occurs at @xmath11 gev opening up the possibility of susy gut models . however",
    ", none of this can actually occur unless a natural way of spontaneously breaking susy occurs , and this very difficult to do with global supersymmetry .",
    "the problem was resolved by promoting supersymmetry to a gauge symmetry , supergravity ( sugra)@xcite , where spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry can easily occur .",
    "one can then build sugra gut models @xcite with gravity playing a key role in the construction .",
    "a positive consequence of this promotion was that the rge then show that the breaking of supersymmetry at the gut scale naturally leads to the required @xmath12 breaking at the electroweak scale , thus incorporating all the successes of the sm , without any prior assumptions of negative ( mass)@xmath13 terms .    in spite of the theoretical successes of sugra guts",
    ", there has been no experimental evidence for its validity except for the verification of grand unification ( which has in fact withstood the test of time for over a decade ) .",
    "however , one expects susy particles to be copiously produced at the lhc .",
    "further , models with r parity invariance predict the lightest neutralino @xmath14 to be a candidate for the astronomically observed dark matter ( dm ) and models exist  @xcite consistent with the amount of dark matter observed by wmap  @xcite , and being searched for in the milky way by dark matter detectors .",
    "thus it is possible to build models that both cover the entire energy range from the electroweak scale to the gut scale and go back in time to @xmath15 seconds after the big bang when the current relic dark matter was created .",
    "the question then arises can we verify if the dark matter particles in the galaxy is the neutralino expected to be produced at the lhc ? in principle this is doable . thus assuming the dm detectors eventually detect the dark matter particle",
    ", they will measure the mass and cross sections , and these can be compared with those measured at the lhc .",
    "however , this may take a long time to achieve . more immediately",
    ", can we look for a signal at the lhc that is reasonably direct consequence of the assumption that the neutralino is the astronomical dm particle and in this way experimentally unify particle phenomena with early universe cosmology ? to investigate this question it is necessary to choose a specific susy model , and for simplicity we consider here the minimal msugra ( though a similar analysis could be done for a wide range of other sugra models ) .",
    "= 10.6cm=7.0 cm",
    "the msugra model depends on four soft breaking parameters and one sign .",
    "these are ; @xmath10 ( the universal gaugino soft breaking mass at @xmath16 ) ; @xmath17 ( the universal scalar soft breaking mass at @xmath16 ) ; @xmath7 ( the universal cubic soft breaking mass at @xmath16 ) ; @xmath18 at the electroweak scale ( where @xmath19 gives rise to u quark masses and @xmath20 to d quark masses ) ; and the sign of @xmath21 parameter ( where @xmath21 appears in the quadratic part of the superpotential @xmath22 ) .",
    "current experimental data significantly constrains these parameters .",
    "the main accelerator constraints are : the higgs mass @xmath23 gev@xcite ; the lightest chargino mass @xmath24 gev ; the @xmath25 branching ratio 2.2 @xmath26  @xcite ; and the muon g-2 anomaly  @xcite which now deviates from the sm prediction by 3.4 @xmath27 .",
    "the astronomical constraint is the wmap determination of the amount of dark matter and we use here a 2 @xmath27 range  @xcite : @xmath28 the wmap constraint limits the parameter space to three main regions arising from the diagrams of fig.1 .",
    "( 1 ) the stau - neutralino ( @xmath29 ) coannihilation region . here",
    "@xmath17 is small and @xmath30 tev .",
    "( 2)the focus region where the neutralino has a large higgsino component .",
    "here @xmath10 is small and @xmath31 tev .",
    "( 3 ) the funnel region where annihilation proceeds through heavy higgs bosons which have become relatively light . here",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath10 are large .",
    "= 4.5 cm    ( in addition there is a small bulk region ) note that a key element in the coannihilation region is the boltzman factor from the annihilation in the early universe at @xmath32 20 gev : exp@xmath33}$ ] where @xmath34 .",
    "thus significant coannihilation occurs provided @xmath35 20 gev .",
    "the accelerator constraints further restrict the parameter space and if the muon g-2 anomaly maintains , @xmath36 is prefereed and there remains mainly the coannihilation region .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.2 which shows the allowed narrow coannihilation band ( for the case @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath36 ) where @xmath39 gev and @xmath40 gev .",
    "( there is a small focus region for small @xmath10 and @xmath41 tev since the @xmath42 constraint ceases to opperate at @xmath41 tev . )",
    "the coannihilation band is narrow ( @xmath43 gev ) due to the boltzman factor in fig.1 , the range in @xmath4 corresponding to the allowed wmap range for @xmath44 .",
    "the dashed verticle lines are possible higgs masses .",
    "one may ask two questions ; ( 1 ) can such a small stau - neutralino mass difference ( 5 - 15 gev ) arise in msugra , i.e. one would naturally expect these susy particles to be hundreds of gev apart and ( 2 ) can such a small mass difference be measured at the lhc ? if the answers to both these questions are affirmative , the observation of such a small mass difference would be a strong indication that the neutralino is the astronomical dm particle since it is the cosmological constraint on the amount of dm that forces the near mass degeneracy with the stau , and it is the accelerator constraints that suggests that the coannihilation region is the allowed region .",
    "at the gut scale @xmath10 governs the gaugino masses , while @xmath17 the slepton masses .",
    "thus , at @xmath16 one would not expect any degeneracies between the two classes of particles .",
    "however , at the electroweak scale the rge can modify this result . to see analytically this possibility ,",
    "consider the lightest selectron @xmath45 which at the electroweak scale has mass @xmath46 while the @xmath14 has mass    @xmath47    the numerical accident that the coefficients of @xmath48 is nearly the same for both cases allows a near degeneracy .",
    "thus for @xmath49 , the @xmath45 and @xmath14 become degenerate at @xmath10=(370 - 400 ) gev . for larger",
    "@xmath10 , the near degeneracy is maintained by increasing @xmath17 , so that one can get the narrow corridor in the @xmath17-@xmath10 plane seen in fig.2 . actually",
    "the case of the stau @xmath50 is more complicated since the large t - quark mass causes left - right mixing in the stau mass matrix and results in the @xmath50 being the lightest slepton ( not the selectron ) .",
    "however , a result similar to eqs .",
    "( 1,2 ) occurs , with a @xmath29 coannihilation corridor resulting .",
    "we note that the results of eqs.(1,2 ) depend only on the u(1 ) gauge group and so coannihilation can occur even if there were non - universal scalar mass soft - breaking or non - universal gaugino mass soft breaking at @xmath16 . thus , coannihilation can occur in a wide class of sugra models , and is not just a feature of msugra .",
    "at the lhc , the major susy production processes are gluinos ( @xmath51 ) and squarks ( @xmath52 ) e.g. , @xmath53",
    ". these then decay into lighter susy particles and fig.3 shows a major decay scheme .",
    "the final states involve two @xmath14 giving rise to missing transverse energy @xmath54 ) and four @xmath55 s , two from the @xmath56 and two from the @xmath52 decay chain for the example of fig 3 . in the coannihilation region ,",
    "two of the taus are high energy (  hard \" taus ) coming from the @xmath57 decay ( since @xmath58 ) while two are low energy (  soft \" taus ) coming from the @xmath59 decay since @xmath4 is small .",
    "the signal is thus @xmath60 jets + @xmath55 s , which should be observable at the lhc detectors .",
    "= 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm    as seen above we expect two pairs of taus , each pair containing one soft and one hard tau from each @xmath61 decay . since @xmath61 is neutral , each pair should be of opposite sign(while sm and susy backgrounds , jets faking taus will have equal number of like sign as opposite sign events ) .",
    "thus one can suppress backgrounds statistically by considering the number of oppsite sign events @xmath62 minus the like sign events @xmath63 .",
    "the four @xmath55 final state has the smallest background but the acceptance and efficiency for reconstructing all four taus is low .",
    "thus to implement the above ideas we consider here the three @xmath55 final state of which two are hard and one is soft .",
    "( the two @xmath55 final state with higher acceptance but larger backgrounds was discussed in @xcite , and an analysis of the coannhilation signal at the ilc was given in @xcite .",
    "we label three taus by their transverse energies with @xmath64 and form the pairs 13 and 23 . for signal events one of the two pairs should be coming from a @xmath61 decay and have opposite sign(os ) while the other is not correlated .",
    "there are two measurables that can be formed . the number @xmath65 and the mass of the pair @xmath66 . to simulate the data we use isajet 7.64 @xcite and pgs detector simulator @xcite .",
    "events are chosen with @xmath2 and 1 jet and three taus with visible momenta @xmath67 gev , @xmath67 gev , @xmath68 gev .",
    "we assume here that it is possible to reconstruct taus with @xmath69 as low as 20 gev .",
    "standard model background is reduced by requiring @xmath70 gev , @xmath71 gev with tevatron results , @xmath72 gev .",
    "we also assume rate of a jet faking a @xmath55 ( @xmath73 ) to be @xmath74 ( with a 20% error in @xmath73 ) consistent with tevatron results .",
    "fig 4 . shows the number of events as a function of the @xmath3 mass for gluino mass @xmath75 gev and @xmath76 gev and 20 gev .",
    "one sees that the difference @xmath77 cancels out as expected for @xmath3 mass @xmath78100 gev ( consistent with the fact that the signal events are expected to lie below 100 gev ) .",
    "5 shows the behavior of @xmath79 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the central black line is for the assumed 1% .",
    "rate for jets faking a @xmath55 , the shaded region around it is for a 20% uncertainty in @xmath73 .",
    "one sees that provided this uncertainty is not large , it produces only a small effect .",
    "= 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm    figs 4 and 5 show two important features .",
    "first , @xmath79 increases with @xmath4(since the @xmath55 acceptance increases ) and @xmath79 decreases with @xmath5(since the production cross section of gluinos and squarks decrease with @xmath5 ) .",
    "second , from fig.4 one sees that @xmath79 forms a peaked distribution @xcite .",
    "the ditau peak position @xmath80 increases with both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this allows us to use the two measurables @xmath79 and @xmath81 to determine both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "fig.6 shows this determination for the benchmark case of @xmath4=9 gev , @xmath5=850 gev , @xmath7=0 and @xmath82=40 .",
    "plotted there are constant values of @xmath79 and constant values of @xmath81 in the @xmath83 plane which exhibit the above dependance of these quantities on @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "with luminosity of 30 fb@xmath9 one determines @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the following accuracy : @xmath84 fig .",
    "7 shows how the accuracy of the measurement changes with luminosity .",
    "one sees that even with 10 fb@xmath9 ( which should be available at the lhc after about two years running)one could determine @xmath4 to within 22% , which should be sufficient to know whether one is in the sugra coannihilation region .",
    "we have examined here the question of how one might show that the @xmath14 particle produced at the lhc is the astronomically observed dark matter .",
    "if @xmath4 , the stau - neutralino mass difference lies in the coannihilation region of the sugra @xmath17-@xmath10 plane where @xmath39 gev , this would be strong indication that the neutralino is the dark matter particle as otherwise the mass difference would not naturally be so small .",
    "we saw how it was possible to measure such a small mass difference at the lhc for the msugra model using a signal of @xmath2 + 1 jet+@xmath1 , and simultaneously determine the gluino mass @xmath6 , provided it is possible at the lhc to reconstruct taus with @xmath69 as low as 20 gev . with 30 fb@xmath9 one could then determine @xmath4 with 15% accuracy and @xmath5 with 6% , at our benchmark point of @xmath4=9 gev , @xmath5=850 gev , @xmath37 , and @xmath7=0 .",
    "even with only 10fb@xmath9 one would determine @xmath4 to within 25% accuracy , sufficient to learn whether the signal is in the coannihilation region .",
    "while the analysis done here was within the framework of msugra , similar analyses can be done for other sugra models provided the production of neutralinos is not suppressed .",
    "however , the determination of @xmath5 does depend on the msugra universality of the gaugino masses at @xmath16 to relate @xmath85 to @xmath5",
    ". thus a model independent method of determining @xmath5 would allow one to to test the question of gaugino universality .",
    "however , it may not be easy to directly measure @xmath5 at the lhc for high @xmath82 in the coannihilation region due to the large number of low energy taus , and the ilc would require a very high energy option to see the gluino .    as mentioned above , one can also measure @xmath4 using the signal @xmath2 + 2 jets+2@xmath55 @xcite .",
    "this signal has higher acceptance but larger backgrounds .",
    "there , with 10 fb@xmath9 one finds that one can measure @xmath4 with 18% error at the benchmark point assuming a separate measurement of @xmath5 with 5% error has been made . while we have fixed our benchmark point at @xmath75 gev(i.e .",
    "@xmath86360 gev ) , higher gluino mass would require more luminosity to see the signal .",
    "one finds that with 100 fb@xmath9 one can probe @xmath10 at the lhc up to @xmath87 gev ( i.e. , @xmath6 up to @xmath88 tev ) .",
    "finally , it is interesting to compare with possible measurements of @xmath4 at the ilc . if we implement a very forward calorimeter to reduce the two @xmath89 background , @xmath4 can be determined with 10% error at the benchmark point @xcite .",
    "thus in the coannihilation region , the determination of @xmath4 at the lhc is not significantly worse than at the ilc .",
