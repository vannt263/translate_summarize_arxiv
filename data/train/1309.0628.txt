    "adiabatic elimination is a standard tool for the quantum optician @xcite .",
    "it is applied both to rate equations and amplitude equations . in its textbook presentation ,",
    "the argument is that , because of wide separation of scales , the population or amplitude of a ",
    "fast \" state will not change appreciably from the point of view of a  slow \" state , if the initial state is mostly slow .",
    "the approximation then consists on setting the corresponding derivative to zero , solving for the fast variable , and introducing this solution in the rest of equations , thus obtaining an effective dynamics .",
    "given its widespread use , it natural that other presentations of the approximation appear .",
    "of particular relevance is that achieved as the _",
    "static _ approximation in laplace space , whereby an unknown energy term is discarded in a resolvent or green function corresponding only to the fast sector .",
    "this also provides us with a suggestion for improving on the adiabatic approximation , as has been pointed out by brion et al .",
    "@xcite , for instance .",
    "in fact , the idea of separation of scales leading to approximations and effective dynamics is to be found in all areas of physics . in atomic and molecular physics",
    "one finds the born  oppenheimer approximation . in nuclear physics improvements on the shell model have led to effective interactions and operators to account for phenomena such as electric quadrupole moments .    yet again , effective lagrangians are a staple in nonperturbative analyses of field theories ( see for instance chapter 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "one approach to understanding these effective lagrangians consists on carrying out the functional integral for the irrelevant degrees of freedom , thus producing a ( generally non - local ) effective lagrangian for the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "naturally enough , quite some skill is required to identify the proper degrees of freedom that need integrating out , and a number of techniques have been developed to this end .",
    "additionally one normally needs to perform some approximations .",
    "one such combination of integrating out and approximation is again given by the _",
    "static approximation _ , which is the first term of an expansion of a non - local propagator around a particular pole .",
    "this integration of irrelevant degrees of freedom and further approximation pertains to the use of field theory both for high energy and for condensed matter physics , differing in the symmetries and scales to be stressed .",
    "the generality of this concept of separation of scales means that essentially the same technique has been often developed independently in different contexts .",
    "although we most definitely do not attempt a survey of each method in all areas , we do attempt to provide some pointers to the multiple sources of a particular perturbation procedure to which adiabatic elimination affiliates .    because indeed adiabatic elimination in its textbook presentation can be understood as the first term in a systematic perturbative expansion , as we will show .",
    "even more , we will show that it is an specific presentation of perturbation theory that is widespread in physics .",
    "the specifity , due to wide energy separations , will allow us furthermore a statement on convergence .",
    "in this manner we will provide a response to the questions posed recently in , for example , @xcite and @xcite : here the somewhat handwaving argument of standard adiabatic elimination is made precise , by identifying a small parameter that controls the precision of the approximation ; adiabatic elimination forms part of a set of well - defined , consistent and convergent systematic approximations ; the issues with the normalisation of the wave function and , in particular , with the computation of the population of the eliminated states are settled for each approximation ; and , in appendix , we will detail the dependence on the interaction picture used to set up adiabatic elimination .    to do this we will first consider directly the well - known example of the @xmath0 system , in which we will identify the relevant small parameter .",
    "we will proceed by recognising the system as a singular perturbation problem , which will be tackled with the invariant manifold formalism , the first term of the corresponding expansion being adiabatic elimination itself .",
    "we will recognise that in quantum mechanical systems this corresponds to linear embedding , and rewrite the method accordingly .    in the next section",
    "we extend the findings for the @xmath0 system to a general setting , and connect the results with the similarity formalism for perturbation theory that has been frequently rediscovered in different areas of physics .",
    "the third section proposes two systematic approximation schemes , and proves the existence of a solution .",
    "these schemes are illustrated in the next section by applying them again to the @xmath0 system .",
    "section [ sec : hermapprox ] is devoted to the issue of normalisation and hermiticity .",
    "it also connects again with the similarity formalism and effective diagonalisation .",
    "we end by proposing some conclusions and ideas for future work .",
    "in order to compare results , we shall use the same notation as @xcite .",
    "thus , the dynamical system of interest is @xmath1 we are interested in the regime in which @xmath2 .",
    "the adiabatic elimination approximation consists of the argument that the @xmath3 component of the wave function will be approximately constant , and computed by solving for @xmath3 in the last equation after substituting @xmath4 .",
    "we shall first phrase the problem as a singular perturbation one , which will allow us to better understand the origin of adiabatic elimination . in order to do this ,",
    "let us introduce the variable @xmath5 , and define @xmath6 .",
    "the system is thus written as @xmath7 this rewriting gives a direct justification for adiabatic elimination , by means of the @xmath8 factor in front of @xmath9 .",
    "we can of course , go further .    for small @xmath8 ( and finite @xmath10 for @xmath11 ) , this is a singular perturbation problem : the problem , as stated , is a system with three differential equations , while for @xmath12 it is a system with just two differential equations .",
    "many methods have been developed for this kind of system @xcite : averaging , multiple scales , dynamical renormalization group @xcite ( for some applications of the dynamical renormalization group to quantum mechanics and quantum optics , see @xcite and @xcite ) . for our purposes we shall select the invariant manifold approach , which will be seen as a direct generalization of the standard adiabatic elimination process .    in the invariant manifold approach to singular perturbations",
    ", one determines among all possible manifolds invariant under the dynamics those that are perturbative . in our case , this is achieved by writing a submanifold of the three dimensional complex manifold in its explicit form @xmath13 , and demanding that it be invariant under the dynamics . denoting derivatives with respect to the variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 by subindices , the invariance condition reads @xmath16\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] once the perturbation solution @xmath17 has been determined , the effective evolution is @xmath18    the advantage of this method is that once a perturbative approximation has been determined for @xmath17 , the effective evolution will not present secular terms .",
    "the disadvantage is that the effective evolution has to be recomputed for different approximations .    in the case at hand ,",
    "the perturbative solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : invariantlambda ] ) has the form @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath20 and , for @xmath21 , @xmath22 the first term in the expansion , @xmath23 , corresponds exactly with that is termed adiabatic elimination , thus making clear in which way the adiabatic elimination approximation is a first term in a ( singular ) perturbative expansion , as desired from the outset .",
    "the invariant manifold approach is specially adequate for nonlinear dynamical systems , and it can be simplified in the case at hand : even though the embedding equation ( [ eq : invariantlambda ] ) is nonlinear , the perturbative solution is linear ( one way of seeing this is that the differential system is the characteristic system for the embedding partial differential equation ) .",
    "therefore , the effective evolution on the invariant manifold is also linear ; it is , however , not unitary .",
    "this comes about because the conserved quantity is actually the full norm @xmath24 , and not just @xmath25 .",
    "since the embedding is linear , we can rephrase it as @xmath26 @xmath27 is an operator from the two dimensional space spanned by @xmath28 and @xmath29 to the one dimensional space spanned by @xmath30 .",
    "the invariance condition reads now @xmath31 where @xmath32 given any @xmath27 solution of the invariance condition ( [ eq : invariblambda ] ) , a non hermitian effective hamiltonian is computed as @xmath33",
    "the presentation above inspires a more general , admittedly formal , theory .",
    "consider a hilbert space @xmath34 on which a hamiltonian acts , with clearly separate scales present ( in a sense to be made clear later ) .",
    "assume therefore that there is a subspace @xmath35 corresponding to the _ slow _ variables ( also called the model or valence space in nuclear physics , or the active space in atomic and molecular physics ) .",
    "the complementary space , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , is used to describe the _ fast _ variables .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written in block diagonal form , @xmath38 which corresponds to the direct sum structure @xmath39 as @xmath40 the embedding condition means the identification of manifolds invariant under the flow determined by the hamiltonian , @xmath41 with the specification that the invariant manifold is isomorphic ( unitarily equivalent ) to @xmath35 ( for finite dimensionality , of the same dimensionality ) .",
    "this can be achieved in an explicit form by means of operators @xmath42 , which obey the equation @xmath43 to prove the need for this condition , substitute @xmath44 in the evolution equation , and ask for consistency .    the effective evolution for @xmath14 is readily seen to be @xmath45 , thus suggesting the effective hamiltonian @xmath46 .",
    "this is in fact the equation for what has been called in the literature the reduced bloch wave operator or the _ model _ or _ wave _",
    "operator from nuclear physics @xcite ( see also section 2 of @xcite and appendix [ app : blochwave ] ) .",
    "we have obtained the equation directly from reduction by partitioning of schrdinger s time dependent equation , while the reduced wave operator is normally obtained from the eigenvalue equation applying the same partitioning , following the projector operator formalism of feshbach @xcite ( notice the reprinting of the latter as @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of our approach will come from it making visible the singular perturbation aspect of the equations in the adiabatic elimination case .",
    "an important aspect here is that in principle the embedding algebraic equation ( [ eq : bembedding ] ) has solutions that give the _ full _ spectrum of the total hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , if the slow and fast variables were decoupled , with no degeneracy , the trivial solution @xmath47 would be unique . as a consequence of this equation involving all eigenspaces of the full hamiltonian , it can lead in some circumstances to problems in its perturbative solution , related to the existence of so - called intruder states , for instance .",
    "alternatively , it is also related to the similarity transformation formalism , as follows . as is known ,",
    "similarity transformations are isospectral .",
    "we thus look for invertible operators @xmath48 such that @xmath49 and some additional conditions are also fulfilled .",
    "given such an operator @xmath48 , the effective hamiltonian in the slow or model space would be given by @xmath50 notice that @xmath51 need not be hermitian ; it is indeed hermitian if @xmath48 is unitary .",
    "a bonus of this approach is that effective operators @xmath52 acting on @xmath35 are constructed for each @xmath53 acting on the full hilbert space @xmath34 as @xmath54    this similarity transformation construction , without further restriction , would not be very informative ( for instance , it need not reflect an existing hierarchy of scales ) , and thus a number of additional conditions have been developed in the literature @xcite to best reflect the underlying physics .",
    "when van vleck first introduced this formalism in 1929 ( section 4 of @xcite ) he demanded unitarity of @xmath48 .",
    "this approach was reintroduced in relativistic quantum mechanics by foldy and wouthuysen @xcite , and in condensed matter physics some time later by schrieffer and wolff @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "if unitarity is not demanded , an immediate proposal is @xmath55 here we have a slight overload of notation : we have used @xmath27 as an operator acting on @xmath34 , taking into account that @xmath56 , which in turn implies @xmath57 ( since @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 inserting these in the decoupling condition ( [ eq : decoupling ] ) , we have @xmath60\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] thus proving that with this choice of @xmath48 the decoupling condition is precisely the embedding equation .    with this proposal , for a solution of the embedding equation",
    "we have an effective hamiltonian @xmath46 , which is generically not hermitian .",
    "this effective hamiltonian has been called the bloch hamiltonian in the literature @xcite .",
    "as stated above , the embedding equation is by itself very general , and can have multiple solutions . we want to study the specific case",
    "in which , physically , there is a wide separation of scales . for the @xmath0 system this pertained to the condition @xmath61 . in general",
    ", we will achieve separation of scales if our choice of subspaces ( equivalently of the @xmath62 projector ) is such that a ) @xmath63 is invertible as an operator on @xmath64 , b ) @xmath65 and c ) @xmath66 for operator norms .",
    "define a new time variable @xmath67 .",
    "the equations of motion are now @xmath68 in which the singular perturbation character is clearly visible .",
    "this suggests treating the embedding equation as determining either a perturbative expansion or a recurrence relation .",
    "if indeed @xmath63 is invertible as an operator on @xmath64 , the embedding condition ( [ eq : bembedding ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath69 where @xmath70 maps @xmath71 ( bounded operators from @xmath35 to @xmath64 ) to itself nonlinearly , as follows @xmath72 for any norm on @xmath71 we have the bound @xmath73 for the operator norm , we also have @xmath74 now , by plotting the functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , one readily sees that if @xmath53 is in the ball centered at the null operator with radius @xmath79 then @xmath80 also belongs to that ball .",
    "thus , by schauder s fixed point theorem , @xmath70 has a fixed point in the ball .",
    "let us now construct the recurrence @xmath81\\nonumber\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath82 , it will belong to the ball if @xmath83 ( which is the generic situation ) , and the recurrence will converge ( we have actually not excluded the possibility that there exist a fixed cycle  see however appendix [ app : nocycles ] ) .",
    "furthermore , writing @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a fixed constant , we can write the embedding equation as perturbative , where @xmath86 has perturbative weight @xmath8 : expand @xmath87 and insert in the embedding equation to obtain @xmath88 where in the last line @xmath21 .",
    "notice that , formally , @xmath89    we shall give the name _ perturbative adiabatic elimination expansion _ to the expansion ( [ eq : adiaelimexp ] ) with recurrence ( [ eq : adiaelimexprecurr ] ) .",
    "given this expansion to some order @xmath90 , we shall have the effective hamiltonian to the same order by substituting the approximation for @xmath27 in @xmath46 .",
    "notice that we have the expansion in a purely algebraic manner ; there is no need to impose consistency through the single pole approximation for the resolvent , as in @xcite , or , equivalently , in the taylor expansion proposed in @xcite .",
    "one must bear in mind that this is a particular perturbation expansion , particularly adapted to the problem at hand , that differs from other expansions present in the literature .",
    "see appendix [ app : seconperturb ] for another perturbative expansion , which is adequate even if our expansion parameter is not small .",
    "we can now identify the constructions of the previous section in the @xmath0 system previously introduced ; as one can see @xmath91 and @xmath63 is simply a number .",
    "to fourth order we have @xmath92 notice that at any order @xmath93 will generically have a term proportional to the operator @xmath94 and another proportional to @xmath95 , with no other possibility .",
    "to the same order we obtain @xmath96 this expression has been ordered in terms of the operators @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , with numerical coefficients in front ; again , these are the only possibilities .",
    "the non hermitian terms are due to @xmath99 .",
    "notice that some terms with physical significance are spread in more than one coefficient ; for instance , the stark shift has contributions from both @xmath100 $ ] and @xmath101 $ ] .",
    ", under a ) the exact hamiltonian ( continuous black line ) , b ) zeroth order effective hamiltonian ( dashed blue line ) and c ) fourth iteration of @xmath70 ( dotted red line ) .",
    "the parameters are @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , for direct comparison with @xcite.,width=192 ]    numerically it will be faster to use the recurrence relation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdaex ] we depict the evolution of the populations in the slow manifold for exact evolution , effective hamiltonian with @xmath105 , and effective hamiltonian constructed with @xmath106 . at the scale of the figure , the graphs constructed with @xmath107 and @xmath108 would be indistinguishable from the fourth iteration for those values of the parameters . notice",
    "that the hamiltonian @xmath109 is the usual adiabatically eliminated hamiltonian , and that @xmath110 is much more successful in tracking the envelope of the evolution . for the numerical values used , the non conservation of probability due to the nonhermiticity of @xmath110 is of order @xmath111 .",
    "as stated above , the nonhermiticity of bloch s hamiltonian @xmath112 is due to the part of the norm carried by @xmath113 .",
    "the norm conserved under the evolution with the full hamiltonian in @xmath34 is simply @xmath114 by construction , @xmath115 is positive , and one can define its square root @xmath116 then for any constant unitary @xmath117 from @xmath35 to itself we have that the norm of @xmath118 is conserved if @xmath14 evolves under the bloch hamiltonian @xmath119",
    ". i.e. @xmath120 from which one defines the family of hamiltonians @xmath121 which are indeed hermitian .",
    "this last statement can be proven in several ways .",
    "firstly , by construction : the flow under @xmath122 preserves the norm and the inner products .",
    "it is a continuous flow , so by wigner s theorem it is a unitary flow . the hamiltonians @xmath122 are the constant generators of the unitary flow , and thus hermitian . in finite dimensions we can also assert self - adjointness .",
    "a second proof is explicit .",
    "observe that @xmath123 since @xmath124 is hermitian , we will have proven hermiticity of @xmath122 if we prove hermiticity of @xmath125 , that is , of @xmath126 and if @xmath27 is a solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : bembedding ] ) we indeed have that @xmath127 which , given the hermiticity of @xmath128 and @xmath63 , is explicitly hermitian .",
    "notice that we have used eqn .",
    "( [ eq : bembedding ] ) in the second step .",
    "this proof of hermiticity relies on @xmath27 being an exact solution of ( [ eq : bembedding ] ) ; if @xmath129 were an approximation to the solution to a given order , then @xmath130 will be approximately hermitian , to the same order .",
    "however , the proof itself suggests that @xmath131= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + b_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\dag}b_{\\mathrm{a } } } } \\left ( \\omega + \\omega^{\\dag } b_{\\mathrm{a}}+ b_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\dag } \\omega + b_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\dag } \\delta b_{\\mathrm{a } } \\right)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + b_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\dag}b_{\\mathrm{a}}}}\\ ] ] is a always a hermitian approximation .    in particular , by using the successive approximations",
    "@xmath132 introduced in ( [ eq : brecurrence ] ) one can define successive hermitian approximations of the full hermitian effective hamiltonian as @xmath133\\,.\\ ] ]    , under a ) the exact hamiltonian ( continuous black line ) , b ) @xmath134 ( dotted red line ) and c ) @xmath135 with @xmath136 ( dashed green line ) .",
    "the parameters are @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , as before.,width=192 ]    as an example , in figure [ fig : lambdaherm ] we depict also the evolution with the hermitian hamiltonian , again for the @xmath0 system .",
    "observe that the central maximum is at one , and that norm is conserved .",
    "in the previous subsections we have emphasised the effective hamiltonian , be it exact or approximate , in the slow sector .",
    "however , the construction provides us also with information about the fast sector .",
    "look back to subsection [ ssec : similarity ] .",
    "there we defined @xmath137 as the effective hamiltonian in the slow space .",
    "we could similarly regard @xmath138 as the effective hamiltonian in the fast space .",
    "this is correct in that it provides us with the eigenvalues corresponding to the fast space : since we impose the condition @xmath139 , the similarity transformed @xmath140 is block upper triangular , and , since the eigenvalues of a block upper triangular matrix are the eigenvalues of its diagonal blocks , the fast eigenvalues are indeed those of @xmath141 .    using @xmath142 , with @xmath27 an exact solution of the embedding condition ( [ eq : bembedding ] ) , we have @xmath143 so that @xmath144 is the effective hamiltonian in the fast space .",
    "we now desire to have a hermitian effective hamiltonian in the fast sector . in order to do that ,",
    "let us first notice that , similarly to the computation in ( [ eq : computehermit ] ) , one can prove that @xmath145 which is explicitly hermitian , as long as @xmath27 is a solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : bembedding ] ) .",
    "define @xmath146 acting on @xmath64 ( for later computations it will prove useful to bear in mind that @xmath147 , and thus @xmath148 ) .",
    "we have proven that @xmath149 is similar to a block upper triangular matrix with hermitian diagonal blocks and bounded off - diagonal block .",
    "explicitly : the computations hitherto signify @xmath150 where @xmath151   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + b^{\\dag}b}}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ h_c^\\gamma&= & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + bb^{\\dag}}}\\left[\\delta- \\omega b^{\\dag}- b \\omega^{\\dag}+ b \\omega b^{\\dag}\\right ]   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + bb^{\\dag}}}\\,.\\nonumber\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that @xmath152 is the inverse of @xmath153 with @xmath154 and @xmath155 unitaries acting on @xmath35 and @xmath64 respectively , so that the left hand side of ( [ eq : vssimilarity ] ) is indeed a similarity transformation .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach to the problem is that we have approximations for @xmath156 and @xmath157 which are explicitly hermitian for each approximation of @xmath27 .",
    "so we have a block upper triangular matrix that is an approximation to the exact one for each approximation of @xmath27 solution of the embedding equation ( [ eq : bembedding ] ) , with hermitian diagonal blocks and bounded off - diagonal block .    in finite dimensions ,",
    "roth s theorem @xcite gives us a condition for this block upper triangular matrix to be in turn similar to the block diagonal matrix with the same diagonal blocks .",
    "for infinite dimensions , if we can guarantee self - adjointness and not just hermiticity of the diagonal blocks , we can make use of the analogous result by rosenblum @xcite .    the simple result , from our point of view , is that if for a given @xmath27 the spectra of @xmath158 and @xmath159 are disjoint , then a similarity transformation exists that transforms the block upper triangular matrix into the corresponding block diagonal one .",
    "this similarity transform is given by @xmath160 , solution of the sylvester equation @xmath161 through @xmath162    the crucial point for us at this juncture is to note that the existence of the diagonalising transformation ( that must necessarily be unitary and not just by similarity ) is guaranteed if the spectra of @xmath158 and @xmath159 are disjoint ; this is intuitively the case if indeed @xmath128 and @xmath94 are much smaller than @xmath63 in the sense above .",
    "actually , there is a much faster explicit route : notice that @xmath163 if @xmath27 is a solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : bembedding ] ) .",
    "define @xmath164 then @xmath165 and we have proved that , for @xmath27 solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : bembedding ] ) , @xmath166    there is a subtlety to be pointed out for the sake of the unwary : the fact that @xmath48 constructed as in definition ( [ eq : finalx ] ) gives the same diagonalization as @xmath167 does not mean that they are the same .",
    "rather , it means that @xmath168 commutes with @xmath149 .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath48 given here was first presented in @xcite .",
    "the alternative expression @xmath169\\ ] ] has been computed independently by several authors ( additional to @xcite , see also @xcite , more directly adapted to the presentation of schrieffer and wolff @xcite ) .    in the context of quantum optics ,",
    "the matrix @xmath48 provides us with the dressing of the subspaces : @xmath170 is the projector onto the low lying sector . in other words",
    ", @xmath48 intertwines the projector onto the unperturbed low lying states and the projector onto the fully non - perturbative low lying states , @xmath171",
    ".    notice that given any @xmath27 ( solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : bembedding ] ) or not ) , @xmath48 is unitary , and it fully determines a projector @xmath172 .",
    "this means that if we have an approximate solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : bembedding ] ) we have an approximation to the projector onto the space of low lying states .",
    "similarly , we will also have an approximation for the effective hamiltonian , @xmath156 , hermitian by construction .    in the case of interest , where two subspaces are tentatively identified as corresponding to widely separated time scales ,",
    "this approximation can be given by truncating at a given order the perturbative adiabatic elimination expansion , or , alternatively , by the recurrence relation .",
    "we have identified the adiabatic elimination approximation as the first member of sets of systematic approximations , built algebraically in a well defined way .",
    "in fact , we have made explicit the connection between adiabatic elimination and well established perturbation methods . as a new result we have the proof of convergence of the procedure , and of existence of the diagonalisation matrix .",

    "we have shown by example the simplicity and effectiveness of the expansions in the @xmath0 system .    in the @xmath0 system itself",
    "we have produced explicit formulae for the effective hamiltonian ; in the text itself we have mentioned that only two types of terms ever appear ( @xmath173 and @xmath174 for the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian ) .",
    "we expect that this kind of result will generally be available in other systems , and we suggest that one of the advantages of the method put forward here is that it will facilitate the identification of such general structures .",
    "we have not made explicit the connection between our algebraic procedures and the resolvent techniques ; we leave this for future work .",
    "we also postpone the application of these expansions to improve on the rotating wave approximation , which is work in progress .",

    "this method would be preferable if @xmath63 were not so different from @xmath219 ; if there is the wide separation between @xmath128 and @xmath63 asked for in the text , this method provides a resummation of the perturbative adiabatic elimination expansion .",
    "there is an appealing argument to discard the possibility of a two cycle for the @xmath70 transformation .",

    "the similarity transformation approach is very useful in that it has direct application to mixed states .",
