    "the universality of the lorentz localization transition stems from an underlying percolation transition  @xcite .",

    "the width of these channels become vanishingly small and reduce to straight lines only in the limit @xmath61 . however , in practice , when @xmath46 the channels become so narrow that we do not observe a single obstacle - crossing event in our simulations , see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a inset .",
    "the particles merely penetrate the interaction discs over a minute distance of the order of @xmath62 before being strongly repelled .",

    "<S> combining experiments and theory , we address the dynamics of self - propelled particles in crowded environments . </S>",
    "<S> we first demonstrate that active colloids propelling at constant speed through random lattices of repelling obstacles undergo a smooth transition from diffusive to localized dynamics upon increasing the obstacle density . </S>",
    "<S> we then elucidate the nature of the localization transition by performing extensive simulations constructed from a detailed analysis of the colloid - obstacle interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we evidence that repulsion at a distance and hard - core interactions both contribute to slowing down the long - time diffusion of the colloids . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the localization transition stems solely from excluded - volume interactions and occurs at the void - percolation threshold . within this critical scenario , </S>",
    "<S> equivalent to that of the random lorentz gas , genuine asymptotic subdiffusion is found only at the critical density where the motile particles explore a fractal maze . </S>"
