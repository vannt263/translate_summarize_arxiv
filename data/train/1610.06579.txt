    "refractory sub - m particles or dust grains are an integral component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies .",
    "interstellar dust consists of silicate and carbonaceous grains with a mass fraction of less than 1% of the gas mass .",
    "nevertheless , these dust grains influence the physics and chemistry of the ism in multiple ways @xcite .",
    "one of the most important effects of interstellar grains is their absorption of the ultraviolet ( uv ) interstellar radiation field .",
    "at least 30% of the stellar light at uv wavelengths is reprocessed by grains and re - emitted in the infrared @xcite . a small fraction of the absorbed energy is returned to the ism through photoelectric emission , which is the dominant heating source of the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "dust also affects the thermal balance of the ism by locking away important coolants such as c@xmath0 and si@xmath0 @xcite and by causing the freeze - out of co in the dense phase @xcite .",
    "grains have a two - fold role in astrochemistry , namely shielding the molecules from the dissociating uv photons and providing the surfaces for the formation of complex organic molecules and h@xmath1 molecules , the main constituent of molecular clouds .",
    "the size distribution and chemical composition are the key dust properties determining grain interactions with matter and radiation .",
    "numerical simulations of galactic evolution usually assume that interstellar dust constitutes a fixed fraction of the metals and that its properties have the average characteristics of dust in the local galaxy ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , there is strong observational evidence that grain properties depend on the local environment as indicated by variations of interstellar element depletion @xcite , extinction curves @xcite , dust - to - gas ratios @xcite , opacities @xcite , and spectral characteristics @xcite , among many others ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "these observations demonstrate that both the composition and the size distribution of grains are not constant even in our nearest environment .",
    "the observed changes in dust properties are attributed to grain evolution driven by local conditions in the ism . in a simplified way",
    ", the ism can be described by a three - phase model proposed by @xcite , which consists of cold clouds ( cold neutral medium , cnm ) , surrounded by the warm neutral envelopes ( warm neutral medium , wnm ) and warm ionised matter ( wim ) ; the hot ionised medium ( him ) fills most of the volume .",
    "additionally , molecular clouds represent dense regions of the ism that are opaque to uv radiation and where star formation takes place . due to their coupling to the interstellar gas",
    ", interstellar grains follow the cycle of matter between the ism phases , which is regulated by the formation of molecular clouds and their disruption by stellar feedback processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    during their time in the warm medium",
    ", grains are altered and partially or completely destroyed by a number of processes such as vaporisation in grain - grain collisions and erosion by ion sputtering in interstellar shocks , and by uv irradiation by the interstellar radiation field @xcite . in clouds",
    ", grains are protected from uv irradiation and sputtering in shocks , and the dust mass can grow by accretion of gas - phase species @xcite .",
    "coagulation becomes the dominant outcome of grain - grain collisions in dense clouds , resulting in the removal of small grains and the build - up of large grains @xcite .",
    "dust abundances in the interstellar gas are therefore closely related to the evolution of the ism , in particular to its structure and the mass transfer between the phases . to explain the large differences in element depletion between the wnm and cnm @xcite , simple models of dust evolution based on two- and three - phase ism models with various schemes for phase transitions were proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the relative depletion in the cnm and wnm depend on the adopted scheme of the phase transition : whether gas from the wnm is transferred directly to molecular clouds or through the cnm .",
    "moreover , the observed scatter in the dust - to - gas ratio in spiral galaxies can also be explained by the cycling of matter in the multi - phase ism , with the timescales of the transitions determining the amplitude of the dust - to - gas ratio variations @xcite .",
    "the residence times that the grains spend in the different ism phases are important quantities that regulate the processing of the grains in these environments .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the grain size distribution is very sensitive to the residence times in the ism phases : grain shattering by turbulence can overproduce the number of small grains in the wim and limit the sizes of large grains in the wnm .",
    "coagulation dominating in dense cloud cores can completely remove small grains when the residence time exceeds @xmath6  myr .",
    "the residence times in the multi - phase ism also determine the exposure of interstellar grains to uv radiation and the susceptibility to collisions with ions .",
    "information on the exposure duration is useful to set up realistic conditions for laboratory experiments on dust analogues simulating the formation and evolution of organic refractory matter @xcite .",
    "moreover , some stardust grains present in the solar system during its formation process can be identified in meteorites and studied in the laboratory .",
    "analysis of the surfaces of these grains provides insights into their processing in the ism and can be done more accurately if the exposure times are known @xcite .",
    "models of interstellar dust typically use a highly idealised description of the ism phases , where each phase is represented by a single characteristic temperature and density .",
    "recent , more realistic hydrodynamical simulations of the ism @xcite present an opportunity to move away from this simplified picture .",
    "they allow us to probe dust evolution in the context of an inhomogeneous ism under a wide range of physical conditions and a complex evolutionary history .",
    "for example , in such simulations molecular clouds form dynamically out of the diffuse phase and get destroyed by stellar feedback .",
    "the physical conditions within the molecular cloud are then time - dependent , and there will be a distribution of molecular cloud lifetimes rather than a single unique value .    in this paper , we investigate the lifecycle of interstellar grains in the multi - phase ism with simulations from the silcc ( simulating the lifecycle of molecular clouds ) project @xcite .",
    "the silcc simulations include a time - dependent chemical network and therefore provide detailed descriptions of the relevant ism structure and phases .",
    "we present a pilot study in which we use lagrangian tracer particles to measure residence times in and transition rates between the different ism phases in local galactic - scale simulations of a supernova - driven ism under solar neighbourhood conditions .",
    "details of our numerical scheme and the simulation setup are given in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "we describe the evolution of the simulations in section  [ sec : adv ] and of individual tracer particle trajectories in section  [ sec : traj ] .",
    "we then discuss how the tracer particles sample the multi - phase ism ( section  [ sec : sam ] ) and present our measurements of mass circulation and transition rates between the phases ( section  [ sec : trans ] ) , residence times within the phases ( section  [ sec : res ] ) and shielding from uv radiation ( section  [ sec : shield ] ) .",
    "we point out some caveats in section  [ sec : cav ] and conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we present kpc - scale stratified box simulations run with the adaptive mesh refinement code ` flash `  4 @xcite with a stable , positivity - preserving magnetohydrodynamics solver @xcite and a method based on a barnes - hut tree @xcite to incorporate self - gravity ( r.  wnsch et al . in prep . ) .",
    "our simulation box has dimensions @xmath7kpc@xmath8kpc@xmath9kpc and a maximum grid resolution of @xmath10pc .",
    "we apply periodic boundary conditions in the plane of the disc ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions ) and outflow boundary conditions in the vertical ( @xmath13 ) direction , so that gas can leave but not enter the simulation box .",
    "the simulation domain has lower heights above and below the disc plane than previous silcc simulations @xcite , but otherwise the code and setup are identical .",
    "we impose an external potential to model the gravitational force of a stellar disc on the gas .",
    "we choose an isothermal sheet potential with parameters that fit solar neighbourhood values , namely a stellar surface density @xmath14m@xmath15pc@xmath16 and a vertical scale height @xmath17pc .",
    "we set up the gas with a gaussian distribution in @xmath13-direction , with a scale height of @xmath18pc , and a gas surface density @xmath19m@xmath15pc@xmath16 .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper do not include magnetic fields . for more information on the initial conditions and simulation setup",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use a time - dependent chemical network @xcite that follows the abundances of free electrons , h@xmath20 , h , h@xmath21 , c@xmath20 , o and co. we employ the ` treecol ` algorithm ( @xcite , r.  wnsch et al . in prep . ) to take into account dust shielding and molecular self - shielding . in the warm and cold gas ,",
    "the primary cooling processes are lyman-@xmath22 cooling , h@xmath21 ro - vibrational line cooling , fine - structure emission from c@xmath20 and o , and rotational emission from co @xcite . in hot gas , electronic excitation of helium and of partially ionised metals",
    "must also be taken into account , which is done using the @xcite cooling rates assuming collisional ionisation equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , we include diffuse heating from the photoelectric effect , cosmic rays and x - rays following the prescriptions of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "more information on the chemical network and the various heating and cooling processes can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for our gas surface density the kennicutt - schmidt relation @xcite yields a star formation rate surface density @xmath23m@xmath15yr@xmath24kpc@xmath16 . assuming one supernova event per @xmath25m@xmath26 in stars , this corresponds to a supernova rate surface density @xmath27myr@xmath24kpc@xmath16 , or 15 supernova explosions per myr in our simulation volume .",
    "we inject a thermal energy @xmath28erg with each such explosion at this constant rate .",
    "we consider three different ways to position the sites of the supernova explosions ( see @xcite for a detailed justification ) .",
    "for random driving , we distribute the explosion sites according to a probability distribution that is uniform in the @xmath11-@xmath12 plane and gaussian in @xmath13 direction with a scale height of @xmath29pc @xcite . for peak",
    "driving , supernovae always explode at the current location of the maximum density peak . for mixed",
    "driving , 50% of all supernovae are randomly distributed and 50% explode at density peaks .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details on the implementation of supernova positioning and energy injection and to @xcite and @xcite for a systematic investigation of the effects of supernova positioning and supernova rates on the chemical and dynamical properties of the resulting ism , respectively . in their notation , our simulations with",
    "random , mixed and peak driving correspond to the runs s10-ks - rand , s10-ks - mix and s10-ks - peak , respectively .",
    "we have run all three simulations for a duration of @xmath30myr .",
    "our simulations represent an idealisation of star formation feedback in the ism . because we do not model the formation of star clusters self - consistently ( but see @xcite ) , we systematically explore how the location of supernova explosions affects the ism .",
    "peak driving is motivated by the idea that star formation happens in the densest regions of the ism .",
    "random driving takes the finite time between the formation of stars and their explosions as supernovae as well as the existence of field and runaway ob stars into account , which leads to the expectation that a large fraction of supernovae are located in underdense gas at random positions .",
    "mixed driving is a compromise between the two extremes .",
    "the ism is most realistic for simulations with random and mixed driving is terms of mass fractions and volume - filling fractions of the different ism phases , while with peak driving the formation of h@xmath1 and the hot phase is suppressed @xcite .",
    "although some dynamical quantities like velocity dispersions and outflow rates converge , the simulations do not reach a steady state because they do not include a self - consistent treatment of star formation and supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "they should be understood as controlled numerical experiments that allow us to study the properties of interstellar dust in the multi - phase ism produced by the different forms of supernova driving .    at the beginning of each simulation , we distribute @xmath31 tracer particles over the simulation volume such that the local tracer particle number density is proportional to the local gas density .",
    "the equation of motion for the tracer particles is integrated using heun s method .",
    "we interpolate the data stored on the grid ( gas density and temperature , chemical abundances , and the local radiation field ) to the location of the particle within the grid tri - linearly and save it together with the particle positions and velocities to a file every 10kyr , which is a factor of a few larger than the typical simulation timestep .",
    "the tracer particles are passive and do not affect the dust abundance used in the chemical network , which we assume to be constant .",
    "furthermore , we do not inject any additional particles during the simulation since the timescale of dust production is long compared to the total runtime .",
    "the tracer particles are interpreted as representative ensembles of dust grains .",
    "we can assign a mass to each tracer particle by assuming that the total mass of dust is equally distributed among all tracer particles .",
    "for simplicity , we adopt the constant gas - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath32 derived for the interstellar dust model bare - gr - s , which consists of bare silicate and graphitic grains @xcite . a higher gas - to - dust ratio than a commonly used value of 100 is required by interstellar dust models that simultaneously fit dust extinction , infrared diffuse emission and element abundance constraints @xcite . for a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath32 and a total gas mass in the simulation volume @xmath33m@xmath26 ,",
    "the tracer particle mass becomes @xmath34 this definition allows us to convert between tracer particle numbers and dust masses .",
    "the bare - gr - s dust model is designed to match various observational constraints in the local diffuse ism .",
    "it is known that the gas - to - dust ratio in the dense gas can be a few times lower compared to the diffuse ism owing to accretion of gas - phase species onto grain surfaces .",
    "it is however very difficult to infer the true variations of the gas - to - dust ratio from observed dust emission maps , because it requires one to disentangle the effects of a number of different physical processes which affect dust emission in translucent molecular clouds : changes of the far - infrared dust properties due to coagulation of grains , the contribution of the co - dark molecular gas to the gas - to - dust ratio and the true decrease in the gas - to - dust ratio due to the dust growth in the ism @xcite .",
    "recent models of dust evolution in the inhomogeneous multi - phase ism study the variations of silicate dust abundance with local conditions , but are still uncertain in variations in the gas - to - dust ratio @xcite .    the difference in element depletion between the lines of sight with the lowest and the highest depletion levels in the large sample of data compiled by @xcite implies a variation of the gas - to - dust ratio of a factor of @xmath35 . with this factor ,",
    "the dust mass associated with a tracer particle @xmath36 in the dense phase can be higher , which is presently neglected in this work .",
    "the gas flow in the simulations is created mainly by two dynamical processes : gravity , which pulls the gas towards the disc midplane and leads to the formation of self - gravitating molecular clouds , and blast waves that are created by supernova explosions . as the gas moves",
    ", the tracer particles are advected with the flow . in a compressible gas ,",
    "the number density of tracer particles is roughly proportional to the gas density .",
    "therefore , tracer particles tend to accumulate in dense regions , and only relatively few tracer particles are present in voids or get injected into the halo .",
    "a very small fraction of tracer particles leaves the simulation box at @xmath37kpc during the simulation runtime : 2.95% for random driving , 0.04% for mixed driving and 0.02% for peak driving . since we do not know the fate of these particles , we only include tracer particles in our subsequent analysis that stay within the simulation box until the end .",
    "figure  [ fig : proj ] shows face - on and edge - on gas column densities together with the tracer particle locations for random , mixed and peak driving after 40  myr of evolutionsilcc/. ] . at the start of the simulation",
    ", the gas collapses towards the disc midplane until the supernova explosions have created enough thermal and kinetic pressure to support the gas against collapse .",
    "after 10myr , the random supernova driving has left a large fraction of the initial particle distribution in the disc plane unaffected , whereas the tracer particles are completely mixed after 40myr .",
    "as the simulations proceed , self - gravitating structures form that resist destruction by supernova blast waves . at 80myr ,",
    "most of the tracer particles reside in a few dense regions and within an outflow driven by supernova explosions from the diffuse medium .    for the case of mixed",
    "driving , some differences occur . here , every second explosion is located at density peaks . injecting supernovae at the places of highest density can lead to a runaway process when the supernova injection triggers the formation of a blast wave that creates a high - density shock .",
    "the density peak at the moment of the next supernova injection will then likely be located somewhere at the density enhancement created by this shock .",
    "a repeated injection of supernovae in a relatively small volume can then lead to an amplification of density contrasts that attracts subsequent supernova injections .",
    "this is what happens here in the first 10myr and what creates the spherical region visible in the face - on projection . because only half of all supernovae explode at random positions , a large fraction of the particles remain unperturbed by supernova explosions at this time",
    "however , after 40myr also in this simulation the tracer particles are completely mixed , and the disc scale height is similar to the simulation with random driving .",
    "once the ism has a sufficiently complex structure , the influence of the density peak supernovae on the mixing is reduced because a certain region in the disc is no longer favoured for supernova injections .",
    "the final snapshot at 80myr also looks similar to the situation for random driving .    in the simulation with pure peak driving ,",
    "the evolution is markedly different .",
    "now , all supernovae explode within a region of diameter @xmath38kpc in the first 10myr because of the described runaway process .",
    "supernova explosion sites propagate radially outwards from the location of the first explosion . at 40myr",
    ", the ism has a complex structure and the tracer particles are fully mixed .",
    "however , the initially clustered supernova explosions have created a cavity that remains for the rest of the simulation runtime . since supernovae are injected at density peaks , much less hot gas is created , and almost no galactic wind is driven @xcite . at 80myr ,",
    "the gas density in the disc is higher than for random and mixed driving , and the tracer particles are more homogeneously distributed .",
    "while ism dust models typically represent the ism phases with a single characteristic temperature , a more accurate phase definition assigns a whole temperature range to each phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "guided by our previous study of ism phases in the silcc simulations by @xcite , we consider four different phases defined by temperature cuts in this paper :    1 .   molecular phase ( @xmath39k ) , 2 .",
    "cold phase ( @xmath40k ) , 3 .",
    "warm phase ( @xmath41k ) , 4 .   hot phase ( @xmath42k ) .",
    "there are two important differences to our analysis in @xcite .",
    "first , we do not include a warm - hot phase because it is thermally unstable and therefore short - lived .",
    "hence , we subsume the warm - hot phase from @xcite in our warm phase .",
    "second , we choose a slightly higher temperature cut of @xmath29k to separate the molecular and the cold phase instead of @xmath43k as in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this higher temperature cut becomes evident from figure  [ fig : traj ] , where we plot the temperature histories of 10 randomly selected particles from the simulation with random driving . at our spatial grid resolution of @xmath10pc",
    ", we barely resolve temperatures below @xmath43k , so that this threshold value would lead to artifically low residence times in the molecular phase and artificially high transition rates between the molecular and the cold phase .    in @xcite",
    ", we compared our simulation results with the classical @xcite pressure equilibrium model of a three - phase ism .",
    "we found that the hot gas pressure in our simulations is in approximate equilibrium with the warm phase , and that the volume filling fraction of the hot gas , which fills the intercloud volume , is in agreement with predictions of this model .",
    "we stress that @xcite have shown that the temperature cuts do not directly correspond to transitions in the chemical composition .",
    "we therefore define a second , independent , set of ism phases using the chemical abundances of the different forms of hydrogen in our chemical network , or more precisely their corresponding mass fractions @xmath11 :    1 .",
    "h@xmath1 phase ( @xmath44 ) , 2 .",
    "h phase ( @xmath45 ) , 3 .",
    "h@xmath0 phase ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the histories of the mass fractions are also shown in figure  [ fig : traj ] for the same 10 particles .",
    "the time evolution of the chemical abundances is much smoother than the temperature evolution . in part",
    ", this is because the chemical timescale is often much longer than the dynamical timescale or cooling timescale , meaning that the chemical makeup of the gas frequently lags behind its thermal state .",
    "consequently , if the duration of a heating event and the subsequent cooling is short enough , the gas can move from one thermal phase to another and back again without ever significantly changing its chemical state .",
    "in addition , the temperature cuts that we use to define our different thermal phases are often only weakly correlated with chemical changes in the gas .",
    "for example , although the temperature range we adopt for our `` molecular '' phase is a relatively good match for the temperature inferred from co observations , there is both observational and theoretical evidence that co - dark h@xmath21 occupies a much broader range of temperatures @xcite .",
    "therefore , gas moving from the co - bright regime to the co - dark regime will undergo a transition from our `` molecular '' to our `` cold '' phase , but may remain dominated by h@xmath21 throughout .",
    "since there is no one - to - one correspondence between the two sets of phase definitions ( see also discussion in @xcite ) , the chemical abundance cuts provide a separate set of statistics for residence times and transition rates .",
    "these data are more physically meaningful but harder to compare to values in the literature because they are different from the traditional ism phase definitions .",
    "the displayed evolutionary tracks illustrate the complexity of interpreting the data in terms of grain properties .",
    "for example , in gas that is dense enough to shield itself from the interstellar radiation field , allowing molecular hydrogen to form , ice mantles can grow on the surfaces of dust grains .",
    "however , the tracks demonstrate that particles in the h@xmath1 phase are not protected from high temperatures , and even short periods of heating beyond the evaporation temperature ( or exposure to uv radiation ) can destroy the ice mantles again .",
    "we conclude that a single physical quantity ( density , column density , temperature , or chemical composition ) is not enough to characterise the grain properties , but all of them must be considered in concert .",
    "as the tracer particles get advected with the flow , they sample the entire phase space of the multi - phase ism .",
    "initially , they are homogeneously distributed across the disc , with a tracer particle number density that scales with the gas density . when the gas starts to move",
    ", regions of compressed gas will contain more tracer particles than voids .",
    "naturally , since the molecular and cold phase have a higher gas density than the warm and hot phase , the number density of tracer particles residing in these phases will also be larger .",
    "because the density contrast in the ism amounts to several orders of magnitude , we may inadequately sample the underdense gas with our @xmath31 tracer particles .    to check",
    "how well the fraction of particles @xmath47 in the different ism phases represents the corresponding total gas mass fractions @xmath48 , we plot both quantities for the three simulations as a function of time @xmath49 in figure  [ fig : pn ] for the ism phases defined by temperature cuts and in figure  [ fig : pnabun ] for the chemical abundance cuts .",
    "we see that for random and mixed driving , we need about @xmath50myr to produce a molecular phase with a total mass fraction in excess of @xmath51 . after this time",
    ", the mass fractions of the four phases only change within a factor of a few .    however , the particle fractions evolve notably differently than the mass fractions .",
    "the particle fraction in the molecular phase steadily increases over the simulation time , while the particle fraction in the cold phase decreases .",
    "a growing number of particles fall into the deep gravitational potential wells of molecular clouds ( compare figure  [ fig : proj ] ) and enter the molecular phase from the cold phase , explaining these overall trends .",
    "they can only escape from these regions when a supernova explodes in a nearby location .",
    "during such an event , a large number of particles gets ejected instantaneously from the molecular into the cold phase , from where they fall back into the molecular phase by gravitational attraction .",
    "this is the reason for the series of spikes that are superimposed on the general trend for the cold phase evolution after @xmath52myr .",
    "the particle fractions of the warm and hot phase remain roughly constant , although the hot phase shows large fluctuations due to the small absolute particle numbers in this phase .    for peak driving ,",
    "the situation is qualitatively different . here , continuous supernova explosions in the dense gas delay the formation of a molecular phase substantially .",
    "it takes 60myr until the mass fraction for the molecular phase reaches similar values as for random and mixed driving .",
    "simultaneously , the hot phase disappears completely .",
    "the regions in which the supernovae explode are now so dense that no significant amount of hot gas is produced anymore .    in general , the particle fractions @xmath47 and the total gas mass fractions @xmath48 agree within a factor of a few . in absolute values ,",
    "the differences are largest in the molecular phase , while the biggest relative error between @xmath47 and @xmath48 occurs for the hot phase .",
    "because of the discrepancies between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we must be aware that the tracer particles do not equally sample the full simulation box .",
    "we note that this may be due to a fundamental problem of lagrangian tracer particles in highly compressible flows @xcite , and therefore the mismatch is unlikely to be solved by simply increasing the total number of tracer particles . instead , early stellar feedback from winds @xcite and radiation @xcite may prevent the tracer particles from being locked inside clouds and facilitate a much better circulation of the particles through the different ism phases .",
    "we plan to test this hypothesis in future work .",
    "the evolution of the chemical phases shown in figure  [ fig : pnabun ] is more regular compared to the temperature cuts , which can be directly traced back to the less erratic individual trajectories .",
    "the definition of the chemical phases is more robust with respect to perturbations . in particular , supernova explosions near molecular clouds",
    "do not eject a large number of locked particles into regions where the molecular mass fraction is less than 50% , so that these particles do not change their phase .",
    "in general , the agreement between particle fractions and total gas mass fractions is better than for the temperature cuts . a substantial difference in the time evolution of the ism phases between the simulations",
    "can be observed in the run with peak driving , where an h@xmath1 phase is beginning to build up at @xmath53myr but then gets completely destroyed again at @xmath52myr . the h@xmath1 phase can only persist after @xmath18myr . in this simulation ,",
    "the h phase is by far dominant for most of the simulation runtime because the supernova explosions at density peaks can very effectively delay the formation of significant amounts of molecular hydrogen .",
    "mass exchange between the ism phases plays an important role in the lifecycle of interstellar grains .",
    "it controls the circulation of gas from the wnm , where dust abundances are reduced by destruction in interstellar shocks , and matter enriched with dust due to accretion on grain surfaces at higher gas densities .",
    "several models of dust evolution in the idealised two- and three - phase ism have been proposed to explain the observed differences between element depletion in the warm medium and cold clouds @xcite .",
    "models with a two - phase ism neglect the difference between the molecular and diffuse h  i  clouds and consider mass circulation only between the ambient warm medium and clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a three - phase ism model with an additional mass exchange with the molecular clouds reproduces the observations better . assuming a steady state for the interchange between phases and timescales of dust destruction and accretion",
    ", one can estimate the rates of mass exchange required to reproduce the observed element depletion @xcite . the resulting rates , however , depend on the adopted scheme of mass transfer between phases that in the case of the three - phase ism can occur via different routes . for example , depending on whether the wnm is converted to molecular clouds directly or through the cnm",
    ", the mass exchange rates between the cnm and molecular clouds can differ by a factor of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mass circulation scheme , the outcome of dust evolution models depends on the implementation of dust destruction by supernova shocks and dust growth by accretion in clouds , which introduce more uncertainties in the models .",
    "for example , unknown details of the growth process , in particular , the efficiency of sticking of incident species on the grain surfaces can strongly affect the value of the accretion timescale and the resulting dust abundance distribution @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we clarify the uncertainties in dust evolution modelling with respect to the matter cycle and mass exchange scheme by means of numerical simulations of the turbulent ism and provide a basis for studies of grain processing in the ism .",
    "the simulations allow us to directly measure the mass interchange rates between the different ism phases defined in section  [ sec : traj ] in a dynamically more realistic situation . in the following , we analyse the mass exchange rates predicted by the three simulations with the different supernova locations to determine the dominant transitions between phases .",
    "the transition rates between the different ism phases for the simulations with random , mixed and peak driving are shown in figure  [ fig : trall ] as function of time @xmath49 .",
    "we express the transition rates as time derivatives of the particle fractions , @xmath55 , and of the dust surface density , @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the number of particles transitioning from phase @xmath58 to phase @xmath59 at time @xmath49 , then the corresponding transition rate of the particle fraction is @xmath60 and the transition rate for the surface density is @xmath61 with the surface area of our simulation box @xmath62kpc@xmath63 . as already noted in section  [ sec : sam ] , it takes 10myr for the molecular phase to form , which is also reflected in the transition rates . after this initial period ,",
    "all four ism phases coexist in the simulations , with the exception of the disappearance of the hot phase in the peak driving run after 60myr .",
    "a common feature of all transition rates is their high intermittency .",
    "the main reason for this is the sudden heating of the gas by supernova explosions and the subsequent cooling process .",
    "depending on the location of the supernova explosion ( i.e. , the local gas density ) , both the peak temperature reached during an explosion event and the timescale for cooling of the remnant afterwards varies .",
    "therefore , the dominant phase transitions and their rates depend on the supernova positioning and are different for each simulation .    the simulation with random driving is dominated by the transitions between the molecular and the cold phase .",
    "this is reasonable since these two phases are directly connected and contain most tracer particles .",
    "the rate itself varies by more than an order of magnitude around a mean value of @xmath64yr@xmath65 or @xmath66m@xmath15gyr@xmath24pc@xmath16 .",
    "the next most dominant rate , which is roughly one order of magnitude lower , is the one between the cold and the warm phase , which again can be understood in terms of the particle fractions .",
    "these two transitions are to a very good approximation in detailed balance , meaning that the number of particles undergoing the transition from the cooler to the warmer phase equals the number of particles making the transition in the other direction .",
    "intermittently , the direct transition from the molecular to the warm phase becomes important , too .",
    "this is an example for a transition rate in which an intermediate phase ( the cold phase ) is skipped at the time resolution of our sampling rate for the tracer particle data , which is 10kyr .",
    "this effect is caused by the supernovae that explode in dense gas .",
    "the supernova injection then quickly heats up the gas and brings it into the warm phase .",
    "usually , the cooling time after the supernova injection is much longer than 10kyr , which explains why the inverse transition does not occur very often . instead , cooling proceeds via the cold phase as an intermediate step .",
    "the simulation with mixed driving shows a slightly different behaviour . here , the transition rate between the molecular and the cold phase is comparable to the case of random driving , but the transitions between the molecular and the warm phase are now dominant .",
    "this effect is caused by the 50% of all supernovae that explode at density peaks in this run .",
    "these density peaks are usually found in the molecular phase .",
    "a supernova explosion then triggers a transition into the warm phase , but at the density peaks the cooling time is short enough that tracer particles directly fall back into the molecular phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a small fraction of these particles does make a transition via the cold phase as an intermediate step , but the molecular and the warm phase are to a good approximation in detailed balance , as are all transitions between neighbouring phases .",
    "the peak driving simulation shows yet another behaviour . here",
    ", because of the suppression of the molecular phase , the molecular - cold transition is insignificant .",
    "instead , the direct transition cold - warm and its inverse transition warm - cold are dominant .",
    "after the molecular phase has formed , the indirect transition molecular - warm and the inverse transition cold - molecular also become significant since many particles reside in the dense gas .",
    "these transitions reflect the heating and cooling cycle after supernova explosions .",
    "the injection of thermal energy brings the gas from the cold into the warm or hot phase . in the hot phase ,",
    "the gas cools via the warm phase down to the cold phase again .",
    "after 60myr , the hot phase can not be maintained anymore , and the supernova explosions only produce a warm phase since they explode in high - density environments and cool quickly .",
    "the transition rates for the ism phases defined by chemical abundances behave differently from the phases defined by temperature cuts . here , detailed balance only occurs between the h phase and the h@xmath0 phase .",
    "the chemical evolution for random and mixed driving is almost identical , despite the large differences in the temperature evolution .",
    "both simulations show a significantly larger transition from the h phase into the h@xmath1 phase than vice versa , which reflects the net h@xmath1 formation observed in the simulations ( compare figure  [ fig : pnabun ] ) .",
    "the transition rates for the peak driving run reveal the formation and destruction of h@xmath1 between @xmath67 and @xmath52myr , and the disappearance of the h@xmath0 phase and the final formation of an h@xmath1 phase after @xmath18myr .      in the following , we compare the mass transfer rates directly measured in our simulations with the rates required by simple dust evolution models to reproduce the observed differences in interstellar element depletion observed in the cold and warm medium .",
    "@xcite adopts a three - phase ism with characteristic temperatures of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70k in the molecular , cold and warm phase , respectively .",
    "he considers two schemes for the mass circulation presented in his table  iii , model  a and model  b , which only differ in their mass exchange rates but otherwise have identical parameters .",
    "model  a has a molecular - cold transition rate of @xmath71yr@xmath65 and a cold - warm transition rate of @xmath72yr@xmath65 .",
    "both transitions are assumed to be in detailed balance .",
    "this model is broadly consistent with the time - averaged behaviour we see in our simulation with random driving .",
    "in contrast , his model  b assumes a molecular - cold transition rate of @xmath73yr@xmath65 and an inverse transition rate of @xmath74yr@xmath65 .",
    "the cold - warm transition rate in this model is assumed to be @xmath72yr@xmath65 , and the inverse transition goes directly from the warm to the molecular phase with the same rate .",
    "this model is not consistent with any of our simulations , for several reasons .",
    "the magnitude of his molecular - cold transition is too small , the relative strengths of the molecular - cold and cold - warm transitions do not match , and it is difficult to get a warm - molecular transition rate that is of similar strength as the cold - warm transition rate .",
    "@xcite adopt a different scheme of the mass exchange in the ism , in which molecular clouds are formed from the cnm and , upon destruction , are circulated directly to the warm phase .",
    "the cnm is formed by cooling of the wnm and can exchange mass with both the wnm and molecular clouds .",
    "transitions from molecular clouds to the cnm or from the wnm to the molecular phase are not considered in the model .",
    "their model includes dust growth by accretion , dust destruction in the ism and input from stellar sources or galactic inflows .",
    "the main feature of this model is that it incorporates the enhanced accretion rates due to focusing of ions on small negatively charged grains in the cold and warm phases ( see the following subsection ) .",
    "the transition rates between phases are then computed from the model parameters and are given in their table  3 .",
    "their scheme of mass exchange is also not supported by our results as we observe intense mass transfer from the warm to the molecular phase in the simulations with mixed driving and from the molecular to the cold phase in the case of random driving , which are absent in @xcite .",
    "the transition rates included in their scheme of the order of a few @xmath75yr@xmath65 are roughly similar to the values predicted by our simulations , except the last @xmath67myr for the mixed and peak driving simulations , when the dominant mass exchange rates exceed @xmath76yr@xmath65 .    since relative dust abundances are higher in molecular clouds , the pathway of circulation of matter from molecular clouds to warm gas influences the distribution of interstellar element depletion @xcite .",
    "if dust - rich gas from molecular clouds rapidly circulates to the wnm , the average element abundances in dust in the wnm will be higher compared to the case when dust - rich matter circulates from molecular clouds to the wnm through the cnm .",
    "the latter scenario agrees with our simulation with random driving .",
    "the faster , direct circulation between molecular clouds and the warm medium appears in the simulation with mixed driving .      for random and mixed driving , we study the implications of our measured transition rates for predictions of element depletion on dust grains with the simple model of @xcite .",
    "they used the observed depletion to infer the transition rates between the phases in their mass transfer scheme . here , we reverse the procedure and take the transition rates as given to compute the depletion . for consistency ,",
    "we leave all other parameters of the model unchanged .",
    "we adopt model  a and model  b of @xcite , which use different grain size distributions and destruction timescales .",
    "below we briefly describe the models and refer to the original publication for more details .",
    "we then compare our results with the observed depletion in the warm and cold medium .",
    "since the transition rates in the simulations are highly fluctuating , we take the average transition rates from @xmath77myr to @xmath78myr .",

    "the first ( upper ) number is the arithmetic mean , the second ( lower ) one the median value of the distribution .",
    "it seems natural to compare the residence times in the molecular and h@xmath1 phases with theoretical estimates of molecular cloud lifetimes .",
    "using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of isolated disc galaxies with supernova feedback , @xcite estimated that giant molecular clouds with masses above @xmath82m@xmath26 live for at least @xmath29myr before they return their material back to the diffuse ism . in this work ,",
    "a simple density criterion was used to decide whether an sph particle was part of a molecular cloud or in the diffuse phase .",
    "in contrast , @xcite , using similar simulations , employed a clump - finding algorithm to identify sph particles belonging to giant molecular clouds and determined the cloud lifetime through the dispersal of the selected particles .",
    "this criterion led to much shorter timescales of only @xmath83 to @xmath84myr for giant molecular clouds .    with a semi - analytic model of cloud destruction by photoionization feedback ,",
    "@xcite obtained cloud lifetimes of @xmath67 to @xmath43myr .",
    "our characteristic residence times in the molecular phase are shorter , even without early stellar feedback by winds and radiation . in fact , our peak driving simulation may give better values for the molecular phase residence times in this respect than the runs with random and mixed driving , although it otherwise does not produce a realistic ism .",
    "the small values for the molecular phase residence time are remarkable since they represent upper limits to the cloud lifetimes , given that they only measure the time spent in molecular material , during which the particles could circulate between several clouds .",
    "this is even more likely the case for the h@xmath1 phase , which has much longer residence times than the molecular phase .",
    "our study of the residence times has implications for simple models of dust evolution that treat the multi - phase ism and the mass exchange between phases in a parametrised way @xcite . in a model proposed by @xcite , the residence time of grains in molecular clouds",
    "has a fixed value and is equivalent to the lifetime of clouds @xmath85 .",
    "it is an important parameter that has a two - fold effect on the rate of dust growth by accretion in the molecular clouds .",
    "if the lifetime of molecular clouds is @xmath86 times longer than the timescale of accretion of gas - phase species on dust , which has a value of 1  myr for the solar metallicity , then refractory elements are almost completely condensed on dust grains during their residence in molecular clouds .",
    "the matter is thus returned to the diffuse phase with the maximum dust abundances upon disruption of the clouds . however , a further increase of the cloud lifetime delays the return of the dust - rich matter to the diffuse phase and decreases the total rate of dust production in the ism . because the latter is the dominant mechanism of dust production in the present - day milky way , a longer residence time results in a lower dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "@xcite adopted a value of @xmath6myr for the molecular cloud lifetime .",
    "it is @xmath87 to @xmath35 times shorter than the mean residence time in the molecular phase derived from our simulations with random and mixed driving .",
    "the distribution of the residence times is flat from a few up to @xmath88myr , a large portion of grains thus reside up to @xmath83 times longer than @xmath6myr .",
    "a longer value of the cloud lifetime of @xmath68myr has also been adopted by @xcite in his model of the dust cycle between the diffuse medium and clouds .",
    "we investigate the impact of a longer residence of grains in the molecular phase on the dust - to - gas ratio using the model of dust evolution at the local solar galactocentric radius from @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dgr ] shows the time evolution of the average dust - to - gas ratio for different values of the @xmath89 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath29myr . for the @xmath90 and @xmath68myr ,",
    "the present dust - to - gas ratio ( for @xmath91gyr ) is , respectively , only 3% and 7% lower than for the reference value . with a longer @xmath92myr ,",
    "the final dust - to - gas ratio is decreased by 15% .",
    "therefore , the broad distributions of the residence times in the molecular phase from our simulations imply a decrease in the average dust abundances by less than 10% .",
    "the derived distributions of the residence times in the ism phases have larger consequences for the grain size and gas - phase element abundance distributions . in molecular clouds ,",
    "grains grow their sizes by coagulation and accretion .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that , because of these processes , the residence time in the dense gas is imprinted in such observable dust characteristics as the extinction curve and element depletion .",
    "broad distributions of the residence times in molecular clouds as found in this work imply that matter that is transferred to the diffuse phase upon disruption of clouds should exhibit large variations in the grain size and element depletion distributions because of the different dynamical histories of the gas .",
    "indeed , large dispersion of si gas - phase element abundances for a given gas volume density was recently found by @xcite with models of dust evolution in an inhomogeneous ism .",
    "we conclude that the observed scatter in the interstellar element depletion may arise not only because of local conditions , but may be caused by different dynamical histories of the gas .",
    "similar arguments are valid for the observed variations of interstellar extinction curves @xcite .",
    "the residence time in the warm phase determines the degree of grain processing by turbulence , which shatters large grains into smaller fragments . our simulations with random and mixed driving yield a mean residence time in the warm medium of about @xmath88myr , with a large dispersion .",
    "longer residence times in the warm medium ( @xmath93myr ) are required by models of the evolution of interstellar grain sizes to create a population of small grains detected by observations @xcite .",
    "such a longer timescale is necessary , because @xcite adopt an initial size distribution dominated by large @xmath94 m grains , assuming that small grains are removed by coagulation in molecular clouds .",
    "however , as we discussed above , not all grains spend equally long times in molecular clouds ( see figure  [ fig : rthistlin ] ) , meaning that not all gas is equally processed by coagulation .",
    "moreover , coagulation works efficiently at gas densities of @xmath95 and above .",
    "a large portion of molecular gas in our simulations resides at lower densities and should retain small grains .     in the local milky way for the different values of the lifetime of molecular clouds @xmath96 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath97myr ( from top to bottom ) predicted by the model of dust evolution from @xcite . ]      in addition to the processing of interstellar dust discussed above , grains are irradiated by galactic cosmic rays . as a result ,",
    "grains that remain in the ism for a certain time have an excess of cosmic - ray - produced nuclides , which increases with their residence time .",
    "some interstellar grains that survived the formation of the solar system can be identified in primitive meteorites .",
    "laboratory measurements of cosmic - ray - produced nuclides , in particular noble gas isotopes , in these presolar grains are used to estimate the time period the grains were exposed to cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "information on the distribution of grain residence times directly measured in the laboratory provides an invaluable test for theoretical models of dust evolution .",
    "a common assumption in this method is that the cosmic ray flux is on average constant in space .",
    "the values of the residence times in the ism ( i.e. , the exposure times ) derived by @xcite range from @xmath98 to @xmath99myr and from @xmath88 to @xmath100myr in work by @xcite . since the majority of the studied presolar grains have ages longer than @xmath69myr , it means that they cycled a few times between the warm medium and the clouds before they got trapped during the solar system formation .",
    "it has been shown recently that the cosmic ray ionisation rate decreases in the dense molecular clouds compared to the diffuse lines of sight because low - energy cosmic rays , which are most efficient at ionisation , lose their energy before they reach the interiors of dense clouds ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "using hydrodynamical simulations of the ism evolution , we find that on average the grains spend two times longer in the warm gas compared to the molecular cloud ( about @xmath67 and @xmath88myr , respectively ) , and , additionally , @xmath101@xmath102myr in the cold diffuse medium .",
    "thus , about one third of their residence in the ism , grains spend at the environment with a lower ionisation rate .",
    "taking this into account may lead to longer residence times in the ism in presolar grain studies .",
    "ism simulations including cosmic rays @xcite will help to understand this effect .",
    "dust grains undergo different processing when they are exposed to the interstellar radiation field or shielded from it . for every grid cell ,",
    "we determine @xmath103 by the arithmetic mean of @xmath104 steradian maps of the total hydrogen column density using the ` treecol ` algorithm @xcite .",
    "we restrict the column density calculation to a radius of @xmath29pc and take the periodic boundaries in the disc plane into account @xcite . since we thus know the strength of the radiation field at the location of the tracer particles , we can compute the residence times in regions of high and low @xmath103 .",
    "we consider two different threshold values @xmath105 , namely @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the value @xmath108 to @xmath83 is the threshold extinction for the detection of ice mantles around dust grains derived in infrared spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "we show the histograms of residence times at @xmath81myr for the three simulations in figure  [ fig : rthistav ] and the cumulative probability distribution functions in figure  [ fig : rthistavnormcum ] .",
    "we have used exactly the same procedure to produce the statistics as for the ism phases . just as with the previous histograms , the results for random and mixed driving are very similar .",
    "the statistics for @xmath106 and @xmath107 is not very different at the highest particle counts , which implies that gas at these extinctions collapses into molecular clouds and is dispersed on very similar time scales .",
    "qualitatively , the histrograms resemble the distributions for the h@xmath1 phase in figure  [ fig : rthistlin ] for random and mixed driving .",
    "quantitatively , there are more particles in the h@xmath1 phase than with @xmath109 since @xmath110 to @xmath111 is sufficient to from h@xmath1 due to self - shielding .",
    "the large residence times imply that both shielding from as well as exposure to the interstellar radiation field are typically long - term processes that last more than @xmath29myr , at least in the absence of early feedback . for peak",
    "driving , with the constant supernova injections in dense gas , particles with @xmath112 do not exist , and most particles reside in regions with @xmath113 for a long time .",
    "some particles do have @xmath109 , although there is no h@xmath1 phase at this time of the simulation .",

    "the analysis presented in this work is only a first step . here",
    "we aim at a systematic investigation of different methods of supernova positioning in simulations where supernovae explode at a constant rate .",
    "clearly , some of our results will be different for more realistic simulations .",
    "self - consistent and early feedback by stellar winds @xcite and radiation @xcite will likely reduce the residence time of grains in the molecular and h@xmath1 phase .",
    "early feedback will also mitigate the overcooling problem for supernova explosions in dense gas by creating cavities inside clouds before the first supernovae explode @xcite .",
    "this may significantly alter the transition rates .",
    "self - consistent feedback also allows for self - regulation of star formation , so that our simulations can reach some form of steady state in the ism properties .",
    "our measured transition rates and residence times would then be independent of the stage of the simulation .",
    "further caveats are related to our simulation setup . including galactic rotation through shearing box boundary conditions",
    "may contribute to cloud disruption and further reduce the molecular and h@xmath1 residence times .",
    "furthermore , our limited numerical resolution in the dense gas may also affect our measured residence times in the molecular and h@xmath1 phase and in regions with @xmath112 .",
    "finally , the non - uniform sampling of the ism by the lagrangian tracer particles leads to discrepancies between gas mass fractions and particle fractions .",
    "this disagreement should be eliminated to better represent the simulated ism with the tracer particle technique .",
    "we plan to address these issues in future work .",
    "we present a pilot study in which we measure , for the first time , the residence times of interstellar dust in the different ism phases , and the transition rates between the phases .",
    "we use hydrodynamical simulations from the silcc project that are similar to previous work @xcite , but with a smaller box height and with lagrangian tracer particles to probe the physical conditions for interstellar dust grains .",
    "we find complex evolutionary histories of the dust grains , which in general reside in multiple ism phases during the simulation runtime .",
    "the development of the ism phases , the dominant transition rates between phases , and the residence times are a strong function of supernova positioning , that is they differ depending on whether supernovae explode at random positions , at density peaks , or as a mixture of the two .    in simulations with random and mixed driving",
    ", the resulting ism is similar .",
    "for random driving , transitions between the molecular and cold phase dominate , followed by transitions between the cold and warm and intermittently between the molecular and warm phases . for mixed",
    "driving , molecular - warm transitions outweigh the other transitions because of the 50% fraction of peak supernovae .",
    "most of the transitions are in detailed balance . for peak",
    "driving , the formation of a molecular phase is suppressed initially , and the hot phase eventually disappears .",
    "hence , the transition rates change significantly at different stages of the simulation . for the most realistic simulations with random and mixed driving , we model the ti gas - phase depletion with a simple model of dust evolution using the measured transition rates",
    "we find the best agreement with observations for random driving , although we under - predict the ti depletion in the molecular phase in all models .",
    "residence times generally have broad distributions , in contrast to the single values used in idealised models .",
    "the residence time distribution in the runs with random and mixed driving is similar , with median residence times in the molecular , cold , warm and hot phase around @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5myr , respectively .",
    "peak driving , in contrast , leads to median residence times of @xmath35 , @xmath54 , @xmath116 and @xmath117myr in these phases .",
    "the residence times in the cold phase agree well in all simulations , although the ism structure is very different .",
    "therefore , characteristic residence times are not a good description of the multi - phase ism .",
    "the broad distribution of residence times in the molecular phase implies a reduction of the dust - to - gas ratio at the percent level in the dust and chemical evolution model by @xcite , and may contribute to the scatter in the observed gas - phase element depletion .",
    "ism phases defined by chemical abundance rather than temperature cuts are more stable with respect to perturbations by shocks and supernova explosions .",
    "they therefore generally show smaller transition rates and have longer residence times . for random and mixed driving ,",
    "the median residence times in the h@xmath1 and h  phase are around @xmath118 and @xmath119 myr , respectively .",
    "the residence time in h@xmath1-dominated gas is therefore significantly longer than the residence time in gas with @xmath120k , which stresses the importance of including chemistry in simulations of the multi - phase ism .",
    "in contrast , the residence time distribution in the h@xmath0 phase coincides with the hot phase distribution .",
    "the @xmath103 residence time statistics agree well with the statistics for the h@xmath1 phase .",
