    "numerous astronomical observations have indicated that most of the matter in the universe is invisible , exotic , and nonrelativistic dark matter  @xcite . however , despite considerable experimental effort , the nature of the dark matter remains unknown .",
    "the weakly interacting massive particle  ( wimp ) is a candidate that conforms to the stringent standards for particle dark matter , and it is supported by astronomical observations as well as particle physics theories that extend the standard model  @xcite .",
    "numerous experiments have searched for wimps by directly detecting nuclei recoiling from wimp  nucleus interactions  @xcite .",
    "it is essential to reduce the background level as much as possible for dark matter searches because of the extremely low cross - section of the wimp  nucleon interaction .",
    "the dominant background contributions produced by external sources , such as decaying radioisotopes in surrounding materials and cosmogenic muons , can be reduced by shielding the detector in a deep underground laboratory using heavy materials consisting of lead , copper , and polyethylene layers .",
    "however , remnants of this contribution , as well as the background contribution from materials close to the detector , still exist .",
    "in addition to passive shielding , it is beneficial to have an active veto system that can reduce the background level by tagging neutron and @xmath2 events  @xcite from external sources .",
    "an active veto system can also reduce the level of the internal background by tagging the escaping @xmath2-rays .",
    "the korea invisible mass search ( kims ) collaboration is developing ultralow - background nai(tl ) crystal detectors  @xcite to verify an observation of an annual modulation in the detection rate of an array of nai(tl ) crystals  @xcite that can be interpreted as the result of interaction with wimps . even though the internal radioisotopes of the nai(tl ) crystals were identified and might be further reduced by future development , the background contributions originating from detector components , such as photomultiplier tubes  ( pmts ) , encapsulating copper cases , and shielding materials , are not perfectly rejected .",
    "we consider a new shielding structure including an active veto system that surrounds the nai(tl ) crystals with a liquid scintillator  ( ls ) in order to tag the internal @xmath0k background as well as reduce the external background contributions .",
    "we build a prototype active veto detector to verify the performance of the full shielding before finishing its final design . in this article",
    ", we describe the prototype active veto detector from construction to performance .",
    "in addition , a shielding design for a future nai(tl ) experiment is presented .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we count the event rate of the nai(tl ) detector with and without the ls veto requirement , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ref : fig.lsveto.nai ] .",
    "the detector realizes a significant reduction in the background rate by requiring that no signal appear in the ls veto detector .",
    "the tagging efficiency is 26.5 @xmath1 1.7% in the 620  kev energy region and 63 @xmath1 1% in the 1001500  kev energy region .",
    "the tagged event rate between 6 and 20  kev is 0.76 @xmath1 0.04  events / kev / kg / day ( dru ) .",
    "we simulate various background sources with the geant4  @xcite simulation package to obtain the veto efficiency of the prototype .",
    "we first consider the internal @xmath0k decay , which is one of the strongest backgrounds for dark matter searches with nai(tl ) crystals  @xcite .",
    "this decay generates an x - ray at approximately 3  kev with a 1460  kev @xmath2-ray . if the accompanying 1460  kev @xmath2-ray escapes from the crystal , the event consists of a single 3  kev hit , which mimics a dark matter signal .",
    "however , if we tag the escaping 1460  kev @xmath2-ray with the ls veto detector , we can effectively reduce the low - energy contribution of the 3  kev x - ray in the nai(tl ) crystal  @xcite .",
    "the veto efficiency for energies between 0 and 10  kev is about 48% from the internal @xmath0k simulation .",
    "we estimate the k contamination of the nai(tl ) crystal using the events vetoed by the ls veto detector to verify our simulation .",
    "the filled ( blue ) circles in fig .  [ ref : fig.lsveto.nai ]  ( b ) show the low - energy spectrum of the nai(tl ) crystal that is tagged by the ls veto detector . in this figure ,",
    "the tagged 3  kev x - ray events can be extracted by gaussian fitting assuming a flat background .",
    "the measured rate is 2.10  @xmath1  0.32",
    "counts / kg / day , which is found to correspond to 43.7  @xmath1  6.4  ppb k contamination by a comparison with the simulation .",
    "this value is consistent with a previous measurement  ( 49.3  @xmath1  2.4  ppb ) of the same crystal in a different veto system in which neighboring csi(tl ) crystals are used to tag the @xmath0k events  @xcite .",
    "other than the internal background of the nai(tl ) crystal , one of the main background contributions arises from the natural radioisotopes , @xmath3u , @xmath4th , and @xmath0k , in the pmts .",
    "we simulate these isotopes from the photocathode as well as the glass envelope and estimate the veto efficiencies in the 010  kev measured energy range , which are 66% , 56% , and 63% for @xmath3u , @xmath4th , and @xmath0k , respectively .",
    "other background contributions from outside the ls veto system are tagged at a level that is at least similar to that of the pmts .",
    "k as a function of the thickness of the nai(tl ) crystal and the ls container for energies between 0 and 10  kev obtained from a simple geometric simulation .",
    "square symbol represents the veto efficiency of the prototype detector from the simulation . ]        the veto efficiency of the prototype detector is limited by the narrow thickness of the container necessitated by the small available space in the existing shielding at y2l .",
    "we plan to construct a dedicated shielding structure for the 200  kg array experiment using nai(tl ) crystals  @xcite . in this shielding structure",
    ", we can consider a much bigger container for the ls veto system to increase the veto efficiency .",
    "the optimization is based on the simulation of the internal @xmath0k background .",
    "we consider a simple cubic structure of the ls container in which one nai(tl ) crystal  ( same geometry as nai-002 ) is immersed in the center .",
    "the thicknesses of the nai(tl ) crystal ends and the ls container wall are the same and vary from 10 to 150  cm .",
    "figure  [ ref : fig.veto.eff.curve ] shows the veto efficiency as a function of the ls thickness .",
    "we consider an ls with a minimum thickness of 40  cm for the final design by considering the size of the shielding as well as the veto efficiency .",
    "the veto efficiency measured by the prototype detector is consistent with the simulated efficiency for a 17-cm - thick container , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ref : fig.veto.eff.curve ] .    an ls veto detector 40",
    "cm thick can tag approximately 75% of the internal @xmath0k events at 010  kev .",
    "the untagged 25% of events are due to 1460  kev @xmath2-rays escaping without any heat in the ls veto detector .",
    "the background contribution from the internal @xmath0k with the new veto design can be effectively reduced by a factor of two because the 25% of untagged events represents a reduction of approximately two times compared to the 52% of untagged events with the prototype detector .",
    "we finalized the design of the new ls veto system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ref : fig.maincubox0 ] , considering the discussion above .",
    "the minimum thickness of the ls from each end of the crystal is 40  cm .",
    "the average tagging efficiency of the ls veto system and the other crystals for the internal @xmath0k is estimated to be 81% .",
    "the veto efficiencies for the pmts are predicted to be approximately 80% for u , th , and k.",
    "we constructed a prototype ls veto detector to determine the feasibility of tagging the background of a nai(tl ) crystal detector for a dark matter search experiment .",
    "the tagged background rate of the nai(tl ) crystal is 0.76 @xmath1 0.04  dru at 620 kev .",
    "the tagging efficiency of the 3  kev x - rays from internal @xmath0k is about 48% from the simulation .",
    "the measured event rates of 3  kev x - rays with the required ls veto signal are in good agreement with a previous measurement . a new shield with an appropriate ls thickness will increase this rate to approximately 80% .",
