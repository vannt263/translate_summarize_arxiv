    "bacterial biofilms are microbial communities on immersed surfaces , embedded in layers of self - produced extracellular polymeric substances ( eps ) , which protect the sessile cells against mechanical or chemical washout @xcite .",
    "biofilms are prevalent in natural , industrial and hospital settings . depending on the context",
    ", they can be harmful or beneficial .",
    "for example biofilms can lead to corrosion problems in fresh water pipes , and oil pipelines @xcite ; foremost cause of failure of medical implants are bacterial infections caused by biofilm formation @xcite ; biofilms can lead to crop disease in plants @xcite ; dental plaque is an oral biofilm on teeth that causes dental disease @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the adsorption and absorption properties and enhanced mechanical stability of biofilms make them advantageous to environmental engineering technologies , e.g. for waste water treatment , remediation of contaminated soil , and elimination of petroleum oil from contaminated oceans or marine systems @xcite .",
    "although the term biofilm suggests a homogeneous film - like layer , biofilms on the meso - scale ( @xmath0 , the  actual  biofilm  scale ) in reality are spatially heterogeneous assemblages of colonies which may merge as they grow and expand @xcite .",
    "the architecture of a biofilm depends on some biological factors such as maximum cell density , specific growth rate , and local nutrient availability . in environments with unlimited amount of substrate , biofilms tend to grow quickly and form homogeneous , compact , thick layer . on the other hand ,",
    "biofilms in nutrient limited regimes tend to form in patchy heterogeneous structures .",
    "several mathematical models have been proposed in the literature to describe the growth of spatially heterogeneous biofilms , ranging from stochastic individual based models to cellular automata models to deterministic continuum models , cf @xcite and the references that they cite .",
    "the underlying mathematical principles of these models are quite different and , therefore , the mathematical and computational challenges vary from model to model .",
    "nevertheless , they all show the same qualitative behaviour in predicting the development of biofilm morphologies in response to substrate limitation @xcite .",
    "an early prototype biofilm growth model has been introduced in @xcite , and was extended later to account for further biofilm aspects and processes , such as quorum sensing , response to antibiotics , internally triggered dispersal , eps production , and multispecies systems , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the model has been derived both from the view point of biofilms as spatially structured populations @xcite and as a fluid @xcite , thus reflecting the ecological - mechanical duality of biofilms . in its basic form as a biofilm growth model ,",
    "it consists of a density - dependent diffusion - reaction equation for biomass that is coupled with a semi - linear diffusion - reaction equation for growth limiting nutrients .",
    "the biomass equation shows two interacting non - linear diffusion effects : ( i ) the diffusion coefficient vanishes where the biomass vanishes as in the porous medium equation , and ( ii ) a super - diffusion singularity as the dependent variable in the diffusion coefficient approaches the known maximum density .",
    "the interplay of both effects assures that the solution of the biomass equation is bounded by the maximum cell density @xcite , that spatial expansion of the biofilm only takes place if locally no space is available to produce new biomass ( i.e. a volume filling effect ) , and that initial data with compact support have solutions with compact support @xcite .",
    "the latter property is a characteristic property of the porous medium equation and related problems . in our application",
    "this expresses itself as a sharp biofilm / water interface , at which the biomass gradient blows up . since biofilm colonies grow , their interfaces with the aqueous phase are not stationary but change over time .",
    "eventually neighbouring colonies can merge into a bigger colony , in which case their interfaces merge and dissolve .",
    "interface problems of this type pose difficulties for numerical and analytical methods .",
    "the steep biomass gradients at the interface can lead to interface smearing or spurious oscillations in numerical solutions .",
    "the singularity in the density - dependent diffusion coefficient leads to a blow up of model coefficients and forces the numerical method to work with very small time - steps .",
    "several methods have been proposed in the literature for the numerical treatment of this highly non - linear degenerate model .    in @xcite",
    "a hybrid time - integration strategy was applied .",
    "the slower biomass processes were solved explicitly with an embedded runge - kutta - fehlberg method , whereas the faster nutrient processes were solved implicitly .",
    "this required inefficiently small time steps for the biomass equation when the biomass density approaches maximum density somewhere .",
    "a different idea was explored in @xcite in which the degenerate equation is transformed into new dependent variables such that the spatial operator converted into the laplacian operator and all non - linear effects appeared in the time - derivative . a fully implicit , fixed time - step method for the new equation could handle the diffusion singularity effect very well , but emphasized interface oscillations . in @xcite",
    "a fully adaptive in space and time method was proposed in the 1d case , based on a weak moving frame formulation .",
    "this method explicitly tracked the biofilm / water interface and was able to deal well with the porous medium degeneracy but had problems with the super - diffusion singularity .",
    "in @xcite the transformation idea of @xcite was combined with the moving frame approach of @xcite .",
    "this method worked very well in 1d but in the 2d case becomes cumbersome ; moreover , it was not obvious how it could be adapted for multi - species biofilm systems .",
    "a semi - implicit method that is based on a non - local ( in time ) representation of the non - linear density dependent biomass flux is described in @xcite .",
    "this method can be efficiently parallelised for shared memory architectures @xcite and has been used for several extensions and applications of the underlying biofilm model @xcite .",
    "this low order method has shown to be robust and to handle the steep biomass gradients at the biofilm / water interface reasonably well .",
    "this method has also been studied and used for a variant of the biofilm model with a slightly different biomass diffusion coefficient in @xcite .",
    "minor adaptations and extensions of this approach were suggested in @xcite , however without major documented improvement .",
    "a related fully - implicit first order time integration method was proposed in @xcite for a cellulosic biofilm system in which nutrients are stationary and do not diffuse .",
    "it uses a fixed - point iteration at each time - step to solve the resulting non - linear system .",
    "this method reduces to the semi - implicit approach of @xcite as a special case if only one iteration step is carried out . in @xcite",
    "the trapezoidal rule was used for time integration in the spatially one - dimensional case and explicit variants were proposed in @xcite , however , without demonstrated gain .",
    "all these methods use fixed time steps and because of the low regularity of the solution they do not possess error control properties for time integration . choosing the time step such that an acceptable trade - off between accuracy and compute time is achieved , and that a breakdown of the method near the super - diffusion singularity is avoided , requires some user experience .    in this paper",
    "we want to overcome the constraints around time integration .",
    "our problem at hand has two sources of stiffness .",
    "one stems from the disparity of characteristic time scales of substrate diffusion and uptake on one hand , and biomass growth on the other hand @xcite .",
    "the other one comes into play when the biomass density approaches the super - diffusion singularity . for stiff ordinary differential equations with sufficiently smooth solutions , a host of such methods exists . due to the singularity in the biomass diffusion coefficient and the resulting missing regularity of solutions",
    ", it is not _ a priori _ clear whether these can be applied for the time integration of the biofilm equation .",
    "furthermore , it will be important that the resulting numerical scheme is able to deal with sharp biomass gradients at the biofilm / water interface without introducing spurious oscillation or extensive interface smearing . to address these questions , and to propose a fully adaptive method for time integration of the biofilm model is our main objective .",
    "we will demonstrate the utility of this method by studying a question that arises in the context of quorum sensing in biofilms .",
    "bacterial cells produce and secret chemical signals to communicate with each other , and measure the concentration of the signal molecule in their environment .",
    "this mechanism is known as quorum sensing .",
    "once a critical signal concentration is reached , changes in gene expressions are induced and bacteria collectively synchronize their behaviour @xcite .",
    "as the producer cells respond to their own signal they are sometimes referred to as autoinducers ( e.g. , acyl - homoserine lactones ( ahl ) in gram - negative bacteria ) . in most bacterial autoinducer systems ,",
    "the autoinducer synthase gene is upregulated , i.e a positive feedback stimulus is induced , leading to production of ahl molecules at an increased rate @xcite .    the name quorum sensing stems from an interpretation of autoinduction as a mechanism to estimate cell density .",
    "however , in environments that are not completely mixed , such as spatially structured biofilm systems , the autoinducer concentration is affected by transport of chemical signals in the aqueous environment .",
    "as bacteria can not estimate any of the transportation process independently , they can not correct their estimate of cell density to account for these factors .",
    "in fact they might use the autoinducer concentration as an estimate of any of the factors that can affect the concentration of this molecule , such as diffusion limitation @xcite .",
    "this has lead to the interpretation of quorum sensing as diffusion sensing and a mechanism to survey the environment @xcite .",
    "an important question to ask is then how the environment affects the time to autoinduction in a biofilm colony , and the size of the colony that is required for autoinduction , i.e. for the signal concentration to exceed induction threshold .    in a recent study",
    "@xcite it was investigated experimentally using a synthetic biofilm matrix and mathematically using a simple diffusion model , how much autoinducer needs to be added instantaneously in a colony center to achieve concentrations in the biofilm above induction threshold for different colony sizes .",
    "our goal is to build on this using a model that accounts also for biofilm growth and dynamic autoinducer production , and considers diffusion of signal molecules into the environment .",
    "a related , older study is @xcite , where the relationship between biofilm size and induction was studied in a one - dimensional setting , using a wanner - gujer type biofilm growth model .",
    "the 1d setting in that study , however , is limiting in that it does not allow to investigate effects of signal diffusion parallel to the substratum , and thus effects of neighboring colonies or confined domains .",
    "how convective transport of signal molecules due to bulk flow hydrodynamics affects washout of autoinducers and the onset of induction in narrow flow channels , on the other hand , was simulated in @xcite ; the presence of background flow added another complexity that does not allow to hone in on aspects of diffusion sensing .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ mathmodel ] we introduce the prototype biofilm model and obtain its semi - discrete version by applying a finite volume method to discretize the partial differential equation in space . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we analyse the semi - discrete model ; in particular we show , using regularization and the method of super and sub solutions , that the solution of the resulting ode never attains the singularity and is thus sufficiently smooth to apply standard numerical methods for time integration , such as embedded rosenbrock - wanner methods , which we will use . in order to demonstrate that the resulting numerical method is able to handle gradient blow - up at the biofilm / water interface",
    ", we apply in section [ sec4 ] the numerical scheme to a simpler problem ( without super - diffusion singularity ) , for which an exact solution is known , namely the porous medium equation with linear growth . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we investigate the behaviour of our numerical method for the full prototype biofilm growth model .",
    "in particular we give a grid refinement study and explore quantitatively the dependence of the numerical method on the regularization parameter that was introduced for analytical treatment . in section",
    "[ ds ] , finally we present an illustrative application of the method in the context of quorum sensing . concluding remarks are provided in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the mathematical model studied in this paper was originally introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is formulated as a density - dependent degenerate diffusion - reaction equation over domain @xmath1 .",
    "the dependent variables are the volume fraction occupied by biomass , @xmath2 , and the concentration of a growth limiting nutrient , @xmath3 .",
    "domain @xmath4 is divided into region @xmath5 that describes the aquatic phase ( bulk liquid , channels and pores of a biofilm ) without biomass , and region @xmath6 , which is the actual biofilm with positive density , cf .",
    "figure [ figbio2 ] .     with liquid region @xmath7 and biofilm region @xmath8 .",
    "]    the independent variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote here time and spatial location , respectively .",
    "both regions are separated by the biofilm / water interface @xmath11 which changes as the biofilm grows , i.e. as @xmath2 changes .    as is usual in mathematical models of biofilms , the eps that is produced by the bacteria is subsumed in the biofilm volume fraction in this prototype biofilm model .",
    "an extension of this model that accounts for eps explicitly has been proposed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the model in non - dimensionalised form reads @xcite : @xmath12 @xmath13 is a density - dependent diffusion coefficient defined as : @xmath14 diffusion coefficient @xmath13 shows two non - linear effects : ( i ) a power law degeneracy as in the porous medium equation , i.e. @xmath13 vanishes as @xmath2 vanishes and ( ii ) a super diffusion singularity as @xmath2 approaches to unity .",
    "the porous medium degeneracy , @xmath15 , guarantees that the biofilm does not spread notably if the biomass density is small , @xmath16 , and it is also responsible for the formation of a sharp interface between biofilm and surrounding liquid , i.e. initial data with compact support lead to solutions with compact support . the second effect ( ii )",
    "enforces the solution to be bounded by unity @xcite . this is counteracted by the degeneracy as @xmath17 at the interface .",
    "consequently , @xmath2 squeezes in the biofilm region and approaches its maximum value 1 .",
    "hence , the interaction of both non - linear diffusion effects with the growth term is needed to describe spatial biomass spreading @xcite .",
    "diffusion of the dissolved nutrient is assumed to be fickian , i.e. @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "biomass spreading is much slower than diffusion of dissolved substrate , thus the biomass motility coefficient , @xmath19 , is several orders of magnitude smaller than the substrate diffusion coefficient .    in ( [ 21 ] ) , parameter @xmath20 is the cell lysis rate , @xmath21 the monod half saturation concentration , and @xmath22 the maximum substrate uptake rate .    to study the mathematical model ( [ 21 ] ) we restrict ourselves to the rectangular domain @xmath23\\times[0,h]$ ] .",
    "the substratum , on which biofilm colonies form is the bottom boundary , @xmath24 .",
    "we assume the substratum is impermeable to biomass and dissolved substrate . at the lateral boundaries , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we assume a symmetry boundary condition for both dependent variables , which allows us to view the domain as a part of a continuously repeating larger domain . at the top boundary , @xmath27",
    ", we pose a homogeneous dirichlet condition for the biomass and a robin condition for the nutrient which reflects that the substrate is added to the system through this segment of the domain boundary .",
    "thus the imposed boundary conditions on domain @xmath23\\times[0,h]$ ] are defined as : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the concentration boundary layer thickness , and @xmath30 denotes the outward normal derivative .",
    "the concentration boundary layer is introduced to mimic the convective contribution of external bulk flow to substrate supply , i.e. it is related to the bulk flow velocity , in the sense that a small bulk flow velocity implies a thick concentration boundary layer , while a thin concentration boundary layer represents fast bulk flow @xcite .",
    "for the reader s convenience we recall the main result of @xcite that studies the longtime behaviour of pde model ( [ 21 ] ) without proof :    [ pdeexist : thm ] let the initial data @xmath31 satisfy the conditions @xmath32 where @xmath33[27 ] then , there exists a solution @xmath34 of degenerate problem ( [ 21 ] ) ( in the sense of distributions ) belonging to the following class : @xmath35    [ pdeunique : thm ] let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be two solutions of ( [ 21 ] ) belonging to the class ( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "then , the following estimate is valid : @xmath38 in particular , the solution of ( [ 21 ] ) is unique in the class ( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "an extension of these results to more general boundary conditions is described in @xcite .",
    "we introduce a uniform grid of size @xmath39 for the rectangular domain @xmath40\\times [ 0,h]$ ] . integrating the first equations of ( [ 21 ] ) over each grid cell and using the divergence theorem yields @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the domain of the cell with grid index @xmath43 , @xmath44 denotes the outward normal flux across the grid cell boundary , and @xmath45 stands for the reaction terms .",
    "to evaluate the area integrals in ( [ fvm : eq ] ) , we evaluate the dependent variables at the center of the grid cells , @xmath46 and similarly for the nutrient concentration @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 and approximate the integral by the midpoint rule .",
    "similarly , the line integral in ( [ fvm : eq ] ) is evaluated by considering every edge of the grid cell separately using the midpoint rule . to this end",
    ", the diffusion coefficient @xmath13 in the midpoint of the cell edge is approximated by arithmetic averaging from the neighbouring grid cell center points , and the derivative of @xmath2 across the cell edge by a central finite difference .",
    "we get then for the biomass density in the grid cell center the ordinary differential equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 and for the fluxes we have , accounting for the boundary conditions , @xmath53",
    "@xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56    the spatial discretization of the equation for the nutrient follows the same principle , with the major difference being that at the top of the domain we have a robin boundary condition instead of homogeneous dirichlet condition . that @xmath18 is constant simplifies the flux expressions .",
    "we have then @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62    by introducing the lexicographical grid ordering @xmath63 and the vector notation @xmath64 , @xmath65 with @xmath66 , @xmath67 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , we arrive at the coupled system of @xmath68 ordinary differential equations @xmath69    [ rem1 ] by construction the @xmath70 matrices @xmath71 are symmetric , and weakly diagonally dominant with non - positive main diagonals and non - negative off - diagonals . they contain the spatial derivative terms .",
    "they can efficiently be stored in sparse diagonal format with 4 off - diagonals , with offsets @xmath72 . the matrices @xmath73 are diagonal matrices which contain the reaction terms ; in particular the @xmath74th entry in @xmath75 vanishes if @xmath76 .",
    "the vector @xmath77 contains contributions from the robin boundary conditions in ( [ bctopc : eq ] ) ; its entries are zero for all grid cells @xmath43 with @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for grid points with @xmath80 .",
    "the discretization can easily be extended to more general boundary conditions , such as robin conditions everywhere , in analogy to ( [ bctopc : eq ] ) .",
    "due to the singularity in the biomass diffusion coefficient ( [ 22 ] ) standard arguments from the theory for ordinary differential equations , such as the picard - lindelf theorem and the tangent condition can not be readily applied to study the well - posedness of the ode system ( [ 220 ] ) and to prove that the biomass volume fraction @xmath81 is indeed bounded by unity , as is required for physical reasons and for agreement with the underlying pde ( [ 21 ] ) , as per theorem [ pdeexist : thm ] . to overcome this limitation",
    "we regularize the semi - discretised system .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce the regularised density - dependent biomass diffusion coefficient @xmath82 and define the following regularised version of ode system ( [ 220 ] ) , @xmath83 where matrix @xmath84 is defined like @xmath85 , only with @xmath86 in the flux terms ( [ 210a])-([uflux4:eq ] ) replaced by ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "the regularised semi - discretised system ( [ 31 ] ) is a standard , 2nd order ( in space ) convergent , finite difference approximation of the regularised partial differential equation system @xmath87 the solutions of which are smooth .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the solutions of the initial value problem of ( [ regpde : eq ] ) converge to the solution of the corresponding initial value problem of ( [ 21 ] ) as @xmath88 , and that @xmath89 for some @xmath90 and sufficiently small @xmath91 .",
    "going forward , we define vector inequalities component wise , i.e for two vectors @xmath92 and @xmath93 the inequality @xmath94 means @xmath95 for all @xmath96 , and accordingly for strict inequalities .",
    "furthermore , by @xmath97 we denote the unity vector @xmath98 , and by @xmath99 we denote the vector @xmath100 .",
    "we show that the initial value problem of ( [ 31 ] ) with initial data for @xmath101 and @xmath102 such that @xmath103 and @xmath104 possesses a unique solution that is non - negative and bounded .",
    "[ pro1 ] let @xmath105 .",
    "suppose the initial values @xmath106 and @xmath107 of the regularized ode system ( [ 31 ] ) are non - negative and satisfy @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "then there exists a unique solution @xmath111 of the regularized problem ( [ 31 ] ) , which is non - negative and bounded by a constant for sufficiently small values of @xmath91 . also , an upper bound on the solution exists that does not depend on the regularization parameter @xmath91 .",
    "the semi - discrete system ( [ 31 ] ) satisfies the lipschitz condition in the non - negative cone .",
    "therefore , the initial value problem has a unique solution .",
    "non - negativity of this solution follows with standard arguments , such as the tangent condition ( cf @xcite ) , from the properties of matrices @xmath112 as per remark [ rem1 ] .",
    "that @xmath113 follows with the non - negativity of @xmath114 from the definitions of @xmath115 again from the tangent condition .    to show the boundedness of @xmath116 we introduce the barrier function @xmath117 , where the vector @xmath118 is the solution of the linear system @xmath119 with @xmath120",
    "note that this matrix @xmath121 does not depend on @xmath91 , whence also @xmath118 is independent of @xmath91 .    by construction , @xmath121 is uniquely invertible and weakly diagonally dominant with positive main diagonal entries and negative off - diagonal entries",
    ". therefore , it is an m - matrix @xcite .",
    "hence its inverse exists and is non - negative , which implies the non - negativity of @xmath122 thus , @xmath123 for some positive vector @xmath124 .",

    "we have the following relationship between @xmath114 and @xmath143 :    [ 1:lem ] let @xmath143 be the solution of ( [ veps ] ) and @xmath114 be the solution of ( [ 31 ] ) with initial data @xmath137 .",

    "hence , more biomass is needed to have induction , therefore the time at which qs induction occurs increases .",
    "we also observe that times @xmath323 are very similar but there is a considerable difference between them and @xmath324 especially in the large domains .",
    "it takes more time to have @xmath325 for all @xmath326 in a large domain because more signal molecules diffuse , which delays @xmath327 as @xmath322 increases .",

    "@xmath318 , increasing the length of the domain enhances the total value of biomass .",
    "increasing the domain length increases mass transfer thus more biomass is needed for differentiation i.e. @xmath329 increases . mirroring the differences between @xmath330 and @xmath327 , figure",
    "[ figdiff].b shows considerable difference between total biomass at @xmath323 and its value at @xmath327 .",
    "time course of total biomass for @xmath331 is shown in figure [ figdiff].c to show the effect of the length of the domain on the required biomass for qs induction vs time .",
    "we observe that initially the values of total biomass in all four systems are the same and deviation emerges at @xmath332 .",
    "we also observe that @xmath329 in the system with @xmath333 has the maximum value indicating the maximum mass transfer occurs in the system with largest domain .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that the value of @xmath327 which is in fact the time at which simulation stops is increasing by increasing the length of computational domain as we have shown in figure [ figdiff].a .",
    "the simulation results in figure [ figdiff].a , b , suggest that @xmath319s and @xmath320 change with respect to the system length quadratically .",
    "this is confirmed by fitting a quadratic function to our data points , @xmath334 and @xmath335 , which are also included in the plots .",
    "the coefficients @xmath336 and @xmath337 are given in table [ tablefitt ] .",

    "we observe that @xmath343 indicating the error between the predicted value of @xmath344 and obtained data is less than the error between the predicted and real values of @xmath319 .      in agreement with earlier studies",
    "@xcite our results show that upregulation is rapid . in our simulations ,",
    "the time between the signal concentration first reaching the switching threshold somewhere in the colony and until the switching threshold is exceeded in the colony everywhere is very short , about 1% of the induction time .",
    "our simulations suggest that the environment and the physical conditions there affect the time to induction for single isolated colonies .",
    "this is to a large extent determined by mass transfer of signals from the colony into the surrounding aqueous phase , and transport of signal molecules there . in our simulations",
    "we have neglected abiotic decay of signal molecules in the aqueous phase , but it is to conjecture that including such an effect would exacerbate this phenomenon .",
    "this suggests that upregulation of an individual colony is not a mere function of colony size , in accordance with @xcite .",
    "a related , but not directly comparable study in this regard is @xcite , where a one - dimensional model was used to determine the minimum thickness required for a homogeneous biofilm layer to induce . in that study the aqueous phase was not explicitly considered , but the diffusive flux of signal molecules from the colony in direction of the bulk phase is specified as a boundary condition .",
    "this , in our setting would correspond to changing the depth of the cavity , which we kept constant .",
    "in contrast to this , we varied the lateral extension of the domain , showing that also horizontal mass transfer , orthogonal to the main diffusion direction matters .",
    "on the other hand , if we understand the lateral homogeneous neumann conditions as symmetry conditions instead of as no - flux conditions , then we can interpret our system also as an infinite array of equidistantly spaced identical colonies .",
    "our system then models a biofilm community consisting of many individual colonies .",
    "system length @xmath322 is then the distance between the centers of 2 consecutive colonies , i.e. the smaller @xmath322 , the more biomass in the biofilm . from the viewpoint of the entire biofilm community our results confirm the traditional interpretation of quorum sensing , i.e. induction takes place when the population reaches a certain size .",
    "we can reconcile this with the findings discussed above by the observation that the horizontal signal fluxes between two neighbouring colonies cancel each other , i.e. the net flux between neighbouring colonies is zero .",
    "again this confirms the important role of signal diffusion .",
    "our primary objective was to study a time - adaptive , error - controlled numerical solution strategy for a non - linear degenerate diffusion system that arises in biofilm modelling .",
    "this system has two non - linear effects ( i ) porous medium degeneracy for @xmath345 and ( ii ) super - diffusion singularity for @xmath346 , which make this problem difficult to treat numerically and analytically .",
    "by regularisation we showed that a semi - discrete ( continuous in time , discrete in space ) approximation of this highly non - linear pde satisfies a lipschitz condition , i.e. has classical smooth solutions which allows the application of traditional time - adaptive , error controlled time integration techniques .",
    "this allows to overcome the limitations of previous semi - implict and fully - implicit methods for the biofilm model that required fixed , _ a priori _ determined time - steps .",
    "the numerical solution renders the important features of the original pde , such as a finite speed of propagation of the biofilm / water interface , blow - up of the biomass gradient at the interface , non - negativity of the solution and strict boundedness by unity .    in an application of the numerical method to a quorum sensing system we showed that also secondary horizontal signal transport , orthogonal to the main diffusion direction , has on effect on the time of induction in a biofilm colony . +",
