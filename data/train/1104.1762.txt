    "the thickness implies that @xmath125 and so @xmath43 are preserved . to prove theorem [ th : main ] , we want to imitate serre s proof of theorem [ th : serrelcft ] .",
    "this gives rise to two problems .",
    "one problem is that the exactness of a sequence in @xmath124 is not always determined by the exactness of the sequence induced on the groups of @xmath90-points .",
    "we deal with this by defining tate cohomology not as groups but as sheaves ( section [ sec : tate ] ) and giving one situation where @xmath90-points have enough information ( proposition [ prop : tate ] )",
    ". then we can convert the vanishing result of tate cohomology groups into that of tate cohomology sheaves ( proposition [ prop : vanish ] ) .",
    "the other problem is that , for a finite extension of complete discrete valuation fields @xmath62 with residue extension @xmath126 , we need to regard the group of units and the multiplicative group of @xmath65 as sheaves in several different ways , some of which defined on @xmath123 and others on @xmath127 .",
    "these are sheaf versions of the groups defined at ( * ? ? ?",

    "of course this is not the only way to formulate and obtain the same theorem or its equivalent .",
    "several different approaches will be possible .",
    "nevertheless , the authors believe that the way we take here is at least one of the most standard ways .",
