    "usually , in @xmath4 dimensional conservative systems regular islands ( kolmogorov - arnold - moser kam tori ) can break as the perturbation parameter increases , and chaotic trajectories may coexist with regular islands @xcite .",
    "this regime is called quasiregular .",
    "chaotic trajectories may be trapped around stable islands creating `` sticky '' motion ( for a review see  @xcite ) . in such cases",
    "the dynamics in phase space can be very structured and the motion is non - ergodic .",
    "analytical results for physical quantities in the quasiregular regime are rare and it is very desirable to obtain tools which quantify degrees of ergodicity and hyperbolicity , as for example the angle between the stable and unstable manifolds obtained via the covariant lyapunov vectors @xcite .",

    "( b ) and ( c ) are magnifications from the boxes shown in ( a).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=77.0% ]    hence , the question arises how these tiny regular islands can be identified with not more information than provided by fig .",

    "in fact , for @xmath7 dimensional conservative systems , due to arnold diffusion , the kam surfaces do not divide the whole phase space into a set of closed volumes .",
    "although the effect of stickiness of @xmath8-dimensional invariant tori has been analyzed for the asymptotic decay of correlations and anomalous diffusion @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , the behavior of sticky trajectories in higher - dimensional systems has never been quantified and explored systematically .    in the following we present extensive numerical simulations to detect and quantify sticky motion in the phase space of quasiregular and chaotic conservative systems with up to 20 dimensions .",
    "to fulfill this task we analyze small changes in the finite time lyapunov exponents ( ftle ) distribution using four quantities : the variance @xmath9 , the skewness @xmath10 , the kurtosis @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the normalized number of occurencies of the most probable finite time lyapunov exponent .",
    "the first three quantities were analyzed in the two - dimensional standard map for the distribution of the finite time stability exponents to detect islands @xcite and to study the fluctuations of the mean ftle for specific trajectories and the corresponding kolmogorov like entropy @xcite .",
    "the ftles are the average of local divergence of trajectories and for ergodic systems they converge to the le obtained in the limit of infinite times , which is independent of initial conditions  @xcite . in such cases",
    "the ftle distribution has gaussian form ( normal distribution ) @xcite .",
    "however , in quasiregular systems the chaotic trajectories may visit the neighborhood of regular islands , being trapped there for a while , and the ftles do not converge quite well .",
    "such small changes in the ftles distribution can be used for many purposes : to obtain information about algebraic or exponential stretching in phase space @xcite , to quantify ergodicity @xcite , to study stretching processes in chaotic flows @xcite , to detect the bimodal @xcite or multimodal @xcite behavior of the local ftles , to analyze the time correlations @xcite and poincar recurrence @xcite in coupled maps , to detect the sticky motion @xcite and the arise of regular islands @xcite for interacting particles in one- and two - dimensional billiards via @xmath12 and , as we will see here , to detect and quantify sticky motion in higher - dimensional nonintegrable conservative systems .",
    "in addition , ftles have been used in dissipative systems to distinguish between strange chaotic and nonchaotic attractors ( see @xcite for some examples ) . in these cases the trajectory switches between long times on the periodic attractor ( negative ftle ) and smaller times on the chaotic saddle with positive ftles .",
    "this is quite the opposite of what is observed in conservative chaotic systems , where the trajectory evolves for longer times in the chaotic region of the phase space and smaller times near the regular island .",
    "in contrast to the large literature related to the analysis of sticky motion via the distribution of the _ local _",
    "ftles for some specific trajectories and as a function of time , in this work we analyze the ftles distribution _ after _",
    "@xmath13 iteration of the map and over @xmath14 initial conditions distributed uniformly in phase space .",
    "our investigations show that even for such large times the ftles still depend on initial conditions when sticky motion is present .",
    "such times are large enough to give a good convergence of the ftles and to detect the sticky motion .",
    "if the iteration times increase too much ( @xmath15 ) , effects of sticky motion on the distribution start to dissapear since for infinite times the distribution approaches the @xmath16function in chaotic systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the properties of the variance @xmath9 and the distribution of the most probable lyapunov exponent @xmath12 for a two - dimensional conservative system ( the standard map ) and compare them with higher cummulants ( @xmath17 and @xmath11 ) . in section",

    "this map locally approximates more general nonlinear mappings @xcite .",
    "the ftle spectrum is determined numerically for a conservative system using bennetin s algorithm @xcite which includes the gram - schmidt re - orthonormalization procedure .",

    "the _ local _ ftle decreases and consequently the final @xmath36 also decreases . in such cases",
    "the ftle distribution is not gaussian anymore but contains interesting information about the dynamics .",
    "figure [ mp]a also reveals that for some specific values of @xmath2 the amount of sticky trajectories changes , which will be quantified and characterized next .",
    "note , that such information is not provided by the mean ftle shown in fig .  [ mp]b .      clearly , anomalies in the ftle distribution reflect sticky motion - however , the entire distribution is not a convenient tool to identify and measure sticky motion .",

    "we will analyze the properties of the    relative variance    @xmath42 which is    more appropriate for higher - dimensional systems .",

    "these four quantities will be used to characterize the degree of sticky motion in the transition from low- to higher - dimensional systems .",
    "altogether they should give all relevant informations which can be extracted from the distributions .      to compare with the higher dimensional cases to be discussed",

    "[ n1]c ) and kurtosis ( fig .",

    "it is well known that the dynamics of conservative systems consists of qualitatively different types of motion , from regular over quasi - regular to chaotic , depending on the perturbation parameter .",
    "it is difficult to identify these types of motion in high - dimensional systems , especially in the quasi - regular regime where the sticky motion can suppress arnold diffusion and distinct stochastic regions with different properties may appear @xcite .",

    "following ideas from @xcite the purpose of the present work is to quantify the degree of sticky motion in the phase space of higher - dimensional systems . to fulfill this task",
    "we have systematically analyzed small changes in the ftle distributions using the skewness @xmath10 , which detects the asymmetry of the distribution , the kurtosis @xmath11 , which measures the flatness of the distribution and the normalized number of occurencies of the most probable finite time lyapunov exponent @xmath12 , which indicates to which extent all trajectories started are under the influence of the same ftle .    using coupled conservative maps with nonlinearity parameter @xmath2",

    "for very small values of @xmath2 and higher dimensions , the large amount of invariant structures make trajectories stay almost all times at the sticky motion . in such cases it is hard to say what times should be used in general . besides detecting accurately all cases of sticky motion , we found the following additional interesting results : i ) ( @xmath191 ) the largest ftle is most sensitive to the sticky motion ; ii ) ( @xmath3 ) the smallest ftle defines the critical nonlinearity parameter @xmath152 , below which independent invariant regions in phase - space are expected and @xmath192 behaves nonlinearly .",

    "simultaneously _ in all unstable directions . in the interval @xmath155 all quantities detect the presence of sticky motion and distributions for _ different _ ftles behave _ similarly _ , meaning that the sticky motion affects all unstable directions proportionally by the same amount and a kind of common behavior of the distributions is observed .",
    "physically what happens is that the linear momentum of _ all _ sites is constant at the sticky motion .",
