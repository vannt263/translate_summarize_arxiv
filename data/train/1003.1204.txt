    "gene trees are fundamental to molecular systematics .",
    "traditionally , a gene tree is reconstructed from dna sequence variation at individual genetic loci in a group of species and is taken as the phylogenetic tree of the species due to sequencing technology limitations . however , when gene copies are sampled from various species , the resulting gene tree might disagree with the species tree .",
    "as such , the relationship between gene trees and species trees has been the focus of many studies ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it has long been recognized that gene trees can be used to estimate species divergence time , ancestral population sizes and even the containing species tree although they may not accurately reflect the species tree @xcite .",
    "the discord of gene trees and the containing species tree can arise from horizontal gene transfer , lineage sorting , and gene duplication and loss .",
    "the importance of these causes depends on the considered genes and species .",
    "hence , inferring the species tree from gene trees has been investigated under various parsimony criteria . with lineage sorting ( also called deep coalescence ) , the problem is to find the tree minimizing extra gene lineages that had to coexist along species lineages @xcite ; with gene duplication , it becomes to find the tree minimizing gene duplications and/or losses @xcite .",
    "inferring the species tree from a set of gene trees has often been studied under the gene duplication cost @xcite until very recently . in a seminal work @xcite ,",
    "maddison addressed lineage sorting in the framework of coalescence theory .",
    "coalescence theory is an active branch of population genetics concerned with tracing the genealogical history of a present - day gene copy . for a gene sampled from two individuals , one may ask : how deep in time do these two lineages coalesce ?",
    "hence , the depth of this coalescence is a measure of the relationship between two sampled gene copies .",
    "the more deep in time coalescence occurs , the more distantly related they are .",
    "maddison proposed to use the total number of  extra \" gene lineages that fails to coalesce on a species tree to measure the inconsistence of a gene tree and species tree , called _ deep coalescence cost_. for the gene tree and species tree shown in figure  [ dcexample ] , there are three gene lineages on a branch and two gene lineages on another branch that fail to coalesce , giving the deep coalescence cost of 3 . since coalescence theory provides the probability that a gene tree would exist in a species tree , it allows the inference problem to be studied in explicit statistical framework @xcite .",
    "this seems to give the deep coalescence model an advantage over the other models .",
    "the paper is a sequel of @xcite , which studies the complexity and algorithmic issues of inferring the species tree from a set of gene trees with the gene duplication / loss cost . in this work",
    ", we present a relationship of the deep coalescence cost , the duplication cost , and the number of gene losses .",
    "although deep coalescence and gene duplication are two different mechanisms responsible for the discord of gene trees and species trees , this relationship suggests that the deep coalescence cost and the duplication cost are closely related to each other as a similarity measure of trees .",
    "we further show that inferring species tree from gene trees is also np - hard by minimizing the deep coalescence cost .     , scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "in this section , we shall introduce basic definitions and notations on gene duplication , gene loss and deep coalescence that are used in the following sections .      for a set of @xmath0 taxa",
