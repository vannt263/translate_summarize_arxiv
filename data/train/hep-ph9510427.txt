    "massive electrodynamics is electrodynamics in which the photon has a small mass gev or even @xmath0 gev , but the existence of such a bound is not important for the purposes of this paper , so we do not go into detail here . ] rather than being exactly massless .",
    "it is perhaps the simplest and the most straightforward extension of the standard quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "it can be embedded into the standard @xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "although the introduction of a small photon mass may look unaesthetical , in some respects massive qed is simpler theoretically than the standard theory .",
    "for example , massive qed can be quantized in a manifestly lorentz - covariant way without introducing the indefinite metric while the standard qed can not . also , the analysis of infrared properties of massive qed is easier because there are no infrared singularities caused by the zero photon mass .",
    "note that although the photon is massive in the theory under consideration , the electric charge is strictly conserved in massive qed as well as in standard qed . from the experimenatal point of view ,",
    "massive qed is as perfect as standard qed .    in massive qed",
    "the photon has three polarization states : two transverse ones and one longitudinal . despite this fact",
    ", it has been shown that the limiting transition between both theories is in fact smooth rather than discontinuous @xcite .",
    "the physical reason is that the interaction of longitudinal photons gets weaker as the photon mass tends to zero so that in the massless limit they effectively decouple .",
    "such smoothness may even be elevated to a role of an important theoretical principle : each physical phenomenon which can be described in standard qed must have its counterpart description in massive qed ; the two descriptions must merge continuously in the limit of vanishing photon mass .    independently of whether this conjecture is true or not , it is instructive to see how it works ( or fails ) in various physical contexts since in this way a better understanding of the physical situation can arise .    with this aspect in view , it is natural to consider those phenomena , for which the gauge invariance of qed is crucial or at least essential .",
    "one example is the dirac monopole @xcite .",
    "although there have been much work devoted to various sides of magnetic monopole physics , the aspect we are interested in has not been analyzed in detail so far .    the purpose of the present paper is to try and fill that gap . in other words",
    ", we would like to know if magnetic monopoles and massive photons can coexist within one and the same theory .",
    "we know that the very existence of dirac monopole is tightly connected with the existence of gauge invariance of qed . in massive qed , there is no gauge invariance anymore .",
    "so , the question is : what happens to magnetic monopoles there ?",
    "do they survive the loss of gauge invariance ?    before starting any reasoning , we could just try to guess the right answer . obviously , it has to be either `` yes '' or `` no '' .",
    "let us consider these in turn .    at first sight , the positive answer does not look impossible at all . we know that with the introduction of photon mass the electrostatic field changes from the usual coulomb form , @xmath2 , to the yukawa form @xmath3",
    "so , we would expect the magnetic field of a monopole also to change from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "however , what would happen to the dirac quantization cony of melbourne , the magnitude of the photon mass and vanishing smoothly with the vanishing photon mass ? or should the quantization condition remain the same in both theories ?",
    "next , how can we make sure the string is unobservable if we do not have gauge invariance ?    now , if we guess that there can be no monopoles in massive qed , then again there arise several questions .",
    "what about rotational invariance ?",
    "we know that the dirac quantization condition can be obtained from rotational invariance and angular momentum quantization @xcite without using gauge invariance .",
    "can we generalize that kind of arguments to the case of massive qed ?",
    "next , what about the limit of vanishing photon mass ?",
    "if magnetic monopoles abruptly disappear when photon mass equals zero , then , how can we make a continuous transition between the massive and massless qed ?",
    "so it seems that both `` yes '' and `` no '' options offer interesting questions to ponder on .",
    "our startegy in this paper will be as follows .",
    "first we write down the classical maxwell equations describing the magnetic charge and massive photon .",
    "we then find the solutions which would go into the dirac monopole solution in the limit of vanishing photon mass ( section ii ) . at this stage",
    "no inconsistency arise , but no genuine monopoles either , because we have of course the string attached to the monopole .",
    "in the spirit of dirac s approach we then turn to quantum mechanics in our efforts to eliminate the mischievous string .",
    "we undertake this step in section iii by plugging the solution found in section ii into the shrdinger equation describing the interaction between the the magnetic charge and the electron .",
    "after that , we try to derive the dirac quantization condition for our case .",
    "since gauge invariance is lost in massive electrodynamics , we use the method of angular momentum algebra @xcite , generalized to the case of non - vanishing photon mass . under rather general assumptions",
    "we prove a theorem that the construction of such an algebra is not possible and therefore the quantization condition can not be derived .",
    "this points to the conclusion that the dirac monopole and the finite photon mass can not coexist within one and the same theory .",
    "some physical consequences of this conclusion , including the problem of continuity , are discussed at a qualitative level in section iv . the case of thooft - polyakov monopole",
    "is touched upon briefly at the end of the paper .",
    "we start by writing down the proca equation describing electrodynamics with finite range ( or equivalently with a non - zero photon mass ) . ] :    [ a ] @xmath6    where , the field strength @xmath7 is connected with the 4-vector potential @xmath8 the usual way :    @xmath9    the dual pseudo ",
    "tensor @xmath10 is defined as usual via    @xmath11 @xmath12 is the ( electric ) current density .",
    "next , the maxwell equations generalized to include magnetic charge are :    [ b ] @xmath13    where index @xmath14 denotes the magnetic current density .    now the straightforward generalization of systems ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) reads    [ c ] @xmath15    let us rewrite this system in the 3dimensional form :    [ d ]",
    "@xmath16    this is the system of generalized maxwell equations which would presumably describe the existence of both magnetic charge and non - zero photon mass .",
    "a few remarks are now in order .    1 .",
    "the photon mass term @xmath17 in the right - hand side of maxwell equations violates the symmetry between the electric and magnetic charges .",
    "this is clearly seen from the comparison of eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d3 ] ) : the `` electric '' equation ( [ d1 ] has as its solution the familiar yukawa potential + @xmath18 while the `` magnetic '' equation ( [ d3 ] ) does not feel the photon mass at all .",
    "the gauge invariance is completely lost due to the photon mass term .",
    "indeed , it can be seen that the transformation @xmath19 is inconsistent with equations ( [ a ] ) whatever the function @xmath20 is .",
    "( recall that the ordinary maxwell equations in the lorentz gauge , @xmath21 , also do not allow gauge transformation with the arbitrary function @xmath20 .",
    "however , these equations allow such transformations for @xmath20 satisfying the condition @xmath22 . in our case , even that restricted gauge invariance is lost . )",
    "note that this loss of invariance has occurred already at the stage of the proca equations without magnetic charge and so it has nothing to do with the introduction of magnetic charge .",
    "3 .   due to the loss of gauge invariance ,",
    "the vector potential @xmath8 becomes observable quantity on the same footing as the field strength @xmath23 .",
    "it can be seen that the presence of photon mass term @xmath24 in the righthand side of the equation of ( [ d4 ] ) creates a sort of additional current density , in addition to the usual electric current @xmath25 4 .",
    "it is not immediately obvious that the loss of gauge invariance destroys the consistency of the dirac monopole theory and the validity of the quantization condition .",
    "for example , the aharonov - bohm effect which is also based on the electromagnetic gauge invariance , has been shown to survive in the massive electrodynamics despite the absence of gauge invariance there @xcite .",
    "our modified maxwell equations tell us that there arises the additional magnetic field created by the `` potential - current '' @xmath24 .",
    "there is no way to separate this additional magnetic field from the normal one .",
    "although in proca theory ( without magnetic charge ) this circumstance does not cause any problems , it becomes the main source of trouble once magnetic charges are added to the massive electrodynamics , as we shall see shortly .",
    "after these general remarks , let us see if our system of `` maxwell + photon mass + magnetic charge '' equations ( [ d ] ) is consistent or not .",
    "let us try to find a static monopole - like solution of that system .",
    "for this purpose , we assume the absence of electric fields , charges and currents ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) as well as the absence of magnetic current ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we then are left essentially with four equations    [ e ] @xmath31    the first equation has the familiar dirac monopole solution :    [ f ] @xmath32    as is well known , this solution involves a singularity in vector potential along the line @xmath33 ( `` a string '' ) . yet",
    "this singularity was shown by dirac to be only a nuisance without any physical significance .",
    "now if we plug this dirac solution ( or , more exactly , the coulomb magnetic field ) into the second equation , we immediately run into trouble , because clearly @xmath34 , instead of being equal to @xmath35 .",
    "let us try to find a better solution by adding something to the dirac solution .",
    "in this way we write : @xmath36 where the rotor and the divergence of the additional field @xmath37 must satisfy @xmath38 @xmath39 while the divergence of the potential @xmath40 must vanish : @xmath41 because @xmath42 finally , @xmath43    now , we have the complete system of equations ( [ eq:8 ] ) through ( [ eq:11 ] ) for the rotors and divergences of both @xmath37 and @xmath40 .",
    "let us see if there is any solution to it .",
    "taking the rotor of both sides of eqn.([eq:11 ] ) and using eqns .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) we get the second - order equation for @xmath40 only : @xmath44    the natural boundary condition for this equation is that @xmath40 must vanish at infinity . note that after this equation is solved we have to make sure that the transversality condition @xmath45 is obeyed .    in cartesian",
    "coordinates we get three decoupled scalar equations instead of one vector equation : @xmath46 the green function for the equation @xmath47 with the boundary condition of vanishing at infinity is : @xmath48 therefore , we can write the solutions of the eqns.([a ] ) as @xmath49 and the same for y , z components . thus we can write in the vector form : @xmath50 let us check that this solution is indeed transverse : find @xmath51 .    we have ( here @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 ( note that all differential operations are taken with respect to the vector @xmath54 . )    next , @xmath55    finally we obtain @xmath56    let us now show that it is zero .",
    "note that l.h.s ( and r.h.s ) are _ pseudoscalar _ ( because both @xmath40 and @xmath57 are _ pseudovectors _ ) . to construct this pseudoscalar , we have only two vectors at our disposal : @xmath54 and @xmath58 ( the unit vector along the monopole string ) . from them , we can make only two pseudoscalars : @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ". both of then are zero ( in addition to that , the first combination is ruled out by the condition that it must be linear in @xmath58 , but not quadratic ) .",
    "thus we have shown , that our solution satisfies both the equation @xmath61 and the subsidary condition of transversality , @xmath45 .",
    "let us now find the restrictions on the form of the potential @xmath62 which follow from the general principles ( dimensional analysis , rotational invariance and space reflection ) .",
    "the most general form of @xmath63 , as a _",
    "pseudovector _ depending only on two vectors , @xmath54 and @xmath58 , is :    @xmath64    it is easier to work with dimensionless quantities , so let us write again our initial formula @xmath65 and make a change of variables @xmath66 so that @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 are all dimensionless .",
    "now , @xmath70 so that we get : @xmath71 now , go back to the old variables : @xmath72 now @xmath20 is a dimensionless function of two variables .",
    "let us check if this most general form satisfies the condition of transversality , @xmath45 .",
    "use : @xmath73 but @xmath74 then , @xmath75 therefore @xmath76 denote @xmath77 then , @xmath78 but @xmath79 therefore , @xmath80 hence we see that both terms @xmath81 and @xmath82 give zero when multiplied by the vector product @xmath83 .",
    ": our general form for @xmath40 _ always _ satisfies the transversality condition .",
    "now consider the problem of possible singularities in @xmath63 .    in principle , there are two potential sources of singularities within @xmath63 :    1 .   the @xmath84 behaviour of green s function . 2 .   the singularity of string due to @xmath85 factor .",
    "the worst case is when they occur simultaneously .",
    "let us consider this case .",
    "that is , we consider the case , when the observation point@xmath86 lies on the string , while the integration point @xmath87 approaches it ( i.e. observation point ) .    to see what happens near the observation point ,",
    "let us shift the integration variables : @xmath88 now choose the coordinates : see fig.1 .",
    "put the origin of the spherical system of coordinates at the point m ( i.e. where monopole is ) , z  axis directed opposite the string of monopole . call this system m.    now , introduce a second spherical system with the origin at o. call this system o. obviously , @xmath89 has a simple form in the system o : @xmath90 while the vector potential has a simple form in the system m : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a unit vector in the azimuthal direction .",
    "now , we need to find the relation between the angles @xmath93 and @xmath94 .    for this purpose consider @xmath95 : in it , we know two sides , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and one angle , @xmath98 .",
    "if we find the angle , @xmath99 then @xmath93 will be simply @xmath100 .",
    "we have : @xmath101 since @xmath102 is assumed small , we obtain : @xmath103 but @xmath104onder on .",
    "onder on .",
    "putting all together , we get : @xmath105 from this form , it is clear that @xmath63 does not have any singularity in the case considered .",
    "( note also , that @xmath106 . ) but because we have considered the _",
    "worst _ possible case , we may conclude that _ there are no singularities in @xmath62 at all . _",
    "let us now find the structural form of the magnetic field @xmath107 .    from eqn.([b ] ) which gives us the integral expression for the vector potential @xmath40 , we can obtain the formula for @xmath37 by taking rotor : @xmath108 now , because @xmath109 is a vector ( not a pseudovector ! ) depending on the two vectors only , @xmath58 and @xmath54 , it has the following most general form : @xmath110 a question arises : can @xmath109 be spherically symmetric , that is , can it take the form @xmath111    the answer is no , because in that case we would have @xmath112 everywhere , which is inconsistent with the initial maxwell equations .",
    "having considered the classical theory of massive electrodynamics with magnetic charge , we can now turn to quantum mechanics .",
    "since 1931 , the dirac quantization condition has been derived in many ways differing by their initial assumptions .",
    "obviously those methods using gauge invariance ( such as original dirac derivation or the wu - yang formulation @xcite ) are not applicable in our case .",
    "other methods @xcite depend on rotational invariance and we can try to generalize them to include massive electrodynamics , too . before doing so ,",
    "let us recall very briefly the essence of the standard arguments .",
    "consider an electron placed in the field of a magnetic charge @xmath14 .",
    "the angular momentum operator for the electron is given by @xmath113 despite the stange - looking second term , this operator can be shown to obey all the standard requirements of a _ bona fide _ angular momentum : see commutation relations eqs .",
    "( 2224 ) below .",
    "the angular momentum is the generator of rotations .",
    "the two terms are individually not angular momentum operators , in spite of the appearance of the first term , but the sum is an angular momentum operator ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath114 commute with the hamiltonian @xmath115 next , it was shown in @xcite that the quantity @xmath116 , should be quantized according to @xmath117 which is the dirac quantization condition .",
    "now , we would like to generalize this result to the case of massive electrodynamics .",
    "unfortunately , this turns out to be impossible : we will show that the angular momentum operator can not be defined for the system of charge plus monopole within massive electrodynamics .",
    "more exactly , the following theorem holds .",
    "there are no such operators @xmath114 that the following standard properties are satisfied : @xmath118 = i \\varepsilon_{ijk } l_k\\ ] ] @xmath119 = i \\varepsilon_{ijk } r_k\\ ] ] @xmath120 = i \\varepsilon_{ijk } d_k\\ ] ] where    @xmath121    is the kinetic momentum operator , @xmath122    note that the conditions of this theorem are not too restrictive : for example , we do _ not _ require that the hamiltonian be rotationally invariant ( i.e. , @xmath123=0 $ ] is not required ) .",

    "( [ eq : xiii ] ) and ( [ eq : xiv ] ) .",
    "we notice that :    1 .",
    "terms proportional to @xmath146 in both equations coincide",
    "terms , quadratic in @xmath147 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xiii ] ) must vanish ( because the remaining term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xiv ] ) is linear in @xmath147 and the condition @xmath148 has never been used ) , therefore , we should have @xmath149 3 .   the remaining term ( proportional to @xmath150 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xiii ] ) should be antisymmetric with respect to exchange @xmath151 , in particular , it must vanish for @xmath152 .",

    "thus , we obtain , that the angular momenta with correct commutation relations can exist only if @xmath140 is spherically symmetric : @xmath159 but this is impossible , as we noted above , because it is inconsistent with our initial maxwell equations .    thus our proof is finished .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the introduction of an arbitrary small photon mass makes invalid the existing proofs of the consistency of the dirac monopole theory .",
    "more exactly , the massive electrodynamics does not allow any generalization of the methods in which the dirac monopole was introduced into the massless electrodynamics .",
    "not only the original dirac scheme which arrives at the quantization condition by using the gauge invariance , single - valuedness of the wavefunction and `` the veto '' postulate does not work anymore ; but also the different approach relying on the algebra of angular momentum fails in the case of massive electrodynamics . if the magnetic monopole were ever to be introduced into massive electrodynamics consistently , that would be possible only due to some radically new mechanism compared with the existing ones .",
    "the whole existence of the dirac monopole in the massless electrodynamics rests upon the quantization condition which makes invisible the string attached to the monopole .",
    "the quantization condition can be obtained either with the help of gauge invariance or the angular momentum quantization . in the massive case , both these approaches are not applicable anymore , as we have shown .",
    "that means that there is hardly any way to make the string invisible in the massive electrodynamics.thus , although the system `` string plus monopole '' does exist in massive electrodynamics , it is very difficult , if not impossible , to make a consistent theory of the monopole _ without _ a string .",
    "one may think that our result contradict the principle of continuity which states that any physical consequence of massive electrodynamics should go smoothly into the corresponding result of the standard electrodynamics when the photon mass tends to zero .",
    "indeed , at first sight the appearance of the dirac monopoles at zero photon mass is an obvious discontinuity as compared with their absence at an arbitrary small photon mass .",
    "however , this simple argument is not yet sufficient to claim discontinuity .",
    "an analogy with a similar `` discontinuity '' is instructive here : consider the number of photon degrees of freedom in massive and massless electrodynamics .",
    "the photon with a mass has three polarization states , independent of how small its mass is .",
    "then , as soon as the photon becomes massless , the longitudinal polarization abruptly vanishes and we are left with only two ( transverse ) polarization states .",
    "does this fact create a discontinuity ?",
    "no . to find out if there is a discontinuity or not , we have to study the behavior of a more physical quantity , such as the probabilities to emit or absorb a longitudinal photon , rather than merely counting the number of degrees of freedom",
    "the analysis done by schrdinger shows that if one considers the interaction of longitudinal photons with matter , this interaction vanishes as photon mass tends to zero .",
    "thus the longitudinal photons decouple in the limit @xmath160 so that the continuity is restored .",
    "although we do not intend carrying out this program in the present work , we would like to present here some physical arguments suggesting that the continuity may be indeed preserved .",
    "we have shown that instead of a true dirac monopole , massive electrodynamics contains a more cumbersome object which can be viewed as consisting of three pieces : the monopole , the string and , finally , the additional `` diffuse''magnetic field , eq .",
    "( [ bh ] ) ( or the corresponding vector potential , eq .   ( [ b ] ) ) .",
    "let us call this complex object `` a fake monopole '' . before any discussion of the continuity problem , one has of course make sure that fake monopoles can be described within a logically consistent quantum theory .",
    "this is an open question beyond the present paper , but for the sake of argument let us simply assume that the answer is positive .",
    "then , a natural question arises : how can we physically distinguish between a fake and a true monopoles ?",
    "if the fake monopole has a `` dequantized '' magnetic charge ( i.e. , the charge not obeying the dirac quantization condition , eq .",
    "( [ dirac ] ) ) there does not seem to be any problems .",
    "however , imagine that a fake monopole takes on a magnetic charge which exactly coincides with one of the quantized values .",
    "what happens then ?",
    "let us try and detect the string .",
    "one way to do that is to use the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "but then we run into trouble , because if the magnetic charge has one of the dirac values , _ the strings _ of a fake and true monopoles are _ exactly the same _ .",
    "therefore , _ both of them _ are _ invisible _ in the aharonov - bohm type of experiment .",
    "the way out of this difficulty is to remember about the existence of the feeble `` diffuse '' component of the fake monopole which is of the order of @xmath161 .",
    "generally speaking , this component would give non - zero contribution to the aharonov - bohm effect and thus would , in principle , distinguish between a fake and a true monopoles .",
    "thus , at least in a gedanken experiment we would be able to distinguish between a fake and a true monopoles .",
    "( whether this gedanken experiment can be transformed into a real one , is an open question . )",
    "the observable difference between the fake and true monopoles would vanish _ smoothly _ as the photon mass tends to zero .",
    "so we see that in this particular case there does not arise any problem of discontinuity",
    ". it would be interesting to complement this type of analysis by considering other physical situations , such as cabrera - type of experiment or the scattering of the electron on a monopole .",
    "on the other hand , if the continuity is found to be broken ( which we can not completely rule out at this stage ) , that would constitute a serious argument against the existence of monopoles and thus would provide a possible theoretical reason for the absence of monopoles in nature .",
    "alternatively , the continuous failure to discover the monopoles in the experiment may be considered as an indirect evidence for the finite photon mass ( unfortunately , we can not say anything definite about the value of this mass ) .    in this paper we have considered only fundamental monopoles within massive u(1 )",
    "electrodynamics . a natural question , then ,",
    "is : what about thooft - polyakov monopoles which appear necessarily within gauge theories based on simple groups ( such as su(5 ) ) ?",
    "in such theories , one might give small mass to the photon by spontaneous breaking of the electromagnetic u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "however , there is perhaps less interest in considering such kind of theories because they seem to be ruled out by the experiment .",
    "more specifically , the reason is that after giving photon a mass through spontaneous breaking of u(1 ) symmetry in such theories there arises very light charged particle which is unacceptable experimentally @xcite .",
    "an important feature of such theories is that the electric charge conservation is violated in these theories : to give photon a mass , we need to have a _ charged _ scalar field with _ non - zero _ vacuum expectation ; this necessarily leads to the electric charge non - conservation .",
    "( to make our our discussion of this point more comprehensive , we note that there does exist an acceptable way to spontaneously violate the electric charge conservation and give photon a mass .",
    "but it requires introduction of higgs particles with extremely small electric charge : for details , see @xcite .",
    "however , even this mechanism is extremely difficult or impossible to implement within theories based on semisimple groups ( e.g. su(5 ) ) , see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "thus the present work reveals a new and rather general relation between the two fundamental facts : the masslessness ( massiveness ? ) of the photon and the non - existence ( existence ? ) of the magnetic monopole .",
    "the authors are grateful to m.shaposhnikov , r.volkas and k.wali for stimulating discussions .",
    "we would like to thank h.kleinert for drawing our attention to refs .",
