    "fischer black and myron scholes ( 1973 ) and robert merton ( 1973a ) obtained a fair option price assuming severe and strict theoretical conditions for the market behavior .",
    "the requirements under which these were developed include : ( i ) absence of arbitrage opportunities , _",
    "i.e. _ , identical cashflows have identical values ( sharpe ( 1964 ) ; cox and ross ( 1976 ) ) .",
    "( ii ) efficient market hypothesis , _",
    "i.e. _ , the market incorporates instantaneously any information concerning future market evolution ( fama ( 1965 ) ) .",
    "( iii ) existence of a unique riskless strategy for a portfolio in a complete market ( markowitz ( 1952 ) ) . due to the random character of stock market prices ( cootner ( 1964 ) ) , the implementation of these conditions , especially condition ( ii ) , indicates that speculative prices are driven by white ( _ i.e. _ , delta - correlated ) random processes . at this point , one has to choose between a gaussian white process ( black and scholes ( 1973 ) ; merton ( 1973a ) ) or a white jump process . in this latter case and due to requirement ( iii ) , the jump lengths also have to be known and fixed ( merton ( 1976 ) ) .",
    "there are no other choices for modelling market evolution if the above requirements and ideal conditions are to be obeyed ( cox and ross ( 1976 ) ) .    from these three assumptions ,",
    "condition ( ii ) is perhaps the most restrictive and , in fact , disagrees with empirical evidence since real markets are not efficient , at least at short times ( grossman and stiglitz ( 1980 ) ; fama ( 1991 ) ) . indeed , market efficiency is closely related to the assumption of totally uncorrelated price variations ( white noise ) . but",
    "white noise is only an idealization since , in practice , no actual random process is completely white .",
    "for this reason , white processes are convenient mathematical objects valid only when the observation time is much larger than the autocorrelation time of the process . and , analogously",
    ", the efficient market hypothesis is again a convenient assumption when the observation time is much larger than time spans in which `` inefficiencies '' ( _ i.e. _ , correlations , delays , etc .... ) occur .    alternative models for describing empirical results of the market evolution have been suggested ( mandelbrot ( 1963 ) ; fama ( 1963 ) ) . in each of these , an option price can be obtained only by relaxing some or even all of the initial black - scholes ( b - s ) assumptions ( figlewski ( 1989 ) ; aurell ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is to derive a nontrivial option price by relaxing the efficient market hypothesis and allowing for a finite , non - zero , correlation time of the underlying noise process . as a model for the evolution of the market",
    "we choose the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( o - u ) process ( uhlenbeck and ornstein ( 1930 ) ) for three reasons : ( a ) o - u noise is still a gaussian random process with an arbitrary correlation time @xmath1 and it has the property that when @xmath2 the process becomes gaussian white noise , as in the original black - scholes option case .",
    "( b ) the o - u process is , by virtue of doob s theorem , the only gaussian random process which is simultaneously markovian and stationary ( doob ( 1942 ) ) . in this sense the o - u process is the simplest generalization of gaussian white - noise .",
    "( c ) as we will see later on , the variance of random processes driven by o - u noise seems to agree with the evolution of market variance , at least in some particular but relevant cases .",
    "the ornstein - uhlenbeck process is not a newcomer in mathematical finance .",
    "for instance , it has already been proposed as a model for stochastic volatility ( sv ) .",
    "our case here is rather different since , contrary to sv models , we only have one source of noise .",
    "we therefore suggest the o - u process as the driving noise for the underlying price dynamics when the volatility is still a deterministic quantity ( dumas ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "the autocorrelation in the underlying driving noise is closely related to the predictability of asset returns , of which there seems to be ample evidence ( breen and jagannathan ( 1989 ) ; campbell and hamao ( 1992 ) ) .",
    "indeed , if for some particular stock the price variations are correlated during some time @xmath3 , then the price at time @xmath4 will be related to the price at a previous time @xmath5 as long as the time span @xmath6 is not too long compared to the correlation time @xmath3 .",
    "hence correlation implies partial predictability .",
    "other approaches to option pricing with predictable asset returns are based under the assumption the market is still driven by white noise and predictability is induced by the drift ( lo and wang ( 1995 ) ) . since the b - s formula is independent of the drift , these approaches apply b - s theory with a conveniently modified volatility .",
    "our approach here is rather different because we assume the asset price variations driven by correlated noise which implies some degree of predictability .    summarizing , our purpose is to study option pricing and hedging in a more realistic framework that of white noise process presented by black and scholes .",
    "our model includes colored noise and the dependence of the volatility on time . both",
    "are empirically observed in real markets ( bouchaud and potters ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "empirical characteristic time scales are at least of the order of minutes and can affect option prices particularly when the exercising date is near and speculative fluctuations are more important . presumably , this effect is negligible when correlation times are shorter ( much shorter than time to expiration ) . in any case , it is interesting to know how , and by how much , the option price and its properties are modified when correlations in the underlying noise are significant .",
    "the shortest way of getting the call price , and hence quantifying the effect of correlations on prices is by martingale methods .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure does not guarantee that we obtain the fairest price since arbitrage and hedging are not included in this approach .",
    "it is therefore our main objective to generalize b - s theory not only to get a new call price but , more importantly , to obtain a hedging strategy that avoids risk and arbitrage opportunities .    from a technical point of view",
    ", we apply the b - s option pricing method after projecting the two - dimensional o - u process onto a one - dimensional diffusion process with time varying volatility .",
    "as we will show , this projection allows us to maintain the conditions of a perfect hedging and the absence of arbitrage .",
    "moreover , the price obtained using this way completely agrees with the price obtained using two alternative and different methods .",
    "one of them is based on martingale theory , and the other one develops a new option pricing with a modified portfolio containing secondary options instead of the underlying stock .",
    "the paper is divided into eight sections . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we present our two - dimensional stochastic model for the underlying asset . in section  [ sec : projected ] we find the o - u projection onto the stock price correlated process . section  [ sec : bs ] concentrates on the b - s option price derivation with the projected process , and sections  [ sec : alt ] and  [ sec : martingale ] show the consistency of this derivation by using two alternative methods for obtaining the option price .",
    "the greeks and the new hedging are presented in section  [ sec : hedging ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conc ] and technical details are left to the appendices .",
    "the standard assumption in option pricing theory is to assume that the underlying price @xmath7 can be modelled as a one - dimensional diffusion process : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wiener process . in the original b - s theory both drift @xmath10 and volatility @xmath11",
    "are constants .",
    "other models take @xmath12 and @xmath13 as functions of time and underlying price ( cox and ross ( 1976 ) ; bergman ( 1987 ) ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is assumed to be a random quantity in the sv models .",
    "notice that if the time evolution of the underlying price is governed by eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) then @xmath7 is an uncorrelated random process in the sense that its zero - mean return rate defined by @xmath14 is driven by white noise , _",

    "hence , the asset model immediately incorporates price return effects and meets the efficient market hypothesis .",
    "as a first step , we assume that the underlying price is not driven by the wiener process @xmath9 but by o - u noise @xmath20 . in other words , we say that @xmath7 obeys a singular two - dimensional diffusion @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath0 is the correlation time .",
    "more precisely , @xmath20 is o - u noise in the stationary regime , which is a gaussian colored noise with zero mean and correlation function : @xmath23=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\tau}e^{-|t_1-t_2|/\\tau}.   \\label{correlv}\\ ] ]    we call the process defined by eqs .",
    "( [ 2a])-([3a ] ) singular diffusion because , contrary to sv models , the wiener driving noise @xmath9 only appears in one of the equations , and this results in a singular diffusion matrix ( gardiner ( 1985 ) ) .",
    "observe that we now deal with autocorrelated stock prices since the zero - mean return rate @xmath24 is colored noise , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath15=(\\sigma^2/2\\tau ) \\exp[-|t_1-t_2|/\\tau]$ ] .",
    "note that when @xmath2 this correlation goes to @xmath25 and we thus recover the one - dimensional diffusion discussed above .",
    "therefore the case of positive @xmath3 is a measure of the inefficiencies of the market .",
    "there is an alternative , and sometimes more convenient , way of writing the above equations using the asset return @xmath26 defined by @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the time at which we start observing the process  ( [ 2a])-([3a ] ) . without loss of generality this time",

    "( [ 2a])-([3a ] ) , we may have @xmath30 @xmath31 , \\label{4b}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is gaussian white noise defined as the derivative of the wiener process .",
    "this process exists in the sense of generalized random functions ( lighthill ( 1958 ) ; stratonovich ( 1963 ) ) . the combination of relations in eqs .",
    "( [ 4a ] ) and  ( [ 4b ] ) leads to a second - order stochastic differential equation for @xmath26 @xmath33 from this equation , we clearly see that when @xmath2 we recover the one - dimensional diffusion case  ( [ 1a ] ) , eq .  ( [ 3a ] ) shows that @xmath34 .",
    "thus @xmath20 is a constant , which we may equal to zero , and from eq .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) we have @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the underlying price evolves as a riskless security . later on we will recover this deterministic case ( see , for instance , eq .",
    "( [ deterministic ] ) ) . ] .",
    "we also observe that the o - u process @xmath20 is the random part of the return velocity , @xmath36 , and we will often refer to @xmath20 as the `` velocity '' of the return process @xmath26 .    in appendix",
    "a , we give explicit expressions for @xmath20 and for the return @xmath26 .",
    "we prove there that @xmath26 is a non - stationary process with the conditional mean value @xmath37=\\mu t+\\tau\\left(1-e^{-t/\\tau}\\right)v_0 , \\label{mr}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the initial velocity .",

    "( [ k ] ) ) @xmath52 . \\label{varr}\\ ] ]    a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ varr ] ) is that , when @xmath53 , the variance behaves as @xmath54 equation  ( [ varr ] ) also shows a crossover to ordinary diffusion ( b - s case ) when @xmath55 : @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot @xmath57 along with the empirical variance from data of the s&p 500 cash index during the period january 1988-december 1996 .",
    "the dashed line represents results obtained by assuming normal - diffusion @xmath58 .",
    "observe that the empirical variance is very well fitted by our theoretical variance @xmath59 for a correlation time @xmath60 minutes .",
    "furthermore , the result of this correlation affects the empirical volatility for around @xmath61 minutes .",
    "these times are probably too small to affect call price to any quantifiable extent . however , the s&p 500 is one of the most liquid , and therefore most efficient , markets .",
    "consequently , the effect of correlations in any other less efficient market might significantly influence option prices and hedging strategies , and this is the main motivation for this work .",
    "one may argue that the o - u process  ( [ 2a])-([3a ] ) is an inadequate asset model since the share price @xmath7 given by eq .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) is a continuous random process with bounded variations . as harrison ( 1984 ) showed ,",
    "continuous processes with bounded variations allow arbitrage opportunities and this is an undesirable feature for obtaining a fair price .",
    "thus , for instance , arbitrage would be possible within a portfolio containing bonds and stock whose strategy at time @xmath62 is buying ( or selling ) stock shares when @xmath63 is greater ( or lower ) than the risk - free bond rate ( harrison ( 1984 ) ) .    in our case",
    ", however , the problem is that in the practice _ the return velocity @xmath20 is nontradable and its evolution is ignored_. in other words , in real markets the observed asset dynamics does not show any trace of the velocity variable would imply knowing the value of the return @xmath26 at two different times , since @xmath64 obviously , this operation is not performed by traders who only manage portfolios at time @xmath62 based on prices at @xmath62 and not at any earlier time . ] .",
    "this feature allows us to perform a projection of the two - dimensional diffusion process @xmath65 $ ] onto a one - dimensional equivalent process @xmath66 independent of the velocity @xmath67 .",
    "we will show in this section that the projected process @xmath66 , which is equal to the actual price @xmath7 in mean square sense , obeys the following one - dimensional sde @xmath68 dt +   \\sqrt{\\dot{\\kappa}(t - t ) } dw(t ) , \\label{sde}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is given by eq .",
    "( [ varr ] ) , and the dot denotes time derivative .",
    "therefore , the price given by eq .",
    "( [ sde ] ) is driven by a noise of unbounded variation , the wiener process , and the harrison ( 1984 ) results do not apply . in consequence ,",
    "the o - u projected process is still a suitable starting point for option pricing since it does not permit arbitrage .",
    "note that the dynamics of the return @xmath69 $ ] is given by the second - order sde  ( [ 6 ] ) which includes the stochastic evolution of the velocity @xmath20 .",

    "the assumption of uncorrelated assets overprices the european call .",
    "this agrees with the fact that correlation , which can be regarded as a form of predictability , implies less risk and therefore a lower price for the option .",
    "we have quantified this overprice and showed that b - s formula notably overprices options and , more strikingly , that the overprice persists for a long time regardless of the strength of correlations .",
    "we have also analyzed the sensitivity of the o - u price to several conditions .",

    "the option price and the hedging strategy have been obtained using two different approaches .",
    "the most straightforward way of getting the call price is by means of a projection onto a one - dimensional process with a time - varying volatility .",
    "a second way of obtaining the option price starts with the complete two - dimensional o - u process  ( [ 2a])-([3a ] ) .",
    "this is a longer procedure but opens the door to a new hedging strategy : the psi hedging .",
    "we have therefore two ways of acheiving the perfect hedging : the usual one consisting in holding underlying assets ( delta hedging ) , and the second one which uses secondary calls instead of assets ( psi hedging ) .",
    "we have shown that this last strategy can be considerable less expensive than the delta hedging and can avoid a possible lack of liquidity of underlying shares . finally , the proportion of secondary calls to be held , _",
    "i.e. _ , the psi hedging , converges towards o - u delta hedging when the exercising price of the secondary call tends to zero .    in practice our method of valuation requires the estimate of one more parameter , the correlation time , than in the b - s wiener case . assuming that the underlying asset is driven by o - u noise one can find an estimate for the correlation time @xmath3 by evaluating the variance @xmath59 of the asset return . once one has an estimate of this variance the correlation time is given in eq .",

    "we finally mention that one interesting extension of the valuation method presented is to the american option .",
    "although this case is more involved , one is probably able to obtain , at least an approximate or a numerical result using a combination of first passage times and martingale methods , as recently presented by bunch and johnson ( 2000 ) . in any case",
