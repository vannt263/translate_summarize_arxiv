    "the theoretical physics community has recently exhibited increasing interest in the possibility of ultra - high - energy violations of lorentz invariance,@xcite@xcite and in the possibility of quantum - gravity - induced spacetime anisotropies and multi - refringence . specifically  recent speculations regarding lorentz symmetry breaking and/or fundamental anisotropies and/or multi - refringence arise separately in the many and various approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "such phenomena arise in loop quantum gravity,@xcite string models,@xcite and causal dynamical triangulations,@xcite and are also part and parcel of the `` analogue spacetime '' programme,@xcite and of many attempts at developing `` emergent gravity''.@xcite@xcite recently , the ultra - high energy breaking of lorentz invariance has been central to the horava ",
    "lifshitz models.@xcite@xcite of course not all models of quantum gravity lead to high - energy lorentz symmetry breaking , and the comments below should be viewed as exploring one particular class of interesting models .",
    "if we wish to develop a geometric spacetime framework for representing lorentz symmetry breaking , either due to spacetime anisotropies or multi - refringence , then it certainly can not be standard pseudo  riemannian geometry .",
    "this strongly suggests that carefully thought out extensions and modifications of pseudo  riemannian geometry might be of real interest to both the general relativity and high - energy communities . in particular , when attempting to generalize pseudo - riemannian geometry the interplay between the `` signal cones '' of a multi - refringent theory and the generalized spacetime geometry is an issue of considerable interest :    * in standard general relativity the ( single , unique ) signal cone almost completely specifies the spacetime geometry  one need only supplement the signal cone structure with one extra degree of freedom at each point in spacetime , an overall conformal factor , in order to completely specify the spacetime metric , and thereby completely specify the geometry .",
    "( this is ultimately due to the fact that in standard pseudo - riemannian geometry the scalar product is a simple bilinear operation . ) * in multi - refringent situations it is quite easy to unify all the signal cones in one single fresnel equation that simultaneously describes all polarization modes on an equal footing . * in a standard manifold setting , where we retain the usual commutative coordinates , we shall see that it is natural to demand that each polarization mode can be assigned an independent pseudo - finsler metric .",
    "earlier work on finsler - like applications to physics includes that of takano@xcite , asanov@xcite , vacaru@xcite@xcite , and others.@xcite@xcite more recent work has appeared in references   , and other articles cited below .",
    "* what is exceedingly difficult , and we shall argue is in fact outright impossible within this framework , is to construct a _ unified _ formalism that moves `` off - shell '' ( off the signal cones ) .",
    "* this is a _ negative _ result , a `` no - go theorem '' , which we hope will focus attention on what can and can not be accomplished in any natural way when dealing with multi - refringent anisotropic finsler - like extensions to general relativistic spacetime . *",
    "if one steps outside of the usual manifold picture , either by adopting non - commutative coordinates , or even more abstract choices such as spin foams , causal dynamical triangulations , or string - inspired models , then the issues addressed in this article are moot  our considerations are relevant only insofar as one is interested in the first nontrivial deviations from exact low - energy lorentz invariance , and only relevant insofar as these first nontrivial effects can be placed in a finsler - like setting .",
    "considerable insight into such finsler - like models can be provided by considering the `` analogue spacetime '' programme , where analogue models of curved spacetime emerge at some level from well understood physical systems.@xcite in particular , the physics of _ _ bi - axial bi - refringent crystals__@xcite provides a particularly simple physical analogue model for the mathematical object introduced some 155 years ago by bernhard riemann,@xcite and now known as a finsler distance .",
    "( see [ a : riemann ] for some general mathematical background regarding finsler spaces . )",
    "we shall soon see that this mathematical object can reasonably easily be extended to a lorentzian - signature pseudo - finsler space - time , with an appropriate pseudo - finsler norm , though defining a pseudo - finsler metric is more subtle and fraught with technical problems .",
    "( it must be emphasized that , despite many misapprehensions to the contrary , _ uni - axial _ birefringent crystals are relatively uninteresting in this regard ; they do not lead to finsler 3-spaces , but `` merely '' yield bi - metric riemannian 3-geometries . )",
    "while the use of finsler 3-spaces to describe crystal optics is reasonably common knowledge within the community of mathematicians and physicists studying finsler spaces , it is very difficult to get a clear and concise explanation of exactly what is going on when one generalizes to lorentzian signature space - time .",
    "in particular the fact that any relativistic formulation of finsler space needs to work in lorentzian signature @xmath0 , instead of the euclidean signature @xmath1 more typically used by the mathematical community , leads to many technical subtleties ( and can sometimes completely invalidate naive conclusions ) .",
    "note that for the purposes of the current article we are not particularly interested in the properties of birefringent crystals _",
    "per se _ , we are really only interested in them as an _ exemplar _ of finsler 3-space and finsler space - time , as a guidepost to more complicated things that may happen in finslerian extensions to general relativity .",
    "we shall already see a number of interesting pitfalls arising at this ( in principle ) quite elementary level .",
    "our ultimate goal is to be able to say something about the ( presumed ) low - energy manifold - like limit of whatever quantum theory , or class of quantum theories , approximately reproduces einstein gravity . to this end",
    ", our `` no - go '' result indicates that the popular assumption that anisotropies and multi - refingence are likely to occur in `` quantum gravity '' leads to significant difficulties for the einstein equivalence principle  since even the loosest interpretation of the einstein equivalence principle would imply the necessity of a coherent formalism for dealing with all signal comes , and the spacetime geometry , in some unified manner .",
    "we conclude that , despite the fact that spacetime anisotropies and multi - refringence are very popularly assumed to be natural features of `` quantum gravity '' , and while these features have a straightforward `` on - shell '' implementation in terms of a suitably defined fresnel equation , there is no natural way of extending them `` off - shell '' and embedding them into a single over - arching spacetime geometry .",
    "purely for the purposes of developing a useful analogy , which we shall use as a guide to the mathematics we wish to develop , we will focus on the optical physics of _ bi - axial bi - refringent crystals_.@xcite after very briefly presenting the basic definitions , we show how various purely spatial _ 3-space _",
    "finsler structures arise .",
    "( many purely technical details , when not directly involved in the logic flow , will be relegated to the appendices . )",
    "we again emphasize that _ uni - axial _ bi - refringent crystals , which are what much of the technical literature and textbook presentations typically focus on , are for our purposes rather uninteresting  uni - axial bi - refringent crystals `` merely '' lead to bi - metric riemannian space - times and are from a finslerian perspective `` trivial '' .",
    "we shall soon see that even in three - dimensional _ space _ there are _ at least four _ logically distinct finsler structures of interest : on the tangent space each of the two photon polarizations leads , via study of the _ group velocity _ , to two quite distinct finsler spacetimes . on the co - tangent space",
    "each of the two photon polarizations leads , via study of the _ phase velocity _ , to two quite distinct co - finsler spacetimes .",
    "the inter - relations between these four structures is considerably more subtle than one might naively expect .",
    "additionally , ( apart from some purely technical difficulties along the optical axes in bi - axial crystals ) , each of these four 3-dimensional spatial finsler structures has a natural 4-dimensional extension to a _ spacetime _ pseudo - finsler structure . beyond that , there are reasonably natural ways of merging the two photon polarizations into `` unified '' finsler and co - finsler _ norms _ , closely related to the appropriate fresnel equation , though the associated finsler _ metrics _ are considerably more problematic  all these mathematical constructions do come with a price",
    " and we shall be careful to point out exactly where the the technical difficulties lie .",
    "finally , using this well - understood physical system as a template , we shall ( in the spirit of analogue spacetime programme@xcite ) then ask what this might tell us about possible finslerian extensions to general relativity , and in particular to the subtle relationship between bi - refringence and bi - metricity,@xcite@xmath2@xcite ( or more generally , multi - refringence and multi - metricity ) .",
    "specifically , we have investigated the possibility of whether it is possible to usefully and cleanly deal with both finsler structure ( anisotropy ) and multi - refringence _",
    "simultaneously_. that is , given two ( or more ) `` signal cones '' : is it possible to naturally and intuitively construct a `` unified '' pseudo - finsler spacetime such that the pseudo - finsler _ metric _ specifies null vectors on these `` signal cones '' , _ but has no other zeros or singularities _ ?",
    "our results are much less encouraging than we had originally hoped , for and lead to a `` no - go '' result .",
    "our analysis suggests suggest that while pseudo - finsler spacetimes are certainly useful constructs , they do not appear suitable for dealing with multi - refringence  when trying to analyze the full spacetime geometry ( instead of merely restricting attention to the signal cones ) it seems physically more appropriate to think of physics as taking place in a single topological manifold that carries several distinct pseudo - finsler metrics , one for each polarization mode .",
    "mathematically , a finsler function ( finsler norm , finsler distance function ) is defined as a function @xmath3 on the tangent bundle to a manifold such that,@xcite@xcite @xmath4 this then allows one to define a notion of distance on the manifold , in the sense that @xmath5 is now guaranteed to be independent of the specific parameterization @xmath6 . in the case of a ( pseudo)riemannian manifold with metric @xmath7 one would take @xmath8 but a general ( pseudo)finslerian manifold the function @xmath9 is arbitrary except for the linearity constraint in @xmath10 . note that in euclidean signature , the general finsler function @xmath3 is typically smooth except at @xmath11 . in",
    "lorentzian signature however , @xmath3 is typically non - smooth for all null vectors  so that non - smoothness issues have grown to affect ( and infect ) the entire null cone ( signal cone ) . as we shall subsequently see below , sometimes a suitable higher algebraic _ power _",
    ", @xmath12 , of the pseudo - finsler norm is smooth .    in significant contrast to the above , to ensure smoothness of the finsler _ metric _ , defined below , it is advisable ( even in the euclidean - signature case , let alone in lorentzian signature ) to go beyond the smoothness of @xmath3 and to demand the considerably stronger condition that the square @xmath13 be smooth , except possibly at @xmath11 .",
    "it is standard to define the ( pseudo)finsler _ metric _ as @xmath14 \\over \\partial v^a \\ ; \\partial v^b}\\ ] ] which then satisfies the constraint @xmath15 this can be viewed as a `` direction - dependent metric '' , and is clearly a significant generalization of the usual ( pseudo)riemannian case .",
    "almost all of the relevant mathematical literature has been developed for the euclidean signature case ( where @xmath16 is taken to be a positive definite matrix ) .",
    "because of this assumption , any mathematical result that depends critically on the assumed positive definite nature of the matrix of metric coefficients _ can not _ be carried over into the physically interesting pseudo - finsler regime , at least not without an independent proof that avoids the positive definite assumption .",
    "( unfortunately it is not uncommon to find significant mathematical errors in the pseudo - finsler physics literature due to neglect of this elementary point . )",
    "basic references within the mathematical literature include .",
    "there have been several recent attempts at using finsler geometry in various aspects of current physics research .",
    "for example , one use is related to anisotropic geometries,@xcite another is related to modifications of general relativity and cosmology.@xcite in more fundamental work , finsler geometries have been directly related to lorentz symmetry breaking in so - called `` very special relativity''.@xcite more recently , it has been noted that the geometry of the spatial slices of arbitrary stationary space - times can cleanly be interpreted in terms of the particular class of finsler geometries known as randers spaces.@xcite ( one might also try to generalize the spacetime in a slightly different direction by adopting the notion of an `` area metric'',@xcite but we shall not take that particular route for now . )    an application more directly related to our specific topic of interest was made by duval,@xcite where he uses 3-dimensional purely _ spatial _ finsler geometries ( effectively choosing a preferred inertial frame ) .",
    "the use of finsler geometry for birefringent crystal optics was also analysed from a more mathematical point of view in reference , but this is again restricted to 3-dimensional , preferred - frame , purely _ spatial _ finsler geometry .",
    "in contrast , we are for current purposes interested in building up a full _ ( 3 + 1)-dimensional pseudo - finsler space - time geometry _ based on birefringent crystals , as at a minimum such a space - time formulation will certainly be necessary for developing the possible extensions of general relativity we are interested in .",
    "the key physics point in bi - axial bi - refringent crystal optics is that the group velocities , and the phase velocities , are both anisotropic , and depend on direction in a rather complicated way .",
    "technical details that would detract from the flow of the article are relegated to [ a : bw ] .",
    "we can summarize the situation by pointing out that the group velocity is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are known quadratic functions of the direction @xmath20 .",
    "the coefficients in these quadratic forms are explicit functions of the components of the @xmath21 permittivity tensor .",
    "see equations  ( [ e : bar - q0 ] ) and ( [ e : bar - q2 ] ) . the function @xmath22 so defined is homogeneous of degree zero in the components of @xmath20 : @xmath23 the homogeneous degree zero property should remind one of the relevant feature exhibited by the finsler metric .",
    "it is also useful to calculate the so - called `` group slowness '' : @xmath24 let us now first define the quantities @xmath25 or adopt the perhaps more transparent notation @xmath26 this is by inspection a 3-dimensional ( riemannian ) finsler distance defined on _ space _ , having all the correct homogeneity properties , @xmath27 .",
    "physically , the finsler distance is in this situation the time taken for the wavepacket to travel a distance @xmath28 .",
    "one sometimes encounters comments in the literature to the effect that this specific finsler distance is an example of a kropina metric .",
    "such comments are unfortunately _",
    "false_. if we define @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , then kropina metrics are of the form @xmath31 , and the more general class of so - called @xmath32 metrics is of the form @xmath33 . by inspection , the finsler geometry arising in bi - axial optics",
    "is neither a kropina metric nor even an @xmath32 metric .",
    "in contrast , the finsler 3-norm @xmath34 defined above is certainly compatible with equation  ( 3.14 ) of reference . to see this , it is a brief calculation to verify that @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the ray optical axes as defined in [ a : axes ] .",
    "see also equation  ( [ e : discriminant ] ) below .",
    "unfortunately in the bi - axial case equation  ( 3.13 ) of reference   is not correct , unless you reinterpret the denominator in that equation not ( as claimed ) as a riemannian metric , but instead as a finsler metric in its own right . nor in the uni - axial case is equation  ( 3.13 ) of reference   correct ; the correct statement is that in the uni - axial case both ordinary and extraordinary rays are governed by ( distinct ) but quite ordinary riemannian geometries .",
    "to now extend the construction given above to full ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional _ spacetime _ , we first define a generic 4-vector @xmath37 and then formally construct @xmath38 that is @xmath39 even more explicitly , one may write @xmath40^{1/2}. \\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the null cones ( signal cones ) of @xmath41 are defined by @xmath42 so far this has given us a very natural _ pair _ of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional pseudo  finsler structures in terms of the ray velocities corresponding to the two photon polarizations .    for future use , let us now formally define the quantity @xmath43 this is tantalizingly close to the quartic extension of the notion of distance that bernhard riemann speculated about in his inaugural lecture.@xcite see [ a : riemann ] , and especially equation  ( [ e : riemann4 ] ) .",
    "this is certainly an example of a specific and simple @xmath44-root pseudo - finsler norm that can naturally and symmetrically be constructed from the two polarization modes , and its properties ( and defects ) are certainly worth investigationg .",
    "physically the condition @xmath45 defines a double - sheeted conoid ( a double - sheeted topological cone ) that is the union of the propagation cone of the individual photon polarizations .",
    "however we shall soon see that even though this construction is formally very close to riemann s original suggestion , when it comes to defining a finsler spacetime _",
    "metric _ this construction nevertheless leads to a number of severe technical difficulties ; difficulties that can be tracked back to the fact that we are working in lorentzian signature .      in counterpoint , as a function of wave - vector the phase velocity is @xmath46 where the quadratics @xmath47 and @xmath48 are now given by equations  ( [ e : q2 ] ) and ( [ e : q0 ] ) .",
    "this expression is homogeneous of order zero in @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 again , we begin to see a hint of finsler structure emerging . because @xmath49 is a wave - vector it transforms in the same way as the gradient of the phase ; thus @xmath49 is most naturally thought of as living in the 3-dimensional space of co - tangents to physical 3-space .",
    "let us now define a _ co - finsler _ structure on that co - tangent space by @xmath51 we use the symbol @xmath52 rather than @xmath53 to emphasize that this is a co - finsler structure , and note that this object satisfies the required homogeneity property @xmath54 now let us go for a ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional spacetime interpretation : consider the 4-co - vector @xmath55 and define @xmath56 that is @xmath57 more explicitly @xmath58^{1/2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we again see that this object satisfies the required homogeneity property @xmath59 so that this object is indeed suitable for interpretation as a co - finsler structure .",
    "furthermore the _ null co - vectors _ of @xmath60 are defined by @xmath61 which is exactly the notion of _ dispersion relation _ for allowed `` on mass shell '' wave-4-vectors that we are trying to capture .",
    "thus @xmath62 lives naturally on the co - tangent space to physical spacetime , and we can interpret it as a pseudo - co - finsler structure .    we can again define a `` unified '' quantity @xmath63 physically , the condition @xmath64 simultaneously encodes both dispersion relations for the two photon polarizations .",
    "furthermore , we see that @xmath65 is tantalizingly close to a co - tangent space version of the quartic expression considered by bernhard riemann.@xcite again , see [ a : riemann ] , and especially equation  ( [ e : riemann4 ] ) . physically the condition @xmath66 defines a double - sheeted conoid ( a double - sheeted topological cone ) that is the union of the dispersion relations of the individual photon polarizations .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath67 can be viewed as a fresnel equation , and can indeed be directly related to fresnel s condition for the propagation of a mode of 4-wavenumber @xmath68 . as is the case for @xmath69 , we shall soon see that even though this construction for @xmath67 is formally very close to riemann s original suggestion , this construction ( once one tries to extract a spacetime co - finsler _ metric _ ) nevertheless leads to a number of severe technical difficulties ; difficulties that can again be tracked back to the fact that we are now working in lorentzian signature .",
    "the situation as presented so far looks very pleasant and completely under control  and if what we had seen so far were all there was to the matter , then the study of pseudo - finsler space - times would be very straightforward indeed  but now let us indicate where potential problems are hiding .    *",
    "note that up to this stage we have not established any direct connection between the finsler functions @xmath70 and the co - finsler functions @xmath71 .",
    "physically it is clear that they must be very closely related , but ( as we shall soon see ) establishing the precise connection is tricky . * furthermore , the transition from finsler _ distance _ to finsler _ metric _ requires at least two derivatives . even in riemannian signature",
    "this places some smoothness constraints on the finsler distance , smoothness constraints that are nontrivial and not always satisfied .",
    "( in riemannian signature potential problems are confined to the immediate vicinity of the zero vector . )",
    "* there are also additional problematic technical issues involving the 4-dimensional _ spacetime _ pseudo - finsler and pseudo - co - finsler metrics  again certain components of the metric are infinite , but this time the potential pathology is more widespread .",
    "( in lorentzian signature potential problems tend to infect the entire null cone . )",
    "the standard definition used to generate a finsler _ metric _ from a finsler _ distance _ is to set : @xmath72\\over \\partial n^i \\ , \\partial n^j},\\ ] ] which in this particular case implies @xmath73\\over \\partial n^i \\ , \\partial n^j}.\\ ] ]",

    "this is obvious from the fact that squares of both finsler functions are not even everywhere differentiable .",

    "consider the ( ray ) discriminant @xmath82 there are three cases of immediate ( mathematical ) interest :    * isotropic : * if @xmath83 then @xmath84 ; in this case the two finsler functions @xmath85 are equal to ech other .",
    "@xmath86 then describes an ordinary riemannian geometry , and @xmath69 an ordinary pseudo  riemannian geometry .",
    "this is the standard situation , and is for our current purposes physically uninteresting .",
    "* uni - axial : * if one of the principal velocities is distinct from the other two , then we can without loss of generality set @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the discriminant then factorizes into a perfect square @xmath89 in this case it is immediately clear that both @xmath90 reduce to simple quadratics , and so describe two ordinary riemannian geometries .",
    "indeed @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the language of crystal optics @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the `` ordinary '' and `` extraordinary '' ray velocities of a uni - axial birefringent crystal . in geometrical language the two photon polarizations `` see '' distinct riemannian 3-geometries @xmath90 and distinct pseudo - riemannian 4-geometries @xmath41  this situation is referred to as `` bi - metric '' .",
    "this situation is for our current purposes physically uninteresting .    * bi - axial : * the full power of the finsler approach is _ only _ needed for the bi - axial situation where the three principal velocities are distinct",
    "this is the _ only _ situation of real physical interest for us , as it is the only situation that leads to a non - trivial finsler metric . in this case",
    "we can without loss of generality orient the axes so that @xmath95 .",

    "if we give up the condition of `` intuitiveness '' , so that we abandon riemann s @xmath44-root proposal , then @xmath171 and @xmath60 do not just factorize into a product of powers of the finsler functions for individual polarizations .",
    "we could then look for more complicated ways of building `` unified '' finsler and co - finsler structures ( constrained mainly by giving the correct light propagation cones in the birefringent crystal ) , and we might be able to find an appropriate finsler geometry ( which might also fulfill some additional reasonable physical conditions ) .",
    "the necessary conditions for such a geometry are relatively easy to formulate , but because of lack of intuitiveness , and corresponding lack of direct physical motivation , the physical meaning of such an approach is highly doubtful.@xcite    in short , our `` no go '' result is this : there is no natural and compelling way of assembling the individual finsler metrics into a `` unified '' whole  this despite the fact that it _ is _ possible to assemble the individual finsler norms into a `` unified '' whole that accurately reflects the behaviour expected from looking at the fresnel equation or the on - shell dispersion relations .",
    "the results of this investigation have been rather mixed . on the one hand",
    "we have seen how birefringent crystal optics is a good exemplar for providing a clean physical implementation of the mathematical notion of a finsler norm and finsler metric . on the other hand",
    "we have also seen how even this rather straightforward physical model , with its very clear and direct physical interpretation , nevertheless leads to a number of technical mathematical difficulties that are of physical importance .    *",
    "while the 3-space finsler and co - finsler _ norms _ corresponding to the two photon polarizations are always well - defined , the 3-space finsler and co - finsler _ metrics _ have undesirable properties on the optical axes  ultimately this is due to the fact that the two photon polarizations have the same group velocity ( and same phase velocity ) only on the optical axes  so that the structure of the indicatrix ( the surface describing speed as a function of direction ) is complicated ( continuous but not differentiable ) on the optical axes .",
    "this feature then also afflicts the 4-space pseudo - finsler and pseudo - co - finsler metrics that cam be constructed for each individual photon polarization .",
    "while annoying , this problematic feature in 3-space is at least physically isolated to the optical axes . *",
    "it is when one tries to `` unify '' the two polarization modes into a single structure that deeper problems arise  again the 4-space pseudo - finsler and pseudo - co - finsler _ norms _ are certainly well defined ( and are extremely close to riemann s original conception of what a @xmath44-order geometry should look like ) , but now the 4-space pseudo - finsler and pseudo - co - finsler _ metrics _ are singular on the entire signal cone and mass shell respectively .",
    "this problematic feature is intimately related to the fact that we are dealing with _ pseudo_-finsler and _ pseudo_-co - finsler geometries  it is a `` divide by zero '' problem , associated with non - zero null vectors on the signal cone ( and mass shell ) , that leads to singular values for metric components . the feature seems to us to be quite comprehensive and to be generic to any attempt at merging pseudo - finsler metrics with multi - refringence .",
    "we have worked through the mathematical aspects of the finsler space interpretation of birefringent optics in some detail because this is a situation in which we _ know _ and _ understand _ the basic physics in considerable detail . because of this , any problematic mathematical details or physics oddities we run across can not be ascribed to unknown details of the physics  any unusual features we encounter must be ascribed to our choice of mathematical formalism , and if they already arise in this very simple physical system , then any such unusual features are likely to be inherited by more complicated physical situations .",
    "( in particular , since our long range goal is to develop insight into `` quantum gravity phenomenology '' , issues we encounter here are likely to re - occur there , possibly with even more virulence . )",
    "overall , the lessons learned form this particular model have led us to re - evaluate and re - assess the notion of what it means to have a lorentzian - signature finsler geometry , and in particular what it means to have a lorentzian - signature finsler _ metric _  and to re - assess the precise nature of the relationship between birefringence and bimetricity ( or more generally multi - refringence and multi - metricity ) . while pseudo - finsler spacetimes are certainly useful constructs , in birefringent situations it does not appear possible to naturally and intuitively construct a `` unified '' pseudo - finsler spacetime such that the pseudo - finsler metric is null on both `` signal cones '' , but has no other zeros or singularities  it seems physically more appropriate to think of physics as taking place in a single topological manifold that carries a number of distinct pseudo - finsler metrics , one for each polarization mode .",
    "that is , the objects @xmath41 individually define perfectly good pseudo - finsler _ norms _ and _ metrics _ , but the natural `` unified '' quantity @xmath69 , while it defines a perfectly good pseudo - finsler _ norm _ , leads to a seriously diseased pseudo - finsler _",
    "metric_. this is an important point , and we are still actively developing our ideas on this matter .",
