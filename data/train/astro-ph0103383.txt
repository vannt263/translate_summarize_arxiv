    "the term `` brown dwarf '' was coined in 1975 by jill tarter ( 1975 ) to describe substellar - mass objects ( smos ) , but astronomers had to wait 20 years before the announcement of the discovery of the first unimpeachable example , gliese 229b ( oppenheimer 1995 ) .",
    "that same _ day _ , the first extrasolar giant planet ( egp ) was announced ( mayor and queloz 1995 ) and it startled the world by being _ 100 _ times closer to its primary than jupiter is to the sun .",
    "to date , more than 50 egps have been discovered by radial - velocity techniques around stars with spectral types from m4 to f7 ( see table [ beast ] ) .",
    "the `` planets '' themselves have minimum masses ( @xmath1 ) between @xmath20.25 and @xmath210 ( @xmath3 one jupiter mass ) , orbital semi - major axes ( @xmath4 ) from @xmath20.04 a.u .",
    "to @xmath23.8 a.u . , and eccentricities as high as @xmath20.71 .",
    "such unanticipated variety and breadth has excited observers , theorists , and the public at large .    in parallel with this avalanche of planet discoveries",
    "are the multitude of recent brown dwarf discoveries in the field , in young clusters , and in binaries .",
    "more than 150 brown dwarfs are now known .",
    "in fact , estimates suggest that the number density of brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood is comparable to that of m dwarfs and that in most environments the mass function ( imf ) is still rising at the main sequence edge ( reid 1999 ) .",
    "though to date @xmath217 brown dwarfs have been discovered in binaries ( zuckerman and becklin 1992 ; rebolo 1998 ; basri and martin 1999 ; martin 1999 ; burgasser 2000 ; lowrance 1999 ; reid 2000b ) , most seem to inhabit the field .",
    "the growing library of brown dwarf spectra has led to the introduction of two entirely new `` stellar '' spectroscopic classes : the `` l '' dwarfs ( martin 1999 ; kirkpatrick 1999,2000 ; fan 2000 ; delfosse 1997 ; tinney 1998 ) and the `` t '' dwarfs ( burgasser 1999 ) . collectively , these new discoveries constitute a true renaissance in stellar and planetary astronomy that is becoming the research focus of a rapidly increasing fraction of the astronomical community .",
    "this review should be viewed as a modern supplement to the earlier review by burrows and liebert ( 1993 ) .",
    "the latter was written at a time when all brown dwarfs were mere `` candidates . ''",
    "moreover , it was written before the modern radial velocity data had transformed the study of planetary systems . in burrows and liebert ( 1993 ) ,",
    "the emphasis was on the relationship between the rudiments of theory ( the equation of state , simple boundary chemistry , the basics of `` stellar '' evolution ) and the generic features of brown dwarfs ( their radii , luminosities , effective temperatures ) .",
    "as such , there was little mention of the composition and chemistry of the atmospheres , egps , optical and infrared spectra and colors , and the host of other topics that are now the subject s modern concerns .",
    "all aspects of smo research are changing so rapidly that it would be unwise to attempt to survey in detail all the myriad subtopics that have emerged .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to concentrate in this review on a subset of representative topics that , not coincidently , are aligned with our own current research interests .",
    "in particular , we will not review in detail the spectra and models of m dwarfs , very - low - mass ( vlm ) stars , subdwarfs , low - metallicity stars , or young pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "excellent contributions on these topics can be found in dantona ( 1987 ) , allard and hauschildt ( 1995 ) , baraffe ( 1995 ) , allard ( 1997 ) , chabrier and baraffe ( 1997,2000 ) , and chabrier ( 2000a ) and the reader is encouraged to supplement our review with these papers .",
    "furthermore , we will not cover the many theories of planet or star formation . here , we cover various major theoretical topics concerning smos ( brown dwarfs and egps ) that have arisen during the last five years .",
    "these include , but are not limited to , brown dwarf / egp evolution , colors , and spectra , the molecular consistents of their atmospheres , t and l dwarf characteristics , reflection spectra , albedos , and transits , recent models of the jovian planets , the role and character of the dominant molecular opacities , and heavy - element depletion , rainout , and clouds .",
    "with such a full plate , we apologize in advance to both reader and colleague for omitting a favorite topic and beg their indulgence as we embark upon our survey of one of the hottest current topics in astrophysics .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what s in a name ?",

    "whatever the mass ( @xmath5 ) or origin of an extrasolar giant planet or brown dwarf , the same physics , chemistry , and compositions obtain for both .",
    "this fact is at the root of our ability to encompass both classes with a single theory .",
    "smo atmospheres are predominantly molecular , their cores are convective metallic hydrogen / helium mixtures for most combinations of mass and age , their emissions are mostly in the near infrared , and , though deuterium and lithium burning can play interesting roles , thermonuclear processes do nt dominate their evolution (  [ burn ] ) . after birth ,",
    "unless their luminosities ( @xmath6 ) are stabilized by stellar insolation , they cool off inexorably like dying embers plucked from a fire .",
    "figure [ lum.ps ] depicts the evolution of the luminosity of isolated solar - metallicity objects from 0.3 ( @xmath2 saturn ) to 0.2 ( @xmath3 1.0 solar mass @xmath3 1047 ) .",
    "distinguished by color are objects with masses equal to or below 13 ( red ) , objects above 13 and below the main sequence edge ( green ) , and stars above the main sequence edge ( blue ) .",
    "these color categories merely guide the eye and clarify what would otherwise be a figure difficult to parse .",
    "the 13 cutoff is near the deuterium - burning limit , but otherwise should not be viewed as being endowed with any overarching significance . in particular",
    ", objects below 13 that are born in the interstellar medium in a manner similar to the processes by which stars arise should be referred to as brown dwarfs .",
    "objects that are born in protostellar disks by processes that may differ from those that lead to stars ( perhaps after nucleating around a terrestrial superplanet ) should be referred to as planets .",
    "though theoretical prejudice suggests that such planets may not achieve masses near 13 , if they do so they are most sensibly called planets . hence , even if the mass distribution functions of egps and brown dwarfs overlap ( which they no doubt do ) , a distinction based upon mode of formation , and not mass , has compelling physical merit , despite the fact that we ca nt currently identify the history or origin of any given smo .",
    "there is no compelling need to type , define , or classify an smo immediately upon its discovery .",
    "it can be studied by all available means in the absence of a definitive box into which to put it . indeed",
    ", it is through the study and characterization of smos and with the help of theory that natural discriminants of `` planets '' will emerge , be they orbital , spectroscopic , rotational , or compositional . despite the fact that the press and populace are more fixated on `` planets '' than brown dwarfs , and some are overly interested in definitions , at this early stage in the study of smos we recommend that the active researcher maintain a healthy flexibility vis  vis nomenclature .",
    "figure [ lum.ps ] summarizes many aspects of the evolution of solar - metallicity smos with masses from 0.3 to 0.2 .",
    "the bifurcation between stars and brown dwarfs manifests itself only at late times ( @xmath7 yrs ) . at lower metallicities , the brown dwarf / star luminosity gap widens earlier and is more pronounced (  [ edge ] ) .",
    "after @xmath8 to @xmath9 years , stars stabilize at a luminosity for which the power derived from thermonuclear burning in the core compensates for the photon luminosity ( losses ) from the surface .",
    "brown dwarfs are those objects that do not burn light hydrogen at a rate sufficient to achieve this balance , though the more massive among them ( @xmath10 ) do burn light hydrogen for a time .",
    "figure [ tc.ps ] depicts the evolution of the central temperature ( @xmath11 ) ( for the same set of masses portrayed in fig .",
    "[ lum.ps ] ) . due to the negative specific heat effect for an ideal - gas object in hydrostatic equilibrium , radiative losses from the surface lead to an increase in the core temperatures and densities .",
    "this in turn drives the thermonuclear power up , while the total luminosity decreases .",
    "if the mass is sufficiently high , the thermonuclear power will eventually equal the total luminosity , the hallmark of a star .",
    "however , if the mass is too low , @xmath11 will not achieve a value sufficient for the thermonuclear power to balance surface losses before the core becomes electron - degenerate , after which time it will cool without compensation by compressional heating .",
    "figure [ tc.ps ] shows the rise and fall of @xmath11 for brown dwarfs .",
    "the peak @xmath11 is approximately @xmath12 ( m/0.05)@xmath13 . as fig .",
    "[ tc.ps ] shows , at the hydrogen burning main sequence edge mass ( hbmm ) , the temperature actually decreases before stabilizing .",
    "this is possible because the core density continues to increase after the peak @xmath11 is achieved , compensating in the thermonuclear rate for the slight decrease in @xmath11 .",
    "note that for solar metallicity @xmath11 at the hbmm is as low as @xmath14 k , the edge mass is near 0.075(depending upon the atmospheric opacities , in particular due to silicate grain opacity ) , the edge is @xmath21600 - 1750 k , and the edge luminosity is near @xmath15([edge ] ) .",
    "figure [ rad.ps ] portrays the evolution of the radius ( @xmath16 ) of a red dwarf , brown dwarf , or egp for the same set of masses employed in fig .",
    "[ lum.ps ] ( with the same color scheme ) .",
    "the early plateaus near two to six times jupiter s radius coincide with deuterium burning , which roughly stabilizes , @xmath6 , and @xmath16 for from a few@xmath17 years to @xmath18 years , depending upon the mass .",
    "the age when deuterium burning has consumed 50% of an object s stores of deuterium is indicated in fig .",
    "[ lum.ps ] by the golden dots .",
    "deuterium burning is responsible for the early bumps in fig .",
    "[ lum.ps ] at high @xmath6 , but , given the likely deuterium abundance ( @xmath19 ) , it never leads to a deuterium - burning main sequence .",
    "nevertheless , deuterium burning will have a measurable effect on the mass - function / luminosity - function mapping in young clusters and might result in a measurable depletion of deuterium in the atmospheres of older objects more massive than @xmath213 ( chabrier 2000b ) .",
    "deuterium burning is also responsible for the increased density of lines in the lower left hand corner of fig .",
    "[ tc.ps ] near @xmath20 k.    figure [ rad.ps ] demonstrates the evolution of radius with age and its non - monotonic dependence on mass .",
    "crudely , at early times the radius is a monotonically increasing function of mass and , for a given mass , the radius is always a decreasing function of age .",
    "however , at later times , the dependence of mass upon radius inverts , with the less massive smos having the larger radii . on the vlm main sequence , the radius of a star increases with mass ( @xmath21 ) . for a cold smo ,",
    "the peak radius is at a mass of @xmath24 ( zapolsky and salpeter 1969 ; hubbard 1977 ) .",
    "importantly , as fig .",
    "[ rad.ps ] shows , for a broad range of masses from 0.3 to 70 , the older radii are independent of mass to within about 30% .",
    "this fact results in a major simplification in our mental image of the class and is a consequence of the competition in the equation of state between coulomb and electron degeneracy effects .",
    "the former would set a fixed density and interparticle distance scale ( at @xmath2 1  ) which would lead to the relation : @xmath22 .",
    "the latter would of its own lead to the classic relationship for a low - mass white dwarf ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the competition between these two trends renders the radius constant over roughly two orders of magnitude in mass near the radius of jupiter , a feature of a polytrope of index 1.0 .    as fig .",
    "[ lum.ps ] shows , the late - time cooling phases for smos follow approximate power laws .",
    "indeed , basic solar - metallicity power - law relations which characterize older smos have been obtained ( burrows and liebert 1993 ; marley 1996 ) :    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the surface gravity in cgs units and @xmath30 is an average atmospheric rosseland mean opacity .",
    "different prescriptions for the atmospheric opacity ( _ e.g. _ , for silicate clouds ) and the equation of state , as well as different metallicities , will result in different numbers , but the basic systematics for the late - time evolution of smos is fully encapsulated in the above equations .",
    "note that if one drops the @xmath30 dependence and divides by @xmath24 , the luminosity relationship in eq .",
    "( [ powerl ] ) can be used for zero - metallicity smos ( saumon 1994 ; burrows 1993 ) .",
    "a better zero - metallicity fit is obtained if one substitutes the indices 1.25 and 2.4 for 1.3 and 2.64 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding zero - metallicity formula for is obtained by substituting 1140 k for 1550 k in eq .",
    "( [ powert ] ) , with the indices 0.31 and 0.77 substituted for 0.32 and 0.83 , respectively .",
    "the analytic formulae in eqs .",
    "( [ powerl]-[powerr ] ) allow one to derive any quantity from any two other quantities , for a given @xmath30 or metallicity ( z ) . given a composition , the egp / brown dwarf continuum is a _",
    "two_-parameter family that spans two orders of magnitude in mass , three orders of magnitude in age , and more than one and a half orders of magnitude in effective temperature from @xmath280 k to @xmath23000 k.    a power - law relationship can be derived linking luminosity and mass on the lower main sequence ( see fig .",
    "[ lum.ps ] ) . for solar metallicity , burrows and liebert ( 1993 )",
    "obtain : @xmath31 a comparision of eq .",
    "( [ above ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ powerl ] ) reveals that the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath5 is slightly steeper below the main sequence than above .",
    "the properties of stars at the main sequence edge are a function of helium fraction ( @xmath32 ) , metallicity , and the opacity of the clouds of silicate grains that characterize l dwarf atmospheres with near 1400 - 2000 k (  [ spectra ] ) . a large grain opacity ( perhaps due to smaller average particle size ) ,",
    "high helium fractions , and higher metallicity lead to lower edge masses ( hbmm ) , edge , and edge luminosities .",
    "the higher helium fraction leads to a more compact object , with a larger central temperature and density , all else being equal .",
    "larger opacities translate into optically thicker atmospheric blankets that do two things : 1 ) they produce higher central temperatures by steepening the temperature gradient and 2 ) they decrease the energy leakage rate ( luminosity ) from the surface . the former enhances the thermonuclear rate while the latter makes it easier to achieve main - sequence power balance at a lower mass .",
    "hence , the hbmm at solar metallicity and @xmath33 is @xmath20.07 - 0.074 ( hayashi and nakano 1963 ; kumar 1963 ) , with a t@xmath34 of 1700 - 1750 k and an @xmath35 of @xmath36 , while the hbmm at zero metallicity is @xmath37 , with a t@xmath34 of @xmath23600 k and an @xmath35 of @xmath38 ( saumon 1994 ) .",
    "the derivative , @xmath39 , is approximately equal to @xmath40 .",
    "however , as implied above , uncertainties in silicate grain physics and opacities leave us with ambiguities in the hbmm , its , and @xmath6 . as a consequence ,",
    "the effective temperature at the hbmm might be as low as 1600 k ( baraffe 1995 ; chabrier and baraffe 2000 ; chabrier 2000a ) .",
    "however , whatever the role of silicate clouds at the main sequence edge , a solar - metallicity edge object is an l dwarf .",
    "( we will discuss l dwarfs in greater detail in  [ observed ] . ) the edge characteristics and the late boundary of the l dwarfs both depend upon the persistence and properties of silicate grains . as an added consequence , the width in space of the l dwarf sequence is probably an increasing function of metallicity .",
    "if the edge of the main sequence is an l dwarf , then only a fraction of the l dwarfs are substellar . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us turn to the case of the prototypical l dwarf , gd 165b . with a spectral class of l4 ,",
    "this object is in the middle of the l scale ( kirkpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "since gd 165a is a white dwarf with a of @xmath211,000 k , gd 165b is a long - lived object ; the white dwarf cooling age requires a systemic age of @xmath2 1.0 gyr . since the white dwarf mass estimated from the surface gravity",
    "is not particularly high , a nuclear lifetime of at least a few gyrs is indicated for the white dwarf progenitor .",
    "the trigonometric parallax of the primary allows the determination of gd 165b s absolute @xmath41 magnitude ( m@xmath42 = 13.31@xmath430.18 ) and it is fainter than that of any m dwarf .",
    "this puts a very strong constraint on its mass : if it is not a main sequence star , a prolonged period of nuclear burning is required for it not to have cooled to a much lower luminosity .",
    "therefore , gd 165b s mass could be around 0.07 - 0.075 ( for solar composition ) .",
    "reid ( 1999 ) addressed the current ambiguity in the fraction of l dwarfs that are substellar by utilizing observations of the lithium line ( 6708   in the red spectrum ) in the so - called  lithium test \" ( rebolo , martin , and magazzu 1992 ;  [ burn ] ) .",
    "about one third of the 2mass l dwarfs show detections of lithium .",
    "these arguably have masses below the 0.06 - 0.065 mass limit for the interior to be hot enough for lithium burning ( see fig . [ yl ] below ) .",
    "if lithium is depleted in these completely convective objects , the mass is above this value .",
    "this expectation is nicely vindicated for gd 165b by the small upper limit ( 0.7  ) to the equivalent width of the lithium line measured by kirkpatrick ( 1999 ) , though the proximity of its stellar companion slightly complicates the interpretation .    that the hbmm is a weak function of metallicity was demonstrated analytically by burrows and liebert ( 1993 ) , who derived an approximate formula : @xmath44 where @xmath30 is an ersatz for metallicity .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that the hbmm ranges from 0.092 to only 0.07 as z changes by orders of magnitude .",
    "however , and @xmath6 at a given mass and age can vary significantly with z. figure [ lm.metal ] shows @xmath45-year @xmath6@xmath5 isochrones as a function of metallicity for two opacity prescriptions ( alexander and ferguson 1994 ; allard and hauschildt 1995 ) , as calculated by burrows ( 1998 ) ( using the atmospheric boundary conditions provided by didier saumon ) .",
    "included is the zero - metallicity isochrone from burrows ( 1993 ) .",
    "red dwarf stars are in the top right and brown dwarfs are in the bottom left .",
    "note that the transition region is a sensitive function of metallicity , as is the luminosity at a given mass in both the stellar and substellar regimes .",
    "note also that @xmath6 is a decreasing function of metallicity above the hbmm , but an increasing function of metallicity below it .",
    "low metallicity means low opacity that allows a brown dwarf to cool more quickly . by the same token",
    ", low opacity allows one to see more deeply into stabilized stars to higher temperature layers , making subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs more luminous .",
    "the corresponding t@xmath34-@xmath5 isochrones demonstrate the same systematics and are provided in fig .",
    "[ tm.metal ] .",
    "observers probing the edge of the main sequence do so in magnitude space .",
    "it is interesting to note that at the solar - metallicity edge m@xmath46 , m@xmath47 , and m@xmath48 are @xmath219.5 , @xmath218 , and @xmath211.5 , respectively , but at the zero - metallicity edge they are 12.8 , 12.0 , and 11.1 . in @xmath49 and @xmath16 ,",
    "the edge varies by 6 - 7 magnitudes over this metallicity range , but , curiously , @xmath50 is roughly the same .",
    "this is a consequence of the importance even when there are no metals of collision - induced absorption ( cia ) by h@xmath51 at 2.2 (  [ moleopac ] ) and is an interesting fixed point in vlm / smo theory .",

    "furthermore , in the mid- to late - t dwarf regime ( bounded below by the `` water cloud '' class , see  [ chem ] ) , lithium is in molecular form ( mostly licl ; see  [ chem ] ) and can not be identified by the presence of the 6708   atomic line .",

[ elem : abund ] and table [ anders ] speaks volumes about which elements / compounds dominate in smo atmospheres . after hydrogen ( in the form of h@xmath51 ) and helium , the reason for the importance of o / c / n compounds is manifest in fig .",
    "[ elem : abund ] .",
    "figure [ comp.gl229b ] portrays the abundance profiles in a gl 229b model of the dominant o / c / n molecules ( h@xmath51o , co , ch@xmath63 , n@xmath51 , and nh@xmath64 ) and is quite representative for smo atmospheres .",
    "neon is inert , both chemically and spectroscopically , but mg and si are abundant .",
    "the fact that they are more abundant than ca and al means that even if all the ca / al is sequestered in compounds there is excess mg and si available to form mg / si / o compounds . since ca and al silicates are generally more refractory than mg@xmath51sio@xmath63 ( forsterite ) and mgsio@xmath64 ( enstatite ) , they and their compounds are expected to settle and `` rain out '' first at high temperatures ( 1800 - 2500 k ) . since mg ,",
    "si , and o are in ample supply in a solar mix , enstatite and forsterite will be expected at lower temperatures , higher up in the atmospheres .",
    "hence , they may be expected to dominate in most of the silicate clouds `` seen '' in smo atmospheres , perhaps for spectral subtypes later than the early ls .",
    "the overwhelming presence of hydrogen ensures that the light hydrides ( h@xmath51o , ch@xmath63 , nh@xmath64 , h@xmath51s ) as well as the heavier hydrides ( _ e.g. _ , feh , crh , cah , mgh ) play roles . at low metallicities , the latter will be even more common .",
    "in fact , all of these compounds have been detected in either l or t dwarfs or in jupiter ( h@xmath51s ) .",
    "since c / o is less than one , hydrocarbon chemistry is not expected , unless uv - driven non - equilibrium processes , such as are expected in irradiated egps , occur .",
    "hence , carbon is in the form of co at high temperatures and low pressures and of ch@xmath63 at low temperatures and high pressures .",
    "the pressure dependence of the co / ch@xmath63 ratio is a straightforward consequence of le chtelier s principle , given the reaction ch@xmath63 + h@xmath51o @xmath69 co + 3h@xmath51 .",
    "( however , noll , geballe , and marley ( 1997 ) have shown that the abundance of co in gl 229b is enhanced above the expected equilibrium value , perhaps due to disequilibrium kinetics driven by the speed of convective upwelling . )",
    "oxygen is predominantly in the form of water and co , but is available in sufficient abundance to enable the formation of a variety of oxides , mostly at higher temperatures ( _ e.g. _ , al@xmath51o@xmath64 , tio , vo , sio(g ) ) .",
    "tio and vo are so spectroscopically active that they are used to define the m dwarf sequence in the optical and near ir ( see  [ spectra ] and fig .",
    "[ opac.sum ] in  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "their disappearance near the m / l border ( tio near 2000 - 2200 k and vo near 1800 k ) helps to announce and define the l dwarfs . at lower temperatures ,",
    "they either condense out directly ( vo ) or form condensable solids ( for m dwarfs : catio@xmath64 [ perovskite ] , for l / t dwarfs : ti@xmath64o@xmath70 , ti@xmath51o@xmath64 ) .",
    "feh and crh are seen in late m dwarfs and are present in l dwarfs and m subdwarfs .",
    "chemistry implies that crh will persist to lower temperatures ( @xmath21500 k ) than feh ( @xmath22000 - 2200 k ) .",
    "however , the line lists for both compounds are incomplete and this translates into errors in their partition functions and free energies .",
    "the upshot might be that feh in particular should persist to even lower temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the predominant reservoir of iron below 2300 k should be metallic fe droplets , which are thermodynamically favored over feh at these temperatures .",
    "these droplets should settle ( rain out ) in the gravitational field and reside in a cloud near the 2000 - 2200 k level ( even in jupiter ) , depleting the upper smo atmospheres of iron and iron compounds ( fegley and lodders 1994 ; burrows and sharp 1999 ) .",
    "being more refractory than enstatite and forsterite , this cloud should undergird most of the silicate cloud layers . since fes is the preferred form of iron below temperatures of @xmath2750 k and s",
    "does not form refractory compounds above such a temperature , if iron did not rain out at depth , we would not see h@xmath51s in jupiter s atmosphere ( fegley and lodders 1994 ) .",
    "sulfur would be in the form of fes .",
    "however , in fact we do see abundant h@xmath51s in jupiter s atmosphere and this implies that iron did indeed rain out to depth in the atmospheres of the jovian planets and is not available to scavenge sulfur at altitude .",
    "similarly , iron will rain out in l and t dwarfs and h@xmath51s is their major sulfur reservoir .    as shown by burrows and sharp ( 1999 ) , fegley and lodders ( 1996 ) , and lodders ( 1999 ) ,",
    "the alkali metals are less refractory than ti , v , ca , si , al , fe , and mg and survive in abundance as neutral atoms in substellar atmospheres to temperatures of 1000 k to 1500 k. this is below the 1600 k to 2500 k temperature range in which the silicates , iron , the titanates , corundum ( al@xmath51o@xmath64 ) , and spinel ( mgal@xmath51o@xmath63 ) , etc .",
    "condense and rain out .",
    "the rainout of refractory elements such as silicon and aluminum ensures that na and k are not sequestered in the feldspars high albite ( naalsi@xmath64o@xmath65 ) and sanidine ( kalsi@xmath64o@xmath65 ) at temperatures at and below 1400 k , but are in their elemental form down to @xmath21000 k. hence , in the depleted atmospheres of the cool t dwarfs and late l dwarfs , alkali metals quite naturally come into their own .",
    "figures [ rainout ] and [ norain ] demonstrate the role of rainout by depicting the profiles of the relative abundances of the main reservoirs of the alkali metals , with and without rainout as crudely defined in burrows and sharp ( 1999 ) .",
    "as is clear from a comparison of these two figures , rainout and depletion of heavy metals can result in a significant enhancement in the abundances at altitude ( lower temperatures ) of the neutral alkali metal atoms , in particular sodium and potassium . figures [ rainout ] and [ norain ] indicate that the alkali metals na , k , li , and cs ( and presumably rb ) form chlorides , hydroxides , and sulfides below temperatures of 1500 - 1700 k. the and gravities at which this happens depends upon the specific atmospheric temperature / pressure profiles , the character and efficiency of rainout , and the basic chemistry .",
    "this implies that the strengths of the alkali atomic lines , so important in l and t dwarfs ( see  [ shape ] ,  [ spectra ] , and  [ determ ] ) , eventually diminish , but that they diminish in a specific order .",
    "moreover , the coldest t dwarfs and `` water cloud '' dwarfs at even lower should have weak alkali lines .",
    "figure [ profile : cloud ] depicts various condensation or chemical equilibrium / transition lines for the alkali chlorides , enstatite / forsterite , some ti compounds , and the major o / c / n compounds . superposed",
    "are atmospheric temperature / pressure profiles from burrows ( 1997 ) for 1-gyr brown dwarfs and red dwarfs and for jupiter .",
    "the intersection point of a given condensation curve with an smo s t / p profile indicates the likely position of the corresponding cloud base .",
    "as expected , nh@xmath64 and h@xmath51o clouds form at low temperatures and pressures and silicate clouds form at high temperatures and pressures . since the t / p profile of a low - mass , old smo is associated with a low - entropy core adiabat , clouds form at higher pressures in low - mass and/or older brown dwarfs / egps .",

    "the more refractory condensates whose condensation points lie well below the photosphere still play an important role in depleting the observed atmosphere of a number of abundant elements , _",

    "the almost complete absence of spectral signatures of metal oxides ( such as tio and vo ) in gliese 229b and the other t dwarfs is in keeping with theoretical expectations ( burrows and sharp 1999 ; fegley and lodders 1996 ) that these species are depleted ( `` rained out '' ) in the atmospheres of all but the youngest ( hence , hottest ) substellar objects and are sequestered in condensed form below the photosphere ( burrows , marley , and sharp 2000 ; marley  1996 ; allard  1996 ; tsuji  1996 ) .    however , the direct effect of clouds on the emergent fluxes of egps and brown dwarfs in the important t@xmath34 range below 2000 k has yet to be properly addressed .",
    "clouds can partially fill in spectral troughs and smooth spectral features ( jones and tsuji 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , the presence or absence of clouds can strongly affect the reflection spectra and albedos of egps .",
    "in particular , when there are clouds at or above the photosphere , the albedo in the optical is high .",
    "conversely , when clouds are absent , the albedo in the mostly absorbing atmosphere is low .",
    "condensed species in brown dwarf and egp atmospheres range from ammonia ice in low temperature objects to silicate and iron grains at high temperatures .",
    "clearly , the physical properties of the variety of smo clouds ( _ i.e. _ , their particle modal size and distribution , the amount of condensate , and their morphology and spatial extent ) are important and central challenges for the brown dwarf theorist .    unfortunately , cloud particle sizes are not easily modeled and are a strong function of the unknown meteorology in smo atmospheres .",
    "inferred particle sizes in solar system giant planet atmospheres can guide brown dwarf and egp models , though they range widely from fractions of a micron to tens of microns .",
    "importantly , atmospheric dynamics can lead to dramatic changes in the mean particle sizes .",
    "in particular , convective processes lead to growth in the mean particle size . in the case of water and magnesium silicates ,",
    "the latent heat of condensation increases the mean upwelling velocity and can exaggerate these effects , as quantified by lunine  ( 1989 ) .",
    "the simple model of the transport processes in magnesium silicate clouds presented in lunine  suggests particle sizes in the range of 10 - 100 are possible by coalescence , much larger than the micron ",
    "sized particles one would assume from simple condensation .    for a one - dimensional cloud model ,",
    "the particle size , its shape distribution , and the amount of condensate ( for a given set of potentially condensable gas - phase constituents ) are sufficient to compute the effect of clouds at a given level on the atmospheric thermal balance , if one knows the optical properties of the condensate itself . in the model of lunine ( 1989 ) ,",
    "growth rates for particles and droplets were calculated at each t / p level using analytic expressions for growth rates ( rossow 1978 ) .",
    "the lunine model assumes that the atmospheric thermal balance at each level is dominated by a modal particle size that is the maximum attainable when growth rates are exceeded by the sedimentation , or rainout rate , of the particles . because the sedimentation rate increases monotonically with particle size , this must happen at and above some particle size .",
    "the amount of condensate was assumed proportional to the vapor pressure at each level .",
    "such a criterion represents a rough estimate for particle size and condensable in an environment in which upwelling ( due , for example , to convection ) is not present . in convective environments",
    ", lunine altered the criterion for maximum particle size to be that at which the upwelling velocity matched the particle sedimentation velocity .",
    "the condensable material available at each level is no longer proportional to the vapor pressure itself , because particles are wafted across levels by convection .",
    "lunine assumed the condensate load at each level had the altitude profile @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the scale height and @xmath73 the altitude .",
    "this is almost certainly an overestimate ( see below ) .",
    "the advantage of this model is that few parameters need to be specified for a given brown dwarf or egp : t , p , condensable species and associated thermodynamic parameters , convective flux or mean upwelling velocity ( hence , mixing length ) , and ancillary physical constants .",
    "marley ( 1999 ) modified the model described above to allow for a particle size distribution , not calculated explicitly but assuming a gaussian about some modal particle size , and explicitly expressed the condensate density in terms of the amount of vapor exceeding the saturation vapor pressure at a given altitude .",
    "because particles and droplets have surface tension , a real atmosphere on the verge of forming clouds will always have some modest supersaturation .",
    "vapor pressures at the cloud base may range from 1.01 times the saturation vapor pressure ( for earth ) to as much as twice the vapor pressure under certain conditions in cold planetary atmospheres .",
    "the amount of condensate at each level is then just enough to bring the coexisting partial pressure of condensables to exactly the vapor pressure .",
    "ackerman and marley ( 2000 ) have gone a step further by explicitly including the mass balance between upwardly diffusing vapor and downward sedimentation ( rainout ) of condensate .",
    "this allows an amount of condensate at each level that is not tied directly to an assumed value of the supersaturation , which can not be calculated a priori for a given atmosphere ( though it can be estimated ) .",
    "however , in the ackerman and marley ( 2000 ) model , there is an adjustable parameter which is the mass - weighted sedimentation velocity expressed relative to the mean convective velocity .",
    "while the model can be fitted to jovian ( for example ) cloud properties , the sedimentation parameter can not be specified a priori via the properties of the atmosphere .",
    "an extension of the above models in convective regions is to include plume models to calculate upwelling velocities and condensate loading at each level .",
    "a first effort at this with a simple one - dimensional moist entraining plume model was made for brown dwarfs by lunine ( 1989 ) , based on a model for jupiter s clouds by stoker ( 1986 ) .",
    "to extend any of the above models to more than a single dimension will in fact require numerical plume models , as has been done by yair ( 1995 ) for jupiter .",
    "once launched in that direction , a number of parameters required for numerical convective cloud models will need to be specified from auxiliary theoretical models or just assumed , because they can not be inferred directly from current observations of l dwarfs , t dwarfs , or even jupiter .",
    "nonetheless , it is evident from the study of jupiter that heterogeneous cloud distributions , in the areal sense , may be the standard state for egp s under at least some conditions . in such circumstances",
    ", one - dimensional cloud models may overestimate the effect of clouds in one sense ( by not accounting for emergent flux unmolested by clouds ) and underestimating the effect in others ( by not allowing for a population of multi - scale - height convective cloud masses ) . in this",
    "regard , tinney and tolley ( 1999 ) and bailer - jones and mundt ( 2000 ) have recently seen photometric variations in red dwarfs and l dwarfs that are best interpreted in the context of temporal variations in large patchy cloud structures .",
    "bailer - jones and mundt ( 2000 ) claim that the later spectral types ( ls ) are more likely to manifest such variations , lending credence to the hypothesis that condensates ( expected at lower temperatures ) , not magnetic star spots ( expected for earlier spectral types ) , are responsible .    despite the still primitive nature of cloud modeling , it is clear that the stacking order and importance of silicate / iron clouds between 1500 k and 2400 k , chloride / sulfide hazes below @xmath21000 k , water clouds near 300 k , and ammonia clouds below 200 k , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ profile : cloud ] , are robust theoretical expectations .",
    "indeed , silicate / iron clouds characterize the l dwarfs .",

    "it is characterized by emission spikes through the brown dwarf s water absorption bands at @xmath82 , @xmath41 , @xmath72 , and @xmath50 , strong absorption at the 3.3 feature of methane , the characteristic methane feature at 1.7 on the red side of the @xmath72 band , and alkali metal absorption lines shortward of one micron .",
    "the importance of the neutral alkali metals (  [ chem ] and  [ shape ] ) led burrows , marley , and sharp ( 2000 , bms ) to conclude that the strong continuum absorption seen in all t dwarf spectra in the near - infrared from 0.8 to 1.0 , previously interpreted as due to an anomalous population of red grains ( griffith , yelle , and marley 1998 ) or in part due to high - altitude silicate clouds ( tsuji 1999 ; allard 1997 ) , is in fact most probably due to the strong red wings of the k i doublet at @xmath27700  .",
    "figure [ gl229b.k ] from bms demonstrates the naturalness with which the potassium resonance lines alone fit the observed near - infrared / optical spectrum of gl 229b ( leggett 1999 ; though note the caveats in  [ shape ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ gl229b.k ] , four theoretical models with about the same luminosity and core entropy ( roughly satisfying the relation @xmath164 const . )",
    "are compared to the leggett ( 1999 ) calibration of the gl 229b data shortward of 1.45 .",
    "curiously , in the metal - depleted atmospheres of t dwarfs the reach of the k i doublet is one of the broadest in astrophysics , its far wings easily extending more than 1500   to the red and blue . with rainout , below @xmath21000",
    "k sodium and potassium exist as sulfides or chlorides ( na@xmath51s and kcl / k@xmath51s ) ( lodders 1999 ) . without rainout ,",
    "complete chemical equilibrium at low temperatures requires that sodium and potassium reside in the feldspars . if such compounds formed and persisted at altitude , then the nascent alkali metals would be less visible , particularly in t dwarfs . by modeling spectra with and without the rainout of the refractories and comparing to the emerging library of t dwarf spectra ( _ e.g. _ , burgasser 1999,2000 ; leggett 2000a ; mclean 2000 ) , the degree of rainout and the composition profiles of brown dwarf atmospheres can be approximately ascertained .",
    "the 1.17 and 1.24 subordinate lines of excited k i have also been identified in t dwarfs ( strauss 1999 ; tsvetanov 1999 ; mclean 2000 ) . since these subordinate lines are on the crown of the @xmath41 band , they allow one to probe the deeper layers at higher temperatures .",
    "figure [ bright ] portrays for a representative gl 229b model the dependence on wavelength of the `` brightness '' temperature , here defined as the temperature at which the photon optical depth ( @xmath148 ) is @xmath165 .",
    "such plots clearly reveal the temperature layers probed with spectra and provide a means to qualitatively gauge composition profiles .",
    "specifically , for the gl 229b model the detection of the subordinate lines of potassium indicates that we are probing to @xmath21550 k , while the detection of the fundamental methane band at @xmath166 means that we are probing to only @xmath2600 k.    as fig .",
    "[ gl229b.k ] suggests , the bms theory also explains the wfpc2 @xmath167 band ( m@xmath16820.76 ; theory = 21.0 ) and @xmath16 band ( @xmath169 ; theory = 23.6 ) measurements made of gl 229b ( golimowski 1998 ) , with the na d lines at 5890   helping to determine the strength of the @xmath16 band .",
    "bms predicted not only that there would be a large trough in a t dwarf spectrum at 7700   due to the k i resonance , but that the spectrum of a t dwarf would peak between the na d and k i absorption troughs at 5890   and 7700  , respectively .",
    "this prediction was recently verified by liebert ( 2000 ) for the t dwarf sdss 1624 + 00 and recapitulates the behavior seen in fig . [ 1507 ] for late l dwarfs .    since in brown dwarfs the distributions and relative depths of the alkali metals",
    "depend systematically upon and @xmath29 , the alkali metal lines , along with h@xmath51o , ch@xmath63 , and h@xmath51 bands in the near infrared , may soon be used to probe the atmospheric structure of t dwarfs .",
    "marley ( 1996 ) and allard ( 1996 ) analyzed the full spectrum of gl 229b from the @xmath41 band ( @xmath21.2 ) through the @xmath170 band ( @xmath210 ) , but could constrain its gravity to within no better than a factor of two .",
    "such gravity error bars are large and translate into a factor of @xmath22 uncertainty in gl 229b s inferred mass and age . however , with the new keck , ukirt , het , and vlt observations ( for example ) and our emerging understanding of what determines the optical and infrared spectra , we can now hope to obtain tighter constraints on t dwarf gravities , and , hence , masses . in particular , due to the differential dependence on pressure of the ch@xmath63 and h@xmath51 opacities , as well as the shifting competition between the h@xmath51o / h@xmath51/ch@xmath63 band strengths and the alkali line strengths with changing and @xmath29 , the near ir spectra from 1.1 to 2.3 , the @xmath152 color , and the continuum shape from 0.7 to 0.95 can be used to break the degeneracy in the /gravity / composition fits .",
    "what is being revealed is that the t dwarfs discovered to date span a wide range in age , in mass ( perhaps @xmath220 to @xmath270 ) , and in ( perhaps @xmath2700 k to @xmath21200 k ) .",
    "curiously , since the na d lines can be prominent in brown dwarf spectra and will suppress the green wavelengths and since the color `` brown '' is two parts red , one part green , and very little blue , brown dwarfs should not be brown .",
    "in fact , recent calculations suggest that they are red to purple , depending upon the exact shape of the line wings of na d , the abundance of the alkalis , the presence of high - altitude clouds , and the role of water clouds at lower ( @xmath66 500 k ) . a mixture of red and the complementary color to the yellow of the na d line makes physical sense .",
    "it is the _ complementary _ color , not the _ color _ , of the na d line(s ) because na d is seen in absorption , not emission .",
    "indeed , the recent measurement of the spectrum of the l5 dwarf 2massw j1507 from 0.4  to 1.0 ( fig . [ 1507 ] ; reid 2000a ) indicates that this l dwarf is magenta in ( optical ) color .",
    "this is easily shown with a program that generates the rgb equivalent of a given optical spectrum ( in this instance , r : g : b::1.0:0.3:0.42 , depending upon the video `` gamma '' ) . hence , after a quarter century of speculation and ignorance , we now have a handle on the true color of a brown dwarf  and it is not brown .",
    "as is becoming increasingly clear , brown dwarfs are prevalent in the galactic disk , though they contribute little to the galactic mass budget .",
    "not only are isolated brown dwarfs numerous in the solar neighborhood , they are also numerous in galactic disk clusters .",
    "many brown dwarfs have been found down to masses near or below 10 in the young @xmath171 ori cluster ( zapatero - osorio 2000 ) . in the pleiades ,",
    "brown dwarfs have been found down to as far as @xmath20.035 ( @xmath235 ) ( martin 1998 ) .",
    "bouvier ( 1998 ) find that the pleiades imf is still rising in the substellar domain , with a slope consistent with an imf ( @xmath172 ) that is proportional to @xmath173 . indeed , for several very young clusters spanning nearly two orders of magnitude in stellar density ( ic348 , l1495e , @xmath144 oph , and the orion nebula cluster ) , luhman ( 2000 ) determine substellar imfs that are flat or slowly rising with decreasing mass .",
    "furthermore , the initial assessment of the l dwarf sample from 2mass suggests that the field mass function could be similar to those of the clusters ( reid 1999 ) .    of particular importance",
    "is the discovery of brown dwarfs in binary systems .",
    "evidence has been accumulating that the binary frequency declines with decreasing stellar mass , from the 60% or greater for solar - type stars ( duquennoy and mayor 1991 ) to @xmath235% for m dwarfs ( fischer and marcy 1992 ; reid and gizis 1997 ) .",
    "substellar - mass companions to solar - type stars have generally not been found in radial velocity surveys ; this is the so - called `` brown dwarf desert '' ( marcy and butler 1998 ) .",
    "several ground and space - based studies reach similar conclusions : m dwarfs do not seem to harbor close brown dwarf companions . however , brown dwarfs are not so uncommon as wide companions ( @xmath17410 a.u . ) over a broad range of spectral type ( g  m ) and mass ( kirkpatrick 2001 ) .",
    "likewise , the frequency of brown dwarf pairs is appreciable  perhaps 20% ( reid 2000b ) .",

    "several physical processes in an egp s atmosphere are potentially important for determining the transit radius : rayleigh scattering , refraction , molecular absorption , and cloud scattering .",

    ". the brown ( 2000 ) error on the transit radius for an equivalent opaque occulting disk of @xmath189 is still more than twice the uncertainty due to details of the atmospheric structure ( the atmospheric scale height in hd209458b might be @xmath20.01 ) .",
    "however , with improved measurements of the transit lightcurve due to repeated observations , atmospheric details will ultimately play a role in the interpretation of the data .",
    "such large radii for close - in egps were predicted by guillot ( 1996 ) .",
    "importantly , since hd209458b transits its primary , astronomers can derive @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) , from which the planet s mass ( @xmath20.69 ) can be directly determined .",
    "the ability to pin down more than one structural parameter for a given egp is a milestone in the emerging study of extrasolar planets and a harbinger of what can be expected as the list of known close - in egps grows .    as zapolsky and salpeter ( 1969 ) demonstrated for planets made of high-@xmath82 material , any planet with a cold radius larger than @xmath20.75 , must be made predominantly of hydrogen . using the aneos equation of state tables ( thompson 1990 ) , burrows ( 2000 ) derive that an `` olivine '' ( rock ) or h@xmath51o ( ice ) planet with a mass of 0.69 has a radius of 0.31 or 0.45 , respectively .",
    "importantly , these radii are 34 times smaller than observed for hd209458b and prove that hd209458b must be a hydrogen - rich gas giant ; it can not be a giant terrestrial planet or an ice giant such as neptune or uranus .",

    "burrows ( 2000 ) also found that hd209458b s large radius is not due to mere thermal expansion of its atmosphere ( @xmath21% ) , but is due to the high residual entropy that remains throughout its bulk by dint of its early proximity to the luminous primary .",
    "the large stellar flux does not inflate the planet , but retards its otherwise inexorable contraction from a more extended configuration at birth .",
    "essentially , irradiation flattens the temperature profile at the top of the convective zone , while at the same time moving the radiative / convective boundary inward .",
    "since radiative fluxes are governed by the product of thermal diffusivities and temperature gradients and since the thermal diffusivity decreases with increasing pressure ( @xmath192 ) , the flux of energy out of the convective core and the rate of core entropy change are reduced .",
    "the upshot is a retardation of the contraction of the planet .",
    "high stellar fluxes on a close - in egp can have profound structural consequences .",

    "[ transit.rad ] , there is a great difference between the theoretical radius of an isolated and of an irradiated egp .",

    "it is at such ages that the radius of an isolated 0.69-egp falls below hd209458b s observed radius .",

    "albedo , @xmath199 , is the ratio of the total reflected and total incident powers .",
    "it is obtained by weighting the spherical albedo by the spectrum of the illuminating source and integrating over all wavelengths .",
    "this is the quantity with which the equilibrium temperature of an irradiated planet is determined . ignoring internal luminosity and assuming that the planet reradiates equally into @xmath200 steradians , the equilibrium temperature is equal to @xmath201 ( table [ beast ] ) , where t@xmath202 and @xmath203 are the effective temperature and radius , respectively , of the primary star .",
    "spherical , geometric , and bond albedos of objects are strong functions of their compositions . within the solar system , they vary substantially with wavelength , and from object to object . at short wavelengths ,",
    "gaseous atmospheres can have high albedos due to rayleigh scattering and low albedos at longer wavelengths due to molecular ro - vibrational absorption .",
    "due to water and methane absorption , the latter should be the case for cloudless egps .",
    "icy condensates , whether they reside on a surface or are present in an upper atmosphere , are highly reflective and increase the albedo .",
    "other condensates , such as silicates or non - equilibrium products of photolysis , can lower the albedo , but longward of @xmath204 most clouds at altitude raise albedos substantially .    the theoretical study of egp albedos and reflection spectra is still largely in its infancy . marley ( 1999 )",
    "explored a range of egp geometric and bond albedos using temperature - pressure profiles of egps in isolation ( _ i.e. _ , no stellar insolation ) , while goukenleuque ( 2000 ) modeled 51 peg b in radiative equilibrium and seager and sasselov ( 1998 ) explored radiative - convective models of egps under strong stellar insolation .",
    "the theoretical reflection spectra generated by goukenleuque ( 2000 ) and by seager , whitney , and sasselov ( 2000 ) are particularly informative .",
    "figure [ seager ] from the latter depicts a full - phase spectrum of the close - in egp 51 peg b. the water , methane , and alkali metal absorption features are clearly in evidence and will be primary diagnostics of this planet when it is finally directly detected .",
    "the ratio of the planet s flux to the star s flux is given by :    @xmath205    where @xmath196 is the geometric albedo , @xmath4 is the planet s semi - major axis , @xmath85 is given by the expression @xmath206 , @xmath207 is the orbital inclination angle , @xmath208 is the orbital phase ( from 0 to 1 ) , and @xmath209 is the phase function normalized to 1 at full phase ( @xmath197 ; @xmath210 ) . for a lambert sphere , @xmath211 and for jupiter at @xmath212  @xmath213 .",
    "the most important feature of eq . ( [ lambert ] ) is the geometric factor @xmath214 , which for 51 peg b is @xmath215 .",
    "seager , whitney , and sasselov ( 2000 ) explored the angular phase functions of egps in reflection and demonstrated that , due in part to forward scattering by large cloud particles , the range of phase angles for which the reflection is high can be significantly more narrow than what the simple lambert phase function ( @xmath216 ) gives .",
    "hence , in the early stages of direct detection campaigns , one does not want to observe far away from full phase .",
    "sbp recently attempted to establish a general understanding of the systematics of the albedo and reflection spectra of egps , tying them to their overall compositions and clouds . for those preliminary calculations , sbp defined five representative composition classes based loosely on t@xmath217",
    "the classification of egps into five composition classes , related to t@xmath217 , is instructive , since it can be shown that the albedos of objects within each of these classes exhibit similar features and values .",
    "the `` jovian '' class i objects ( t@xmath218 150 k ) are characterized by the presence of ammonia clouds and gaseous methane . in somewhat warmer objects ( t@xmath217 @xmath219 250",
    "k ) , ammonia is in its gaseous state , but the upper troposphere contains condensed h@xmath51o .",
    "these objects are designated class ii , or `` water cloud , '' egps and also contain a large abundance of gaseous methane .",
    "class iii , or `` clear '' egps , are so named because they are too hot ( t@xmath220 500 k ) for significant h@xmath51o condensation and so are not expected to have clouds in their atmospheres .",
    "absorption by gaseous water , methane , molecular hydrogen ( via cia ) , and neutral alkali metals , together with the absence of dominating cloud layers , give class iii egps the lowest bond and geometric albedos of any class .",
    "in hotter egps ( 900 k @xmath66 t@xmath217 @xmath66 1500 k ; class iv ) the troposphere is expected to contain significant abundances of absorbing neutral sodium and potassium gases above a silicate cloud layer and the albedo will be low . however , the hottest ( t@xmath220 1500 ) and/or least massive egps with low gravities ( g @xmath221 cm s@xmath222 ) have a silicate layer located so high in the atmosphere that much of the incoming radiation is reflected back out into space before being absorbed by neutral alkali metals or molecules ( seager and sasselov 1998 ) .",
    "sbp designated these highly reflective egps class v. hence , sbp concluded that neither the bond nor the geometric albedos of egps are monotonic with t@xmath217 .",
    "for instance , around a g2v star , the bond albedos are @xmath20.5 , @xmath20.8 , @xmath20.1 , @xmath20.03 , and @xmath20.55 for classes i through v. van de hulst ( 1974 ) has derived a useful analytic expression for the spherical albedo of a uniform , homogeneous atmosphere with a scattering albedo , @xmath223 ( @xmath224 ) , and a scattering asymmetry factor , @xmath133 :    @xmath225    where @xmath226 .",
    "though this formula ca nt handle stratification , it summarizes the basic influence of absorption and of scattering asymmetry on albedos . the appropriate integration over wavelength yields the corresponding bond albedo .",
    "direct photometric and spectroscopic detection of close - in egps is likely within the next few years .",
    "the sbp set of egp albedos serve as a useful guide to the prominent features and systematics over a full range of egp effective temperatures , for  from @xmath2100 k to 1700 k. however , full radiative / convective and evolutionary modeling of a given egp at a specific orbital distance from its central star ( of given spectral type ) , and of specific mass , age , and composition is necessary for a detailed understanding of a particular object .",
    "furthermore , tidal effects will enforce corotation for nearby planets and this will require an understanding of the mechanical ( wind ) transport of heat to the planet s night side in order to determine the energy budget and temperature profile of the close - in planet s atmosphere ( showman and guillot 2000 ) .",
    "however , in the spirit of preliminary approximation , figure [ refspect ] depicts reflection spectra of some representative egps from classes ii through v. the strength of the various water and methane features depends upon the presence of clouds and the cloud model assumed .",
    "hence , fig .",
    "[ refspect ] should be viewed as no more than a guide to the gross systematics of egp reflection spectra .",
    "nevertheless , the significant variety of egp reflection spectra is evident and will be diagnostically useful .",
    "the precisely known values of the age , mass , radius , intrinsic luminosity , and chemical composition of the hydrogen - rich giant planets , jupiter and saturn , allow us to calibrate our theoretical calculations of the structure and evolution of egps and smos .",
    "in contrast , the lower - mass ice giant planets , uranus and neptune , ( masses @xmath20.05 ) plot slightly above the radius versus mass curve for pure h@xmath51o on fig . [ guil.rock ] and",
    "are thus inferred to contain mostly h@xmath51o and other hydrides of c , n , and o , with a superficial layer of h@xmath51 and he ( hubbard , podolak , and stevenson 1995 ) .",
    "uranus and neptune are thus so different from the hydrogen - rich bodies that they are not currently useful as `` calibrators '' ( although this situation may change when even lower mass egps are detected ) .",
    "in contrast , much of the same physics which governs the evolution of egps and smos is also applicable to jupiter and saturn .",
    "this point is made in fig .",
    "[ tpbill ] , which shows interior pressure - temperature profiles for jupiter and the brown dwarf gl 229b at various ages , superimposed on a phase diagram for dense hydrogen .",
    "phase boundaries for pure hydrogen are shown in green , with dashed portions representing particularly uncertain boundaries . at pressures below about 1 mbar ( @xmath2one million atmospheres )",
    ", hydrogen is in the form of a nearly - isentropic supercritical liquid which merges seamlessly with the atmosphere .",
    "the nature of the transition from liquid molecular to liquid metallic hydrogen ( terminating at critical point `` scvh '' ) is based on the theory of saumon , chabrier , and van horn ( 1995 ) , although experimental data in the vicinity of the curve ( collins 1995 ) show no evidence of a discontinuity .",
    "the areas shaded in yellow and light blue pertain to a solar mixture of h and he , and indicate the region in p - t space where such a mixture is theoretically predicted to separate into two liquid phases , one he - rich and the other he - poor .",
    "the yellow region shows the region of such immiscibility predicted by stevenson and salpeter ( 1977 ) , while the blue region marked with the letter `` p. '' represents a prediction for the same phenomenon , calculated by pfaffenzeller , hohl , and ballone ( 1995 ) .",
    "the red dotted curves show the interior isentrope for the representative brown dwarf at an early age ( 7 myr ) and at an advanced age of 2 gyr , nominally the present gl 229b .",
    "the red dash - dot curve shows the evolutionary trajectory of its central pressure and temperature , illustrating the phenomenon of the achievement of a maximum temperature and its subsequent decline owing to the onset of electron degeneracy ( fig .",
    "[ tc.ps ] ) .",
    "since the maximum central temperature exceeds the threshold for deuterium fusion ( shown in black ) , the brown dwarf gl 229b should be depleted in deuterium .",
    "a similar set of curves ( in blue ) is shown for the evolution of jupiter .",
    "the principal points that fig .",
    "[ tpbill ] makes are : ( a ) the present p - t profile of gl 229b is nearly coincident with that of the early jupiter ( age @xmath20.1 gyr ) , and , thus , this object s envelope structure reprises that of the early jupiter , ( b ) both jupiter and gl 229b could potentially be affected by a first - order phase transition between h@xmath51 and metallic h ( at least , if the scvh theory is correct ) , and ( c ) in the late ( current ) stages of evolution of jupiter possible h - he immiscibility could affect the structure and luminosity of the object ( if the stevenson - salpeter theory is correct , but not if the pfaffenzeller theory is correct ) .",
    "while jupiter and saturn provide useful test cases for models of egps , complications exist .",
    "first , neither jupiter nor saturn are of precisely solar composition .",
    "a careful study of jupiter s composition by guillot , gautier , and hubbard ( 1997 ) finds that the metallicity ( z - component ) of the latter is between one and seven times solar .",
    "while there is evidence for a dense core in jupiter , it is apparently not a large one and most of the z - component is distributed throughout the planet .",
    "evidently , the formation of jupiter was an inefficient process , leading to a modest enhancement of the more refractory ( and denser ) compounds relative to the most volatile ones ( principally h and he ) .",
    "this is a hallmark of a planetary , as opposed to a `` stellar , '' mode of formation .",
    "saturn s bulk composition is even more strongly non - solar and there is clear evidence in the gravity field for a sizeable core , comprising perhaps 20% of the total planetary mass ( hubbard and stevenson 1984 ) .",
    "although there is some evidence for he depletion in the atmosphere , the depletion with respect to solar composition is less extreme than initially reported , and could even be zero ( conrath and gautier 2000 ) , consistent with the pfaffenzeller phase diagram .",
    "nevertheless , there is a long - standing discrepancy between the observed luminosity of saturn and the prediction based on a straightforward application of the cooling theory for egps : saturn s present luminosity is too large , compared with the predicted value .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pfaff ] , which is taken from hubbard ( 1999 ) .",
    "the curves marked with crosses are the calculated cooling curves for isolated planets of jupiter s and saturn s mass , essentially from the egp theory .",
    "the curves marked with solid and open circles are cooling curves calculated with allowance for atmospheric heating from solar luminosity , assuming variable and constant solar luminosity , respectively .",
    "all of the smooth curves are extrapolated to the present epoch ( dashed lines ) assuming homogeneous interior composition , while the abrupt change in slope near the present shows the effect of interior differentiation into dense and less - dense components under various assumptions .",
    "the horizontal error bars show alternative extensions of the cooling age for assumed differentiation",
    ". clearly differentiation , which is not included in the standard egp theory , is needed to explain saturn s evolution . in view of the questions about whether this is consistent with the h - he phase diagram , perhaps some other abundant dense component is presently differentiating in saturn .",
    "if true , this may be one means by which to distinguish the origin , `` planetary '' or `` stellar , '' of an old , sub - jovian mass smo .",
    "however , it is reassuring that the egp theory works well for the more massive ( and slightly hotter ) jupiter .",
    "a major theme of this review is that , from the theoretical perspective , however different their modes of formation , egps and brown dwarfs are essentially the same .",
    "whatever their masses and metallicities , and whether or not one class nucleates at formation around an ice / rock core , each subclass of hydrogen - rich object can be treated with the same basic theoretical tools . as such , in a very useful sense , the chemistry , spectra , atmospheric physics , opacities , equation of state , and nuclear physics that we explored in this paper apply universally across the smo continuum , even to egps in close proximity to their central stars .",
    "such universality is at the very heart of figs .",
    "[ lum.ps ] and [ teff ] .",
    "the resulting science is a fruitful merger of planetary and classical astronomy ( drawing from the perspectives of each ) that is more than the sum of its parts .",
    "we have attempted here to summarize a still emerging theory for objects below the main sequence edge that encompasses three orders of magnitude in both mass and age and a factor of @xmath230 in . though there has been incredible progress in smo studies since our earlier review ( burrows and liebert 1993 ) , much concerning their spectra , compositions , band and line strengths , cloud properties , statistics , and atmospheric physics remains to be determined , understood , and explained .",
    "fortunately , as with any healthy science , the theory is now being driven by an avalanche of new measurements and observations .",
    "the prospects for additional discoveries of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs , and their ever - more detailed characterization , are excellent",
    ". for egps , continued radial velocity discoveries in the inner few a.u . around nearby stars",
    "will be extended with more sensitive surveys around m dwarfs . in perhaps 1% of systems",
    ", we can expect observations of transits of egps across their parent stars , as well as ( for many more systems ) astrometric detections from the ground ( with the keck , vlt , and large binocular telescope ( lbt ) interferometers ) and from space ( with fame and sim ) .",
    "several spaceborne efforts to detect the transits of planets as small as earth ( with corot , most , mons ) or to directly detect egp emissions / reflections ( for instance , with the lbt , ngss , eclipse , eddington ) are proposed , planned , or imminent . likewise , microlensing projects to survey larger volumes of space for brown dwarfs , egps , and even earths are underway on the ground and planned for space .",
    "ultimately , large spaceborne interferometers such as that conceived for the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) mission , will not only image planetary systems , but will also provide moderate - resolution spectra of giant and terrestral planets orbiting nearby stars .",
    "importantly , the photometric bandpasses of the irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 ) and the mips ( @xmath21920 ) cameras on sirtf ( the space infrared telescope facility ) include those optimal for detection of brown dwarfs cooler than can be found by the current 2mass , sdss and denis surveys from the ground .",
    "figure [ 15mj-30 ] depicts theoretical spectra from 1.0 to 30 of a 15 brown dwarf at various epochs . superposed",
    "are approximate sensitivities of sirtf , ngst , tpf , and keck .",
    "particularly around 5 , but also longward of 10 , theory predicts that cool brown dwarfs will be a major activity of space - borne telescopes in the next decade .",
    "hence , while these telescopes will be able to survey only a modest area of the sky , they will be excellent for detecting brown dwarfs in the mid - infrared , for targeting known field l and t dwarfs for companions of lower mass , and for discovering field `` water cloud '' dwarfs (  [ spectra ] and  [ albedo ] ) with below those of the t dwarfs .    given the increasing area of mirror glass that is being coupled to sensitive detectors , optical and infrared spectra of l and t dwarfs , as well as of a handful of cooler giant planets , will be routinely obtained from the ground .",
    "moderate class telescopes ( 2- to 4-meter diameter ) , run by consortia of universities , are likely to proliferate and these facilities are excellent for completing l - dwarf , t - dwarf , and water - cloud - dwarf surveys in the solar neighborhood . as the oversubscribed 10-meter kecks",
    "are joined by the 6.5-meter mmt and magellan telescopes ( now being commissioned ) , the 8-meter subaru , the twin-8.4 meter lbt , the 8-meter geminis , the 9-meter hobby - eberly telescope , and the european vlt ( four 8-meter mirrors ) ( among others ) , deeper searches , and higher resolution spectra , of nearby t dwarfs will become possible and routine .",
    "ultimately , in order to spectroscopically investigate l and t dwarfs to the level that is now possible for jupiter in our own solar system will require a new generation of telescopes with apertures of 30 meters or more ; unbelievably , these are now in the planning stages .",
    "the study of brown dwarfs and egps is very much germane to understanding the occurrence and properties of planetary systems , the baryonic content and chemical evolution of the cosmos , and the relationship ( in both genesis and physical properties ) between stars and objects not massive enough to ever become stars . by detecting and characterizing brown dwarfs and egps ,",
    "we extend our knowledge of the cosmos from the ubiquitous macroscale of stars ever closer to the instinctively appealing , and human , scale of worlds like our own .",

    "<S> straddling the traditional realms of the planets and the stars , objects below the edge of the main sequence have such unique properties , and are being discovered in such quantities , that one can rightly claim that a new field at the interface of planetary science and astronomy is being born . in this review , we explore the essential elements of the theory of brown dwarfs and giant planets , as well as of the new spectroscopic classes l and t. to this end , we describe their evolution , spectra , atmospheric compositions , chemistry , physics , and nuclear phases and explain the basic systematics of substellar - mass objects across three orders of magnitude in both mass and age and a factor of 30 in effective temperature . moreover , we discuss the distinctive features of those extrasolar giant planets that are irradiated by a central primary , in particular their reflection spectra , albedos , and transits . </S>",
    "<S> aspects of the latest theory of jupiter and saturn are also presented . throughout , we highlight the effects of condensates , clouds , molecular abundances , and molecular / atomic opacities in brown dwarf and giant planet atmospheres and summarize the resulting spectral diagnostics . where possible , the theory is put in its current observational context .    </S>",
