    "for more than four decades the largest science yield of variable and transient radio emission has come from single - dish radio telescopes , which have surveyed the sky for pulsed and periodic emission from pulsars and related phenomena on typical timescales of seconds to milliseconds .",
    "in contrast , interferometric imaging surveys , which are best - suited to probe timescales ranging from seconds , hours and days , have only just begun .",
    "there are a limited number of surveys of these so - called _ long duration _",
    "transients and variables at frequencies of 110 ghz , each with a different sensitivity , cadence and field - of - view @xcite . fully exploring this phase space",
    "is one of the main science drivers for a new generation of synoptic radio imaging facilities , such as askap @xcite and apertif / wsrt @xcite , that are being built in the coming years ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "our knowledge of the variable ghz sky is especially lacking at sub - millijansky flux density levels . for _ persistent _ sources",
    "there is a well - known flattening of the euclidean - normalized radio source counts below about 1 mjy , corresponding to a change in the radio source populations .",
    "this flattening is likely due to the emerging importance of star forming galaxies and low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at redshifts of order unity @xcite .",
    "thus , while the variability studies above millijansky levels are dominated by radio - loud agns with compact , flat - spectrum components @xcite , variability at these deeper flux density levels may probe new source populations .",
    "there are indications that the mjy transient sky is exciting . over the last decade",
    "astronomers have detected transient decimetric emission from a variety of sources : transient , bursting and pulsed radio emission from magnetars @xcite , short - lived radio afterglows of short - duration gamma - ray bursts @xcite , emission from ( a transient ) jet in a dwarf nova @xcite , a new population of sub - relativistic supernovae @xcite , a mysterious population of bursting radio sources @xcite , and relativistic outflows from tidal disruption events @xcite .",
    "however , with few exceptions , most of what we know about the transient radio sky has come via radio follow - up of objects identified by synoptic telescopes at optical , x - ray or gamma - ray wavelengths .",
    "clearly , this titillating trove of ( serendipitous ) discoveries call for systematic exploration of the decimetric sky on timescales of minutes and longer",
    ".    a ready source of archival data for searching for sub - millijansky transients and variables comes from deep continuum imaging surveys of the ghz radio sky undertaken to study the extragalactic radio source populations .",
    "many such surveys have been carried out , reaching noise levels of 410 @xmath0jy and with arcsecond resolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to reach these deep flux density limits , it is standard to observe these fields for many epochs with a cadence that samples timescales of days , weeks and months .",
    "an added benefit is that these deep surveys are accompanied by rich multi - wavelength continuum datasets and optical / infrared spectroscopic measurements .",
    "thus the counterpart of any unusual variable or transient source can be readily identified and its redshift determined .    in this paper",

    "all the observations were carried out in 2007 between june 15 and september 23 . only a single pointing was observed for each epoch .",

    "@xcite identified sources using the _ aips _ task sad down to 4@xmath1 , and then inspected the residual map to identify missed sources as well as accepted sources which were poorly fit by sad .",
    "these missing sources were then added to the preliminary source list .",
    "further flagging and follow - up was done in order to produce a modified source list in which all sources with peak flux density greater than 5 times the local rms noise ( i.e. 5@xmath1 ) , were fit using the _ aips _ task jmfit .",
    "also , the effect of bandwidth smearing on sources within the six individual pointings was assessed using jmfit , and the resolution information was thus preserved in the output catalog .",
    "lastly , the sources in the dr2 catalog were compared with the catalog of @xcite .",
    "the dr2 catalog contains almost twice as many sources ( 883 vs. 464 ) compared to the first data release ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) owing to a more careful data reduction .",
    "of the 883 sources in the dr2 catalog we created a point - source - only catalog of 736 objects used for exploring variability . with this careful approach outlined above , we expect the @xcite dr2 catalog to contain all real sources above 5@xmath1 ( however , see  [ sec : algorithms ] ) .",
    "we thus justify our use of the dr2 catalog for investigating the variability of the sub - millijansky population . in  [",
    "sec : method ] we use both the dr2 image and its source catalog as a testbed for different source - finding algorithms .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of sources in the dr2 catalog is shown in figure  [ fig : dr2_snr ] .",
    "it is important to quantify the uncertainty in the peak flux density when analyzing variability of sources in different epochs .",
    "following @xcite , we attribute this uncertainty primarily to a combination of four causes : ( i ) local image rms noise , ( ii ) uncertainty in the primary beam , ( iii ) flux density calibration amplitude , ( iv ) pointing errors .",
    "let us denote the measured peak flux density of a source in epoch @xmath18 by @xmath19 , such that the primary beam correction is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angular distance of the source from the phase center .",
    "we wish to calculate the uncertainty in the quantity @xmath22 .",
    "the image local noise ( @xmath23 ) scales as @xmath24 . if we denote the fractional uncertainty in the beam as @xmath25 and that in the flux density calibration amplitude by @xmath26 , then the corresponding errors scales as @xmath27 .",
    "we adopt a value of 4% for @xmath26 , intermediate between the conservative estimate of @xcite , 5% , and the one quoted by @xcite , 3% . the typical pointing error ( @xmath28 ) of a vla antenna",
    "is between 1020 .",
    "the resultant uncertainty scales as @xmath29 .",
    "all these four error terms , added in quadrature , would give the total uncertainty , @xmath30 , in the peak flux density corrected for the primary beam attenuation .",
    "however , as shown below , the pointing - related error term is much smaller than the rest , and hence can be neglected .",
    "thus ,    @xmath31    polynomial coefficients ( and the associated error ) that express the average angular dependence of @xmath32 can be found in the aips task ` pbcor ` , while measurements of the vla beam power response to beyond the first null are given in @xcite .",
    "using the beam response profile from @xcite , we can estimate the error terms ( i)(iv ) above for a typical source in the dr2 catalog , having measured flux density of @xmath33jy .",
    "if the source lies at the half - power radius ( @xmath34 ) , then these correction factors are about 10% , 4% , 4% and 1% of the primary - beam - corrected flux density ( @xmath35jy ) respectively .",
    "the pointing - related uncertainty is thus negligible . in light of @xcite",
    ", we use two measures of variability ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the modulation index defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean ,    @xmath36    and the @xmath37 , @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the number of epochs , and @xmath40 is the mean flux density of the source over all the epochs considered for the variability analysis . in these two equations ,",
    "the primary beam correction is implicit in @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath42 gives a measure of the deviation from stochastic epoch - to - epoch fluctuations in the peak flux density , and we define `` significant variability '' beyond a level corresponds to a probability of about 1/16,000 , while the number of measurements in our variability analysis ( several to tens of epochs multiplied by a few hundred sources ) ranges from about 1,500 to 15,000 . ] of 4@xmath1 .",
    "the modulation index indicates the strength of variability , i.e. the fractional variation of the peak flux density .",
    "a variability analysis was carried out on each pointing in table [ tab : listoffields ] separately .",
    "peak flux densities were measured for all point sources in the dr2 catalog brighter than 40 @xmath0jy and within a 15@xmath43 radius of the pointing centers ( i.e. the 50% response radius of the primary beam of the vla antennas ; see also figure  [ fig : obscoverage ] ) .",
    "this approach has the merit of being simple and robust .",
    "since the angular distance of a source from its pointing center is constant , the accuracy of the correction for the primary beam attenuation @xmath44 is unimportant .",
    "the modulation index and @xmath37 measures of variability are insensitive to a constant @xmath44 .",
    "the limitation of this approach is that the resulting light curves are constructed for only 79 epochs .",
    "many of our investigated point sources are found in multiple pointings and therefore light curves can be constructed with many more epochs , resulting in higher cadence over the full 100 days of observing .",
    "a full variability analysis of this kind is carried out in  [ sec : full ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : chi2vsm_singlepontings ] we show variability plots ( i.e. @xmath37 vs. @xmath45 ) for the dr2 sources in each of the six pointings .",
    "there are approximately 175 sources per pointing .",
    "some of the bright ( @xmath46 mjy ) sources show significant variability but with only low modulation indices ( @xmath4710% ) .",
    "we define strong variables as sources having @xmath48 ( i.e. higher than 50% fractional variability ) .",
    "only two genuine variables were found in this single - pointing analysis ; no strong variables were found ( table  [ tab : variables ] , upper panel ) .          in order to undertake variability analysis using data from all the epochs",
    ", the single - epoch peak flux densities were required to be corrected for ( i ) bandwidth - smearing , and ( ii ) the primary beam response , as any given source will lie at different angular distance from the phase center in different pointings .",
    "we applied bandwidth smearing correction from the approximation given in @xcite ( eqn .",
    "13 - 19 therein ) .",
    "there were two choices for the primary beam profile  one derived as the empirical beam profile for vla - first @xcite , and the other found in the aips task ` pbcor ` . to test which of these profiles best represented our data , we adopted the following approach .",
    "we first normalized the peak flux densities of @xmath49jy sources from all epochs using their peak flux density from the dr2 catalog and plotted them as a function of distance from the pointing center . the resultant beam profile matched with the vla - first profile better than the one from pbcor ( to within 1% , but only for @xmath50 ; scatter of 6.5% ) .",
    "hence we used the former beam profile for our primary beam correction , @xmath44 ; the associated error ( @xmath25 ) , was also taken from @xcite .",
    "thus , for a reliable all - epoch variability analysis , we restricted our search to the point sources in the dr2 catalog which were located within @xmath51 from the pointing centers of their respective epochs .",
    "this also appears to be the radius beyond which our bandwidth- smearing approximation starts to break down .",
    "thus , for example , a source located at @xmath52 and @xmath53 would be present in pointings 6 , 5 , and 1 , but not in 2,3 , and 4 because the separation between the source and the centers of pointings 2,3 , and 4 is larger than 12 arcmin .",
    "further , as we did with the single - pointing variability (  [ sec : single ] ) , we restricted our analysis to sources whose mean flux density was brighter than 40 @xmath0jy .",
    "this full variability analysis was carried out on 599 point sources .",
    "depending on the number of pointings in which a source is present , this analysis allowed us to exploit the higher cadence over the entire duration of the observing program .",
    "the resulting light curves are now more densely sampled with 1526 epochs , rather than the 79 epochs for the single - pointing variability case . in figure",
    "[ fig : chi2.imval_allepoch ] we show variability plots for the dr2 sources , taking into account all the epochs .",

    "for all the tests carried out on sfind , miriad version 4.2.3 ( optimized for carma ; cvs revision 1.11 , 2011/04/26 ) was used .    here , we explore the completeness and reliability of sfind by tweaking the two relevant parameters : ( i ) @xmath157 , the percentage of probable background pixels that can be accepted in the analysis , and ( ii ) @xmath158 , the size of the smoothing box used for estimating the background and the standard deviation of the image .",
    "table  [ tab : sfind_completeness ] lists the parameter values tested . in general , completeness of sfind increases , and its reliability decreases ( table  [ tab : sfind_completeness ] ) with increasing @xmath101 , as expected for an fdr algorithm .",
    "also , both these quantities increase with @xmath158 .",
    "the rise in completeness and reliability is precipitous ( between 5% and 20% ) as @xmath158 is increased from 5 to 10 beamwidths , after which it flattens off .",
    "there is a slight decrease in the reliability as @xmath158 is increased from 20 to 50 beamwidths .",
    "10 beamwidths can then be interpreted as the minimum box size for determining the background rms noise without significant contribution from the sources themselves , whereas 50 beamwidths would correspond to the size where the calculated rms starts deviating significantly from the true local rms . however , in the case of bright sources in the field , these @xmath158 limits might be somewhat larger .",
    "completeness and reliability are @xmath4788% for @xmath101=10 and @xmath158=20 , but better reliability ( by a few percent ) can be obtained at an equal expense of completeness by using @xmath101=5 or 2 .",
    "further decrease in @xmath101 substantially decreases the completeness without any significant improvement in the reliability .",
    "thus , we determine the optimum values for the input parameters to be @xmath159 and @xmath160 beamwidths . for the fdr algorithm , we expect the reliability to be @xmath161 . however , sfind reliability is lesser than this expected value by a few percent , due to the acceptance of sidelobes of bright sources and fitting of extended sources with multiple elongated and overlapping ( unphysical ) components .",
    "to some extent , the acceptance of these false sources can be reduced by choosing a lower value of @xmath101 .",
    "some examples of the components fit by sfind to different kinds of sources in different environments in the dr2 image are shown in figure  [ fig : cutouts ] .",

    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : reliability_algorithms ] shows the reliability .",
    "curiously , there is a dip in the reliability between snrs of 6 and 10 .",
    "point sources strewn across the dr2 image but primarily located near its edges ( in regions of increased rms ; see the lower panel of figure  [ fig : source_cutouts ] for example ) , which are absent in the dr2 catalog and detected by sfind , are responsible for this reduced reliability .",
    "some of these sources get rejected from the sfind catalog when a lower value of @xmath101 or @xmath158 is used , indicating that they are either not genuine sources on the sky or are sources at a lower snr .",
    "indeed , other algorithms find some of these sources to be at a much reduced snr between 3 and 5 .",
    "the results of @xcite also show a dip in the sfind reliability , although centered on snr@xmath4715 .",
    "figure  [ fig : snr_offset_algorithms ] compares the snr of sources detected by sfind , with those of the counterparts from the dr2 catalog .",
    "the largely increased snr reported for sources at or below 6@xmath1 in the dr2 catalog , and largely reduced snr for sources above @xmath47100@xmath1 , is anomalous .",
    "although for snr above 100 the discrepancy is likely to be due to overlapping components fit to extended sources , all the above observations indicate that the snr reported by sfind is somewhat different from that reported by other algorithms .",
    "sources with 6@xmath162snr@xmath16210 in the sfind catalog clearly have over - estimatated ( upto 100% ) peak flux densities and different dimensions than what would be expected by inspecting the cutouts of these sources .",
    "thus , fitting of sources rather than differently - reported rms is the cause of the snr descrepancy , at least at these low snrs .",
    "the solution of this issue is possibly in correctly setting the _ fdrpeak _ and _ psfsize _ input parameters which allow reasonable measurements of sources close to the threshold .",
    "since there are not many sources in our data having snr @xmath16370 ( figure  [ fig : dr2_snr ] ) , the suggested trend in completeness , reliability and measured snr in this domain should be treated with caution .",
    "_ sextractor _ is a source - finding program widely used in optical astronomy , and is particularly oriented towards the reduction of large - scale galaxy - survey data , as well as sparsely- to moderately - crowded stellar fields .",
    "it analyzes the image in two passes such that , in the first pass , a background map is made , and in the second , background - subtraction , filtering and thresholding is done on - the - fly .",
    "detected sources are then deblended and cleaned before performing photometry . the run - time for _ sextractor _",
    "searching for sources down to 5@xmath1 in the dr2 image is about 2 seconds .",
    "for all the tests carried out here , the latest release of _ sextractor _ ( version 2.8.6 , 09-apr-2009 ) has been used .",
    "we adopted a strategy of searching for sources down to n@xmath1 ( n=3,5,6,7,10 , as set using the @xmath164 parameter in _ sextractor _ ) and then selecting the ones @xmath935@xmath1 prior to the comparison with the dr2 sources .",
    "two input parameters ( apart from possibly @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , which we have not tested ) are expected to affect the completeness and reliability of the _ sextractor _ catalog",
    ". first , the mesh - size , which determines the size of the box used for background rms estimation , is specified by @xmath168 , and second , the size of the median filter ( @xmath169 ) applied to the background grid used for smoothing large artifacts in the image .    in table  [ tab : sextractor_completeness ] , we list the completeness and reliability as a function of these parameters .",
    "note that in this table , in order to reflect the true completeness for the specified detection threshold , the completeness values of the _ sextractor _ catalog for 6@xmath1 , 7@xmath1 and 10@xmath1 thresholds have been normalized by the percentage of sources in the dr2 catalog which are beyond these thresholds respectively .",
    "thus , the completeness at any threshold is expected to be 100% if all the dr2 sources beyond that threshold are detected by _",
    "sextractor_. the general trend observed is that , with increasing detection threshold , the completeness of _ sextractor _ is fairly steady , but its reliability increases .",
    "however , for 5@xmath1 and 6@xmath1 detection thresholds , the completeness is rather low ( @xmath4775% or lower ) .",
    "choosing higher detection thresholds such as 710@xmath1 does not seem to improve the completeness substantially .",
    "this is due several factors through which the source - finding in _ sextractor _ seems to be different from the conventionally - used algorithms in radio astronomy .",
    "firstly , for any given source , the reported peak flux density decreases as the detection threshold is raised , although there is not much of a change in the reported rms .",
    "hence , the snr of sources close to the detection threshold decreases so as to be rejected by _",
    "sextractor_. choosing a 3@xmath1 threshold usually gives the correct peak flux density .",
    "this is also the reason why searching down to 3@xmath1 and selecting sources at the desired , higher threshold , increases the completeness ( although with the side effect of reduced reliability ) .",
    "the explanation for such an effect is hinted by the fact that the dimensions of the fitted sources decrease ( this effect is quite significant for sources with snr@xmath16210 ) with increasing detection threshold , implying that the number of source pixels considered in the fitting process depends on the threshold .",
    "secondly , several dr2 sources having snr@xmath16210 and detected by other source - finding algorithms ( excepting imsad ) , are not detected at all by _",
    ", not even at a reduced snr . this might be due the differences in the fitting process rather than discrepant rms .",

    "the reason for the low completeness at a detection threshold of 5@xmath1 is that several dr2 sources ( which are detected by sfind , sad and _ aegean _ ) close to this threshold are not detected by imsad , not even at a reduced snr .",
    "the reliability at this threshold is also rather low .",
    "this can be attributed to several false point sources detected near the edges of the dr2 image , which are mainly low - snr features mistaken to be high - snr due to incorrect assumption of the local rms . since imsad",
    "does not give the rms for each detected source , one needs to assume this quantity ( a constant equal to @xmath187jy in our case ) , and thus , the snr calculated in regions of increased rms , e.g. regions close to the edge of the dr2 image , is expected to be erroneous . by using an rms image to find the local rms , this false - detection problem can be tackled .",

    "imsad shows reduced reliability between snrs of 10 and 20 , beyond which the reliability roughly flattens off at the 95% level .",

    "these false sources can easily be rejected by using a peak - to - integrated flux density ratio criterion .",
    "second , imsad does not break up islands into components as mentioned above , resulting in extended source positions to be substantially different from those listed in the dr2 catalog .",
    "this was also found in the tests carried out by @xcite , which resulted in several false detections .",
    "figure  [ fig : snr_offset_algorithms ] shows the snr of imsad sources compared with their counterparts in the dr2 catalog .",

    "the peak flux densities agree quite well between the aegean and dr2 catalogs , but the rms reported by aegean is consistently higher , which causes the disagreement at the high - snr end of the diagram .",
    "we find remarkable differences between algorithms in terms of components fitted for extended sources , sidelobe rejection , and point sources detected in regions where the rms is appreciably larger than the mean rms .",
    "our results for completeness and reliability are broadly similar to those of @xcite and @xcite . for applications that need both completeness as well as reliability , sfind and _ aegean _ are good .",

    "the source is not found in the reference catalog ( within 2 ) of persistent sources .",
    "the reference catalog was constructed similar to dr2 but the sources were selected up to the 20% power point of the beam ( i.e. @xmath198 radius ) of each pointing rather than the 34@xmath43 interior region shown in figure  [ fig : obscoverage ] .",

    "the large number of synthesized beams searched ( @xmath210 ) in this dataset , there is a modest probability that a transient candidate is due to noise .",
    "we thus carried out an analysis similar to @xcite ( see appendix a of that paper ) to determine the snr above which the probability of having the highest value of @xmath211 gaussian random numbers is @xmath1751% .",
    "this corresponds to an snr of 6.1 .",
    "however , following the recommendation of @xcite to have a higher snr cutoff when the noise was not strictly gaussian , we chose @xmath199 as the lower limit for finding transients .    the search method outlined above",
    "may miss transients which are bright enough to be present in the reference catalog .",
    "therefore , we also searched ( with similar constraints as above ) for sources which are detected in the reference catalog of persistent sources and detected in only one of the single - epoch catalogs .    for sfind",
    ", we adopted the parameters @xmath101=10 and @xmath158=20 for transient search .",
    "we found five candidates which are present only in a single epoch above the @xmath199 detection threshold .",
    "they also show up in the reference catalog .",
    "however , all of these candidates seem to be variable but persistent , and are detected at a low snr ( @xmath4735@xmath1 ) in other epochs .",
    "thus we do not find any transient with sfind .    for _ aegean _ , we used a clipping level of @xmath199 and a curvature - map cutoff of @xmath212 .",
    "we discarded all the transients corresponding to islands which were too small to give a 6-parameter gaussian fit ( sources with flag 10000 or 00100 set ) since otherwise we were dealing with a large number of transients . using these constraints",

    "we do not find any transients with sad .    with imsad , we searched for sources down to @xmath199 with the histogram option set .",

    "in this paper we have explored the time - domain properties of a 1.4 ghz survey made toward the extended chandra deep field south ( e - cdfs ) region .",
    "six mosaic pointings toward e - cdfs were taken in 49 separate epochs over a period of three months .",
    "single - epoch images allow us to explore the transient and variable radio sky at sub - millijansky levels on timescales of days , weeks and months .",
    "we will now use these data to assess the degree of variability (  [ sec : vary ] ) and the transient rate (  [ sec : rate ] ) of the radio sky , and predict what will be seen by future wide - field surveys (  [ sec : future ] ) .",
    "we found in our study that only a small fraction ( @xmath214 ) of the point sources in the e - cdfs showed any significant variability on day - week - month timescales . evidently , the sub - millijansky radio sky at 1.4 ghz is not highly variable .",
    "the only previous sub - mjy study at 1.4 ghz was from a single deep pointing toward the lockman hole . with sampling timescales of 19 days , @xcite found less than 2% of sources above 0.1 mjy to be highly variable .",

    "@xcite analyzed 22 years and 2775 deg@xmath215 of most observations at 0.84 ghz and found only 0.17% ( 53/29730 ) strong variables above 14 mjy on timescales of days to minutes to years .",
    "finally , @xcite used the allen telescope array to survey a 690 deg@xmath215 area at 1.4 ghz .",
    "they compared their catalog to the nvss , finding that 0.1% ( 6/4408 ) of the sources were highly variable on a timescale of 15 years .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lognlogs ] we plot the differential source counts for the persistent radio sky at 1.4 ghz , normalized in the usual way by the euclidean rate @xcite .",
    "the steep evolution of the agn with decreasing flux density is apparent , as is the flattening of the source counts near 1 mjy .",
    "the fractional variability appears to be low , at a level of one percent , among the sources greater than 100 @xmath0jy .        comparing the variability properties at 1.4 ghz of our sub - mjy population with those at higher flux densities",
    ", we find no obvious change in the _ fraction _ of strong variables .",
    "this is despite the fact that radio - loud agn ( which dominate at millijansky levels ) diminish in importance as radio - quiet agn and star forming galaxies begin to populate the radio sky at lower flux densities , the latter constituting about 50% of the sub - millijansky radio sky @xcite . on the other hand , in a sample of brightness temperature - limited radio sources",
    ", it would be expected that the variability would increase with decreasing flux density .",
    "our optical identifications for the seven radio variables show a mix of agn and star - forming galaxies .",
    "six of these are consistent with a nuclear source based on the carefully matched astrometry .",
    "there is no evidence from this sub - mjy sample that we are seeing a new source of variable radio emission such as supernovae , gamma - ray bursts , etc .",
    "that would be expected to be offset from the nucleus .",
    "radio variability appears to be a strong function of frequency .",
    "the best study to compare to this one is the 5 ghz survey of @xcite , since it used a similar observing cadence and the identical statistical measures of variability . in this case",
    "it was found that @xmath4730% of point sources brighter than 1.5 mjy at 5 ghz were variable .",
    "some caution is warranted in comparing fractional variability between different experiments .",
    "differences in the cadence , integration time , duration , and angular resolution will have a tendency of reducing the variability amplitude .",
    "for example , the low angular resolution of some surveys may have the effect of reducing the strong variability from compact radio sources embedded in diffuse emission .",
    "this current survey with a synthesized beam of 2.8@xmath13 has the highest angular resolution of any previous variability survey ( see * ? ? ?",
    "another factor to consider is that the degree of variability which can be detected in a given experiment , as measured by the modulation index @xmath45 , is a function of the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a source in our present survey would have to have a mean flux density of 1 mjy in order to detect a 10% modulation , while at the 5@xmath1 limit of the dr2 catalog ( @xmath4740 @xmath0jy ) a source would have to have @xmath216 in order to be identified as a significant variable .",
    "no strong variables ( i.e. @xmath48 ) were identified in our survey , but only the about 90 sources in the dr2 catalog are bright enough ( @xmath93126 @xmath0jy ) to have been identified as a strong variable . in either case the fraction of significant or strong variables is less than a few percent of the sample .",
    "the most robust conclusion that can be drawn is that the variable radio sky at 1.4 ghz appears to be relatively quiet with only a fraction of a percent of sources varying substantially over a wide range of flux densities and timescales .",
    "we searched our multi - epoch data for transients but found none .",
    "the search was conducted on each image out to a radius of 21.5@xmath3 from the pointing center .",
    "the single - epoch area out to that radius is 0.40 deg@xmath9 , or a total area of 20 deg@xmath9 for all 49 epochs .",
    "however , the sensitivity of the vla antennas is not uniform across this area .",
    "the primary beam response is well - described by a gaussian with a half - width to half - maximum of 15@xmath3 , falling to 20% response at our search radius of 21.5@xmath3 . at the pointing center",
    "the 7@xmath1 flux density limit was approximately 210 @xmath0jy for each epoch .    in order to calculate a limit on the areal density of any putative transient population we follow @xcite and parameterize the source number - count function as a power law of the form @xmath217 where @xmath57 is the peak flux density",
    ", @xmath218 is the sky surface density of sources brighter than @xmath57 , @xmath219 is the sky surface density of sources brighter than @xmath220 , and @xmath221 is the power law index of the source number - count function . we assume , for simplicity , a homogeneous source distribution in euclidean universe so @xmath222 .",
    "the one - sided 2-@xmath1 upper limit on the areal density is three events @xcite .",
    "therefore , using equation c5 in @xcite we find that the 2@xmath1 upper limit on areal density to a flux limit of 210@xmath0jy is 18.0deg@xmath2 per epoch .",
    "given that we have 49 epochs the 2@xmath1 upper limit on the areal density is @xmath223deg@xmath2 .",
    "we can further estimate an upper limit on the transient rate assuming a duration @xmath224 less than the shortest time between epochs of @xmath225 @xmath226 .",
    "our upper limit on the areal density of transient sources at sub - millijansky levels can be compared with the predictions based on previous surveys .",
    "the @xcite survey is a useful benchmark since their areal density dominates all known classes of transients . adopting their measured two epoch rate of @xmath227deg@xmath2 and assuming a euclidean source distribution ( i.e. @xmath222 ) we predict @xmath228deg@xmath2 at the flux density limit of our current survey .",
    "an alternative way to look at our results is to compare our null detection to the expected number of bower et al .",
    "transients expected in our dataset .",
    "we use the parameterization of @xcite for the predicted bower et al .",
    "transient rate as a function of flux density ,      where @xmath230 is the snapshot rate , and @xmath231 denotes the detection threshold of the observations at the pointing center ( i.e. 7@xmath232jy ) . integrating both sides of equation [ eq : transientrate ] over the azimuthal angle and in @xmath21 out to @xmath233 we get about 0.42 transients per epoch , if the @xcite transients are real .",
    "since we have 49 epochs , we expect to have about 21 bower et al .",
    "transients in our e - cdfs dataset .",
    "our search on the e - cdfs field suggests that the areal density of radio transients is an order of magnitude or more below the rate measured by @xcite ( i.e. @xmath1620.37 deg@xmath2 vs. 3.5deg@xmath2 ) .",
    "alternatively , we find a 2@xmath1 upper limit of @xmath1623 transients while the predicted number is @xmath4721 transients .",
    "our work therefore appears to support that of @xcite , which found from a re - analysis of the bower et al .",
    "data , that the transient rate was as much as an order of magnitude smaller than previously reported .",
    "this conclusion would be more robust if the spectral index of the putative transient population was better known .",
    "@xcite was able to use other surveys to constrain the spectra index @xmath234 ( where s@xmath102 ) .",
    "since the @xcite rates were derived based on observations made mostly at 5 ghz , our only data provide strong constraints for @xmath235",
    ". a population of optically thick @xmath236 sources with a rate similar to that of @xcite would be undetected in our 1.4 ghz e - cdfs fields .    many of the same variability surveys discussed in ",
    "[ sec : vary ] were also sensitive to transients .",
    "superposed on the radio source - count plot of figure  [ fig : lognlogs ] are the results of several of these transients surveys .",
    "light grey shaded areas represent the transient phase space covered by each of the surveys , white space represents open phase space for future narrow - deep or wide - shallow surveys . with few exceptions most of these transient surveys result in upper limits . also shown",
    "are the normalized areal density of several known and expected classes of long - duration radio transients , based on @xcite .",
    "the nominal rates for the putative @xcite sources are about two orders of magnitude above the tidal disruption or swj1644 + 57-like objects .",
    "@xcite define a transient as having either a single detection in the analyzed epochs , or the highest flux density 5 times greater than the next highest one ( detection / upper - limit ) .",
    "thus , @xcite and 2-epoch surveys like @xcite may identify a strong variable as a true transient , which will move the source - count of detected transients lower in figure  [ fig : lognlogs ] .",
    "there are several facilities built or under construction that will be capable of synoptic imaging at 1.4 ghz .",
    "all of these facilities have the exploration of the time domain as part of their core science programs . the australian square kilometer array pathfinder ( askap ) and the apertif instrument on the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) will be using focal plane array technology to instantaneously image an instantaneous field of view ( fov ) of 30 deg@xmath9 and 8 deg@xmath9 , respectively @xcite . south africa is building meerkat , an array of 64 13.5-m diameter dishes , with a fov of 1 deg@xmath9 at 1.4 ghz @xcite . finally , there is the newly refurbished karl g. jansky array ( vla ) has 27 25-m dishes with a fov of 0.25 deg@xmath9 at 1.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "we list the capabilities of each of these telescopes in table [ tab : experiments ] .",
    "survey speed ( ss ) , normalized here to the vla , is a useful figure of merit for inter - comparison of survey capabilities of long duration transients and is expressed as      where bw is the bandwidth , @xmath238 the fov , a@xmath239 is the total collecting areas times the aperture efficiency @xmath240 , and t@xmath241 is the antenna system temperature @xcite .",
    "the relative survey speeds are only approximate since some of the system parameters for meerkat and askap have not been confirmed with on - the - sky testing . likewise , we have assumed that radio frequency interference ( rfi ) limits the vla bandwidth to only 50% of its maximum bw .",
    "larger fractions are achievable in the more extended array configurations and with better rfi excision of the data . we have calculated the askap survey speed with both the 18 phased array feeds which are currently funded and with the full 36 as originally specified . despite these uncertainties , it is clear from table [ tab : experiments ] that to within factors of a few , these are all powerful wide - field imaging facilities .    to illustrate these survey capabilities and compare them to what we currently know about the transient and variable radio sky",
    ", we will use the example of a electromagnetic counterpart search for gravitational waves .",
    "for a good overview of the topic of em - gw searches , and the main issues , we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "long - duration radio emission has been predicted to originate from the merger of a neutron star binary from several sources including the merger shock @xcite , afterglow emission from the beamed outflow in the relativistic and non - relativistic phases @xcite , and from quasi - isotropic , mildly relativistic outflows ejected during the merger @xcite .",
    "all of these mechanisms depend on the amount of energy put into shocked material and the density of the ambient medium .",
    "predicted flux densities and timescales therefore vary over a wide range .",
    "we take as an example the detection of a signal with a peak flux density of 100 @xmath0jy .",
    "such a signal might be expected to occur for an ambient medium with a density of 0.1 @xmath242 on day timescales for a merger shock , or on year - long timescales for mildly relativistic ejecta .",
    "we note that if short duration gamma - ray bursts are the dominant population of neutron star mergers , then the predicted radio signal would be difficult to detect with the telescopes in table [ tab : experiments ] , given the the canonical energy and ambient density inferred for this population @xcite",
    ".    the median sky localization of a gravitational - wave source will be 60 deg@xmath9 with a three - element gw network , and 7 deg@xmath9 with a five- element gw network @xcite . with such large error boxes , the main challenge for the identification of",
    "a em - gw counterpart will be to distinguish it from the foreground of false positives .",
    "optical - only searches for em - gw counterparts are expected to be overwhelmed by false positives at the required depth of 22 - 23 mag and special strategies are required @xcite . however , as we have shown from this paper , the radio sky at 1.4 ghz is relatively quiet . integrating the differential source counts in figure  [ fig : lognlogs ] using the fit from @xcite",
    ", we estimate that the number of _ persistent _ radio sources above 100 @xmath0jy to be 910 deg@xmath2 . we have estimated that the fraction of strong variables , on a wide range of timescales , is likely to be one percent or less , or 9 strong variables per square degree .",
    "further , the radio variables that we have seen to date have all been nuclear sources (  [ sec : variablesnotes ] ) .",
    "such variable or transient sources could be easily rejected as em - gw counterparts since significant offsets are predicted from the host galaxy based on binary neutron - star population synthesis models and measurements from short - hard gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "lastly , the number of unrelated transients is also expected to be much less .",
    "our derived limit on the transient areal rate of @xmath223deg@xmath2 translates to a @xmath1621.1 deg@xmath2 at 100 @xmath0jy (  [ sec : rate ] ) for a euclidean distribution .",
    "the limit on the _ known _ transient populations is even smaller @xcite .",
    "we believe that the multi - wavelength approach which we have taken here should inform future searches . for the radio variables that we found in the e - cdfs",
    ", we were able to identify the source of the emission using optical images and spectra (  [ sec : variablesnotes ] ) .",
    "a similar strategy could be employed to identify false - positives for the small number of radio variables or transient sources identified in em - gw counterpart searches .",
    "whether this approach will ultimately lead to a robust em - gw counterpart detection is uncertain , but in terms of characterizing the variables , minimizing false - positives and getting an early sense on the nature of transients , we suggest that joint radio - optical searches will be fruitful for exploring the dynamic sky .    m. kunal wishes to thank rick perley , eric greisen , sanjay bhatnagar , andrea petric , margherita bonzini , bill cotton , and paul hancock for useful discussions .",
