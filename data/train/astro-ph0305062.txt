    "evidence for the presence of massive black holes in the centers of most galaxies ( e.g. gebhardt et al .",
    "@xcite ) , together with recent and anticipated advances in observing capabilities , have focused interest on the observational implications of star - mbh interactions such as tidal disruption ( frank & rees @xcite ; frank @xcite ; lightman & shapiro @xcite ; syer & ulmer @xcite ; magorrian & tremaine @xcite ) , tidal scattering ( alexander & livio @xcite ) , gravitational wave ( gw ) emission ( e.g. hils & bender @xcite ; sigurdsson & rees @xcite ; freitag @xcite , @xcite ) , interaction with a massive accretion disk surrounding the mbh ( ostriker @xcite ; syer , clarke & rees @xcite ; vilkoviskij & czerny @xcite ) , and tidal capture and tidal heating ( novikov , petchik & polnarev @xcite ; alexander & morris @xcite , am03 ) . much effort has been devoted to the study of tidal disruption , which plays an important role in the growth of low - mass mbhs ( murphy , cohn & durisen @xcite ; freitag & benz @xcite ) and can provide a signature for the existence of mbh in galactic nuclei by the emission of tidal flares .",
    "dynamical analyses indicate that most of the stars scattered into radial orbits originate at the mbh radius of influence , @xmath10 , where the enclosed stellar mass roughly equals the mbh mass @xmath11 and the scattering is roughly isotropic .",
    "event horizon crossing or tidal disruption is prompt ; the stars plunge toward the mbh with a cross - section that scales as @xmath12 ( hills @xcite ) and reach it in less than the initial orbital period , @xmath13 , irrespective of orbital periapse , as long as @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the star is destroyed in a short time , e.g. @xmath15 yr in the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "in contrast , the other processes listed above proceed gradually over an inspiral time @xmath16 , as a small fraction of the orbital energy is dissipated every peri - passage .",
    "the inspiral time typically rises steeply with the periapse . in order for the extracted orbital energy to heat the disk , tidally",
    "heat the star or power a high luminosity of gravity waves , the star has first to decay into a short period orbit .",
    "novikov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimate that tidal capture by a mbh occurs for orbits with @xmath17 .",
    "it then follows that stars are scattered into tidal capture orbits at a rate @xmath18 times faster than that for prompt tidal disruption orbits .",
    "the orbital energy the star has to lose to circularize far exceeds its own binding energy , so it is likely that it will ultimately be disrupted ( rees @xcite ; am03 ) .",
    "this has led several authors ( frank & rees @xcite ; novikov et al .",
    "@xcite ; magorrian & tremaine @xcite ) to suggest that slow tidal inspiral may be at least as important as prompt disruption for feeding the mbh and for producing tidal flares .",
    "simulations ( murphy et al .",
    "@xcite ; freitag & benz @xcite ) indicate that prompt tidal disruptions supply between @xmath19 to @xmath20 of the total mass of a low mass mbh ( @xmath21 ) in a low - density galactic nuclear core .",
    "if the contribution of inspiraling stars were indeed as high as implied by the ratio of the cross - sections , this would have far - reaching implications : stars could supply most or even all of the mbh mass , thereby establishing a direct link between @xmath11 and stellar dynamics on a scale of @xmath10 .",
    "however , a small initial periapse does not in itself guarantee ultimate disruption .",
    "the star must also have enough time to complete its orbital decay . in this letter",
    "we revisit the questions : what is the time available for orbital decay , and what is the inspiral event rate ?",
    "we follow the analysis of miralda - escud & gould ( @xcite , mg00 ) of the infall of a single mass population of stellar bhs into a mbh by diffusion into the loss - cone due to 2-body encounters in a keplerian potential .",
    "stars scattered from a volume @xmath22 to a periapse @xmath3 will spiral into the mbh in a time @xmath23 , determined by the dissipation process .",
    "the scattering rate per volume of stars into orbits with periapse @xmath24 , @xmath25 , can be estimated for the steady state distribution function ( df ) ( mg00 eq .",
    "the total rate , @xmath26 , is obtained by integrating over the volume between an inner boundary @xmath27 where the stellar cusp is truncated ( e.g by stellar collisions ) to an outer boundary @xmath28 .",
    "the outer boundary is set by requiring that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the orbit - averaged time for a change of order unity in the periapse by diffusion in velocity space due to many small angle deflections .",
    "typically , @xmath31 rises with @xmath32 while @xmath33 falls ( eq .  [ eq : tr ] ) , and so there is a critical semi - major axis @xmath34 such that @xmath35 .",
    "stars originating from an orbit with @xmath36 do not have time , _ on average _ , to complete the inspiral .",
    "this simple condition is actually too restrictive because @xmath37 shrinks with time .",
    "since stars are scattered off the orbit at a rate of @xmath38 , the poisson probability for avoiding this is @xmath39 , where @xmath40\\,.\\label{eq : s}\\ ] ] the critical semi - major axis is obtained by solving @xmath41 for @xmath34 .",
    "formally , @xmath42 should be evaluated by the weighted integral @xmath43 over all space .",
    "however @xmath44 falls off exponentially , and so @xmath42 is well approximated by taking @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the time - averaged radius on an @xmath47 keplerian orbit .",
    "we assume here a simple power - law stellar df , @xmath48 . in the limit @xmath49 ( mg00 eqs .  1518 , 21 )    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the number of stars within @xmath10 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and@xmath54 note that @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the opening angle of the loss cone at @xmath57 , so eq .
