    "during his remarkable bakerian lecture at june 19 , 1941 , the published version of which dates back to 1942 @xcite , p.a.m .",
    "dirac summarized in his decisive manner a by now very influential conception of the physical world to which he had contributed more than significantly ( see also e.g.  @xcite ! ) .. as bosonic particles do not follow pauli s exclusion principle , dirac s concept of filling up negative energy states could not be applied to bosonic systems .",
    "hence , dirac positioned the bosonic vacuum at @xmath0 , in order to avoid bose - einstein condensation of bosonic particles towards @xmath1 . admitting",
    "hereby bosonic particles of only positive energy dirac found nevertheless a very elegant way to make use of the negative energy eigenstates of a bosonic system .",
    "dirac noticed that bosonic states of negative energy have simultaneously also _ negative norm _ and _ negative probability _",
    "( see also @xcite ! ) . therefore dirac @xcite declared bosonic negative energy states to be _",
    "responsible for the annihilation ( i.e.  absorption ) of positive energy particles _ ( the negative energy states discussed in @xcite reflect and support nicely this interpretation of dirac ( even for fermions ) , even though completely differently interpreted by the respective author ! ) . strictly speaking , dirac associated even bosonic positive energy states with the _ emission _ of bosonic particles and _ not _ with their _ existence _ ! ]    from a modern point of view the conception of dirac has besides a rather asymmetric treatment of fermions and bosons its particular drawbacks in two points causing serious difficulties in their theoretical handling : the mere existence of a `` dirac sea '' with its infinite negative energy ( causing in particular problems to cosmologists ) and the missing description of bosonic antiparticles .    in vol .  1 of his book `` the quantum theory of fields '' @xcite s.  weinberg seems to suggest that both problems have been surpassed by formalisms developed 1934 by w.  pauli and v.  weisskopf ( for spin 0 bosons ) @xcite and w.h .",
    "furry and j.r .",
    "oppenheimer ( for spin 1/2 fermions ) @xcite .",
    "furry and oppenheimer picked up dirac s idea that the positron is the absence of a negative - energy electron ; the anticommutation relations are symmetric between creation and annihilation operators , so they defined the positron creation and annihilation operators as the corresponding annihilation and creation operators for negative - energy electrons @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( for @xmath4 ) where the label @xmath5 on @xmath6 denotes a positive - energy positron mode with momenta and spin opposite to those of the electron mode @xmath5 . @xmath7 it is necessary also to specify that the physical vacuum is a state @xmath8 containing no positive - energy electrons or positrons : @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) @xmath7''_. then , in the context of the work of w.  pauli and v.  weisskopf , he remarks on p.  26",
    "ff in @xcite : _",
    "`` @xmath7 the existence of two different kinds of operators @xmath13 and @xmath6 , which appear in precisely the same way in the hamiltonian , shows that this is a theory with two kinds of particles with the same mass . as emphasized by pauli and weisskopf , these two varieties can be identified as particles and the corresponding antiparticles , and if charged have opposite charges .",
    "thus as we stressed above , bosons of spin zero as well as fermions of spin 1/2 can have distinct antiparticles , which for bosons can not be identified as holes in a sea of negative energy particles @xmath7''_. in the course of time even dirac changed  according to s.  weinberg  his point of view as is stated on p.  13",
    "ff in @xcite : _ `` @xmath7 and",
    "if the hole theory does not work for bosonic antiparticles , why should we believe it for fermions ?",
    "i asked dirac in 1972 how he then felt about this point ; he told me that he did not regard bosons like the pion or @xmath14 as ` important ' . in a lecture",
    "a few years later , dirac referred to the fact that for bosons ` we no longer have the picture of a vacuum with negative energy states filled up ' , and remarked that in this case ` the whole theory becomes more complicated ' .",
    "@xmath7''_. ] _ if _ one characterizes stable particles serving as asymptotic states by _ real _ energies , then one might be tempted to agree _ for such real energy particles _ to the view of pauli , weisskopf , furry and oppenheimer ( pwfo ) ( adverted by weinberg and finally also by dirac ) , as the introduction of two operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 for particles and antiparticles , respectively , being related by @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath4 indeed admits the vacuum to be positioned at @xmath0 , while the operator @xmath16 reflects even without a dirac sea all properties of holes in dirac s sea of negative _ real _ energy states .",
    "furthermore the concept has the advantage to be applicable not only to fermions , but also to bosons . yet",
    " as will be explained in more detail below  the view of pwfo _ can not _ be kept as it stands without inconsistency , when one tries to formulate a local , causal , analytic and poincar - covariant quantum theory ( qt ) for systems with complex - valued selfenergies and vertex - functions .",
    "the result of such an exercise @xcite may be called nhqt or ( a)cqt and will be described to some extend in the following text .",
    "it will yield a `` revised '' conception of the physical world treating fermions and bosons completely symmetrically and being free of the above conjectured inconsistency arising not only in the early conception by dirac , but also in the subsequent , more sophisticated conception by pwfo adverted e.g.  by weinberg ( see also @xcite ! ) .",
    "this inconsistency , the resolution of which is a striking argument in favour of ( a)cqt , may be sketched as simple as follows :    assume that @xmath17 is the annihilation operator of a _ causal _ particle with _ complex _ energy @xmath18 ( re@xmath19 > 0 $ ] , im@xmath19 < 0 $ ] ) .",
    "then the respective creation operator of the particle with _ complex _ energy @xmath18 is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 according to pwfo ) .",
    "the hermitian conjugation of @xmath20 leads then to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 according to pwfo ) being the annihilation operator of an _ anticausal _ particle with the _ complex conjugated _ energy @xmath24 , and not to the annihilation operator of a _ causal _ antiparticle with energy @xmath18 , as suggested by pwfo . for completeness",
    "we note that @xmath25 is the creation operator of the _ anticausal _ particle with energy @xmath24 .",
    "and @xmath26 mesons when performing the identification @xmath27 .",

    "<S> present hermitian quantum theory ( hqt ) , i.e.  quantum mechanics ( qm ) and quantum field theory ( qft ) , is revised and replaced by a consistent non - hermitian formalism called non - hermitian quantum theory ( nhqt ) or ( anti)causal quantum theory ( ( a)cqt ) after lining out some inherent inconsistencies and problems arising in the context of causality , which is observed to introduce an indefinite metric in canonical commutation relations . choosing some ( very selective ) historical approach to introduce necessary terminology and explain complications when quantizing non - hermitian systems in the presence of an indefinite metric we propose a way how to construct a causal , analytic , poincar invariant , and local nhqt , the spacial representation of which is related to the so - called holomorphic representation used in complex analysis . besides providing a revised antiparticle , spinor , and probability concept , a new neutrino lagrangean , two distinct time - reversal operations , and generalized non - hermitian poincar transformations , we will apply nhqt to consider three important issues : pt - symmetry and non - hermitian similarity transforms , non - hermitian supersymmetry , and the construction of an asymptotically free theory of strong interactions without gluons . </S>"
