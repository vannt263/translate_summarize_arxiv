    "a general finding of recent years is that all globular clusters ( gcs ) so far spectroscopically examined contain multiple stellar populations .",
    "this is significatively shown in the recent analysis of @xcite of about two thousand stars in 19 gcs , showing that all these clusters display the sodium ",
    "oxygen anticorrelation , signature of the presence of a population of stars sodium richer and oxygen poorer than the halo stars of the same metallicity .",
    "the na  o anti  correlation is typical of gcs , whose constituent stars belong to two or more stellar populations differing in the abundances of the elements produced by the hot cno cycle and by other proton capture reactions on light nuclei .",
    "in fact , these chemical signatures are present also in turn  off stars and among the subgiants ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so they can not be imputed to  in situ \" mixing in the stars , but must be due to some process of self  enrichment occurring at the first stages of the cluster life .",
    "photometric evidences for the presence of multiple populations are also numerous , and sometimes suggestive of star formation occurring in separate successive bursts .",
    "the photometric signatures of different populations can be imputed in part to helium differences , inferred from the morphology of the horizontal branches ( hb ) @xcite , or from the presence of multiple main sequences , @xcite .    in view of all this , at present the formation of globular clusters is considered a two  step process lasting no longer than @xmath2100 myr , during which the nuclearly processed matter from a  first generation \" ( fg ) of stars gives birth , in the cluster innermost regions , to a  second generation \" ( sg ) of stars with the characteristic signature of a distribution of element abundances fully cno  cycled .    in this regard ,",
    "a major problem remains and is rarely faced : the spectroscopic information shows that , in the clusters so far examined , the percentage of stars of the sg is generally @xmath25080% @xcite , as also results by interpreting the hb morphologies in terms of helium enrichment @xcite .",
    "this large percentage can not be the result of chemical evolution within a  closed box \" , simply because the processed matter available from the more massive stars is always a small percentage of the fg mass8 to 12% of the initial cluster mass , depending on the imf , see e.g. vesperini et al . 2010 . ] .",
    "anomalous initial mass functions of the fg may help , but they pose further problems for the dynamical survival of clusters ; instead , it seems necessary that the matter forming the sg stars is collected from a much larger stellar ensemble . in other words ,",
    "the cluster has managed to lose most of its fg stars , and is now the  small \" remnant of the evolution of a much more massive and maybe also of a much bigger stellar system .",
    "so the first proposal on the subject , by bekki & norris ( 2006 ) , assumes that all gcs are formed within dwarf galaxies , that are now dispersed .",
    "this kind of formation is generally accepted to have occurred in the most massive clusters , such as @xmath4  cen , m22 , and in m54 , the cluster belonging to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "these clusters show also metallicity spreads ( e.g. , among others * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are not present in most of the other clusters .",
    "more difficult it is to believe that _ all _ gcs have formed within dwarf galaxies .",
    "we point out , e.g. , that old massive clusters in the magellanic clouds also show the na  o anticorrelation @xcite .    a different proposal to explain the presence of multiple stellar populations in galactic gcs , with the observed number fractions of fg and sg stars ,",
    "was advanced by @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the loss of most of the fg stars at early phases , during the formation of the sg stars in a cooling flow at the cluster center .",
    "the idea in support of this model is that the mass loss from the explosion of supernovae type ii",
    "( sn  ii ) , and the associated loss of the remnant gas from which the fg stars had formed , occurring just previous to the formation of the sg , produce an expansion of the cluster , leading to a loss of a significant fraction of fg stars .",
    "@xcite show that 90% or more of the initial fg mass may be lost , so that the sg may become an important fraction of the total stellar population , even overcoming the fg .",
    "however , if the cluster total size was strongly under filling its tidal radius , or the cluster evolved in isolation , the fg can not be lost and the cluster dynamically survives to the sn  ii epoch , maybe leaving a looser cluster structure as fingerprint of the mass loss from the sn  ii explosions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this case , the sg formation remains _ a small perturbation in the cluster history _ , and can not represent more than a few percent of the total ( mainly  fg cluster ) .    of course , true ",
    "fg  only \" clusters should exist : those in which a sg could not form because their inital mass was too low to allow for the formation of a cooling flow @xcite . these clusters will generally survive only if they do not interact strongly with the galactic gravitational field , otherwhise the expansion due to the sn  ii mass loss will lead to the cluster disruption .",
    "the fact that most gcs so far examined host a large fraction of sg stars seems to imply that the very formation of a sg that occurs after the sn  ii epoch and is not subject to the cluster expansion and its dynamical interaction with the fg stars allowed massive clusters to survive in a tidally limited environment @xcite , although they lose more than 90% of the initial mass .    a dynamical identification of these two important classes of clusters ( fg - only and mainly - fg ) is particularly complicated as it would require a reliable reconstruction of the individual cluster dynamical histories and initial structural properties .",
    "for example , ngc 2419 is strongly underfilling its jacobi radius ( r@xmath5 ) , the tidal radius of the cluster due to the galactic field , computed in the plain roche approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , defined by its present mass and galactocentric distance ; on the basis of its current structural properties and position in the galaxy , one might naively consider ngc  2419 to be a good candidate of a  mainly - fg \" cluster .",
    "however as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , its eccentric orbit @xcite and/or , possibly , a different galactic environment in its early stages of evolution must have caused a large mass loss , and this cluster appears to contain a significant fraction of sg stars .",
    "we point out that the formation of the sg subsystem is likely to have a significant impact on the cluster structural properties .",
    "while young clusters in nearby galaxies form compact , with a half  mass radius r@xmath6@xmath11  pc @xcite , they expand thanks to mass loss by stellar winds and sn  ii explosions in the first 30myr of life ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this expansion may be enhanced if the cluster is initially mass segregated @xcite . if the sg forms in a cooling flow , this leads naturally again to an even more compact stellar distribution @xcite , with a small r@xmath6",
    "otherwise , if the sg does not form , the cluster maintains the larger r@xmath6  acquired in the first expansion phase , so a cluster may be tidally filling ( e.g. r@xmath6/r@xmath5@xmath30.1 , * ? ? ?",

    "one easy way to recognize the presence of a second generation in a gc is to consider the morphology of the hb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "historically , the dispersion in mass along the hb was imputed to a dispersion in mass loss @xcite , but recent developments have shown that it may be in large part due to differences in helium content , that appear together with the chemical signatures of the second generation ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . as discussed in @xcite , bimodal hbs , blue tails , gaps in the stars distribution and ,",
    "in general , hbs that extend from the red to the faint blue are the most clear candidates for the presence of multiple stellar generations . as for less extreme morphologies , the case of m  3 was examined in detail by @xcite .",
    "while an appropriate dispersion in mass loss ( @xmath23@xmath24 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows to reproduce the ratios in number among the hb components ( red , variable , blue ) , the detailed color distribution along the hb and the rr  lyraes peaked period distribution can not be reproduced by a  normal \" population with mass spread . on the contrary , a generation of stars with normal helium , with a very small mass dispersion ( @xmath25@xmath24 ) can account very well for the red and variable hb members , while the blue region is populated by a second stars generation with variable helium .",
    "the very good fit obtained in these conditions for the number vs. period distribution of rr lyr stars , otherwhise unattainable @xcite strongly supports this interpretation .         in this framework",
    ", the single population gcs should be identified by an hb that can be reproduced by _ the evolution of an almost unique mass_. we adopt the presence of a  short \" hb as a first indication of an fg cluster , and then consider its dynamical status . to single out the candidates we examined the color magnitude ( cm ) diagrams in the databases by @xcite and by @xcite , covering a total of 96 gcs .",

    "besides , we exclude those clusters with [ fe / h]@xmath30.8 that show an exclusively red hb . in these cases ,",
    "even if an sg is present , it is not easily identifiable with simple photometric criteria ( see , e.g. , the case of 47 tuc discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "after this first screening , we are left with 86 cm diagrams , among which fg clusters must be identified .",
    "only one cluster is left with a red hb ( ngc  6652 ) . for the others ,",
    "whose hb is blue , we select those in which the extension in v magnitude of the hb does not exceed 1  mag .",
    "we further exclude the clusters ( with a short blue hb ) for which the o  na anticorrelation has been observed , namely : m30 , ngc 6397 @xcite and ngc 7492 @xcite .",
    "when available , we checked the results on more than one cm diagram .",
    "these checks allowed to eliminate clusters that in a first moment looked like fg .",
    "a clear example is given by ngc 6535 , that looks like hosting a blue hb of about 1 visual magnitude range in the data by @xcite .",
    "a look at the photometry by sarajedini ( 1994 ) shows that the hb extends for @xmath21.8 visual magnitudes , and , further , that it contains two very faint extreme hb stars . on this basis , this cluster was excluded .",
    "we consider , in addition , a group of small mass ( 1.54.5 @xmath26@xmath24 ) , far away clusters ( galactocentric distance d@xmath2770kpc ) : am1 , eridanus , pal 3 , pal 4 , pal 14 , apparently 12  gyr younger than m 3 , but of similar metallicity .",
    "their hbs are short , exclusively red , except for pal 3 , in which 7 rr  lyr variables are found .",

    "the presence of rr  lyraes is a further indication of the extension in color of the hb , although the fact that they are generally very few indicates that the rr  lyr gap is likely traversed by stars evolving out of the zahb ( see later ) .",
    "several of the 17 selected clusters have a small ( present ) mass .",
    "it is possible that also in the past this mass was small enough that the clusters could not form the sg stars .",

    "the total number and overall behaviour of rr  lyraes ( see fig.[f5 ] ) are reasonably reproduced by the simulation presented in fig .",
    "we did not consider necessary to obtain a better agreement of the period distribution , even if in principle this appears possible , as we know by experience @xcite . in our simulation ,",
    "the slight asymmetry in the histogram of number versus mass shown in fig.[f4 ] is due to the presence of the small percentage of stars with higher helium content , but the same result could be obtained by assuming a slight asymmetry in the mass lost along the red giant branch .",
    "we examined the relative spatial distribution of the faintest hb stars relative to the other hb members and to the red giants having v@xmath118 .",
    "the comparison employs @xcite data , converting the pixel scale of their data base by knowing that 1 pixel = 0.22 arcsec and is shown in fig.[f6 ] .",
    "while the red giant branch and the main body of hb stars have the same cumulative distribution , the fainter hb stars appear indeed more concentrated .",
    "is this an indication in favour of our interpretation , as the small sg would have formed in the very core of the cluster where the cooling flow concentrates the gas from the agb ejecta ?",
    "the study of dynamical mixing of two stellar generations , the second one formed exclusively in the core , is limited , until today , to the n ",
    "body simulations presented by @xcite in the context of their model for gc formation .",
    "further study is certainly needed to understand whether the current properties of m  53 ( table 1 ) are consistent with the observed only partial mixing of sg and fg .",
    "m  53 is not unique in this respect .",
    "e.g. a central concentration for the sg is found in ngc  3201 by @xcite and @xcite , and in ngc  6752 by @xcite .",
    "the second line of interpretation , that the giants in the cluster core suffer stronger dynamical interactions and are subject to a stronger mass loss , should also be carefully tested by modelling the interactions in the cluster core . at present",
    ", we suggest that spectroscopic information ( e.g. the presence or lack of high sodium and low oxygen in a small fraction of m  53 red giants ) would be the best observationsl test of either hypothesis . at the present stage",
    ", we propose that current data show some evidence that m  53 is a ",
    "mainly  fg \" cluster",
    ".    visual inspection of their cm diagrams indicate that ngc 5634 , ngc 5694 and ngc 6101 have hb characteristics very similar to those of m  53 , so they can also be mainly  fg candidates , and it would be important to assess their chemical properties as well .",
    "notice that only ngc  6101 is tidally filling : the other three clusters ( including m  53 ) have a small ratio r@xmath6/rj , and actually lie close to the line giving the position of a cluster of 10@xmath55@xmath24  with r@xmath6=3  pc in the plane r@xmath6/r@xmath5  _ vs. _ d@xmath30  of figure 2 in @xcite .",
    "our analysis started from the consideration that the dynamical status of a cluster ( tidally limited or not ) at its formation time , or later on during the course of its life would determine its evolution and survival .",
    "however , since it is not straightforward to go back from the present dynamical status to the previous dynamical evolution , we resorted to a pure photometric parameter ( the morphology of the hb ) to select fg  clusters . in this way we have not only recovered",
    "that pal  3 is an fg  only cluster @xcite , but we have also shown that m  53 may be an example of a mainly  fg cluster .    at this point",
    "it is relevant to enquire how would be like a cluster , in principle similar to m  53 , in which the sg appears to be a relevant constituent .",
    "we consider ngc  2419 , a metal poor , far away , isolated cluster ( table 1 ) .",
    "it is twice as massive as m  53 , and much farther from filling its galactic tidal radius than m  53 : the comparison between the truncation radius and jacobi radius provides a ratio r@xmath56/r@xmath5  = 0.57 for m  53 and only 0.28 for ngc  2419 .    versus the color m@xmath57m@xmath58  presented in di criscienzo et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "the histogram of colour and magnitude distributions are also shown as full ( blue ) .",
    "superimposed we show a simulation of the entire hb , obtained by fitting the luminous part with 390 stars having standard helium abundance y=0.24 , mass loss @xmath59m=0.073@xmath24  and spread in the hb masses @xmath42=0.008 , the middle part with 90 stars having the same y=0.24 and @xmath59m=0.22@xmath24 , @xmath42=0.05@xmath24 ; the blue hook is reproduced with 160 stars with y=0.42 , @xmath59m=0.110@xmath24  and @xmath60@xmath24 .",
    "further assumption of the models for the blue hook stars are provided in di criscienzo et al .",
    "the histograms of the simulation are dot  dashed . ,",
    "width=302 ]    given the similarity in heavy element abundance , we can compare the hbs of m  53 and ngc  2419 ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . as mentioned before , the brighter regions of the hb are very similar : the same concentration of hb members in a very small color interval on the blue side of the variable region , with rr  lyr and red hb stars likely the product of these blue stars , as discussed in the simulation of m  53 hb ( fig.[f3 ] ) .",
    "but the hb in ngc  2419 continues , with a lower star density , well beyond the limit in m  53 , ending with the most populated ( @xmath230% of the hb stars ! ) blue hook known in galactic gcs @xcite .",
    "although @xcite argue that the symmetric distribution of stars along the ms favours a single stellar population model for this cluster , @xcite have discussed that both the hb morphology and the colour distribution of the giants suggest the presence of two well separated populations , one of which has a very high helium content .",
    "they also show that the partial asymmetry that would result in the ms colour distribution would be hidden by the present photometric errors .",
    "if this is the case , the dynamical evolution of this cluster can not have occurred in isolation , as a much larger initial mass would have been required to provide the 30% very helium rich population presently found in ngc  2419 . the small spread in calcium present among the giants in ngc  2419 @xcite also shows that this cluster was able to retain at least some sn  ii ejecta , spectroscopically excluding the fg  only possibility . in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we show a simulation of the whole hb of ngc  2419 , well reproducing the whole extension in colour and magnitude of this extreme hb . in order to reproduce the upper hb we assumed y=0.24 and @xmath42=0.008@xmath24 .",
    "the long tail , between the more luminous peak of stars and the blue hook , is reproduced by 90 stars , and assuming the same helium content and a broader and larger mass loss ( @xmath59m=0.22@xmath24 @xmath42= 0.05@xmath24 ) .",
    "a similar fit is obtained by assuming stars with increased and variable helium content , and a smaller spread in mass loss , as described above for m  53 . for the blue hook",
    "we assume y=0.42 and @xmath42=0.01@xmath24 .",
    "the blue hook simulation follows the prescriptions explained in @xcite , to which we refer for details .",
    "we adopted a simple photometric criterion ( the extension of the hb ) to select candidates for fg clusters from existing large databases of cm diagrams of gcs .",
    "the list of 17 candidates is tentatively divided into 8 fg  only clusters ( that could not form an sg at all ) and 9 mainly  fg clusters ( that could form an sg , but did not lose most of the fg mass ) . the small percentage of mainly ",
    "fg clusters indicates that very few of the clusters that develop the sg do not lose a high fraction of their initial mass , and we suggest that non isolated clusters are destroyed by the dynamical interaction with the galactic tidal field , unless they are able to form a sg , whose dynamical mixing with the fg stars allows the cluster to survive ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we studied in more detail the hbs of pal  3 , m  53 and , for comparison , ngc  2419 .",
    "we found a similarity between the hb in m  53 and the upper hb in ngc  2419 , the total cluster mass being the only evident difference between them .",
    "given their structural similarity , we may be witnessing the influence of total mass _ only _ on the first evolutionary stages in gc life ( or at least , in the very metal poor ones ) .",
    "the three clusters represent very different evolutionary cases :    \\1 ) pal  3 is consistent with hosting a fg  only population .",
    "\\2 ) m  53 , a much more massive cluster , has a hb consistent with an almost pure fg population ; by examining synthetic models for its hb stellar distribution , we suggest that a small second generation may be present ( mainly  fg cluster ) , given by the bluest and faintest hb stars , mostly concentrated in the cluster inner regions .",
    "\\3 ) ngc  2419 , more than double the mass of m  53 and close in mass to the most massive clusters in the galaxy , with an apparently `` evident '' chemical and dynamical isolated evolution , exhibits a consistent blue hook , a crucial signature of the presence of multiple star generations .",
    "so it is reasonable to expect strong chemical anomalies in this cluster ( o  na and mg  al anticorrelations )  not yet observed , given its extreme distance .",
    "the presence of a small spread in calcium @xcite testifies however that this cluster was able to retain at least some sn  ii ejecta , spectroscopically excluding the fg  only possibility .",
    "we have presented reasons to support the hypothesis that m  53 is a mainly  fg cluster .",
    "were this the case , and if , as likely , the chemical and dynamical evolution of the cluster had taken place within its tidal radius , the interesting possibility would arise of estimating the percentage of second generation stars resulting from such evolution , after estimating the stellar losses due to two  body interactions during the galactic lifetime . to clarify this scenario , it would be important to obtain a cm diagram of m  53 with modern telescopes , in order to establish with higher precision the colour of the population peak on the hb .",
    "in fact , the large part of the hb members with smaller colours can be assumed to belong to the second generation , once excluded the possibility of an asymmetry in mass loss along the rg branch .",
    "this derives from the fact that the evolution of zahb members bluer than the rr  lyrae strip develops strictly redward . at present",
    ", the fraction of the sg seems to be @xmath2 0.1 ( = 50/500 ) , but this is surely an approximate value .    the consistency of hb morphologies with chemical characteristics known at present , even if encouraging , must be substantiated by spectroscopic investigations of the giant branches of all the three clusters , to put in evidence the presence / absence of , e.g. , the na  o anticorrelation .",
    "we hope that this information will help to establish a few firm points in this complex subject .",
