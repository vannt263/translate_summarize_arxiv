    "the unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) predicts that the ability of an accretion disk - black hole system to produce powerful relativistic jets is the main reason of the observed differences between radio loud ( rl ) and radio quiet ( rq ) sources .",
    "geometrical effects , through the relative inclination of an axisymmetric system with respect to the line of sight , can explain the majority of the differences between the various subclasses @xcite .",
    "although this model does work well to first order , it leaves still open a number of problems .",
    "in particular , a key question still to be fully answered is why powerful relativistic jets are produced only in @xmath7% of agn , and if and how this is related to the structure of the accretion flow in the rl and rq sources . in other words , an often debated issue is how accretion and ejecta in agn are linked , and how these mechanisms work under different physical conditions ( e.g. , @xcite ; for a parallel with x - ray binaries , see @xcite ) . a closely related question concerns the evolution of the jets , and its link with the observational subclasses of rl .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the relativistic jet originates in the innermost regions , and as the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight decreases , the importance of its emission increases , due to beaming effects .",
    "this simple picture does not account for the whole rl phenomenology , different global properties being associated to sources with different radio morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a key observational challenge in rl agn is to disentangle the jet contribution from the disk emission , which could allow us to better understand what are the main differences in the nuclear regions between rl and rq sources .",
    "previous x - ray observations of rq and rl objects established that these sources exhibit spectra with subtle but significant differences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray emission of rq objects appears to be described at first order by a primary power - law continuum , with features resulting from the reprocessing of this primary continuum from cold and warm gas , like the iron k line complex at @xmath2kev , the reflection component , and often ionized absorption and emission features .",
    "the main observed difference between rl and rq sources is that the features due to reprocessing in rl agn appear to be weaker compared to the rq population ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    to account for these properties ,",
    "several scenarios have been suggested .",
    "highly ionized accretion disks , different from the standard , cold disk typical of seyferts , could be obtained if the accretion rates are high @xcite .",
    "a difference in the inner accretion disks of blrgs and rqs could result in a small solid angle subtended in rls by the disk to the primary x - ray source @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "assuming the same disk structure in both populations , dilution by non - thermal jet emission could weaken the reprocessing features @xcite .",
    "it is however important to notice that in the last few years xmm-_newton _  and _ suzaku_are changing this simplistic view : observations of large samples of rq agn are showing a large spread in the x - ray properties of this class , with a wider range of continuum slopes and with several cases of sources having little or no reflection .",
    "it is thus emerging that the distinction between the two classes is not so sharp , but rather that rl objects populate one end of the distribution for seyferts and quasars ( qsos ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "strong signatures of low- and high - velocity outflows are rather common in rq ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "warm absorbers ( outflowing with velocities @xmath8km / s ) are detected in the soft x - ray spectra of more than half of local seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their location at @xmath9pc suggests a possible association with the optical broad line region ( blr ) or narrow line region .",
    "ultra - fast outflows , showing velocities @xmath10km / s , have been found to be present in @xmath11% of local seyferts @xcite .",
    "their location on sub - pc scales suggests a direct association with accretion disk winds / outflows .",
    "regarding rl objects , only in the last few years have sensitive and broad - band observations started to detect disk winds / outflows in broad line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) .",
    "_ chandra _  and xmm-_newton _  observations of 3c  382  revealed the presence of a warm absorber with outflow - like properties @xcite , while 3c  445 shows signatures of soft x - ray photoionized gas in emission and absorption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our _ suzaku _",
    "observations provided evidence for ultra - fast disk outflows in 3/5 blrgs ( blueshift velocity @xmath12 , and mass outflow rates comparable to the accretion rates ; * ? ? ?",
    "differences in terms of the strength of the reflection features , as well as the presence or lack of warm absorbers or high - velocity outflows , in sources showing different radio properties is one of the natural consequences of the so - called `` gap - paradigm '' @xcite .",
    "its main ingredient is the relative orientation of the disk and the black hole spin ; the ability of the source of producing powerful jets is related to retrograde systems . in particular",
    ", this model accounts for the weaker reflection features observed in blrgs , a natural consequence of the larger gap between the innermost stable circular orbit of the disk and the black hole in retrograde sources than in prograde objects . at the same time",
    ", the model provides a simple interpretation for the presence or absence of signatures of disk winds , depending on the size of the gap region and the accretion efficiency .",
    "an additional complication in the study of the properties of the accretion flow in rl and rq , is the presence in the former of emission due to the jet , that can mask the thermal emission ( directly observed and/or reprocessed ) from the disk . from the observational point of view , only through a wide energy coverage and good sensitivity at medium - hard x - rays , can we attempt to disentangle the contribution of the jet and the disk emission .",
    "the request of both simultaneous broadband coverage and high sensitivity in the iron k line region has now been achieved with _",
    "suzaku_. we then started a program aimed to observe with this satellite the brightest ( and best studied ) blrgs . here",

    "we note that the _ swift _  spectrum is averaged over more than @xmath24years .",
    "the strong variability previously mentioned is clearly evident when all the datasets are plotted together . in order to understand the driver of the variability , we fitted all the datasets together , adopting the best - fit continuum model of the _ suzaku _  data , i.e.  an absorbed cutoff power law plus a reflection component and the iron k complex ; since the comparison between _ suzaku _  and xmm-_newton _",
    "spectra shows that the lines do not vary with the continuum , we fixed the reprocessing features to the best fit value found for _",
    "suzaku_.    as a first step , we allowed only the relative normalization of the primary power law to vary between the observations . for observations extending down to a few kev ,",
    "also the column density was allowed to vary .",
    "this fit already provides a reasonable representation of the sed ( @xmath25 ) , our aim being to investigate the variations in the main spectral properties ( continuum slope and emission intensity ) , and not to find a detailed description of all the spectra .",
    "however , to further investigate the observed variability , we also allowed the power - law photon index to vary ; the observed change of intensity and spectral shape is summarized in table  [ tab:111sed ] ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we obtained rather similar values of the photon index , spanning a range from @xmath27 ( _ swift _ ) to @xmath28 ( xmm-_newton _  from 2001 ) .",
    "the only outlier is the _ integral _  observation , for which we obtain @xmath29 .",
    "this is probably due to the low quality of the data , confirmed by the poor constraints to the value of @xmath30 , coupled with the high - energy cutoff applied , @xmath31kev . fitting the data with a simple power law",
    "would increase a little the best - fit value of the photon index , although with strong residuals at the high - energy end of the spectrum .",

    ", the stronger variation is observed between the _ suzaku _  and the xmm-_newton _  ( from 2001 ) data .",
    "this analysis shows that a brightening of the source does not imply a flatter power law , thus suggesting that the main driver of the increase in the flux may not be a strong increase in the jet component .",
    "although our analysis is limited by the number of spectra , we note that the photon indices are well constrained thanks to the use of soft x - ray data as well as data above @xmath6kev . after excluding the _ integral _  point",

    ", we have blrgs showing a spread of the jet angle with respect to the line of sight . despite the strong uncertainties in the orientation , the closest candidate to be compared to 3c",
    "111  is 3c  382 .",
    "recently , from high - quality _ suzaku _  data @xcite estimated for this blrg a disk inclination of @xmath39 ; at bigger scales , radio observations found a lower limit to the inclination angle of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the best estimate of the jet inclination for 3c  111  is @xmath41 , with a proposed range of @xmath42 @xcite . despite this similarity ,",
    "the x - ray emission of the two sources is remarkably different , with 3c  382  showing an x - ray spectrum more similar to that observed from seyfert galaxies .",
    "this implies that the relative importance of the jet is not related only to geometrical properties ( i.e. , orientation with respect to the line of sight ) .",
    "different velocities , or a bent jet , can play an important role .",
    "finally , the x - ray emission of 3c  111  appears significantly different from that of a typical seyfert galaxy in many aspects , e.g.  flatter intrinsic emission and weak reflection features . on the other hand",
    ", its time variability shows properties that correlate with the black hole mass , following the same scaling law observed in stellar - mass black hole x - ray binaries and seyfert galaxies , suggesting that a similar accretion process is powering these different systems @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting the large dispersion of intrinsic x - ray properties shown by rl agn ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , similar to the one found out for the rq sources .",
    "the overlapping of the distributions of photon index and reflection features observed in both classes supports the idea of common accretion structure , with a second parameter in addition to the accretion rate that determines the jet production efficiency .",
    "the most likely candidate is the black hole spin , although how does it works in producing the observed rls - rqs dichotomy , or the fris - friis division , is still strongly debated ( e.g. , the `` spin paradigm '' coupled with intermittent jet activity , @xcite ; or the `` gap paradigm '' , @xcite ) . in particular , in the heuristic scenario proposed by garofalo et al .",
    ", collimated jets coupled with intermediate accretion efficiency , as observed in 3c  111  ( see table  [ tab : src ] ) , can occur for retrograde systems .",
    "this configuration also implies a larger size of the gap region between the inner edge of accretion disks and the black hole horizon , size that is connected to the energetics of the disk itself .",
    "the weakness of reflection features is a natural consequence of such a configuration ; moreover , larger gap regions can limit the presence of disk winds @xcite .",
    "unstable outflows , weaker than in rq agn , could be therefore compatible with high excitation frii states , such in 3c  111  @xcite , while at the extreme end , radiatively inefficient accretion flows in low excitation radio galaxies ( @xmath43 ) might inhibit the launch of disk winds .",
    "in this paper we presented the x - ray spectra of 3c  111 , obtained with _",

    "observation of @xmath44ksec is analysed as well .",
    "the 3c  111  emission extends up to @xmath45kev , with a rather flat continuum ; in spite of this , no signatures of jet emission are visible below @xmath6kev .",

    "the intensities of the line detected by xmm-_newton _  and _ suzaku _  are consistent , with a lack of immediate response of the line properties to the continuum variation .",
    "in addition to the iron k complex , absorption features due to a highly ionized , ultra - fast , nuclear outflowing gas are detected in the xis data . at the time of the xmm-_newton _",
    "observation , the gas has varied : adopting the photoionized absorber as seen in the _ suzaku_data , then a lower column density and lower ionization state are required . both xis data and rgs spectra show the presence of a narrow line at @xmath46kev , which is most likely identified with either the @xmath47  rrc or the @xmath48  triplet lines .",
    "the lack of detection of a roll - over in the primary emission is probably due to the appearance of the jet as a dominant component in the hard x - ray band , as suggested by the detection with the gso on - board _ suzaku _  above @xmath3kev . from a qualitative point of view ,",
    "the emission observed by _ egret _  and _ fermi _  above @xmath22gev is compatible with such a jet component assuming that this peaks at energies of @xmath3mev .",
    "if the detection is confirmed , the emergence of a jet component can explain differences observed in the high - energy emission of blrgs similar in other aspects .",
    "the relative importance of the jet component is not simply related to the system inclination , but can be associated to the velocity of the jet ; a change of the opening angle of the jet passing from the nuclear region , where the observed x - ray emission is produced , to the most distant regions , where the radio emission is observed , may also play a role .",
    "finally , we presented the high - energy historical sed for 3c  111 , from x - ray to @xmath4-ray .",
    "our qualitative analysis suggests that the strong variability observed for 3c  111  is probably driven by a change in the primary continuum .",
    "this implies that simultaneous broad - band x - ray and @xmath4-ray monitoring is needed to unambiguously constrain the parameters of the disk - jet system , and correctly understand the contribution of the different components ( i.e. , disk emission , reflection , jet ) to the total emission .",
