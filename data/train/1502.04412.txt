    "the goal of this paper is to address the following question : what do the correlation functions look like for a massless field in de sitter space with a @xmath0 interaction ?",
    "this question is of more than merely formal interest ; it has direct connections to issues in inflationary theory .",
    "the inflationary geometry has many similarities to de sitter space ( especially in the earlier stages of inflation ) .",
    "furthermore , scalar fields play a fundamental role in inflation  @xcite , and correlation functions of these fields are recorded in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "current observations of the cmb from the wmap experiment  @xcite are currently almost exactly consistent with a scale invariant power spectrum .",
    "however , it would be surprising if the inflaton had no interactions whatsoever , and such interactions are expected to produce deviations from exact scale invariance  @xcite .",
    "several experiments have been searching for such nongaussianities . for comparison of these observations to theory ,",
    "it is important to be able to calculate correlation functions of these scalar fields in the inflationary background .",
    "unfortunately , the scalar fields in inflation are typically light ( @xmath1 ) , and for these small masses , it turns out that the loop corrections are important .",
    "in fact , loop corrections involving massless fields are infrared divergent @xcite . to compare theoretical predictions to observations ,",
    "it is crucial to be able to treat these divergences rigorously .",
    "this has led to a lot of work using many different approaches to try and resum these divergences formally both for scalars and gravitons . in some approaches",
    "the fact that one loop corrections are divergent for a massless field results in a self - consistent mass being developed . in other approaches , the propagator becomes time dependent , breaking de sitter invariance , and in yet other approaches particle production leads again to an induced mass for the field .",
    "all these techniques qualitatively lead to the result that the massless fields pick up a nonperturbative mass of order @xmath2 once interactions are included .",
    "however , one would expect that a short wavelength mode of the scalar field should be completely unaffected by the de sitter curvature ( in much the same way as current lab experiments do not take into account the curvature of the universe ) . a long wavelength mode , on the other hand , can plausibly be affected by the curvature and may pick up a dynamical mass ( indeed , this _ must _ happen in order to prevent divergences from occurring . ) . in short ,",
    "we expect any corrections to be momentum dependent , with large effects only for long wavelength modes .",
    "however , the loop effects found in the various approaches above often seem to affect all wavelengths equally , and usually the short wavelength modes acquire a mass .",
    "the reason for this is that the analyses in most of the above papers typically focus on _ one - loop _ corrections .",
    "however , in @xmath0 theory , the one - loop corrections have a very non - generic feature ; they are _ independent _ of the external momenta .",
    "this leads to the surprising effect detailed in the previous paragraph .",
    "this feature suggests that the one - loop corrections may not encode the relevant physics ; indeed , all one - loop corrections in @xmath0 theory can be completely canceled by the addition of a mass counterterm .",
    "this further suggests that the resolution of the divergences involves a study of the two - loop corrections in this theory . unlike the one - loop corrections , the 2-loop corrections are not independent of the external momenta .",
    "the long wavelength modes will then receive mass corrections which are different from the corrections to the short distance modes ; this then allows us to cancel off the mass for the short distance modes using the counterterm , while maintaining a nonzero mode for the long distance modes which can cancel the ir divergence .",
    "our focus in this paper is to analyze in detail how these 2-loop corrections affect the correlation functions .",
    "unsurprisingly , they are much more computationally difficult than the one - loop corrections , and so we will be unable to find closed form analytic results . however , many qualitative features can be extracted . in particular",
    ", we show that one loop corrections are indeed canceled by counterterms , while two - loop corrections produce a momentum dependent mass which is zero for the short distance modes .",
    "hence the long wavelength modes acquire a dynamical mass , while the short wavelength modes remain massless , as expected .    to see this effect , which is nonperturbative , we will need to resum the two loop corrections . technically , we resum a subset of the two - loop diagrams which are expected to produce the leading infrared divergences .",
    "this resummation will be found to produce a momentum dependent effective mass .",
    "the scaling of the masses turns out to be very different from previous calculations in the literature .",
    "as we shall discuss below , the difference between our results and the results in the literature appears to hinge on a different definition of the term massless scalar ( most importantly , reference @xcite employs techniques extremely similar to this paper , but with a different definition of the massless limit ) . to define what we mean by this term , we use the general feature that the de sitter propagator , on scales smaller than the hubble scale , should locally resemble a minkowski space propagator . in our definition ,",
    "a massless field is one which for shorter length scales ( i.e. distances parametrically smaller than the hubble scale ) has a propagator similar to a massless minkowski space propagator .",
    "this is not the only possible choice ( reflecting the difference with other definitions in the literature ) , but is a well defined one .",
    "the more naive definition would have been that the propagator should approach the propagator for a massless field at low momenta , but this appears to run into divergences .",
    "we begin by reviewing the in - in formalism for @xmath0 theory . this section deals with the free field .",
    "these rules have already been derived and presented elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) ; we refer the interested reader to these papers for further details .",
    "we will take the metric of de sitter space to be ds^2=1h^2 ^ 2(d^2-_i=1 ^ 3dx_i^2 )    we will also consider a scalar field propagating in this geometry ; the field will have mass @xmath3 and a quartic interaction .",
    "the lagrangian is then ( ) =    we note that we will be focusing on very light fields . to leading order ,",
    "therefore , we will set @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , we will have to work in the in - in formalism . in this formalism",

    "there are several limits of the free field @xmath7-propagator that are of interest .",
    "the first is the zero mass limit . for zero mass ,",
    "we have f^(0)_m^2=0(k,_1,_2)= h^22k^3[(1+k^2_1_2)(k(_1-_2 ) ) + k(_1-_2)(k(_1-_2 ) ) ]   + g^r(0)_m^2=0(k,_1,_2)= ( _ 1-_2)h^2k^3 [ ( 1+k^2_1_2)(k(_1-_2 ) ) -k(_1-_2)(k(_1-_2 ) ) ]    for small @xmath13 the keldysh propagator goes as @xmath14 f^(0)_m^2=0(k,_1,_2)~h^22k^3   this leads to divergences in loop diagrams . for finite masses , the low momentum behavior of the propagator is expressible in terms of @xmath15 and is found to be f^(0)_m^2(k,_1,_2)~h^22k^3(k^2_1_2)^ which regulates the infrared divergences found at @xmath4 .",
    "we first briefly consider the one - loop corrections to the massless theory .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown below .",
    "the third and fourth diagrams represent counterterms .",

    "the massless theory therefore does not seem to have a good perturbation expansion .",
    "however , the infinite correction can be canceled by a suitable choice of the counterterms .",
    "since the loop diagram is independent of external momenta , canceling the mass at high energies also cancels the mass at zero momentum .",
    "this will again result in a massless zero mode which will lead to ir divergences .",
    "we must therefore go beyond one loop to see whether the divergences can be resolved .",
    "the two loop correction has the generic form of a sunrise diagram .",
    "there are in fact three separate two - loop corrections which occur in this theory , which we denote @xmath18 .",

    "these diagrams are difficult to compute exactly .",
    "we are , however , interested in the most divergent pieces of these diagrams ; this will allow us to make several approximations to obtain an estimate of these loop corrections .",
    "we will focus on @xmath25 at the beginning , and apply the same approximations to the other integrals afterward .",
    "we first note that the ir divergences primarily come from regions of the loop integral where one of the @xmath7 propagators has a small momentum flowing through it",
    ". indeed , if we were to replace @xmath7 by @xmath26 in the above integrals , they would all be infrared divergent because @xmath27 .",
    "this ir divergence is presumably regulated when the full @xmath7 propagator is used .",
    "we therefore conclude that the low momentum behavior of the full @xmath7 propagator is significantly different from the tree level propagator @xmath28 .",
    "this modification by the higher order corrections will moderate the infrared behavior and make the integrals finite .",
    "now , although the @xmath7 propagator is modified in such a way that the integrals are finite , the divergences must reappear if we take the interaction @xmath29 .",
    "it must therefore be the case that we get a large contribution ( i.e. parametrically larger as a function of @xmath30 ) from the region of integration where the momenta flowing through an @xmath7 propagator is small .",
    "this further indicates that we can keep only the terms with the largest number of @xmath7 propagators , which are expected to have the largest contributions .    on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath31 propagator does not have infrared divergences when the momentum flowing through it is small .",
    "this means that there is no requirement for the corrections to modify it significantly at low momenta .",
    "we will assume the corrections to @xmath31 are small ( i.e. suppressed by powers of @xmath30 ) which will be confirmed by later calculations .",
    "we will therefore ( to leading order ) replace @xmath31 by @xmath32 in the above expressions .",
    "furthermore , the integration over momenta is expected to be dominated by the regions when both @xmath7 propagators have small momenta in their arguments . in particular",
    ", we would expect the dominant part of the integral for @xmath25 to come from the integration region where both internal momenta @xmath33 are much smaller than the external momentum @xmath13 i.e. @xmath34 . the integral then simplifies to _ 1(k,_1,_2)ia^4(_1)a^4(_2)g^r(0)(k,_1,_2)^2 where we have defined c(k,_1,_2)=",

    "it would be interesting to examine the effects of these diagrams ; we shall leave this for future work .    summarizing our results so far",

    "2(k)(k,_1,_2)+f_-m_1 ^ 2(k)(k,_1,_2 ) ) [ highmomentumf]where @xmath37 is the leading term in the integral ( [ highmomentummass ] ) .",
    "note that this is _ not _ the propagator for a massive field .",
    "unfortunately , our result above can not hold for all external momenta . for if it did , ( [ highmomentumf ] ) would be the exact solution for the propagator .",
    "but now the term in the propagator @xmath41 grows in the infrared even faster than @xmath42 . from ( [ highmomentummass ] ) , we would find @xmath37 to be divergent .",
    "this implies that the solution is not self consistent .",
    "one possibility that there is simply no solution ; that there is a deep inconsistency that does not allow a propagator to exist when the one - loop corrections are canceled by the counterterms .",
    "while this possibility can not be neglected , it would be surprising , for the reasons outlined in the introduction .",
    "we therefore conclude that some other corrections must become relevant at low momentum .",
    "the consequence is that there must be a crossover momentum @xmath43 below which our solution ( [ highmomentumf ] ) breaks down .",
    "we can trace this breakdown back to the original simplifications we made for the integral .",
    "we found that the leading contribution to @xmath25 was _",

    "the integral was found to be proportional to @xmath44 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath35 was the integral of @xmath45 up to momentum @xmath13 .",
    "but for small external momenta @xmath13 , the last factor necessarily goes to zero .",
    "it therefore can not be dominant for small external momenta .",
    "once again we are led to the existence of a crossover momentum @xmath43 below which the solution ( [ highmomentumf ] ) is not valid .    on the other hand , for larger momenta ( @xmath13 above @xmath43 ) , our resummation in the previous section is still valid .",
    "we then expect the form of the propagator at these momenta to be of the form ( [ highmomentumf ] ) .    for external momenta which are smaller than @xmath43 , we can approximate the integral for @xmath25 by its value at @xmath46 : _ 1(k,_1,_2)i^2a^4(_1)a^4(_2)_k_1,k_2=0^ d^3k_1 d^3k_2 f(k_1,_1,_2)f(k_2,_1,_2)g^r(-k_1-k_2,_1,_2 ) [ lowmomentummass ] this is independent of @xmath13 , and hence produces a correction that is dominant for low momenta .",
    "these corrections will therefore produce an effect similar to a dynamical mass , and in particular , they will cut off the infrared divergences .",
    "the time dependence is more complicated than a simple mass insertion , and so we therefore make the ansatz f(k,_1,_2)= \\ {    c 12(f_m_1 ^ 2(k)(k,_1,_2)+f_-m_1 ^ 2(k)(k,_1,_2 ) ) k > k_0 + f(_1,_2)h^22k^3(k^2)^ k < k_0    .

    "our conclusion for the low momentum modes is then that their propagation is modified in a manner similar to a dynamical mass .",
    "this dynamical mass has a scaling proportional to @xmath58 and cuts off the infrared divergences .",
    "we have discussed how a quartic interaction would modify the propagator of a massless field in de sitter space .",
    "we have found a complicated result ; there is a crossover momentum scale with very different behavior of the propagator above and below the crossover . for long wavelengths ,",
    "the modes behave as if they develop a dynamical mass . for shorter wavelengths , surprisingly , the propagator is the sum of a massive propagator and a propagator for a tachyonic field .",
    "our main result is encapsulated in equation ( [ finalresult ] ) , which is our result for the keldysh propagator once interactions are included .    the apparently surprising behavior at shorter momenta has a natural explanation from the masslessness of the scalar .",

    "the high momentum modes in our calculation do not obtain a mass correction .",
    "note that the tachyonic piece was necessary for this to happen .",
    "the behavior for longer wavelengths is more in line with expectations .",
    "we have found that momenta with longer wavelengths behave as if they have a mass , which is similar to results in the literature .",
    "quantitatively , however , our results are different ; we have found a dynamical mass which scales as @xmath58 rather than the usual scaling of @xmath61 found by previous authors .",
    "this is because the mass in our case is generated at two loops rather than one - loop .",
    "further corrections to the propagator and other correlation functions can be calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "infrared divergences are now absent and so the perturbation expansion should make sense .",
    "we note that any loop involving an @xmath7 propagator is enhanced by a factor @xmath62 .",
    "this indicates that the perturbation expansion is in powers of @xmath58 rather than @xmath30 .",
    "there are several open issues that still need to be addressed .",
    "in particular , we have argued for a crossover momentum , but we have not found its magnitude ( even as a scaling in @xmath30 ) . a calculation to next order in perturbation theory might shed light on this issue .",
