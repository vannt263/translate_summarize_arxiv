    "damped ly@xmath0  systems ( dlas ) are the neutral gas reservoirs at high redshift that have , by definition , neutral hydrogen column densities in excess of @xmath14 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "at these high column densities the gas is self - shielded ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in a simple ionization structure which facilitates the derivation of element abundances .",
    "moreover , the abundances thus derived are independent of the geometrical configuration and thermodynamical state of the gas , and of most other factors which complicate the analysis of stellar spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the largest uncertainties in dla abundance studies are due to the effects of line saturation and dust depletion ( for some elements ) , although the latter of these concerns is found to be minimal when the metallicity of the dla is below @xmath15 @xcite .    in recent years , these very metal - poor ( vmp ) dlas , with metallicities [ fe / h ] } \\equiv \\log(n_{\\rm a}/n_{\\rm b } ) - \\log(n_{\\rm a}/n_{\\rm b})_{\\odot}$ ] where @xmath16 refers to the number of atoms of element a , b.]@xmath17 , have attracted an increasing amount of interest because of their potential for probing gas which may still bear the chemical imprint of the first few generations of stars to have formed in the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they are thus an extremely valuable complement , at high redshifts , to local studies of the oldest and most metal - poor stars in the galactic halo .",
    "the vmp dla regime was largely unexplored until very recently , when it became possible to identify candidate metal - poor dlas in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasars , and then measure their chemical composition with high resolution follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "the first high spectral resolution ( r@xmath18 , fwhm@xmath19 ) sample of vmp dlas was compiled by @xcite , whose main goal was to compare the relative abundances of c , n , and o with the trends observed in vmp halo stars in our galaxy .",
    "more recently , @xcite have presented medium resolution ( fwhm @xmath20 ) spectroscopy of a sample of 27 vmp dlas to explore the general properties of dlas in the vmp regime . however , as penprase et al .",
    "acknowledge themselves , there are difficulties with accurately measuring column densities from medium ( as opposed to high ) resolution data , given that most dlas with metallicities less than 1/100 solar exhibit very low velocity dispersions , with metal line widths less than 10 km  s@xmath21 @xcite . under these circumstances , line saturation can easily be overlooked .",
    "perhaps the most startling result from abundance studies of vmp dlas are the near - solar values of [ c / o ] at low metallicity @xcite , in line with the peculiar upturn in the [ c / o ] abundance below [ o / h]@xmath22 in galactic halo stars discovered by @xcite and later confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite attributed this behaviour to an increased c yield from earlier generations of massive stars .",
    "@xcite extended this work and reported a number of dlas with supersolar [ c / o ] suggesting that this ratio continues to increase with decreasing [ o / h ] . a more recent compilation of high spectral resolution observations of vmp dlas , however , suggests that the ratio in fact plateaus at @xmath23}\\sim -0.2 $ ] @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the relatively new interest in vmp dlas , studies of metal - poor galactic halo stars have received ongoing attention for more than two decades , most recently from the dedicated hk @xcite and he s @xcite surveys .",
    "a relevant result emerging from this work is that nearly one - quarter of all metal - poor stars with [ fe / h]@xmath24 exhibit a marked carbon enhancement , with [ c / fe]@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these are collectively known as carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars ( cemp stars ) , and have been subdivided into four classes based on the abundances of their neutron - capture elements : ( i & ii ) the cemp - s and cemp - r classes , with enhancements of elements produced predominantly by the @xmath25-process and @xmath26-process respectively ; ( iii ) the cemp - rs class , with enhancements in both the @xmath25- and @xmath26-process elements ; and ( iv ) the cemp - no class , which exhibits no such enhancements . for further details of these classes , and the likely origins of their carbon enhancements , we direct the reader to @xcite . in short",
    ", there is reasonable evidence to suggest that cemp - s and cemp - rs stars are extrinsically polluted by a now extinct asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) companion .",
    "the origin of the cemp - no class , however , is not yet firmly established .",
    "whilst several models invoking mass transfer from an agb companion could explain the lack of neutron - capture elements ( e.g. @xcite ) , radial - velocity measurements have not yet confirmed whether cemp - no stars are host to binary companions . indeed , the apparent difference in the metallicity distributions between cemp - no stars and the other cemp classes , in the sense that cemp - no stars are more numerous at lower metallicity , might suggest that a mechanism other than the agb binary transfer scenario produces the c enhancement in cemp - no stars @xcite . in all likelihood , as pointed out by @xcite , there is a continuous link that connects _ some _ cemp - no stars with cemp - s stars , while the carbon enhancement of other cemp - no stars may have a different origin .",
    "models of core - collapse supernova yields from population  iii ( or near metal - free ) stars do entertain high c yields relative to fe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "population iii enrichment is a particularly intriguing explanation for the origin of the carbon enhancement in some cemp stars , since the three most fe - poor halo stars all exhibit carbon enhancements relative to iron @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fraction of metal - poor stars that exhibit a carbon - enhancement _ increases _ with decreasing metallicity @xcite . in this population iii enrichment scenario , the carbon enhancement in the extremely metal - poor regime reflects the initial composition of the gas from which these stars formed , rather than resulting from mass transfer from an evolved companion .    whilst the physics behind core - collapse supernovae",
    "is poorly constrained , several parameterised models have been developed to calculate the expected yields from zero - metallicity progenitors to compare with the observations of the most fe - poor cemp stars , as well as the more ` normal ' non - cemp stars .",
    "the most important ( and largely unknown ) quantities are the degree of mixing during the supernova explosion and the amount of fallback onto the remnant black hole thereafter @xcite .",
    "@xcite parameterised both quantaties , then suitably selected the appropriate values that reproduce the observed stellar abundance patterns .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , parameterise only the mixing parameter by applying a running boxcar filter over the star following the explosion .",
    "this prescription successfully reproduces the chemical composition of the extremely metal - poor ( non - cemp ) halo stars from the study by @xcite , as well as that of the most fe - poor cemp stars he0107@xmath25240 @xcite and he1327@xmath22326 @xcite .",
    "@xcite extended this work by mapping the one - dimensional models by @xcite onto a two - dimensional grid to follow rayleigh - taylor induced mixing after explosive nuclear burning .",
    "whilst the @xcite models are physically motivated , they are unable to reproduce the relatively high levels of nitrogen enrichment that are observed in the most fe - poor stars , nor are they able to produce sufficient fe - peak elements .    these concerns are alleviated with models that include rotation ( e.g. @xcite ) , since rotation induces additional mixing and mass loss in the pre - supernova phase of low - metallicity stars .",
    "the only simulation available to date that investigates the effects of both rotational and rayleigh - taylor mixing , as well as incorporating a realistic prescription of fallback , are those presented recently by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . by introducing rotation in their zero - metallicity models , @xcite report an increased nitrogen yield , as well as an increased fe - peak element yield ,",
    "however , these models are not able to reproduce the high cno to fe ratios observed in the most metal - poor stars . in summary",
    ", it is still a matter of some debate whether these extremely metal - poor early population  ii stars : ( i ) were borne out of gas which had previously been carbon - enriched by the first stars ; or ( ii ) received a cno top - up from a companion star ; and/or ( iii ) exhibit a degree of self - pollution from their own nucleosynthesis .    the first possibility , that at least some cemp stars were borne out of carbon - enhanced gas , is given additional support from the discovery reported here of an extremely metal - poor dla at @xmath1 exhibiting a carbon enhancement akin to that measured in galactic cemp stars .",
    "no other case was known until now , given ( i ) the rarity of dlas with [ fe / h]@xmath27 , which lie in the tail of the metallicity distribution of dlas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( ii ) the difficulty in measuring [ c / h ] in dlas , where the relevant absorption lines are often saturated even in the vmp regime .",
    "we speculate that this dla may be the ` missing link ' between the first few generations of stars and some of the cemp stars in the galactic halo .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 summarizes the observations and data reduction .",
    "we analyse the absorption lines in the damped ly@xmath0  system and deduce corresponding element abundances in section  3 . in section 4",
    "we scrutinize potential issues that could masquerade as a carbon enhancement .",
    "after ruling out these possibilities , we discuss in section  5 possible origins of this enhancement , and consider the implications of our finding for models of cemp stars .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and draw our conclusions in section  6 .",
    "the @xmath28 , @xmath29 qso j0035@xmath20918 was selected for our on - going survey for vmp dlas @xcite on the basis of its sdss spectrum which shows a dla at @xmath30 with no apparent associated metal lines .",
    "such cases are highly suggestive of narrow and weak metal absorption lines which are undetectable at the coarse resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the discovery sdss spectra .",
    "follow - up observations of j0035@xmath20918 were made with the magellan echellette ( mage ) spectrograph @xcite on the magellan  ii clay telescope on the nights of 2008 december 30 and 31 in good conditions with 1arcsec seeing .",
    "we took @xmath31s exposures using the standard setup with 1@xmath321 binning and a 1.0arcsec slit giving a resolving power @xmath33 .",
    "standard calibrations were taken following the recommendations by simcoe , hennawi &   williams .",
    "the data were reduced using a custom set of idl routines written by g.  d.  becker and described in @xcite . the mage spectrum confirmed the vmp dla nature of the @xmath34 absorption system , by showing clear damping wings to the ly@xmath0  absorption line ( see top panel of figure  [ fig : dla ] ) and unusually weak associated metal lines .    encouraged by these initial indications , we subsequently observed j0035@xmath20918 on the night of 2009 december 9 with the high resolution echelle spectrograph @xcite on the keck  i telescope under good conditions with sub - arcsecond seeing , for a total integration time of 16200s , divided into 6 exposures of 2700s , resulting in a signal - to - noise ratio near 4500   of @xmath35 .",

    "the hires spectra were reduced with the makee data reduction pipeline developed by tom barlow , which performs the usual steps of flat - fielding , order tracing , background subtraction , and extraction of the final 1-d spectrum .",
    "the data were wavelength calibrated by reference to the spectrum of a thar lamp , and mapped onto a vacuum heliocentric wavelength scale .",
    "the extracted spectra were merged and then normalized by dividing out the qso continuum and emission lines , using the software package uves popler , maintained by michael murphymmurphy / uves_popler ] . following this step ,",
    "all available metal absorption lines associated with the dla were extracted in @xmath43 km  s@xmath21 windows around the pixel with highest optical depth . a further fine correction to the continuum",

    "the latter were determined by shifting the continuum by @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the @xmath46 error spectrum , and @xmath10 is the number of independent resolution elements over which the equivalent width integration was carried out ) , and recalculating the equivalent width . for the undetected transitions , we quote the @xmath47 limiting rest - frame equivalent width , using as a guide the profile of the weakest absorption line , feii  @xmath48 , which we detect at the @xmath49 confidence limit ( see table  [ tab : lines ] ) .",

[ fig : abund_plot ] is the overabundance of carbon relative to all other elements .",
    "thus , for example , [ c / o]@xmath66 , which implies an overabundance of carbon relative to oxygen by a factor of @xmath67 ; similarly , [ c / fe]@xmath68 , or @xmath69 times solar ! given such extreme values ,",
    "it is important to consider what factors , if any , may have led us to spuriously overestimate the abundance of carbon . to this end",
    ", we performed several tests , which we now discuss .",
    "the upshot of these tests is that we could not find any plausible reason why the abundance of carbon would have been significantly overestimated .",
    "thus , readers who are less interested in the details of these checks may skip the rest of this section and move straight to the discussion in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "first we considered the possibility that the background may have been oversubtracted in the proximity of the cii absorption lines ; if the zero level had been incorrectly determined , this may lead us to overestimate the apparent optical depth of the absorption . while we can not categorically rule out this possibility , as we do not have any independent measures of the zero level ( such as saturated absorption lines with flat cores ) in the immediate vicinity of the cii lines , we note the following : ( i ) there are a number of strongly saturated ly@xmath0  absorption lines in the ly@xmath0  forest ( shortwards of @xmath70 ) and none of them show a systematic offset of their cores from zero residual intensity ; ( ii ) the apparent optical depths of the _ two _ cii transitions covered by our hires spectrum , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are mutually consistent ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dla ] ) ; thus , if the background level were incorrect , it would have to have been oversubtracted by the same fractional amount of the qso continuum at these two wavelengths , separated by 995   in the observed spectrum ( at @xmath1 ) .",
    "we also inspected the raw 2-d hires frames in the region of the two best observed cii and oi lines , @xmath71 and @xmath73 and found that they both fall close to the peak of the echelle blaze function , near the centre of the hires detector , where the data are of the highest s / n .",
    "we conclude that the recorded excess of c is unlikely to be an artifact of the data reduction process .",
    "next we looked critically at the profile fitting procedure .",
    "our vpfit modelling described in section  [ sec : col_dens ] assumed that the neutrals and singly ionized species arise from gas with the same doppler parameter .",
    "we relaxed this constraint by fitting separately the absorption lines of the first ions ( two cii , five siii lines and one line each of alii and feii ) and the neutrals ( five oi and two ni lines ) . in this case , vpfit converged to best fitting doppler parameters of @xmath74 for the first ions and @xmath75 for the neutrals . with these parameters",
    "the cii  column density is _ higher _ by 0.1dex than the value listed in table  [ tab : cd ] ( that is , the value obtained by tying @xmath76 to be the same for all species ) , while @xmath77(oi ) is _ lower _ by 0.1dex .",
    "the column densities of other elements remain essentially unchanged . in other words ,",
    "kinematically decoupling neutrals and first ions has the net effect of further _ increasing _ the [ c / o ] overabundance relative to the values in table  [ tab : abund ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : abund_plot ] . note also that the above values of @xmath76 are still consistent within the errors with the best - fitting @xmath78 deduced in section  [ sec : col_dens ] by tying all the absorption lines together . finally , fitting _ only _ the cii  lines , without reference to any other transition , yielded @xmath79 = 15.42 \\pm 0.59 $ ] , which is only 0.05dex lower than the value listed in table  [ tab : cd ] , albeit with a larger error ( but with much the same redshift and doppler parameter : @xmath80 and @xmath81 km  s@xmath21 ) .",
    "in order to compare theoretical and observed absorption line profiles , vpfit requires knowledge of the instrumental broadening function , normally assumed to be a gaussian with fwhm corresponding to the spectral resolution .",
    "the nominal resolution of spectra recorded through the @xmath36arcsec wide entrance slit of hires employed in our observations is fwhm@xmath82 km  s@xmath21 ( see http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/hires/ ) , but this applies to a uniformly illuminated slit . since the seeing was consistently better than @xmath36arcsec during our observations of j0035@xmath20918 , it is likely that the actual resolution of our data is somewhat better than the nominal value .",
    "the narrowest features in the spectrum of j0035@xmath20918 are the metal absorption lines of the @xmath1 dla themselves .",
    "we therefore estimated the true spectral resolution  measured by the doppler parameter @xmath83fwhm  by varying @xmath84 in small steps from 5.0 to 3.7 km  s@xmath21 ( i.e. between fwhm@xmath85 and 6.2 km  s@xmath21 ) , fitting all of the absorption lines",
    "as described in section  [ sec : col_dens ] , and minimizing the @xmath86 between the model and observed profiles as a function of @xmath84 .",
    "this procedure gave a well - defined @xmath87 km  s@xmath21 , corresponding to fwhm=7.3 km  s@xmath21 , or @xmath88 , which is the value used in all the profile fitting described in sections  [ sec : col_dens ] and [ sec : gas_kinem ] .",
    "it is obviously important to test the sensitivity of our results to the value of @xmath84 adopted . within the range of values tested , @xmath893.7 km  s@xmath21 , the column density of cii  and the corresponding element ratios changed by no more than @xmath90dex compared to the values in table  [ tab : cd ] which refer to the case @xmath87 km  s@xmath21 .",
    "on the basis of the tests carried out in this and the preceding subsection , we conclude that the overabundance of carbon is not an artifact of the profile fitting analysis of the absorption lines .",
    "the @xmath65 dla in j0035@xmath20918 is unique so far in showing such a marked overabundance of carbon .",

    ".         it may be surprising to some to see what subtle changes in the line profiles result from changing @xmath77(cii ) by a factor of @xmath67 .",
    "the reason is that the two cii absorption lines are close to saturation and , as they approach the flat part of the curve of growth , their equivalent widths only increase slowly with rising column density . in the present case , the curve of growth for the metal lines in the @xmath1 dla towards j0035@xmath20918 ( reproduced in fig .  [ fig : cog ] ) is well - constrained by the relative strengths of six oi  and five siiitransitions of widely differing @xmath99-values ( see table  [ tab : lines ] ) . since the column densities of both oi  and feii  are fixed by optically thin transitions ( i.e. independent of the doppler parameter ) , the ratios [ c / o ] and [ c / fe ] depend only on the cii  column density . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cog ] , we compare the measured equivalent width of cii@xmath71 ( indicated by the blue hatched region ) with the values expected if [ c / o]=0.0 ( red ) , [ c / fe]=+1.0 ( blue ) , and [ c / fe]=+1.53 ( green ) . only in this last case ( [ c / fe]=+1.53 )",

    "figures  [ fig : co_solar ] and [ fig : cog ] offer a clearer view of the carbon - enhanced nature of this dla , while at the same time highlighting the subtle differences in the absorption line profiles when lines are on the flat part of the curve of growth .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to question whether the differences between the line profiles computed with [ c / o]=0.0 and the observed profiles , most evident for cii@xmath71 in the bottom right - hand set of panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : co_solar ] , may be simply due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "we tested this possibility with a monte carlo - type approach .",
    "we synthesized 100 pairs of cii@xmath72 , @xmath1011334 line profiles , all corresponding to [ c / o]@xmath102 and with the best fitting doppler parameter ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we perturbed these line profiles with gaussian distributed errors from the observed @xmath103 error spectrum , and then used vpfit to fit each of these 100 pairs of cii  lines ( together with the observed line profiles of the other ions ) and deduce 100 new values of @xmath77(cii ) . using the simultaneously derived oi  column density (",
    "which is essentially unchanged since it is constrained by weaker transitions ) , we calculated the [ c / o ] ratio for all of our realizations to determine how often one would expect to observe [ c / o ] @xmath104 if the true [ c / o ] ratio were solar .",

    ", none of the tests we have performed can explain away the c overabundance we have uncovered .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the data is that we have identified a damped ly@xmath0  system with a marked overabundance of c , comparable to that so far found only in carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars of the milky way .",
    "as already mentioned , this is the first example of a dla meeting the conventional definition of cemp stars , [ c / fe]@xmath6 . while it is the only such case in the survey by @xcite , which includes a dozen dlas with [ fe / h]@xmath27 , it is nevertheless very hard to draw conclusions regarding the frequency of cemp dlas .",
    "the reason stems from the difficulties associated with measuring the cii  column density ; the cii@xmath72 and @xmath71 absorption lines are almost always saturated in damped ly@xmath0  absorption systems , even at low metallicities .",

    "rather , what we presumably see in the dla is the initial chemical composition of the gas from which cemp stars would subsequently form . in this case , the pattern of element abundances revealed gives strong clues to the nature of the earlier generation of stars ( and supernovae ) which seeded the dla cloud with its metals .",
    "we explore these ideas further by comparing the abundance pattern of the dla with those of halo stars of similar metallicity and with calculations of element yields from metal - free and metal - poor stars . in this endeavour , we are limited by the small number of elements whose abundances we have been able to measure , but this is an inevitable consequence of the low metallicity of this dla . while it would be instructive to know the abundances of other fe - peak elements , such as cr and zn for example , the absorption lines of these species would require s / n@xmath110 for @xmath49 detections ! = [ zn / fe ] = 0.0 . ] realistically , only mg and s are within reach of dedicated future observations , and there is certainly no hope of measuring directly the abundances of neutron capture elements in the dla .      in order to compare the relative abundances of the elements measured in the dla with the corresponding values in galactic halo stars , we median - combined the abundances of all cemp stars with fe / h within a factor of two of the dla ( @xmath111}\\le-2.74 $ ] ) from the recent compilation of @xcite .",

    "is shown together with that of the ` average ' population of all cemp stars ( open magenta boxes ) , while in the middle panel the comparison is restricted to cemp - no stars .",
    "clearly cemp stars , of both flavours , are a heterogeneous population , exhibiting wide ranges in the ratios of the elements considered here . on the basis of the limited evidence available , it appears that the c / fe ratio in our dla is a better match to the values seen in the subset of cemp - no stars than to the more extreme values encountered in some cemp stars .",
    "other elements ratios are less straightforward to interpret .",
    "nitrogen , for example , is evidently less abundant in the dla compared to cemp stars by @xmath117 orders of magnitude !",
    "however , it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from this discrepancy , because the abundance of n is notoriously difficult to measure in metal - poor stars where it relies on the analysis of molecular bands of nh or cn , each with its own disadvantages ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the largest uncertainty arises from the assumed 1d ( rather than 3d ) model atmospheres ; correcting for 3d effects can change then deduced values of n / h by @xmath118 dex ( note that similar corrections also apply to c / h when derived from molecular bands of ch or c@xmath119 ; @xcite ) . furthermore , the photospheric n / h we measure today is unlikely to reflect the n abundance of the gas cloud that gave birth to the star ; during the star s evolution it will become self - polluted by its own nucleosynthesis ( e.g. through cn cycling or rotational mixing ) , which is likely emphasised by the high seed c abundance .",
    "thus , a comparison between stellar and dla nitrogen abundances is not very instructive .",
    "comparing the oxygen abundances in cemp stars and the dla is similarly problematic .",
    "the statistics are very poor ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : abund_plot_mpstars ] ) and it is well known that different spectral features used to deduce o / h in the metal - poor regime give discordant answers @xcite .",
    "significant departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) become important when measuring the o abundance from the infrared triplet at @xmath120 nm in the metal - poor regime ( [ fe / h]@xmath121 ) , leading to non - lte corrections of the order of @xmath122 to @xmath123 dex @xcite . similarly , the oxygen abundance determined from the uv oh lines is subject to large 3d corrections of up to @xmath124 dex when [ fe / h]@xmath125 @xcite .",
    "clearly , it will be important to reexamine this issue once samples of cemp stars have grown to include more cases where [ o / fe ] has been measured with confidence .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : abund_plot_mpstars ] demonstrates that there is a reasonably good match between cemp stars and the dla in the elements al and si , particularly for the cemp - no stars . in this context , we point out that significant ( positive ) non - lte corrections to al / h may apply for stars in this metallicity regime ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to address this issue , we first identified those cemp stars in the @xcite compilation whose al abundances were derived assuming lte .",
    "we then applied non - lte corrections to al based on the @xcite estimates , which amounted to a typical correction of the order of @xmath126 .",
    "the al abundances for the ` typical ' cemp and cemp - no star presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : abund_plot_mpstars ] should thus correspond to the ( approximate ) non - lte values .    finally , in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : abund_plot_mpstars ] we compare the element ratios ( relative to fe ) in the dla with the values measured for two cemp stars selected from the compilation by @xcite because they most closely match the relative abundances in the dla .",
    "it is certainly plausible that stars forming out of this dla gas would share many chemical similarities  at least for the elements considered here  with these two stars of the milky way galactic halo .      with a metallicity [ fe / h ] of only 1/1000 solar ,",
    "it is conceivable that the chemical composition of the dla gas reflects the element yields of only a few prior generations of stars .",
    "it is thus of interest to compare the abundance pattern in fig .",
    "[ fig : abund_plot ] with calculations of nucleosynthesis by metal - free , or low metallicity , stars .",
    "calculations of yields from metal - free stars ( commonly referred to as popiii stars ) , aimed in particular at interpreting the element ratios seen in very metal - poor stars , have focused on models which include ` mixing and fallback ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these scenarios involve core - collapse supernovae where the elements synthesized in the inner regions of the star are mixed by some process ( several possibilities have been put forward ) ; a fraction of the mixed material subsequently falls back onto the central remnant while the rest is ejected into interstellar space .",
    "such models are illustrative , rather than predictive , since the parameters describing the boundaries of the mixing region and the fraction of the mixed material which is ejected can not be derived from first principles , and are instead parameterised and suitably adjusted to fit the observed stellar abundances ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a string of recent models that employ a more physically motivated prescription of fallback @xcite , have also investigated the effects of mixing due to the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite together with rotationally induced mixing in 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite . by and large , a general feature of these models",
    "is that an abundance pattern similar to that found here in the dla , including the carbon enhancement and the marked odd - even effect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : abund_plot ] ) , can be reproduced with low energy explosions , such as those giving rise to the faint sn branch ( see fig .  1 of @xcite , and fig .  11 of @xcite ) , and a moderate degree of mixing and fallback .",
    "for example , in the mixing - fallback model considered by @xcite , enrichment with the elements ejected by a single @xmath127 star of zero metallicity , exploding as a core - collapse supernova with an energy @xmath128ergs , provides a remarkably good fit to the relative element abundances measured in the dla ( kobayashi et al . in prep ) .",
    "it remains to be established whether a zero initial metallicity ( i.e. pop  iii ) is actually required to match the observations , or whether a similar abundance pattern could also be reproduced by models with low , but non - zero , initial metallicity .",
    "an alternative to the mixing and fallback model has been proposed by the geneva group whose work places more emphasis on the effects of rotation to provide the mixing and the trigger for mass loss in very metal - poor stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . whilst these models are physically well - motivated , the rather high nitrogen yield predicted by some models contrasts with the relatively low [ n / c ] and [ n / o ] observed in this dla .",
    "this may in turn place interesting contraints on the rotation velocities of the metal - free stars that may have seeded the dla with its metals .",
    "only recently has rotation been included in zero - metallicity progenitors under the mixing - fallback scenario @xcite .",
    "it should be possible to assess better the effects of rotation on the yield from zero - metallicity progenitors as these stellar models improve and as the samples of cemp dlas grow .",
    "it is truly intriguing that an _",
    "entire _ cloud of neutral gas is so highly enhanced in carbon and shows such a clear - cut odd - even effect , if both are indeed characteristic of pop  iii supernova yields . in this context , it is of interest to estimate the mass of carbon involved . with the assumption of spherical symmetry ,",
    "the mass of singly ionized carbon in the dla is given by : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath10(h ) is the volume density ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the corresponding mass of neutral gas in the dla is : @xmath131    since c is mostly singly - ionized in dlas , eq .",
    "( 4 ) implies an upper limit of @xmath132 to the total mass of @xmath7c in the dla .",
    "however , the inverse square dependence of @xmath133(cii ) on the gas density allows substantially lower values of @xmath133(cii ) . in section  [ sec : ion_corr ] it was shown that our lower limit @xmath134@xmath12 was based on the non - detection of nii absorption , and that higher densities are likely given the very low velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "if , for example , @xmath135@xmath12 , which would imply a linear extent of the dla of 100pc along the line of sight , then the implied mass of @xmath7c would be reduced to only @xmath136 . for comparison ,",
    "the total mass of @xmath7c ejected by the single @xmath127 pop  iii star in the model by @xcite is @xmath137 .",
    "the models by @xcite anticipate a similar ejected mass of @xmath7c ( @xmath138 ) for a comparable explosion energy and progenitor mass .",
    "thus , we may indeed be seeing the elements synthesized by only a few supernovae in the chemical enrichment of the dla considered here .    in conclusion , we speculate that the @xmath34 dla in front of the qso j0035@xmath20918 may well be the much sought ` missing link ' between the first , zero - metallicity , stars and the most metal - poor stars in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "its low metallicity of 1/1000 solar in fe , coupled with an overabundance of c and a marked odd - even effect in the relative abundances of the few elements that could be measured , are all consistent with the yields produced by models of pop  iii stars which explode as core - collapse supernovae of relatively low energy .",
    "the mass of newly synthesized elements may be that produced by only a few such supernovae , depending on the unknown volume density of the gas in the dla . in this scenario , the gas we see as a damped ly@xmath0  system at high redshift may be the material from which a subsequent generation of stars formed , with a chemical composition similar to that seen in cemp - no stars of the galactic halo .",
    "in the course of our program to study the most metal - poor dlas and , in particular , to measure the abundances of the cno group of elements , we have uncovered a dla , at @xmath65 towards the @xmath29 sdss qso j0035@xmath20918 , whose chemical composition is consistent with that produced from exploding populationiii stars . from the analysis of medium and high resolution spectra of this dla we draw the following conclusions .",
    "( i ) the metal absorption lines associated with the dla are formed in quiescent gas , consisting of a single absorption component with a small doppler parameter @xmath139 .",
    "( ii ) the metallicity of the dla , as measured from fe , is very low : [ fe / h]@xmath140 , or @xmath141 solar .",
    "( iii ) the dla exhibits a strong enhancement of the abundance of carbon relative to all other metals covered by our data : n , o , al , si , s and fe . we measure [ c / fe]@xmath4 , a factor of @xmath5 greater than observed in any other dla up to now . adopting the defining criterion for carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars in the galactic halo , [ c / fe ] @xmath6 , this is the first example of an analogous carbon - enhanced dla .",
    "we also deduce [ c / o]@xmath66 , whereas in all other dlas with [ fe / h]@xmath142 studied up to now [ c / o]@xmath143 .",
    "( iv ) the dla also exhibits a clear odd - even effect , which implies a low neutron excess , and hence presumably low abundances of neutron - capture elements .",
    "when its chemical composition is compared with that of galactic carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars which do not exhibit an excess of neutron - capture elements , a good match is found for some element ratios ( c / fe , al / fe and si / fe ) .",
    "n and o are significantly less abundant , compared to fe , in the dla than in most cemp stars , but it is difficult to draw definite conclusions for these two elements which are notoriously difficult to measure in very metal - poor stars .",
    "( v ) the abundance pattern we observe for this dla is consistent with enrichment from a population of @xmath5@xmath144 metal - free , or extremely metal - poor , stars that ended their lives as core - collapse supernovae with modest explosion energies .",
    "we estimate the total mass of @xmath7c within the dla to be @xmath9 .",
    "this upper limit could be constrained further with higher signal - to - noise ratio spectra that would permit a measure of the column density of nii  and other successive ion stages whose ratios are density dependent .",
    "the steep dependence of @xmath133(@xmath7c ) on the gas density allows the possibility that we may be seeing the chemical enrichment produced by only a few prior supernovae .",
    "( vi ) we speculate that the gas in this dla may be the ` missing link ' between the yields of population  iii stars , and their later incorporation in the cemp - no class of carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars .",
    "we note , however , that the carbon - enhancement in some cemp - no stars could also be produced by other means .",
    "long term radial velocity monitoring of cemp - no stars will confirm or deny their association with a now extinct companion .",
    "the results presented here emphasise the importance of further observations of dlas with [ fe / h]@xmath145 to complement the work being carried out on the most metal - poor stars .",
    "such dlas may be the most suitable environments for measuring the true yields from zero- or low - metallicity stars , free from the complications of stellar abundance measurements and the possibility that these stars are polluted by an unseen binary companion , or self - polluted by their own nucleosynthesis .",
    "the extremely metal - poor regime for dlas is yet to be thoroughly explored with high - resolution and high signal - to - noise spectra  who knows what may lurk there !",
