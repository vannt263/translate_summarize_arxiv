    "bright x - ray sources such as supernova remnants ( snrs ) and binaries with a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole component are ` relics ' of massive stars and hence carry key information on the star formation history , dynamics , and structure of their host galaxy .",
    "however , our knowledge of the populations of bright x - ray sources in our galaxy is highly incomplete due to the galactic absorption in the low energy band , large angular size that must be observed , and limited information on the distance of the relevant objects .    the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , a satellite of our galaxy , is the next nearest neighbor after the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the proximity ( 60  kpc is assumed in this paper ; mathewson 1985 ) , reasonable angular size ( @xmath1 ) , and low interstellar absorption to the smc are all favorable for an unbiased survey of the x - ray source populations in the entire galaxy .",
    "surveys of soft x - ray sources ( below @xmath2  kev ) have been carried out with the einstein and rosat satellites .",
    "the most complete source catalogs are presented in wang & wu ( 1992 , hereafter ww92 ) and kahabka et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter k99 ) .",
    "k99 classified the sources detected by the rosat pspc ( position sensitive proportional counter ) , based on two different hardness ratios , together with spatial information .",
    "cowley et al . ( 1997 ) and schmidtke et al . ( 1999 ) made numerous observations of the smc with the rosat hri ( high resolution imager ) , and determined accurate positions of x - ray sources .",
    "optical observations made at ctio ( cerro tololo interamerican observatory ) showed that five of these x - ray sources have a massive star companion and hence are high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "bright x - ray sources can be classified by their spectral and temporal characteristics .",
    "x - rays from young snrs are either due to a shock heated plasma ( in shell - like snrs ) which preferentially emits soft ( below @xmath2  kev ) line - dominated x - rays , or due to the release of rotational energy from isolated nss ( x - ray pulsars associated with crab - like snrs ) with hard and featureless spectra . unlike snrs , the other classes of x - ray sources emit time - variable x - rays .",
    "nss with a low mass companion star ( low mass x - ray binaries : lmxbs ) have hard spectra and often exhibit x - ray bursts .",
    "black hole binaries ( bhs ) have bimodal behavior and show both high - soft and low - hard spectral states . nss with a high mass stellar companion ( hmxbs )",
    "have even harder x - ray spectra and often exhibit long - term flux variations of a factor @xmath3100 .",
    "many hmxbs also show coherent pulsations ( x - ray binary pulsars ; xbps ) .",
    "consequently , most bright x - ray sources emit copious hard x - rays ( above @xmath2 kev ) .",
    "however , due mainly to a lack of imaging capability in the hard x - ray band , no systematic survey of the populations of hard x - ray sources had previously been made .",
    "the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ; tanaka , inoue , & holt 1993 ) is equipped with wide - band x - ray imaging instruments and hence is optimized for an x - ray population study .    in this paper , we report the results from multiple observations on the smc with asca .",
    "the observation fields and the method of data reduction are presented in  [ sec : obs ] . in  [ sec : result ] , we extract x - ray sources detected above the 5-@xmath4 level from the observation fields , perform temporal and spectral analyses on all the sources , and categorize them into thermal snrs and xbps .

    "[ sec : dis ] , we propose a simple and reliable source classification method .",
    "we clearly distinguish between thermal snrs and xbps with this method , then discuss these x - ray source populations in the smc . finally , we summarize this study in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "asca had observed the smc 10 times by the end of 1998 and we have used the data from eight of these observations which are either in the public archive or came from our own proposed observations .",
    "observation dates , pointing directions and other relevant information are listed in table [ tab : obs ] . most of the optically bright portion and the eastern wing of the smc has been covered . in each observation , x - ray photons were collected with four xrts ( x - ray telescopes ) and detected separately with the two giss ( gas imaging spectrometers ) and the two siss ( solid - state imaging spectrometers ) .",
    "details of these instruments are presented separately in serlemitsos et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , ohashi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and burke et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "we first screened the x - ray data from both the gis and sis with the normal criteria : i.e. we rejected the data obtained in the saa ( south atlantic anomaly ) , those with a cut - off rigidity lower than 4  gv , and those with an elevation angle lower than @xmath5 .",
    "we then rejected the particle events in the gis with a rise - time discrimination technique , and the sis data obtained when the elevation angle from the bright earth was lower than @xmath6 .",
    "the effects of rdd ( residual dark distribution ) in the sis data were corrected if the observation was carried out later than 1996 with the method given in dotani et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . after the screening , the total available exposure time of two",
    "giss was @xmath7  ks .",
    "the gis is more suitable than the sis for x - ray population studies , because of its larger field of view , larger effective area at high energy , and better time resolution .",
    "this paper thus mainly utilizes the gis data , except for particular objects which require high energy resolution and soft x - ray sensitivity .",
    "photon events for individual x - ray sources were extracted from a circle of @xmath8 radius , in which @xmath9% of incident photons are contained ( serlemitsos et al .",
    "1995 ) , or an ellipse for sources located significantly off - axis because of the distortion of the point spread function of the asca xrts .",
    "background data were taken from a nearby off - source area for each source . in some source - crowded areas",
    ", we selected a smaller circle with a radius @xmath10@xmath11 to minimize cross talk from nearby sources .",
    "figure [ fig : smc ] shows the mosaic x - ray images in the soft ( 0.72.0  kev ) and hard ( 2.07.0  kev ) bands constructed from the multiple observations and the telescope vignetting , non x - ray background and exposure differences have been corrected .",
    "of the two observations centered on smc x-1 , only one ( observation c ) , when smc x-1 was much dimmer , was used . the asca soft band image of the smc is different from those obtained with einstein and rosat ( ww92 ; k99 ) , indicating that many discrete sources in the smc are highly variable .",
    "the hard band image is the first such image obtained for the smc and it is found to have significant differences from the soft band image .",
    "x - ray sources were identified from the soft / hard band images from each observation , with the criterion that the @xmath12 ratio should exceed 5-@xmath4 in at least one of the two - band images . consequently",
    "39 sources were found and are listed in table [ tab : smccat ] .",
    "the separation angle @xmath13 between sources no.4 and no.5 is comparable to the half power radius of the xrt , hence we estimated the @xmath12 ratio in a circle containing both of them and found it exceed 5-@xmath4 . since no.4 appeared to be prominent in the soft band while no.5 was strong in the hard band , we are confident that there really exist two separate soft ( no.4 ) and hard ( no.5 ) sources .",
    "the @xmath12 ratio of no.34 exceeds 5-@xmath4 in the hard band , while in the soft band it suffers severe contamination from no.30 .",
    "we derived hardness ratios ( hrs ) for all the sources except for no.4 , no.5 , and no.34 , and cataloged them in table [ tab : smccat ] .",
    "the hr is defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the background subtracted gis count rates in the 2.07.0  kev and 0.72.0  kev bands respectively .",
    "we performed an fft ( fast fourier transform ) analysis on all the sources to search for coherent pulsations .",
    "we used only high - bit rate data in order to utilize the maximum time resolution ( up to 62.5  ms ) for those sources with high count rates .",
    "otherwise we used high - bit and medium - bit data simultaneously to achieve better statistics at the sacrifice of the time resolution reduced to 0.5  s. we detected coherent pulsations from 11 sources , five of which are new discoveries from this study .",
    "we show a power spectrum obtained from smc x-1 ( no.38 ; in observation a ) in figure [ fig : psd ] ( a ) as an example of unambiguous detection .",
    "only ax j0105@xmath17722 showed rather weak sign of pulsations as shown in figure [ fig : psd ] ( b ) .",
    "for the 11 sources from which pulsations were detected in the fft analysis , we performed an epoch folding search to determine more precise pulse periods .",
    "in addition , the orbital doppler effect was corrected for smc x-1 , using the ephemeris presented in wojdowski et al .",
    "these derived pulse periods are presented in table [ tab : pcat ] .",
    "we found no coherent period in the fft power spectra from three sources positionally coincident with known pulsars : xte j0055@xmath17724 ( no.16 ) , smc x-1 ( no.38 ; in observation c ) , and rx j0052.1@xmath177319 ( no.14 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we tried the epoch folding search .",
    "a weak peak was detected from source no.16 near the known period @xmath18  s as shown in figure [ fig : efs ] , which indicates that no.16 is a counterpart of xte j0055@xmath17724 .",
    "this period is , however , not referred in table [ tab : pcat ] , simply because this source was relatively dim , and any reliable period was not obtained .",
    "we also searched for burst - like activity by using light curves binned with various time scales from @xmath191  second to @xmath191  hour .",
    "however , no bursts were found .",

    "the other snrs dem s128 , 0056@xmath17725 , and 0049@xmath17736 were out of the sis fields .",

    "such a simple method is not valid for x - ray sources in our galaxy , because soft x - rays are absorbed by interstellar matter which gives a dependence of the hr on source distance .    to check this",
    ", we simulated hrs for simple spectra either of thin - thermal plasma with a temperature of 0.5  kev , a typical value for a thermal snr , or power - law with a photon index of 1.0 , a typical value for an xbp . when the absorption column density is @xmath81  h  @xmath44 , which roughly corresponds to a distance of 1  kpc , hrs are @xmath170.89 and 0.36 , for the thermal and power - law model , respectively .",
    "for a larger absorption column density of @xmath82  h  @xmath44 , which is equivalent to the galactic center region , the hr of the thermal model or the power - law model increased to be 0.5 or 0.96 , respectively .",
    "we therefore conclude that in our galaxy the hr values can have a large scatter even for the same class , depending on the source distances . on the other hand , according to hi observations made by luks ( 1994 ) , we can safely assume that the interstellar absorption is rather uniform towards the smc and lmc with a scale down to @xmath83 ( hpbw ) .",
    "in fact , hi column density derived by luks ( 1994 ) was @xmath84@xmath85  h  @xmath44 . within this @xmath25 range ,",
    "the hr values vary very small : from @xmath170.94 to @xmath170.81 ( thin - thermal spectra ) or from 0.25 to 0.48 ( power - law spectra ) .",
    "thus we conclude that possible uncertainty of hr due to the @xmath25 spatial variation is smaller than the width of the xbp region and thermal snr region , hence the present classification by hr value should be reliable for x - ray sources in the magellanic clouds .",

    "hence we can safely select candidates for xbps or for thermal snrs using hrs . among the unclassified sources , shown by squares in figure [ fig : hr - lobs_smclmc_class_unid ] , we find eight xbp candidates and one thermal snr candidate .",

    "accordingly , the high ratio in the smc implies rather recent star formation activity about several @xmath90  yr ago .    both crab - like snrs and hmxbs originate from massive stars : the former from a single star , while the latter from a binary system",
    ". the number ratios of these classes in our galaxy ( 7/70 ) and that in the smc ( 0/33 ) are largely different from each other in spite of the similar origin .",
    "this may imply that the formation efficiency of massive binary stars relative to that of single massive stars was much higher in the smc than in our galaxy .",
    "we have performed systematic analyses of x - ray sources in the smc with all the available data obtained with asca .    among the 16 x - ray pulsars in the smc , five",
    "were newly discovered during our analyses .",
    "we also confirmed the pulsations of another seven pulsars .",
    "we regarded 14 pulsars out of the 16 as xbps because of their flux variability and , for some sources , the existence of an optical counterpart .",
    "eight radio snrs were detected .",
    "the spectral analyses revealed that at least four snrs exhibit the emission lines of ionized atoms , hence they are expected to be thermal snrs .",
    "another two snrs are possibly emitting non - thermal x - rays .",
    "we established a simple and reliable method of source classification using the hardness ratio ( hr ) .",
    "xbps fall in a range of @xmath91 , while thermal snrs fall in a range of @xmath92 . with this method ,",
    "eight xbp candidates and one thermal snr candidate are found .",
    "normalized by the galaxy mass , hmxbs are found to be extremely populous in the smc , compared with those in our galaxy .",
    "an even more striking contrast between the two galaxies is the number ratio of hmxbs to lmxb ; it is 33/0 in the smc but is 70/100 in our galaxy .",
    "the lack of crab - like snrs in the smc may indicate that the formation of single massive stars in the smc was less active than that of binary systems .",
    "the authors express their thanks to all the members of the asca team .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
    "j.y . and m.n .",
