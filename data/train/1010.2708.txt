    "the main interests of the cosmic - ray study now shift to the highest energy region , @xmath1 ev , using huge experimental apparatus to search for astrophysical sources and the acceleration or emission mechanism of those extreme high energy cosmic - rays .",
    "however , half a century after its discovery , the `` knee '' in the cosmic - ray spectrum , a steepening of the energy spectrum at @xmath2 ev , is still not well understood .",
    "because of the low intensities , direct observations of primary cosmic - rays in this energy range are still not possible and so various types of air - shower experiments at high mountains and also at ground level have been carried out in order to investigate the chemical composition of primary cosmic - rays in this energy region which gives important information on the physical origin of cosmic - rays @xcite .",
    "the experimental data in those indirect measurement are usually interpreted by comparing with monte carlo simulations assuming some models of cosmic - ray interactions .",
    "many experimental groups claim that the fraction of heavy primaries increases rapidly beyond the `` knee '' region , e.g. , the fraction of protons is estimated by the tibet as-@xmath0 group @xcite to be as small as @xmath310% of all particles for @xmath4 ev .",
    "the results , however , depend on their assumed interaction model .",
    "for example , the epos model recently proposed @xcite gives muon numbers much more than the qgsjet model . the events which can be interpreted due to heavy primary when we employ the qgsjet model as nuclear interactions are interpreted due to proton primaries when epos is used as the interaction model @xcite .",
    "thus the interpretations rely heavily on the monte carlo calculations .",
    "in fact , various experimental groups give various data on chemical composition in this energy region and the results are still very confusing .",
    "we should examine whether the overall experimental data can be well interpreted by the assumed model before drawing a conclusion .",
    "hybrid experiments operating simultaneously an air - shower array , a hadron calorimeter and an emulsion chamber have been carried out at mt .",
    "chacaltaya ( 5200 m , bolivia ) @xcite , yang - bajing ( 4300 m , china ) @xcite and tien - shan ( 3340 m , kazakhstan ) @xcite for studying cosmic - ray nuclear interaction in the energy region around @xmath5 ev . in the hybrid experiments ,",
    "we can obtain the air - shower size , @xmath6 , from the air - shower array data , particle - density , @xmath7 , which are closely connected to the hadron component in the air - shower , from the hadron calorimeter ( burst detector ) and energy and geometrical position of individual high energy electromagnetic particles by the emulsion chamber .",
    "correlations between air - showers and accompanying families were studied so far in these three experiments by comparing experimental data and simulated data @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show some results obtained by studying correlations between the hadron component ( data of hadron calorimeters ) and families observed by emulsion chamber which are considered to be very sensitive to the mechanism of cosmic - ray interactions , using data of the chacaltaya hybrid experiment .    .",
    "solid lines are for proton - dominant composition and dotted lines for heavy - dominant composition@xcite.,width=226 ]    @xcite . , width=226 ]",
    "the shower - size , @xmath6 , dependence on the family energy and on the lateral spread of the showers in the air - shower - triggered families were studied in the three hybrid experiments at high mountains . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have shown that the average family energy normalized by associating air - shower size , @xmath8 , of the events with @xmath9 observed in these hybrid experiments agree more or less to those expected in the case of heavy - dominant composition of primary particles , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , though the difference in the average value between the two chemical composition , proton - dominant and heavy - dominant , is not clear at the tien - shan altitude , especially in the case of the epos model .",
    "some details of simulations are shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "the lateral spread of high energy showers in the families accompanied by the air - showers with @xmath9 was also studied experiments . ] .",
    "the average lateral spread of showers in those families observed in the chacaltaya experiment , shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , is found to be smaller than that expected in the case of a heavy - dominant composition .",
    "the difference in the average lateral spread between the two chemical compositions is again not clear in the tien - shan data .",
    "the chacaltaya data show that the proton - dominant composition is favorable to explain the small lateral spread of the families but the heavy - dominant composition is favorable to explain small family energy .",
    "thus the increase of heavier composition of primary cosmic rays alone can not explain the general characteristics of air - shower - triggered families , contrary to the results of the tibet group and others @xcite .",
    "+ the data of hadron calorimeters were also analyzed by the chacaltaya and tibet groups .",
    "the tibet group concluded from the analysis that the experimental data were well explained by a heavy dominant composition of primary particles @xcite but the chacaltaya group concluded that the number of hadrons in the air - showers was less than expected @xcite .",
    "the air - shower array covers a circular area within a radius about 50 m by 35 plastic scintillation detectors to measure the lateral distribution of the electron density of the air - showers . in the center of the air - shower array ,",
    "32 blocks of emulsion chambers ( 0.25 m@xmath10 each ) are installed ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "each block of the emulsion chamber consists of 30 lead plates each of 0.5 cm thick and 14 sensitive layers of x - ray film which are inserted after every 1 cm lead .",
    "the total area of the emulsion chambers is 8 m@xmath10 .",
    "hadron calorimeters with plastic scintillator of 5 cm thickness are installed underneath the respective blocks of the emulsion chamber ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "an iron support of 2 cm thick is inserted between the emulsion chamber and the hadron calorimeter .",
    "some detail of the chacaltaya hybrid experiment are described in refs.@xcite",
    "for generating extensive air - showers and families we use the corsika simulation code ( version 6.735 ) @xcite employing the qgsjet model ( qgsjet01c ) @xcite and the epos model ( epos 1.60 ) @xcite for the cosmic - ray nuclear interaction .",

    "we use the qgsjet model for hadron - pb interactions and a code formulated by okamoto and shibata for electromagnetic cascades @xcite .",
    "the electron number density under every 1 cm pb is transformed into spot darkness of the x - ray film .",

    "hadron calorimeters detect a bundle of charged particles , which are produced in the emulsion chamber material by the hadron component in the air - shower through local nuclear interactions .",
    "output from each unit of the hadron calorimeter is related to the energy deposited in the scintillator , and is converted to a charged particle number using the average energy loss of a single muon in the scintillator .",
    "the number of charged particles per 50 cm @xmath23 50 cm , @xmath7 , is called the `` burst density '' hereafter .",
    "we use the geant4 code @xcite for calculating the burst - density .",
    "we calculate the average number of charged particles produced in the emulsion chamber of 15 cmpb and arriving at the scintillator of the hadron calorimeter for hadrons ( pions , proton , kaons ) , muons and high energy @xmath24 in the air - shower , with 4 different energies of 10 gev , 100 gev , 1 tev and 10 tev and 5 different zenith angles of arrival direction .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows an example of the energy dependence of average number of charged particles which responds to scintillator for six different incident particles .",
    "the dependences are approximated by numerical functions and extrapolate to higher or lower energy range of the incident particles . applying these functions to every particle incident upon the emulsion chamber , we get the burst - density in each block of 32 hadron calorimeters . we define @xmath25 as the largest burst - density among the 32 blocks of the hadron calorimeters and @xmath26 as the sum of burst - density of 32 blocks . in the following",
    "we pick up events which satisfy the following criteria ;    * @xmath27 , * @xmath28 , * @xmath29 m , + where @xmath30 is the distance between the burst center and the air - shower center .    the burst center is determined by the algorithm described in ref.@xcite . in the chacaltaya data , 1,034 events",
    "satisfy the above criteria in @xmath31 m@xmath10year exposure of hadron calorimeters . among them , 73 events are accompanied by high energy atmospheric families of @xmath32 10 tev ( @xmath33 tev ) . figure  [ fig6 ] show examples of experimental and simulated burst data .",
    "we can see the lateral distribution of the burst - density is well described by the power law function @xcite .                in table 1",
    ", we show the fraction of proton , he , cno , heavy and fe components in the air - showers accompanied by families and also those accompanied by burst . in the shower - size region of @xmath34 , corresponding to @xmath35 ev , the fraction of each component is similar to those assumed in the primary particles because almost all air - showers in this air - shower size region accompany families and bursts .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows a scatter diagram between air - shower size , @xmath6 , and maximum burst density , @xmath25 , of the event for the experimental data and for the simulated data of proton- and fe - primaries . in the events of iron - primaries",
    ", @xmath25 is more or less proportional to @xmath6 though @xmath25 is weakly correlated to @xmath6 for the events of proton primaries .",
    "it is very natural because fe - air - nucleus interactions are assumed to be the superposition of a number of low energy nucleon - air - nucleus collisions and so the fluctuation becomes small .",
    "but for proton - air - nucleus interactions , the position of interactions and/or released energy at the interaction fluctuate widely event by event .",
    "the distribution in the experimental data looks close to that in proton - primaries .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows distributions of @xmath36 for four different chemical composition of primary particles , pure proton , pure iron , proton - dominant and heavy dominant .",
    "the shape of the distribution for pure - iron primaries is very different from that for the others .",
    "there are almost no events with @xmath37 ( log@xmath38 in the iron - induced air - showers . on the contrary ,",
    "a considerable number of events are found in this region of the distribution for proton - induced air - showers .",
    "there is no systematic difference in the shape for the other three chemical compositions , pure protons , proton - dominant and heavy dominant , and also for the two different interaction models , qgsjet and epos .",
    "the experimental data are well described by the model calculation for these three chemical compositions of primary particles .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the distribution of @xmath39 where @xmath26 is a sum of @xmath7 over 32 blocks of hadron calorimeters .",
    "again we can see the experimental data are close to those expected for pure protons or mixed chemical composition of proton - dominant and heavy - dominant , though the number of events with smaller @xmath26 are less than expectation .",
    "an almost similar analysis was done by the tibet group and they concluded that their data are well described by a heavy dominant composition ( see ref.@xcite ) .    .",
    "circles are experimental data and lines are simulated data , solid lines : proton - primaries , dotted lines : fe - primaries . , width=264 ]    .",
    "circles are experimental data and lines are simulated data , solid lines : proton - primaries , dotted lines : fe - primaries . , width=257 ]",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows a correlation diagram between @xmath25 , maximum of burst size among 32 blocks of the event and accompanying family energy .",
    "the experimental data are compared with those of simulated data of proton - primaries and iron - primaries . as seen in the figure , the family energy is almost proportional to @xmath25 in the simulated data irrespective of the primary particles though the family energy of the events coming from iron - primaries are smaller than that from proton - primaries . in the figure",
    "we can see the family energy in the experimental data is systematically smaller than that of simulated data in the events with larger burst - density , @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] shows an average family energy versus @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear that the experimental data can not be explained simply by changing the chemical composition of primary particles .",
    "one may argue that the smaller family energy in the experimental data is due to the systematic underestimation of the shower energy in the emulsion chamber .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows a comparison of the integral spectra of family energy observed by the present hybrid experiment and that by the emulsion chamber experiment of the brazil - japan collaboration@xcite .",
    "as seen in the figure , the two spectra smoothly connect with each other .",
    "thus we can conclude that the energy estimation of high energy particles in the emulsion chamber of the present hybrid experiment is not much different from that of the emulsion chamber experiment of the brazil - japan collaboration .",
    "one may also argue about an overestimation of the burst - density , especially beyond the region of @xmath41 .",
    "but this possibility is also ruled out , because the distribution on @xmath42 is well described by the simulations as seen in figure  [ fig8 ] .     and",

    ", width=264 ]     in the burst - triggered families .",
    ", width=264 ]        , and accompanied family energy , @xmath43 , of the events shown in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    ", width=264 ]",
    "the previous analysis on the air - shower - triggered families shows that the average family energy of the experimental data is considerably smaller than that of simulations of proton - dominant primaries in the shower size region of @xmath45 , as described in section 2 . in figure  [ fig13 ]",
    "we show a correlation diagram between family energy , @xmath43 and associated air - shower size , @xmath6 , for the same events shown in fig.10 . in the air - shower - size region of @xmath9 ,",
    "the family energy in the experimental data is systematically smaller than that expected for proton - primaries and those events look like coming from iron - primaries .",
    "the characteristics of the bursts accompanied by the proton - induced air - showers are very different from those accompanied by iron - induced ones , as shown in figure  [ fig7 ] . the considerable number of air - showers induced by proton - primaries accompany large burst - density which are not seen in the iron - induced air - showers , and the experimental data are close to those expected in case of proton - primaries .",
    "the contradiction of the above two arguments is well seen in the correlation digram between bursts and families , shown in figure  [ fig10 ] and no model can describe the observed correlation .    the spectra of high energy particles detected by the emulsion chambers are more sensitive to the mechanism of the particle production of the most forward region of the rapidity .",
    "the hadron calorimeter supplies the data of hadron component in the air - shower .",
    "the hadron component in the air - shower bears more direct information on the nuclear interaction than any other component such as electron and muon component in the air - shower , and the burst - size of hadron calorimeter gives a measure of interaction energy .",
    "suppose the @xmath46-distribution of the produced particles becomes steeper , the number of high energy particles detected in the emulsion chamber becomes small ( i.e. , detected family energy becomes smaller ) , because of the high threshold energy of the emulsion chambers .",
    "the hadron component detected by hadron calorimeters , however , does not change much because of the lower detection threshold energy .",
    "then the ration of @xmath47 becomes smaller .",
    "the observed discrepancy between experimental data and simulated data can be explain in this way , that is , the experimental data indicate the @xmath46-distribution of produced particles in the cosmic - ray nuclear interactions of @xmath48 ev is much steeper than that assumed in the models .",
