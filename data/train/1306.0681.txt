    "one way is to measure the depinning field to pull a vortex out of a pinning potential in the presence of a spin - polarized current @xcite .",
    "a similar technique consists of looking at the thermal hopping between pinning sites in the presence of a spin - polarized current @xcite where different values for @xmath6 for the same material are estimated depending on the considered magnetic structure : a vortex domain wall or a transverse domain wall .",

    "/ depinning threshold the vortex core switches polarization and moves to the opposite nanowire edge ( see supplementary movies m3 and m4 ) .",
    "for @xmath36 the vortex core moves perfectly along the nanowire center .      in a disordered nanowire ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_core_switches ] and supplementary movies m5 and m6 ) , the vortex core can switch polarization at a defect , implying a change in lateral propagation direction and thus hindering the formation of the transverse domain wall .",
    "this polarization switching mechanism , which was not found @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite , explains the absence of the walker breakdown and the much smaller depinning threshold .",
    "the pinning mechanism itself is also affected by the disorder : instead of the intrinsic pinning mechanism induced by the internal balancing of the effective field and spin - transfer torques inside the transverse domain wall found in a perfect nanowire , disorder gives rise to an extrinsic pinning mechanism in which the vortex core gets pinned at a defect . in the experimentally accessible current ranges ,",
    "we observe an average motion of the vortex core in the central region of the wire without the formation of transverse domain walls due to successive core switches at defects .",
    "this resembles the motion of a vortex domain wall in a perfect wire for the case @xmath36 , which explains the values of @xmath10 derived from domain wall motion ( table [ tabel ] ) .",
    "+     snapshots of vortex domain wall motion in a disordered py nanowire , 400 nm wide and 10 nm thick .",

    "@xcite we have also investigated the effect of voids on the domain wall mobility and have found qualitatively the same mobility curves .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the pinning potentials caused by this type of disorder are much deeper @xcite , and therefore also allow vortex core polarization switching , resulting in the same type of motion .",
    "thus , we expect that all types of defects that give rise to pinning potentials that are sufficiently deep ( e.g. voids , grain boundaries , thickness fluctuations ,  ) allow vortex core polarization switching and consequently lead to the same mobility .",
    "+ due to the consecutive polarization switches at defects , the vortex core generally does not reach the edges of the nanowire .",
    "however , in the event it does happen , we observe that defects at the edges allow the nucleation of a vortex core of opposite polarity , as is the case in wires with edge roughness @xcite .",
    "+ in contrast to the 0k temperature we considered in the simulations , a non - zero temperature results in thermally activated depinning and finite but small velocities in a creep regime @xcite .",
    "we checked the influence of temperature on the observed phenomena .",
    "however , apart from introducing non - zero velocities slightly below the depinning threshold ( creep regime ) , no influence was seen on the domain wall mobility in the flow regime .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that material defects vastly influence the domain wall dynamics .",
    "the defects enable the vortex core to successively switch polarization , hindering the transverse domain wall formation . as a result the intrinsic pinning ( adiabatic case ) as well as the walker breakdown ( non - adiabatic case ) are absent .",
    "furthermore , at low currents the domain wall is extrinsically pinned .",
    "the successive vortex core switches give rise to a motion of the vortex core in the central region of the nanowire , as also present in perfect nanowires with a degree of non - adiabaticity equal to the gilbert damping .",
    "this explains the consistently lower values @xmath7 found in experiments based on measurements of the average velocity of vortex domain walls in nanowires .",
    "+ these results show that realistic material defects have a significant influence on the domain wall mobility and not only in the creep regime .",
    "therefore , defects should be properly considered when evaluating experimental data and when new concepts are introduced to enhance the domain wall mobility , e.g. by spin - hall and rashba effects .",
