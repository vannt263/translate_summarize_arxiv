    "strong magnetic fields present in all the objects of the observed universe . as it is believed , these fields presented at previous stages of its evolution .",
    "they also are produced in the heavy ion collisions at high energies and influence various processes and characteristics of plasma , in particular , the deconfinement phase transition temperature .",
    "so , searching for effective mechanisms for generation of different type magnetic fields at high temperature is of great importance for either particle physics or cosmology .",
    "these mechanisms could serve as a theoretical background for investigations of the qcd vacuum at high temperature in magnetic fields @xcite and the primordial magnetic fields in the early universe @xcite .",
    "recent discovery of extragalactic magnetic fields possessing the field strength of the order @xmath10 at @xmath11 scale @xcite is one of the most bright events of modern cosmology . in @xcite a model - independent 95% cl interval @xmath12",
    "is determined , and the femtogauss values are actual field strengths in intergalactic space .",
    "notice that already as the strengths of the intergalactic fields the values @xmath13 have been discussed as the most probable ones .",
    "first of all , it makes most reasonable the cosmological origin of primordial magnetic fields . from theoretical point of view",
    ", this discovery restricts in an essential way possible processes supplying the generation of fields in the hot universe @xcite .",
    "so that searching for mechanisms of their creation is intensified . of course , the prime candidates are the primordial fluctuations .",
    "but there are more candidates , for a review see @xcite .",
    "a challenge is to produce coherent magnetic fields on different large scales in almost empty intergalactic space .",
    "different mechanisms operating at different stages of the evolution and , consequently , different temperatures are proposed in the literature .",
    "these are trace anomalies , inflation , stochastic electric currents , cosmic strings , paramagnetic resonances , etc . , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we review one of possibilities  spontaneous magnetization of the vacuum of non - abelian gauge fields at high temperature .",
    "this phenomenon qualitatively ( or phenomenologically ) is similar to ferromagnetic media , where the magnetic domains are formed due to spin interactions of charged particles . in field theory",
    ", the role of these particles plays the quantum fluctuations of colored non - abelian gauge fields having a large magnetic moment ( gyromagnetic ratio @xmath14 of charged gluons and @xmath15-bosons ) .",
    "just due to this large value of magnetic moments the vacuum magnetization happens . the fields generated spontaneously are long - range , temperature dependent and stable .",
    "all these features make them very attractive objects for various applications . in the frame of the standard model ( sm ) of particle , the @xmath16 color magnetic fields related with strong interactions and @xmath17 components of usual magnetic field",
    "are generated at high temperature .",
    "of course , other type chromomagnetic fields , depending on the gauge groups , could be present in the early universe . in what follows",
    ", we describe this phenomenon and , as application , consider the generation of intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization of the vacuum of non - abelian gauge fields at finite temperature was discovered recently in @xmath18 gluodynamics .",
    "it was investigated either by analytic methods in @xcite or in lattice simulations in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea rests on the known fact that the spontaneous vacuum magnetization is the consequence of the spectrum of a color charged gluon , @xmath19 in a homogeneous magnetic background , @xmath20 , described by the potential @xmath21 where @xmath22 is weak isotopic index , and @xmath23 is a momentum component along the field direction .",
    "this abelian type field is the solution to the classical gauge field equations without source terms . here , a tachyon mode is present in the ground state ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "in fact , one observes @xmath25 resulting from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the spin-1 charged particles with the magnetic field .",
    "this phenomenon was firstly discovered by savvidy @xcite at zero temperature , @xmath26 , and become known as savvidy vacuum .",
    "however , at zero temperature , this state is not stable .",
    "it decays under emission of gluons until the magnetic field @xmath20 disappears .",
    "this picture changes with increasing of the temperature when a stabilization sets in .",
    "the stabilization is due to a vacuum polarization .",
    "it depends on two dynamical parameters appearing at @xmath27 .",
    "these are a magnetic mass of the color charged gluon , @xmath28 and a @xmath29-condensate , which is proportional to the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "this field configuration is stable , its energy is below the perturbation one and the minimum is reached for the field strengths of order @xmath30 .",
    "this phenomenon is common for different @xmath31 gauge groups which can be used to extend the standard @xmath32 model of elementary particles .",
    "an important property of such temperature dependent magnetic fields is the vanishing of their magnetic mass , @xmath33 .",
    "it was found both in one - loop analytic calculations @xcite and lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "the mass parameter describes the inverse spatial scales of the transverse field components , similarly to the debye mass @xmath34 related to the inverse space scale for the electric ( coulomb ) component .",
    "the absence of the screening mass means that the spontaneously generated abelian chromomagnetic fields are long - range at high temperature , as it is common for the @xmath4 magnetic field .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to believe that , in the hot universe , at each stage of its evolution spontaneously created , strong , long - range magnetic fields of different types have been present .",
    "the fields influenced various processes and phase transitions .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to describe the main points of the vacuum magnetization phenomenon , investigate the properties of the created fields and discuss some possible physical consequences of it .",
    "in fact , this phenomenon is a non - perturbative one .",
    "so , the main results have been obtained both in continuum field theory and in the lattice simulations .",
    "the results are in agreement with each other .",
    "every method of calculations mentioned has specific features which will be described below .",
    "we consider the magnetization in the sm as well as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at high temperatures and compare the results .",
    "we describe the mechanisms resulting in stabilization of the magnetized vacuum . as an application",
    ", we consider the origin of intergalactic magnetic fields at the reheating stage of the universe evolution that will be investigated in more details .",
    "it worth mentioning that one of difficult problems of magnetogenesis is to relate the field strengths generated in the early universe with the present day fields , that depends on numerous factors and is model dependent .",
    "these points will be discussed also .    in the next section ,",
    "we start with analytic calculations and describe the consistent effective potential ( ep ) @xmath35 of magnetic and scalar fields used in studying of the spontaneous vacuum magnetization in the sm .",
    "the main observation here is that the magnetization does not happen when a sufficiently large scalar field condensate @xmath36 is present .",
    "it means , in particular , that after electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) the spontaneous vacuum magnetization does not happen .",
    "this concerns the usual magnetic field related with @xmath17 gauge group .",
    "chromomagnetic field does not couple to @xmath37 and therefore may exist till the deconfinement phase transition temperature @xmath38 . in what follows , we consider the magnetization in different models of particles for the case of @xmath39 , only .",
    "3 is devoted to investigation of the vacuum magnetization for the sm .",
    "the temperature masses in the field presence is discussed in sect .",
    "sects .  5",
    ", 6 are dealing with calculation of the debye and magnetic masses for neutral and charged gluons at high temperature in the external magnetic field presence .",
    "for these purposes the one - loop gluon polarization tensors are calculated and investigated . then in sects .  7 and 8 we turn to non - perturbative methods and investigate the vacuum magnetization and the magnetic mass of neutral gluons at finite temperature in the field presence by using the monte carlo ( mc ) methods on the lattice .",
    "we obtain the results coinciding with that of the analytic calculations . in sect .",
    "9 we develop a procedure for relating magnetic fields generated in the hot universe with the present day magnetic fields and estimate the field strength at the ewpt temperature @xmath8 . in sect .",
    "10 the scale of magnetic fields at different temperatures is estimated .",
    "discussion of the results obtained and prospects is given in the final section .",
    "as we noted above , the spontaneous vacuum magnetization and the absence of the magnetic mass for the abelian magnetic fields are non - perturbative effects to be determined , in particular , in lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of these investigations are that the stable magnetized vacuum does exist at high temperature and that the magnetic mass of the created field is zero . concerning the actual value of the field strength , it is close to the one calculated within the consistent effective potential which takes into account the one - loop plus daisy diagrams .",
    "so , in analytic calculations we restrict ourselves to this approximation .",
    "the complete ep for the sm is given in @xcite .",
    "its general structure reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a scalar field condensate .",
    "the first two terms describe the tree level contributions of classical magnetic and scalar fields , @xmath42 is the one - loop contributions of all the fields and the last term presents the contributions of ring ( or daisy ) diagrams giving the main long - range correlation corrections . to find @xmath43 the one - loop polarization operators",
    "of charged , @xmath44 and neutral , @xmath45 gluons in the external field and at finite temperature have to be calculated in the limit of zero momenta",
    ". then @xmath46 is given by the series depicted in figures [ figringneutral ] , [ figringcharged ] . here",
    ", the dashed lines describe the neutral gluons and the wavy lines represent the charged ones , blobs stand for the one - loop polarization operators .",
    "the diagrams with one blob show the two - loop terms of the ep , with two blobs - three - loop ones , etc .",
    "the one - loop terms have the orders @xmath47 and @xmath48 in a fine structure constant and a scalar self - interaction coupling .",
    "the order of the rings is @xmath49 , correspondingly .",
    "so that these diagrams are dominant compared to the two - loop contributions having the order @xmath50 .",
    "as it is well known , the ep ( [ ep ] ) is a consistent approximation because it is real at sufficiently high temperature ( see for details @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so , it will be used in the following .    in the present study",
    "we are interested in two limits of it :    1 .   weak magnetic field and large scalar field condensate , @xmath51 , 2 .",
    "the case of the restored symmetry , @xmath52 .    for the former case",
    "we show the absence of spontaneous vacuum magnetization at finite temperature . for the latter one we estimate the field strength at high temperature .    to demonstrate the first property we consider the one - loop contribution of @xmath15-bosons calculated in a standard way as the sum over the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) ( see ref .",

    "in fact , other terms of the ep have to be added .",
    "however , to elucidate the role of the scalar field condensate this term is sufficient .",
    "now , let us show that the spontaneous vacuum magnetization does not happen at finite temperature and for non small values of the scalar field condensate @xmath61 . to do that we notice that the magnetization is produced by the gauge field contribution , given in eq .",
    "( [ l2 t ] ) .",
    "so , we consider the limit of @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for this case",
    "we use the asymptotic expansion of @xmath55 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "now , we investigate the limit of @xmath66 . for this case",
    "the leading contribution is given by the first term of the temperature sum in eq .",
    "( [ l2 t ] ) .",
    "we can also substitute @xmath67 . in this approximation",
    ", the sum of the tree level energy and ( [ l2 t ] ) reads @xmath68 the second term is exponentially small and the stationary equation @xmath69 has the trivial solution @xmath70 .",
    "this estimate can be verified easily in numeric calculation for the total ep .",
    "hence , we conclude that after symmetry breaking the spontaneous vacuum magnetization does not take place , as at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the main goal of our investigation is the restored phase of the sm .",
    "to begin , we adduce the high temperature contribution of the complete effective potential relevant for this case using the results in  @xcite .",
    "first we write down the one - loop @xmath15-boson contribution as the sum of the pure yang - mills weak - isospin part @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is weak isospin gauge coupling constant , @xmath74 is a temperature normalization point , and the charged scalars @xcite @xmath75 describing the contribution of longitudinal vector components .",
    "remind that electric charge is expressed through @xmath73 and the weinberg angle as @xmath76 . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ vw ] ) is the tree - level energy of the field .",
    "this representation is convenient for the case of extended models including other gauge and scalar fields .",
    "dependently on a specific case , one can take into consideration the parts ( [ vw ] ) , ( [ vscalar ] ) , correspondingly .",
    "in the sm , the contribution of eq .",
    "( [ vscalar ] ) has to be taken with the factor 2 , due to two charged scalar fields entering the scalar doublet of the model . in the case of the two - higgs - doublet sm",
    ", this factor must be 4 , etc .",
    "the imaginary part is generated because of the unstable mode in the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "it is canceled by the term appearing in the contribution of the ring ( daisy ) diagrams for the unstable mode @xcite @xmath77^{1/2 } + i \\frac{(g \\tilde{b})^{3/2 } t}{2 \\pi}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath78 is the mean value for the charged gluon polarization tensor taken in the ground state @xmath79 of the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "a more presize definition is given below .",
    "if this value is sufficiently large , spectrum stabilization due to radiation correction is realized .",
    "the cancelation of imaginary terms in the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ vw ] ) and ( [ ringdaisy ] ) and , hence , the vacuum stabilization is similar to that in scalar field theory at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "it means that the one - loop plus ring diagram contributions give a consistent effective potential at high temperature .",
    "moreover , the ring diagrams have the order @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 is scalar theory ) . therefore for small couplings they are more important as two - loop contributions having the orders @xmath82 and @xmath83 , correspondingly .    in the gauge field case ,",
    "the possibility of stabilization formally follows from the temperature and field dependence of the polarization tensor in the high temperature limit @xmath84 @xcite : @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a constant which must be calculated explicitly . at high temperature",
    "the first term can be larger than @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the accounting for of rings leads to the vacuum stabilization .",
    "it is obvious in the high temperature limit .",
    "but it also is the case for non - asymptotic temperatures .",
    "this is discussed in more details in the next section .",
    "it worth to mention that for gauge fields there are two types of rings .",
    "first is related with longitudinal electric components of @xmath88 .",
    "second takes into consideration the properties of the transversal long range modes .",
    "just the contribution of the latter modes is given in eq .",
    "( [ ringdaisy ] ) .",
    "the high temperature limit of the fermion contribution looks as follows @xcite , @xmath89 where the sum is extended to all the leptons and quarks , and @xmath90 is the fermion electric charge in positron units .",

    "it is one of the main objects for the problem of interest .",
    "we consider calculation of both neutral and charged modes of it in sects .  5 , 6 .",
    "the expression ( [ piunstable ] ) contains the imaginary part which comes from the unstable mode in the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "its value is of the order of the usual dumping constants in plasma at high temperature .",
    "of course , the origin of these imaginary terms is different .",
    "it will be ignored in actual calculations in what follows .",
    "this is because we are interested mainly in the high temperature case where the imaginary part remaining after cancelation of the imaginary terms in eqs .",
    "( [ vw ] ) and ( [ ringdaisy ] ) is of the next - to - leading order in the consistent effective potential .",
    "in fact , this part must be calculated in a more consistent scheme which starts with a regularized stable spectrum .",
    "the stabilization can be realized not only by the radiation corrections but also some other mechanisms .",
    "we observed a stable vacuum state in the lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe that this problem has a positive solution . other important observation obtained is the absence of the vacuum magnetization at not small values of the scalar field condensate , @xmath36 . in particular",
    ", this means that just after the electroweak phase transition this phenomenon does not hold .",
    "the ep ( [ l2 t ] ) ( and other terms in  @xcite ) is expressed through the well known special functions . therefore , it can easily be investigated numerically for any range of parameters entering .",
    "as usually , it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables : the field @xmath110 and the ep @xmath111 .",
    "the vacuum magnetization at high temperatures , @xmath112 , can be investigated within the following limiting form of the total ep , @xmath113 where @xmath114 terms were omitted .",
    "the logarithmic term is signaling asymptotic freedom in the field at high temperatures . in this approximation ,",
    "the role of the ring diagrams is reduced to the cancelation of the imaginary part in eq .",
    "( [ vw ] ) , only . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ ringdaisy ] ) has the order @xmath115 and can be neglected for small @xmath73 .",
    "this follows from the high temperature estimate for @xmath116 ( see eq .",
    "( [ mmass ] ) below ) .",
    "thus , in given approximation the ep is real . from eq .",
    "( [ vlim ] ) we obtain for the minimum position @xmath117 hence , we come to the conclusion that the ferromagnetic vacuum state does exist at high temperatures .",

    "this is because the second term is logarithmic suppressed ( @xmath130 compared to the first one .",
    "thus , the vacuum stabilization is expected in this consistent calculation .",
    "the above analytic investigation unambiguously determined the possibility of the vacuum magnetization at high temperature , although a number of questions has to be studied in order to derive a final picture .",
    "in fact , the radiation corrections are not the only candidate for stabilization of the vacuum .",

    "this parameter also acts as a stabilizing mass term at high temperature @xcite .",
    "its role will be discussed in what follows .",
    "let us note once again that we are dealing with infrared properties of gauge fields at high temperature .",
    "so , non - perturbative methods of calculations have to be used .",
    "below , we investigate the magnetization as well as the field characteristics by means of analytic methods and simulations on a lattice .",
    "the coincidence of the results obtained by using these methods is very important .",
    "the former are needed in determining of general analytic properties for phenomenons investigated .",
    "the latter admit obtaining of the non - perturbative results .",
    "as it is well known , at finite temperature particles acquire the temperature dependent masses which modify interactions in plasma @xcite . at zero fields , this mass is of the order @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) for quarks and longitudinal gauge field excitations . for transversal gluons ,",
    "this mass is of the order @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "so that both chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields become screened in hot qcd .",
    "these basic characteristic parameters of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) are very important .",
    "they determine the screening properties and the plasma excitations for different type gauge fields .",
    "these parameters have been calculated in analytic quantum field theory at finite temperature and simulations on the lattice .",
    "note that in scalar and spinor qed the longitudinal ( electric , debye ) mass has the order @xmath135 and the magnetic mass of photons equals to zero @xcite .",
    "therefore the latter field remains not screened long range one as in the vacuum .    at non - zero external magnetic fields ,",
    "these characteristics are not well investigated at present .",
    "this some time leads to confusions in the literature where instead of the magnetic mass the debye mass is substituted @xcite . that influences the results obtained .",
    "as it was discovered in analytic calculations @xcite and confirmed in simulations on the lattice @xcite the magnetic mass of neutral gluons calculated in the external chromomagnetic abelian field @xmath136 equals to zero",
    ". therefore this field behaves as usual magnetic field in qed .",
    "it is long range one , in contrast to the zero field case .",
    "the debye mass of these fields is field - dependent , and its value decreases with growth of the field strength @xcite .",
    "hence , the color coulomb field becomes less screened compared to the zero field case .",
    "the debye mass of charged gluons ( calculated in @xmath18 gluodynamics ) is also field - depended and coinciding with the neutral gluon value @xcite . as concerns the magnetic mass for charged gluons , it remains not well calculated .",
    "only rough estimates have been obtained already @xcite . but",
    "this parameter is of paramount importance for the plasma .    from dimensional analysis",
    "it follows that the pt at high temperature has the form @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is a constant which has to be computed . so that if @xmath139 the spectrum stabilization at high temperature ( @xmath140 ) holds . if @xmath141 , the spectrum and , therefore , external field remains unstable as at zero temperature .",
    "in fact , we have to distinguish two situations : 1 ) the spectrum can be positive for any field strengths at high temperature for @xmath139 ; 2 ) the spectrum in the field which is spontaneously generated at high temperature ( @xmath1 ) . in the later case the value of the gluon effective mass @xmath142 can be negative dependently on the value of @xmath6 .",
    "the fist case is of interest , for example , for the qgp in @xmath143-collisions , when one can expect strong external chromomagnetic fields at high temperature produced by quark currents .",
    "the second case is of interest for cosmology at @xmath144 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the properties of neutral gauge fields in the restored phase of the sm by analytic methods . as before , in actual calculations we concentrate on the electroweak sector @xmath145 of gauge fields .",
    "the color @xmath146 gluons possess similar properties which , for short , we note , only .    before proceeding in actual calculation",
    ", we say a few words about analytic calculations at finite temperature in the fields with the unstable mode in the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) . at zero temperature ,",
    "first of all one has to determine new vacuum state which follows from the instability evolution due to self - interactions of charged gauge fields .",
    "then , quantum excitations at the stable vacuum should be investigated .",
    "as also is known , in this case the color external field is completely screened by the charged gauge field condensate .",
    "different kind vacuum properties have been derived in the literature due to the instability evolution ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this screening behavior was also investigated on a lattice @xcite . at finite temperature",
    ", the situation is different . here , new dynamical parameters - temperature debye s and magnetic masses -",
    "are generated and act to stabilize the vacuum as in scalar field theory .",
    "these important parameters can be calculated in perturbation theory with unstable vacuum .",
    "the stabilization is expected at high temperature when the values of the temperature mass squared exceed the value of the tachyonic mass squared .",
    "assuming such a scenario , we can carry out calculations with unstable mode included . in this case",
    "we expect that the stabilization of the spectrum will come and external field is not screened and presents at high temperature .",
    "analytic calculations give a possibility for determining different parameters constructed aut of field strength and temperature , derivation of non - analytic relations between these parameters .",
    "these calculations also can serve as a background for numeric mc simulations and show possible qualitative picture for the phenomenon studied . by joining the results of both calculations",
    "we obtain a more deep and multilateral notion about it .",
    "first problem to study is space scale of gauge fields at finite temperature in the background field presence . to investigate this problem ,",
    "the polarization tensor of neutral gauge fields @xmath147 , where @xmath148 are gluon momentum components , must be calculated . before doing that",
    ", we remind the structure of the gauge fields in the sm .",

    "the main object of such type investigations is the difference ( magnetic flux through a lattice plaquette perpendicular to the @xmath364 axis ) : @xmath365 which is fitted for each lattice geometry @xmath328 by different functions @xmath366 .",
    "below we follow this general approach .",
    "however , here we measure the magnetic mass of the abelian field of interest , eq .",
    "( [ r22 ] ) .",
    "the temperature is introduced as before through a lattice asymmetry in the temporal direction ( @xmath329 ) .",
    "the measurements were fulfilled for the value of @xmath367 in the perturbation regime for the deconfinement phase .",

    "the plaquette average is calculated by averaging up to @xmath371 working iterations .    to estimate the behavior of magnetic fields a large amount of simulation data",

    "gpu programming model implemented here and some technical details on mc simulations on amd / ati graphics processing units ( gpu ) are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "distinguishing feature of the employed program model is that all necessary data for simulations are stored in gpu memory .",
    "gpu carries out intermediate actions and returns the results to the host program for final data handling and output .",
    "we avoid any data transfer during the run - time between the host program and kernels , to speed - up the execution process .",
    "to generate the pseudo - random numbers for mc procedure , three different pseudo - random number generators are used : ranmar , ranlux and xor128 @xcite .",
    "the last one allows to obtain the maximal performance but is not widely used in mc simulations .",
    "so , all the results were checked with the slower generators ranmar and ranlux .",
    "the gpu - based mc program allows to calculate the difference ( [ uflux ] ) for a wide interval of lattice geometries .",
    "also , up to 1000 independent runs for each lattice size were performed in order to decrease the dispersion of the obtained values @xmath372 .",
    "the whole set of simulation data for different lattice geometries were fitted with the several functions which correspond to the different behavior of magnetic flux .",

    "the functions @xmath381 , @xmath382 can be related to the increase of the field strength with a temperature increase .",
    "this is because the total magnetic flux through the lattice is growing faster than in the case of the magnetic flux tube formation .",
    "as it follows from table  2 , the best fit function is @xmath383 with a small value of the magnetic mass @xmath384 .",

    "the only natural explanation is the spontaneous generation of the field inside the volume of the lattice .",

    "we describe how to relate this expression with the present day intergalactic magnetic field @xmath435 .",
    "we first relate the expression ( [ fieldt1 ] ) with an magnetic field after symmetry breaking , and then take into account the scales of fields .",
    "let us introduce the standard parameters and definitions , @xmath436 , @xmath437 , @xmath438 and @xmath439 , where @xmath440 is a fine structure constant .",
    "to find the temperature dependence of the weinberg angle , the behavior of the hypercharge coupling @xmath153 on the temperature has to be computed . from eq .",

    "instead , for a rough estimate , we substitute the zero temperature number : @xmath441 .    for the given temperature of the ewpt , @xmath8 , the magnetic field is @xmath442 this relation is the consequence of the assumption that for the field spontaneously generated at high temperature in the early universe the magnetic flux conservation holds after the ewpt .",

    "( [ xew ] ) we obtain @xmath451 . for the present day value @xmath452",
    "this parameter is much smaller .",

    "this value was considered in numerous investigations as an upper bound on the intergalactic magnetic field strength in the universe , before the recent discoveries @xcite .",
    "note that the value of @xmath454 calculated with expression ( [ fieldt1 ] ) is close to the estimate ( [ bewsm ] ) .",
    "let us stress again that the field strength at higher temperatures will depend on the particular model extending the standard one .",
    "spontaneous vacuum magnetization in the minimal supersymmetric standard model has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the field strength generated in this model is smaller as compared to the situation here considered .",

    "an important consequence of eq .",
    "( [ fieldt1 ] ) is that at high temperatures @xmath456 the magnetic flux conservation does not hold .",
    "this follows from the logarithm term standing in the denominator .",

    "this property is very important for what follows .",
    "it is a key point for the scenario which we are going to investigate .",
    "we assume for the following that intergalactic magnetic fields have been spontaneously generated in the hot universe .",
    "note also that magnetohydrodynamical processes in the early universe were investigated in numerous publications ( see for references the review papers @xcite ) . here",
    ", we mention only the important points for our consideration .",
    "the `` frozen in '' conditions can be realized for magnetic fields having the scales of largest turbulence eddies . after a free decay stage of the magnetized plasma evolution ,",
    "the field can be considered as non - affected by turbulence @xcite . in connection with these results , it is clear that the magnetic fields generated at the ewpt are not sufficient as such to produce a long - range correlated fields and some additional processes must be included .",
    "this is because even the field having the scale of the hubble radius at temperature @xmath458 gev is correlated at the comoving scale @xmath459 mpc @xcite .",
    "however , the scale of intergalactic magnetic fields was determined to be of the order @xmath460 mpc @xcite .",
    "the fields generated at the ewpt can serve as seeds for long - range magnetic fields inside galaxies .",
    "now we discuss the scale of the field generated in the restored phase @xcite .",
    "this is a key point in relating expressions like eqs .",
    "( [ fieldt1 ] ) or ( [ bewsm ] ) with @xmath435 . in our consideration , the  frozen in \" condition was used .",
    "so , let us discuss its applicability in more detail .",
    "remind , if one assumes that after the ewpt the constant field @xmath454 was frozen in the plasma at the hubble scale , @xmath461 , then its comoving coherence scale at present has to be @xmath462 pc @xcite .",
    "this is much smaller than necessary .",
    "we consider two , in fact related , ways to overcome such a difficulty @xcite .",
    "the first is to take into consideration the reheating stage of the universe evolution .",
    "according to the concepts of modern cosmology @xcite , this stage has existed just after inflation and was related with the latter causal stage .",
    "just due to causality , the temperature in the universe after this stage is the same , in all domains of space , which could even be uncorrelated in later moments of time .",
    "hence , at a given high temperature , @xmath463 , a magnetic field generated due to vacuum polarization has the same strength @xmath6 everywhere in the universe .",
    "formally , the field strength could have different directions , in either external or internal spaces .",
    "different kind of ( chromo)magnetic fields , of the type as in eq .",
    "( [ potentialb ] ) , can be spontaneously generated .",
    "their nature depends on a particular model considered and is therefore unknown , so far .",
    "but this is not essential for our consideration , here . the magnetic fields coherent on huge scales have been present in the early universe .",
    "the origin of this coherence is ensured by the properties of the solution to the field equations ( eq .",
    "( [ potentialb ] ) ) and by causality at the inflationary epoch .",
    "the scales of the coherent field domains could be estimated on grounds of the gauge invariance .",
    "this idea , due to feynman , was put in force in gluodynamics with the goal to determine possible magnetic vacuum structures @xcite .",
    "namely , to find a gauge invariant vacuum , on the basis of gauge non - invariant solutions ( such as eq .",
    "( [ potentialb ] ) ) , one can consider a domain structure ensuring gauge invariance when a corresponding boundary is going around . at @xmath27 ,",
    "this point requires further investigation .",
    "most of fields generated in the early universe decouple and are screened at some energy ( temperature ) scales , when the corresponding scalar condensates have broken the background symmetries .",
    "so , the only unbroken symmetry at the ewpt remains the @xmath464 one . after the ewpt , when spontaneous magnetization stops , this field",
    "can not be included in turbulent processes generated by the transition .",
    "this is because the scale of the field , eq .  ( [ potentialb ] ) , is already much larger than any largest eddy of turbulence .",
    "as it is usually believed , the size of a typical eddy is estimated as the inverse mass of the particles appearing after the transition @xcite .",
    "thus , the field evolves in accordance with the metric expansion and is implemented in a hot plasma , thus fulfilling the magnetic flux conservation law .",
    "and it finally results in the present day intergalactic magnetic fields which could be correlated on @xmath254 mpc scales . note that an essential information on the processes that take place after the ewpt , obtained in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics , is given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "another possible scenario is based on the stochastic processes considered already by hogan @xcite in connection with the magnetic fields generated at first - order ewpt .",
    "a possible mechanism of field generation in that case was proposed by vachaspati @xcite . in the former paper , it was pointed out that magnetic fields correlated on large scales can be produced not only through causal processes but also by a stochastic random walk mechanism , if the magnetic lines generated in some domain of space  forget \" about their origin .",
    "the field strength developed on large scales by this process ( due to  straightening \" of entangled magnetic fields ) can be estimated as @xmath465 , where @xmath466 counts the number of domains , with the field @xmath20 of a given size , crossed by a magnetic line .",
    "the correlation length @xmath467 in this case can be much larger than the @xmath468 .",
    "it can be estimated as @xmath469 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been also noticed that this mechanism is not applicable to the early universe , the reason being because magnetic lines do not penetrate freely though the plasma .",
    "this is really the case , if the general properties of the plasma are taken into account .",
    "however , this is not the case if spontaneous vacuum magnetization is accounted for . in fact , at a given temperature , each uncorrelated domain of space having a hubble radius @xmath470 is filled up with a constant magnetic field @xmath6 , described by the potential ( [ potentialb ] ) .",
    "its orientation in both external and internal spaces is arbitrary .",
    "hence , a stochastic behavior of the field lines and the appearance of magnetic fields having large correlation lengths @xmath471 are expected .",
    "after the ewpt , these fields evolve as in the previous case .",
    "note that , in both scenarios , all the fields generated at the inflation epoch @xcite are washed out by the vacuum polarization and leave no remnants at present .",
    "the reheating stage becomes more important . in closing this section",
    ", we also remind that the long - range nature of the abelian spontaneously generated magnetic fields is ensured by their zero magnetic mass , what renders these fields unscreened , as is the case for usual @xmath4 magnetic fields . the difference",
    ", however , is essential because the former fields appear due to vacuum polarization and the latter ones need currents to be produced .",
    "we here summarize our main results .",
    "we have determined the characteristic parameters of chromomagnetic fields at high temperature - debye s and magnetic masses - in analytic and numeric approaches and obtained the coinciding results .",
    "qualitatively , we showed that the debye mass of gauge fields in strong magnetic fields at high temperature is decreased as compared to the zero field case and therefore electric fields are more long range ones .",
    "the magnetic mass of abelian chromomagnetic fields was found to be zero .",
    "so , these fields have to occupy all the space as usual @xmath4 magnetic field .",
    "this property is very important for cosmology . in particular , for generation of long rang magnetic fields in the early universe .",
    "the spontaneous vacuum magnetization process eliminates the magnetic flux conservation principle at high temperature .",
    "vacuum polarization is responsible for the value of the field strength @xmath6 at each temperature and serves as its source .",
    "physically , the magnetization is a consequence of the large magnetic moment of charged gauge bosons ( gyromagnetic ratio @xmath14 ) .",
    "this is one of the basic properties of matter .",
    "in fact , at high temperature , due to spin interaction of the virtual pairs , heat is converted into an ordered coherent vacuum state .",
    "this effect was not taken into consideration in previous studies of the early universe .",
    "we have shown here that , at finite temperature and after symmetry breaking , a scalar field condensate suppresses the magnetization .",
    "hence , it follows that the actual nature of the model extending the standard one is _ not _ that essential at sufficiently low temperatures , when the decoupling of the heavy gauge fields has occurred . from this one",
    "can conclude , in particular , that the vacuum polarization `` washes out '' the relics of the magnetic fields generated at very high temperature or at the inflation stage .",
    "this is because different kinds of magnetic fields existed at high temperatures were screened with temperature lowering , and the magnetic flux conservation does not hold at @xmath0 .",
    "after the ewpt , when the solution @xmath61 is realized , the spontaneous vacuum magnetization stops and the field evolves further according to the magnetic flux conservation law .",
    "the correlation length of the field is very large . at the ewpt",
    ", the field can be considered as constant magnetic field having the strength @xmath472 g. this value is not large and the field not essentially influences various processes happening after the transition .",
    "this is because , according to the estimates in  @xcite , the stochastic magnetic fields generated in a first order phase transition are much stronger , @xmath473 g. the scale of these fields is of the order of inverse particle mass , @xmath474 .",
    "recall that after reheating , the temperature in the hot universe is the same everywhere ( even in the domains of space which are uncorrelated in later periods of time ) .",
    "analogous statement concerns the values of @xmath6 which are strictly related with the temperature due to the vacuum polarization .",
    "most magnetic fields existed at high temperatures were screened with the temperature lowering when the corresponding symmetries have been spontaneously broken .",
    "the only magnetic field at the temperatures close @xmath8 is the @xmath17 component described by the potential ( [ potentialb ] ) .",
    "the present value of the intergalactic magnetic field strength , @xmath435 , we related with the field in the restored phase .",
    "because of the zero magnetic mass for abelian magnetic fields , there is no problem for the generation of fields having large coherence scales . in our estimates , we have assumed that , basically , the field is of the order of the horizon scale , @xmath428 .",
    "this seems reasonable because , at a given temperature , the field @xmath475 , generated due to vacuum polarization , occupies all space . then coherence on scales exceeding that of the horizon can be produced .",
    "such large scale fields are not influenced by turbulent processes happening after the ewpt .",
    "they are frozen in the plasma and evolve according to the magnetic flux conservation law . in this scenario ,",
    "a large scale domain structure is also permissible , what requires additional consideration .    as we have found above , the field strengths at the ewpt temperature , estimated with account to the present - day value of the intergalactic magnetic field strength , @xmath476 g , eq .",
    "( [ bew ] ) , or either directly from the vacuum magnetization in the standard model , eq .",
    "( [ bewsm ] ) , differ in six orders of magnitude .",
    "this huge deviation can be explained by the different scales of the fields considered .",
    "let us check this possibility by using the second of the scenarios proposed in the previous section , for large scale field generation .",
    "we used the usual relation between the scale factor and the temperature , @xmath477 taken at the ewpt epoch , and the present - day parameters , @xmath478 , @xmath479 . if one now assumes that @xmath480 , then from ( [ a - t ] ) it follows that @xmath462 ps . on the other hand ,",
    "if one takes @xmath481 mpc , the value @xmath482 mpc is obtained . at the same time , the horizon size is @xmath483 mpc , thus , @xmath484 .",
    "now , following an idea of hogan @xcite , we relate the size of the correlated field with the random walk process . at @xmath8",
    ", we have @xmath485 , hence , we get roughly @xmath486 , and for the field strength  straightened \" on the @xmath466-domain scale , @xmath487 @xcite .",
    "therefore , accounting for the field strength value calculated for the standard model , eq .",
    "( [ bewsm ] ) , we obtain @xmath488 g",
    "( the subscript in @xmath489 means  large scale \" ) .",
    "this value is close the value @xmath490 g estimated in eq .",
    "( [ bew ] ) .",
    "the remaining discrepancy can be explained in two ways .",
    "first , and obviously , as due to the roughness of our estimate .",
    "second , and more radically , by the necessity of substituting the standard model with another one .",
    "the latter point will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "let us note a number of properties of the field under consideration , and compare them with the ones usually discussed in applications of magnetohydrodynamics to the early universe . here",
    ", we follow refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite which are close to our analysis .",
    "first , we mention that the field energy density , @xmath491 , is proportional to @xmath492 , what is much smaller than the radiation energy density , @xmath493 .",
    "thus , the bbn condition ( see @xcite ) , @xmath494 , is fulfilled .",
    "second , as numerical simulations show @xcite , the turbulent process in the early universe with magnetic field included is slower than in the laboratory .",
    "turbulence can include a large scale field at the level of the largest eddies . for large scale fields ,",
    "the free decay stage is important . at this epoch , which is strongly dependent on the initial conditions",
    "@xcite , turbulence is significantly decreasing , and after this very brief stage the field is not affected by turbulence any more .",
    "it is just frozen in the plasma .",
    "as we have shown , the spontaneous vacuum magnetization is stopped when the first - order phase transition ends .",
    "that is , just after the free decay stage .",
    "fields of this type can not be influenced by turbulence and thus it is reasonable to believe that after the ewpt the field evolves according to eq .",
    "( [ b3 t ] ) .",
    "note also that these fields are non - helical ones .",
    "now , we compare our results with those of  @xcite , where spontaneous vacuum magnetization at high temperature was applied to estimate the field strength at the planck era . in that paper , to estimate the value @xmath6 the heterotic superstring theory @xmath495 was considered as the basic model . at the planck era",
    ", the magnetic field strength has been estimated to be of order @xmath496 .",
    "in contrast to our considerations , it was assumed there that the magnetic field approximately scales as @xmath497 .",
    "that is , vacuum magnetization was taken into account only at the very first moments of the evolution .",
    "further , recent results deriving a zero magnetic mass for the abelian chromomagnetic fields also change the picture of the magnetized early universe substantially . according to this",
    ", the created magnetic fields existed on the horizon scales .",
    "they were switched of at some mass scales .",
    "the processes of decoupling were also not taken into consideration in  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is impossible there to relate the magnetic field @xmath435 with the magnetic fields generated at high temperatures .    in the used approach",
    ", knowing the particular properties of the extended model , it is possible to estimate the field strengths at any temperature .",
    "this can be done for different schemes of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( restoration ) by taking into account the fact that , after the decoupling of some massive gauge fields , the corresponding magnetic fields are screened .",
    "thus , the higher the temperature , the larger the number of strong long - range magnetic fields of different types that will be generated in the early universe . to estimate their field strengths at higher temperatures",
    ", one has to take into consideration a number of features proper to the standard model and its particular extension at play .",
    "first , we note that quarks possess both electric and color charges .",
    "therefore , there is a mixing between the color and usual magnetic fields owing to the quark loops .",
    "second , there are peculiarities related with the particular content of the extended models . for example , in the two - higgs - doublet standard model the contribution @xmath498 in eq .",
    "( [ vw ] ) is exactly canceled by the corresponding term in eq .",
    "( [ vscalar ] ) , because of the four charged scalar fields entering the model .",
    "they interact with gauge fields with the same coupling constant .",
    "however , in this model the doublets interact differently with fermions .",
    "this changes the effective couplings of the doublets with the gauge fields and results in non - complete cancelations . as a result",
    ", a suppression of the spontaneously created magnetic field is expected in this model . in principle",

    "note also that in the minimal supersymmetric standard model the field @xmath6 generated at high temperature is smaller then in the standard model @xcite .",
    "so , formally , it can also be considered as a candidate for explanation of intergalactic magnetic fields . however ,",
    "this case is not well studied , now .",
    "there can be other peculiarities which may influence the high temperature phase of the universe .    as conclusion",
    "we note that the spontaneous vacuum magnetization at high temperature could find other interesting applications in cosmology .",
    "another phenomenons of interest may be the deconfinement phase transition with accounting for both magnetic @xmath6 and color chromomagnetic fields @xmath499 .",
    "the situation here may differ from described above because gluons are massless and spontaneously generated color magnetic field has to exist till deconfinement temperature @xmath38 .",
    "these require further investigations .",
