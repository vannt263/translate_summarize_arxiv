    "they did find a few peaks around 600 that agreed with the    ground - based data , but they also identified eight of the many peaks at    much lower frequency ( 130500 ) , in the region of rising power , as    being due to low - overtone p - modes .",
    "those peaks do line up quite well    with the regular 40 spacing , but extreme caution is needed before    these peaks are accepted as genuine .",
