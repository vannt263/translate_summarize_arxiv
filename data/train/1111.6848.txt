[ figuur1 ]        a connected subset of an interface curve delimited by a starting and an ending point will be called an _ interface segment_.    we continue with some general definitions concerning curves , mostly taken from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "let @xmath294 , and perform the fractal process until level @xmath295 ( inclusive ) .",
    "the annulus @xmath293 consists of 12 level-@xmath295 squares ( figure [ figuurtje ] ) , some of which are in @xmath296 and some of which are not . now observe that the collection of black ( retained ) squares of level @xmath295 in @xmath293 is partitioned into at most 6  level-@xmath295 components \" , where two neighbouring retained level-@xmath295 squares are in the same component if they share an edge : see figure [ figuurtje ] for an illustration of the event that the annulus contains 3 such level-@xmath295 components .",
    "[ figuurtje ]     with 3 level-@xmath295 components , drawn in dark grey.,width=302 ]    now let @xmath290 be large enough ( exactly how large will become clear soon ) .",
    "if @xmath293 is , after @xmath25 iterations , crossed by @xmath290 disjoint interface segments , then at least one of the level-@xmath295 components must be crossed by at least @xmath297 such segments , since there are at most 6 components to accomodate these crossings ( we should write @xmath298 but we ignore these details for the sake of notational convenience ) . between the interface crossings , one has alternating black ( retained ) and white ( discarded ) crossings of the annulus .",
    "this implies that the component with at least @xmath297 interface crossings is , after @xmath25 iterations , also crossed by at least @xmath299 white crossings which are  between \" the  first \" and  last \" of the @xmath297 interface crossings of said component .",
    "the point of considering the level-@xmath295 components introduced above is that they are disjoint and separated by vacant squares , so that the fractal constructions inside them from level @xmath295 on are independent of each other , and none of the interface segments crossing @xmath293 can intersect more than one of them . therefore , adding extra retained level-@xmath295 squares in @xmath293 does not affect the @xmath299 white crossings in the component with at least @xmath297 interface crossings .",
    "this implies that the probability of having at least @xmath290 interface crossings in @xmath293 after @xmath25 iterations is bounded above by the probability of having at least @xmath299 white crossings after @xmath25 iterations , conditioned on having full retention in @xmath293 up to level @xmath295 .",
    "however , scaling tells us that , if we condition on retention until level @xmath295 , the probability in question is the same as the probability of having at least @xmath299 disjoint white components crossing @xmath300 when we perform @xmath301 iterations of the fractal process in @xmath302 ^ 2 $ ] rather than in @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] , seen as the union of 16 independent fractal processes on the 16 unit squares making up @xmath302 ^ 2 $ ] .",

    "this then finally leads to the estimate that @xmath303 is bounded above by @xmath304    if there is a white component crossing @xmath305 , then there is no black circuit surrounding the origin in @xmath305 .",
    "the probability of having such a black circuit after @xmath301 iterations is at least as large as the probability to have such a circuit in the limit , and by the weak rsw theorem for fractal percolation in @xcite and the fkg inequality , we have that for @xmath275 this probability is strictly positive .",

    "we can treat this conditional probability exactly as above : we can change the conditioning into one involving complete retention inside @xmath308 until level @xmath310 , to get an upper bound .",
    "it follows that the probability that both @xmath293 and @xmath308 have @xmath290 interface crossings is bounded above by the square of the individual bounds , that is , by @xmath311 .",
