    "our interests in the study of hadron spectroscopy are strongly motivated by the speculation of exotic hadrons of which the very existence is implicated by qcd . during the past decades , the search for exotic hadrons has been one of the most important physics goals at high - energy experimental facilities , such as tevatron ( cdf and d@xmath10 ) , b - factories ( belle and babar ) and electron storage rings at cleo and bes - iii .",
    "although confirmed evidence for exotics is still lacking , experimental measurements have brought a lot of surprises during the past few years . in the charmonium sector , a number of new resonance - like signals have been observed by the b - factories  @xcite , and some of them exhibit peculiar decay modes which could be an indication for their being exotic hadrons  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it should also be cautioned that some of those enhancements observed in experiment may not be genuine resonances . to identify those non - resonant structures and understand the underlying dynamics for their production and decays are of great importance for the study of hadron spectroscopy and gaining insights into the strong qcd .",
    "the most updated summary of those newly - discovered resonance - like states can be found in the recent review article  @xcite , among which the vector charmonium - like states are of our interests here .",
    "firstly , the vector charmonium spectrum is well established in both theory and experiment in the low mass region .",
    "it has been a success of the potential quark model that the light charmonium states can be well described by the one - gluon exchange and linear confinement potentials  @xcite .",
    "so far , nearly all the light charmonia below the @xmath11 open threshold have been discovered in experiment  @xcite .",
    "the measured masses are in good agreement with the quark model predictions which suggests that the massive charm quark is a good effective degrees of freedom in the description of the charmonium spectrum .",
    "secondly , an experimental advantage with the vector charmonium states is that they can be directly produced in @xmath7 annihilations .",
    "this would allow a direct measurement of these states in experiment . as a consequence",
    ", the data would impose an immediate test of theoretical calculations .",
    "restricted to the vector charmonium sector , the experimental observations have turned out to be surprising .",
    "the first unexpected result was the observation of the charmonium - like vector @xmath12 in its decay into @xmath13 by babar in the initial state radiation ( isr ) process .",
    "it was later confirmed by belle and cleo .",
    "meanwhile , several other charmonium - like vector states , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , were observed in the same isr process and the same @xmath13 invariant spectrum .",
    "there have been tremendous theoretical interpretations for these states in the literature .",
    "some of those states are proposed to be exotic candidates for which a detailed review can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our focus in this proceeding is not on those above mentioned resonant structures .",
    "instead , we are interested in an enhancement , the so - called @xmath8   in ref .  @xcite . ] , observed in the isr process by belle in @xmath17  @xcite . the peak position of this enhancement is located at @xmath18 mev with a width of @xmath19 mev .",
    "several peculiar aspects make this structure extremely interesting and deserves to be studied in detail : i ) in the vicinity of the @xmath8 mass region , there is no vector charmonium state predicted in the potential quark model .",
    "one notices that the nearby quark model states are @xmath20 and @xmath21 which fit well in the @xmath22 spectrum .",
    "this feature immediately implies that this structure can not be easily accommodated by the quark model classifications .",
    "ii ) a natural speculation is that such an enhancement is due to the @xmath1 open threshold as anticipated by eichten _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite long time ago .",
    "however , theoretical description of the open threshold effects has suffered a lot from model - dependence .",
    "thus , solid evidence that confirms the dynamical origin of @xmath8 is still desired .    in this proceeding",
    ", we report our recent progress on the study of the open threshold effects in @xmath0 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we will show that model - independent evidence can be reached for the @xmath1 open threshold in @xmath25 . as a consequence , it would be possible to stab the @xmath8 as the first evidence for the open threshold enhancement observed in experiment .",
    "it should be mentioned that the belle collaboration also reported their measurement of the cross section lineshape of @xmath27  @xcite . the same channels were also measured by the babar collaboration  @xcite which appeared to be consistent with the belle data . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a threshold enhancement is observed in the cross section around @xmath28 gev , which provides an important evidence for the role played by the @xmath1 open threshold . by fitting the data of ref .",
    "@xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we show that the @xmath29 form factor can be extracted based on the following two parameterizations :    \\(i ) form factor one ( ff - i ) for the @xmath29 coupling : @xmath30 } + g_0 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 corresponds to the @xmath1 threshold , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are fitting parameters .",
    "\\(ii ) form factor two ( ff - ii ) for the @xmath29 coupling : @xmath35 with a background term @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 can be regarded as the product of the @xmath38 coupling and the @xmath39 coupling .",
    "the fitted parameters in these two parametrization schemes are listed in table .",
    "[ ff - para ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] by the dashed line , ff - i can perfectly describe the energy dependence of the effective coupling , and be extrapolated to the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "the dotted line indicates that the ff - ii agrees with the data at higher energies , but drops at the threshold region . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the structure of @xmath8 in @xmath26 can be well described after taking into account the @xmath1 open threshold effects  @xcite .",
    "however , one should realize that the open threshold effects are not the unique explanation for the structure of @xmath8 .",
    "it can also be explained by a breit - wigner distribution as shown by the parametrization of ff - ii .",
    "so the key question is , how would one be able to elucidate that the @xmath8 is caused by the @xmath1 open threshold ?",
    "the answer to this question may possibly come from reaction channel @xmath40 as to be discussed later .",
    "nevertheless , correlated processes including @xmath41 and @xmath24 would also bring additional information which can be examined in experiment .    .",
    "parameters fitted with ff - i and ff - ii for the @xmath42 effective coupling form factor .",
    "the data are from belle  @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     schematic diagrams for @xmath43 via charmed @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) meson loops .",
    "the diagrams for the @xmath24 mode are similar . ]",
    "schematic diagrams for @xmath43 via charmed @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) meson loops .",
    "the diagrams for the @xmath24 mode are similar . ]",
    "recall that the position of the @xmath8 is located between the known @xmath3 and @xmath4 , its coupling to @xmath23 and isospin - violating @xmath47 would receive relatively small interferences from the nearby resonances .",
    "therefore , peculiar threshold effects due to the open @xmath1 might be detectable in @xmath48 and @xmath47 and distinguish this structure from a resonance nature . apart from this anticipation",
    ", we also consider the @xmath24 channel , of which the threshold is very close to the @xmath1    as we know from the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model , light vector meson contributions to the cross sections are negligible in the charmonium energy region .",
    "the main resonance contributions are from vector charmonium excitations .",
    "note that the final states @xmath49 consist of a charmonium plus a light meson .",
    "therefore , the transitions are okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule violating processes , which should be dominated by soft mechanisms near threshold .",
    "since the pure electromagnetic ( em ) transitions are negligibly small , a natural way to recognize the soft mechanisms for @xmath50 , @xmath47 and @xmath24 is via the open charm transitions which are illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "similar approach has been applied to the study of the cross section lineshape of @xmath51 in the vicinity of the @xmath52 meson mass region  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangians for the coupling vertices involving charmonia and charmed mesons are extracted from heavy quark effective theory and chiral symmetry as applied in ref .",
    "they are written as follows : @xmath53 + h.c.,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 denotes the @xmath55-wave charmonium states , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the charmed and anti - charmed meson triplet , respectively .",
    "the lagrangian describing the interactions between light meson and charmed mesons reads @xmath58+igtr[h_i\\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_5a^\\mu_{ij}\\bar{h}_j]+i\\beta tr[h_iv^\\mu(v_\\mu-\\rho_\\mu)_{ij}\\bar{h}_j ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & i\\lambda tr[h_i\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\mu\\nu}(\\rho)_{ij}\\bar{h}_j ] , \\label{vph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath59 with @xmath60 , and @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the light pseudoscalar octet and vector nonet , respectively  @xcite .    with the above lagrangians ,",
    "the leading order couplings are given as follows  @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the levi - civita tensor and @xmath44 meson field destroys a @xmath44 meson .",
    "all the coupling values have been given explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this study , we include five resonances , i.e. @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath68 which are the dominant ones near the @xmath1 threshold .    as mentioned earlier , the reactions @xmath41 , @xmath47 , and @xmath24 via vector charmonium states ( denoted as @xmath69 ) involve light hadron productions via soft gluon exchanges .",
    "therefore , they are generally ozi - rule suppressed . in refs .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the intermediate meson loops ( iml ) are relative enhanced in comparison with the soft gluon exchanges for @xmath70 and @xmath47 . as a consequence , the iml provide an mechanism to evade the ozi rule . nevertheless , it is also an important mechanism for causing strong isospin violations in e.g. @xmath71 .",
    "the reactions @xmath41 and @xmath47 are correlated with each other as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "firstly , the meson loop amplitudes can be separated into two classes , i.e. charged intermediate meson loops ( ciml ) and neutral intermediate meson loops ( niml ) . in the isospin symmetry limit ,",
    "i.e. @xmath72 , the absolute values of these two amplitudes are always equal to each other . in the isospin conserved channels , such as @xmath73",
    ", these two amplitudes would add to each other , while in the isospin - violating channels , such as @xmath74 , these two amplitudes would have different signs and thus cancel each other . in another word , in the isospin symmetry limit , the cross section via the intermediate meson loops would vanish in @xmath75 .    in reality , the isospin symmetry is broken , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , the masses of the charged and neutral @xmath77 mesons are different .",
    "this will lead to nonvanishing cross sections for @xmath75 due to the incomplete cancelations between the ciml and niml amplitudes . as a prediction for such a scenario",
    ", the residual cross sections will appear in between the charged and neutral @xmath78 thresholds and produce two cusps at the thresholds of @xmath79 mev and @xmath80 mev .",
    "namely , the mechanism that causes the cross section enhancement between those two thresholds is also responsible for the @xmath8 observed in @xmath26  @xcite .     in terms of the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath81 with different phase angles  @xcite .",
    "the vertical lines labels the open charm thresholds . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the calculated cross section for @xmath25 in terms of the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath81 is presented .",
    "although the cross section is rather sensitive to the relative phases introduced among the transition amplitudes , the peak structure @xmath8 has a model - independent feature and can be searched for in experiment .",
    "more importantly , since the thresholds of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are isolated from the known @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the enhancement here would be a clear evidence for non - resonant peaks in @xmath7 annihilations .",
    "in contrast , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the @xmath84 loops have relatively large contributions to the cross sections in @xmath41 , their contributions are submerged by other amplitudes and can not be indisputably identified in the cross section lineshape .",
    "we also note that the @xmath67 has a predominant contribution to @xmath85 due to its strong isospin violation couplings via the @xmath44 meson loops  @xcite",
    ". such a resonant enhancement should be detectable , and the cross section measurement will provide a calibration for the @xmath8 structure .    it should be pointed out that the @xmath8 as the open charm effect is a collective one from the @xmath84 loops to which all the vector charmonia have contributions .",
    "that is why such a @xmath86 wave configuration between @xmath84 can produce the significant enhancement in @xmath46 .",
    "this mechanism is much likely to be different from the @xmath87 , which has been broadly investigated in the literature as a dynamically generated @xmath84 bound state in the relative @xmath55 wave .",
    "detailed results for @xmath41 and @xmath24 can be found in ref .",
    "in summary , we have proposed to study the coupled channel effects in @xmath7 annihilating to @xmath23 , @xmath47 and @xmath24 . in particular , we show that the reaction @xmath40 will be extremely interesting for disentangling the resonance contributions and open charm effects taking the advantage that the open @xmath78 threshold is relatively isolated from the nearby known charmonia @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "although we also find that the predicted cross sections are rather sensitive to the model parameters adopted , we clarify that the open charm effects from the @xmath1 channel are rather model - independent .",
    "therefore , it is extremely interesting to search for the predicted enhancement around 3.876 gev ( i.e. @xmath8 ) in experiment .",
    "confirmation of this prediction would allow us to learn a lot about the nature of non - pqcd in the charmonium energy region , and provide insights into some of those long - standing puzzles in charmonium decays , such as the  @xmath63-@xmath88 puzzle \" and @xmath3 non-@xmath11 decays etc  @xcite .",
