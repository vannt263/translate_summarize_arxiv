    "<S> we report accurate energetics of defects introduced in gan on doping with divalent metals , focussing on the technologically important case of mg doping , using a model which takes into consideration both the effect of hole localisation and dipolar polarisation of the host material , and includes a well - defined reference level . </S>",
    "<S> defect formation and ionisation energies show that divalent dopants are counterbalanced in gan by nitrogen vacancies and not by holes , which explains both the difficulty in achieving @xmath0-type conductivity in gan and the associated major spectroscopic features , including the ubiquitous 3.46 ev photoluminescence line , a characteristic of all lightly divalent - metal - doped gan materials that has also been shown to occur in pure gan samples . </S>",
    "<S> our results give a comprehensive explanation for the observed behaviour of gan doped with low concentrations of divalent metals in good agreement with relevant experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> gallium nitride , a wide - gap semiconductor , is an important material used for a range of applications , e.g. solid state lighting , high power microelectronics , is an essential component of commercial blue light emitting diodes , which requires both @xmath1- and @xmath0-type conducting layers  @xcite . while it has been intensively researched for several decades </S>",
    "<S> , many puzzling features still remain . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , gan is natively @xmath1-type , indicating the presence of shallow donors , but whether these centres are native point defects ( e.g. nitrogen vacancies ) or unwanted impurities incorporated during growth ( such as hydrogen , oxygen or silicon ) remains a source of controversy  @xcite .    industrially , the production of @xmath0-type </S>",
    "<S> gan is still the main bottleneck . </S>",
    "<S> the only successful approach has been to dope with mg but there are many associated problems : large concentrations of mg close to the solubility limit , as well as processing such as thermal annealing or electron irradiation , are required to achieve significant @xmath0-type activation ; high dislocation densities limit hole mobilities ; there is a residual @xmath1-type concentration that must be overcome ; and self - compensation may limit activation  @xcite .    at low temperature ( @xmath2 ) , the band gap of gan is 3.503 ev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental techniques such as photoconductance , photoluminescence ( pl ) , and deep level transient spectroscopy indicate that the mg@xmath3 acceptor state lies @xmath4 ev above the valence band maximum ( vbm )  @xcite , corrobarated by theoretical studies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> with such a deep level , however , why mg - doping results in @xmath0-type conductivity is not well understood , although theories have been proposed involving defect complexes and hydrogen impurities  @xcite , with some experimental support  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar acceptor levels are found for other divalent dopants including zn , cd , be and sr  @xcite , but the lack of associated @xmath0-type activation , in contrast to mg , has not been explained .    adding small amounts of mg to gan leads to characteristic peaks in the uv range of the pl spectrum , at 3.27 ev and at 3.466 ev ( measured at @xmath2 = 2 k )  @xcite and in some samples a peak at @xmath5 ev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the peak at 3.466 ev is also observed in samples doped with other divalent cations  @xcite and is attributed to acceptor - bound excitons ( abes )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , there is some evidence that this peak occurs in nominally undoped gan samples  @xcite , indicating that it may instead relate to some compensating native shallow defect . when the mg content increases , the pl spectrum changes , becoming dominated by a broad peak at @xmath6 ev , corresponding to blue luminescence ( bl ) and attributed to donor - acceptor pairs ( daps )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bl has also been observed in samples when @xmath2 is raised , rather than the mg concentration ( [ mg ] )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far theory fails to account for the characteristic uv luminescence associated with small [ mg ] , but recombination processes have been proposed to account for bl and also red luminescence  @xcite , which is sometimes observed in heavily - doped samples .    </S>",
    "<S> recent thermal admittance spectroscopy ( tas ) measurements on epitaxially grown @xmath1-gan have found that the shallow donor level lies 51 mev below the conduction band minimum ( cbm )  @xcite , agreeing with older measurements using electron irradiation techniques  @xcite ( placing the level at @xmath7 mev below the cbm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this level is significantly deeper than those introduced when gan is intentionally doped @xmath1-type with e.g. si or o ( @xmath8 mev )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a shallow positive defect may act as a compensating centre for holes in gan , though this has not conclusively been shown to be the case .    in this letter , we present calculated formation and ionisation energies of nitrogen vacancies ( v@xmath9 ) and mg substituting on a ga site ( mg@xmath3 ) in gan in the dilute limit , using a multiscale embedded cluster approach . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the ionisation energies associated with the divalent substitutionals : be@xmath3 , zn@xmath3 , cd@xmath3 , and hg@xmath3 in the dilute limit . </S>",
    "<S> we find isolated mg@xmath3 do not contribute to @xmath0-type conductivity , instead they are compensated by v@xmath9 formation . </S>",
    "<S> the same result follows for the other divalent dopants considered . </S>",
    "<S> we find the v@xmath9 is a shallow donor at 44 mev below the cbm , accounting for the observed 3.466 ev pl peak , and is stable in the negative charge state , facilitating fermi level pinning close to ( and above ) the cbm and leading to native @xmath1-type conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we determine that the equilibrium mg@xmath3 level lies 0.307 ev above the vbm ; we also calculate related levels that depend on the hole configuration and final spin state after excitation , that , although are slightly less favorable , will be accessible in fast pl experiments and account for the main peaks observed at low @xmath2 and [ mg ] . </S>",
    "<S> the observed bl is related to excitation and recombination of ionised v@xmath9 , which will occur in greater concentrations at higher @xmath2 and [ mg ] , in agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we also find good agreement between our calculated ionisation energies for be , zn , cd , and hg impurities and relevant pl measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our results give a simple but comprehensive explanation to the observed native @xmath1-type conductivity , pl spectrum at low mg content , and the difficulty with @xmath0-type doping in gan .    </S>",
    "<S> we employed the hybrid quantum mechanical / molecular mechanical ( qm / mm ) embedded cluster method  @xcite to calculate bulk and defect energies in gan . in this approach , a defect ( possibly charged ) and its immediately surrounding region , of the order of 100 atoms , is treated using a qm level of theory - here using density functional theory ( dft ) with a triple - zeta - plus - polarisation gaussian basis set ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details ) and a hybrid exchange and correlation functional employing 42% exact exchange ( bb1k )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the qm region is embedded within a larger cluster , typically @xmath10 atoms , which is treated at a mm level of theory , using polarisable - shell interatomic potentials that accurately reproduce the dielectric , elastic , and structural properties of the bulk material  @xcite . thus one </S>",
    "<S> can model accurately isolated charged defects in any dimensionality  @xcite , fully accounting for the dielectric response from the surrounding material . </S>",
    "<S> as supercells are not employed , there is no need to correct for image - charge interactions . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , ionisation energies can be determined relative to a well - defined reference level , which we term the vacuum level ( although in reality it is a quasi - vacuum level , because surface effects are not included in the energetics ) . </S>",
    "<S> technical details , including the treatment of cluster termination and the interface between the qm and mm regions , are discussed elsewhere  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one caveat is that the defects modelled must be localised within the qm region , which , however , applies in the current case . </S>",
    "<S> this method was applied successfully to treat defects in zno  @xcite and band alignment in tio@xmath11  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> this energy changes to 0.783 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the axial hole energy is more favourable ( by 0.063 ev ) than that of the configuration with the hole localised on a n in the basal plane . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider mg@xmath26n@xmath11 as the source of mg , rather than mg metal , we obtain a higher formation energy of 2.375 ev ( 2.756 ev ) for anion - rich ( anion - poor ) conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy to dissociate a hole , according to the reaction : @xmath27 is highly unfavourable at 1.404 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this result differs from the low value of 0.26 ev obtained using periodic supercell models  @xcite , which may suffer from incomplete cancellation of the electron self - interaction  @xcite and treatment of long - range polarisation , as well as an absence of a well - defined reference  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our result , however , is consistent with earlier work on thermodynamical doping limits in gan  @xcite , which showed that free holes are unstable with respect to point defect formation ( agreeing with the natively @xmath1-type nature of gan ) . indeed , considering the compensation of holes by the formation of v@xmath9 : @xmath28 we determine a reaction energy of -1.245 ev , i.e. the balance is far to the right , indicating the thermodymical instability of holes . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , doping with low levels of mg will not result in free - hole formation , instead compensation by v@xmath9 will occur . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that our calculations apply to the dilute limit , under the assumption of thermodynamical equilibrium . for certain designs and/or synthetic procedures , where kinetic effects may dominate , or at higher [ mg ] , where the formation of complexes or phase segregated nanostructures may occur </S>",

    "<S> the vbm relative to the vacuum level is determined by considering ionisation of an electron from the bulk system . </S>",
    "<S> we include ionisation of mg@xmath12 and mg@xmath39 with both hole configurations ( i.e. with the hole localised on a basal plane n or axial n ) , as both should be accessible from electron excitation experiments such as pl . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reason , we include both possible final states , singlet and triplet , for the case of ionisation of mg@xmath12 . such ies correspond to emission energies of photoexcited electrons recombining with these defect levels , as would be observed in pl experiments , where , after excitation , atoms typically do not have adequate time to fully relax . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are in excellent agreement with the low @xmath2 and [ mg ] pl spectra observed experimentally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce well the dap pl peaks at 3.21 and 3.27 ev ,  @xcite and the abe peak at 3.466 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the 2.75 ev ie of mg@xmath40 , although in approximate agreement with the observed bl peak , is unlikely to be observed due to its high formation energy ( 1.404 ev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the vertical ies of v@xmath9 are , similar to the case of mg@xmath3 , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ion ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that v@xmath41 is a shallow donor , having a vertical ie at 44 mev below the cbm , in good agreement with measurements using tas and electron irradiation techniques  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this level may also account for the 3.46 ev pl peak observed in a wide range of divalently - doped and undoped gan samples  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> v@xmath33 is also stable and shallow with a vertical ie 52 mev below the cbm . </S>",
    "<S> the stability and near degeneracy of the v@xmath41 and v@xmath33 states facilitates fermi level pinning near the cbm . </S>",
    "<S> when the v@xmath9 donates electrons and relaxes to its equilibrium configurations , the resulting ies are deep , and in excellent agreement with the 2.95 ev bl peak that is observed at higher [ mg ] and at higher @xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we associate these levels with the bl as there will be more ionised v@xmath9 present at higher @xmath2 and also at higher [ mg ] due to an increased number of compensating v@xmath9 .     </S>",

    "<S> the agreement is good . </S>",
    "<S> for all cases there is an observed 3.46 ev peak , but only for the cases of be@xmath3 and mg@xmath3 can we attribute it to an abe . for the other dopants we attribute the peak to the compensating v@xmath9 ( which may also play a role in be and mg doping ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore arrive at a simple explanation for what occurs when mg or other divalent metal dopants are added to gan in small concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> isolated mg@xmath3 strongly trap holes and , therefore , do not contribute to @xmath0-type conduction , instead hole carriers will be compensated by the formation of v@xmath9 , a result that follows for other divalent metal dopants  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the v@xmath9 are shallow donors , with the near degeneracy of the neutral and negative charge states pinning the fermi level close to the cbm , giving rise to the native @xmath1-type conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated ies are in excellent agreement with the relevant pl spectra . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the v@xmath9 level can give rise to the 3.46 ev peak observed in a wide range of doped and undoped samples , as it will be present as a compensating centre ( for the case of mg and be doping the 3.46 ev peak can also be attributed to abes , which for mg doping agrees with experiment  @xcite ) . a comprehensive description of pl and conductivity phenomena in gan lightly - doped with mg , </S>",
    "<S> be , zn , cd , and hg is thus provided , without the need to propose , in the technologically significant case of mg doping in particular , clustering of mg@xmath3 and v@xmath9 , or h impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the latter may , however , play an important role in heavily - doped gan , which is less well characterised or understood . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature of such a material is the presence of inverted mg - rich pyramidal domains  @xcite , which could trap interstitial n , making vacancy formation unfavourable , and lead to lower hole ionisation potentials . </S>",
    "<S> such hypotheses , however , require apropriate investigation and are beyond the scope of this study .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have comprehensively studied defect formation associated with divalent metal doping in gan , using a multiscale approach . </S>",
    "<S> our results explain in detail the process , by which low levels of divalent dopants are compensated by v@xmath9 , and are in excellent agreement with available pl experimental data . </S>"
