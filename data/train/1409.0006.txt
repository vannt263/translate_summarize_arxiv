    "the association of core - collapse supernovae ( sne , including types ii and ibc ) with the death of massive stars is now firmly established both theoretically and observationally .",
    "massive stars with initial mass between @xmath8 and @xmath1 evolve into red supergiants ( rsg ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with extended envelopes that give rise to their spectral identification as hydrogen - rich type ii sne upon core collapse .",
    "higher mass stars that shed their outer envelopes evolve into naked helium or wolf - rayet stars ( wr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that eventually explode as hydrogen - free type ibc sne .",
    "the transition from rsg to wr is expected to be a gradual one in mass , since metallicity , rotation , and binary mass transfer also significantly affect evolution .",
    "nevertheless , observational estimates of the initial mass required to evolve into a wr is @xmath9 @xcite , consistent with the maximum rsg mass .",
    "theoretical studies also find the mass required for a single solar - metallicity star to shed its hydrogen envelope to be just above @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the link between rsgs and type iip sne has been firmly established by advances in archival imaging of pre - sn progenitors @xcite .",
    "although similar strategies have not yet positively identified the progenitors of type ibc sne , studies indicate the need for a significant contribution of binary stars to the type ibc sn progenitor population @xcite .",
    "advances have also revealed new puzzles .",
    "@xcite identified what they termed the `` rsg problem '' , which refers to the unknown fate of the most massive rsgs .",
    "based on @xmath11 type iip sne with pre - images , the authors statistically derived an upper mass for type iip sn progenitors of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 at @xmath14%c.l . ) , which falls short of the mass range of rsg populations that extend up to @xmath9 .",
    "numerous explanations have been considered .",
    "for example , if the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is steeper , the null observation of massive rsg progenitors becomes statistically less significant @xcite . or , the loosely bound hydrogen envelopes of the most massive rsgs may become unstable and lost immediately prior to core collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "pre - sn mass loss could also bias progenitor mass estimates to lower values due to insufficient dust correction ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) . or",
    ", stellar evolution may limit the rsg mass to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "finally , under certain conditions massive stars collapse to black holes ( bh ) with optically dark or faint `` failed sne '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may occur in the upper rsg mass range @xcite .",
    "another puzzle is the apparent dearth of observed cosmic sne when compared to expectations from the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) , termed the `` sn rate problem '' @xcite .",
    "the mismatch is a factor of @xmath16 and consistently observed at all redshifts where cosmic sn rate data are available , except in the local @xmath17(10 ) mpc regime @xcite .",
    "possible explanations involve a large fraction of optically dim sne @xcite , updates to the sfr calibrations @xcite , and updates to dust corrections of sfr data @xcite .",
    "the picture is therefore more complex than a simplistic one where all massive stars evolve as single isolated stars and explode as luminous sne . in this letter",
    ", we investigate the success or failure of massive - star core collapse by focusing on the rsg and sn rate problems within a common theoretical framework using the `` compactness '' parameter , which quantifies the mass density structure of the sn progenitor .",
    "the importance of the compactness is well documented ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially in predicting the success or failure of core collapse @xcite .",
    "in particular , stars in the mass range @xmath3@xmath1 have large compactness , thus providing a solution to the rsg problem @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we show that the failed sn scenario naturally provides an explanation of the rsg and sn rate problems , and we use a series of two - dimensional numerical hydrodynamics simulations of core collapse , as well as state - of - the - art three - dimensional simulations , to support this scenario .    the letter is organized as follows . in section [ sec : problems ] , we discuss the rsg and sn rate problems within a common framework of compactness . in section [ sec : sim ] , we discuss our hydrodynamics simulations and implications for the rsg and sn rate problems .",
    "we conclude with discussions in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the compactness encodes structural properties of the progenitor that critically affects whether the star will explode as a sn or not .",
    "it is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radial coordinate that encloses a baryonic mass @xmath20 at epoch @xmath21 .",
    "the compactness is a measure of the shape of the mass density profile surrounding the iron core : the slower the density profile drop with radius , the larger the compactness . a shallower density gradient results in a larger accretion rate and hence ram pressure that a sn shock must overcome in order to turn what is initially an implosion into an explosion",
    ". progenitors with higher compactness are therefore more difficult to explode ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt @xmath22 at @xmath23 , i.e. , the pre - sn epoch . while other definitions are possible , we find that @xmath24 is sufficiently larger than the iron core mass but deep enough in the progenitor to affect the accretion rate during the critical moments of sn shock revival . as we demonstrate in section [ sec : sim ]",
    ", it shows a remarkable correlation with the qualitative result of the collapse , in particular in the vicinity of the parameter space for explosion failures .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , where the compactness defined by @xmath24 mass enclosed at time of bounce was used to distinguish between collapse to a neutron star ( ns ) or bh .",
    "@xcite have shown how the compactness at the pre - sn epoch is just as useful as an indicator as the compactness derived at the time of core bounce .",
    "therefore , we proceed to define the compactness at the pre - sn epoch and label this @xmath4 .",
    "the rsg problem in the language of compactness is illustrated in the top panel of fig [ fig : compactness ] , where @xmath4 is shown as a function of the initial progenitor mass , for the solar metallicity models of @xcite ( whw02 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath4 depends non - monotonically on mass , and in particular , a peak exists between @xmath11@xmath1 .",
    "the physics that determine the compactness is discussed in depth by @xcite , and involves the detailed burning history of the star .",
    "the peak is driven partly by smaller mass progenitors forming degenerate compact white dwarf - like cores that drive the compactness lower , but also by the disappearance of the first carbon shell burning in progenitors above @xmath15 which increases the compactness since subsequent shell burnings are pulled down . while the exact features of @xmath4 are sensitive to the way semiconvection , convective overshooting , and mass loss are modelled , the qualitative peak features in mass are seen in multiple simulation codes @xcite . the shaded vertical column is the mass range of the rsg problem , i.e. , @xmath25@xmath26 @xcite : these stars are missing from type iip sn progenitor searches . therefore , massive stars with compactness above a critical value @xmath27 would need to not explode as canonically luminous type iip sne .",
    "the sn rate problem can be framed in terms of @xmath4 by estimating the fraction of all massive stars that have @xmath4 above some critical value .",
    "physically , this fraction is interpreted as massive stars whose core density profile make it difficult to explode as canonical sne , and is equivalent to an optically dim or dark sn fraction . defining massive stars as @xmath28@xmath29 stars",
    ", we derive this fraction for three imfs @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , shown in the bottom panel of fig [ fig : compactness ] .",
    "we quantify the sn rate problem using the latest data sets .",
    "the @xmath34 sfr density is @xmath35 and evolves as @xmath36 until @xmath37 for the salpeter - a imf @xcite . adopting a mass range of @xmath28@xmath29 for stars producing sne yields a sfr to sn rate conversion of @xmath38 and hence a @xmath34 sn rate density of @xmath39 .",
    "we use a set of the most recent 13 sn rate measurements @xcite , and apply additional redshift - evolving dust correction as suggested in @xcite , except to @xcite and @xcite that already implement such corrections . adding statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature , and fitting a function @xmath40 to the data , we obtain @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the missing sn fraction and its uncertainty , both derived from data , are shown by the vertical band . a critical compactness of @xmath43 therefore nominally solves the sn rate problem .",
    "although the uncertainties are large , this is in the same range inferred to solve the rsg problem .",
    "we use numerical simulations of sne to provide interpretations of the critical compactness identified in the previous section .",
    "our two - dimensional models @xcite are computed on a spherical polar grid of 384 radial zones from the center up to 5000 km and 128 angular zones covering @xmath44 , using the high - density eos of @xcite with a nuclear incompressibility of @xmath45 mev .",
    "we employ the isotropic diffusion source approximation @xcite and ray - by - ray approach to solve spectral transport of electron- and anti - electron neutrinos .",
    "heavy - lepton neutrinos are treated by a leakage scheme to include cooling .",
    "we take into account explosive nucleosynthesis and its energy feedback into the hydrodynamics by solving a 13 @xmath46-nuclei network @xcite .",
    "our three - dimensional models use a grid of 64 angular zones and 128 azimuthal zones ( takiwaki et al . ,  in preparation ) .",
    "the two - dimensional simulations are performed on the full set of solar- ( s ) , @xmath47 solar ( u ) , and zero - metallicity ( z ) progenitors of whw02 , a total of @xmath48 progenitor initial conditions .",
    "this allows systematic trends to be explored .",
    "fig [ fig : correlation ] shows one such trend , showing the remnant mass , defined as the mass within a density coordinate of @xmath49 , as a function of the progenitor @xmath4 , for all the s- , u- and z- models .",
    "simulations that fail to reach a successful explosion , as defined by the shock radius not reaching a radius of 400 km within the first @xmath50 s of simulation time ( equivalent to @xmath51 s in time since bounce ) , are marked by crosses .",
    "these failed explosions clearly populate the highest @xmath4 and confirm the predictive power of using @xmath4 to distinguish the outcome of core collapse .",
    "in fact , the compactness is a continuous measure of explosibility : the small panels of fig [ fig : correlation ] show how the explosion becomes increasingly smaller with higher @xmath4 .",
    "fig [ fig : correlation ] implies that the division between successful ( filled points ) and failed ( crosses ) explosions is @xmath52 , i.e. , a critical compactness that is significantly larger than the observationally inferred critical value of @xmath53@xmath54 .",
    "however , there are issues that complicate such a conclusion . first",
    ", many of the successful explosions with large compactness will likely not explode as canonical sne . for our eos",
    ", the maximum ns mass is @xmath55 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the remnants of progenitors with @xmath56 would collapse to bhs .",
    "thus , these sne will be dimmer due to mass fall back .",
    "second , additional physics are considered to be important in accurately predicting the outcome of core collapse , including general relativity and weak interaction physics ( see recent reviews , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , studies suggest that stars explode more easily in two dimensions than in three ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all of these can shift the location of the critical compactness for a successful explosion .     at @xmath57",
    "ms post bounce in 2d ( left ) and 3d ( right ) , illustrating the smaller nature of 3d explosions .",
    "each cube is 1000 km on each side , and the colour covers @xmath58@xmath59 ( black  yellow ) . _",
    "bottom _ : average shock radius @xmath60 ( solid line , left axis ) for 2d ( thin line ) and 3d ( thick line ) simulations , and the mass accretion rate @xmath61 ( dotted line , right axis ) , all for two progenitors : s11.2 ( blue ) and s27.0 ( red )",
    ". 2d simulations experience earlier shock revival , and higher @xmath4 corresponds to later shock revival.,width=302 ]    in order to provide a more realistic interpretation , we run select progenitors in both 2d and 3d . the lower panel of fig [ fig : threed ] shows the average shock radius ( left y - axis ) for 2d ( solid ) and 3d ( thick solid ) , and the mass accretion rate ( dashed , right y - axis ) , for the s@xmath62 and s@xmath63 progenitor models of whw02 .",
    "the importance of @xmath4 is once again observable : while s@xmath62 ( @xmath64 ) comfortably explodes , s@xmath63 ( @xmath65 ) does not @xcite .",
    "a more subtle but important point is that sn shock revival is slower in 3d than in 2d .",
    "this is clearly the case for s@xmath62 , where the 3d shock radius grows slower than the 2d shock radius . for s@xmath63",
    ", the 3d shock radius shows no signs of revival , while the 2d shock does .",
    "these results are consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "the upper panels of fig [ fig : threed ] show the entropy distribution for the s@xmath62 progenitor in 2d ( left ) and 3d ( right ) , both at @xmath57 ms post - bounce , illustrating how explosions are larger in 2d compared to the more round and compact 3d case .    .",
    "shown are the results from 377 2d simulations ( in solid ) and results from two 3d simulations ( square symbols ) .",
    "the dashed curve connects the 3d results whilst keeping the same shape as the 2d results .",
    ", width=302 ]    fig [ fig : compare ] illustrates the impact of dimensionality on the critical compactness .",
    "the solid curve shows the fraction of progenitors that successfully explode in our 2d simulations binned in @xmath4 .",
    "the plateau and sharp decline in the explosion fraction illustrates the power of using @xmath4 as an indicator of the core collapse outcome .",
    "the square symbols show the results of 3d simulations .",
    "each square corresponds to an individual progenitor as labeled .",
    "interestingly , they support a quantitatively different picture , with the critical compactness being @xmath2 or less .",
    "only a limit can be stated due to the small number of progenitors simulated in 3d .",
    "nevertheless , 3d simulations at present indicate it is possible for the critical compactness to be close to that required from observations .",
    "we have argued that current stellar and core - collapse simulations are consistent with the rsg and sn rate problems if all stars with compactness above a critical value of @xmath27 collapse to form bhs and do not successfully produce canonically luminous sne , i.e. , failed sne .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate how the compactness of the progenitor strongly impacts the outcomes of core collapse ( fig [ fig : correlation ] ) , and that the required critical compactness ( fig [ fig : compactness ] ) is compatible with state - of - the - art simulations ( fig [ fig : compare ] ) .",
    "there are several observational consequences of this scenario .",
    "in fact , similar values of @xmath66 have been previously inferred by consideration of remnant mass functions .",
    "@xcite show how the failed sn scenario reproduces the observed ns and bh mass functions without fine - tuning stellar evolution or core - collapse physics .",
    "secondly , the implied failed sn fraction is @xmath6740% , including stars in the @xmath25@xmath1 range and additional contribution from stars around @xmath68 .",
    "the value of @xmath69 is presently only weakly constrained by data , but this is poised to improve . the diffuse sn neutrino background currently limits @xmath70% @xcite , but will improve with more data taking @xcite .",
    "campaigns searching for disappearance of massive stars will obtain @xmath71% bounds down to @xmath7230% in 10 years observing @xcite .",
    "galactic data also provide some probe @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the scenario has implications for sn types and their progenitors .",
    "consider a simple model where ( i ) @xmath28@xmath73 stars produce iip sne , unless modified by binary interactions in which case they produce ibc or iib sne , ( ii ) @xmath25@xmath1 stars produce failed sne , and ( iii ) @xmath74@xmath75 stars produce ibc or iib sne .",
    "we ignore the other type ii ( iin , iil , etc ) sne here as they are a minority @xcite and we assume them to be distributed across the full range of stellar masses @xcite .",
    "the iip/(ibc+iib ) ratio is then @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the binary fraction .",
    "the observed iip/(ibc+iib ) ratio @xmath78 @xcite is then reproduced for a binary fraction @xmath79 , which is within current estimates based on o star statistics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario predicts that @xmath80 of ibc sne arise from binary stripped stars of initial mass @xmath81 .",
    "the main limitation of our study is the inherent uncertainties in the progenitor models that we have explored .",
    "the 1d progenitor models of whw02 have the advantage of being the largest set of models currently available , but there are important uncertainties that must be highlighted .",
    "the treatment of turbulent transport and mixing inside the star is a source of significant uncertainty , and studies have begun to reveal just how important realistic treatments beyond the mixing - length style treatments are ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "notably , the 1d progenitor models of @xcite do not show a peak in @xmath4 around @xmath15 seen in whw02 , although the number of progenitors is limited . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite observe the peaks with the mesa code .",
    "further works are therefore required to reveal whether the peak is a robust feature of stellar evolution or not .",
    "more data and studies will also help reveal the severity of the rsg and sn rate problems and hence importance of our scenario .",
    "for example , dynamical modelling of sne can help increase the number of sne with progenitor mass estimates . at present , however , such mass estimates vary widely for any given sne , highlighting the large systematic uncertainties involved . the significance of the sn rate problem will also be tested by future sfr data , and also as the systematics of sfr dust correction are studied further .    in summary ,",
    "modern studies of sn progenitors collectively point to a non - negligible fraction of massive stars potentially failing to produce successful sne .",
    "we have explored a connection of such observational features to the physics of core - collapse , namely , the compactness of the progenitors .",
    "we demonstrate how modern simulations support a trend of failed explosions at precisely where observations indicate potential failed explosions .",
    "an intriguing implication , then , is that the failures of many supernova simulations in producing robust explosions may actually be closer to reality than previously thought .",
