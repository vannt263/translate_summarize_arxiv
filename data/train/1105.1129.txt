    "<S> we study the electronic structure of graphene with a single substitutional vacancy using a combination of the density - functional , tight - binding , and impurity green s function approaches . </S>",
    "<S> density functional studies are performed with the all - electron spin - polarized linear augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method . </S>",
    "<S> the three @xmath0 dangling bonds adjacent to the vacancy introduce localized states ( v@xmath1 ) in the mid - gap region , which split due to the crystal field and a jahn - teller distortion , while the @xmath2 states introduce a sharp resonance state ( v@xmath3 ) in the band structure . for a planar structure , </S>",
    "<S> symmetry strictly forbids hybridization between the @xmath1 and the @xmath3 states , so that these bands are clearly identifiable in the calculated band structure . as for the magnetic moment of the vacancy , </S>",
    "<S> the hunds - rule coupling aligns the spins of the four localized v@xmath4 , v@xmath5 , and the v@xmath6 electrons resulting in a @xmath7 state , with a magnetic moment of @xmath8 , which is reduced by about @xmath9 due to the anti - ferromagnetic spin - polarization of the @xmath3 band itinerant states in the vicinity of the vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the net magnetic moment of @xmath10 . using the lippmann - schwinger equation , </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce the well - known @xmath11 decay of the localized v@xmath3 wave function with distance and in addition find an interference term coming from the two dirac points , previously unnoticed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the long - range nature of the v@xmath3 wave function is a unique feature of the graphene vacancy and we suggest that this may be one of the reasons for the widely varying relaxed structures and magnetic moments reported from the supercell band calculations in the literature . </S>"
