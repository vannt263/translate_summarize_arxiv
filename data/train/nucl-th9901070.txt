    "the transition of a nucleus from the superfluid to the normal state at high angular momentum is an interesting problem that is studied by means of modern @xmath2-detector arrays .",
    "contrary to the analogous transition in solids , in the finite nuclear system there is no sharp phase change but an extended transition region with in which pairing effects disappear .",
    "the most rapid attenuation of pair correlations is caused by quasiparticle excitations i.e. breaking of pairs .",
    "this case is realized in deformed nuclei when a large fraction of the angular momentum is generated along the symmetry axis of the nucleus .",
    "these states may appear as high-@xmath0 isomers near the yrast line .",
    "hence , the experimental data on high-@xmath0 isomers and the rotational structures built on those states contain valuable information about the pair correlations and how they are influenced by the rotation .    the theoretical analysis of high-@xmath0 band structures presented in this paper is based on the tilted axis cranking  @xcite ( tac ) model , which is a mean field approach for describing both the rotation and pair correlations in the framework of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory .",
    "in fact , the tac model has already been applied to the high-@xmath0 multi - quasiparticle bands in @xmath3  @xcite . there , only the effects of _ static _ pair field have been considered .",
    "the central aim of our present investigation is studying the role of _ dynamical _ pair correlations . for this purpose",
    "we apply the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to the pairing interaction , which includes the fluctuations of the pair field .",
    "the fluctuations are particularly important when the static pair field has collapsed .",
    "their relevance is suggested by the results of @xcite for @xmath3 as well as in the earlier investigations of the pair correlations of other high-@xmath0 band heads states  @xcite .",
    "the combination of the hfb theory with rpa does not provide an reliable description in the region where the pairing gap disappears  @xcite .",
    "there the particle number projection method ( pnp ) works better  @xcite .",
    "therefore , both methods , rpa and pnp , are considered and compared with each other .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we develop tac versions which include pairing - rpa or pnp .",
    "details of the calculations are given in section  [ parameters ] .",
    "the results of the calculations of high-@xmath0 bands in @xmath1 are presented in section  [ calc ] and compared with the experiment  @xcite .",
    "our investigations are based on the single particle routhian  @xcite of the tac model complemented by a monopole pair interaction term , @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the monopole pair field operator  @xcite and @xmath6 is the particle number operator . for simplicity",
    "the terms are written only for one kind of particles .    replacing in @xmath7 the pairing two - body term by the pair potential one obtains the quasiparticle routhian @xmath8 the diagonalization of @xmath9 ( for details cf.@xcite ) provides the quasiparticle energies @xmath10 as well as the hfb amplitudes ( @xmath11 ) , required later on for the rpa and pnp calculations . in order to define a quasiparticle state @xmath12 for a specific configuration",
    "the occupation numbers need to be chosen .",
    "the self - consistent treatment of @xmath9 implies determining the pair gap @xmath13 from the hfb gap equation @xmath14 and fixing the chemical potential @xmath15 by the particle number condition @xmath16 these conditions remain valid for the rpa but they will be modified for the pnp approach ( cf .",
    "section [ pnpmodel ] ) .",
    "the hfb part of the total routhian becomes @xmath17 in order to determine the deformation parameters @xmath18 we have constructed the total routhian surface ( trs ) using the standard strutinsky renormalization procedure as described e.g. in @xcite . as shown in  @xcite the essential shell - correction part @xmath19 of the trs can be calculated for a non - rotating and unpaired ground state .",
    "the contribution containing the dependence on rotation and pair field enters via the quasiparticle routhian , eq .",
    "( [ scrtac ] ) .",
    "hence , the total routhian can be written as @xmath20      so far only the mean field part of the pairing energy has been taken into account .",
    "now we include the pair correlation energy , which comes from quantum vibrations around the mean field minimum .",
    "the rpa treatment of the pair interaction gives the following expression for the correlation energy  @xcite @xmath21 + e_{ex}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 are the rpa frequencies for the pair vibrations , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are the two - quasiparticle energies and @xmath25 is the so - called boson exchange term .",
    "the total routhian is the obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ totalr],[eq : rpa - corr ] ) as @xmath26 due to the large number of rpa roots in deformed nuclei , it is practically impossible to evaluate the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpa - corr ] ) directly @xcite .",
    "however , it can be calculated by means of the integration method developed recently  @xcite , which is especially simple for pairing interaction .",
    "it uses the rpa response function @xmath27 ( cf.@xcite ) , which reads explicitly for our case : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath11 are the hfb amplitudes .",
    "the zeros of the function @xmath30 determine the the rpa frequencies , @xmath22 . continuing the variable @xmath31 into the complex plane @xmath32",
    ", one defines the spectral function @xmath33 .",
    "it has first order poles at @xmath22 and @xmath34 and it is analytical for all other complex values of @xmath32 . according to cauchy s theorem the following integral relation is obtained : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a arbitrary complex function which is analytical within the region enclosed by the integration path @xmath37 .",
    "the roots @xmath22 and the poles @xmath34 of @xmath38 lie in the same region . by choosing @xmath39 the rpa correlation energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpa - corr ] ) becomes @xmath40 where the integration path @xmath37 goes around the right half of the complex plane .",
    "the exchange term is given by @xmath41 as in  @xcite .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_int ] ) is independent of the path @xmath37 as long as all poles in the positive plane are enclosed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : int - cont ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath37 can always be chosen in such a way that the spectral function becomes smooth and the integration numerically stable , such that a small number of grid points can be used in the integration .",
    "the rpa correction to the angular momentum operator  @xcite @xmath42 gives us the rpa contribution @xmath43 of the rpa solution @xmath22 , where @xmath44 are the single particle matrix elements of the angular momentum components @xmath45 and the term @xmath46 is the boson image of the two quasiparticle scattering contribution of the angular momentum operator . by choosing the weight function @xmath47 in the integral , ( [ eq : g_int ] ) the corresponding rpa contribution to @xmath48 can be calculated too .",
    "it should be pointed out that eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpa - corr ] ) takes into account also the contribution from possible spurious modes . in the paired case @xmath49 the function",
    "@xmath38 has a root at @xmath50 .",
    "this does not cause a problem for the integration since the factor @xmath32 in the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpa - int ] ) cancels this pole . after the transition to @xmath51",
    "the spurious mode disappears .",
    "the above described method can be straightforwardly applied to obtain the correlation energy of the @xmath52 ground state band .",
    "the rpa for the excited configurations of the high-@xmath0 bands needs special care concerning the selection of the `` physical '' phonon modes from the full rpa spectrum @xmath53 which implies positive and negative frequencies .",
    "the general criterion is to select from the pair of roots @xmath53 the one with the positive normalization .",
    "such an identification is trivial for the ground configuration because there all @xmath54 have positive normalization .",
    "however , for excited configurations the normalization check has to be done explicitly .",
    "since the excited configurations under study are still close to the ground configuration the search for the possible physical phonons with @xmath55 can be confined to a narrow energy region of a few mev above zero . for this region the sum ( [ eq : rpa - corr ] )",
    "is directly evaluated whereas for the higher lying part the loop integration is done .",
    "we mention that the correlation energy is also for excited configurations a negative ( gain ) term the value of which depends on the rotational frequency as well as on the configuration under study .    in calculating the rpa contribution to the angular momentum components by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jrpa ] ) , we observed that for some phonons , @xmath22 , the backward going amplitudes become so large that the underlying quasiboson approximation ( qba ) of the rpa is no longer valid .",
    "this happens in excited configurations near instabilities of the static pair field , which occur when two configurations with different @xmath13 cross each other .",
    "examples are the bands @xmath56 ( neutron pairing ) and @xmath57 ( proton pairing ) , which will be discussed in section [ 71522 ] . for the low lying rpa solutions we check explicitly whether the qba condition , @xmath58 , is satisfied or not .",
    "we exclude roots with @xmath59 from the sum ( [ eq : jrpa ] ) .",
    "this procedure may be justified as follows . in the extended boson approximation ( eba )",
    "@xcite the non zero term @xmath60 is approximatively taken into account by an iterative process .",
    "the relevant effect of the eba as compared to qba is a strong reduction of the backward going amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "a full eba treatment is too demanding for a realistic calculation like ours .",
    "instead we use the rough approximation that the backward going amplitudes are quenched in the cases when qba is not valid .",
    "i.e. if @xmath59 the roots are removed from the sum ( [ eq : jrpa ] ) of the rpa correction",
    ". these roots would give a very large ( several units of @xmath61 ) contribution to the angular momentum .",
    "if they are included , @xmath62 changes very rapidly near the crossings between configurations with different @xmath13 .",
    "it is known the cranking model is unreliable near such crossings , where it seems justified to resort to an only rough correction of the qba , which results in a smooth reasonable function @xmath63 .",
    "the above treatment of the dynamical pair correlations by combining the hfb and rpa methods does not work for @xmath64 .",
    "another approximate method to include the dynamical pair correlations is the particle number projection ( pnp )  @xcite . in the pnp approach a variational state @xmath65 with good particle number @xmath66",
    "is formed by applying the projection integral @xmath67 to a tac eigenstate @xmath12 of the quasiparticle routhian @xmath9 , eq .",
    "( [ qp - routhian ] ) .",
    "number projection accounts for gauge angle fluctuations of the pair field on a circle in the complex plane ( @xmath68 ) with the radius @xmath13 , but disregards radial fluctuations .",
    "the pnp energy function to be minimized is the expectation value @xmath69 calculated with the projected state @xmath65 , eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) . we do not perform a full variation of the hfb amplitudes of the reference state @xmath12 but minimize the energy ( [ prtac ] ) only with respect to the variable gap parameter @xmath13 . the minimization of eq .",
    "( [ prtac ] ) in pnp replaces the self - consistency condition ( [ scdelta ] ) for calculating @xmath13 in the hfb approach .",
    "compared to the self - consistent pair gap ( denoted by @xmath70 in the following ) of an unprojected quasiparticle state , the pair gap @xmath71 optimizing the projected routhian ( [ prtac ] ) is generally larger and stays non - zero through the phase transition region .    in the hfb variant of tac",
    ", the constraint @xmath72 adds an additional dimension to the system of nonlinear equations given by eq .",
    "( [ scdelta ] ) and the minimization with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath73 . performing the pnp",
    "the above condition is automatically satisfied .",
    "instead @xmath15 becomes another variable parameter of the ritz variational problem , which is to be determined by minimizing the routhian .",
    "however , the minimum practically coincides with the solution of eq .",
    "( [ scn ] ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ e - lambda ] .",
    "this has the advantage that in the vicinity of the minimum the energy does not change very much .",
    "thus the errors remain small if the minimum in @xmath15 is not exactly found ( or eq .",
    "( [ scn ] ) is not exactly solved ) . keeping @xmath15 fixed greatly simplifies the actual calculation .",
    "however , one has to be careful that fixing @xmath15 does not affect the general properties of the configuration too much . as will be discussed in appendix  [ pnp ] , neglecting the exchange term of the interaction may lead to problems in calculating the projected energy .",
    "unlike the unprojected hfb function @xmath12 , the projected wave function  ( [ projection ] ) is not be stationary .",

    "their energies in the laboratory frame for a given value of @xmath127 do not differ much as well .",
    "that is so , because the energy needed for generating angular momentum along the two principal axes 1 and 3 is nearly the same .",
    "this feature , which is reflected by many bands with different orientation being close to the yrast line , is characteristic for the ( @xmath66,@xmath128 ) region where @xmath1 is situated .    in the upper and middle part of the 5082 proton and 82124 neutron shells",
    "there are many orbitals with higher @xmath31 values that strongly couple to the prolate deformed potential whereas the low-@xmath31 orbitals are occupied .",
    "figure  [ fig : pn5 ] shows the @xmath129 orbitals as an example . for the high-@xmath31 orbitals the coriolis coupling between states with @xmath31 and @xmath130 , which generate a contribution to @xmath131 , is weak , because the energy distance is large and the coupling matrix - element ( @xmath132 ) is small .",
    "this is very different from the nuclei situated at the bottom of the shell . for the low-@xmath31",

    "hence it is easy to generate a contribution to @xmath131 .",

    ", it is energetically favorable to generate a contribution to @xmath133 , because there are many orbitals with a large @xmath134 near the fermi surface and it does not cost much energy to generate a particle - hole excitation with a large @xmath135 . at the bottom of the shell these excitations cost much more energy , because the orbitals with large @xmath136 are far away .",
    "the net result is that at the beginning of the rare earth region the moment of inertia is larger than the rigid body value and generating angular momenta along the 3 axis is unfavorable . in the _ upper part _ of the region ,",
    "the moment of inertia is smaller than the rigid body value and generating angular momenta along the 1 and 3 axis is equally favorable ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) . the inclusion of pairing does not change this conclusion .",
    "figure  [ tk ] shows the @xmath131 and @xmath133 components for different @xmath0-bands calculated with hfb at a typical frequency @xmath125 . within @xmath137 ,",
    "the component @xmath133 is equal to @xmath0 which means that all bands are not far from the strong coupling regime .",
    "the largest deviation is found in the @xmath138 band where @xmath139 at @xmath125 .",
    "this is an effect of the configuration mixing in the neutron system , which is induced by quasi crossings in a region of high quasiparticle level density .",
    "the total spin @xmath127 is almost independent of @xmath0 , in accordance with the discussion above . generating the components @xmath131 and @xmath133 of angular momentum costs a comparable amount of energy .",
    "the slightly different behavior of the @xmath140 band is due to extra rotational alignment from the aligning @xmath98 proton orbital , see discussion in  @xcite .    summarizing our calculations concerning an improved treatment of pairing we find that i ) the conclusions of earlier work  @xcite can be confirmed and ii ) the angular momentum @xmath141 is insensitive to the pair correlations in the frequency region after the first band crossing .",
    "this is at variance with the results of @xcite for low - k bands , where a reduction of several units of angular momentum by the dynamical pair correlations was found .",
    "the reason is that the single particle orbits near the fermi surface , which contribute most to the collective angular momentum , are blocked for the pair correlation by generating the high k. the ratio @xmath142 is also reasonably well reproduced which support the calculated tilted geometry of our solutions .",
    "we included dynamical pair correlations into the tilted axis cranking approach in two different ways : the pairing - rpa method , which allows for harmonic vibrations on top of the hfb mean field , and the particle number projection which describes the dynamical correlations by an increased static pair gap in conjunction with projection onto good particle number .",
    "we studied the high @xmath0-bands in @xmath1 by means of both methods .",
    "as known from investigation of the band head energies  @xcite , the hfb approach tends to underestimate the energetic separation between the bands .",
    "inclusion of the dynamic correlations improves the energy of bands with zero static pair correlations relative to each other and to the bands with pronounced static pair correlations .",
    "when the static pair field is substantial we could not find a systematic improvement of the relative energy due to the dynamical pair correlation .",
    "this seems to be in contrast to the result for @xmath52 bands in  @xcite .",
    "the pronounced reduction of the moment of inertia of high-@xmath0 bands relative to the rigid body value , seen in the experiment , is not due to the pair correlations .",
    "it is caused by orbitals close to the fermi surface which in the mid and upper part of its shell is disfavoring the generation of angular momenta perpendicular to the symmetry axis .",
    "it is typical for this region , that the generation of angular momentum along the symmetry axis by particle - hole excitation is equally favorable as compared to the rotational alignment i.e. collective rotation along the perpendicular axis ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "the inclusion pair correlations , both static and dynamic , does not significantly affect this feature of high-@xmath0 bands , which is in stark contrast to low-@xmath0 bands .    in bands",
    "where the static pair gap of the hfb treatment has collapsed to zero the rpa method is simpler to use than pnp because there is no need to minimize the routhian with respect to the @xmath13 and @xmath15 parameters .",
    "the pair gap introduced in these pnp calculations causes irregularities in the energy and angular momentum which are caused by quasiparticle band crossings .",
    "the rpa method , which does not have these crossings , describes the experimental results better .",
    "thus , we consider the irregularities appearing in pnp as an artifact of the approximation and rpa superior in this region . on the other hand , when the hfb mean field pair gap is reduced but not yet zero the rpa method has problems because of its deficiencies near the transition to zero pairing . in these cases",
    "it turns out to be important to check the quality of the quasiboson approximation when calculating the rpa contribution to the angular momentum .",
    "the pnp method is more stable in these cases .",

    "the hfb pairing energy is usually calculated in hartree approximation , i.e. neglecting the exchange term by factorizing the pairing matrix element @xmath143 .",
    "this approximation is justified for the calculation of the pairing energy contribution without pnp .",
    "however , it was recently suggested  @xcite that the neglect of exchange terms in performing pnp can lead to dangerous poles in the resulting total routhian surface ( trs ) such an unphysical behavior of the pes was indeed found in our calculations and it was traced back to the above mentioned factorization . for the sake of completeness we sketch the argumentation presented in more detail in  @xcite .    using in the construction of the pnp state @xmath65 eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) and the canonical ( bcs - like ) form  @xcite of the hfb state @xmath12 , the number projected pairing energy @xmath144 can be written as the sum @xmath145 where the direct term @xmath146 ^ 2 < \\varphi=0|\\varphi>.      \\label{direct}\\ ] ] and the usually neglected exchange term @xmath147 these expressions contain the canonical bcs - amplitudes @xmath148 of the quasiparticle state and the matrix elements @xmath149 of the pair operator in the canonical basis .",
    "the bracket @xmath150 is the overlap function between gauge rotated quasiparticle states .",
    "one may encounter a zero denominator @xmath151 in both energy terms ( [ direct],[exchange ] ) e.g. for @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "this is because the double zero in the denominator can not be canceled by the corresponding single zero in the overlap @xmath154 , eq .",
    "( [ overlap ] ) .",
    "however , when summing up the two contributions  ( [ direct],[exchange ] ) to the full pairing energy @xmath155 such unphysical poles do exactly cancel .",
    "our calculations confirm the conclusion that a reliable calculation of the trs with pnp has to be done with the full expression . in fig .",
    "[ eproj ] the full neutron energy is shown as a function of the neutron gap ( @xmath13 ) and it is compared to the one where only the direct pairing energy term  ( [ direct ] ) is taken into account . the full energy has the expected parabolic shape with the minimum whereas the curve of the direct term alone displays an unphysical pole around @xmath156 mev .",
    "such a strange behavior does not happen often and usually there is only a minor difference between the extracted @xmath13-value at the minimum for the full and direct energy ( cf .",
    "[ delta - pnp ] ) .",
    "observables like the energy are not strongly affected by the exchange term except close to poles ( cf .",

    "we obtain a minimum for a slightly different @xmath13 and , therefore , a different @xmath101 is needed to match the experimental @xmath13-values .",
    "we found that a @xmath157 of @xmath158 mev instead of @xmath159 mev should be used for the protons while the @xmath160 did not change when using the full expression for the pairing energy .",

    "[ eproj ] ) of a pole can also affect the results and this is , of course , much harder to detect .",
    "the energy surface calculated with only the direct term jumps when passing through the pole .",
