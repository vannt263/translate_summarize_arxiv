    "the solar chromosphere is filled with fibrils in plages and mottles in network seen on the disk and with spicules seen at the limb .",
    "although the mutual correspondence of fibrils , mottles , and spicules has not yet been established directly , we believe that they represent the same feature seen under different circumstances ( cf.@xcite ) . their ubiquity is especially evident in images taken at the center of strong spectral lines .",
    "so far most effort has been directed towards understanding their nature , internal structure @xcite , and drivers @xcite .",
    "less attention has been paid to their less obvious tangential motions ( i.e. , perpendicular to the axis ) which may betray braiding of chromospheric magnetic fields due to vortex granular flows underneath @xcite .",
    "the first spectroscopic observation of spicule motions parallel to the limb was made by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported on the quasi - periodic motion of spicules along the limb with tangential velocities of 1015kms@xmath1 and amplitudes about 1arcsec .",
    "@xcite pointed out the similarity between radial ( i.e. , along the line - of - sight ) and tangential velocities of spicules along the limb and speculated on the motion of spicules as a whole .    in this paper , we study tangential motions of fibrils in a small isolated plage and nearby network using a 10-min time sequence of h@xmath0 filtergrams obtained with the dutch open telescope ( dot ) .",
    "we concentrate on relatively short - lived straight dynamic fibrils ( henceforth dfs , @xcite ) exhibiting conspicuous elongation and/or retraction within a few minutes .",
    "longer , more static or more curved fibrils are not considered here .",

    "a tomographic multiwavelength image sequence was recorded during excellent seeing from 10:53:05  ut until 11:02:54  ut . the seeing quality measured at the g band by the average , maximum , and minimum fried parameter @xmath5 was 13.0 , 16.2 , 8.6 , respectively .",
    "the processed data and movies are available at http://dotdb.phys.uu.nl / dot/. the burst cadence was 12s .",
    "the resulting time sequence was reconstructed by speckle masking and other steps as summarized in @xcite . in this study , we analyse the 10-min sequence of h@xmath0 filtergrams taken by the dot lyot filter @xcite with a fwhm passband of 0.025 nm at @xmath6 nm from line center .    inspecting the h@xmath0 movie frame - by - frame we focused on relatively short - lived ( @xmath75min ) , straight dfs exhibiting apparent elongation or / and retraction .",
    "we identified fourteen such dfs and measured the image coordinates of the apparent feet and tops per individual frame . because the feet locations also vary with time we used the time - averaged feet positions as references .",
    "we measured the df orientations with respect to the @xmath3-axis ( terrestrial north ) and the df lengths along lines connecting their tops and reference foot locations .",

    "figure  [ koza - fig : dphi - omegal ] shows the measured variations in orientation for the fourteen selected dfs and the rate of change in orientation inferred from linear fits to the curves at left plotted against average df length . although the measurements suffer from uncertainty and subjectivity , systematic trends appear .",
    "the orientation variations of some short - lived dfs can be characterised as a progression between sign changes , i.e. , orientation change from one limit position to another .",
    "in contrast , the dfs present during the whole time sequence show stable orientation with only episodic deviations from the average value .",
    "figure  [ koza - fig : dphi - omegal ] suggests that the angular turning speed may be related to df length , and that shorter dfs turn faster than longer ones .",
    "the average fibril lengths and angular velocities yield an estimate of centrifugal acceleration of 1ms@xmath9 .",
    "because of projection and the magnetic nature of dfs @xcite , we interpret the temporal variation of the measured fibril orientation as a sum of variations in azimuth and inclination of magnetic flux tubes with respect to the local vertical . in the context of force - free fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the phenomenon may indicate field twisting and braiding by vortex granular flows beneath @xcite , injection of twist into the corona , and twisted coronal fans seen in trace euv movies . on the basis of the indicated relation between angular velocity and length ( fig.[koza - fig : dphi - omegal ] ) we suggest that granulation with larger vortical flows produce more upright flux tubes , i.e. , faster turning and shorter in projection on the disk , but better seen as long spicules at the limb with conspicuous tangential motions as reported in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in contrast , granulation with smaller or no vortical flows permits more slanted flux tubes with smaller angular velocities , longer in on - disk projection but hardly observable on the limb because of crowding .",
    "measurements of the horizontal flow fields in the photosphere and elimination of the projection effects are needed to test this scenario .",
    "the observed angular velocity of @xmath10degmin@xmath1 implies more intensive twisting of the field lines than in sunspots which have typical rotation velocities of about 1degh@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "using a time sequence of high - resolution h@xmath0 filtergrams obtained by the dot we have searched for temporal variation in the azimuthal orientation of fourteen dynamic fibrils .",
    "they show significant variation , for shorter - lived fibrils indicating turning motions at about 1degmin@xmath1 .",
    "shorter dfs turn faster than longer ones , which may indicate difference in granulation vorticity .",
    "this conjecture suggests measurements of horizontal flow fields in the photosphere together with elimination of the projection effects in fibril imaging .",
