    "the corresponding cosmological model is the well known kantowski - sachs model @xcite . @xmath7",
    "the singularity at @xmath8 is the curvature singularity of schwarzschild @xmath9 , where the curvature is infinite , but the singularity at @xmath10 is just a lightlike surface where the curvature is regular and we pass from the kantowski - sachs region to the schwarzschild region .",
    "we need two copies of each of these regions to describe the complete casual structure of this spacetime .    in string",
    "theory one of the important open problems is the correct treatment of time - dependent backgrounds . in @xcite @xmath3-branes were first introduced .",
    "they are objects arising when dirichlet boundary conditions on open strings are imposed on the time direction .",
    "an @xmath3-brane is a topological defect @xcite , all of whose longitudinal dimensions are spacelike , and consequently they exist only for a moment of time .",
    "@xmath3-branes have been found as explicit time - dependent solutions of einstein s equations ( dilaton antisymmetric tensor fields are also included in some models ) @xcite in the same way as black - hole - like solutions correspond to @xmath11-brane solutions .",
    "some of these solutions are actually best thought of as an analytical continuation of ordinary d - branes , or @xmath4 d - branes , for short @xcite .",
    "a simple model has been considered in @xcite , using only the 4d einstein equations in vacuum .",
    "the schwarzschild - kantowski - sachs model has been utilized to nicely define a simple @xmath12 model for an @xmath3-brane . by analytic continuation the spherical space @xmath13 is transformed into a hyperbolic space @xmath14 to obtain the hyperbolic symmetry @xmath15 , as suggested by the fact that s - branes are kinks in time . beginning with the schwarzschild solution",
    ", these authors performed the transformation @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . by these means",
    "they were able to obtain a rotated penrose diagram for the @xmath21 s - brane solution with well - defined time - dependent regions .",
    "as mentioned above , what in ref .",
    "@xcite was called  horizon methods \" of generating cosmological solutions has a long history , though it never seems thought of as a  method \" .",
    "the idea of this method is to reinterpret a part of a known manifold as a cosmological solution of einstein s equations . for static and stationary axisymmetric solutions which have horizons ,",
    "as one crosses the horizon what was the  radial \" direction becomes timelike , and the timelike direction becomes spacelike , and the model becomes a time ( and `` angular '' ) dependent cosmological model .    in the kantowski - sachs model",
    "we see for the first time a problem of global topology .",
    "if we insist that our model have a closed topology , we can achieve this by compactifying in the @xmath22-direction , but if one crosses the horizon once more , the  schwarzschild \" portion is closed in the time direction , which would allow closed timelike lines .",
    "this problem has been noted in several  black - hole \" -cosmology pairs , the most notable example being the taub - nut manifold @xcite .",
    "various metrics , including that mentioned above , as well as topological problems are discussed in more detail in ref",
    ". @xcite .",
    "there has been an enormous amount of work on exact solutions of  black - hole \" type axisymmetric metrics , and a large number of axisymmetric solutions with horizons have been found . it is natural to ask what kind of time and  angular \" dependent backgrounds are generated as the portion of these manifolds inside their horizons . since axisymmetric metrics are characterized by two commuting killing vector , one timelike and the other , associated with a symmetry about an axis , spacelike , it is not surprising that the corresponding models are the two - killing - vector models studied exhaustively by gowdy @xcite .",
    "since these  black - hole \" models are usually assumed to have compact surfaces that have an @xmath23 topology , and one compactifies the new @xmath24 constant surfaces by identification , they will be gowdy models with an @xmath0 topology .",
    "the paradigm for such models is the kerr metric , whose associated cosmological model was presented in ref .",
    "there are several features of this model that are common to many of the axisymmetric solutions .",
    "one is that there are two horizons , an outer horizon and an inner one . the time and  angular \" dependent gowdy model",
    "is represented by the region between these two horizons . inside the inner horizon",
    "the light cones have changed in such a way that we have a  black - hole \" type of solution .",
    "a second feature is that there are no curvature singularities in the region between these two horizons , which would have been an interesting example of an inhomogeneous singularity .",
    "a third feature is that the apparent singularities of the gowdy model are only horizons .",
    "this feature is not general , as we will see below .",
    "the no - hair theorems show that only the kerr family of metrics can represent true black holes . the other members of the enormous zoo of black - hole - like solutions are untenable as black hole models because they contain curvature singularities on or outside of the outer horizon",
    ". this fact does not affect the gowdy interiors , but instead makes them more interesting models .",
    "another point about the  black hole \" solutions is that many of them have been found as solutions of the ernst equation .",
    "the simple fact that we have passed inside the horizon does not make the ernst equation invalid , and one might expect that cosmological models with two commuting killing vectors could be generated using the same techniques that were useful in the stationary axisymmetric case . this possibility will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper by the same authors .",
    "recently , it was shown that particular gowdy models can be generated from the data given on a specific hypersurface by applying solution generating techniques @xcite . in the present article",
    "we will only make mention of some points related to this concept .",
    "as we mentioned above , the entire zoo of axisymmetric solutions with horizons could be laboriously converted to gowdy models and their features studied . in this paper",
    "we only plan to give a few of the more interesting solutions .",
    "these solutions can be broken down into three categories , each one with a representative metric or class of metrics .",
    "these three are :    \\1 ) simple solutions  the zipoy - voorhees metric , + 2 ) more complicated kerr - like solutions  tomimatsu - sato metrics , + 3 ) complicated curvature - singularity - horizon behavior on the  horizons \" +  the erez - rosen metric .",
    "+    the models we will present correspond to each of these three cases .",
    "they are time and  angular \" dependent backgrounds , gowdy models , which we will describe in this article .",
    "it is not the purpose of this work to analyze the possibility of defining the corresponding models as @xmath4-models as has been done with @xmath2-branes in @xcite and for a simple @xmath12 model in @xcite , and recently for the kerr metric in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an analysis of generalized s - brane solutions corresponding to the three categories of metrics considered here is in progress and will be reported on elsewhere . in general",
    "we expect these @xmath3-brane backgrounds to be gravitational fields rather than simple counterparts of homogeneous cosmologies .",
    "gowdy models are the simplest example of a true field theory .",
    "this has always been one of the major uses of gowdy models , that is , as a gravitational field theory that ( in the polarized case ) has simple exact solutions .    in section",
    "ii we present some general considerations for the transition from axisymmetric static , stationary solutions to @xmath25 time and  angular \" dependent gowdy models in the context of the horizon method . in sections",
    "iii , iv and v we will present the models corresponding to each of these metrics mentioned above , and will analyze the behavior of the relevant metric functions , especially near the singularities and horizons .",
    "section vi is devoted to conclusions and suggestions for further research .",
    "axisymmetric solutions are often given in lewis - papapetrou form . here",
    "we will use prolate spheroidal coordinates where the metric takes the form ds^2 = & - & f ( dt- d)^2 + f^-1 ( x^2 -1 ) ( 1-y^2 ) d^2 + & & + f^-1 e^2 ( x^2-y^2 ) , [ met1 ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are functions of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "the quantity @xmath29 is the  angular \" variable , and it is usual to make the transformation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the ordinary polar angle . the cosmological sector of these metrics is the region where @xmath37 . in order to make contact with previous gowdy formulations , we will define @xmath38 in the cosmological region . in this region the term @xmath39 changes sign , which allows us to interpret @xmath40 as a time coordinate . with these changes ,",
    "the metric ( [ met1 ] ) between its horizons takes the form for unpolarized @xmath41 gowdy models that has been used by several authors @xcite , ds^2 & = & e^-/2 e^/2 ( -e^-2 d^2 + d^2 ) + & & + ( e^- ) [ e^p d^2 + 2e^p q dd+(e^p q^2 + e^-p ^2 ) d^2 ] , [ sls2 ] where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 of ( [ met1 ] ) and @xmath44 is now supposed to be a spacelike direction , and we have compactified in the @xmath42 direction by supposing that @xmath45 , with zero and @xmath46 identified . the functions in this metric can be identified with @xmath47 and @xmath48 of ( [ met1 ] ) by e^-/2 e^/2 = ba e^2(^2 e^- - ^2 ) [ lambda ] e^p = - abe^-  , q = -  . [ pandq ] the form of the @xmath49 term is due to the fact that the two - metric in @xmath50 and @xmath51 must have determinant @xmath52 for the metric ( [ sls2 ] ) to be a solution of the einstein equations , a condition that ( [ sls2 ] ) obeys .",
    "there are a number of points that we will see in all of the three cases discussed below .",
    "the most important point is the sign of @xmath53 in ( [ sls2 ] ) . in order to have the correct signature in ( [ met1 ] )",
    ", it is assumed that for @xmath54 is positive , and for @xmath55 to be real in ( [ sls2 ] ) , either @xmath31 or @xmath32 must change sign at @xmath56 . while this is the case for some of the metrics we will study , it is not true for all of them .",

    "a second problem with the @xmath40 and @xmath36 coordinates is that there might be at least a coordinate singularity at @xmath71 .",
    "of course , this depends on the form of @xmath72 . in all of the cases we will consider",

    "the zipoy - voorhees @xcite metric in lewis - papapetrou form and prolate spheroidal coordinates has the form of ( [ met1 ] ) with = 0 , f=(x-1x+1)^  , e^2= ( x^2 - 1x^2-y^2)^^2  , where the constant parameter @xmath76 lies in the range @xmath77 with no other restrictions , which implies that we can take a = ( x^2 - 1)^  , b=(x+1)^2  . between the inner and outer horizons we take @xmath38 , and we have a = ( -1)^^2 ( e^- )  , b = ( 1 + e^- ) ^2  . since in this `` polarized '' case ( @xmath78 ) the equation for @xmath55 only depends on derivatives of @xmath55 , and we can add @xmath79 to @xmath55 and still have a solution , so we find that e^p = ^2 - 1 ( e^- ) ( 1+e^-)^2 [ zv ] for any @xmath76 is a gowdy solution , which can be seen by substituting this expression into ( [ sls2 ] ) with @xmath78 . in fact , ( [ zv ] ) is the general solution ( up to a trivial multiplicative constant ) of ( [ sls2 ] ) for @xmath55 independent of @xmath36 , as can be shown by quadratures .",
    "this solution can also be written as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a legendre function of the second kind , a form well known in the @xmath82 region .",

    "in which we recover the kantowski - sachs model , there exists only one singularity at @xmath87 .",
    "it is interesting to mention that for @xmath88 , the only singularity is situated at @xmath89 . whereas in the kantowski - sachs model the singularity at @xmath87 corresponds to a big bang at the origin from which the universe expands forever free of singularities , in the dual case ( @xmath90 ) the universe possesses a regular origin and evolves asymptotically @xmath91 into a big crunch curvature singularity .",

    "consequently , the metric functions for the corresponding gowdy model can be written as @xmath189 @xmath190    @xmath191    we now have a time and angular dependent background which evolves in time from @xmath192 to @xmath193 .    since @xmath78 this is a polarized gowdy model , so there is a separable general solution for @xmath55 as a sum over legendre polynomials , @xmath194 erez - rosen is a particular solution where the expression ( [ perro1 ] ) , using ( [ psir ] ) , reduces to @xmath195 where the @xmath196 are legendre functions of the second kind .",
    "this is a relatively simple function , and if we use @xmath197 to write @xmath198 @xmath199 is simply a time - dependent amplitude times @xmath200 , a very well known function . for completeness",
    ", however , we will graph @xmath201 versus @xmath36 in figure ( 4 ) and @xmath202 ( @xmath203 times the amplitude of @xmath199 at @xmath131 ) versus @xmath40 in figure ( 5 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath202 is just @xmath204 `` stretched '' by the exponential factor @xmath169 .",

    "however , the limiting values of this region show interesting behavior . to see this ,",
    "let us turn back to the erez - rosen metric since we know that these limiting values of the cosmological evolution correspond to the horizon of the exterior `` black hole '' solution .",
    "the horizon in the erez - rosen metric is determined by the zeros of the norm of the killing vector @xmath206 associated with the time coordinate @xmath43 : ^_= ( x+1)^1+qp_2(x ) p_2(y ) ( x-1)^1+qp_2(x ) p_2(y )  . here",
    "the horizon turns out to be at @xmath207 with the interesting feature that its existence depends on the values of the constant @xmath109 and the angular coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , the hypersurface @xmath207 is a horizon only if the condition @xmath208 is satisfied , i.e. for @xmath209 @xmath210    notice that when these conditions are not satisfied the norm of the killing vector diverges ( killing singularity ) .",
    "an analysis of these conditions leads to the following conclusions : for @xmath211 the horizon occupies the entire hypersurface @xmath212 , i.e. it does not depend on the angular coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "this , of course , includes the limiting case @xmath152 ( the schwarzschild limit ) in which no killing singularity exists at @xmath212 . if we represent the hypersurface @xmath212 by a circle , the horizon coincides with the entire circle . for @xmath213 ,",
    "the horizon is symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) , but it does not cover the entire hypersurface @xmath212 .",
    "indeed , around the symmetry axis @xmath216 a killing singularity appears that extends from @xmath131 to @xmath217 .",
    "the arc - length of the section occupied by the killing singularity reaches its maximum value when @xmath218 , i.e. , for @xmath219 . for positive values of @xmath109 and @xmath220 ,",
    "the horizon at @xmath212 is symmetric with respect to the symmetry axis ( @xmath221 and reaches its maximum arc - length with respect to the axis at @xmath222 for @xmath223 .",
    "the remaining section of the hypersurface @xmath212 is covered by the killing singularity .",
    "there is a particular angular direction _",
    "- = arccos  , q < -1  , [ angn ] or _ + = arccos  , q > 2  , [ angp ] which determines the boundary on @xmath212 that separates the horizon from the killing singularity .",
    "in fact , due to the axial symmetry this boundary corresponds to a sphere @xmath224 .",
    "so we see that in the case @xmath225 and @xmath226 , the hypersurface @xmath212 contains a horizon and a killing singularity as well .",
    "the corresponding gowdy cosmological model is defined `` inside '' this hypersurface .",
    "since the analytic expression for the kretschman scalar in this case is rather cumbersome , we only quote the results of our analysis .",
    "there exists a true curvature singularity at @xmath227 , independent of the values of @xmath109 and the angular variable @xmath29 .",
    "( this corresponds to the schwarzschild singularity at the origin of coordinates . )",
    "a second singularity is situated on the hypersurface @xmath212 for all values of @xmath109 and @xmath29 , except on the symmetry axis @xmath228 and for the special direction @xmath229 ( or @xmath230 , i.e. , on the boundary between the `` horizon '' and the killing singularity . in those particular directions",
    "the kretschman scalar remains constant .",
    "this means that the cosmological model inside the `` singular horizon '' evolves from a true big bang singularity at @xmath227 ( @xmath231 ) into a true big crunch singularity everywhere at @xmath212 ( @xmath232 ) , except in the special directions @xmath233 . from the point of view of the exterior ( @xmath179 )",
    "`` black hole '' spacetime , the interior @xmath234 cosmological model can be reached only through the `` angular windows '' located at @xmath233 .",
    "time - dependent backgrounds can be generated in a systematic way by means of what was called  horizon methods \" in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we applied this procedure to the kerr metric and were able to obtain a time and  angular \" dependent background , a gowdy @xmath0 model . in this work",
    "we have extended the previous analysis and have been able to exhibit backgrounds depending on time and an  angular \" variable , gowdy @xmath0 models that correspond to each of the three categories of axisymmetric solutions , the simple zipoy - voorhees metric , tomimatsu - sato metrics and the erez - rosen metric which has complicated curvature - singularity - horizon behavior .    in the case of the zipoy - voorhees metric we have shown that the outer and inner  horizons \" are actually surfaces of infinite curvature ( naked singularities ) and the models are then untenable as black hole models because they violate cosmic censorship . however , between the  horizons \" it represents a viable time and  angular \" dependent background .",
    "the gowdy models generated by the tomimatsu - sato metrics we studied ( including the kerr metric of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are unique among our three metrics in that they are unpolarized gowdy models ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this means that it is the only solution that can not be written as a linear sum over eigenfunctions ( legendre polynomials ) .",
    "another point is that the cosmological singularities are just horizons except for the extreme @xmath235 model with @xmath236 and @xmath237 , where there is a ring curvature singularity at @xmath215 on the horizons .    in the case of the erez - rosen metric",
    "we have seen that it can be interpreted as a polarized gowdy model inside the `` singular horizon '' .",
    "this horizon is special in the sense that for a large range of values of the `` quadrupole moment '' it allows the existence of a `` regular horizon '' ( with an @xmath224 topology ) through which the interior time and angular dependent sector can be reached .",
    "the tomimatsu - sato metrics and the erez - rosen metric represent long - wavelength unpolarized and polarized `` gravitational waves '' propagating around the universe ( the zipoy - voorhees metric is a degenerate example that does not depend on the `` angular '' variable ) .",
    "the field - theory @xmath3-brane solutions generated from these metrics may be of interest as simple field - theory brane models .",
    "s - brane solutions have been generated by means of the kerr metric .",
    "these solutions have been proposed and studied independently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have outlined the possibility of using the procedure presented here and in @xcite to generate models that would correspond to generalized @xmath3-brane solutions .",
    "the corresponding time dependent solutions to the three different categories of axisymmetric solutions presented here also depend on an  angular \" coordinate .",
    "an analysis of the models that one would obtain by introducing an @xmath4-factor in the coordinates is in progress and the s - brane solutions generated by this procedure will be discussed elsewhere .",

    "one could check that curvature invariants are nonsingular on that surface , but for our metrics it is simple enough to find a coordinate transformation that makes the metric nonsingular .    in the @xmath241 sector of the gowdy metric",
