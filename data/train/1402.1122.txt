    "an asymptotic evaluation of @xmath12 is possible by classical versions of the circle method , and there is an established theory that has been developed in parallel with the asymptotic formula in waring s problem ( see vaughan @xcite and wooley @xcite for an account ) , and to which we have nothing to add .",

    "it is the geometrically most natural and the analytically most challenging choice . indeed , if one considers as an affine equation and cuts out a portion of its integral solutions by a constraint like @xmath52 , then the underlying surface has hyperbolic spikes where standard counting routines tend to deny service .",

    "some mundane analytic number theory then yields a version of theorem [ thm01 ] for the equation , but with the euclidean norm used in the definition of height .",
    "this approach rests on the observation that the biprojective variety defined by carries a natural group structure .",
    "a similar line of thought is present in much work related to the manin - peyre conjecture , following the pivotal analysis of flag varieties by franke , manin and tschinkel @xcite . in the higher degree cases of theorem [ 01 ] , however , an analogous theory is not available , and we will have to turn to other methods .",

    "it seems natural to appoach the equation directly by the circle method .",
    "a first attempt was made by robbiani .",
    "he also studied the bilinear case @xmath53 , @xmath46 and used a version of the circle method that relies on an identity of duke , friedlander and iwaniec @xcite , and that heath - brown @xcite applied to the analytic theory of quadratic and cubic forms .",
    "robbiani s result only covers the cases @xmath61 , and does not easily generalise to higher degree .",
    "a more classical approach has been engineered by spencer @xcite .",
    "his method is in the spirit of vinogradov s description of the circle method .",
    "spencer concentrates on the equation where the height contraint @xmath62 @xmath63 prevents the generating function from immediate factorisation .",
    "this causes considerable complication in detail . as spencer shows",
    ", it is possible to disentangle the height condition with an appropriate fourier analysis .",
    "however , certain difficulties remain , and if @xmath64 denotes the function @xmath12 in the special case , then spencer only shows that @xmath65 , with some unspecified constant @xmath34 .    in this memoir we propose another approach to problems in this class that is based on a straightforward use of the circle method on the one hand , and on the other on a version of dirichlet s method of the hyperbola in weighted setting .",
    "once the machinery is set up , it delivers theorem [ 01 ] with great ease , and with a single treatment for all choices of the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath3 and @xmath17 .",
    "it transpires that the method should be widely applicable in related contexts . with a careful use of the ideas contained in this paper , the conclusions in theorem [ 01 ] for the equation",
    "can be refined to @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a suitable real number .",
    "we do not present the details here but refer to our forthcoming article @xcite .",
    "another class of varieties where our methods can be applied is related to vinogradov s mean value theorem .",
    "while the diagonal equation can be viewed as the `` germ '' that produces by inserting suitable products , we now consider a system a_l,0y_0^l + a_l,1y_1^l + ",
    "+ a_l , n y_n^l = 0 ( 1ld ) with integer coefficients @xmath69 as the germ .",
    "then , the equations _ j=0^n a_l , j ( x_1,jx_2,j x_k , j)^l = 0 ( 1ld ) are homogeneous in the variables @xmath4 , and therefore the system defines another variety in @xmath6 . as before ,",

    "the height of a rational point is now defined by @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath71 denote the number of rational points on the multiprojective variety defined by with height not exceeding @xmath16 and with @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "there is then a result for @xmath71 that is very similar to theorem [ thm01 ] .",
    "again , our method requires nearly optimal control on a certain moment of a suitable weyl sum .",

    "there is a widely held belief that @xmath80 should hold for all @xmath81 .",
    "this is trivial for @xmath53 and well - known for @xmath82 ( see , for example , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "very recently wooley @xcite proved @xmath83 . with the arrival of efficient congruencing in epoque - making work of wooley @xcite , early upper bounds on @xmath72 due to vinogradov and others",
    "remain of historical value .",
    "progress with the new methods is still ongoing , but we now know that @xcite @xmath84    our proof of theorem [ thm01 ] begins with counting primitive solutions to inside boxes @xmath85 @xmath86 . irrespective of the shape of the box , connaisseurs of the circle method will find the task of supplying an asymptotic formula for this count fairly routine . as a second step , one needs to express @xmath12 in terms of the count in boxes .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath87 , and let @xmath88 denote the number of primitive @xmath9 satisfying and @xmath89 , @xmath13 @xmath90 . then , according to the opening paragraph of this memoir , ( b ) = 2 ^ -k _ m_1m_2 ",
    "m_k b^1/(n+1-d ) ( ) , and one desires to deduce an asymptotic formula for this sum from related formulae for ( x_1,  ,x_k)= ( ) that are the relevant sums for the count in boxes .",
    "the transition from to can be performed subject to very mild and general conditions , the actual definition of @xmath91 being irrelevant for this part of the argument .",
    "hence , apart from the specific applications to problems such as those considered in theorems [ thm01 ] and [ thm02 ] , we provide a method to evaluate divisor sums with weights similar to the one in .",
    "this tool should be of some utility in the analytic theory of numbers , and certainly constitutes the most novel feature of our analysis .",
    "precise statements and a discussion of the underlying ideas of the transition process from to are deferred to next section that can be read independently of the rest of the paper . in section 3",
    "we study weyl sums over products in preparation for the circle method work in section 4 .",
    "each of these sections is equipped with a short introduction to the respective subject . in the short final section ,",
    "theorem [ thm01 ] is deduced from the main conclusions formulated in sections 2 and 4 .",
    "not only in structure but up to fine detail , the proof of theorem [ thm02 ] is very similar and therefore omitted .    _",
    "notation_. owing to the wide range of topics discussed in this paper , a completely consistent notation would be in conflict with the various traditions involved .",
    "however , most of the notation used is standard . small italics usually denote integers , letters from the middle of the alphabet like @xmath66 , @xmath17 or @xmath92 , but also @xmath3 are natural numbers , and @xmath93 is a non - negative integer .",
    "the letter @xmath38 is reserved for primes .",
    "capital italics @xmath94 and @xmath95 are used for the main parameters , and statements involving such a parameter are valid for its positive values exceeding @xmath7 .",
    "real variables are denoted by small greek letters , but also by @xmath96 .",
    "these conventions apply with or without subscript whenever the symbol does not obviously denote a function .",
    "the letter @xmath19 always denotes a positive real number , and whenever @xmath19 occurs in a statement it is asserted that the statement is valid for all positive numbers @xmath19 .",
    "constants implicit in landau or vinogradov symbols may depend on @xmath19 .",
    "note that this convention allows us to conclude from @xmath97 and @xmath98 that @xmath99 , for example .",
    "we make use of vector notation frequently , with some uncommon elements now to be described .",
    "boldface denotes vectors , with entries written in the corresponding italic font , and the dimension may vary from one occurrence to the next .",
    "when @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , we use @xmath103 to denote the @xmath104-tuple @xmath105 . also , we will have to permute the entries of a vector .",
    "let @xmath106 denote the symmetric group on @xmath66 elements .",

    "thus , for @xmath114 , the system of @xmath66 inequalities @xmath115 @xmath116 is abbreviated to @xmath117 .",
    "whenever @xmath118 for all @xmath93 with @xmath119 , we write @xmath120    the number of divisors of @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath121 , euler s totient function is @xmath122 , and the mbius function is @xmath123 .",
    "the highest common factor of @xmath124 and @xmath125 is @xmath126 .",
    "we put @xmath127 , and denote riemann s zeta function by @xmath128 .",
    "not only a few problems in the theory of numbers depend implicitly or explicitly on the asymptotic evaluation of the sum ( n ) = _ u_1u_2  u_kn h ( ) . here the dimension @xmath66 and the arithmetical function @xmath129 are intrinsic to the application at hand .",
    "perhaps the most familiar cases are the divisor problems of dirichlet and piltz where one chooses @xmath130 .",
    "as we have indicated in the introductory section of the present communication , the counting problems discussed in theorems [ thm01 ] and [ thm02 ] also reduce to sums of the type . yet , a successful treatment of the cognate box sums h(x_1, ",
    ",x_k ) = h()is often easier , in particular in cases where @xmath131 is the number of solutions of a certain diophantine system .",
    "typically , the condition on the product of the variables @xmath132 in will be in conflict with a direct use of the hardy - littlewood method for the diophantine problem at hand .    whenever the evaluation of the box sums is within the compass of existing technology , one is led to the question whether suitable asymptotic formulae for contain sufficient information to deduce an allied formula for @xmath133 .",
    "we shall provide an affirmative answer when @xmath134 takes real non - negative values only , and when the leading term in the asymptotic formula for @xmath135 is a pure power of @xmath136 .",
    "these conditions are not infrequently met in practice , and theorem [ s2.1 ] below should be useful in areas other than those discussed in this paper .",
    "however , it should be noted that the conditions on @xmath134 formulated in the preamble to theorem [ s2.1 ] have been tuned for our immediate needs .",
    "the underlying arguments work in broader generality .",
    "for example , if the leading term in an asmptotic formula for @xmath135 contains logarithms , these may be accommodated by the method now to be described . for another development of our ideas ,",
    "see schindler @xcite .",
