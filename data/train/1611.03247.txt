    "an important breakthrough occurred in the early 2000 s after realizing a rich integrable structure of the laplacian growth problem  @xcite .",
    "remarkable connections of the laplacian growth with integrable hierarchies and random matrices provide ample opportunities to address long - standing problems with novel methods .",
    "a particularly important example is a consolidation of the two - dimensional dyson gas theory  @xcite , quantum hall effect  @xcite , diffusion - limited aggregation , and laplacian growth within a single framework of the random matrix ensembles with complex eigenvalues .    when the size of the matrices , @xmath0 , becomes large",
    "some new features emerge , and the language of statistical equilibrium thermodynamics provides an adequate description of the matrix ensemble .",
    "different aspects of the @xmath1 expansion of the free - energy and density correlation functions were discussed in  @xcite . at large @xmath0",
    "the eigenvalues densely fill a domain in the complex plane ( the support of eigenvalues ) , and their density steeply drops down at the edge .    under a change of parameters of the random matrix ensemble and the size of matrices the support of eigenvalues grows in accordance with the laplacian growth law  @xcite .",
    "this growth , however , is an _",
    "( quasi - static ) process , as the passages between states in thermodynamic equilibrium are only considered  this is a limitation of the equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "_ this paper aims _ to apply common methods of non - equilibrium thermodynamics to the laplacian growth problem by taking into account small fluctuations of the parameters of the matrix ensembles , which occur close enough to equilibrium .",
    "this branch of thermodynamics , also known as the `` linear thermodynamics ''  @xcite , allows us to focus on transitions between thermodynamic states , represented by equilibrium distributions of eigenvalues within planar domains .",
    "the probability of transitions between different thermodynamic states ( or , equivalently , supports of eigenvalues ) is an essential step towards the path - integral formulation of the laplacian growth .",
    "_ structure of the paper is straightforward . _ after introducing the grand - canonical partition function of the two - dimensional dyson gas in the large @xmath0 limit , we derive the laplacian growth equation by maximizing the transitional probability between equilibrium states .",
    "afterwards , following einstein s theory of thermodynamic fluctuations  @xcite we determine the probability for occurring fluctuations of the parameter of the matrix ensemble .",

    "finally , we draw our conclusion and indicate some open problems .",
    "the grand - canonical partition function of the two - dimensional coulomb plasma ( often called the dyson gas  @xcite ) in the thermal equilibrium at `` temperature '' @xmath2 in the external potential , @xmath3 , is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lagrange multiplier , which fixes the total number of eigenvalues  , drop the inessential term @xmath6 , and rescale @xmath7 afterwards . ] , and the energy of the gas equals : @xmath8    a ) the electronic droplet in the external potential ; the point charges ( impurities ) are marked by @xmath9 .",

    "the two valuable interpretations of @xmath3 are : 1 ) @xmath14 is the electric potential created by _ impurities _ ( point electric charges  ) located in the exterior of @xmath10 ( fig",
    ".  [ droplet]a ) , and 2 ) @xmath3 is the potential generated by the _ background charge _ , which fills the domain @xmath15 with a unit density ( fig .",
    "[ droplet]b ) , i.e. @xmath16 in the interior and exterior of @xmath11 the potential @xmath3 admits the series expansions : @xmath17 the coefficients of the expansions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are the harmonic moments of @xmath11 : @xmath20    _ the mean values _ of symmetric functions of particle coordinates are defined in a usual way : @xmath21 some important examples of the symmetric functions are the logarithmic function , @xmath22 , and polynomials @xmath23 : @xmath24 in the large @xmath0 limit these functions become the harmonic moments of the support of eigenvalues @xmath10 , defined in a similar way to  .",
    "by @xmath25 and @xmath26 we will denote the compliment set of the harmonic moments of @xmath10 .",
    "at large @xmath0 and low enough temperature the dyson gas behaves as an incompressible charged liquid .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the short distance cutoff , @xmath27 , and define the quasiclassical limit as @xmath28 and @xmath29 while @xmath30 is kept fixed .",
    "then , the eigenvalues densely fill the domain @xmath10 in a complex plane , so that the mean density in the exterior of @xmath10 is exponentially small as @xmath28 .",
    "since the density of eigenvalues , is a smooth function in the large @xmath0 limit , the partition function of the dyson gas   can be symbolically rewritten as : @xmath31)}[d\\rho],\\ ] ] where is the area of @xmath10 , and we rescale @xmath32 for convenience .",
    "the energy of the dyson gas   can be written in terms of the density function . in the leading order",

    "all harmonic moments of the domains @xmath10 and @xmath11 are equal , except for @xmath39 ( or , equivalently , @xmath40 ) because of the term @xmath5 in  . if @xmath41 the domains @xmath10 and @xmath11 coincide ( fig .",

    "the @xmath1 corrections to the free energy emerge as the atomic structure of the dyson gas is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the language of statistical thermodynamics provides an adequate description of the dyson gas in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "one can introduce the entropy @xmath48   does not contribute to the entropy , as the charges are frozen at their equilibrium positions .",
    "non - trivial contributions to the entropy result from the discrete `` atomic '' structure of the dyson gas . ] , the internal energy @xmath49 , and external coordinates , which determine the configuration of the system  @xcite .",
    "these coordinates are the parameters of the external potential  , i.e.  @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , etc . by differentiating",
    "we obtain the _ fundamental thermodynamic relation _ , which relates changes of the entropy , the energy , and the generalized `` forces '' @xmath53 : @xmath54 where we took into account the mean values of the `` forces '' , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , in the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the _ adiabatic _ ( quasi - static ) variations of the parameters of the potential , @xmath3 , cause the evolution of the support of eigenvalues , that is a motion of @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamical law , which governs the evolution , is incorporated in the extremum condition . by differentiating   w.r.t .",
    "@xmath57 and replacing @xmath47 by the characteristic function of @xmath10 , we obtain the functional equation for the support of the eigenvalues @xmath10 : @xmath58 taking time derivative of   we arrive to the celebrated laplacian growth equation  @xcite , @xmath59 written in terms of the schwarz function , @xmath60 , for the boundary @xmath61   away from the contour  @xcite . ] , and of the complex potential , @xmath62 , which determines the change of the external potential   with time   if @xmath63 . ] .",
    "following the einstein s theory of thermodynamic fluctuations  @xcite the probability of the fluctuation , @xmath64 , is determined by the entropy difference @xmath65 between two thermodynamic states .",
    "the change of the entropy of the system , @xmath66 , can be calculated using the minimal reversible work , @xmath67 , which has to be applied to bring the system out of equilibrium . for @xmath67",
    "one can use the expression  @xcite : @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath19 , @xmath26 are the equilibrium values of temperature , harmonic moments , and the area of the liquid droplet . using the fundamental thermodynamic relation   we find in the quadratic approximation the probability for occurring fluctuations of the thermodynamic variables : @xmath71    the large @xmath0 limit of the dyson gas corresponds to a very low temperature , when the charges are frozen at their equilibrium positions and their fluctuations are negligible .",
    "thus , we will consider the classical fluctuations at the constant temperature , @xmath72 , only .",
    "remarkably , the highly - unstable and non - equilibrium laplacian growth can be considered as small ( gaussan ) fluctuations near equilibrium in the beta - ensemble of complex eigenvalues .",
    "different ways of adding new particles to the system result into different growth processes .",
    "a particular important example is an aggregation of diffusing particles issued from the source at infinity .",
    "since the particles can freely arrive to the system to compensate the background charge , we have @xmath73 and @xmath74 at the thermodynamics equilibrium  .    _ the deterministic growth _",
    ", we introduce first , serves as a reference point in the space of all growth processes .",
    "it is caused by a specific variation of the background potential , when all @xmath18 s ( except @xmath70 ) are kept fixed .",
    "the new particles arrive to the system from the distant source to compensate the change of @xmath3 .",
    "being attached to the boundary of @xmath10 with a rate proportional to the local electric field , they cause the growth of the support of eigenvalues . since changing of @xmath3 is a much faster process than adjusting of the domain @xmath10  , the chemical potential for newly incoming particles is non - zero and is given by  . expanding this formula in @xmath75",
    ", we obtain : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the conformal radius of @xmath11 .",
    "usually , the conformal radius is defined by the conformal map , @xmath79 , from the compliment to the unit disk to the exterior of @xmath11 .",
    "the map is normalized so that @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is real and positive , i.e. @xmath82    representing the logarithm of the conformal radius as the solution to the dirichlet boundary problem  , where @xmath83 is the green s function of the dirichlet boundary problem in the exterior of @xmath11  @xcite , and @xmath84 at the boundary . ]",
    ", we recast the chemical potential   in the form :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the inverse to the conformal map  , and @xmath87 is a normal displacement of the boundary , @xmath88 , due to the change @xmath89 .",
    "the newly attached particles cause the growth of @xmath10 with the normal velocity , @xmath90 , which prompts the darcy s law , where @xmath91 is the rate of the growth .",
    "thus , the evolution of the interface follows the _ deterministic laplacian growth dynamics _ : @xmath92 where @xmath93 parametrizes the boundary . by plugging @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 to",
    ", we conclude that the deterministic laplacian growth   maximizes the probability .    _ the stochastic growth processes _ deviate from the deterministic laplacian growth dynamics   by random fluctuations of the interface during the evolution .",
    "these fluctuations are generated by newly arrived particles , which tend to compensate the change of the parameters of the external potential , @xmath97 , caused by variations of the impurities ( fig .",
    "[ droplet]a ) .",
    "the latter are related by the richardson theorem  @xcite : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the position of @xmath100-th impurity , and @xmath101 is its rate of change of the charge .",
    "the corresponding interface dynamics is then described by the _",
    "stochastic laplacian growth equation _ : @xmath102 where @xmath103 are the inverse pre - images of @xmath104 inside the unit disk .",
    "this equation is well known in the classical laplacian growth problem in the presence of point - like hydrodynamical sources @xmath101 at the points @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "the general formula   determines the small fluctuations of various thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the harmonic moments , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as the coefficients of the multipole expansion of the potential  , are interrelated via a certain potential function  @xcite : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the logarithm of the tau - function of the boundary curve  @xcite , @xmath107 which also provides a solution to the dispersionless limit of the 2d integrable toda hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry relations between the harmonic moments suggest to chose @xmath18 s as independent variables .",
    "variations of @xmath18 s also cause the deviation of the chemical potential for newly incoming particles from its `` deterministic '' value  .",
    "since @xmath108 we transform the line integral in   in the contour one .",
    "the laplacian growth equation   relates the change of schwarz function with the variation of the electric potential : @xmath109   is a regular in @xmath11 part of the schwarz function @xmath110 . ] .",
    "thus , evaluating the contour integrals we determine the variation of the chemical potential : @xmath111    now , using the symmetry relation   one can express @xmath112 s in terms of @xmath113 s to transform the probability for occurring fluctuation   in the quadratic form in @xmath113 and @xmath114 only .",
    "as for the term @xmath115 ,  .",
    "] we use   and take into account description of the conformal map , @xmath86 , in terms of the tau - function  @xcite , which leads to the formula : @xmath116 thus allowing to express @xmath117 through @xmath113 s  . as discussed earlier , the variations of @xmath18 s are caused by fluctuations of the impurities in the exterior of @xmath10   ( fig .  [",
    "droplet]a ) .",
    "thus , the quadratic form in the exponent of   ( upon rewriting in terms of @xmath18 s ) includes the cross terms of the form @xmath118 .",
    "this terms , however , do not contribute to the mean fluctuation values of any quantities , if the statistical independence of impurities , @xmath119 for @xmath120 , is assumed . under these circumstances",
    "the probability for occurring fluctuations can be written in the form  : @xmath121 _ the mean square fluctuations of the harmonic moments _",
    ", @xmath122 then are determined by the coefficients of the quadratic form in the exponent of  , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the elements of the inverse matrix",
    ". the mean square fluctuation of @xmath112 s are obtained from   by virtue of the symmetry relation  .",
    "it also follows from   that the area of the droplet does not fluctuate with time , as we consider fluctuations of the shape of the interface against the background of the growth process with a constant rate .      if growth continues until time @xmath125 ( @xmath126 is integer ) the associated probability of the process",
    "is given by the product of the _ conditional probabilities _",
    ": @xmath127 since @xmath128 depends solely ( through the tau - taunction ) on the present domain at time  @xmath129 , the product in   is a markovian chain . in the limit @xmath130 by summing the exponents of the probabilities we obtain : @xmath131    remarkably , the exponent in   is the action for a non - relativistic massless particle on the infinite dimensional complex manifold with the khler metric  , so @xmath106 is the khler potential  @xcite .",
    "although the growth of the support of eigenvalues was treated as response to the variation of the external potential , one can forget the details of this derivation and consider the growth probability on its own . then , assuming that fluctuations of the interface during evolution are inevitable features of the unstable laplacian growth , formula   allows to compare probabilities of different growth scenarios , which lead to the same final domain starting , e.g. , from the ideal circle .",
    "under these circumstances the path - integral formulation did what it was supposed to do by indicating the most probable growth scenario .",
    "application of methods of the statistical mechanics to stochastic growth phenomena might throw new light on the long - standing problems . in this paper",
    "we have touched only the laplacian growth , because of its impressively wide applicability ranging from solidification and oil recovery to biological growth . also , it possesses beautiful and powerful properties , unusual for most of nonlinear pdes , such as infinitely many conservation laws and closed form exact solutions .",
    "a particularly important new result is an explicit calculation of the growth probability  , which turns out to be the propagator of a free - particle on the infinite dimensional complex manifold with the khler metric . in the light of this simple result",
    "several natural questions come to the surface .",
    "does this manifold possesses new interesting mathematics , owing to the fact that the khler potential is the logarithm of the tau - function of the two - dimensional integrable toda hierarchy ?",
    "what are the geodesics in this space ? what is their role from the laplacian growth point of view ? and so on .",
    "remarkably , the fluctuation theory of the laplacian growth also has a rich mathematical structure if to use a dual description of lg ( known as the inverse potential problem ) in terms of the conformal maps .",
    "here we only mention some results , while the details can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the probability of the fluctuations   generalizes the result of  @xcite , where the semiclassical one - particle wave function at the boundary of the electronic droplet for @xmath132 was calculated , to the case of the non - vanishing ( in the limit @xmath133 ) stochastic growth of the droplet .",
    "being written in terms of the singularities of the conformal map , the growth probability resembles the semiclassical correlation function of the exponential operators in the liouville conformal field theory on a pseudoshere .",
    "thus , the semiclassical corrections to growth probability might provide a deep insight in the link between laplacian growth and conformal field theories first noted in  @xcite .",
    "the most important missing pieces of the construction is a distribution function for stochastic impurities .",
    "there are strong reasons to believe that fluctuations in the laplacian growth do not decay exponentially with time in contrast to the usual fluctuation theory .",
    "once this issue is resolved , the role of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the laplacian growth will be much more clear .",
