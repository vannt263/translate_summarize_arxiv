    "billiards have attracted much attention in the recent decades as simple dynamical systems in classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "depending on shapes of boundary , statistical property of billiards varies from integrable to strongly chaotic .",
    "plane polygonal billiards , or simply , polygonal billiards , is a typical class that is neither chaotic nor integrable except to a few integrable cases ( regular triangular , ( @xmath0)-triangular , ( @xmath1)-triangular and rectangular tables only make their billiards integrable ) .",
    "dynamics of billiards in a typical polygon is conjectured to be ergodic on the three dimensional energy surfaces . while dynamics of billiards in rational polygons are restricted to two dimensional invariant surfaces as same as integrable systems , but genuses of the invariant surfaces are larger than 1 ( except to integrable cases ) .",
    "therefore billiards in rational polygons are characterized as pseudointegrable @xcite .",
    "it is rigorously proven that the dynamics on these surfaces are ergodic and not mixing @xcite .",
    "every pseudointegrable system has continuous component of spectrum and may ( or may not ) have _ non - trivial _ discrete one because of its non - integrable and non - chaotic properties . here",
    "a non - trivial discrete component of spectrum means a discrete one which does not correspond to almost everywhere constant functions .",
    "it turns out that a dynamics without non - trivial discrete component of spectrum has weak mixing property . here",
    "weak mixing property for a finite ergodic measure @xmath2 is defined as follows : if the condition @xmath3 is held for any @xmath2-square integrable functions @xmath4 , then it is said that the system has ( measure theoretical ) weak mixing property . here",
    "@xmath5 denotes @xmath6 , which represents the inner product on the hilbert space composed of @xmath7-square integrable functions . a weak mixing dynamics without stronger mixing has singular continuous spectrum .",
    "weak mixing is believed to be generic for billiards in rational polygons , or more generally , for geodesic flows on translation surfaces which is explained in next section , but this was only shown for _ horizontal - vertical polygons _ or _ horizontal - vertical translation surfaces_. ( see the appendix . ) note that the genericity of weak mixing property in the parameter space of translation flows on translation surfaces is recently proved by a. avila and g. forni @xcite .",
    "a horizontal - vertical polygon is a polygon all of whose sides are in horizontal or vertical direction , and a horizontal - vertical translation surface is , roughly speaking , an oriented surface constructed as compact subset on euclidian 2d space with edges @xmath8 where for each @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are parallel and have the same length , and each pair @xmath12 are topologically connected to each other and each `` jump '' from @xmath11 to @xmath10 is horizontal or vertical in covering space . any other results for weak mixing were obtained numerically , see the `` square - ring billiard '' @xcite ; see also related numerical studies on rational @xcite and irrational triangles @xcite .",
    "billiard in a horizontal - vertical polygon whose ratio of length of horizontal or vertical sides are rational respectively are called to be almost integrable ( or a - integrable ) billiard .",
    "we can extend this concept for horizontal - vertical translation sufaces ; for horizontal - vertical translation surface , if the ratio of length of horizontal or vertical `` jump '' are rational respectively , then we call the translation surface almost integrable",
    ". dynamics of almost integrable billiards have intensively studied , especially the dynamics of barrier billiards are well understood , having both discrete and singular continuous spectrum @xcite and calculability to fractal dimension ( or decay rate of power - law correlation ) of trajectries with quadratic irrational gradients were rigorously proven @xcite , and self - similarity of a trajectry were reported @xcite ; see also references therein .    in this article , the author report a new example of pseudointegrable systems with weak mixing , although the system is not horizontal - vertical type . to the best of the author",
    "s knowledge , this is the first time to give an explicit example of pseudointegrable systems with weak mixing without horizontal - vertical property .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the concept of translation surface which appears as invariant surfaces of billiard flows on rational polygons .",
    "the concept of translation surface will be used as more general meaning in section 4 and 5 , that is , as orientable surface which have finitely many punctures and have flat metric exept to the punctures . in section 3",
    "we describe the concept of interval exchange , and then we review veech s weak mixing theorem for interval exchange @xcite which gives us a sufficient condition to weak mixing for interval exchanges . in section 4 the main result",
    "is stated , the sufficient condition to have weak mixing property for pseudointegrable systems is stated . here",
    "the concept of pseudointegrability is extended to dynamics of geodesic flows on translation surfaces . to make sense of this sufficient condition , an example",
    "whose weak mixing is proved by the condition is proposed in section 5 .",
    "the conclusion is stated in section 6 . in appendix",
    "we review spectral properties of horizontal - vertical billiards .",
    "let @xmath13 be a plane polygon , and let @xmath14 be phase space of the billiard inside @xmath13 .",
    "then we can denote @xmath15 , here @xmath16 represents the space of velocities . because of motions of billiards , absolute value of velocity @xmath17 is conservative on time evolution , so @xmath18 are invariant , where @xmath19 is defined by fixing the absolute value of velocity to @xmath17 , and each @xmath20 is equivalent to @xmath21 , which means @xmath22 , apart from time scaling .",
    "so we should only treat the dynamics on @xmath21 . from here , @xmath23 will be used instead of @xmath21 as the phase space .",
    "clearly , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 stands for set of directions .",
    "if @xmath13 is a rational polygon , any orbit on @xmath23 has finite directions .",
    "for example , there exist four directions in generic orbit of rectangular or barrier billiards , while there exist six directions in generic orbit of regular triangular billiards .",
    "each of these numbers of directions is equal to order of coxseter group @xmath26 of the billiard table @xmath13 . here",
    "coxseter group is a discrete group each of whose elements is a rotation or a reflection acting on @xmath25 . and @xmath26 is defined as the group generated by reflections on the sides of @xmath13 .",
    "we can construct the invariant surfaces @xmath27 for @xmath28 with @xmath29 . naturally , if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 . in the cases of rectangular or barrier ( or more generally ,",
    "horizontal - vertical ) billiards , for example , @xmath26 is generated by @xmath32 and @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 represents order of the set",
    ".    flows on @xmath35 for generic @xmath36 can be thought as geodesic flows on a riemannian surface @xmath37 with flat metric except to finitely many punctures .",
    "such a surface is called _",
    "translation surface_. let @xmath38 be sides of @xmath13 and let @xmath39 be the reflection on @xmath38",
    ". then the translation surfaces @xmath37 related to rational polygons @xmath13 is defined as follow ;    translation surfaces of rational polygons _ the translation surface @xmath37 of @xmath13 is a topological surface with a metric defined as follows : + * 1 .",

    "metric sense .",
    "* the metric on @xmath37 is defined as flat metric except to the vertices . _",
    "for generic @xmath46 , flow @xmath47 is equivalent to geodesic flows on @xmath37 directed to @xmath36 .",
    "and geodesic flows on @xmath37 directed to generic directions are ergodic .",
    "note that an orbit having less than @xmath48 directions in @xmath23 may correspond to two or more orbits in @xmath37 , but they are out of discussions in this article because such orbits are peiodic and not generic .",
    "let @xmath49 be a segment or a straight loop in a translation surface @xmath50 and let @xmath36 be a direction transversal to @xmath49 .",
    "then the return map onto @xmath49 of the translation flow @xmath51 is a interval exchange , which will be defined in next section .",

    "( [ veech ] ) _ does not admit any nonzero measurable solution . _    with @xmath98 , this sufficient condition for weak mixing works on interval exchanges .    in next section , how this theorem works on pseudointegrable systems is described .",
    "let @xmath99 be an ergodic component of a translation surface @xmath50 , and @xmath49 be a segment or a straight loop on @xmath50 transversal to @xmath36 .",
    "then the return map of @xmath99 onto @xmath49 is an interval exchange @xmath66 with @xmath59 disconnected points , where @xmath59 is the number of punctures of @xmath50 .",
    "it is obvious from the construction of @xmath66 that the length of @xmath49 is equal to @xmath64 , and for each connecting component @xmath100 , any points @xmath101 are contemporaneously returned onto @xmath49 by flows on @xmath99 .",
    "so the characteristic value problem of unitary operator @xmath102 @xmath103 on the translation flow @xmath99 on @xmath50 is reduced on the interval exchange @xmath104 on @xmath49 as the form of @xmath105 in the equation ( [ continuouseigen ] ) and ( [ discreteeigen ] ) , @xmath106 , @xmath107 are defined as @xmath108 , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the time evolution by the flow of @xmath99 and as @xmath111 , @xmath112 respectively , @xmath113 in ( [ discreteeigen ] ) corresponds to @xmath114 in ( [ continuouseigen ] ) as @xmath115 and @xmath116 in ( [ discreteeigen ] ) is defined from @xmath91 in ( [ continuouseigen ] ) by restricting onto @xmath49 ; @xmath117 to compare ( [ veech ] ) and ( [ discreteeigen ] ) , we can observe that the equation ( [ discreteeigen ] ) is of the form ( [ veech ] ) .",
    "therefore veech s weak mixing theorem works on @xmath99 in the sense describing bellow .    for ergodic @xmath99 ,",
    "the map @xmath66 on any @xmath49 is naturally ergodic and , therefore , the permutation @xmath61 is irreducible .",
    "so , it is true from veech s weak mixing theorem that    _ for @xmath66 on @xmath49 induced from an ergodic @xmath99 , if @xmath118 satisfies the condition @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the positive vector whose @xmath42-th component is defined as @xmath121 in _ ( [ phi ] ) , _ then _ ( [ continuouseigen ] ) _ for @xmath99 does nt have the characteristic value @xmath114 and , moreover , does nt have the @xmath122 for any @xmath123 .",
    "_    this collorary is available only if @xmath124 exists for some @xmath118 .",

    "so , such an ergodic component is weakly mixing .",
    "for the last of this section , let us summarize the above condition to weak mixing ;    a sufficient condition for weak mixing _ if @xmath125 exist such that @xmath126 and @xmath127 are linearly independent with integral coefficients , then the flow @xmath99 is weak mixing on the ergodic component . _",
    "[ maintheorem ]    to indicate the availavility of this condition we will show an example of weak mixing pseudointegrable system whose weak mixing property is supported from above condition of weak mixing .",
    "in this section , we show an algorithm to construct pseudointegrable systems with weak mixing based on the sufficient condition in the last section .",
    "note that this algorithm is incomplete to construct such systems in many points .",
    "to construct such a system , first , we must find such a permutation @xmath61 that there exist @xmath78 and @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) and they are linearly independent .",
    "since @xmath133 , @xmath134 must be @xmath135 .",
    "as such an example of @xmath61 , let us choose @xmath136 next , we must find a corresponding translation surface @xmath50 , a direction of flow @xmath36 and a segment ( or the loop ) @xmath49 , of which permutation @xmath61 of the interval exchange @xmath66 will become the permutation finded above . for our example of @xmath99 and @xmath49 corresponding to our permutation ( [ permutation ] ) , let us choose them as describing in     and for the other parameters as generic .",
    "each pair of vectors @xmath137 are identified each other .",
    "this system is parametrized by the 2d vectors @xmath137 . and",
    "the outer square is unit square and horizontal or vertical sides of this square are identified respectively.,height=188 ]    fig.[figa ] and as @xmath138-axis .",
    "the last , we must check whether there exist @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( @xmath132 ) such that they are linearly independent with integral coefficients .",
    "if they exist , then it is supposed by theorem [ maintheorem ] that the flow @xmath99 is weak mixing . for our case ,",
    "weak mixing is immediately proven for generic parameters .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath99 is ergodic if horizontal components of @xmath139 are linearly independent with integral coefficients , and in addidion if vertical component of @xmath140 is irrational , then @xmath99 is weak mixing .",
    "on pseudointegrable systems , we were able to show weak mixing property only for horizontal - vertical cases . on the other hand ,",
    "veech s weak mixing theorem for interval exhange was used only for a - integrable systems to prove that the complement spectra of immediately given discrete component is singular continuous @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the author established that veech s weak mixing theorem ( theorem [ veechsweakmixing ] ) can be applicable to pseudointegrable systems for proving their weak mixing property , and that is stated as theorem [ maintheorem ] to make sense of theorem [ maintheorem ] , it is proposed that there really exists a translation flow of a translation surface whose weak mixing property is supported by this theorem .",
    "furthermore , this translation surface is not horizontal - vertical type .",
    "this approach to weak mixing for pseudointegrable systems is the defferent way from previous works in this field .",
    "the example which is proposed in section 5 is not billiard system , so it is still opened whether there exist some examples whose weak mixing property is supported by this theorem .",
    "note that this aproach has further problems .",
    "first , theorem [ maintheorem ] gives us only the sufficient condition for weak mixing property .",
    "second , the algorithm shown in section 5 is incomplete too , in other words , even if the algorithm failed with some segment @xmath49 in @xmath50 , the algorithm may succeed with other segment @xmath49 .",
    "to improve the first incompleteness , we have to extend veech s weak mixing theorem ( theorem [ veechsweakmixing ] ) to sufficient and necessary condition . and to improve the second incompleteness , we have to study the relation between interval exchange transformations on different segments in the same translation surface .",
    "the author would like to thank tetsuro konishi for checking this paper and giving many helpful advices for the author , and to thank masashi tachikawa for recommending this subject to the author .",
    "in this section , we show the spectral properties of horizontal - vertical translation surfaces , whose definition is already stated in section 2 . we discuss only about the translation surfaces described in fig.[figb ] , but any other cases can be discussed similarly .",
    "let @xmath50 be the translation surface described in fig.[figb ] and @xmath36 be the direction of which @xmath99 is ergodic flow .",
    "then the flow @xmath99 is almost integrable if and only if @xmath142 is rational .",
    "as the almost integrable case , let us choose the parameters @xmath143 in fig.[figb ] as @xmath144 .",
    "the vector field on @xmath99 is @xmath145 uniformly .",
    "therefore the eigenequation ( [ continuouseigen ] ) admits infinitly many eigenfunctions @xmath146 @xmath147 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath148 here @xmath149 , which appeared in section 3 . any other eigenfunction could nt be admitted by the equation ( [ continuouseigen ] ) . to prove this ,",
    "let @xmath150 be the subspace spanned by the eigenfunctions ( [ eigenfunction ] ) .",
    "then the orthogonal complement subspace @xmath151 is decomposed into two subspaces @xmath152 and @xmath153 which are orthogonal to each other . where @xmath154 , are spanned by @xmath155 respectively .",
    "suppose @xmath156 and @xmath157 , then @xmath158 is obvious from ergodicity , and @xmath159 is immediately obtained by the definition of @xmath160 .",
    "moreover @xmath91 have to be @xmath161 or @xmath162 because if there exist @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) such that @xmath166 , then @xmath167 is also eigenfunction , however , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , so both @xmath170 and @xmath171 are the eigenfunctions having the same eigenvalue because of the invariance of @xmath172 under the action @xmath173 , this situation is impossible because of erogodicity .",
    "so , we suppose that @xmath174 ( or @xmath175 ) .",
    "its orbit @xmath176 have to be @xmath161 ( @xmath162 , respectively ) in any @xmath177 .",
    "for any point @xmath178 , we can take the positive numbers @xmath179 such that @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the @xmath182-neighberhood of @xmath183 , and @xmath184 for any @xmath185 , and @xmath186 .",
    "then , for @xmath187 and @xmath188 it is clear that @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "so we can conclude that @xmath191 , here @xmath192 , have to be equal to @xmath193 , thus @xmath194 .",
    "we may conclude the same result for @xmath195 by the same way .",
    "so , @xmath196 , and thus , @xmath197 , but such a function could nt be an eignfunction . therefore , we obtain the result that any other eigenfunction does no exist .    in the case of",
    "that @xmath142 is irrational , there is the sequence @xmath198 which is the rational approximation by continued fraction . in each case of @xmath199 , the system is a - integrable and there is the subspace @xmath200 which is spanned by the eigenfunctions . in each @xmath201 , @xmath50 is devided to @xmath202 copies of fundamental rectangle .",
