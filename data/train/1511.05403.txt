    "low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) is perhaps the most developed extension of the standard model of ( sm ) of particle physics  @xcite .",
    "while , inherent in supersymmetry , a technically natural solution to the gauge hierarchy problem implies the sm superpartners are at or below the tev energy scale , other and much lighter new particles can exist as well .",
    "in particular , if supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at not very high energy scales ( see models with gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking @xcite as an example ) , the particles from the susy breaking sector may show up at quite low energies .",
    "their effective couplings to the sm particles are anticipated to be rather weak ; therefore a high intensity beam is required to test the model via production of the new particles .",
    "the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) provides us with a high intensity beam of 400 gev protons , and the recently proposed beam - dump search for hidden particles ( ship ) experiment @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) can perform the task ( see ref.@xcite for a comprehensive discussion of the ship physics case ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to estimate the signal rate expected at the ship experiment in supersymmetric models with sufficiently light particles of _ the goldstino supermultiplet_. the latter contains _ goldstino _ ( the nambu  goldstone field , fermion ) and its superpartners , _ scalar and pseudoscalar sgoldstinos_. while goldstinos are @xmath0 odd , sgoldstinos are @xmath0 even and hence can be singly produced in scatterings of the sm particles and can subsequently decay into the sm particles .",
    "of particular interest are the sgoldstino decays into two electrically charged sm particles .",
    "these decays yield the signature well recognizable at ship @xcite : two charged tracks from a single vertex supplemented with a peak in the invariant mass of outgoing particles .",
    "sgoldstino couplings to the sm fields are inversely proportional to the parameter of the order of the squared scale of susy breaking in the whole model .",
    "this unique feature of the goldstino supermultiplet allows us to probe the susy breaking scale by hunting for the light sgoldstinos .",
    "a preliminary estimate of the sgoldstino signal for a particular production mechanism and decay channel can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we significantly extend that study by considering both scalar and pseudoscalar sgoldstinos and by investigating both flavor - conserving and flavor - violating sgoldstino couplings to the sm fermions , which cover various sgoldstino production mechanisms and decay modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec:1 ] contains the sgoldstino effective lagrangian .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] are devoted to ship phenomenology of scalar and pseudoscalar sgoldstinos , respectively .",
    "here we discuss direct ( secs .",

    "if supersymmetry exists , it is spontaneously broken in order to be phenomenologically viable@xcite .",
    "the breaking happens when a hidden sector dynamics gives a nonzero vacuum expectation value @xmath1 to an auxiliary component of a superfield .",
    "the dimension of this parameter is mass squared , and @xmath2 is of order of the susy breaking scale .",
    "the fermion component of this superfield , goldstino @xmath3 , becomes a longitudinal component of the gravitino as a result of the super - higgs mechanism making the gravitino massive ( for details see ref .",
    "goldstino superpartners , scalar @xmath4 and pseudoscalar @xmath5 sgoldstinos gain masses @xmath6 due to higher order corrections from the khler potential .",
    "the masses are largely model dependent and we merely keep them as free parameters in the ( sub-)gev range for this study .",

    "lagrangian includes only single - sgoldstino terms ; considered in refs.@xcite , two - sgoldstino terms are suppressed by @xmath26 and are less promising for testing at the ship experiment . in the interesting range of @xmath1 here ,",
    "the gravitino is very light and can be safely replaced by its goldstino component @xmath27 , entering , whenever sgoldstino phenomenology at the beam - dump experiment is considered .",
    "hence , sgoldstino couplings to the sm fields are proportional to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) .",
    "sgoldstinos also mix with neutral higgs bosons as described in refs.@xcite : the scalar sgoldstino @xmath4 mixes with neutral light @xmath28 and heavy @xmath29 higgs bosons , while pseudoscalar @xmath5 mixes with axial higgs @xmath30 . in what follows",
    "we only account for the first mixing , since the other two do not change the sgoldstino phenomenology at ship for the set of models we investigate . mixing of the sgoldstino and lightest mssm higgs boson ( sm - like higgs ) @xmath28 can be written as@xcite @xmath31 where the mixing parameter @xmath32 is related to the higgsino mixing mass parameter @xmath33 , the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath34gev , the parameter @xmath35 describing the higgs vev ratio , and @xmath22 and @xmath21 gauge coupling constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 as follows @xmath38 we consider sgoldstino @xmath4 to be much lighter than the sm - like higgs boson of mass @xmath39gev .",

    "is responsible for the light inflaton production at the fixed target experiment with a 400 gev proton beam . for the mssm parameters from table[mssmpoint ]",
    "we find the following numerical approximation to the cross section as a function of the sgoldstino mass and supersymmetry breaking parameter , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the total @xmath57 cross section for the @xmath58 gev proton beam .",
