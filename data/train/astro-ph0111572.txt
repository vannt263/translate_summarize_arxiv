    "note that a correction of 0.35 dex , which corresponds to the correction at the temperature of the sun , was applied to the abundances deduced from the permitted lines of o i in the sun to compute its [ o / fe ] in the same way as for our m71 sample of stars .",

    "we estimated the error in the @xmath12  to be 10% for all the lines .",
    "the error of the synthesis of the li doublet is estimated to be @xmath100.1 dex .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab6 ] , where the range adopted for each parameter is representative of its uncertainty .    because of the high excitation of the c i lines studied here , this is the ion included in our analysis whose derived abundance is most sensitive to @xmath2 .",

    "while the form of the relationship appears to be more or less universal , figure  [ na_o ] suggests that the amplitude of the na / o anti - correlation among rgb stars is smallest for the two most metal rich globular clusters shown , 47 tuc ( where the published dataset is very small ) and m71 , as well as for ngc 6397 .",
    "the abundance of al is also known to vary from star - to - star within a globular cluster . because the al doublet at 6697  is not included in the spectral coverage of the primary set of hires spectra ( see paper i ) , it can be measured only in a subset of the sample of stars studied here .",

    "no anti - correlation is detected in 47 tuc , where the database is very sparse .",
    "the differences among the family of linear fits to the al / na relationship for various globular clusters shown in figure  [ al_na ] appear at first sight to be considerably larger than those shown by the fits to the na / o anti - correlation in figure  [ na_o ] .",
    "we suggest that these differences may not be real , and may arise from non - lte effects in al acting on the different ranges of luminosities of stars studied in each cluster as well as the particular selection of al lines used in each analysis .",
    "the situation in ngc 6752 is particularly illuminating .",
    "et al . _  ( 2001 ) ascribe the very different mean al abundances deduced for the subgiants and for the main sequence stars in the cluster precisely to this issue of ignoring non - lte in the spectrum of aluminium .",
    "li is a very fragile element and is very easily destroyed in stars , burning at @xmath37 k. @xcite discovered the presence of li in warm halo dwarfs at a constant value ( log @xmath16(li ) = 2.24 ) and suggested that this represents the primordial li synthesized in the big bang , thus of considerable importance to cosmology .",
    "destruction of li is a measure of the depth of the surface convection zone , and hence a strong function of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite compile recent observations for li in galactic disk and halo stars and review the galactic chemical evolution of li , while @xcite reviews the destruction of li from a theoretical perspective .",
    "we therefore expect li to be depleted among the rgb and subgiant stars in globular clusters , although probably not among the main sequence stars .",
    "in addition , there is at least one case known in a globular cluster of the extremely rare class of very li - rich stars .",
    "a possible explanation for this star , found as a bright rgb star in m3 by @xcite , and similar objects is given by @xcite .",
    "the li line is not included in the spectral coverage of the primary set of spectra ( see paper i ) , and hence can be measured only in a subset of the sample of m71 stars studied here .",
    "we were able to obtain log @xmath16(li ) for three giants fainter than the hb , as well as several upper limits .",
    "the mean log @xmath16(li ) for the detections is 1.10@xmath100.16 ( on the scale h=12.0 dex ) , which is 0.8 dex less than the mean log @xmath16(li ) ( 1.90 @xmath10 0.42 ) for a sample of 11 halo dwarf stars of similar [ fe / h ] from the sample of @xcite , and is evidence of the strong depletion among the cooler stars in which li was detected here .",
    "figure  [ li1 ] illustrates the pattern of detections and upper limits , which are consistent with our overall expectations .",
    "the analysis of c i lines in cool stars is difficult as the lines are weak , and their excitation potential is high , @xmath368.5 ev .",
    "furthermore , the c i lines near 7115  are not included in the spectral coverage of the primary set of spectra ( see paper i ) , and hence can be measured only in a subset of the sample studied here .",
    "we have reliable detections in only 6 stars , 2 lines in 1 star , and 1 line each in the other 5 stars .",
    "these , with considerable uncertainty , show a large star - to - star scatter in deduced c abundance .",
    "however , the c i lines in stars with @xmath2  @xmath38 k may be blended with or completely dominated by lines from the red system of cn , as illustrated in the spectrum of arcturus by @xcite .",
    "it is very likely that this has happened , as there are two cool stars in our sample , m71 1 - 45 and 1 - 66 , with anomalously high deduced c abundances .",
    "the measurements of @xcite show that these two stars have much stronger cn lines than does m71 star i , a star of similar @xmath2 which yielded a much more reasonable c abundance .",
    "unpublished measurements of the g band of ch in these three stars by jgc also suggest that the very large c abundances we deduce for m71 1 - 45 and 1 - 66 are spurious .",
    "the molecular band data gives a much clearer picture of the pattern of c abundance variation in m71 as the samples are much larger and the c abundance can be inferred with considerable precision from the strength of the ch band .",
    "both the ch and cn bands clearly show strong star - to - star variations on the m71 giant branch ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and , more importantly , at the level of the main sequence @xcite .",
    "the entire set of molecular band data can be explained by a variation in c of about a factor of 2 , with a much larger anti - correlated variation in the n abundance .      in figures",
    "[ new_comp1 ] to [ new_comp4 ] , for each element studied here we provide a comparison to similar high - resolution abundance analyses of halo dwarfs , of rgb stars in m4 ( [ fe / h]@xmath361.2 ) , rgb stars in m5 ( [ fe / h]@xmath361.2 ) , and rgb stars in m15 from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the halo dwarfs plotted in the figures have been selected from the sample of @xcite to have [ fe / h ] similar to m71 ( @xmath39[fe / h]@xmath40 ) .",
    "the boxes in figures  [ new_comp1 ] to [ new_comp4 ] follow the same layout as those in figure  [ summ_fig2 ] . the globular cluster name is indicated above each box ( h stands for the halo dwarf sample ) , and the number in parenthesis below the name indicates the number of stars used in the calculation of the respective abundance ratio .",
    "the median abundances for each element determined in each of the five different environments presented in figures  [ new_comp1 ] to [ new_comp4 ] agree to within the 1@xmath27 uncertainties of each measurement for most of the elements displayed , and agree to within @xmath41 for _ all _ the elements shown .",
    "aluminium is the element showing the largest trend with metallicity between these five environments .",
    "this is perhaps a consequence of not considering non - lte effects and of some studies including the 3961   doublet , known to be more sensitive to non - lte effects , and others not .",
    "barium is the only other element showing large variations in its median abundance among the various environments , although no consistent trend with metallicity .",
    "we suggest that this too may not be real , and may be a reflection of the issue of hyperfine structure corrections in the fairly strong lines of this element .",
    "overall m71 appears to have very similar abundance ratios as does m5 . in this set of figures ,",
    "one can see some of the well known trends characteristic of halo star abundances as reviewed by @xcite , such as the gradual increase of [ @xmath42/fe ] as [ fe / h ] decreases , particularly for si and ti .",
    "a classical review of post - main sequence stellar evolution can be found in @xcite .",
    "their description of the consequences of the first dredge up phase , the only dredge up phase any of the stars in our m71 sample may have experienced , indicates that a doubling of the surface n@xmath43 and a 30% reduction in the surface c@xmath44 can be expected , together with a drop in the ratio of c@xmath44/c@xmath45 from the solar value of 89 to @xmath3620 , as well as a drop in surface li and b by several orders of magnitude .",
    "observations of field stars over a wide range of luminosities conform fairly well to this picture , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , the o / na anti - correlation seen among the bright red giants in many globular clusters , including here in the case of m71 , can not be explained in this picture .",
    "several theoretical mechanisms have thus been proposed ( e.g. , the meridional mixing of sweigart & mengel 1979 , and turbulent diffusion of charbonnel 1994 , 1995 ) with varying degrees of success .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggested that the nuclear reaction @xmath46ne(@xmath47na occurs in regions of the h - burning shell for low mass stars where o is converted into n and produces na@xmath48 and al@xmath49 . @xcite",
    "combined these ideas to predict the consequences of such possible synthesis and deep mixing , including for example , that the surface mg abundance should be much less affected than that of na or al .",
    "these ideas form the basis of our current understanding of dredge up in low mass metal poor giants , with more recent calculations given by @xcite , among others .",
    "the clear prediction of this suite of calculations is that the earliest that deep mixing can begin is at the location of the bump in the luminosity function of the rgb which occurs when the h - burning shell crosses a sharp chemical discontinuity . @xcite",
    "have shown that the luminosity of the rgb bump as a function of metallicity as determined from observation agrees well with that predicted by the theory of stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite further suggest that the agreement between the predicted luminosity function and actual star counts along the rgb in the vicinity of the bump in a suite of globular clusters is so good that mixing ( more exactly , mixing of he ) can not have occurred any earlier , otherwise the evolutionary lifetimes , and hence the observed lf , of such stars would have been affected .",
    "our sample of m71 stars shows a statistically significant correlation between al and na abundances which extends to stars as faint as @xmath3 mag .",
    "we also see an anti - correlation between the na and o abundances extending down to near the main sequence turn off .",
    "we see variations in li ( as expected ) , and may see variations in zr ( not expected ) .",
    "any variations in mg are smaller than those of al , na or o ( as expected ) .",
    "we know there are large anti - correlated c and n variations from the work of @xcite ; this too is expected .",
    "the behavior of li , which is very fragile and easily destroyed , is not controversial .",
    "it is , however , the range of luminosity over which the remainder of these variations are seen which is becoming more and more of a problem for any scenario which invokes dredge up and mixing .",
    "the na / o anti - correlation we see in m71 extends to the main sequence turn off .",
    "the al / na correlation we see in m71 extends to at least as faint as @xmath3 , while the rgb bump in a cluster of the metallicity of m71 is at @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite has shown that the c / n anti - correlation extends to the stars at the main sequence turnoff and even fainter in m71 . @xcite",
    "have shown that the c / n abundance range seen at the level of the main sequence is comparable to that seen among the bright red giants of m71 by many previous studies , the most recent of which is @xcite .    the accumulated weight of recent evidence , both in m71 as described above and in other globular clusters such as 47 tuc ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and ngc 6752 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , suggests that we are now back in the situation we were during the late 1980s .",
    "unless we have missed some important aspect of stellar evolution with impact on mixing and dredge up , we must declare the mixing scenario a failure for the specific case of m71 ( and several other globular clusters as well ) .",
    "even the theoreticians in the forefront of this field are beginning to admit that deep mixing alone is not sufficient @xcite .",
    "unless and until some major new concept relevant to this issue appears , we must now regard the fundamental origin of the star - to - star variations we see in m71 as arising outside the stars whose spectra we have studied here .",
    "we present results of a high dispersion analysis of 23 elements to obtain abundance ratios for 25 members of the galactic globular cluster m71 .",
    "our sample of stars includes 19 giant stars ( 9 of which are less luminous than the rhb ) , 3 horizontal branch stars , and 3 stars near the main sequence turnoff .",
    "our conclusions are summarized as follows :    * the iron peak and neutron capture element abundance ratios show no trend with @xmath2 , and low scatter around the mean . * the @xmath1elements mg , ca , si and ti are overabundant relative to fe . the scatter about",
    "the mean is small . *",
    "an anti - correlation between the na and o abundances for stars in m71 is detected with a statistical significance in excess of 2@xmath27 , and extends to the stars near the main sequence turn off . *",
    "the [ na / fe ] versus [ al / fe ] correlation is detected with a statistical significance in excess of 2@xmath27 in our sample of m71 stars , and extends at least as faint as @xmath3 . * both extremely o poor , na rich stars and extremely o rich , na poor stars such as are observed in m5 and in m13 are not present in our sample of m71 stars .",
    "* li is varying among the subgiants ( as expected ) , and zr may be varying among the subgiants .",
    "m71 appears very similar in its element abundance ratios to m5 , which is not surprising as m5 has a metallicity only slightly lower , [ fe / h ] = @xmath51 dex @xcite .",
    "however , the amplitude of the na / o and al / na relationships appears to be somewhat larger in m5 than in m71 , and still larger in even more metal poor clusters .",
    "our detailed abundance analysis of 25 stars in m71 has revealed abundance variations appearing at such low luminosities that deep mixing scenarios can no longer reproduce these results .",
    "this problem is made even more acute when we add in the data of @xcite and the analysis of @xcite of the ch and cn bands in m71 .",
    "we are forced to the firm conclusion that much , if not all , of the abundance variations seen in m71 must have been in place before the present generation of stars we observe was formed , or ( less likely ) are the result of some type ( binaries ? ) of mass transfer .    in future papers",
    ", we will proceed to apply the techniques and analysis developed here for m71 to other more metal poor globular clusters , where the rgb bump is predicted to be somewhat more luminous and where , judging from the behavior of their bright rgb stars , we may anticipate finding even larger variations at low luminosities among the cluster subgiants and main sequence stars .",
