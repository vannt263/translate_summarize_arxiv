    "we first have to define exactly what we mean by a wormhole  we find that there is a nice _ geometrical _ ( not topological ) characterization of the existence of , and location of , a wormhole `` throat '' .",

    "the analysis of this paper shows that some of these violations of the energy conditions are concentrated in the expected place : on or near the throat of the wormhole . the present analysis , because it is purely local ,",
    "also does not need the many technical assumptions about asymptotic flatness , future and past null infinities , and global hyperbolicity that are needed as ingredients for the topological censorship theorem  @xcite .",
    "the key simplifying assumption in the present analysis is that of taking a static wormhole .",
    "while we believe that a generalization to dynamic wormholes is possible , the situation becomes technically much more complex and and one is rapidly lost in an impenetrable thicket of definitional subtleties and formalism .",
    "in any static spacetime one can decompose the spacetime metric into block diagonal form  @xcite :    @xmath1    _ notation : _ greek indices run from 03 and refer to space - time ; latin indices from the middle of the alphabet ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,  ) run from 13 and refer to space ; latin indices from the beginning of the alphabet ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,  ) will run from 12 and will be used to refer to the wormhole throat and directions parallel to the wormhole throat .",
