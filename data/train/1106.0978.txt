    "relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl has started in 2000 and many interesting data have been obtained .",
    "experiments at large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern has just started .",
    "it is well known fact that nearly perfect fluid picture works to explain large elliptic flow discovered at rhic and lhc . however , there is no detailed understanding on the particle production in high energy hadronic collisions .",
    "especially subsequent non - equilibrium evolution of the system ( glasma ) created in nuclear collisions is not known well . without knowing the detailed glue dynamics in early stages of nucleus collision , correct initial conditions for hydrodynamics would not be obtained .",
    "first important issue is to understand the gluon production in the first moment of collision . in order to study such gluon production in nucleus - nucleus collision",
    ", we shall use the monte - carlo implementation of @xmath1-factorization formulation in which fluctuations of the position of nucleon inside a nucleus is taken into account , and we can study nucleus - nucleus collision event - by - event .",
    "we will use the monte - carlo kln ( mc - kln ) model  @xcite and its extension to running coupling balitsky - kovchegov ( mcrcbk )  @xcite for the computation of gluon production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "both model apply the @xmath1-factorized formula  @xcite in the transverse plane perpendicular to the beam axis locally .",
    "the number distribution of produced gluons is given by @xmath2 with @xmath3 the number of colors .",
    "here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the produced gluons , respectively .",
    "the light - cone momentum fractions of the colliding gluon ladders are then given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the center of mass energy .",
    "a constant gluon multiplication factor @xmath8 is assumed in the mcrcbk model to obtain @xmath4-integrated hadron yields  @xcite .",
    "it does not appear in the corresponding formula for the transverse energy @xmath9 since gluon splitting and hadronization conserves energy .    at each grid point , we compute the thickness function @xmath10 to obtain the local saturation scale and then compute gluon production probability . within a hard disk nucleon approximation , thinkness function",
    "is given by @xmath11 where we assume that the area @xmath12 has the same value as the inelastic proton - proton cross section at the incident energy of @xmath13 gev independent colliding energy .    in mc - kln model ,",
    "saturation momentum is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a free parameter which is expected to have the range of @xmath16 from hera global analysis . in mc - kln",
    ", we assume the gluon distribution function as @xmath17    on the other hand , in mcrcbk , @xmath18 is obtained from the fourier transform of the numerical results of the running coupling bk ( rcbk ) evolution equation  @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is related to the quark dipole scattering amplitude that solves the rcbk equation , @xmath23 as follows : @xmath24 in mc - kln model , @xmath25 dependence is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : qs2 ] ) , but in rcbk , @xmath25 dependence can be obtained from the equation .",
    "therefore , we expect that mcrcbk model has more predictive power than mc - kln model .",
    "in the figure  [ fig : nchnpart ] , the charged particle multiplicities at rhic and lhc as a function of @xmath26 from kln , fkln , and mc - kln model are compared to phobos data .",

    "fkln model  @xcite does not take into account the effects of fluctuations of nucleons inside a nucleus unlike the mc - kln model .",
    "the main difference between kln and fkln model is that fkln model uses the local saturation scale instead of assuming a average nuclear saturation momentum as in kln .",
    "therefore , we see that computations with local saturation momentum improve results .",
    "a comparison between fkln and mc - kln model shows the effects of fluctuations of the position of nucleon inside a nucleus .",
    "one sees such effect in the peripheral collision which suggests that it is important to take into account fluctuation effect in the discussion of the centrality dependence of particle multiplicities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcklnalice ] , the centrality dependence of charged hadron multiplicity in pb+pb collision at @xmath28 tev from alice experiment is compared to the results from fkln and mc - kln . where we use @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qs2 ] ) which controls the @xmath25-evolution speed .",
    "if @xmath15 is small , multiplicity becomes small , and we may think additional particle production mechanism during the evolution of the system , especially before thermalization .",
    "we now compare in fig.[fig : rcbk ] , the centrality dependence of charged hadron with the results obtained from the mcrcbk model in which unintegrated gluon function is taken from the numerical solution of the rcbk equation . the initial condition for the rcbk evolution",
    "is assumed to be mv model : @xmath30\\ , \\label{mv}\\ ] ] with the initial saturation scale @xmath31 gev@xmath32 for nucleon and @xmath33 gev .",
    "for the running coupling , we use @xmath34 with @xmath35 in solving rcbk equation .",
    "rcbk unintegrated gluon function with these parameter set describes the centrality dependence of charged hadron multiplicity for both rhic and lhc which indicates that most of the gluon is produced at the first impact of the nuclear collision . however , we should check parameter dependence carefully . for example , if one changes the parameter @xmath36 in the running coupling , evolution speed changes .    in the bottom up",
    "scenario  @xcite , the number of gluon produced just after the collision will increase by a factor of @xmath37 during the subsequent evolution of the system .",
    "it would be interesting to include such effect into mcrcbk calculations .",
    "so far we assumed that nucleus - nucleus collision is described by the incoherent sum of nucleon - nucleon collisions which will occur when transverse distance squared between two nucleons is smaller than the inelastic proton - proton cross section @xmath38 divided by @xmath39 : @xmath40 this amounts to assume that nucleon is hard sphere ( or disk ) .",
    "however , this approximation may not work in very high energy hadronic collisions .",
    "let us think about the gaussian shape nucleon in order to take into account the effect of extension of nucleon size as incident energy increases .",

    "[ fig : rcbk ] .",
    "model underpredicts the multiplicity at peripheral collisions .",
    "one possible interpretation may be the following : viscosity is large at large impact parameter , entropy production may be larger as impact parameter becomes large .      finally , we plot eccentricity defined by @xmath51 in fig .  [",
    "fig : ecc ] .",
    "since the eccentricity is proportional to the magnitude of elliptic flow , it is important to know the initial value of this quantity .",
    "one sees that the incident energy dependence of the eccentricity is very small according to the results from mcrcbk .     2.76 tev and in au+au collisions at @xmath52 200 gev.,width=326 ]         fig .",
    "[ fig : rcbket ] shows the centrality dependence of the transverse energy at central rapidity for the mv initial condition , and for an initial condition featuring a more rapid fall - off at @xmath53 ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "we note that @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) of the energy of the beams is predicted to be deposited initially into the central rapidity region in central collisions .",
    "longitudinal hydrodynamic expansion ( @xmath56 work ) may reduce the transverse energy by up to a factor of 2 @xcite . in all",
    ", the model based on rcbk evolution of the gluon distribution appears to be consistent with the multiplicity and transverse energy data over a good order of magnitude in both @xmath57 and @xmath7 .",

    "reproduce the centrality dependence of charged hadron multiplicity at rhic and lhc energies which indicate that the entropy production during the thermalization process may be small as well as the small viscosity after thermalization . however , we need detail systematic study of particle production by looking at different observables together with the parameter dependence .    the work of y.n .  was partly supported by grant - in - aid for scientific research no .  20540276 .",
