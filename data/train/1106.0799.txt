    "as observational data on the astrophysical properties of the accretion disks around black holes and other compact objects is accumulated , the study of the accretion mechanism driven by these objects has become an important research topic .",
    "the first and simplest theoretical model of the accretion disks was constructed by imposing strong simplifications on the dynamics and geometrical properties of the disk @xcite . in this so - called steady - state thin accretion disk model",
    "a geometrically thin but optically thick disk was considered in a hydrodynamic approximation by neglecting any magnetic fields in the environment of the black hole and the disk . in their early analysis , novikov and",
    "thorne @xcite modeled accreting matter as a rotating fluid .",
    "this hydrodynamic approximation also holds in the presence of a magnetic field as long as the deviation from geodesics of the photon trajectories is less than the larmor radius ( which in turn is small compared to the schwarzschild radius ) .",
    "however , the discovery of the blandford - znajek mechanism - describing how rotational energy can be extracted from a black hole via magnetic field lines emanating from its event horizon - indicated that magnetic fields can have a considerable effect both on the evolution of the kerr black holes and on the accretion processes feeding the black hole with mass energy @xcite .",
    "later on magnetosphere models were introduced for both static and rotating black holes , which allowed the study of the both the effects of the flux lines connecting the black hole to the accretion disks @xcite , and magnetohydrodynamic flows in geometrically thick disks @xcite .",
    "accretion disk instabilities were also recently discussed in ref .",
    ". the black hole spin evolution due to accretion , in connection with radiation efficiency , when both jets and magnetic fields are present was investigated in ref .",
    "another approach for studying magnetosphere models of schwarzschild black holes with non - magnetized accretion disks consists in solving the grad - shafranov equation , derived from the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "a stationary axisymmetric force - free magnetosphere in a schwarzschild geometry was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model",
    "the black hole is connected by the magnetic field lines to a thin keplerian disk . a uniform magnetic field at the event horizon",
    "was found to be a reasonable assumption in the nonrotating limit .",
    "it also turned out that a uniform radial magnetic field is still an excellent approximation for slowly rotating keplerian disks .    a static and spherically symmetric black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field",
    "was presented by preston and poisson @xcite .",
    "an accretion disk in this geometry will have slightly modified properties compared to the vacuum case , due to the weak magnetic field of this space - time .",
    "this is what we propose to study in this paper .",
    "the preston - poisson metric was derived based on the light - cone gauge introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for perturbed schwarzschild black holes .",
    "this gauge preserves three convenient properties of the eddington - finkelstein coordinates of the schwarzschild metric .",
    "namely ( i ) the advanced - time coordinate @xmath0 is constant on incoming light cones that converge toward the center , ( ii ) the polar and azimuthal angles are constant on the null generators of each light cone , ( iii ) the radial coordinate is an affine - parameter distance along each generator . in the unperturbed scenario there is a fourth property , ( iv ) the radial coordinate @xmath1 is an areal radius or curvature coordinate @xcite , defined by the condition that the area of the 2-spheres with constant @xmath1 is @xmath2 as in flat space .",
    "this fourth property is however not obeyed in a generic perturbed scenario .    as an application of the formalism preston and poisson",
    "have derived the perturbations of the schwarzschild metric arising from the immersion of the black hole into an asymptotically uniform magnetic field . by carefully performing the integration , in top of the modifications induced by the magnetic field , they derive an additional tidal perturbation , due to distant structures . thus the preston - poisson perturbative solution represents a magnetized black - hole space - time in which the tidal gravity is not directly tied to the magnetic field . in this sense",
    "it is a generalization of the exact , two - parameter schwarzschild - melvin metric family , where all perturbations are of magnetic origin @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field generates a quadrupolar deformation of the event horizon . despite the penetration of the magnetic field lines below the horizon",
    "its area stays unchanged .",
    "this is a combined consequence of the hawking - hartle formula @xcite , according to which the change of the area during the quasi - static perturbation is determined by the flux of energy @xmath3 crossing the horizon ; and of the particular form of @xmath3 for this specific black hole , which vanishes on the horizon ( at least to @xmath4 order , where @xmath5 is the strength of the magnetic field ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite konoplya has rewritten the preston - poisson metric into a diagonal form by a suitable redefinition of the radial variable and a replacement of the null coordinate by a temporal variable . for the latter",
    "a tortoise - type transformation was employed .",
    "then he has analyzed the motion of particles around such black holes .",
    "he has studied equatorial orbits and found that the tidal perturbations from surrounding sources have significant influence on the motion of test particles . the time delay and the bending angle characterizing massless particles together with the binding energy of massive particles",
    "have increased , while the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit is decreased due to the presence of tidal forces .",
    "our aim here is to study the accretion processes onto preston - poisson black holes , which incorporate both magnetic and tidal perturbations of the schwarzschild black hole . in section 2 we present a short summary of the accretion process in the absence of the magnetic fields .    in section 3",
    "we briefly review the preston - poisson metric both in its original light - cone gauge form , and in the coordinates presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , employing also the analysis of the curvature invariants from appendix [ curvature ] .",
    "we establish the radial range over which this geometry describes a perturbed schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we analyze the geodesic motion in the equatorial plane in terms of an effective potential in section 4 .    here",
    "we also present the numerical study of the modifications induced by the magnetic field and tidal perturbations in the disk radiation , temperature profile , spectrum , luminosity and energy conversion efficiency for the preston - poisson black hole . for this",
    "we employ the explicit form of the energy - momentum tensor given in appendix [ tab ] .",
    "finally , section 5 contains the concluding remarks .",
    "in the steady state accretion disk model physical quantities describing matter fields are averaged over the characteristic time scale @xmath6 , total azimuthal angle @xmath7 and accretion disk height @xmath8 ( defined by its maximum half thickness ) .",
    "the matter in the accretion disk is modeled by an anisotropic fluid , where the density @xmath9 of the rest mass ( the specific heat is neglected ) , the energy flow vector @xmath10 and stress tensor @xmath11 are defined in the averaged rest - frame of the orbiting plasma with 4-velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the invariant algebraic decomposition of the stress - energy tensor is @xmath13where @xmath14 .    in this hydrodynamic approximation page and thorne @xcite",
    "have derived the law of rest mass conservation , stating that the time averaged rate of rest mass accretion is independent of the radius : @xmath15 .",
    "( here @xmath16 and @xmath1 are the time and radial coordinates and @xmath17 is the averaged surface density ) .",
    "the integral form of the conservation laws of angular momentum and energy was also derived by averaging the continuity equation and the total divergence of the density - flux 4-vectors @xmath18 ( angular momentum density - flux ) and @xmath19 ( energy density - flux ) , respectively .",
    "here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the killing vectors of the axially symmetric geometry and @xmath22 is the azimuthal coordinate .    from the integral form of the conservation laws of energy and angular - momentum and the energy - angular momentum relation @xmath23 , page and thorne",
    "have expressed the time - averaged vertical component @xmath24 ( the photon flux ) of the energy flow vector @xmath10 as @xmath25here @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the specific energy , specific angular - momentum and angular velocity of the orbiting plasma particles with respect to the coordinate time @xmath16 . the above formula is valid under the assumption that the torque of the infalling matter on the disk vanishes at the inner edge of the disk ( since the accreting matter reaching the marginally stable orbit @xmath29 falls freely into the hole and can not exert any considerable torque ) .",
    "supposing that the electron - scattering opacity is negligible and the accretion disk is _ optically _ thick , the disk surface radiates a black body spectrum .",
    "then the surface temperature @xmath30 of the disk is given by @xmath31 , with the stefan - boltzmann constant @xmath32 .",
    "the disk luminosity @xmath33 is calculated as function of @xmath34 ( which is in turn expressed in terms of the thermal photon flux ) as @xmath35where @xmath36 is the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath37 .",
    "another important characteristics of the mass accretion process is the efficiency with which the central object converts rest mass into outgoing radiation .",
    "the efficiency is defined as the ratio of two rates evaluated at infinity : the rate of the radiated energy of photons escaping from the disk surface to infinity over the rate at which mass - energy is transported to the black hole @xcite .",
    "if all emitted photons escape to infinity , the efficiency is given in terms of the specific energy measured at the marginally stable orbit @xmath29 as @xmath38    for schwarzschild black holes the efficiency @xmath39 is about @xmath40 , irrespective of whether photon capture by the black hole is taken into account or not .",
    "however , for rapidly rotating black holes , the efficiency @xmath41 is found to be @xmath42 , decreasing slightly to @xmath43 with photon capture by the black hole included @xcite .",
    "in this section we review the preston - poisson metric , both in the original light - cone gauge coordinates employed in @xcite and in the coordinates introduced in ref .",
    "the latter is essential in studying the accretion processes in the remaining part of the paper .",
    "then we analyze the equatorial geometry and we establish the radial range where the interpretation of a perturbed schwarzschild black hole holds .",
    "the preston - poisson metric represents a perturbed schwarzschild black hole with perturbations caused by ( i ) an asymptotically uniform magnetic field @xmath5 and ( ii ) independent tidal effects , described by a parameter @xmath44 .",
