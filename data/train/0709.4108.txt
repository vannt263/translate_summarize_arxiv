    "metal - insulator transitions ( mit ) and related properties in correlated electron systems have been the central topics in condensed matter physics for several decades @xcite .",
    "the mit can be easily realized by the variation of the external fields , doping concentration , pressure and temperature in many typical transition - metal oxides .",
    "the simplest and effective model to describe the low - energy physics of these strongly correlated transition - metal oxides is the single - orbital hubbard model , including the competition between the kinetic energy and the local coulomb interaction .",
    "such a competition may result in many complicated and novel phenomena , such as the high temperature superconductivity in low - dimensional cuprates .",
    "theoretically , great progress has been achieved in understanding the essence of the mit in the single - orbital hubbard model , mainly due to the development of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite in the past decade .",
    "the dmft allows us to accurately treat the hubbard subbands in time axis and to obtain the quasiparticle peaks with the three - peak structure , which makes this approach an advance over the density functional theory and the hatree - fock approximation @xcite . with the help of dmft",
    ", we have gotten a deep insight to many properties of the single - orbital hubbard model , e.g. the mit , the optical conductivity and absorption , transport , and so on@xcite . among these properties related to the mit",
    ", the order of the mit in the hubbard model is essential .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that in the single - orbital hubbard model on bethe lattice , the mit is first - order for 0 @xmath2 t @xmath2 t@xmath0 ; whilst , it is second - order for t @xmath1 t@xmath0 . in the two - dimensional hubbard model , onoda and",
    "imada @xcite also found that the mit is first - order in finite t @xmath2 t@xmath3 by means of the correlator projection approach with the dmft .",
    "these suggest that in low t , the mit in the single - orbital hubbard model is first - order .",
    "since the realistic transition - metal oxides , such as manganites , vanadates , titanates and nickelates , usually have multiple degenerate orbitals @xcite , the multi - orbital hubbard model is more appropriate to describe the low - energy process than the singe - orbital hubbard model . at the same time",
    ", the multi - orbital hubbard model may exhibit more complicated and richer phenomena than the single - orbital hubbard model . besides the conventional localization - delocalization transition of electrons",
    ", there may exist many different orbital ordered phases .",
    "for example , in a two - orbital system , one orbital may be completely empty and another is fulfilled , forming the ferro / antiferro - orbital ordered phase ; or , one orbital is fulfilled and insulating , another is partially occupied and metallic , forming the so - called orbital selective mott phase ( osmp ) @xcite . in these situations , the orbital degree of freedom plays an important role in the phase diagram and the groundstate properties .",
    "more recently , a number of researches have been concentrated on the nature of mit and other properties of the two - orbital hubbard models @xcite . however , even on the bethe or the hyper - cubic lattices , the nature of the mit in the two - orbital hubbard models has been controversial , although intensive theoretical efforts have already been done @xcite . in the two - orbital systems ,",
    "inaba _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and bnemann _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found that the mott transition is discontinuous for any finite @xmath4 and continuous only for @xmath5 within a generalized gutzwiller approximation .",
    "however , utilizing the dmft with the numerical renormalization group , pruschke and bulla @xcite claimed that the mott transition is second - order for j @xmath1 @xmath6 .",
    "they found that the variation of the local squared moment of spin near the transition is too small to judge the order of mit for large j. by making use of the dmft with self - energy functional approach , inaba and koga @xcite believed that the nature of the mott transition is first - order in all the parameter region for finite j , though they found that the jump of quasiparticle weight is too weak to identify the order of the phase transition when j is large enough .",
    "the controversy on the order of the mit suggests that it is urgent to find a more proper quantity to judge the occurrence and the order of the mit when j is very large .",
    "up to date , most of the studies have been focused on the bethe or the hyper - cubic lattices .",
    "it is not known what the essence of the mit is in the multi - orbital hubbard model on the frustrated lattices .",
    "when the strong electron - electron interactions compete with the geometrical frustration effects , a number of unconventional phases and exotic properties emerge as the result of the competition , such as the mit and the antiferromagnetism in the organic compounds @xmath7-(bedt - ttf)@xmath8x with x as an anion @xcite , etc .",
    "recent development in material fabrication shows that more and more transition - metal oxides exhibit strong electronic correlation on two - dimensional triangular lattices and the multiple orbital character , such as nanio@xmath8@xcite and agnio@xmath8@xcite , etc .",
    "these appeal for the study on the multi - orbital hubbard model on the triangular lattice .",
    "in this paper we focus on the mit physics of the two - orbital hubbard model on a triangular lattice by means of the exact - diagonalization dmft .",
    "we adopt the local squared moment of charge , together with the local squared moments of spin and orbital , to measure the occurrence of mit in the two - orbital hubbard model , and find that we can well judge the occurrence of the mit when the hund s coupling j is very large .",
    "we definitely show that the mit at large j is first - order .",
    "the variation of the optical conductivity of the two - orbital hubbard model is also consistent with the mit with the increase of u. the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we describe the model hamiltonian of the two - orbital system and briefly explain the framework of the exact - diagonalization dmft approach ; in sec.iii , we present the evolutions of the densities of states ( dos ) , the local squared moments of charge , spin and orbital , and the optical conductivity with the on - site coulomb interaction ; the order of the mit in the two - orbital system is also discussed in sec.iii ; the last part is devoted to the summary .",
    "we start from a half - filled two - orbital hubbard model @xmath9 in a triangular lattice , where @xmath10 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the electron at site @xmath11 with orbital @xmath12 and spin @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the electron number operator .",

    "the hamiltonian ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are mapped onto an effective anderson impurity model by integrating over all the spatial degrees of freedom , except for the central site @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian , @xmath29 , contains a central `` atomic '' or `` impurity '' part , @xmath30 , and an effective medium part @xmath31 , which has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "the two - orbital anderson impurity hamiltonian reads @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 create the `` impurity '' electron and a bath electron , respectively ; the impurity level @xmath36 is usually chosen as the zero point of energy , and the hybridization parameter @xmath37 of the impurity model is calculated self - consistently in dmft .",
    "the atomic hamiltonian @xmath30 of the central site is the same as @xmath38 in eq.(2 ) , and @xmath39 represents the number of the conduction band of anderson impurity model . for a set of parameters ( @xmath20 and @xmath22 ) , we can obtain the interacting green function @xmath40 , the free green function @xmath41 and the self - energy of the anderson model as follows , @xmath42_{\\alpha \\beta},\\ ] ] and the lattice green s function is @xmath43_{\\alpha \\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the impurity green function @xmath44 is given by @xmath45_{\\alpha \\beta }    \\ : .",

    "we perform the iterative procedure repeatedly until a self - consistent solution of the lattice green s function and the self - energy are found .",
    "various analytical and numerical methods can be employed to solve the effective impurity problem . in the following ,",
    "we first make use of the exact - diagonalization ( ed ) method to treat the impurity model eq.(4 ) and ( 5 ) at finite temperatures of @xmath16 @xcite",
    ". then we perform the iteration on eqs .",
    "( 6 - 9 ) repeatedly until a self - consistent solution .",
    "some subroutines , such as the minimizing subroutine which searches for the parameters of the anderson impurity hamiltonian and the rs subroutine which is used to diagonalize the anderson impurity hamiltonian , are from the ref.[2 ] . in this paper",
    "we take @xmath50 for each spin channel .",
    "liebsch found that when @xmath39 @xmath1 3 , the converged results qualitatively agree with each other @xcite , and the accuracy of the ed ansatz in the single - orbital hubbard model is well controlled .",
    "demchenko @xmath51 @xmath52 had shown that in the absence of particle - hole symmetry , the pole formation and the mit are independent of each other on the bethe lattice@xcite .",
    "so , the quasiparticle weight z is not suitable for characterizing the occurrence of the mit . in this paper",
    ", we utilize the local squared moments of charge , spin and orbital and the corresponding local susceptibility to characterize the nature of the mott transition .",
    "since the mit is associated with the localization - delocalization transition of the charge degree of freedom , we measure the mit with the local squared moments of charge , @xmath53 , @xmath54 together with the local squared moments of spin and orbital , @xmath55 @xmath56 all of these quantities are relevant to the spin - dependent double occupancy @xmath57 and the orbital - dependent double occupancy @xmath58 : @xmath59 through a few identities , such as , @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the free energy , and @xmath47 the chemical potential",

    "as reported in the literature , the hund s coupling plays an important role in controlling the mott transition , and the nature of the mott transition in the two - orbital system on the symmetric bethe lattice has been controversial @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we investigate the properties of the mott transition on the asymmetric triangular lattice so as to resolve the controversial results .",
    "-0.6 cm [ 1.15 ]    remarkably different from the bethe lattice , the density of states ( dos ) of quasiparticles on the triangular lattice is asymmetric , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where we also present the evolution of the dos with the increase of the intra - orbital coulomb interaction . for @xmath73 , it is clearly seen that the mott transition has already occurred at @xmath74 .",
    "a detailed numerical calculation shows that the critical value of the mit is u@xmath0=6.12 .",
    "for other finite @xmath22 , the dependence of dos on the coulomb interaction strength @xmath20 exhibits similar tendency . with the increase of the hund",
    "s coupling @xmath22 , the critical points of the mott transition occur at 18.2 , 16.8 , 6.12 and 5.85 for @xmath22=0.0 , 0.01u , @xmath20/4 , and @xmath20/3 , respectively .",
    "the tendency of @xmath75 substantially decreasing with the increase of the hund s coupling on the present 2-dimensional triangular lattice is consistent with the previous results on the bethe lattice .",
    "it is very interesting that for various @xmath22 , the critical value , @xmath76 , of the mit on the triangular lattice is about twice larger than that on the bethe lattice .",
    "this may arise from two facts : one is from the spin frustration and fluctuation effect on the triangular lattice ; another is from that the orbital fluctuations in the two - orbital system enhance the metallic character , leading to a large critical value , u@xmath0 .",
    "-0.6 cm [ 1.15 ]    the optical conductivity also exhibits signatures of the mit .",
    "it is interesting that how the optical conductivity evolves with the coulomb interactions in the two - orbital hubbard model on the triangular lattice .",
    "compared with that of the single - orbital hubbard model , the optical conductivity of the two - band hubbard model is more complicated and exhibits multi - peak structure , as seen in fig .",
    "2 . when the coulomb interaction @xmath20 is smaller than the critical value @xmath76 , the drude peak and the charge excitation peaks exist at the same time .",
    "the multi - peak charge excitation structure in the present system significantly differs from the single - peak structure of the single - orbital hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the peaks at @xmath77 and @xmath78 come from the excitation between different hubbard subbands below and above the fermi surface . with the increasing of the coulomb interaction , the intervals of these hubbard",
    "subbands become larger and larger , and the charge - excitation peaks move to the high frequency , as seen in fig .",
    "2 . since the bandwidths of the two orbitals are identical , no orbital selective mott transition is observed .",
    "as @xmath793 , we observe a small low - energy mid - peak at @xmath80 .",
    "such a mid - peak may contribute from the quasiparticle peaks near the fermi level , as seen in the dos near e@xmath81 in fig .",
    "the excitation between the renormalized quasiparticle peaks and the hubband subbands close to e@xmath81 gives rise to this small mid - peak . when the coulomb interaction @xmath20 is greater than the critical interaction @xmath76 , the drude peak and the small mid - peak disappear .",
    "subsequently , the system enters an insulating phase , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the insulating gap becomes more and more wide with the increase of the coulomb interaction .",
    "up to date , the optical conductivity experiment on the compounds with two orbitals and triangular lattice is not available , we anticipate the corresponding experimental results can be done in near future .",
    "-0.6 cm [ 1.15 ]    as known from the earlier literature , the hund s coupling j plays a key role in controlling the nature of the mott transition in the two - orbital hubbard model on the bethe and the hyper - cubic lattices . on the present triangular lattice ,",
    "we investigate the local squared moment of charge and the double occupations @xmath57 ( the dashed lines ) and @xmath58 ( the dot - dashed lines ) on the intra - orbital coulomb interaction at different hund s coupling @xmath22 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . at @xmath82 , as seen in fig . 3a and fig .",
    "3b , there is no singular jump in @xmath53 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 in this triangular frustrated system , which implies that the mott transition in the two - orbital system with equal bandwidths is the second order .",
    "on the other hand , when the hund s coupling j is introduced , there are discontinuous jumps in @xmath53 and the double occupancies , as shown in fig .",
    "3a and fig .",
    "3b , showing that the mott transition in the two - orbital hubbard model is first - order .",
    "this result is consistent with what obtained via the gutzwiller method @xcite on the infinite - dimensional hyper - cubic lattice . on the bethe lattice ,",
    "the jump of @xmath83 is obscure and hard to distinguish whether the mit is first- or second - order @xcite . while on the present triangular lattice , the jumps of the local squared moments of charge @xmath53 is very obvious for all @xmath84",
    ". therefore the mit in the half - filled two - orbital hubbard model on triangular lattice is first - order for all finite j situations",
    ". these results also agree with those of inaba @xmath51 @xmath52 by the dmft with self - energy functional approach @xcite .",
    "however , at @xmath73 , our result is contrast to that of pruschke @xmath51 @xmath52 which is obtained by the dmft with the numerical renormalization group @xcite .",
    "this shows that @xmath53 is a proper measure to the mit in the large j situation .    to understand the nature of the mott transition more clearly",
    ", we also calculate the local orbital and spin squared moments of @xmath85 and @xmath83 , as shown in fig .",
    "-0.6 cm [ 1.15 ]    in the metallic limit of u=0 , the local squared moments @xmath86 ; and in the insulating and strongly correlated regime , @xmath87 for @xmath5 , and @xmath85=0 and @xmath88 for all finite @xmath22 , which are in agreement with the linearized dmft results @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "4 , the local squared moments of spin and orbital are continuous at j=0 , showing that the mit is the second order , in agreement with the result from the local square moment of charge .",
    "further , as seen in fig .",
    "4 , for various finite j with j=0.01u , u@xmath894 , and u@xmath893 , the discontinuous jumps of the local squared moments of orbital and spin also demonstrate that the mit is first - order , consistent with the preceding results . therefore ,",
    "combining the local squared moment of charge , @xmath53 , and those of spin and orbital , @xmath83 and @xmath85 , one can measure the order of the mit over all of the hund s coupling j.    -0.6 cm [ 1.15 ]    consistent with the behaviors of the local squared moments , the divergence of the local orbital susceptibility near @xmath75 in fig . 5 , together with the discontinuous jump of the local charge susceptibility in the inset in fig .",
    "5 , clearly shows that the mit on the triangular lattice is the second order at @xmath5 . since the mit in the present system with finite j is the first order , the local orbital and charge susceptibilities also exhibit discontinuities .",
    "it is worthy of noticing that due to the frustration effect on the present triangular lattice , the local orbital susceptibility in the system with @xmath90 is suppressed near the mit critical point ; meanwhile , such suppression is observed only for @xmath91 on the bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "similar behavior is also observed in the local squared moment of orbital .",
    "compared with the single - orbital hubbard model on the triangular lattice , the critical value @xmath75 of the two orbital model much larger than that in the single - orbital model@xcite is mainly due to the orbital fluctuations .",
    "the physical origin of the different order in the mit systems with finite j and j=0 is still a puzzle .",
    "bnemann et al .",
    "attributed it to the presence of multiple atomic energy scales in the two - orbital hubbard model .",
    "this argument may be not true since there does exist more than one atomic energy scale except u in the single - orbital hubbard model . to resolve this puzzle , we suggest that the order of mit in the strongly correlated hubbard model may depend on the symmetry of the systems . at j=0 ,",
    "the spin - orbital coupling system is su(4 ) symmetric ; on the other hand , the rotational symmetry of the orbital space is usually broken for finite j. even if the rotational symmetry of the orbitals exists , i.e. @xmath92 and the inter - orbital hund s coupling @xmath93 , the symmetry of the system is su(2)@xmath94su(2 ) .",
    "however , we find that the phase transition in such a system is still the first order , as seen in the green curve ( dot - dashed line ) in fig .",
    "we also notice that in the two - orbital hubbard model with the same bandwidths , the osmt is excluded .",
    "it is interesting to ask what the order of the osmt is in the two - orbital triangular hubbard models with different bandwidths , which deserves further study .",
    "one notes that in the two - dimensional triangular spin systems , the geometric frustration is considerable in the strong correlation regime , so the spatial correlations and fluctuations of spins may be important .",
    "in this situation , the approximation and precision of the present single - site dmft approach should be carefully justified .",
    "fortunately , when we constrain the discussion in the paramagnetic phases , the precision of such an approximation is well controlled .",
    "this has been demonstrated for the single - orbital hubbard model in the triangular lattice by several authors @xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite and merino _",
    "et al._@xcite have shown that the results of the single - orbital hubbard model obtained by the single - site dmft approach are consistent with those by other methods .",
    "and the transport properties of the 2-dimensional triangular hubbard model within the single - site dmft agrees with the experimental results of the organic compound@xcite . on the contrary",
    ", such a method is failed when it is applied for the two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "this arises from the fact that in the 2-dimensional triangular lattice , the spatial antiferromagnetic correlation is greatly suppressed by the geometric frustration , as pointed out by aryanpour _",
    "et al._@xcite and merino _ et al._@xcite .",
    "another reason is that the coordinate number of the triangular lattice is considerably larger than that of the square lattice .",
    "on the other hand , it is highly desirable to extend the present single - site dmft approach to the cluster or cellular dmft approach so as to well incorporate the spatial fluctuation and the intersite correlation , as developed by many authors for the single - orbital models in recent years@xcite .",
    "however , such an extension to the multi - orbital model meets difficulty since it goes beyond the ability of the high - performance computing resources available .",
    "and we anticipate that the cluster extension will not qualitatively alternate our conclusions .",
    "by using the exact - diagonalization dmft approach , we have demonstrated that the hund s coupling j leads to a first - order metal - insulator transition in the two - orbital hubbard model with the degenerate bandwidths in the triangular lattice .",
    "the discontinuities of the local squared moments of the charge , spin and orbital show that the first - order metal - insulator transition occurs not only in the small j region , but also in the large j region .",
    "such distinct behaviors of the systems with finite j and j=0 are attributed to the lowering of the symmetry of the systems .",
    "the multi - peak structure in the optical conductivity of the two - orbital hubbard model arises from the charge excitation among more than two hubbard subbands .",
    "this work was supported by the nsfc of china no.90303013 , the bairen project and the knowledge innovation program of chinese academy of sciences .",
    "part of the calculations were performed in center for computational science of caships and the shanghai supercomputer center ."
