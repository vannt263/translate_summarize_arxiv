    "the possibility of @xmath0-nuclear quasi - bound states was first discussed by haider and liu @xcite and li et al .",
    "@xcite , when it was realised that the @xmath0-nucleon interaction is attractive .",
    "nevertheless , the early ( @xmath1,p ) experiment looking for these effects was not conclusive @xcite .",
    "one possible reason for the difficulty in the interpretation of those experimental results is that these states are very broad .",
    "this point of view has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the widths of @xmath0 nuclear states were attributed largely to the two nucleon capture mode .",
    "another possibility , pursued in this letter , is that these states are bound much more strongly than was generally expected .",
    "if the quasi - bound states exist , then one may expect them to be narrow , in few - nucleon systems , and thus be easier to detect there .",
    "an indirect verification was suggested by wilkin @xcite , who interpreted a rapid slope of the @xmath2he low energy amplitude as a signal of a quasibound state .",
    "more recently in a simpler two nucleon case , very strong three - body @xmath3 correlations were found in measurements of the @xmath4 cross section in the threshold region @xcite .",
    "today , it is possible to revive the question of @xmath0 nuclear states on a firm experimental background .",
    "first , definite progress has been achieved in the understanding of low energy @xmath0-n interactions .",
    "this allows us to calculate the dominant single - nucleon optical potential for an @xmath0 in nuclear matter .",
    "second , the measurement of @xmath0 production in the nucleon collisions allows us to calculate the absorptive part of the two - nucleon contribution to this optical potential .",
    "one particular result of the recent studies is the scattering length @xmath5 in the @xmath0-n system , which is expected to be much larger than was previously estimated .",
    "a recent value of @xmath6 has been obtained in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "also , several other recent models listed in ref.@xcite produce @xmath7 much larger than the @xmath8 expected , when the first calculations of @xmath0 nuclear binding were performed .",
    "these models combine interactions in the coupled @xmath0-n , @xmath1-n , @xmath9-n , @xmath10-n channels and use the scattering data to fix the properties of the @xmath0-n scattering amplitude in the threshold region .",
    "in particular a scattering amplitude as large as @xmath11 would generate an @xmath0-nucleus potential as deep as @xmath12 mev and a very rich @xmath0-nuclear spectroscopy .",
    "such an estimate is not realistic , however , and it will be shown below that off - shell and nuclear effects reduce this well depth to about @xmath13 mev .",
    "even so , it is strong enough to bind s , p , d , f states in heavy nuclei .",
    "in addition an absorptive amplitude of @xmath14 would generate an absorptive potential @xmath15 as strong as @xmath16 mev in the nuclear center and the widths of s states as large as 50 mev .",
    "such short lived states would certainly be very difficult to detect .",
    "again , the off - shell and nuclear effects reduce this absorptive potential strength to about @xmath17 mev .    in addition , experimental cross - sections for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 reactions determine that part of the absorptive potential which describes the inverse @xmath20 reaction rate in nuclei .",
    "these reactions are essential to fix an uncertainty that has earlier existed in the estimates of the @xmath0 lifetime in a nucleus .",
    "the two - nucleon capture processes are found to generate a rather weak absorptive potential @xmath21 of @xmath22 mev strength at nuclear matter densities .",
    "furthermore , this mode of @xmath23 absorption is found to be dominated by the spin triplet nn pairs .",
    "altogether , the optical potential calculated here supports rather a rich nuclear spectroscopy for the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "in particular , many @xmath24 mev broad s - wave states are expected as well as some less broad p , d and f states which may be generated in medium and heavy nuclei .",
    "this paper contains three main sections . in section",
    "ii the @xmath25 absorption mechanisms are discussed and the two nucleon absorption rate is calculated .",
    "section iii is devoted to calculations of the effective @xmath26 amplitude in the nuclear medium .",
    "this is done with a @xmath27-matrix approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . finally in section iv , some nuclear levels of the @xmath25 mesons are given .",
    "the @xmath0 meson lifetime in a nucleus is determined by three basic reactions @xmath28",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30    where the superfix denotes the spin of nn pairs . the first process is rather well known .",
    "it is described in more detail in the next section as it turns out to be the dominant one .",
    "the other two reactions ( [ d2 ] ) and ( [ d3 ] ) correspond to @xmath0 absorption on two correlated nn pairs in either the spin singlet or spin triplet states .",
    "the rates for these two - nucleon @xmath0 capture modes have been uncertain for some time and two extreme views were expressed . in the first papers @xcite,@xcite",
    "these reactions were discarded altogether . on the other hand , a model calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite indicated large or even dominant effects from the latter two processes . now",
    "a purely phenomenological evaluation is possible as the cross sections for @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 have been measured in the close to threshold region @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the first reaction ( [ r2 ] ) may be used to calculate the rate of the process ( [ d2 ] ) , where the protons are correlated in a spin singlet state . the second reaction ( [ r3d ] ) gives the rate of @xmath0 absorption on a spin triplet nn pair .",
    "general , but approximate , relationships between scattering cross sections and the nuclear decay rates are given by the following formulas for the absorptive optical potentials : @xmath34\\ ] ] @xmath35   \\frac{l_1(nn)}{l_2(nn \\eta))}\\ ] ] @xmath36 \\frac{l_1(nn)}{l_1(d\\eta)\\psi_d(0)^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 are the total cross sections at low energies , @xmath38 is the relative velocity in the nn system required to produce slow a @xmath25 , @xmath39 is the @xmath40 relative velocity , @xmath41 are the phase space elements defined by @xmath42 \\ , , \\\\",
    "l_2(nn\\eta)&=&\\int\\frac{d\\bar{p}d\\bar{q}}{(2\\pi)^6 } \\delta[e - e_{nn}(p)-e_{\\eta}(q ) ]   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 is the deuteron wave function at the origin .",
    "these relationships essentially reflect the detailed balance property of the direct and inverse processes . one correction involving the deuteron final state",
    "is introduced into the relation ( [ w2d ] ) with the following motivation .",
    "the meson formation reactions require high @xmath44 momentum transfer between the two nucleons .",
    "therefore , by the uncertainty principle one expects short distances to be involved and the deuteron to be formed in a coalescent way .",
    "hence it is the deuteron wave function @xmath43 that arises in eq.([w2d ] ) .",
    "the experimental cross section @xmath45 measured in ref.@xcite at the excess energy @xmath46 mev and eq.([w2d ] ) generate an absorptive potential of @xmath47 mev strength at the nuclear center . on the other hand , the @xmath48 measured at @xmath49 mev @xcite yields @xmath50 , according to eq.([w2 ] ) .",
    "the statistical average @xmath51 obtained in this way is small [ @xmath52 mev ] and is of less importance than the dominant @xmath53 mev .",
    "corrections to relation ( [ w2 ] ) are necessary , since it is based on the detailed balance assumption which has clear limitations in the nuclear medium situation .",
    "these corrections are discussed rather schematically as the main effect comes from the deuteron relation ( [ w2d ] ) .",
    "close to the meson production threshold the inverse reactions @xmath54 rates are strongly enhanced by final state interactions between the two nucleons .",
    "these interactions reflect the proximity of the deuteron or the spin singlet virtual state .",
    "such long ranged structures are not formed in the initial states of @xmath55 reactions inside nuclei .",
    "thus , a correction should be introduced into eq.([w2 ] ) .",
    "it may be expressed in terms of a final state wave function @xmath56 in the same way as it was done in eq.([w2d ] ) for the deuteron .",
    "the usefulness of such a parallel between the bound and scattering states was demonstrated in ref.@xcite .",
    "roughly , the enhancement due to final state interactions is due to large values of @xmath57 at short ranges as compared to the values of the incident wave  a @xmath58 spherical bessel function . in order to average over the interaction range a simple potential",
    "is used to describe reaction ( [ r2 ] ) . the wave function and an integral of a transition matrix element over the three - body phase space",
    "are calculated in a way described in ref .",
    "it follows that an enhancement of the reaction rate due to final state @xmath59 interactions amounts to a factor of 5 at @xmath60 mev .",
    "the same factor reduces the spin singlet absorptive potential to an almost negligible value of @xmath61 mev .",
    "the total nuclear matter average is now @xmath62 mev , and it is this number that is used for further calculations in this paper .",
    "a consistency check for this procedure is provided by reaction ( [ r3 ] ) , which has been studied recently on a deuteron target @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "the cross section @xmath63 found at @xmath46 mev is now used .",
    "this particular value of @xmath64 is chosen to guarantee the final @xmath65-wave dominance and to reduce the @xmath66 final state interactions at the same time .",
    "reaction ( [ r3 ] ) involves two @xmath67 spin states . under the assumption of statistical proportion for these states , eq.([w2 ] ) generates @xmath68 mev .",
    "the effect of @xmath69 final state interactions reduces this estimate by a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "the final @xmath71 compares favourably with the corresponding value obtained from the deuteron .",
    "in this section , a scattering amplitude for the @xmath0-n system immersed in nuclear matter is studied .",
    "this amplitude is based on a phenomenological @xmath27-matrix model of ref.@xcite . in the next stage , it is used to calculate the optical potential for @xmath0 mesons .",
    "low energy @xmath0-n interactions are dominated by two factors : the @xmath72 resonance and the cusp at the @xmath0-n threshold .",
    "the cusp is seen directly in the @xmath1-n channel but it has to be calculated in the @xmath0-n channel .",
    "this scenario is plotted in fig.1 , which shows the elastic @xmath0-n scattering amplitude .",
    "the strength of the cusp reflects the value of the scattering length . on the other hand ,",
    "as the nucleons are bound it is the region just below the cusp that determines the nuclear optical potential for @xmath0 mesons . to calculate it we use a model that contains four basic channels : @xmath0-n , @xmath1-n , @xmath9-n and @xmath73-n . to simplify the argument it is briefly presented in a single @xmath0-n channel case . for numerical calculations this limitation is relaxed , however .      to account for the @xmath72 resonance the k matrix",
    "is parametrized as    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the position of the cdd pole related to the resonance and @xmath76 is its coupling to the @xmath0-n channel .",
    "the first term @xmath77 describes some potential interactions within the channel .",
    "the complete model discussed in ref.@xcite contains in general nine phenomenological parameters , those related to the @xmath0-n channel are @xmath78 , @xmath79 mev and @xmath80 .",
    "now , the t matrix is obtained from heitler s equation @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the relative @xmath0-n momentum .",
    "a nuclear optical potential for @xmath0 may be given in terms of this scattering matrix , if the energy dependence in @xmath83 is accounted for , and an average over nucleon states is taken .",
    "to do this a simple fermi gas is used with a nucleon fermi level at @xmath84 mev and nucleon energies given by @xmath85 .",
    "the meson energy @xmath86 is put equal to zero , and this simulates the conditions in large nuclei when the @xmath0 binding energy is close to the bottom of the mesonic optical potential well .",
    "the scattering amplitude averaged over the nucleon levels defines an effective scattering length which is denoted by @xmath87 . the numerical value @xmath88 is obtained and should be compared to the free scattering length @xmath6 .",
    "the difference between these two quantities reflects the slope of the cusp as well as a rapid fall of the absorptive amplitude in the subthreshold region .",
    "the optical potential is given by @xmath89 in the standard way @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the nuclear density , @xmath92 is the @xmath0-n reduced mass and the index @xmath93 on @xmath94 indicates the single nucleon origin of this potential .",
    "the absorptive part of @xmath95 given above coincides in the scattering region with the @xmath96 of ( [ w1 ] ) . with",
    "@xmath87 obtained above from the free scattering amplitudes the optical potential becomes @xmath97 mev .",
    "the depth of this well turns out to be much deeper than the pioneering estimates of about @xmath98 mev obtained in refs.@xcite , @xcite but the absorptive part is similar .    for the nuclear physics of @xmath0 mesons , the energies in the @xmath0-nucleon system range from about 50 mev below the threshold to 20 mev above it .",
    "this region is dominated by the @xmath72 , which is supposed to be determined by some short range ( quark ) interactions .",
    "this inner state is coupled to the channel states which change its properties . in the nuclear medium situation",
    "one needs to distinguish these internal and channel states as they are differently affected by the nuclear medium .",
    "this question is studied in the next section .",
    "the assumption behind the singularity in our @xmath99 matrix is that the @xmath72 is built upon an internal state @xmath100 ( say a quark state ) which is additional to the channel states . in this sense",
    "it has to appear in any propagators in the intermediate states of interest .",
    "the energy of this internal state @xmath75 contains a contribution @xmath101 due to its coupling to the channel states .",
    "this contribution ( or energy shift ) may be presented as    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the coupling constant from eq.([k2 ] ) , @xmath104 is a formfactor for the @xmath105 vertex and @xmath106 is an on - shell momentum .",
    "while the coupling constant is known in this model the formfactor is not .",
    "it has to be very short ranged , in order to describe the physics involved and also to be consistent with eq.([k2 ] ) , where @xmath75 is kept constant .",
    "it turns out that , for the nuclear physics of interest , the value of @xmath101 is irrelevant .",
    "what is relevant is the change @xmath107 due to the nuclear medium , and this involves only the low @xmath82 region in the integral of eq.([shi ] ) .",
    "the nuclear shift of the @xmath72 is thus practically independent of the formfactor .",
    "thus , the main effect of the nuclear medium becomes the pauli blocking effect which should be introduced into eq.([shi ] ) .",
    "it pushes the energy of @xmath72 upwards .",
    "typical shifts @xmath107 for the nuclear matter fermi momentum @xmath108 are @xmath109 mev for a nucleon at the bottom of the well and @xmath110 mev for a nucleon at the fermi level . in these calculations",
    "the @xmath0 meson has been put to rest on the bottom of its potential well and the intermediate state meson excitation energies are described by free kinetic energies . since the energy release in the pionic decay channels is large , the corresponding nuclear effects due to @xmath111 and @xmath112 states are insignificant . in principle , the nuclear effects enter also into the term @xmath113 of eq.([k2 ] ) . however , this term is very small in this model and these corrections are negligible .",
    "readers interested in the details of such calculations are referred to ref .",
    "@xcite , where similar shifts are discussed in the context of k mesons . in practice , this model of @xmath72 and its nuclear behavior are close to the description of the @xmath114 used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where all the nuclear effects enter via the @xmath101 of eq.([shi ] ) .",
    "the nuclear shift @xmath107 has a surprisingly small effect on the depth of the @xmath0 meson optical potential well but it reduces the absorption strength . when included into the scattering matrix this shift produces an effective scattering length in the nuclear medium @xmath115 and the optical potential depth @xmath116 mev .",
    "this value is used in further calculations .",
    "another but related point to discuss is an effect of the nuclear absorption on the nuclear properties of the @xmath117 .",
    "the integral in eq.([shi ] ) is normalized in such a way that its imaginary part yields a half width for this state .",
    "this width may be changed by a collision damping process i.e. the @xmath118 reaction . in the previous section this process",
    "was related to the experimental @xmath119 cross section and this relation has generated the two nucleon absorptive potential @xmath21 .",
    "one might be tempted to include this process also into eq.([shi ] ) introducing complex energies @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "corrections to the optical potential obtained in this way are found to be small both for the real and the absorptive parts .",
    "however , as such a method is model dependent these corrections have been dropped altogether .",
    "the basic difference between this and previous calculations is that the @xmath0-n model used here produces the @xmath0- nuclear optical potential well to be much deeper than those due to other models .",
    "the nuclear states of eta mesons are thus bound much more strongly . on the other hand ,",
    "the absorptive part of this potential is comparable to results obtained elsewhere .",
    "the effect of two nucleon capture modes calculated directly from the scattering cross sections is rather moderate .",
    "it enlarges the level widths , in particular those of the s states , by about @xmath122 mev . on the other hand , widths of higher angular momentum states localized at the nuclear surface",
    "are less affected , since they involve @xmath123 terms .",
    "some quasibound state energies and half widths in are given in table i .",
    "these were calculated with the nuclear densities following the electric charge profiles .",
    "in addition to those states there may arise resonances generated by the centrifugal barrier .",
    "for example , a resonance in a g wave is likely to be formed in this way in pb .",
    "a similar calculation has been performed in very light nuclei . in particular , @xmath65 wave bound states were obtained in @xmath126he and @xmath127he with the complex energies of @xmath128 and @xmath129 mev .",
    "the latter system is of interest in the context of experiments planned at the brookhaven laboratory @xcite , where it may be observed as a final state .",
    "the energy given above is based on the structure and radius of @xmath127he found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another effect of the strong attraction is that high angular momentum bound states arise",
    ". some of those upper states may depended on details like : neutron density distributions , the distribution of nuclear momenta in the surface region and the range of @xmath23n forces which have not been discussed here .",
    "these effects are of secondary importance and should be discussed only if there is a significant experimental progress in this field .",
    "the upper bound states are slightly narrower and in some cases may be separated from the region of strongly overlapping lower states . the experimental search for those states may turn out to be easier .    acknowledgements .",
