    "the measured energy dependence for the aforementioned exclusive cross sections exhibits substantially different behaviour compared to that for @xmath19 .",

    "the charged particle acceptance covers laboratory polar angle @xmath26 between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , corresponding to about 92% of the total solid angle in the c.m .",
    "charged hadron identification is provided by @xmath29 measurements in the cdc , an array of 1188 aerogel cherenkov counters ( acc ) , and a barrel - like array of 128 time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) ; information from the three subdetectors is combined to form a single likelihood ratio , which is then used in kaon and pion selection .",
    "electromagnetic showering particles are detected in an array of 8736 csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) that covers nearly the same solid angle as the charged particle tracking system .",
    "electron identification in belle is based on a combination of @xmath29 measurements in the cdc , the response of the acc , and the position , shape and total energy deposition of the shower detected in the ecl .",
    "the electron identification efficiency is greater than 92% for tracks with @xmath30  gev/@xmath31 and the hadron misidentification probability is below 0.3% .",
    "the magnetic field is returned via an iron yoke that is instrumented to detect muons and @xmath32 mesons .",
    "muons are identified based on their penetration range and transverse scattering in this klm detector . in the momentum region",

    "it is important to note here that , due to the very low momentum of the photon from the @xmath75 decays , the @xmath76 events ( where the reconstructed @xmath35 is the one from @xmath77 ) produce a peak in the @xmath67 distribution at about the same position as @xmath76 events , where the reconstructed @xmath35 is the prompt one .",
