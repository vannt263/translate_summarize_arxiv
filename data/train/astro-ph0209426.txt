    "disk accretion to a rotating magnetized star is important in a number of astrophysical objects , including t tauri stars ( edwards _ et al . _ 1994 ) , cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , warner 1995 ) , and x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , bildsten _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "the accretion of matter to a rotating star with a dipole magnetic field is a complicated problem still only partially solved .",
    "the important questions which need to be answered include : ( 1 ) what is the structure of the disk near the magnetized star ? ( 2 ) where is the inner radius of the disk ? ( 3 ) what is the nature of the funnel flows ( ff ) ?",
    "for example , which force is dominant in lifting matter to the funnel flow ? ( 4 ) how is the accretion rate influenced by the star s magnetic moment @xmath3 and angular velocity @xmath4 ? ( 5 ) what is the mechanism of angular momentum transport between the star and the disk ?",
    "what determines whether star spins - up or spins - down ?",
    "( 6 ) what are the necessary conditions for magneto - centrifugally driven outflows from the disk and/or the star ?",
    "many of these questions have been investigated analytically , but the conclusions reached by different authors often differ because the simplifying assumptions are different . for example , regarding question ( 2 ) , some authors conclude that the disk should be disrupted in the region where magnetic and matter stresses are comparable ( e.g. , pringle and rees 1972 - hereafter pr72 ; davidson & ostriker 1973 ; lamb , pethick & pines 1973 ; ghosh , lamb , & pethick 1977 ; scharlemann 1978 ; ghosh & lamb 1979 a , b - hereafter gl79a , b ; camenzind 1990 ; knigl 1991 ; shu it et al .",
    "hereafter s94 ) .",
    "others , argue that the inner radius of the disk should be farther away , at the corotation radius , because the inner regions of the disk are disrupted by magnetic braking ( ostriker & shu 1995  hereafter os95 ; branderburg & campbell 1998 ; elstner & rdiger 2000 ) .",
    "question ( 3 ) is investigated in only a few papers which use the bernoulli integral ( lamb , pethick & pines 1977 ; paatz & camenzind 1996  hereafter pc96 ; li & wilson 1999 ; and koldoba _ et al .",
    "the authors agree that the flow should become supersonic ( and slow magnetosonic ) just above the disk . on the other hand opinions",
    "differ regarding the driving force which pushes matter up into the ff .",
    "li and wilson ( 1999 ) ( see also li et al . 1996 ) propose that the twisting of the magnetic field near the base of the ff should be very large , @xmath5 and the magnetic force should be the main one lifting matter to the ff . here , @xmath6 is the toroidal component of the magnetic field and @xmath7 is the poloidal component .",
    "other groups ( e.g. , lamb et al .",
    "1977 ; pc96 ; koldoba et al . 2002 ) argue that the ff should be super - alvnic so that the twisting of the field is small so that the magnetic force is also small . in numerical simulations by ms97 , h97 and",
    "gbw99 the magnetospheric accretion was reported , but no clear evidence of funnel flows was presented and no analysis of ffs was performed . a significant part of this paper is devoted to the ffs .",
    "another important issue which has been discussed over the past @xmath8 years is question ( 5 ) concerning the transport of angular momentum between the disk and the star .",
    "what determines the sign of the torque on the star ?",
    "in early papers it was supposed that a star can only be spun - up because matter in a keplerian disk brings positive angular momentum to the star ( e.g. , pr72 ) .",
    "later , it was recognized that a star can be spun - down due to the part of the star s magnetic flux which passes through the disk outside of the corotation radius ( gl79b , wang 1995 ) .",
    "recently , the idea of `` torqueless '' accretion was proposed where mass but not angular momentum is transported to a star ( e.g. s94 ; os95 ; li , wickramasinghe & rdiger 1996 ; li & wickramasinghe 1997 ) .",
    "wang ( 1997 ) presented arguments against this idea , but this still remains an open question .",
    "question ( 6 ) regarding magneto - centrifugally driven outflows from the disk has been discussed by a number of authors ( e.g. , camenzind 1990 ; knigl 1991 ; s94 ; os95 ; lovelace , romanova & bisnovatyi - kogan 1995 - hereafter lrbk95 ; fendt , camenzind & appl 1995 ; pc96 ; goodson & winglee 1999 ; bardou & heyvaerts 1999 ; agapitou & papaloizou 2000 ) .",
    "for example , s94 proposed that poloidal magnetic flux accumulates near the corotation radius and magnetic winds should blow from this point ( x - point ) .",
    "lrbk95 proposed that wind may form from the entire region of the disk outside the corotation radius where the magnetic field threading the disk is open .",
    "analytical investigations of disk accretion to a magnetized star are of course limited by the different assumptions made .",
    "for this reason robust 2d and 3d simulations are essential to further the understanding of the different phenomena . by robust we mean that the result should not depend on initial conditions , boundary conditions , on grid resolution , and other artificial factors .",
    "several 2d mhd simulation studies have been made with different initial conditions aimed at disk / star outflows . in an early work hayashi , shibata , and matsumoto ( 1996 ) ( hereafter hsm96 ) investigated the interaction of a non - rotating star with a keplerian accretion disk and observed the opening of magnetic field lines which initially thread both the star and the disk .",
    "they found single event outflows and the corresponding inward collapse of the disk on a dynamical time - scale ( less than one period of rotation of the inner radius of the disk ) with the radial velocity of the disk close to free - fall .",
    "this fast evolution was the result of the magnetic braking of the disk by the magnetic field linking the disk and non - rotating star through a conducting corona .",
    "this explosive behavior may correspond to some episodic accretion events of actual systems .",
    "however , it is important to investigate the possible quiescent behavior of the disk - star systems .",
    "miller and stone ( 1997 ; hereafter ms97 ) investigated disk - star interaction for different geometries and stellar magnetic fields using the resistive zeus code .",
    "ms97 rotated the corona - which occupies all the space between the star and the disk - with the rotation rate of the star .",
    "this decreased the initial magnetic braking ( compared to hsm96 ) , so that they were able to perform simulations for several periods of rotation of the inner radius of the disk . in cases with a relatively weak magnetic field , they got results similar to those of hsm96 .",
    "they also found the disk collapsing to the star with velocity @xmath9 , the opening of magnetic field lines , and outflows of matter from the disk .",
    "however , in the case of a strong magnetic field , particularly in the case which included a uniform homogeneous vertical magnetic field threading the disk , they observed diminished outflows .",
    "instead the matter flowed around the magnetosphere to the star .",
    "similar results were obtained by hirose et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter h97 ) .",
    "goodson , winglee and bhm ( 1997 ) ( hereafter gwb97 ) and goodson , bhm and winglee ( 1999 ) ( hereafter gbw99 ) did much longer simulations in very large simulation regions .",
    "they observed quasi - periodic matter outbursts associated with the quasi - periodic opening of magnetic field lines and matter accretion to the star .",
    "the density in the corona was chosen to decrease in a special way , @xmath10 , so that the alfvn speed @xmath11 decreases gradually .",
    "this is favorable for the opening of magnetic field lines , and for the generation and propagation of outflows .",
    "gwb97 and gbw99 do not investigate cases where the density falls off more slowly with distance .",
    "fendt and elstner ( 1999 , 2000  hereafter fe99 , fe00 ) investigated disk - star interaction for thousands of rotations of the inner radius of the disk , and observed the opening of magnetic field lines and outflows",
    ". however , they treated the disk as a boundary condition so that they could not take into account the back reaction of the disk on the stellar magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , the actual outflow of matter from the disk to the corona may be different from that assumed .",
    "the above  mentioned simulation studies show that outflows appear either in very non - stationary situations ( hsm96 , ms97 ) or for a special distribution of coronal density and very fast rotation of the star ( gwb97 , gbw99 ) .",
    "none of the papers give answer to questions ( 1)-(5 ) . also , it is not clear whether or not outflows exist for more quiescent initial conditions , and for cases where the coronal density falls off slowly with distance .    in this paper",
    "we investigate disk accretion to a rotating magnetized star and the associated funnel flows .",
    "we start from initial conditions which give us the possibility to significantly reduce the initial magnetic braking between the disk and the corona .",
    "this allows us to investigate the disk - star interaction and funnel flows for long times and to consider questions ( 1)-(5 ) in detail .    in  2",
    "we describe the numerical model , including initial and boundary conditions .",
    "we also discuss the evolution of the disk without a magnetic field . in ",
    "3 we describe in detail the disk - star interaction for the case of slowly rotating stars and in  4 cases of fast rotating stars . in ",
    "5 we consider the dependence of disk - star interaction on the magnetic moment @xmath3 . in  6",
    "we analyze the physics of ffs . in  7 we consider the possibility of outflows . in  8",
    "we apply our simulation results to t tauri stars . in  9 give the conclusions from this work .",
    "to investigate the disk - star interaction , we numerically solve the mhd equations , @xmath12 @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is entropy , @xmath15 @xmath16 is the stress tensor , @xmath17 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath18 is the gravitational potential of the central object .",
    "we take the equation of state to be @xmath19 , where @xmath20 for most of this work .",
    "we solve equations ( 1)-(4 ) in a spherical coordinate system @xmath21 .    in order to model the slow accretion of matter in the disk we modified equations ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) by including a small viscous stress @xmath22 in @xmath23 . because the flow is dominantly in the azimuthal direction the main viscous stress acts in this direction .",
    "thus the important viscous stress components are the @xmath24 and @xmath25 terms , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is angular velocity of the matter , and @xmath29 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "we adopt the @xmath30 model for the viscosity ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , where @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the isothermal sound speed velocity and @xmath33 is a dimensionless parameter , which was chosen to be @xmath34 or @xmath35 in most of simulations which gave a reasonable speed of matter flow to the central regions .",
    "we checked that for the grid sizes used the numerical viscosity is much lower than the considered @xmath36 viscosity ( see  2.5 ) .",
    "equations ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) were solved with a godunov type numerical code developed and tested by koldoba _",
    "( 1992 ) , koldoba and ustyugova ( 1994 ) and ustyugova _",
    "this type of code has also been described by ryu , jones , and frank ( 1995 ) .",
    "a modified version of the code incorporating viscosity was tested in a number of hydrodynamic simulations for different values of @xmath36 , from @xmath34 to @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath38 we observed a steady flow of matter to the star with small velocities ( see  2.5 ) corresponding approximately to the shakura - sunyaev accretion model .",
    "our godunov type code does not explicitly include magnetic diffusivity ( unlike the codes of ms97 , h97 , & gbw99 ) . however , matter diffuses across the magnetic field owing to the small numerical diffusivity @xmath39 which is of the order of the numerical viscosity @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the grid spacing .",
    "the estimated magnetic reynolds number associated with the radial flow is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the characteristic scale . in the region",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 owing to the small radial velocity @xmath46 . in actual accretion disks , both angular momentum transport and diffusion of the magnetic field , are probably due to turbulence ( e.g. , bisnovatyi - kogan & ruzmaikin 1976 ; balbus & hawley 1991 ) and have similar order of magnitude transport coefficients . in our simulations",
    "we observed that both the viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity are small and are of the same order of magnitide .",
    "note , that in the @xmath47 direction , the velocity of the flow is high , and the reynolds number is also high , @xmath48 , so that magnetic field lines rotate with the disk in @xmath47 direction , and at the same time matter slowly diffuses in @xmath49direction .",
    "this is important for understanding of evolution of magnetic field lines observed in the following sections .",
    "a reference value of distance is denoted @xmath50 .",
    "the reference value for velocity is taken to be @xmath51 which is the keplerian velocity at @xmath50 . the reference angular rotation rate is @xmath52 , and the corresponding time - scale is @xmath53 . for discussing our results",
    "we also use the rotation period at @xmath54 , @xmath55 . for a given magnetic field strength at @xmath50 we can define a reference density as @xmath56 and reference pressure @xmath57 .",
    "a reference magnetic moment of the star is then @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the calculated variables are : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "we also use the dimensionless time , @xmath65 .",
    "later , we omit the primes but note that any dimensionless variable can readily be converted to its physical value .    here , we give parameters for a typical t tauri star .",
    "we take the mass and radius of the star to be @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we use as the length scale @xmath50 the initial inner radius of the disk , so that the dimensionless inner radius of the disk is @xmath68 in most of simulations .",
    "we place the inner boundary ( a star ) at @xmath69 .",
    "then , our reference length is @xmath70 , while the simulation region corresponds to @xmath71 .",
    "the reference velocity is @xmath72 , and the corresponding time - scale is @xmath73 .",
    "the period of rotation of the inner radius of the disk is @xmath74 .",
    "consider a magnetic field strength @xmath75 at the star s surface .",
    "then at @xmath76 , the reference magnetic field is @xmath77 and the reference magnetic moment is @xmath78 .",
    "the reference density is @xmath79 , or @xmath80 which is typical for t tauri star disks .",
    "the reference mass accretion rate is @xmath81 . the reference angular momentum flux is : @xmath82 .",
    "we place the inner boundary of the simulation region - the `` star '' - at @xmath69 .",
    "the size of external boundary depends on the grid ( see below ) .",
    "the spherical grid was inhomogeneous in the @xmath83direction .",
    "the inhomogeneity was such that cells at any distance @xmath84 were approximately square with @xmath85 for fixed @xmath86 .",
    "this grid gives a high space resolution close to the star which is important in this problem . at the same time simulations in very large regions",
    "may be performed .",
    "the inhomogeneous grid is a smooth analog of the nested grids used by gbw97 and gbw99 .",
    "the angular grid was taken to have @xmath87 in most cases , and @xmath88 in cases with very strong magnetic field ( see  7 ) .",
    "the number of points in the @xmath83direction determined the size of the simulation region .",
    "the main runs were done with a large radial grid @xmath89 which corresponds to @xmath90 .",
    "simulations with a smaller grid @xmath91 corresponding to @xmath92 were done in a number of cases .",
    "the large size of the region was chosen in order to minimize the influence of external boundaries on processes in the vicinity of the star .",
    "we checked , however , that results of simulations in the larger region almost coincide with those in the smaller region .",
    "for the typical grid with @xmath87 , the smallest cell near the star corresponds to @xmath93 which is a resolution about @xmath94 times higher than one in gbw99 .",
    "the largest grid is at the external boundary , for @xmath89 and is @xmath95 .",
    "these numbers show that a spherical stretched grid is advantageous for simulations of accretion flow to a star with a dipole field .      at the inner boundary @xmath96",
    ", we apply  free \" boundary conditions for the density , pressure , and entropy , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "the inner boundary is treated as a rotating perfect conductor @xmath100 , which is analogous to the case of a rotating disk discussed earlier by ustyugova _",
    "( 1995 , 1999 ) . in the reference frame",
    "rotating with the star , the flow velocity @xmath101 is parallel to @xmath102 at @xmath96 ; that is , @xmath103 at @xmath104 .",
    "we consider the `` free '' boundary condition for this velocity , @xmath105 .",
    "these two conditions determine the direction and value of the velocity vector @xmath101 , that is all three components @xmath106 .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath104 on the magnetic field has @xmath107 , while the poloidal components @xmath108 and @xmath109 are derived from the magnetic flux function @xmath110 , where @xmath111 at the boundary is derived from the frozen - in condition @xmath112 .    at the outer boundary @xmath113 , we took fixed boundary conditions for all variables for those cases when the simulation region was very large : @xmath114 . in case of smaller region @xmath115 we took free boundary conditions on all the hydrodynamic variables and the @xmath6 component of the magnetic field , if matter _",
    "outflows _ from the region .",
    "for the magnetic field we took @xmath116 and @xmath117 if matter inflows to the region ( @xmath118 ) , then we set this velocity equal to zero .",
    "results are very similar at these boundary conditions .",
    "we assume reflection symmetry about the equatorial plane .      here",
    "we present our new method for establishing quasi - equilibrium initial conditions .",
    "the star has a magnetic dipole field with the magnetic moment @xmath119 aligned with the rotation axis @xmath120 , with @xmath4 the star s rotation rate .",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath121 with components in spherical coordinates @xmath122 and @xmath123 . as initial conditions we set up a low - temperature @xmath124 disk with a high - temperature @xmath125 corona filling the remainder of the simulation region .",
    "the disk rotates with angular velocity close to the keplerian value @xmath126 .",
    "the disk extends inward to the radius @xmath127 where the ram pressure of the disk is equals to the magnetic pressure of the dipole , @xmath128 .",
    "in order to have approximately equilibrium initial conditions it is necessary that the corona initially be rotating .",
    "if the corona initially does not rotate ( e.g. , hsm96 ) , or rotates with the angular velocity of the star ( e.g. ms97 ) , while the disk rotates with keplerian velocity , then the coronal magnetic field lines threading the disk and the star lead to magnetic braking of the disk and subsequent fast accretion of the disk with a velocity close to free - fall . furthermore , a strong discontinuity develops in the angular velocity between the disk and the corona ( except at the corotation radius ) .",
    "this leads to the generation of a strong @xmath6 component , while the dragging of the magnetic field with the radial inflow of the disk leads to the generation of a @xmath129 component .",
    "this twisting of the field is responsible for transient magneto - centrifugally driven outflows ( e.g hsm96 ; ms97 ; hirose et al .",
    "such fast evolution may correspond to periods of violent accretion in some strongly non - stationary systems .",
    "however , the star - disk systems may exist in more quiescent configurations which can be studied by using appropriate initial conditions .    in order to avoid the strong discontinuity of @xmath130 and @xmath6 on the boundary between the disk and the corona",
    ", we rotate the initial corona so that its angular velocity is a constant on a given cylindrical radius @xmath131 and equal to the keplerian rotation rate of the disk .",
    "thus the corona rotates with different angular velocities on cylinders with different radii @xmath132 .",
    "for such initial conditions we observe much slower accretion in the disk with no dramatic outflows .",
    "this distribution of @xmath130 in the corona also leads to the twisting of the magnetic field lines .",
    "any coronal magnetic field line will be twisted along its length by the differential rotation of nearby layers of corona , but this twist is distributed along the length of the field line . at the boundary between the disk and corona the twist is small .",
    "it is much smaller than the twist at the boundary between a rotating disk and non - rotating corona . differentially rotating corona also leads to the magnetic braking of the disk , but it is more gradual and does not lead to a rapid infall of the matter in the disk .",
    "earlier , a differentially rotating corona was used as an initial condition in a study of the opening of magnetic loops threading a keplerian disk , but the disk was considered as a boundary condition ( romanova _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "initially , we assume that @xmath133 everywhere .",
    "also , we assume that the initial poloidal field is that of a dipole and that the plasma is force - free . thus , we search for equilibrium initial conditions for the disk - corona system taking into account gravity , pressure , and rotation . to find the initial equilibrium , we suppose that initially ( @xmath134 ) the matter is barotropic @xmath135 .",
    "in this case one have ( 1 ) @xmath136 where @xmath137 ( 2 ) the angular velocity @xmath130 depends only on @xmath131 ; ( 3 ) the centrifugal force has the potential @xmath138 ^ 2r'dr'$ ] ; ( 4 ) the stationary euler equation @xmath139 has the integral : @xmath140 where @xmath18 is the gravitational potential .",
    "we suppose that the initial angular velocity of the matter in the equatorial plane is @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the cylindrical radius , and @xmath143 is included to take into account that the disk is slightly non - keplerian ( in our simulations @xmath144 ) .",
    "thus , the centrifugal potential in the whole region is @xmath145~ , &    r \\leq r_d \\\\ k gm / r~ ,   &   r \\geq r_d ~. \\end{array } \\right . \\eqno(7)\\ ] ]    at the boundary between the disk and corona the initial pressure is taken to be @xmath146 .",
    "the dependence of the density on pressure in the corona and in the disk can be expressed as @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the mean particle mass approximately equal to @xmath149 .",
    "we consider that @xmath150 . in the corona , at low values of pressure and density",
    "@xmath151 the plasma is hot @xmath152 , whereas in the disk , at high pressure and density ( @xmath153 ) the plasma is at a much lower temperature , @xmath154 .",
    "initially , the boundary between the disk and corona corresponds to the contact discontinuity , where @xmath155 , @xmath156 in the corona , and @xmath157 in the disk . in this case @xmath158",
    "the initial disk - corona boundary in the equatorial plane is assumed to be at @xmath159 .",
    "we assume values of @xmath160 @xmath161 and @xmath124 . at the point @xmath162 , @xmath155 , @xmath163 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath164 .",
    "then , we can calculate potential @xmath165 at any point @xmath166 and find @xmath167 .",
    "now , we can derive pressure @xmath168 at any point of the region , @xmath169 and find the distribution of density taking into account eq .",
    "we considered two main types of initial conditions which are described below .      in the first type of initial conditions , we place the inner radius of the disk at @xmath170 .",
    "we determine the characteristic density and temperature in the corona to be @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and density in the disk @xmath173 .",
    "then we determine the pressure at the boundary between the disk and corona , @xmath174 and then derive temperature in the disk , @xmath175 , so that the pressure is continuous across the boundary",
    ". then we determine the magnetic field of the star so as to have the magnetic pressure equal to the stagnation pressure of the disk matter at @xmath176 .",
    "this gives @xmath177 which is solved for @xmath3 .",
    "as matter in the disk flows inward , it forms a funnel flow at @xmath178 .",
    "we determine @xmath179 from equation ( 6 ) taking into account that @xmath68 . for @xmath180 matter",
    "rotates with an angular velocity corresponding to @xmath181 , while at @xmath182 the rotation is keplerian .",
    "the surfaces of constant @xmath130 are cylinders .",
    "for such a distribution , there are no strong gradients of @xmath130 in the region .",
    "then we derive the pressure and density distributions using equations ( 5)(10 ) .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 shows the density distribution in the disk and corona . for this example we took a relatively small region @xmath183 .",
    "one can see that the density is high in the disk , and is @xmath184 times smaller in the corona . for these initial conditions",
    "the ff starts close to the initial inner radius of the disk .",
    "thus the disk provides a  reservoir \" of matter for the ff . on the other hand",
    "there is the following disadvantage . in most cases , we rotate the star with an angular velocity @xmath4 smaller than the initial angular velocity of matter above the star . fortunately , the star is observed to control the rotation of the nearby regions of corona in a few time - steps .",
    "we also used initial conditions of type ii , as described below .      in a second type of initial conditions we place the inner radius of the disk @xmath127 at the corotation radius , @xmath185 .",
    "thus for @xmath180 both the star and the corona rotate with the angular velocity @xmath186 , while at larger distances the rotation is keplerian . for this initial condition ,",
    "@xmath130 varies smoothly including the variation from the star and to the corona above it .",
    "an important aspect of the type ii initial conditions is that the initial inner radius of the disk is far from the magnetosphere .",
    "this allows us to check whether or not matter moves inward from the corotation radius .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 shows the initial density distribution for type ii initial conditions for @xmath187 .",
    "first , we tested our initial conditions with no magnetic field .",
    "we observed that for both types of initial conditions the disk exists for more than @xmath188 rotational periods @xmath189 .",
    "no high velocities appear in the disk or corona .",
    "typical velocities in the disk are @xmath190 . however , our typical time of simulation of magnetic cases is shorter : @xmath191 , so that we show the result of the evolution of the disk without a magnetic field at @xmath192 .",
    "we considered three cases , with no viscosity , @xmath193 , and with small viscosities @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "figure 2 ( a , b ) shows that at @xmath194 and boundary conditions of type i , the disk s inner edge stays at @xmath195 during the whole period of evolution .",
    "the density in the rest of the disk slowly redistributes itself in such way that the external layers move gradually outward .",
    "the outer regions of the disk had excess angular momentum compared to a stationary @xmath36-disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , and consequently some matter moved outward carrying away extra angular momentum .",
    "when we included a small viscosity @xmath34 ( see panel @xmath196 of figure 2 ) , the outer regions of the disk also moved outward , but inside the shown region @xmath197 matter moves inward with velocity @xmath198 for @xmath199 , and with larger velocity @xmath200 for @xmath201 .",

    "for @xmath227 the accretion rate due to the @xmath30 viscosity increased and magnetic flux was accumulated in the central region .",

    "the ff is formed after about one period of rotation ( @xmath246 ) and is a stable feature during the length of the run , @xmath208 .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath240 line ( black line ) .",
    "the base of the ff coincides with @xmath247 ; that is ff starts in the area where the magnetic stress is equal to the matter stress .",
    "this is observed in many other cases with different parameters ( see  4 &  5 ) .",
    "this is in accord with theories developed in 1970 s ( pr72 , gl79a , b ) .",
    "we investigate the physics of ffs in  6 .",
    "matter from the outer region of the disk @xmath230 tends to accrete inward .",
    "often accretion rate is enhanced in the region where magnetic field has larger radial component @xmath129 and hence stronger magnetic braking .",
    "the accretion rate of matter from the region of the disk outside the ring varies with time .",
    "consequently , the density in the inner ring and in the funnel flows also varies with time ( figure 5 ) .",
    "when more matter accumulates in the ring , then the base of the ff is closer to the star , and the magnetospheric radius is smaller .",
    "for example , at @xmath248 ( panel b of figure 5 ) , @xmath249 ; at @xmath250 ( panel c ) @xmath251 .",
    "subsequently , for @xmath252 , even more matter came from the disk owing to viscosity , and the ff moved even closer to the star . a stationary state for @xmath253 may exist but at smaller values of @xmath36 , @xmath254 .",
    "for type ii initial conditions , the inner radius of the disk is taken to be the corotation radius , @xmath187 .",
    "the viscosity parameter is @xmath35 , the same as in the above - mentioned simulations .",
    "we were able of observe the evolution for more than @xmath255 rotations of the inner radius of the disk .",
    "figure 6 shows the evolution of the inner regions of the disk .",
    "we observed that the funnel flow did _ not _ form at the corotation radius as predicted in some theories ( e.g. , os95 ) .",
    "instead , the disk slowly moves inward towards the star owing to the viscosity ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "when the disk reached conditions where @xmath256 , the accreting matter goes up into the funnel flow .",
    "the ff formed after @xmath257 rotations . at longer times , the structure of the disk and the ff are similar to those found for type i initial conditions ( figure 5 ) .",
    "but one difference is that for type ii initial conditions the inward motion of the inner edge of the disk drags the bases of magnetic loops inward , so that loops of the dipole are inclined to the disk .",
    "such a situation is possible when the viscosity is larger than the diffusivity and magnetic flux in the disk accumulates closer to the star ( e.g. , s94 , os95 ) , but the rest of the loop in the corona does nt move so fast , so that the loops are inclined to the disk , and the @xmath129 component is significant . when the magnetic field is inclined away from the axis of the disk ,",
    "the magnetic force is much stronger than in case with no inclination ( lovelace , berk & contopoulos 1991 , oyed & pudritz 1997 ; fe99 , fe00 ) .",
    "we observed opening of the magnetic field lines close to the magnetosphere .",
    "the opening was followed by reconnection , and subsequent opening .",
    "the process was quasi - periodic with a quasi - period @xmath258 .",
    "we also observed quasi - periodic oscillations of the inner radius of the disk between radii : @xmath259 .",
    "the nature of the oscillations is the following : ( 1 ) first , the loop is stretched and the magnetic field",
    " blocks \" the path of matter to the ff .",
    "( 2 ) next , reconnection releases the stress , and matter accretes through the ff .",
    "( 3 ) the new loop starts to stretch , and the process repeats .",
    "figure 10 shows the quasi - periodicity of the accretion rate .",
    "these oscillations resemble those observed by gwb97 and gbw99 , but on a much smaller scale .",
    "h97 and ms97 also observed enhanced accretion after the reconnection of elongated magnetic field lines near the magnetosphere .",
    "this work supports the idea of aly & kuijpers ( 1990 ) who proposed this mechanism of quasi - periodic oscillations .",
    "we tested the dependence of the results on the viscosity for both types of initial conditions for @xmath34 and @xmath193 .",
    "we obtained similar results , but the ff formed at slightly larger distances @xmath132 as a result of smaller accretion rate . simulations with initial conditions of types i and ii have shown examples of possible situations which can be realized in nature . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we use the type i initial conditions , because the ff starts earlier in this case .",
    "how is angular momentum transported between the disk and the star ?",
    "does the star spin - up or spin - down ? in this section we analyze these questions using the run described in @xmath260 .",
    "we observed that the magnetic field lines which are responsible for the partial destruction of the disk at radii @xmath261 are also involved in the transport of angular momentum between the star and the disk .",
    "the magnetic filed lines connecting the star and the disk decrease the disk s angular velocity in a significant part of the braking region .",
    "figure 7 shows the radial distribution of the angular velocities at different times .",
    "one can see that the angular velocity of the disk is significantly smaller than the keplerian value in a broad region @xmath262 .",
    "we introduce the radius @xmath263 , such that for @xmath264 the magnetic force on the disk is strong enough to cause a significant deviation from keplerian rotation .",
    "the radius @xmath263 depends strongly on the accretion rate and varies between @xmath265 at @xmath250 , ( when the inner disk is of low density ) and @xmath266 at @xmath248 ( when the inner disk is dense ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the spatial distribution of the angular velocity , @xmath267 .",
    "one can see that for @xmath268 the regions of constant angular velocity @xmath269 almost coincide with the regions of constant magnetic flux @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the magnetic field line crossing the disk at radius @xmath132 rotates in the corona with angular velocity @xmath179 .",
    "this is because most of the corona is matter - dominated , @xmath270 ( see black line in figure 5 ) , and the disk determines the rotation of the magnetic field lines .",
    "magnetic field lines which cross the disk in the magnetically - dominated area ( in the ff ) rotate with the angular velocity of the star .",
    "an important question is the angular momentum flux to the star . to answer this question , we calculated the flux of angular momentum ( about the @xmath271axis ) carried by the matter @xmath272 and that carried by the ` twist ' of the magnetic field @xmath273 , @xmath274 evaluated at the surface of the star .",
    "in addition , we calculated accretion rate to the star , @xmath275 .",
    "figure 9 shows the different fluxes as a function of time .",
    "most of the angular momentum flux at the star is carried by the magnetic field ; matter carries only @xmath276 of the total flux .",
    "the flux @xmath277 is positive so that it acts to _ spin - up _ the star .",
    "the flux @xmath277 correlates with @xmath278 because incoming matter from distances @xmath279 is responsible for bringing in positive angular momentum . at distances @xmath280 the angular momentum flux",
    "is carried mainly by the matter .",
    "these results partially confirm the hypothesis of s94 , os95 , li et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that matter should carry little angular momentum as it approaches the star .",
    "however , our results indicate that this does not lead to the  torqueless \" accretion predicted by these authors , because the angular momentum flux carried by the matter is transferred to a flux carried by the magnetic field with decreasing distance from the star . the small twist of the magnetic field near the star , @xmath281 ( see  6 ) , is sufficient to carry the observed angular momentum transport flux ( see discussion by wang 1997 ) .    from our simulations we find that the magnetic field lines responsible for spin - up or spin - down of the star pass through the disk at distances @xmath282 .",
    "consequently the spin evolution of the star depends on the location of the corotation radius @xmath283 relative to @xmath263 .",
    "a star may spin - up , spin - down , or be in the regime of the  torqueless \" accretion ( see  4.2 ) . for the case considered in this subsection of a slowly rotating star @xmath187 , the star spins - up .",
    "we performed a set of simulations for different angular velocities of the star @xmath4 .",
    "simulations were done for type i initial conditions and with viscosity @xmath34 .",
    "the grid was @xmath284 corresponding to the smaller region @xmath285 .",
    "the fastest rotation considered was such that at @xmath286 , @xmath287 which corresponds to a rotation period @xmath288 for the t tauri parameters of  2.2 .",
    "( the conversion formulae for dimensional period is @xmath289 ) . in this section",
    "we discuss the dependence of the spin - up / spin - down rate of the star on @xmath4 .      here",
    "we discuss the case of a rapidly rotating star , @xmath287 , @xmath286 ( @xmath290 ) , where @xmath291 .",
    "we observed that initially the accretion disk moved outward because the magnetic field of the star transferred its angular momentum to the disk .",
    "later , for @xmath292 the disk started to move inward towards the star , and finally a funnel flow formed ( see figure 11 ) . in this case",
    "the thickness of the inner part of the disk is larger than that in the case of slowly rotating star , and matter accretes preferentially along the top layers of the disk .",
    "figure 12 shows the observed fluxes of matter and angular momenta to the star .",
    "note , that the flux of an angular momentum is carried mainly by the magnetic field , @xmath277 , which is negative so that the star spins down .",
    "thus , we observe that as matter _ accretes _ to the star angular momentum flows out from the star . as in the case of slowly rotating star ,",
    "we observe a correlation between the matter and angular momentum fluxes .",
    "we arranged a set of simulations to test if a particular value of @xmath4 gives `` torqueless '' accretion . according to gl79b , at some angular velocity of the star @xmath293 , positive magnetic torque associated with the region @xmath294 cancels the negative magnetic torque associated with the region @xmath295 and the star can accrete without changing its angular momentum .",
    "we performed simulations at different @xmath4 ( corresponding to @xmath296 and @xmath297 ) and observed , that for @xmath298 ( @xmath299 ) the angular momentum flux @xmath300 wanders back and forth around zero ( see figure 13 ) .",
    "that is , it is positive for some time ( @xmath301 ) , then becomes negative for a similar length of time , and then become positive again .",
    "we conclude that this @xmath4 corresponds to torqueless accretion .",
    "the explanation for torqueless accretion was proposed in the @xmath302s ( e.g. , gl79b ) .",
    "namely , when more matter is supplied to the disk , the magnetospheric radius @xmath1 moves closer to the star , and as a result there is a positive angular momentum flux to the star . when less matter accretes , the magnetospheric radius @xmath1 moves outward , and the flux of angular momentum is negative .",
    "figure 14 shows the evolution of the density and poloidal magnetic field for times corresponding to positive angular momentum flux to the star ( left panels ) , zero angular momentum flux ( middle panels ) and negative angular momentum flux ( right panels ) .",
    "the variations of the accretion rate may be connected with accumulation of matter at @xmath303 where in this case @xmath304 and subsequent accretion through instabilities .",
    "the ratio of the corotation radius @xmath283 to the magnetospheric radius @xmath1 is of general interest . at the moments when the torque is zero , @xmath305 ( see figure 13 ) , the magnetospheric radius had the following values : at @xmath306 , @xmath307 ; at @xmath308 , @xmath309 ; at @xmath310 , @xmath311 .",
    "that is , for @xmath312 the ratio is : @xmath313 . for similar simulations for faster rotation of the star @xmath314 ( @xmath315 ) , the angular momentum flux also wandered around zero value ( see figure 15 ) , but most of time it was negative so that the star spins down . for simulations with more slowly rotating stars or larger corotation radii , @xmath316 , ( @xmath317 )",
    ", we observed that the star spins up .",
    "we did simulation runs for different magnetic moments , @xmath318 and @xmath319 , with other parameters fixed , @xmath219 ( @xmath187 ) , and @xmath34 . at @xmath320 the inner radius at of",
    "the disk was at @xmath195 in all cases .",
    "the grid was similar to the one used in @xmath321 .",
    "figure 16 shows result after @xmath248 rotations .",
    "one can see that at smaller values of @xmath3 , the inner radius of the disk and ff are settled closer to the star than in the case of larger @xmath3 . in all cases , we observed that the base of the ff approximately coincides with the magnetosphere radius @xmath1 , but at smaller @xmath3 this radius is smaller in accord with equation ( 11 ) .    in case of",
    "even smaller @xmath3 the direct accretion to the surface of the star is observed , like in simulations by hsm96 and in some simulations by ms97 .",
    "the cases with stronger magnetic moment @xmath322 are more appropriate for explanation of t tauri stars , because the gap between the star and the disk is comparable or larger than the radius of the star . at smaller magnetic momenta @xmath323 ,",
    "the gap is too small .",
    "here , we discuss the physics of a typical funnel flow , the case of a slowly rotating star with @xmath187 (  3 ) after @xmath250 rotations .",
    "the specific heat ratio is @xmath324 .",
    "figure 17 shows an enlarged picture of the ff .",
    "we determined the variation of different parameters as a function of distance ( @xmath325 ) from the surface of the star along a fiducial poloidal field line through the middle of the ff .",
    "this field line is shown by the thick black line in figure 17 .",
    "figures 18  21 show the variation of different parameters along this field line .",
    "figure 18 shows that the density @xmath326 and pressure @xmath327 decrease along the ff , then increase again near the surface of the star .",
    "the temperature @xmath328 initially varies slowly , but increases strongly approaching the star as a result of gas compression .",

    "matter flows along the ff with poloidal velocity @xmath329 .",
    "the velocity perpendicular to the poloidal magnetic field , @xmath330 , is very small , @xmath331 .",
    "the poloidal velocity @xmath329 increases and becomes larger than the slow magnetosonic velocity @xmath332 at @xmath333 of the way .",
    "this point is expected to be closer to the disk in the case of cooler ( and thinner ) accretion disks ( koldoba et al .",
    "the flow become supersonic with the mach number reaching @xmath334 at the surface of the star . near the star ,",
    "the poloidal velocity is close to the free - fall velocity : @xmath335 .",
    "the poloidal velocity of the ff is much smaller than the alfvn velocity @xmath336 .",
    "the ratio decreases from @xmath337 in the middle of the ff , to @xmath338 at the star .",
    "thus , the flow is strongly sub - alfvnic .",
    "this validates the analysis of koldoba _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) which proposed that the funnel flows were sub - alfvnic .",
    "it is important to understand the forces which drive matter out of the equatorial plane of the disk into the funnel flow , and which forces accelerate the flow towards the star .",
    "the force per unit mass @xmath339 along the magnetic field line is obtained by multiplying the euler equation by @xmath340 .",
    "this gives @xmath341 ( ustyugova _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , where @xmath342 is the angle of the field line to the @xmath271axis .",
    "the terms on the right - hand - side represent the centrifugal force , the pressure gradient force , the gravitational force , and the magnetic force .",
    "figure 20 shows forces in the outer two - thirds of the poloidal path of the ff .",
    "we see that the pressure gradient force is responsible for driving matter up and out of the disk and into the funnel flow , while the gravitational force is responsible for the acceleration of matter in the rest of the ff .",
    "note that the magnetic force in equation ( 12 ) is small and acts in the opposite direction .",
    "thus , we did not observe the `` magnetic levitation '' force predicted by li & wilson ( 1999 ) .",
    "we observed a finite @xmath6 field above the disk in the ff ( see figure 21 ) , but the magnetic force is much smaller than the other forces and it is not sufficient to levitate matter above the disk .",
    "figure 21 shows that the angular velocity of the funnel flow decreases gradually from its value at the inner edge of the disk ( @xmath159 ) to a small negative value at the star . the negative value of @xmath130 at the star is due to the fact that the magnetic field has a small inclination in the direction of rotation of the star .",
    "for this reason matter moving along the magnetic field line comes to the star with an angular velocity less than @xmath4 ( see also ghosh et al . 1977 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "figure 21 shows the variation of the toroidal magnetic field along the funnel flow .",
    "the twisting of the dipolar field is relatively small with the `` twist '' @xmath343 . at the star ,",
    "this is in accord with estimations by wang ( 1997 ) , who has shown that the twist near the star should be small , but not a zero .",
    "away from the funnel flow @xmath345 is of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "we never observed conditions where @xmath346 ( discussed , e.g. , by gl79a and agapitou & papaloizou 2000 ) .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath347 , a torsional alfvn wave forms and propagates outward into the corona where it dissipates .",
    "in reality , matter may accrete through the magnetosphere owing to @xmath348 instabilities , for example , the rayleigh - taylor or kelvin - helmholtz instability ( arons & lea 1976a , b , spruit & taam 1990 ) .",
    "realistic investigations of the role of these instabilities is possible with @xmath348 mhd simulations .",
    "in our simulations we observed coronal magnetic field lines at large distances from the star opening due to the initial differential rotation .",
    "closer to the star the field lines were mostly closed , contrary to the predictions by aly ( 1986 ) , lrbk95 ( see also newman , newman , & lovelace 1992 ; livio & pringle 1992 ; lynden - bell & boily 1994 ; miki & linker 1994 , amari et al . 1996 ; fe99 ; fe00 ; ustyugova et al 2000 ; uzdenskyi , knigl & litwin 2002 ) . the difference in behavior can be explained as follows .",
    "the analytical or semi - analytical models suppose that the inertia of the of the matter is very small , @xmath349 , so that the plasma is in the  coronal \" limit of gold and hoyle ( 1960 ) . however , the inertia of the matter may be important .",

    "the energy - density of the dipole field decreases rapidly with distance ( @xmath353 ) compared with the matter energy - density in our simulations which varies slowly within the computational region .",
    "for this reason the magnetically - dominated region is restricted to a relatively small volume , @xmath354 , around the star ( see black line at figure 5 ) . to overcome this feature of the dipole field , gwb97 and gbw99 adopted a rapid fall - off of density in the corona , @xmath355 . for this dependence the region of small @xmath356",
    "is greatly expanded and opening of the magnetic field is favored .    in order to investigate possible stronger outflows , we chose parameters so as to increase the region of magnetically - dominated corona .",

    "the density in the corona was decreased @xmath360 times , @xmath361 .",

    "analysis of forces , similar to that of  6 shows that in the region @xmath366 , the centrifugal force drives matter along the magnetic field lines , but the force is not strong enough to open the magnetic field lines and matter accretes to the star forming multiple funnel flows ( see figure 22 ) . however , the outer magnetic field lines , which are located at the edge of the magnetically - dominated region , become gradually open owing to combination of centrifugal and magnetic forces .",
    "matter accelerates along the region of open field lines up to velocities @xmath367 , where @xmath368 is the escape velocity .",

    "however , recent spectral studies of t tauri stars show broad emission lines which give evidence of matter inflow with nearly free - fall velocities ( e.g. , hartmann et al .",
    "1994 ; lamzin , et al . 1996 ; muzerolle et al . 2001 ) .",
    "such velocities may be easily explained in the model where matter inflows supersonically in a funnel flow along a dipolar field .    in the following",
    "we perform numerical estimates for the funnel flow to a typical t tauri star using conversion scheme of  2.1 .",
    "we assume the inner radius of the disk is @xmath370 , the star s mass @xmath371 , its radius @xmath372 , and its surface magnetic field @xmath373 . using these values",
    "we can derive reference values for the different physical variables .",
    "for the flow velocity , @xmath374 .",
    "for the period of rotation at @xmath54 , @xmath375 .",
    "for the density , @xmath376 .",
    "for the accretion rate , @xmath377 .",
    "for the temperature of the corona , @xmath378 .    in the following we calculate the different physical variables along the middle of the funnel flow shown in figure 17 . from figure 19",
    "the matter reaches a maximum poloidal velocity @xmath379 at the star s surface , which is @xmath380 of the free - fall velocity @xmath381 .",
    "the funnel flow will of course give a distribution of velocities along the line of sight to a distant observer .",
    "the smallest line of sight velocities are for matter immediately above the disk where the speeds are @xmath382 of @xmath383 .",
    "the line of sight velocity distribution is important for the interpretation of observed spectral lines ( e.g. , folha and emerson 2001 ) .",
    "the poloidal velocity is @xmath384 the alfvn velocity @xmath336 above the disk ( at @xmath385 ) and decreases to @xmath386 at the star s surface .",
    "the velocity across the magnetic field lines @xmath330 is very small ( see figure 19 ) .",
    "thus , matter flows along the magnetic field .",
    "the flow become supersonic above the disk and the mach number reaches @xmath387 at the surface of the disk .    the initial density of matter in the disk at @xmath50 is @xmath388 , and the density of matter in the ff ( see figure 18 ) varies in the range @xmath389 which is typical for t tauri stars . our typical accretion rate to the star through the ff is @xmath390 , which agrees with estimates for t tauri stars ( hartmann _ et al .",
    "the initial temperature in the disk is @xmath391 which is several times higher than expected in the disks of t tauri stars at @xmath50 .",
    "as mentioned earlier this higher temperature is needed to give adequate resolution in the vertical direction through the disk .",
    "we observed that matter in the ff was heated by adiabatic compression to higher temperatures , @xmath392 .",
    "the fact that we use `` free '' boundary conditions at the surface of the star means that we can not account for the stand - off shock at the stellar surface , surface heating , and other physical phenomena close to the star .",
    "study of these processes can be done with a separate set of simulations .",
    "the investigated quasi - stationary funnel flows correspond to classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) ( see hartman 1998 ) where variability is not strong and possible outflows are weak .",
    "previous simulations of very fast accretion with subsequent strong outflows were done by hsm96 , ms97 , h97 , gwb97 , and gbw99 , and these may correspond to earlier stages of evolution of young stellar objects ( ysos of classes 0 and i ) which show evidence of episodic non - stationary accretion ( e.g. , fu orionis type stars ) and strong outflows ( e.g. hh30 ) .",
    "non - stationary accretion may be initiated by thermal instability ( lightman & eardley 1974 ) or by global magnetic instability of the disk ( lovelace , romanova , & newman 1994 ; lovelace , newman , & romanova 1997 ) , or by tidal interaction with a binary companion ( larson 2002 ) .",
    "we have done a wide range of mhd simulations of disk accretion to a rotating aligned dipole in order to understand the different accretion phenomena .",
    "the simulations show that funnel flows ( ff ) , where matter flows out of the disk plane and essentially free - falls along the stellar magnetic field lines , are a robust feature of disk accretion to a dipole . specifically , we find that      ( 2 ) .",
    "the velocity of matter in the ff is much smaller than the alfvn velocity , @xmath393 , so that matter flows along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the funnel flow accelerates and become supersonic .",
    "the mach number is @xmath394 at the surface of the star . at the star velocity",
    "is close to the free - fall velocity : @xmath335 .",
    "the angular velocity of the ff gradually varies from its value at the inner edge of the disk to the angular velocity of the star .",
    "the ` twist ' of the magnetic field lines in the ff is small , @xmath395 , and it has a maximum approximately in the middle of the ff .",
    "the main forces which are responsible for dragging matter to the ff are matter pressure gradient force ( near the disk ) and gravitational force in the rest of the ff .",
    "magnetic force is negligibly small .",
    "( 1 )   the magnetic field of the star influences the nearby regions of the disk inside a radius @xmath0 , while viscosity dominates at larger radii .",
    "the radius @xmath0 depends on magnetic moment of the star @xmath3 and density in the disk .",
    "( 2 ) .   inside the radius @xmath0",
    "the disk is strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "the density is @xmath397 times smaller than in the disk without magnetic field .",
    "magnetically braked matter accumulates near magnetosphere and forms a dense ring and funnel flow .",
    "the star may spin - up or spin - down depending on the ratio of its rotation rate to the rotation rate at the inner radius of the disk .",

    ", the angular momentum flux is transported mainly by the ` twist ' of the magnetic field .",
    "angular momentum carried by matter in the disk at @xmath279 is transferred almost completely to the magnetic field at the star s surface .",
    "the coronal magnetic field is observed to open and close , but strong outflows were not observed for the considered parameters and quasi - equilibrium initial conditions . in the area of the disk where the field is strong , @xmath399",
    ", the magnetic field lines tend to decelerate / accelerate rotation of the disk instead of being opened .",
    "besides , opening of magnetic field loops is suppressed by matter dominated corona compared to gbw99 who accepted dependence @xmath355 .",
    "strong outflows may be associated with strongly non - stationary accretion in the disk as observed in simulations by hsm96 , ms97 , and h97 or when the disk is very dense and magnetic field lines are inclined to the disk as in simulations by fe99 , fe00 .",
    "alternatively the outflows may occur in cases where the density of the corona decreases sufficiently rapidly with distance as in the simulations by gwb97 and gbw99 .",
    "sporadic outflows can arise from a global magnetic instability of the disk ( e.g. , lovelace _ et al .",
