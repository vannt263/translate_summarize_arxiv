    "recently a lot of theoretical and experimental efforts have been spent to find some new physics beyond that described by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the most popular ways to extend sm is to make our world supersymmetric at some higher scale than those currently tested by experimental facilities over the world .",
    "a way of doing it minimally and at the same time to have renormalizable local quantum filed theory is to consider the @xmath5 susy field theory .",
    "it is obtained from sm by replacing sm fields with groups of fields , forming representations of the @xmath5 susy algebra , and introducing an additional higgs doublet required by supersymmetry . this way we obtain the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "@xcite .",
    "huge theoretical research in this direction was made in the last few years as well as parameter space of this model was heavily constrained by experimentalists .",
    "today people consider radiative susy corrections to sm precision observables and try to observe susy particles directly in an experiment .",
    "the precision with which masses of heavy quarks are known at present , requires that higher order corrections , in addition to the leading one - loop susy corrections , be taken into account .",
    "it is the aim of the present article to calculate the `` leading '' @xmath0 mssm corrections to the pole masses of heavy quarks and to see how they affect the susy particle spectra obtained from the renormalization group analysis with universal boundary conditions at the gut scale .",
    "in fact we will be interested in the relation between the pole mass of a heavy quark and the running heavy quark mass .",
    "the latter is defined as a quantity computed in dimensional reduction and renormalized minimally . by `` leading '' corrections",
    "we mean those , which are mediated by strong interactions and formally they should be dominant . however , as it is known from one - loop calculations , in the case of @xmath6-quark there exists a large contribution from a stop - chargino loop enhanced by the @xmath7-quark yukawa coupling , @xmath8 or by the supersymmetric higgs mass parameter @xmath9 .",
    "so , in this sense , our results for the @xmath6-quark are not complete .",
    "but , they can be used to see the typical size of these corrections and already make some conclusions on whether they should be accounted for in an accurate analysis or not .    to compute needed diagrams we use the large mass expansion procedure and for the moment we restrict ourselves only to terms up to the @xmath10 order in the case of @xmath6-quark and up to the @xmath11 order in the case of @xmath7-quark .",
    "it is a good approximation for the @xmath6-quark .",
    "however , as our numerical analysis shows , such approximation does not work well in the case of @xmath7-quark and higher terms in large mass expansion should be taken into account .",
    "we suppose to calculate missing corrections from stop - chargino loops to the @xmath6-quark pole mass and to provide more terms in the expansion in a relation between the top pole and masses elsewhere . the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we define quantities we want to compute and make comments on the choice of our renormalization scheme . in section 3",
    ", we describe our model  the supersymmetric qcd ( a subset of mssm , relevant to the calculation of @xmath12 corrections ) and present in detail the renormalization procedure . section 4 contains our results and numerical analysis of the effect produced by our correction on supersymmetric particle spectra .",
    "the latter were computed with the help of the softsusy program @xcite under universal boundary conditions at gut scale .",
    "finally , section 5 contains our conclusion .",
    "first , we would like to note that there are several quark mass definitions .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that quarks were not ever observed as free particles .",
    "therefore , the definition of their masses rely heavily on theoretical constructions .",
    "different definitions exist referring to different renormalization schemes used in quantum field theories .",
    "we will mention only a few most popular ones  mass @xmath13 , pole mass @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 . in",
    "the nonsupersymmetric qcd the relations between these three masses are known ( to two - loops between and pole masses @xcite and to two @xcite and to three @xcite loops between and pole masses ) and in the supersymmetric qcd case there exists only one - loop relation between and pole masses of heavy quarks . in this work , we will establish the two - loop relation between and pole masses in supersymmetric qcd .",
    "in scheme , particle masses and couplings depend explicitly on the renormalization scale @xmath16 which is taken in applications equal to the characteristic scale of a studied process .",
    "the renormalization scale dependence of these quantities could be conveniently described by renormalization group equations .",
    "they are known very well for mssm and supersymmetric qcd .",
    "it should be noted that mass is a short distance quantity .",
    "that is , it is sensitive only to short distance effects . to describe processes with the characteristic scale of the order of quark mass itself , a different on - shell mass definition is used and here pole mass of a particle comes into play .",
    "the particle pole mass is defined by the singularity of the corresponding two - point function . as explicit perturbative calculations showed",
    ", the pole mass of a quark is an infrared finite and gauge invariant quantity .",
    "for this reason it is considered as a physically meaningful quantity @xcite .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to perturbation theory only and will not analyze the exact nature of the two - point function singularity which may involve some nonperturbative dynamics . in the present paper",
    ", we employ the definition of the pole quark mass , where it equals the value of @xmath17 , at which the inverse quark propagator turns to zero .",
    "the pole mass @xmath14 of a quark is defined as a formal solution for @xmath18 ( in the minkowski metric ) at which the reciprocal of the connected full propagator equals zero @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the one - particle - irreducible two - point function , @xmath15 may stand for the bare or renormalized mass , @xmath21 or @xmath22 , depending on the prescription used in evaluating @xmath23 .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ pole ] ) is sought order by order in perturbation theory . to two loops",
    "we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26-loop contribution to @xmath23 , and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the first argument . in what follows",
    ", we will be interested in the relation between the pole quark mass @xmath14 and the running mass @xmath15 computed in mssm up to the @xmath0 order . technically , to solve this problem , we need to evaluate @xmath27 two - loop propagator type diagrams involving many different mass scales ( see fig .",
    "[ twoloopdiag ] ) . in general , it is quite a complex problem to be solved exactly .",
    "however , in our case all mass scales can be divided into two groups denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , such that scales from @xmath28 are much less than each of the scales from the @xmath29 group    [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     here @xmath30 is the gluino mass , @xmath31 stands for different squark masses .",
    "we also explicitly denoted which mass scales belong to soft or hard groups in the cases of @xmath6- and @xmath7-quarks .",
    "given this mass hierarchy , one can employ the large mass expansion procedure to reduce evaluation of multi scale two - loop integrals to the calculation of single scale on - shell two - loop integrals , two - loop tadpole integrals with two scales and products of one - loop on - shell integrals and one - loop tadpole diagrams . to compute two - loop single scale on - shell integrals , we made use of the onshell2 package @xcite .",
    "for evaluation of two - loop tadpole diagrams with two scales , the recurrence relations of @xcite were used .",
    "calculation of one - loop self - energies , including their derivatives with respect to momentum , is an easy task and we will not make further comments on it .",
    "now let us make some comments on the choice of a renormalization scheme .",
    "here we use the same renormalization prescription , as in @xcite . to be more specific",
    ", we use regularization by dimensional reduction , a modification of the conventional dimensional regularization , originally proposed in @xcite . in this procedure , the vector and spinor algebras in the numerator of feynman diagrams are four - dimensional , which is the requirement imposed by supersymmetry .",
    "however , to make sense from divergent momentum integrals we need to regularize them by noninteger space - time dimension @xmath32 . for quantum corrections not to break gauge invariance , we need a cancellation of squared momenta in both the numerator and the denominator of feynman integrals .",
    "thus , the momenta should form @xmath33-dimensional subspace in four dimensions .",
    "as the momenta become @xmath33-dimensional , four - vectors naturally split into true @xmath33-vectors and so - called @xmath34-scalars , obtained in the process of dimensional reduction of the original four - dimensional lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath34-scalars are nothing , but matter fields .",
    "their appearance is the only difference from the conventional dimensional regularization .",
    "we would like to note that , in general , renormalization of @xmath34-scalars and their interactions is not identical to that of vectors , so the original four - covariance may be spoiled by quantum corrections .",
    "moreover , quantum corrections may also generate a mass for @xmath34-scalars .",
    "there is arbitrariness in choosing the renormalization scheme for this mass @xcite .",
    "a consistent way is to choose the finite @xmath34-scalar mass counterterm , so that the pole ( and renormalized ) mass of the @xmath34-scalars equals zero .",
    "the @xmath34-scalar field renormalization is left minimal .",
    "other renormalizations are done minimally , that is by subtracting only poles in @xmath34 .",
    "for our purposes here we do not need the complete mssm , but only its part  supersymmetric extension of qcd ( susy qcd ) . in the superfield formulation susy qcd lagrangian consists of two parts : the rigid supersymmetric part and the part containing soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",

    "one can see that two - loop correction to the relation between the @xmath6-quark pole and masses gives a sizeable contribution only to the solution obtained with the softsusy program for the @xmath6-quark mass at @xmath191 and almost does not influence spectra of susy particles .",
    "however , if one considers large @xmath8 it becomes important for other particle spectra and thus should be taken into account in an accurate rg analysis .",
    "note that our two - loop susy qcd correction for a wide range of parameter space is always less than a similar one - loop contribution .",
    "the two - loop mssm correction to the @xmath7-quark pole mass , on the other hand , contributes to almost all susy particle masses obtained as a solution of renormalization group equations with universal boundary conditions at the gut scale .",
    "this 2-loop correction is smaller than 1-loop mssm contribution , however its effect on particle spectra is greater then corresponding 1-loop and 2-loop mssm contributions to the @xmath6-quark pole mass almost everywhere in mssm parameter space .",
    "this could be attributed to potentially large corrections coming from higher terms in the @xmath199 expansion .    to see the dependence of @xmath192 on @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 , we use so called a set of benchmark points and parameter lines in mssm parameter space from @xcite which corresponds to different scenarios in the search for supersymmetry at present and future colliders .",
    "while a detailed scan over the more - than - hundred - dimensional parameter space of mssm is clearly not practicable , even a sampling of the three- ( four-)dimensional parameter space of @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 ( @xmath193 ) is beyond the present capabilities of phenomenological studies , especially when one tries to simulate experimental signatures of supersymmetric particles within detectors .",
    "for this reason , one often resorts to specific benchmark scenarios , i.e. ,  one studies only specific parameter points or at best samples the one - dimensional parameter space ( the latter is sometimes called a model line  @xcite ) , which exhibit specific characteristics of mssm parameter space .",
    "some recent proposals for susy benchmark scenarios may be found in @xcite .",
    "we refer to the `` snowmass points and slopes '' ( sps )  @xcite which consists of model lines ( `` slopes '' ) , i.e. , continuous sets of parameters depending on the one dimensionful parameter and specific benchmark points , where each model line goes through one of the benchmark points .    in fig.[fig",
    ": linea ] , we present the results for @xmath192 as functions defined along * model line a * @xmath203 where the benchmark point is @xmath204 here and below @xmath9 is the supersymmetric higgs mass parameter       as one can easily see from fig.[fig :",
    "linea ] , varying @xmath201 at fixed @xmath8 2-loop susy qcd correction to the @xmath6-quark pole mass almost does not contribute to heavy supersymmetric particle spectra .",
    "on the other hand , our correction to the @xmath7-quark pole mass is comparable to the corresponding 1-loop contribution .    in fig.[fig : linec ] , we present the results for @xmath192 defined as functions along * model line c * @xmath205 where the benchmark point is @xmath206       situation with fig.[fig : linec ] is analogous to that of fig.[fig : linea ] , even if we increase @xmath8 from 10 up to 35 .",
    "importance of our corrections increases only at very large values of @xmath8 ( 50 and more ) , as one can see from fig.[fig : tanb ] .",
    "for such a large @xmath193 we just used some particular values @xmath200 and @xmath201 from the allowed region from  @xcite .",
    "we use the following parameterization : @xmath207 the results for @xmath192 are shown in fig.[fig : linem ] and we can see that in this case our 2-loop correction to the @xmath6-quark pole mass gives a sizeable contribution to the masses of gluino and sbottoms .       now let us discuss our limiting formula eq.([limit ] ) .",
    "we have studied the difference between our full result and this approximate expression in different regions of mssm parameter space using the same strategy as above . as a result",
    "we find ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : limit ] ) that for the @xmath6-quark this difference does not exceed 12% for the parameters region considered above , both for the dependence on @xmath8 and @xmath201 . for the @xmath7-quark this is even better .",
    "we presented the results for two - loop mssm corrections to the relation between pole and running masses of heavy quarks up to the @xmath176 order .",
    "we provided a detail analysis of the value of these corrections in different regions of parameter space and discussed their impact on susy particle spectra .",
    "we would like to note that our results presented here may also be included in the codes of programs like isajet @xcite , suspect @xcite and used for predictive phenomenological analysis like @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in one of our next papers",
