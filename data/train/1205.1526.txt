    "this multiplicity fraction is likely a lower limit , since most searches have preferentially selected the potential hosts to be single star systems .",
    "such a high multiplicity fraction for exoplanet host systems indicates that despite the increased dynamical complexity of young multi - stellar systems , which lead to the truncation of individual circumstellar disks and the rapid clearing ( @xmath41000  yr ) of the inner regions of circumbinary(system ) disks , reservoirs of material frequently survive long enough for planets to form . stars commonly form in binary systems , so the fact that planets exist in these systems adds tremendously to the diversity and prevalence of planets in the galaxy @xcite .",

    "planetary systems can be considered to be binaries of extreme mass ratios .",
    "most of the mass gain of gas giant planets may occur by means of mass flow through the gap surrounding the orbit of the planet @xcite the gas flow through gaps in young planetary systems and onto circum - planetary disks plays a crucial role in the formation of the young planets .",
    "the physics of this process can be better understood with direct observational constraints placed on the similar processes that occur in young binary star systems .    in order to understand the formation of planets in young binary and multiple systems",
    ", we first must understand the ways in which the stellar cores interact with the gas and dust in their circumstellar environment .",
    "clues to the dynamics of these interactions and the structures in the circumstellar / system environment are revealed by spectral energy distribution measurements , high - spatial resolution observations , and hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "for instance , simulations showing how young binary systems quickly clear gaps in the inner regions of circumbinary disks also describe how material will fall through these gaps in `` high - velocity streams , '' eventually crashing into the individual circumstellar disks @xcite . high - spatial resolution millimeter and optical / near - infrared observations of nearby young binary systems like gg  tau  a clearly show that optically - thin regions exist between the circumbinary disk and the stellar components @xcite . however , these observations also strongly hint at the presence of streamers of material falling through the optically - thin , dynamically unstable region @xcite . more recently",
    ", a near - infrared high - resolution image of scattered light from sr  24 , a binary system in nearby the ophiuchus star forming region , clearly indicates the presence of circumstellar disks orbiting both the primary and secondary and a spiral arm - like stream of material extending some 1600  au from central sources toward a circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "the replenishment of the tidally - truncated , inner circum_stellar _ disks with material from the extended circum_binary(system ) _ disks is likely to aid the formation of planets in many binary and multiple systems .",
    "moreover , the recent discovery of kepler-16b , an exoplanet that lies within the same orbital plane as its central binary host , demonstrates the potential for planets to form within circumbinary disks @xcite . high - spatial resolution images capable of resolving emission from structures within a circumbinary region and near the inner circumstellar disks will be essential for studying the planet - building process in such systems . constraining existing hydrodynamical models , which form our basis for understanding the evolution of young multiple systems and their host planets , would be a meaningful step in unraveling the complexity of star and planet formation in the binary environment .",
    "as an exciting step toward this goal , we present the first spatially resolved image of molecular hydrogen gas located within the optically - thin , unstable region of the gg  tau  a system .",
    "this image provides strong support for the existence of suspected accretion `` streamers '' in this system .",
    "the material falling onto the inner ambient gas appears to create a shock front located in the dynamically unstable circumstellar environment of the stars .",

    "we use these data to estimate the mass and physical conditions of the emitting gas residing within the cleared region of the gg - tau  a s circumbinary disk .",

    "the gg  tau  a stars have changed their orientation by nearly 35 degrees , just under one tenth of the total angular orbit @xcite .",

    "for the first time , @xcite detected a possible streamer of dust emission in the mm wavelength map of the circumbinary ring around gg  tau  a. this streamer of dust was detected at a @xmath12@xmath19 level of confidence , and it seems to extend from the northern edge of the circumbinary ring inward to the north side of the central binary .",

    "interestingly , the location of the inner edge of the mm dust streamer corresponds precisely to the location where we detect the peak emission in molecular hydrogen gas .",
    "the presence of the peak h@xmath0 emission at a coincident location with the inner dust streamer lends further support that the streamer in the dust map is a real feature . additionally , @xcite report the existence of co emission from these regions , which would also support the existence of streaming gas interior to the circumbinary dust ring .    in the environments of young stars , most excitation mechanisms considered for",
