    "tracking control of an uncertain system is a challenging problem .",
    "most of research mainly focuses on systems subject to parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances @xcite-@xcite . also , some research focuses on systems subject to uncertainties at the input , such as backlash , dead zone or other nonlinearities @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is well known that unmodeled dynamics and time delay at the input are also often present in practical systems .",
    "for example , the unmodeled dynamics and time delay at the input often exist in flight control systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these uncertainties at the input may produce a significant degradation in the tracking performance or even cause instability if not dealt with properly . in the literature , there are some academic examples to demonstrate that uncertainties at the input can not be ignored in some cases . for example , in @xcite , the authors constructed a simple example , later known as _",
    "rohrs example , _ to show that conventional adaptive control algorithms lose their robustness in the presence of unmodeled dynamics .",
    "also , some control algorithms may lose their robustness in the presence of input delay , see for example the repetitive control example considered in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to explicitly consider unmodeled dynamics and time delay at the input in the controller design .    in this paper , the output feedback tracking control problem is investigated for a class of single - input single - output ( siso ) nonlinear systems subject to mismatching parametric uncertainty , mismatching additive disturbances , unmodeled high - frequency gains and time delay at the input . before introducing our main idea , some accepted control methods in the literature to handle uncertainties are briefly reviewed . a nature way is to estimate all of the unknown parameters , then compensate for them . in @xcite , the tracking problem for a linear system subject to unknown parameters and",
    "the unknown input delay was considered , where both the parameters and input delay were estimated by the proposed method . however , this method can not handle unparameterized uncertainties such as unmodeled high - frequency gains .",
    "the second way is to design adaptive control with robustness against unmodeled dynamics and time delay at the input . in @xcite , the rohrs example and the two - cart example , which are tracking problems for uncertain linear systems subject to unmodeled dynamics and time delay at the input respectively , were revisited by the @xmath0 adaptive control . in @xcite",
    ", the authors analyzed that their proposed method is robust against time delay at the input .",
    "the third way is to convert a tracking problem to a stabilization problem by the idea of internal model principle @xcite , if disturbances or desired trajectories are limited to a special case . in @xcite ,",
    "the problem of set point output tracking of an uncertain linear system with multiple delays in both the state and control vectors was considered .",
    "there also exist other methods to handle uncertainties .",
    "however , some of them such as high - gain feedback can not be applied to the considered system directly as they rely on rapid changing control signal to attenuate uncertainties and disturbance . after passing unmodeled high - frequency gains or time delay at the input , the rapid changing control signal",
    "will be distorted a lot which will affect the feedback and then may destabilize the system .",
    "this explains why high - gain feedback is often avoided in practice .",
    "compared with these existing literature , the problem studied in this paper is more general since not only the uncertainties at the input but also the output feedback and mismatching are considered . for output feedback",
    ", the state needs to be estimated which is difficult mainly due to the uncertainties and disturbances in the state equation . even if parameters and disturbance can be estimated , it is also difficult to compensate for mismatching uncertain parameters and disturbance directly . to tackle these difficulties ,",
    "two new mechanisms are adopted in this paper .",
    "first , the input is redefined to make it smooth and bounded to handle uncertainties at input .",
    "as a consequence , the effect of unmodeled high - frequency gains and time delay at the input is always bounded .",
    "and then , to handle estimate and mismatching problem ,  the input - redefinition system is transformed to an uncertainty - free system , which is proved to be input - output equivalent with the aid of the _ _ additive state decomposition _",
    "_ _ _ @xcite .",
    "all mismatching * * uncertainties , mismatching disturbance and effect of unmodeled dynamics plus time delay are lumped into a new disturbance at the output .",
    "an observer is then designed for the transformed system to estimate the new state and the new disturbance .",
    "next , the transformed system is ` additively ' decomposed into two independent subsystems in charge of corresponding subtasks , namely the tracking ( including rejection ) subtask and the input - realization subtask",
    ". then one can design controller for each subtask respectively , and finally combines them to achieve the original control task .",
    "three benchmark examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme .",
    "the additive state decomposition is a decomposition scheme also proposed in our previous work @xcite , where the additive state decomposition is used to transform output feedback tracking control for systems with measurable nonlinearities and unknown disturbances and then to decompose it into three simpler problems .",
    "this hence makes a challenging control problem tractable . in this paper , a different control problem is investigated by using additive state decomposition .",
    "correspondingly , the transform and decomposition are different .",
    "the major contributions of this paper are : i ) a tracking control scheme proposed to handle mismatching parametric uncertainty , mismatching additive disturbances , unmodeled high - frequency gains and time delay at the input ; ii ) a model transform proposed to lump various uncertainties together ; iii ) additive state decomposition in the controller design , especially in how to handle saturation term .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the problem formulation is given and the additive state decomposition is introduced briefly first . in section",
    "iii , input is redefined and the input - redefinition system is transformed to an uncertainty - free system in sense of input - output equivalence .",
    "sequently , controller design is given in section iv .",
    "in section v , two - cart example is revisited by the proposed control scheme .",
    "section vi concludes this paper .",

    "is decomposed into two subsystems with the same dimension as the original system . in this sense",
    "our decomposition is additive .",

    "case 2 implies the parameters are unknown . while , case 3 implies the parameters are changed to be a specified one .",
    "the simulations are shown in figs .",
    "the proposed controller achieves a good tracking accuracy .",
    "moreover , it is seen that the response in cases 2 - 3 is faster than that in case 1 . and , the tracking accuracy in cases 1,3 is better than that in case 2 .",
    "so , case 2 is a tradeoff between case 1 and case 3 .",
    "* remark 8*. the simulations show that the proposed controller can handle the case that the estimate parameters are different from the true parameters .",
    "moreover , the response is similar to that of the model with the estimate parameters .",
    "this implies that the proposed controller in fact achieves the results similar to model reference adaptive control .",
    "however , unlike model reference adaptive control , unknown parameters are not estimated and changed directly .    * remark 9*.",
    "if the considered system is parameterized but there exist many uncertain parameters , then an adaptive control often needs corresponding number of estimators , i.e. , corresponding number of integrators .",
    "this will cause parameters converging to true values with very slow rate or can not converge to true values if without persistent excitation .",
    "whereas , in the proposed control , five uncertain parameters and disturbance are lumped into the disturbance @xmath308 which can be estimated directly .",
    "output tracking control for a class of uncertain systems subject to unmodeled dynamics and time delay at input is considered .",
    "our main contribution lies on the presentation of a new decomposition scheme , named additive state decomposition , which not only transforms the uncertain system to be an uncertainty - free system but also simplifies the controller design .",
    "the proposed control scheme is with the following two salient features .",
    "( i ) the proposed control scheme can handle mismatching * * uncertainties and mismatching disturbance .",
    "moreover , it can achieve a good tracking performance without exact parameters .",
    "( ii ) the proposed control scheme has considered many uncertainties . in the presence of these uncertainties ,",
