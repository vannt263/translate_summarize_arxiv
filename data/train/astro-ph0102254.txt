    "the numerous optical and uv spectroscopic studies of supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the literature have resulted in a rich catalog of observed emission - line features ( cf . fesen & hurford 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "however , most of these studies do not extend much beyond 8500   due to the poor sensitivity of optical detectors farther to the red .",
    "only a handful of published snr spectra go out as far as 1.1  where the most commonly seen features are [ ] 9069 , 9532   , [ ] 9823 , 9850   , [ ] 1028710372   , and 10830  (e.g .",

    ", it is now possible to probe the spectra of snrs in the 1  5  wavelength regime , and there are a number of reasons to do so .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy can provide access to features that are nt available in optical and uv spectra , such as molecular species like h@xmath4 and co , which can provide valuable information about molecule formation and destruction in snrs .",
    "molecular emission can also often be used as an astrophysical probe , providing information about temperature , density , and excitation mechanisms .",
    "in addition , there are many strong lines of [ ] in the nir , which can be used as density diagnostics .",
    "these lines have higher critical densities than optical density sensitive lines , and thus can probe much higher densities ( @xmath5  @xmath6 @xmath3 ) .",
    "finally , the near - infrared contains several strong high - ionization species which have been seen in other objects like agns , novae , and planetary nebulae .",
    "these lines could provide important information about ionization processes and structures in supernova remnants .",
    "unfortunately , few nir spectra of supernova remnants currently exist in the literature",
    ". furthermore , there are almost no near - infrared data that take advantage of large - format array detectors allowing for spatially resolved long - slit spectroscopy and broad wavelength coverage .",
    "indeed , of the few datasets available , most were obtained with relatively large apertures ( @xmath75 20 ) in narrow wavelength regions typically covering only a single emission feature with each bandpass .    to date , the most comprehensive work on the nir spectra of supernova remnants has been the study of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath4 ) emission from shocks running into molecular clouds .",
    "this has been seen in ic  443 , rcw  103 , and the cygnus loop @xcite .",
    "h@xmath4 has also been detected in the crab nebula @xcite , presumably from dense , neutral cores of the emission - line filaments .",

    "two other weak lines near 1.08  and 1.13  could be emission from the [ ] doublet , but could also be due to ( or blended with ) 1.083  and 1.129",
    ". emission would be consistent with the presence of weak permitted lines seen in the optical spectra of cas  a fmks ( e.g. hf96 ) .    perhaps the most interesting near - infrared lines detected in the brighter fmks ( 1 , 2 , & 4 ) are those near the rest wavelengths of 1.43  and 1.96  .",
    "we identify these as high - ionization lines of silicon , [ ] 1.965  and [ ] 1.4305  .",
    "the detection of such high ionization species was unexpected as no other high - ionization lines are observed in optical or near - infrared spectra of cas  a. however , we could find no other likely line identifications that fit the observed wavelengths .",
    "there are weak h@xmath4 transitions at wavelengths near both lines , but we find no evidence of emission present from the much stronger h@xmath4 feature at 2.12  . also , the observed doppler shifts of these lines , if identified as [ ] and [ ] , are consistent with each other and match those of the other lines seen in the fmks to within the resolution of our data ( @xmath0 450 km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "the absence of these lines in the spectra of the fainter fmks is not significant as both of these lines suffer moderate telluric absorption and they could be too weak to detect in these fainter knots .",
    "this is the first detection of these high - ionization silicon features in the spectrum of a supernova remnant .",
    "omd90 looked for , but did not detect [ ] in their spectra of rcw  103 .",
    "however , the [ ] 1.965  line has been seen in planetary nebulae @xcite , and both the [ ] 1.965  and [ ] 1.4305  lines have been reported in nir spectra of the solar corona @xcite , novae @xcite , and agns @xcite . another high - ionization silicon line , [ ] 2.48  , has also been observed in many of these objects , but this line was outside the observed bandpass of the cas  a spectra shown here . however , in follow - up observations made in november 2000 this line was detected in 1.4  2.5  spectra of fmks  1  &  2 .",
    "nir spectra of novae often show other strong high - ionization features such as [ ] 1.252  , [ ] 1.392  , [ ] 1.550  , [ ] 1.736  , [ ] 2.040  , and [ ] 2.323  @xcite , none of which are seen in our cas  a data .",
    "( note : [ ] 1.252   would be blended with [ ] 1.257  , and [ ] 1.392  is obscured by strong telluric absorption ) . on the other hand , in near - infrared agn",
    "spectra the [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] lines are often the only strong high - ionization features seen in the 0.95  2.5  region .    near - infrared `` coronal '' line emission in novae , agns , and planetary nebulae is believed to be due to photoionization , although collisional ionization from hot , shocked gas often can not be ruled out .",
    "in contrast , the low - ionization optical spectra of cas  a s fmk knots have been modelled as shocks with a photoionized precursor component ( sutherland & dopita 1995 ; hf96 ) . observed ratios of lines at different ionization levels",
    "are explained in these models as a mixture of emission from the rapidly cooling post - shock region , and from a precursor in the ejecta out ahead of the reverse - shock which is photoionized by uv emission from the shock front .",
    "unfortunately , no predictions for [ ] and [ ] emission have been made so it is unclear if the shock / precursor models can explain these very high ionization lines .",
    "alternatively , the high - ionization emission might be understood with a pure photoionization model like those used to explain the high - ionization lines seen in novae , agns and planetary nebulae .",
    "the main shell of cas  a is quite bright in x - rays @xcite which could provide a strong photoionizing source .    in any case",
    ", it also seems likely that abundances play some role in the detection of these high - ionization silicon lines .",
    "spectral modeling of optical fmk spectra indicate significant enrichment of metal abundances , suggesting that fmks are gas from the inner regions of the exploded star ( * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , x - ray imaging of cas  a has detected bright silicon line emission from the main shell ejecta @xcite .",
    "all of this indicates that the fmks are likely silicon - rich and so it may be that only a small fraction of the silicon is highly ionized with the bulk of the gas in a much lower ionization state .",
    "however , without a detailed spectral model it is impossible to conclude that the detection of these silicon lines is merely an abundance effect as these lines are also detected in agns and planetary nebulae where the silicon abundance is much lower .",
    "in fact , with respect to the observed high - ionization lines , the cas  a spectra more closely resemble near - infrared agn spectra than nir spectra of noave , even though the gas in novae is probably closer in composition to the fmks .",
    "the optical spectra of shocked circumstellar knots in cas  a ( qsfs ) and kepler s snr are dominated by strong [ ] emission , with only a few other weak lines of h and he .",
    "these knots are thought to be nitrogen enriched material shed by the progenitor star prior to the explosion , and then shocked by the expanding blast wave @xcite .",
    "the nir spectra of these knots seem consistent with this picture , exhibiting an ism - like spectrum with the strong [ ] emission typical of shocked gas .",
    "the cas  a qsfs and the kepler knot are relatively bright in the near - infrared , especially in the _ j _ ( @xmath71.2  ) and _ h _ ( @xmath71.6  ) bands due to this rich [ ] spectrum .",
    "in addition to the [ ] lines , these circumstellar knots also show strong 1.083  emission , as well as the [ ] 1.03  blend , [ ] 0.9827  , 0.9853  , 2.058  , and faint hydrogen lines ( pa@xmath13 1.0941  , pa@xmath14 1.2822  , and br@xmath13 2.1661  ) .",
    "in fact , our qsf and kepler spectra resemble the 1.42.4  spectrum of the optically brightest region of rcw  103 presented by omd90 except that no h@xmath4 emission was seen .",
    "several of the observed [ ] line ratios can be used as density diagnostics ( e.g. nussbaumer & storey 1980 ; omd89 ; omd90 ) . using the dereddened ratios of the 1.5339  , 1.5999  , and 1.6642   lines to the strong 1.6440  line and the predicted ratios of omd90 , we estimated electron densities for each of the three qsfs in cas  a and for the kepler knot .",
    "the results are shown in table [ dentab ] . in each case , the various line ratios all gave mutually consistent estimates of the electron density for a given knot .",
    "the dereddened line ratios in each of the three qsfs observed in cas  a are indistinguishable to within the measurement errors and yield electron densities of 5  9  @xmath1  10@xmath2  @xmath3 , which approach the high - density limit of the [ ] lines .",
    "the density of the kepler knot is roughly half that measured in the cas  a qsfs , namely 2.5 ",
    "3.1  @xmath1  10@xmath2  @xmath3 .",
    "our estimate for the density of kepler is somewhat higher than that measured at roughly the same position by omd89 , although it might be consistent with their upper limit .",
    "differences in density estimates are not unexpected as omd89 used a larger aperture ( 58  @xmath1  59 vs.  our 06 slit ) and therefore sampled a much larger region of the remnant s northwest emission filaments .",
    "although electron densities in the three observed cas  a qsfs are similar , the to [ ] emission ratio varies dramatically .",
    "this is seen in figure [ qsfcomp ] which shows the observed nir spectra of qsf  2 and qsf  3 . in qsf  2 ,",
    "the 1.083  line is much brighter than the brightest [ ] lines , while in qsf  3 , these lines are of nearly equal strength .",
    "table [ dentab ] lists the dereddened 1.083  to [ ] 1.257  line ratio which varies by nearly a factor of five in the three qsfs observed in cas  a. the observed variation could be due to temperature effects or compositional differences in the knots , for instance , in the depletion of gaseous iron into dust grains .",
    "_ j_- and _ k_-band mosaic images of cas  a are presented in figures [ casajim ] and [ casakim ] respectively . in both images ,",
    "the brightest emission comes from the qsfs . in _",
    "j_-band , this emission is almost entirely due to strong [ ] lines , while the _ k_-band emission is a mixture of [ ] , , and br@xmath13 .",
    "the relative brightness of the qsfs in the two bands ( i.e. the @xmath15 color ) changes from knot to knot , and the nir luminosity is poorly correlated with the optical luminosity .",
    "this may be related to the large variation of the observed 1.083  to [ ] 1.257  line ratio seen in the nir spectra of the qsfs .",
    "the fmk ejecta knots are also clearly visible in the _",
    "j_- band image . in this case , the emission is a mixture of weak [ ] and [ ] emission lines .",
    "some fmk filaments are also visible in the _ k_-band image , particularly in the inner regions of the remnant .",
    "the spectra of the bright northern fmks showed no emission in _",
    "k_-band , but the [ ] 1.96  line lies at the blue edge of the _ k_-band filter .",
    "k_-band filter may be picking up [ ] emission from filaments with large positive radial velocities .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the filamentary emission in _",
    "k_-band largely disappears near the rim of cas  a , and is seen primarily in the inner regions of the remnant where the radial velocities are largest .    the dominant feature in the _",
    "k_-band image is diffuse emission which forms a nearly complete ring around the rim of cas  a and also fills some of the interior .",
    "this diffuse emission can be faintly seen in the _",
    "j_-band image near the center and at several positions on the rim .",
    "this diffuse emission has no optical counterpart and does not correspond well to x - ray or mid - ir images of cas  a either ( cf .",
    "hf96 ; lagage et al .",
    "1996 ) , but it does exhibit morphological similarities to radio continuum images ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "some hint of the morphological differences between _ k_-band and optical images has been seen in the 2mass images of cas  a @xcite .",
    "the lack of any detected diffuse line emission in the 2-d spectra of fmks and qsfs on the rim ( specifically fmks 1 & 2 , and qsfs 1 & 2 ) suggest that the diffuse emission is continuum rather than line emission .",
    "the large morphological differences between the _ k_-band and mid - ir images , and the detection of the diffuse emission in _",
    "j_-band argue against thermal dust emission as a source .",
    "the thermal dust emission seen in the mid - infrared is well correlated to the optical knots @xcite , and the detection of thermal emission in _ j_-band would probably require prohibitively high dust temperatures at or above typical grain destruction limits .",
    "on the other hand , the morphological similarity of the diffuse emission with radio continuum images suggests that the diffuse _",
    "k_-band emission may be infrared synchrotron radiation .",
    "we have presented the first near - infrared ( nir ) spectra of a young , metal - rich supernova remnant .",
    "the spectra of fast - moving ejecta knots in cas  a are dominated by [ ] 1.03  emission , but show several other faint emission lines including high - ionization lines of [ ] and [ ] .",

    "interestingly , the silicon lines represent a much higher ionization state than the observed optical and near - infrared emission lines .",
    "therefore , further study of the spatial distribution of the [ ] and [ ] line emission may provide valuable information about the ionization structure in the metal - rich cas  a ejecta .",
