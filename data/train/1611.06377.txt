    "in this paper we study obstructions for compactness of hankel operators on general pseudoconvex domains in @xmath1 .",
    "one of the most stimulating results for compactness of hankel operators is due to axler @xcite , which states that on the bergman space of the unit disc the hankel operator @xmath2 for a holomorphic function @xmath3 , is compact if and only if @xmath3 is in the little bloch space @xmath4 . in particular ,",
    "if the holomorphic function @xmath3 is additionally smooth up to the boundary then @xmath3 is automatically in the little bloch space and hence the operator @xmath2 is compact .",
    "however , on a general domain in @xmath1 if we take a holomorphic symbol @xmath3 that is also smooth up to the boundary , we can not immediately conclude that the corresponding operator @xmath2 is compact .",
    "in other words , in higher dimensions there is no universal characterization of compactness , and the geometry of the domain plays a decisive role .    as for a more specific example , consider a convex domain in @xmath5 that contains an analytic disc in its boundary . on these domains ,",
    "if @xmath6 is smooth up to the boundary then the hankel operator @xmath7 is compact if and only if @xmath6 is holomorphic along the analytic disc in the boundary , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2 ) .",
    "this result indicates that one needs to investigate the boundary geometry of the underlying domain to understand compact hankel operators .",
    "the @xmath8 theory of the @xmath0-neumann operator is one of the common ways of relating the boundary geometry and compact hankel operators , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for some recent results .",
    "one reason for this connection is the kohn s formula that conveniently links hankel operators and the @xmath0-neumann operator .",
    "another tool in this context is the notion of compactness multipliers , which have been studied with the purpose of characterizing obstructions to compactness of the @xmath0-neumann problem @xcite .",
    "therefore it is natural to relate these multipliers and obstructions for compactness of hankel operators . as a first observation , on a bounded convex domain",

    "therefore , on convex domains any compactness multiplier induces a compact hankel operator . without the convexity assumption ,",

    "can be helpful to examine obstructions for the compactness property of the @xmath0-neumann operator and of hankel operators .",

    "the defining function itself being a compactness multiplier helps us to connect the geometry of the domain with the compactness multiplier notion . because we are working on domains with smooth boundaries ( not necessarily real analytic )",
