    "the transition takes place at a quantum critical point ( qcp ) characterised by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is of the order one . for @xmath13",
    "the effective interactions dominate and magnetic order appears . for @xmath14",
    "the singlet formation dominates and a heavy fermi liquid state is realized .",
    "this qualitative picture has been supported by numerical calculations within dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) and exact diagonalization methods @xcite for the anderson lattice and kondo lattice hamiltonian respectively .",
    "however the vicinity of the quantum critical point and associated nfl behavior @xcite requires a treatment within phenomenological effective models as developed in refs .  .",

    "this model still contains the charge fluctuations of conduction electrons expressed by the hopping term .",
    "it was shown by doniach @xcite that in 1d it may be replaced by an xy - type inter - site exchange term . thus the kondo lattice model is replaced by a pure spin hamiltonian , the kondo - necklace model ( knm ) . in higher dimension",

    "therefore , @xmath112 which simplifies eq.([e120 ] ) to @xmath113 however , the key observation is that all anomalous contributions are suppressed by an additional small parameter present in the theory - the density of the triplet excitation @xmath114 . indeed ,",
    "both terms of the anomalous scattering matrix are proportional to @xmath115 which are neglected . by replacing the noninteracting normal green s function ( eq.([e100 ] ) ) in the bethe - salpeter equation ( eq.([e130 ] ) ) and taking the limit @xmath116 we obtain the scattering matrix in the form ( see appendix a ) @xmath117 now , we can calculate the single particle self - energy ( fig [ fig2 ] ) of bosons by utilizing the two particle self - energy ( @xmath111 ) shown in fig .",

    "this means that @xmath250 and @xmath50 will be slowly varying functions of the control parameter @xmath252 . on the other hand the present green s function approach corresponds to fixing these two parameters to @xmath253 - independent constants given by @xmath51 and @xmath254 which correspond to the mean field values for @xmath255 .",
    "therefore on the level of h@xmath256 there is no constraint implemented in the present approach .",

    ". one might speculate whether it would be an improvement to start from the self - consistent mean field solution for @xmath50 and only then impose the further constraint with the @xmath102-term .",
    "however this can not be justified easily .",
    "once the constraints has been used in mean field level the fluctuations of the mean field singlet and triplet amplitudes should rather be unconstrained .",
    "+ however , the hard core repulsion on bosonic excitations which is imposed by @xmath102 , ensures that only one triplet can be excited on each bond .",
    "it justifies the dominant contribution to the excitation spectrum of the model .",
    "while , in the mean field approach there is no restriction to have more than one triplet excitation on each bond and the constraints @xmath249 should be statisfied only when averaged over all bonds . in other words ,",
    "the green s function approach may be expected to give an improved excitation spectrum .",
    "this is the reason why the critical exponent of the excitation gap obtained by green s function approach is more accurate .",
    "the calculation of critical gap exponents presented here presents a contribution to understanding the quantum critical behavior of the anisotropic kondo necklace model .",
    "an extension to the antiferromagnetic side of the quantum critical point would be desirable to allow for a full comparison with the mean field results in ref .  .",
