    "stellar model calculations show that the detailed structure and evolution of a star of given mass depends on its chemical composition ; so we expect stellar yields as well to be influenced by metallicity . a homogeneous set of metallicity dependent yields , covering the whole stellar mass range , has been derived by the padova group .",
    "detailed results can be found in  @xcite ( hereinafter pcb98 ) for massive and very massive stars and in  @xcite for low and intermediate mass stars . in this paper",
    "we will discuss the yields from massive and very massive stars ; full details can be found in pcb98 .",
    "in the range of massive stars , quiescent mass loss has a strong influence on the yields , because ( 1 ) ejecta are directly released through the stellar wind , and ( 2 ) mass loss affects the final total and core mass and thus also , indirectly , the final supernova ( sn ) .",
    "the efficiency of radiation pressure driven wind scales with metallicity ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , through the mass loss rate metallicity affects the mass and composition of the layers peeled off in the wind , as well as the final stellar mass @xmath3 and co - core mass @xmath4 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "notice how the most massive stars ( @xmath5 ) in the high metallicity sets end up with similar , low final masses ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "these stars go through a wr stage , where mass loss is efficient and strongly mass - dependent ( @xcite ) : their mass decreases rapidly while @xmath7 also decreases correspondingly , until they all reach very similar final masses .",
    "the switch to the wr stage at high masses produces a peak in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which is less and less prominent , and corresponds to lower and lower initial masses , the higher the metallicity ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "for the lowest @xmath0 , the peak mass falls in the range of very massive stars , where this behaviour is qualitatively extended ( sect .",
    "basing on the padova tracks @xcite pcb98 calculated stellar yields of massive stars ( @xmath8 ) with mass loss for 5 sets of different metallicity , from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . the contribution to stellar yields from hydrostatic stages beyond he - burning and from explosive nucleosynthesis of _ iron - core collapse _",
    "sn was estimated by matching our stellar pre - sn models with the sn yields by  @xcite , on the base of the respective co - core mass @xmath4 .    at the high mass end , _ pair creation _ ( pc ) sn  are expected . following  @xcite , depending on the detailed mass the outome may be : partial explosion with ejection of some layers and the rest falling into a black hole ( @xmath11 ) , total thermonuclear explosion ( @xmath12 ) , complete collapse into a black hole ( @xmath13 )",
    "; see also  @xcite . in our stellar models ,",
    "mass loss inhibits the growth of so large cores , and are confined to the most massive stars in the lowest metallicity range ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the adopted sn yields for these pc cases are from  @xcite .",
    "the fractionary stellar yields of massive ( and very massive , see sect .",
    "3 ) stars are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "at low metallicities , remnant masses can be very large due to low mass - loss rates : massive cores are built , leaving large remnants ; and when most of the core mass falls into a black hole , little oxygen is released . for the largest masses ( @xmath14 ) , pc sn  occur and the oxygen yields increase again , while remnant masses decrease .    for metallicities @xmath16 the effects of mass loss",
    "become apparent : for @xmath17 , remnants are much smaller than in the low-@xmath0 sets , while helium and carbon yields increase because of the contribution of the wind .    for heavy elements ( si",
    ", s , ca , fe ) the bulk of contribution generally comes from stars in the range @xmath18 .",
    "a primeval population iii of very massive objects ( vmos ) was invoked in past years as a possible solution for the g - dwarf problem and for the non - zero metallicity of population ii stars , to form black holes which could account for dark matter and agns , to explain the reionization of the universe , to produce primordial helium ; for a review see  @xcite .",
    "various stellar models for vmos were therefore developed in the 80s .",
    "vmos might have formed more easily at the low metallicity of the early epochs , when the initial mass function ( imf ) was probably more top ",
    "heavy ; e.g.  @xcite .",
    "but the interest for vmos is not limited to extremely low-@xmath0 environments : the pistol star with @xmath20 has been discovered in the galactic centre , where @xmath21 @xcite ; and other such objects are known within the local group @xcite .",
    "therefore , for any @xmath0 it is of interest to extend the grid of stellar yields beyond @xmath22 , which we did in qualitative terms ( pcb98 ) .",
    "basing on the above mentioned papers on vmos and on considerations of continuity with our stellar tracks for massive stars , we expect the structure and evolution of vmos to be as follows .",
    "burning lifetime of vmos is @xmath23 , and h  burning takes place in the inner 50% of their initial mass . during h  burning vmos undergo pulsational instability with violent mass loss , maybe as high as @xmath24 , independent on @xmath0 .",
    "their mass therefore falls rapidly ( in @xmath25 ) below @xmath26 ; from then on , they will end the phase of paroxysmal mass loss , enter the normal regime of radiation pressure driven wind and follow roughly the fate of a star of @xmath27 for the corresponding @xmath0 . at very high masses ,",
    "the ( large ! ) h  burning core may be at some point revealed on the surface : the star then becomes a wr of very large mass and thus very large @xmath7 ( see sect .",
    "2 ) , and decreases to a rather small final mass ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the core mass @xmath4 eventually drives the final sn explosion , as assumed for massive stars . in most cases",
    "the outcome is an iron  core collapse sn ; only for very low @xmath0 a few pc sn  are found .",
    "this gross scenario gives us an analytical estimate of the yields of vmos ; for details see pcb98 .",
    "the grid of stellar yields can thus be extended up to @xmath28 for the 5 metallicities ; the results are shown in fig .",
    "2 . for the lowest metallicity , @xmath9 , stars with @xmath29 enter the regime of pc sn  with complete thermonuclear disruption ( @xmath30 ) and large release of oxygen and heavy elements .",
    "if the imf at low metallicities is skewed toward very high masses , these objects might contribute substantially to the very early chemical enrichment of galaxies ( as pointed out also by ) . at even larger masses , mass loss during the large wr stage",
    "reduces the final stellar and core mass to low values , so that the ejecta mainly consist of helium lost through the wind , with little production of metals .      of course",
    ", the gross behaviour of vmos is expected to depend on the efficiency of mass loss , which is basically unknown for the regime of pulsational instability typical of vmos , and for very low @xmath0 in general @xcite .",
    "what if the assumed mass loss rate in the violent phase is decreased , say , from @xmath31 to @xmath32 ? in most cases , such a mass loss rate is still fast enough to reduce the stellar mass below @xmath26 in a short time , and then the overall evolution will remain substantially the same . only for vmos of @xmath33",
    "the scenario will change : losing only @xmath34 during their lifetime , they never become wr stars and result in a final core mass of @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , ending up in a black hole collapse ."
