    "one of the most precise measurements of the strong coupling constant @xmath5 is provided by the decay rate @xmath6 . in the high energy limit",
    "the quark masses may often be neglected . however , for precision measurements it is desirable to include also mass corrections of the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "this is particularly valid if one wants to predict the total cross section for @xmath9 into hadrons in an energy region where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are of comparable magnitude . in the massless limit corrections",
    "up to order @xmath12 are known @xcite .",
    "terms of order @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite are also available at present , providing an acceptable approximation from the high energy region down to intermediate energy values . for the energy region closer to the production threshold terms of higher order in @xmath16",
    "are necessary . in this paper",
    "a systematic approach is presented to compute these terms .",
    "for the moment the vector current correlator only is considered .",
    "the starting point is thereby the polarization function @xmath17 . with the method presented below we are able to evaluate the three - loop terms up to order @xmath0 in an expansion of @xmath17 .",
    "the polarization function @xmath17 is defined through @xmath18 and the physical observable @xmath19 is related to @xmath17 by @xmath20 it is convenient to write @xmath21 and similarly for @xmath19 . the colour factors ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) correspond to the casimir operators of the fundamental and adjoint representations , respectively . for the numerical evaluation we set @xmath24 .",
    "the trace normalization of the fundamental representation is @xmath25 .",
    "the number of light ( massless ) quark flavours is denoted by @xmath26 . in eq .",
    "( [ eqpi2 ] ) @xmath27 is the abelian contribution ( quenched qed ! ) and @xmath28 is the non - abelian part specific for qcd .",
    "there are two fermionic contributions arising from double - bubble diagrams : for @xmath29 the quark in the inner loop is massless , the external massive , whereas for @xmath30 both fermions have the same mass .",
    "the result for @xmath31 is known analytically @xcite and will serve as check .",
    "the case where the external current couples to massless quarks and these via gluons to massive ones is treated in @xcite and will not be addressed here .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ seclmp ] we will describe the procedure which allows the systematic expansion for @xmath17 in analytic form for large external momentum and its implementation in a program . sect .",
    "[ secm12 ] contains the results separated according to the colour factors . in sect .",
    "[ secim ] the imaginary part of @xmath17 is considered and compared to the result of a recent evaluation using semi - analytical methods @xcite .",
    "finally the conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "[ seccon ] .",
    "in this section the basic rules of the large momentum procedure are briefly described and their implementation in programs is considered .    the methods which allow the expansion of feynman diagrams containing either large masses ( hard mass procedure ) or large external momenta ( large momentum procedure ) have been used extensively in the recent past @xcite . at one- and two - loop level",
    "it is in general still possible to perform the diagrammatic expansion `` by hand '' and only evaluate the integrals with algebraic programs .",
    "however , at three loops this is almost impossible , in particular if one is interested in an expansion up to high orders in @xmath16 .",
    "following @xcite the prescriptions for the expansion of an unrenormalized propagator type feynman diagram in its large external momentum read :    1 .",
    "[ presc1 ] generate all subdiagrams of the initial graph such that 1 .",
    "they contain both vertices through which the large momentum enters and leaves the initial graph 2 .",
    "they become one - particle - irreducible when the two vertices are identified .",
    "[ presc2 ] taylor - expand the integrand of these subdiagrams in all small masses and external momenta generated by removing lines from the initial diagram .",
    "[ presc3 ] in the initial diagram , shrink the subdiagram to a point and insert the result obtained from the expansion in [ presc2 ] .",
    "4 .   [ presc4 ] sum over all terms .",
    "the subgraphs from step  [ presc1 ] are denoted _ hard subgraphs _ or simply _ subgraphs _ , the reduced graphs , resulting from step  [ presc3 ] , the _ co - subgraphs_.    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     = 8.cm    = 8.cm    let us discuss separately the high energy and the low energy regions . for all three functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 and values between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) the expansions including terms of order @xmath38 ( or more ) are in perfect agreement with the semi - analytical result .",
    "conversely this provides a completely independent test of the method of @xcite which did rely mainly on low energy information . including more terms in the expansion",
    ", one obtains an improved approximation even in the low energy region .",
    "however , the quality of the `` convergence '' is significantly better for @xmath34 and @xmath33 than for @xmath39 .",
    "two reasons may be responsible for this difference : ( i ) in a high energy expansion it is presumably more difficult to approximate the @xmath40 coulomb singularity in @xmath39 than the mild @xmath41 singularity in @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "( ii ) the function @xmath34 can be approximated in the whole energy region @xmath42 by an increasing number of terms with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "this is evident from the known analytical form of @xmath34 , a consequence of the absence of thresholds above @xmath43 in this piece .",
    "in contrast the functions @xmath39 and @xmath33 exhibit a four particle threshold at @xmath44 .",
    "the high energy expansion is , therefore , not expected to converge to the correct answer in the interval between @xmath43 and @xmath45 . for @xmath33",
    "this feature can be studied in more detail by separating @xmath33 into the gluonic double - bubble terms in the @xmath46 gauge @xcite and a remainder .",
    "this separation is possible both for the semi - analytical result and the expansion ( fig .  [ figxi4 ] ) .",
    "the remainder approaches a constant both for @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for @xmath49",
    "the agreement is perfect .",
    "it extends even up to @xmath50 , a fact which is quite remarkable and surprising .    for @xmath51 the expansion",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "[ rvx.ps ] .",
    "again one observes quick convergence for @xmath52 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "no ( semi-)analytical result is available for the comparison with @xmath51",
    ". however , in the region below the four particle threshold an analytical result is available , based on the calculation of the form factor in @xcite .",
    "the four fermion contribution is expected to be small for energies just above @xmath45 , corresponding to @xmath52 just below @xmath55 .",
    "reasonable agreement between the two approaches is therefore expected in the region around @xmath56 .",
    "this is indeed observed in fig .",
    "[ rfvirt.ps ] .",
    "an algorithm has been described which produces the asymptotic expansion of the three - loop vacuum polarization automatically .",
    "it generates the relevant subdiagrams and assigns the diagrams automatically to the programs mincer and matad which evaluate the resulting massless propagator and massive tadpole integrals .",
    "the output is compared to the quartic terms obtained in @xcite and to the semi - analytical results of @xcite , confirming both these earlier results and the validity of the expansion down to fairly low energy values .",
