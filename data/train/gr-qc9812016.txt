    "0    in this paper we study the interaction of a cosmic string with a ( non - rotating ) black hole .",
    "this problem is interesting for many reasons .",
    "first of all , it is a rare example of gravitational interaction between two extended relativistic objects that allows complete analysis . when a cosmic string comes close to a black hole and is captured by it",
    ", one might expect generation of strong gravitational radiation , which makes the problem potentially interesting for astrophysical applications . besides this",
    ", the study of the interaction of a cosmic string with a black hole has demonstrated some unexpected , physically interesting possibilities , such as the creation of 2d black holes @xcite .    for astrophysically interesting cases , the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the string tension , is small .",
    "for example , for strings formed during a gut phase transition , @xmath3 .",
    "for this reason , in the leading order one can neglect gravitational backreaction effects and consider the string as a test object propagating in a given gravitational background .",
    "the worldsheet of such a string is a minimal surface which gives an extremum to the nambu - goto action @xcite .",
    "stationary configurations of a cosmic string in the field of a rotating charged black hole are described by worldsheets which are tangent to the killing vector generating the time shift .",
    "because of this symmetry , the problem is reduced to finding a geodesic in a three - dimensional space ; the latter can be solved by separation of variables @xcite . in the absence of such a symmetry ,",
    "non - linear partial differential equations describing the string motion in the gravitational field of the black hole do not allow exact solutions . under these conditions",
    "one either needs approximation schemes or numerical solutions . in the present paper we assume that the string is initially far from the non - rotating black hole , straight , and moving with velocity @xmath4 in the direction of the black hole .",
    "the motion of the string is affected by the gravitational field of the black hole .",
    "for a given velocity @xmath4 , the outcome of the interaction depends on the impact parameter @xmath5 .",
    "if the impact parameter is large enough , the string escapes the gravitational attraction of the black hole and is inelastically scattered . for smaller values of @xmath5 the string is captured by the black hole .",
    "the scattering of a cosmic string for very large impact parameters was studied in @xcite .",
    "such a string passes far from the black hole and its motion is modified only slightly . under these conditions one can consider the gravitational interaction as a perturbation and treat it by expanding the solution in powers of the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath6 . the numerical study of string scattering by a black hole was initiated by moss and lonsdale @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite we used numerical calculations to obtain the dependence of the critical capture impact parameter on velocity @xmath4 , and demonstrated that the results of moss and lonsdale do not correctly reproduce the behaviour of the critical impact parameter at high velocities .    in order to obtain more detailed information on the characteristics of scattering and capture of a cosmic string by a black hole we performed further numerical calculations",
    ". in regimes that allow analytical study ,",
    "we compared numerical and analytical results .",
    "the agreement of these results was used as an additional test of our calculations .",
    "we also analysed the role of tension in the string by comparing the relativistic string results with those for a string without pressure ( a so - called `` dust model '' ) .",
    "these results are discussed in the following sections . in section",
    "2 we formulate the scattering problem for the straight string .",

    "it also discusses coil formation for the scattering in this regime .",
    "( we make the distinction here between coils , which are loop - like configurations in a straight string , and the term loop , as found in the literature , which designates closed , bounded string configurations .",

    "the late - time solution is represented by a kink and anti - kink , propagating in opposite directions at the speed of light , and leaving behind them the string in a new `` phase '' .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that each kink has a characteristic width in the external spacetime given by in the expression for the width of the kinks which was absent in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath82      the above results were obtained under the assumption that the string always propagates in the region where the gravitational field remains weak . in what follows ,",
    "we describe results concerning string scattering in the regime where the gravitational field can not be considered weak .",
    "nevertheless , if the string is not captured it eventually emerges from the strong field region and its subsequent evolution is described again by equations ( [ 2.14 ] ) .",
    "the string s late time features are characterized by the amplitude @xmath83 and width @xmath84 of the kinks ; we refer to these two parameters as the _ scattering data_. as will be seen in the following sections , the breakdown of the weak field approximation manifests itself in two ways : the failure of the analytical expressions to correctly reproduce transient shapes , which develop when the string reaches periastron , and discrepancies in the late - time features of the string , namely the scattering data .",
    "0      in order to study the scattering problem under strong - field conditions ( where the weak - field approximation breaks down ) , a numerical solution to the equations of motion must be found . to deal with an infinite cosmic string numerically ,",
    "a finite computational domain is required , so a method of truncating the string to a reasonably short segment is needed .",
    "such a physical truncation imposes special boundary conditions since it is crucial to reproduce the motion of an infinitely long string with sufficient accuracy .",
    "two methods of truncating a string were developed .",
    "the first places a massive particle at each end of the segment of string and requires that the motion of these particles mimic the motion of the portions of the string lying outside the region of interest .",
    "this is accomplished by letting the mass of the end particles go to infinity .",
    "it should be emphasized that truncating the string and adding infinitely heavy particles at its ends is just a technical trick .",
    "it allows one to consider finite strings . in making the size of the string longer and longer",
    ", we finally reach a size where a further increase in the string s length does not affect the solution within the chosen accuracy .",
    "this may be interpreted as saying that the infinitely massive end particles correctly simulate an infinite string provided the length of the truncated string is chosen sufficiently long ( this issue is discussed in reference @xcite ) .",
    "the second method places the truncation points a reasonable distance away from the region of interest , subject to the condition that the end points remain in a weak gravitational field where a perturbative solution to the equations of motion is applicable .",
    "the analytic weak - field solution is used to prescribe the motion of the boundary points of the string .",
    "each method has distinct advantages , and both were used extensively .",
    "further , the solvers were tested against one another and agreement under identical initial conditions served as an additional validation of the numerical schemes .    with the choice of internal metric @xmath85 , the equations of motion have the form @xmath86 the discretization of these equations ( described in detail in reference @xcite ) yields a block - tridiagonal system with which the solution over the entire spatial ( @xmath87 ) grid is obtained by algebraic methods .",
    "the boundary conditions , for which @xmath88 , are imposed by replacing the first and last entries in the block - tridiagonal system by the required expressions .    for infinitely massive end particles at the boundaries",
    "the following equations are substituted into the system , @xmath89 the derivation of this boundary condition is given in reference @xcite . for the perturbative boundary conditions , the weak - field solutions of eqn.([2.14 ] )",
    "are substituted into the system ; the solutions are given in reference @xcite .",
    "the technical details of the numerical work are not important , but a few general comments are in order on the practical aspects imposed by the boundary conditions and initial data .    under both types of boundary conditions ,",
    "the accuracy of the numerical results may be influenced by the length @xmath90 of the string segment , meaning that if a string segment is too short , the motion of the boundary points induces incorrect behaviour .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath90 , the smaller the effect , but the larger the value of @xmath90 , the greater the number of grid points required to adequately resolve the string .",
    "the choice of string length is therefore a compromise between the need to accurately reproduce the behaviour of an infinite string and the need to use computing resources effectively .",
    "we found that the massive - particle boundary conditions required a string length of at least @xmath91 ( @xmath92 , the schwarzschild radius of the black hole ) to give reasonable results , as discussed in reference @xcite , whereas the perturbative boundary conditions required a much shorter string length , @xmath93 , since the weak - field solutions represent the motion of the string boundary points with sufficient accuracy at these distances .",
    "therefore , the perturbative boundary conditions greatly reduce the number of grid points and time steps needed to resolve the motion of the string near the black hole , and hence speed up execution dramatically .",
    "initial data takes the form of a straight string , minkowski solution with the stipulation that the initial position of the string is sufficiently far away from the black hole to minimize the discrepancy between this approximate initial data and the correct initial configuration in schwarzschild spacetime ; the constraint equations are used as a guide .",
    "the constraint equations are also used to check the accuracy of the calculations during the time evolution of the string .",
    "the evaluation of the discretized form of the constraint equations is carried out periodically during the numerical solution .",
    "statistics are computed for the constraints ( average value over the length of the string and standard deviation ) at the current time step and reported to an output file .",
    "monitoring that the constraints are consistent with zero to several significant digits is done by inspecting this file . if the constraints are not satisfactorily maintained , that is if the average value grows unacceptably large or undergoes sudden changes , the numerical solution is restarted with new parameters ( e.g. finer grid , finer step size ) .",
    "the results for the constraint calculation are influenced significantly by the initial position of the string .",
    "a solution for a string placed initially closer to the black hole requires fewer time steps , but generates a poorer result in the constraint calculation .",
    "typically , the constraints were expected to be consistent with zero from four to six significant figures .",
    "tighter tolerances can also be achieved by increasing the number of grid points ( and significantly increasing solution time ) , but for the purposes of this study , the above values were deemed a reasonable compromise between accuracy and speed .",
    "the perturbative solution to the equations of motion of an infinitely long cosmic string is most conveniently carried out in isotropic coordinates , @xmath46 .",
    "numerically , however , the scattering problem is best studied in eddington - finkelstein in - going coordinates since the christoffel symbols in this coordinate system are regular everywhere away from the origin .",
    "the christoffel symbols associated with this coordinate system , along with their derivatives with respect to the spacetime coordinates , were derived and inserted as analytic expressions in the portions of the code dealing with the initialization of the tridiagonal matrices . also , the coded forms of the analytic expressions for the initial data and for the perturbative boundary conditions were converted to eddington - finkelstein coordinates using standard coordinate transformations .",
    "0    in this section , we compare the numerical solutions of string scattering to those of the weak - field approximation at intermediate velocities ( @xmath94 ) for a range of impact parameters .",
    "our basis for comparison is the scattering data .",
    "figure  2 shows sections of the numerical worldsheet of a string with initial velocity @xmath95 and impact parameter @xmath96 . as shown in table  1",
    ", the maximum amplitude and width of the pulses is in good agreement with the weak - field eqns .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     since the weak - field and ultra - relativistic approximations are accurate only for impact parameters greater than @xmath97 , the boundary of the coil formation is expected to shift due to strong field effects . the solid line shown in figure  5 , based on numerical tests to detect coil formation",
    ", indicates that the boundary is shifted towards lower velocities ; the strong field near the black hole tends to enhance coil formation .",
    "the black hole drives the self - intersection process as its gravitational influence draws points on either side of the string towards the @xmath98 plane .",
    "what happens with the cosmic string forming a cusp which starts growing into a closed coil can not be answered in a simplified model we use .",
    "one of the possibility is that after formation a small coil , as the result of the string interconnection @xcite,@xcite the coil creates a loop . in this scenario ,",
    "the black hole driven self - intersection could leave a line of small loops in the wake of the string .",
    "another option is that loops never form .",
    "instead blobs of higgs particles are ejected continuously as the budding loop cuts from the string without fully forming .",
    "this would result in a trail of fastly decaying higgs particles behind this cusp .",
    "0    as we already mentioned , there are two possible outcomes when a cosmic string interacts with a black hole : either the string is scattered , or it is captured by the black hole . for a given initial velocity @xmath4",
    "the outcome depends on the value of the impact parameter @xmath99 . in other words , in the space of initial data @xmath100 there exists a critical line @xmath101 which separates these two different regimes .",
    "we discuss the critical impact parameter for string capture in section  7 .",
    "this section discusses string scattering where the impact parameter is extremely close to the critical impact parameter for capture and the string comes close to the black hole . in a similar situation for test particle scattering , the particle can execute multiple orbits around the black hole before escaping . some similarities with particle scattering are observed , but there are also important differences that shed light on the process of string capture .    figure  8 compares a slice of the string worldsheet through the @xmath102 plane to the motion of a test particle .",
    "a comparison is made of a series of string and particle trajectories with identical velocities ( @xmath103 ) and nearly identical impact parameters .",
    "for the particle trajectories , these range from @xmath104 through @xmath105 .",
    "for the string , the impact parameters are slightly smaller , ranging from @xmath106 through @xmath107 .",
    "the impact parameters at the lower end of each range result in capture , whereas those at the upper end result in scattering .",
    "it is easy to see that , even at ultra - relativistic velocities , tension influences string motion .",
    "although the critical impact parameter for the string is very close to that for a particle , suggesting that tension plays a limited role , the dynamics of the string are , nevertheless , still governed by tension .",
    "this is manifested in the partial winding of the string",
    "while gravity dominates the dynamics , followed by unwinding of the string as a sufficient interval has elapsed for tension to again dominate ; the transition between the two regimes is marked by the cusp - like feature in box b. by comparison , the escaping trajectories of the test particle are far less complicated , showing no folds or cusps .",
    "the detailed motion of the string in the critical regime close to capture is highly sensitive to the initial impact parameter .",
    "figure  8 shows that there are two types of capture trajectories , trajectories such as curve 1 , where the string crosses the horizon directly , and curve 2 , where the string folds back on itself before crossing the horizon .",
    "curve 2 exhibits a coil - like feature , but does not represent a self - intersection since the intersecting points have distinct proper times . escaping trajectories , such as curve 3 , have a folded structure .",
    "there are two critical cases that mark the transition between each of these three generic curves .",
    "the transition between curves of type 1 and type 2 is marked by a structure that develops an increasingly cusp - like shape ( point b in figure  8) as the impact parameter approaches the critical value that marks the transition from type 1 to type 2 curves . in practical terms , this impact parameter is difficult to obtain since it requires a large number of significant digits ( curve 1 and the curve with point b have impact parameters that differ by one part in @xmath108 ) .",
    "the transition between type 2 and type 3 curves is marked by a tangent point , where the string trajectory passes twice through the same point ( point a ) at different times ( again , no self - intersection ) .",
    "furthermore , the transition between type 2 and type 3 curves is associated with the critical impact parameter for capture",
    ".    a full @xmath109 rendering of the worldsheet nearest the black hole can be generated , but it is very difficult to interpret and is therefore not shown here .",
    "it is sufficient to note that complicated folds and twists are generated as points on the string cross and recross while executing their partial orbit of the black hole . at late times , however , these folds and twists have dissipated and all that remains are kinks , as shown in figure  9 .",
    "this figure shows a detailed view near the @xmath98 plane ; the kinks evolve and move outward along the string , exiting at the top and bottom of figure  9 and leaving behind the straight portion visible at @xmath110 .",
    "this figure reinforces the idea that scattering at late times is completely understood in terms of the perturbative solutions .",
    "however , it may take a significant amount of time for the simple kink / anti - kink picture to emerge . in the case",
    "studied here , the distortions due to the close encounter persist until the string is about @xmath111 past the black hole .",
    "the numerical results for moderate @xmath112-factors show that the string worldsheet folds back on itself , with no evidence of multiple windings or glory scattering as would be the case for near - critical scattering of particles .",
    "in fact , it seems as if the transition to a `` direct capture '' trajectory ( like curve 1 in figure  8) always occurs before a full turn is achieved .",
    "the fact that multiple windings are absent is a clear indication that the tension in remote parts of the string eventually asserts itself in all cases accessible to the numerical solver .",
    "the question as to whether the string can complete more than one full turn and `` wrap '' the black hole for larger @xmath112-factors is an open one .",
    "0    since a cosmic string is an extended object under tension , motion of a string near a black hole represents the result of the competing influences of tension and gravity . in order to shed light on the role of tension in the dynamics of the string ,",
    "the motion of the string is compared to the motion of an array of test particles initially configured with the same position and initial velocity as the cosmic string .",
    "to do this , consider a family of n test particles arrayed on a line with initial position @xmath113 and initial velocity @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a position index ( an integer between 1 and n ) that describes the initial location of the test particle on the line .",
    "these particles each satisfy the geodesic equation and constraint , @xmath116 & = & 0\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to show that , in flat spacetime , @xmath117 satisfies these equations and represents a straight dust string moving with velocity @xmath80 where the discrete @xmath118 mimic the @xmath87 coordinate of the cosmic string .",
    "it should be emphasized that in the general case dust string dynamics is quite different from the dynamics of the nambu - goto string .",
    "for example , without tension a small bump on a dust string simply goes away , while a similar bump on the nambu - goto string produces two small bumps which propagate away from one another with the speed of light . nevertheless , we found it instructive to compare the motion of a straight nambu - goto string in the field of a black hole with the motion of a similar dust string since it clearly demonstrates the role of string tension in capture and scattering processes .    in the weak - field and ultra - relativistic cases ,",
    "the role of tension in the string is made apparent by comparing the yz projections of figures  2 and 6 against those of the dust string in figure  10 .",
    "figure 10 shows that a coil always evolves in the dust string worldsheet .",
    "this coil is due to the keplerian nature of the trajectories of each particle on the dust string .",
    "particles lying on one side of the @xmath119 plane are deflected across this plane since their motion is constrained to an orbital plane passing through the black hole . unlike the cosmic string , the y - axis deflection of the dust string is unbounded ( this is not to say that the deflection does not reach an asymptotic angular value )",
    ". close examination of figures  2 , 6 , and 10 reveals that , at the early stages of scattering , the size of the coils in the dust and cosmic strings are virtually identical , reinforcing the idea that tension takes some time to assert itself .",
    "coil formation is a generic feature of the dust string ; this is not the case for the cosmic string , where coil formation is subject to the low - velocity cut - off effect discussed above .    in the strong - field regime ( with @xmath120 ) , a comparison to the dust solution is uninformative since the impact parameter is well below the critical value for particles and the portion of the dust string near the equatorial plane is captured by the black hole .",
    "however , it does reinforce the idea that internal tension plays an important role in the dynamics of the string , helping the string avoid capture for impact parameters well below that of the dust string .",
    "0    in reference @xcite we presented a plot of the critical impact parameter for capture as a function of velocity , the capture curve for cosmic strings . in that paper",
    ", we used the massive - particle boundary conditions exclusively and showed that , for string lengths greater than @xmath121 , the capture curve was definitive for velocities greater than @xmath122 .",
    "we are now in a position to revisit this curve using the perturbative boundary conditions in the improved numerical solver , and to merge the numerical findings with the ultra - low velocity results of @xcite to present a complete capture curve .",
    "the revised capture curve shown in figure  11 validates two claims made in the previous paper .",
    "first , that the capture curve for long strings is indeed definitive ( provided focusing of end points is negligible ) .",
    "this is so because the revised capture curve is identical to that of the @xmath123 string for @xmath124 .",
    "second , that there is indeed a minimum impact parameter at intermediate velocities , which occurs at @xmath125 and has a value of @xmath126 .",
    "however , it is important to note that the new solver is also velocity - limited in that , at sufficiently low velocities , second - order perturbative effects become important and invalidate the first - order solutions used to set the boundary conditions",
    ". nevertheless , analytic results @xcite are available for this velocity range , and the numerical results join smoothly with the analytical result for the critical impact parameter for very low velocities @xmath127 and is shown as a dashed line in figure  11 .",
    "this capture curve also is in a good agreement with a recent result by page @xcite for the critical impact parameter , @xmath128\\,.\\ ] ] this formula reproduces the general shape of the curve shown in figure 11 , without the fine structure that is revealed by the numerical approach .",
    "the error bars in figure  11 are quite small .",
    "this suggests that the capture curve is not a smooth line , but has some fine structure to it ; this is particularly obvious at lower velocities , but this structure is also observed on a smaller scale at higher velocities as well .",
    "this could possibly be explained by the complicated nature of the trajectory of the string for near - critical impact parameters , and its extreme sensitivity to initial data .",
    "however , detailed studies ( carried out subsequent to the drafting of the present paper ) of the capture curve at ultra - relativistic velocities reveal that the structure is damped out to a certain extent by using finer grids , so it is important to note that some ( and perhaps all ) of the `` jitter '' in figure  11 may be numerical in origin .",
    "it should be emphasized that our numerical results demonstrate that in the limit @xmath129 the critical impact parameter reaches the same value , @xmath130 , as the critical impact parameter for capture of ultrarelativistic particles .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the earlier results of moss and lonsdale @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analytical result ( [ n6.1 ] ) also is inconsistent with the results of moss and lonsdale , who quote a low - velocity dependence of @xmath131 obtained from a numerical fit to their capture curve .",
    "0    in this paper , we discussed the gravitational scattering of cosmic strings by schwarzschild black holes .",
    "this paper brought together earlier results for the critical impact parameter for capture , weak - field analytic solutions , and studied the limitations of approximate solutions as a function of velocity and impact parameter by generating numerical solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "earlier findings have been corroborated by these latest results , and numerical , weak - field , and shockwave results are consistent with one another in the regions where they overlap .",
    "the scattering problem was studied in three regimes . in the ultra - relativistic regime",
    ", we showed that strings form coils , provided that the conditions @xmath132 and @xmath133 are satisfied ; this phenomenon cuts off for velocities below @xmath134 .",
    "a detailed comparison of analytic and numerical results showed that the perturbative results break down for @xmath135 ; this is a surprisingly small value and suggests that the weak - field approximation is quite acceptable for all cases except near - critical scattering . where the weak - field approximation breaks down , in the strong - field regime , kinks are produced ( without coils for @xmath136 , with coils for @xmath137 ) , but their amplitude is larger than predicted by approximate solutions .    in the case of near - critical scattering , the string worldsheet evolves highly complicated structures .",
    "a detailed investigation of string motion in this case showed that there are two characteristic trajectories for capture , the first where the string enters directly , the second where the string evolves a small coil before crossing the horizon .",
