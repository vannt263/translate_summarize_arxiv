    "further investigations by haiman & oh 2005 and furlennato et al .",
    "2005 agreed with these estimates . in this letter",

    "currently , the largest lyman-@xmath0  galaxy sample at z=6.5 comes from subaru observations ( taniguchi et al .",
    "2005 ) which reach just about @xmath92 .",
    "going deeper is then expected to yield a higher density of lyman-@xmath0  emitters .",

    "bigger samples ( both at z=6.5 and z=5.7 ) would also improve the estimate of the attenuation factor .",

    "if we could reduce this limit to 1.4 , i.e a transmission factor of 70% , we would conclude that the minimum stromgren sphere radius needed would be 3  for offset velocity of zero , and 2.6  for a velocity offset of 350  ( figure 1 ) .",
    "in that case the taniguchi et al .",
    "2005 data would imply nearly @xmath93 .",

    "the ionized bubbles could certainly be larger .",
    "measurement of the velocity offset between lyman-@xmath0  redshift and systematic velocity of the galaxy will allow us to further refine the stromgren sphere radius ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "currently our estimates come from such measurements on lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , for which the higher the ew of the lyman-@xmath0  line , the smaller the velocity offset ( shapley et al . 2003 ) .",
    "but the overlap between the lbg samples and the lyman-@xmath0  samples is minimal ; only the lbgs with highest ew ( ew @xmath95  ) would even be selected by the lyman-@xmath0  searches using narrow - bands .",
    "so it is plausible that the velocity offsets for the lyman-@xmath0  emitters ( median ew @xmath96 ; ( mr02 , dawson et al .",
    "2004 ) would be even lower .",
    "spectroscopy of large , complete samples would also yield the information on their distribution and clustering in the line - of - sight dimension , which can be used to determine the overlap in the ionized bubble around the galaxies .",
    "then we can go beyond the zeroth order estimate of @xmath97 to learn about the topology of the ionized bubbles and thus determine whether substantial overlap has happened ( rhoads , in prep ) .",
    "pre - overlap phases of reionization can also be detected by heightened correlation between lyman-@xmath0  sources ( furlanetto et al .",
    "if the sources required for ionizing photons are strongly clustered on @xmath98 scales as observed ( malhotra et al .",
    "2005 ) or predicted ( cen 2005 ) , we should see dramatic field - to - field variations in lyman-@xmath0  number density prior to reionization .",
    "these tests only require the detection of statistically useful samples of lyman-@xmath0  emitters and are eminently practical with present technology at optical wavelengths , and their extension to redshifts @xmath99 through near - infrared observations is close at hand .",
