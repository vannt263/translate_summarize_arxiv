    "giant resonances are a general feature of nuclei and their properties give us a handle on the macroscopic and microscopic behavior of nuclear matter . these modes have been extensively studied in stable nuclei over the last 50  years and the recent inception of radioactive ion beam facilities opens the opportunity to extend these investigations to exotic nuclei .",
    "far from stability new modes are expected to appear . in particular , the dipole response of neutron - rich nuclei may exhibit strength at energies lower than the standard giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) often depicted as the oscillation of a deeply bound core against a neutron skin giving rise to a so - called pygmy resonance .",
    "recent studies on oxygen  @xcite and tin  @xcite isotopes have given the first experimental indications for such an effect , while at the same time calling into question its nature .",
    "the theoretical approach is often based on mean field calculations .",
    "relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa ) and quasi - particle rrpa ( qrrpa ) calculations have been carried out by cao and ma in @xmath0ne  @xcite which predict that below 10  mev excitation energy , almost 5% of the thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) energy weighted sum rule is exhausted by strength centered around 8 mev .",
    "this region of energy is located between the one neutron and the two neutron emission thresholds .",
    "thus , in order to investigate this prediction , we performed coulomb excitation of @xmath0ne at intermediate energies on a lead target and used the invariant mass method to reconstruct the b(e1 ) strength from the @xmath0ne@xmath6@xmath3ne@xmath7 reaction .",
    "the experiment was performed at the riken accelerator research facility .",
    "a secondary @xmath0ne beam was produced through fragmentation of a 95  a.mev @xmath2ar  primary beam on a 2-mm - thick @xmath8be target .",
    "the @xmath0ne was separated by the riken projectile fragment separator ( rips )  @xcite .",
    "particle identification was unambiguously performed by means of the time - of - flight ( tof ) and the purity was 80% .",
    "the @xmath0ne beam of intensity @xmath9  pps and incident energy 58  a.mev , was tracked with two parallel - plate avalanche counters providing incident angle and hit position onto the target .",
    "it then impinged alternatively on a 230  mg/@xmath10  @xmath1pb  and a 130  mg/@xmath10  @xmath1al  target .",
    "data obtained with aluminum target are used in the following to estimate the contribution of nuclear excitation to the data .",
    "the outgoing charged fragments were measured using a set of telescopes placed at 1.2  m downstream of the target .",
    "they consisted of two layers ( x and y ) of 500  @xmath11 m silicon strip detectors ( ssd ) with 5  mm strips which provided an total energy resolution of 1.5  mev ( fwhm ) .",
    "the last layer used 3-mm - thick si(li ) from the charged - particle detector must  @xcite , provided a 9  mev ( fwhm ) resolution on the remaining energy ( e ) .",
    "unambiguous mass and charge identification of all projectile like fragments was obtained using the e-@xmath12e method .    in - beam",
    "gamma rays were detected using a 4@xmath13-gamma - detector , dali2  @xcite , which consists of 152 nai detectors placed around the target . for 1.3  mev gamma - rays ,",
    "its measured efficiency is approximately 15% with an energy resolution of 7% ( fwhm ) .",
    "the doppler corrected gamma energy distribution obtained in coincidence with the @xmath3ne isotope allows us to identify the gamma decay from the adopted 1702.7(7 )  kev and 3316.4(11 )  kev excited states .",
    "in addition we observed a @xmath14  kev gamma - ray which we related to the @xmath15  kev excited state , only seen up to now by transfer reaction  @xcite .",
    "the hodoscope for neutron detection was an array of 4 layers of 29 plastic rods each , placed 3.5  m downstream of the target .",
    "each layer was composed of 13 [ 2.1  m@xmath166@xmath166  @xmath10 ] and 16 [ 1.1  m@xmath166@xmath166  @xmath10 ] rods , arranged in a shape of a cross .",
    "its total intrinsic efficiency for the detection of one 60  mev  neutron was calculated to be @xmath18% .",
    "finally 29 thin plastic rods covered the front face of the wall in order to veto charged particles as well as to provide an active beam stopper .",
    "the neutron position is determined with an error of @xmath193  cm and the energy , from tof information , with a 2.5  mev ( fwhm ) resolution for the neutrons of interest .",
    "we have performed a simulation of the experimental setup using the geant  3 package  @xcite . in order to check the reliability of the analysis",
    ", we built the elastic scattering angular distribution of @xmath0ne on @xmath1pb  at 55  a.mev .",
    "it is in good agreement with a dwba calculation based on a @xmath20ne+@xmath21pb at 40  a.mev optical potential from  @xcite .",
    "we empirically generated optical potential parameters for the @xmath0ne+@xmath22al reaction and tested them by comparing with the experimental elastic scattering .    using the invariant mass method ,",
    "the excitation energy of an unbound state in the nucleus @xmath23 decaying to a state in @xmath24 can be expressed by : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the relative energy between neutron and @xmath24 and @xmath27 the one neutron emission threshold .",
    "the gamma detection efficiency was not high enough to apply an event - by event reconstruction technique . to extract the excitation energy spectrum ,",
    "we hence used a method based on adequate subtraction of relative energy spectra built for these two kind of event .",
    "the method can be illustrated in the schematic case where the daughter nucleus @xmath24 has only one excited state below its neutron threshold .",
    "the excitation energy spectrum can be decomposed in the sum of two contributions : the decay of @xmath23 to the ground - state ( gs ) of @xmath24 and the decay of @xmath23 to the excited state ( i ) of @xmath24 .",
    "the first contribution can be obtained by subtracting from the inclusive relative energy spectrum @xmath28 the relative spectrum of gamma - coincidence events @xmath29 divided by the gamma detection efficiency @xmath30 , and shifted `` @xmath31 '' by the one neutron emission threshold @xmath27 _ i.e. _ : @xmath32 .",
    "the second contribution is simply the relative energy spectrum of gamma - coincidence events shifted by the gamma energy : @xmath33 .",
    "finally , the excitation energy spectrum for the @xmath3ne+n decay channel is given by : @xmath34 .",
    "the method was tested by simulation in this schematic case , and also in the realistic case taking into account the experimental decay scheme of @xmath3ne .    *",
    "left : * excitation energy distribution in @xmath0ne in the @xmath1pb  target .",

    "right : * same as previous but for the @xmath1altarget.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the excitation energy spectra reconstructed for the @xmath3ne+n decay channel obtained with the @xmath1pb  and @xmath1al  targets are represented on fig .  [ fig : invmas ] .",
    "note that above @xmath35  mev , the decay of @xmath0ne is expected to occur mainly by 2 neutron emission . between 8 and 10 mev ,",
    "a sizable amount of cross - section is observed for both targets . in intermediate energy inelastic scattering with a heavy target such as @xmath1pb ,",
    "the coulomb dominance of the e1 excitation is well - known .",
    "the contribution of possible e2 excitation to the spectrum obtained with the lead target has  in a first step  been determined using data taken with the aluminum target and the coupled channels ecis  97  @xcite code .",
    "assuming simple collective vibration mode with equal nuclear and coulomb deformation lengths , the e2 deformation parameters were extracted from the measured cross - section with the @xmath1al  target ( @xmath36  mb ) .",
    "the @xmath37 cross section in lead was then calculated using the deformation lengths extracted in the previous step .",
    "we obtained @xmath38  mb .",
    "after subtraction of the @xmath37 contribution , the resulting @xmath39  mb cross section corresponds , using ecis  97 , to a coulomb deformation parameter of @xmath40 which led to a @xmath41  = 1 by 2 @xmath5 _ via _ the relation @xmath42 with @xmath43 the coulomb radius .",
    "this value of reduced transition probability correspond to @xmath44% of the thomas - reiche - kuhn energy weighted sum rule for an excitation energy of 9  mev .",
    "we estimate the error due to the choice of optical potential by performing the same analysis using now parameters from the @xmath2ar+@xmath21pb reaction at 40  a.mev  @xcite .",
    "we obtained @xmath45  = 2 by 2 @xmath5 _ i.e. _ @xmath46% of the trk , in good agreement with the values previously extracted , which demonstrates that we are not strongly sensitive to the choice of the optical potential for the reaction on lead .    due to the high granularity and the good resolution of the present setup , it is possible to reconstruct the scattering angular distribution for @xmath0ne on the @xmath1pb  target which",
    "is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pygmy : angdist : pb ] .",
    "hence , we have used a second method to extract the e1 excitation which relies on a multipole decomposition analysis of this angular distribution .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath48 angular distributions ( dashed and dotted lines ) were obtained from simulation based on ecis  97 angular distribution calculated for @xmath49  mev .",
    "the data were fitted with a linear combination of the two distributions .",
    "the results of the fit give us @xmath4 which corresponds to @xmath50% of the trk , again for an excitation energy of 9  mev .",
    "if we suppose now that the remaining part of the contribution is due to @xmath37 excitation we can extracted a @xmath51 for this structure .",
    "the two results from the two different methods are in agreement but since the multipole decomposition of the angular distribution relies only on the data from lead target , the second value of @xmath52  = 1 by 2 @xmath5 will be retained .",
    "the results obtained from our experiment concerning the e1 transition are compared in the following to theoretical calculations .",
    "in the introduction we already presented results from cao and ma @xcite . using the relativistic qrpa framework and the response function formalism they predicted a pygmy resonance centered around 8.4  mev and which exhausts @xmath53 of the trk , which is close to our experimental values .",
    "another calculation has been performed by khan  _ et  al .",
    "it is based on effective sgii skyrme interactions and is performed in the spherical qrpa framework .",
    "it predicts a redistribution of the strength at low energy centered around @xmath54  mev exhausting @xmath55 of the trk .",
    "two other preliminary calculations has been performed in the deformed qrpa framework using gogny forces  @xcite and in the deformed relativistic qrpa framework  @xcite .",
    "both predict a redistribution of the strength at low energy , centered around @xmath56  mev and @xmath57  mev respectively .",
    "the first calculation also predicts that only @xmath58 of the trk should be exhausted .",
    "preliminary shell - model calculations have also been performed by nowacki__et  al . _ _",
    "@xcite who predict a state at 9.3  mev exhausting @xmath59 of the trk .",
    "all these theories agree on the presence of a @xmath60 structure a low excitation energy , compatible with our experimental result but they disagree on its nature : the amount of strength differs as well as as well as its collective or single particle nature .",
    ".experimental branching ratio compared to statistical model for a given @xmath0ne transition multipolarity to a given excited state in @xmath3ne compared to experiment . [",
    "tab : stat : decay ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our reconstruction method for the excitation energy allows us to extract for the first time data on the decay of pygmy resonance of neutron  rich nuclei .",
    "we present the experimental branching ratios towards the various states of @xmath3ne in tab .  [",
    "tab : stat : decay ] .",
    "the clear difference between the branching ratios obtained with lead and aluminum targets proves that states of different nature have been excited . for comparison",

    "it clearly shows that the decay is not statistical , which is not surprising for a light nucleus .",
    "no predictions of the direct decay of pygmy states yet exist from the previously mentioned microscopic models .",
