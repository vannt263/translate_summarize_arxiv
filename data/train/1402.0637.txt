    "charge pumps based on tunable - barrier semiconductor quantum dots @xcite can implement frequency - locked single - electron transfer with remarkable accuracy @xcite , serving as potential building blocks for a quantum current standard . in a single - parameter non - adiabatic quantized pumping scheme @xcite , the bottleneck for accurate current quantization is the initialization phase of the pumping cycle  @xcite , in which the entrance barrier separating the quantum dot from the source lead is closed , trapping a certain number of electrons electrons @xmath0 on the dot .",
    "these electrons are later ejected with high fidelity into the drain lead , producing a directed current @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is electron charge , @xmath3 is the pumping frequency ( up to the gigahertz range @xcite ) and @xmath4 is the statistical average of the number of trapped electrons .",
    "decay cascade model  @xcite has been successfully employed to describe the @xmath5-@xmath6 characteristics of a non - adiabatic quantized charge pump using a fitting formula @xmath7 where @xmath6 is the dc voltage on the exit barrier gate , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the fitting parameters .",
    "( we focus on the interplay of the first two charge states which limits @xmath0 to @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath13 . ) the value of @xmath10 can be obtained from measurements of relatively low precision , and serves as a convenient figure - of - merit for predicting the ultimate flatness of the current quantization plateaux for a particular device .",
    "there are certain limitations of the decay cascade model which this paper aims to address .",
    "experimentally , deviations of the current quantization steps from the double - exponential shape have been reported in high - precision measurements @xcite .",
    "the original formulation of model  @xcite considers the limit of an extremely rapidly rising energy of the quantum dot , such that @xmath14 is set by the backtunneling dynamics only , and @xmath10 is determined by the ratio of the decay rates @xmath15 for the first two charge states , @xmath16 . in a later publication",
    "@xcite , a more general model of the non - equilibrium charge capture has been put forward which includes also the addition energy @xmath17 and the temperature @xmath18 .",
    "it has been shown that eq .",
    "is reproduced by the general model in the limit of @xmath19 .",
    "however , finite - temperature corrections and the physical parameters controlling them have not been characterized .    in this paper , we show that the empirical figure - of - merit @xmath10 of the decay cascade model includes both temporal and energetic separation between the electrons escaping back to the source : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the plunger - to - barrier ratio @xcite of the entrance barrier gate .",
    "@xmath21 is equal to shift of the energy levels of the quantum dot during the time @xmath22 it takes for the tunneling rate to be reduced @xmath23 times ; it is a measure of cross - talk in the design of the energetic ( `` plunger '' ) and the barrier functions of the gate . at finite temperatures we find that the corrections to eq .",
    "are controlled by the ratio @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "decay cascade formula remains a good approximation for @xmath26 . at higher temperatures the following _ ansatz",
    "_ for the current quantization plateaux ( defined by the range @xmath27 ) describes well the crossover between the backtunneling and the thermal error mechanisms : @xmath28 the ratio @xmath29 extracted from numerical data is close to @xmath24 , as expected from our recent analysis of fluctuations in a model of a single quantum level  @xcite .",
    "we employ the sequential tunneling master equation with time - dependent rates @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 describes addition ( @xmath32 ) or removal ( @xmath33 ) of a single electron to a charge state @xmath0 , and @xmath34 is the non - stationary probability distribution subject to normalization @xmath35 .",
    "transition rates are subject to a ( generalized ) detailed balance condition , @xmath36 , which defines the corresponding time - dependent chemical potentials @xmath37 of the charge state @xmath0 with respect to the grounded potential of the source lead , @xmath38 . the total rate @xmath39 is dominated by the exponential gate - voltage ( and hence , time ) dependence of the tunneling matrix elements due to the field effect in the semiconductor constituting the closing entrance barrier between the source and the quantum dot .",
    "following @xcite we postulate @xmath40 around the first charge state decoupling time @xmath41 .",
    "the second state is separated from the first by constant and positive @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the charge capture counting statistics @xcite is given by the large - time limit of @xmath34 starting from a grand canonical equilibrium at @xmath44 . for @xmath45 the initial condition",
    "gets forgotten due to adiabaticity of stochastic dynamics - with @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "similar to the time - dependent entrance gate voltage which creates the time - dependencies and , a dc voltage @xmath6 on a tuning ( e.g. , exit ) gate is expected to affect energies linearly and tunneling rates exponentially .",
    "both effects result in a linear shift , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the zero - temperature solution reported in @xcite in terms of the parametrization and results in @xmath48 given by eq .   with @xmath10 given by eq .  .",
    "increasing @xmath49 brings about gradual rounding of the steps and increase of the slope at the flattest part of the plateaux , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tup ] .     as function of @xmath6 for a uniform set of temperatures @xmath50 to @xmath12 ( blue to red , decreasing steepness ) .",
    "cascade parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 , voltage rescaling parameters fixed to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "insets show examples of fitting the pure decay cascade formula ( blue , lower curve ) and the fluctuation _ anstaz _",
    "( red , upper curve ) to the numerical solution ( dots).[fig : tup ] ]    the decay cascade model formula gives a better fit than the fluctuation _",
