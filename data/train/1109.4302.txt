    "a notion of the weak value proposed by aharonov et al @xcite has brought a new understanding on the quantum observation , i.e. a weak measurement @xcite which hardly disturbs the quantum state .",
    "the reason of this strange nature of the quantum measurement is that the weak value is defined as an expectation with the condition of two - time observations of the initial and the final states which differ from one another .",
    "this condition is very rare case with little probability and is far from the main behavior of a given quantum system .",
    "then the observation of the weak value does not disturb the quantum system not so fatally . as a result of this rather fictitious probability",
    ", the weak value happens to be abnormally enhanced from its inherent norm .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to make the mechanism of this abnormal behavior clearer by using a classical stochastic model , in which we can avoid the ambiguity of the complex probability in the quantum case @xcite .",
    "we introduce a conventional transformation of the stochastic master equation to a self - adjoint form in the following section .",
    "a good analogy with the quantum mechanics is found by applying this tarnsformation to the two - time conditional probability ( ttcp ) .",
    "this is shown in sec.3 .",
    "an example of the stochastic ising model which shows an abnormal enhancement of the expectations of some quantities with respect to ttcp is given in sec.4 .",
    "in sec.5 we discuss an extention of ttcp to a density matrix form to complete the analogy with the quantum mechanics .",
    "the last section is devoted to brief summary and discussions .",
    "first let us survey the well - known transformation @xcite to a self - adjoint form of the stochastic master equation .    let be a set of stochastic variables described by a time - dependent conditional probability , @xmath0 for @xmath1 , which obeys the following stationary , markoffian master equation , i.e. the chapman - kolmogorov _ forward _ equation , @xmath2 where @xmath3\\delta(\\mibsub{x}-\\mibsub{x ' } ) -w(\\mib{x'}\\to\\mib{x}).\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath4 has an eigenvalue @xmath5 correspondding to the steady state , @xmath6",
    "let us introduce a _ wave function _ related to this forward conditional probability by @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "this function @xmath9 obeys the forward wave equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 for the time being the initial condition @xmath13 in @xmath9 is abbreviated .",
    "the function @xmath14 is an eigenfunction of eq.([forward ] ) for @xmath5 .",
    "the merit of this transformation is that the eigenvalue problem of a given master equation is simplified , if the matrix @xmath11 is symmetric , i.e. @xmath15 this situation is widely expected when the detailed balance codition , i.e. the time - reversal symmetry @xcite , @xmath16 or equivalently , @xmath17 is satisfied . in this case",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are all real , and non - negative , if the steady state is stable .",
    "therefore , @xmath14 is the ground state .",
    "a useful example is the fokker - planck equation for a single , continuous stochastic variable @xmath18 , @xmath19p(x , t),~ { \\cal l}[x]=-\\df{}{x}\\left(f'(x)+\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\df{}{x}\\right),\\ ] ] which describes a one - dimensional brownian motion in a potential @xmath20 with a small diffusion constant @xmath21 . by using its steady state solutions ,",
    "@xmath22~~\\mbox{and}~~ \\phi_0(x)\\propto \\exp\\left [ -f(x)/\\epsilon \\right],\\ ] ] we find the continuous variable version of the above formulations , @xmath23=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\left [ -\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}\\ddf{}{x}+v(x)\\right],~~ v(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ f'(x)^2-\\epsilon f''(x)\\right].\\ ] ] thus the fokker - planck equation is transformed into a self - adjoint form of an imaginary - time schrdinger equation , @xmath24\\psi(x , t),\\ ] ] and its eigenvalue problem results in a familiar one of the quantum mechanics .",
    "figure.1 shows an early application @xcite to the so - called kramers escape problem @xcite .",
    "the stochastic decay rate of the metastable state in a double - well potential @xmath20 is given by the first excited eigenvalue @xmath25 of the corresponding schrdinger potential @xmath26 .",
    "the first excited state is almost degenerated with the ground state for the small diffusion constant @xmath21 .        -0.5",
    "so far the quantum mechanical reformulation merely helps us to simplify the eigenvalue problem of a given master equation .",
    "none of the remarkable quantum mechanical phenomena appears , until we are concerned with the ttcp , @xmath27 by using the markoffian property and the well - known equality of the simplest bayes theorem , @xmath28 repeatedly , the ttcp can be written in the following form with a pair of the wave functions as @xmath29 where the conjugate wave function @xmath30  is related to the so - called  _ posterior _   conditional probability ,  @xmath31 for @xmath32 ,   by @xmath33 and obeys the _ backward _ wave equation , @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the hermite conjugate of @xmath11 , i.e. the transposed matrix in the present case .",
    "the eigensystem is common with the forward equation eq.([forward ] ) , when @xmath11 is hermite , i.e. real and symmetric as has been assumed here .",
    "the denominator in eq.([twotime ] ) is the weight of overlap between the two wave functions defined by an inner product , @xmath36 of course this quantity is real , while the corresponding quantity in the quantum mechanics is complex in general .",
    "let us define the ket- and the bra - vectors by @xmath37 then the wave equations eqs.([forward ] ) and ( [ backward ] ) are rewritten in the quantum mechanical form as @xmath38 henceforth , @xmath11 is called the hamitonian .    by using this pair of the schrdinger equations it is shown that the overlap integral , @xmath39 given by eq.([inner ] ) does not depend on the current time @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 further it can be shown that this overlap integral has the following properties in the two limits ; @xmath42^{-1 } \\delta(\\xf-\\xi ) .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    note that the two - time conditional expectation ( ttce ) of a physical quantity @xmath43 with respect to ttcp defined by @xmath44 has just the analogous form of the weak value in the quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "thus the ttcp is a non - linear quantity composed of a product of a pair of the forward and the backward wave functions , and can not be described by a closed , linear evolution equation .",
    "then it happens that the principle of the probability superposition is violated and the interference of wave functions may occur .",
    "however , its example is omitted here because none of nontrivial phenomenon from this view point has been found , yet .",
    "the reason may be that the wave functions are always real and possitive in the present case .",
    "let us discuss only the weak value in the rest .",
    "an example is a pair of the classical ising spin @xmath45 having an exchange interaction , @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "let us number the stochastic variable @xmath48 in the order , @xmath49 ,  @xmath50 ,  @xmath51 ,  @xmath52 and choose the following transition matrices , @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "evidently this transition matrix @xmath55 satisfies the detailed balance condition , @xmath56 at the steady state , i.e. the thermal equilibrium of a temperature parameter , @xmath57 . with use of the equilibrium distribution function ,",
    "@xmath58 we find the corresponding hermite hamiltonian , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the usual pauli matrices and @xmath62 denotes the two dimensional unit matrix @xmath63 .",
    "this is the hamiltonian of a pair of _ quantum _ ising spins with the exchange interaction in a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of this hamiltonian @xmath11 , @xmath64 , \\\\",
    "\\ket{1}=\\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } } \\left[~\\ket{\\!\\ua\\ua}~-~\\ket{\\!\\da\\da}~ \\right],\\\\ \\ket{2}=\\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } } \\left[~\\ket{\\!\\ua\\da}~-~\\ket{\\!\\da\\ua}~ \\right],\\\\ \\ket{3}=\\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+p^2 ) } } } \\left[~p~\\ket{\\!\\ua\\ua}~ -~\\ket{\\!\\ua\\da}-~\\ket{\\!\\da\\ua}~+~p~\\ket{\\!\\da\\da}~\\right ] , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] can be easily obtained , where @xmath65 , the ground state . here",
    "the familiar notations @xmath66 are used for @xmath45 . note that the first excited state is almost degenerated with the ground state for a small transition probability @xmath67 .    by using this eigensystem",
    "we can calculate the state vectors , @xmath68 and @xmath69 for arbitrary initial and final states in just the same manner of the elementary quantum mechanics except for the fact that the time @xmath40 is imaginary .",
    "an interesting example is the case where the initial and the final states differ from each other , just like the case of the weak value .",
    "for example , let @xmath70 that is , @xmath71 or equivalently , @xmath72 by using the eigenvector expansion we obtain , @xmath73 and @xmath74    the ttcp is shown in figure.2 .",
    "this result itself is very natural and well - expected , all probabilities being always non - negative .",
    "0.3 cm        a strange behavior appears when we use the basis @xmath75 , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath11 instead of the spin states @xmath76 .",
    "we can calculate the probability , i.e. the ttce of the projection operator @xmath77 onto each eigenstate @xmath78 in the same manner .",
    "the result is given by @xmath79 the fictitious negative probability is found in @xmath80 .",
    "of course the completeness of the probability , @xmath81 is satisfied evidently because of eq.([overlap ] ) .    a related unusual behavior to this fact is the abnormal enhancement of some observables .",
    "for example , if we calculate the ttce of a quantity , @xmath82 an abnormal behavior @xmath83 > 1,\\ ] ] is found for sufficiently small @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "an example is shown in figure.3",
    ".    0.5 cm     for @xmath86 and @xmath87.,width=226 ]    -0.5 cm    note that the natural norm of @xmath88 must be less than 1 , because the eigenvalues of @xmath88 are @xmath89 .",
    "when the transition rate is very small , i.e. @xmath90 , we find @xmath91 a plain reason of this singular behavior is that the overlap integral @xmath39 in the denominator may be expected to be very small owing to ( ii ) of eq.([limit0 ] ) , whenever the initial and the final states differ from each other , i.e. @xmath92 .",
    "this means that to reach @xmath93 starting from @xmath94 in a given time occurs scarcely and is far from the main flow of the conditional probability . on the contrary",
    "none of such strange behaviors are found when @xmath95 , e.g. @xmath96 .",
    "the result for the latter case for the same parameters as the upper abnormal case is shown by the lower curve in figure.3 , its maximum being @xmath97 at @xmath98 and minimum @xmath99 at @xmath100 and @xmath85 .    in figure.4 the ttce of another quantity @xmath101",
    "are shown also .",
    "note that @xmath102 is commutative with @xmath11 and a conserved quantity .",
    "then the horizontal axis in this figure shows a parameter of the transition probability , not the time",
    ".    0.5 cm     for @xmath86.,width=226 ]    -0.5 cm",
    "it should be noted that the physical quantities @xmath88 and @xmath102 are _ non - diagonal _ in the spin - state representation and have no corresponding quantities in the classical ising spin system .",
    "they are related to the transition rate of the stochastic ising spin . in order to calculate",
    "the expectations of such non - diagonal quantities we need an extension of the ttcp to the two - time conditional ( ttc ) density matrix defined by @xmath103 from the definition eq.([inner ] ) of the overlap integral @xmath39 , it is evident that @xmath104 it should be noted , however , that diagonal elements of this density matrix are not always positive as is shown by eq.([projection ] ) in sec.4 , when it is diagonalized by using the basis @xmath105 , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "with use of this density matrix the definition eq.([ttce ] ) of the ttce is extended as @xmath106 this definition of the ttce results in the classical one , if @xmath43 is diagonal .",
    "the notion of this density matrix has not been used in the conventional classical stochastic process .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that this quantity is within a scope of the classical stochastic process itself , because the wave functions , @xmath9 and @xmath30 in eq.([density ] ) are related to the forward and the posterior , classical conditional probabilities , respectively .",
    "in addition , we have an alternative expression for @xmath30 , @xmath107 or equivalently , @xmath108 for @xmath109 due to the time - reversal symmetry corresponding to the detailed balance . then the density matrix eq.([density ] ) can be written as @xmath110 this fact means that we can define the ttc density matrix with only a pair of the usual , forward conditional probabilities for two individual initial states , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "except for the facts that the time is imaginary and the wave function is always real and positive , the classical stochastic process can be described in an analogous form of the quantum mechanics , if we use the ttcp .",
    "for example , the abnormal behaviors of the weak value in the quantum mechanics are emulated .",
    "note that the ttcp and the weak value are always real in the present classical case .",
    "therefore , the origin of such abnormal behaviors is clearer than the quantum mechanical case where complex quantities appear .",
    "in addition , if we have not the explicit solution of the eigenvalue problem , we may calculate the weak value at least with use of the monte - carlo simulation which is often used to investigate the stochastic model .",
    "the importance of the weak value in the quantum mechanics is that it is related to the new notion of the weak measurement without disturbing the quantumu state .",
    "an analogous notion of the latter in the classical stochastic process has not been found yet .",
