    "in introductory and graduate astronomy textbooks alike , the milky way is used as an introduction to galaxies in general ; clearly galactic astronomy and the astronomy of galaxies has evolved together .",
    "most recently , the study of evolution and morphology at high redshift , e.g. motivated by studies of the hubble deep field and the medium deep survey are leading to revisions of the standard paradigms for galaxy morphology and evolution .",
    "ironically , it appears that one legacy of the hst may be abandonment ( at least in part ) of the hubble galaxy classifications ( e.g. conselice et al .",
    "2000 ) .    at the same time",
    ", computational technology is nearly keeping up with observational technology .",
    "computation allows complex non - linear prediction through simulations and statistical inference on large data sets .",
    "the scientific questions remain familiar :    * where does structure in galaxies come from ? * what excites star formation ? * where is the mass in a galaxy ? * what is its role in causing the observed structure ?",
    "what is increasingly clear is that any individual galaxy is morphologically variable .",
    "for example , lopsided ( @xmath0 ) asymmetries are transient ( with gigayear timescales ) , bars may grow slowly or suddenly and , under some circumstances may decay as well .",
    "recent work shows that stellar populations , star formation rates and color depend on asymmetry ( e.g. rudnick , rix & kennicut 2000 ) . because the properties of a galaxy depend on its history ,",
    "an understanding of galaxy evolution requires that we explore the possible scenarios and underlying mechanisms .",
    "this same goal motivated the dynamicists of the past several decades and led to our current understanding of density waves , instability and stability criteria .",
    "unfortunately , gravitational dynamics is also conspiring against our investigation of long - term evolution as i will describe . in short",
    ", a galaxy responds to a wide variety of stimuli and over many gigayears the historical record of specific events fades away . because state - of - the - art and planned surveys will allow us to study the global structure milky way in detail , our galaxy will be key to this understanding .",
    "the overall plan of this talk is a follows .",
    "i will begin with a cartoon review of galaxy dynamics , emphasizing asymmetries , since it is through asymmetries that a galaxy evolves .",
    "i will illustrate this with a review of asymmetries in the milky way .",
    "we will see that the role of satellites and dwarfs may be significant .",
    "finally , i will briefly list the role of upcoming missions and surveys .",
    "fundamentally , all asymmetric structure in stellar systems is transient .",
    "although early work in galactic structure emphasized modes , this same work showed that these modes were different than the familiar discrete modes of plucked strings and drumheads .",
    "systems with very large numbers of degrees of freedom have continuum modes , in addition the more familiar discrete modes , which allow for both global redistribution and dissipation .",
    "a physicist might say : `` spiral arms and bars are a galaxy s way of attempting to reach its minimum energy state . ''",
    "the dynamicist might say : `` any feature with non - zero pattern speed must damp through resonance with the stellar orbits . ''",
    "either way , the end result is transient features which change the morphology of a galaxy .",
    "let me give you three familiar examples and one similar but less familiar case .",
    "swing amplification , a widely used dynamical model for understanding the structure and ubiquity of arms , contains all of these elements .",
    "the following cartoon ( based on toomre 1980 and binney & tremaine 1987 ) of this mechanism first described by goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1965 ) illustrates the basic mechanisms .",
    "= 3.5 in    if one takes a small patch out of a galactic disk , it will look like the situation in the first frame in figure [ fig : swing ] .",
    "the lsrs of orbits appear to lead ( trail ) as one looks inward ( outward ) from the center of the galaxy .",
    "the epicyclic motion about the lsr of an individual orbit is shown .",
    "now assume that a leading material arm appears ( 2nd frame ) .",
    "we follow an individual star ( filled dot ) as this distribution evolves .",
    "the material arm shears out ( successive frames ) but the star feels the excess gravitational attraction of the arm as it shears , amplifying the arm .    a nice simulation of this",
    "has recently been reported by ( demleitner 1998 ) for both stars and gas together .",
    "the imposed leading distortion `` swings '' quickly and amplitude of the trailing arm increases and then damps away .",
    "swing amplification is a simple example of transient behavior induced by a gravitational perturbation . in the end ,",
    "a quiet isolated galaxy may attain a new local axisymmetric state but with a slightly different equilibrium state since the arm has transferred angular momentum from some stars to others .",
    "the shape of the resulting arm depends more on the underlying dynamics of the disk ( e.g. oort constants ) than the details of the triggering distortion .",
    "dynamicists argue whether bars form suddenly , as in the sort of instability that led ostriker & peebles ( 1972 ) to advocate a dark halo , or slowly over many rotation times ( pasha & polyachenko 1993 ) .",
    "either way , the mechanism has a similar explanation .",
    "= 2.6 in    a general orbit in an axisymmetric disk is a rosette .",
    "however , by accelerating an observer around the disk at a particular angular velocity , the orbit can be made to nearly close ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bar ] ) . averaged over time",
    ", the orbit appears to hang out at its outer turning points .",
    "you might imagine , therefore , replacing the orbit s average mass density by a dumbbell ( final panel ) .",
    "now imagine two such orbits .",
    "if this was a cavendish experiment , the ends of the dumbbells would attract . however , recall that these are _ real _ orbits and we are observing them in a rotating frame . depending on the background potential , the material torque can cause the two orbits to precess toward either each other or away from each other .",
    "lynden - bell & kalnajs ( 1972 ) give a precise criteria for this but the general rule is that orbits precess toward ( away from ) each if the rotation curve is rising ( flat ) .",
    "as the process continues , the gravitational potential from the pile of apoapses increases the influence or _",
    "reach _ of the torque and more orbits can be influenced to join the crowd .",
    "this is clearly the description of an instability and it leads to the formation of an @xmath1 bar .",
    "thinking like a physicist again , it is favorable for the bar to exist because the particles that take part lower the energy of their configuration .",
    "in this way , bar formation may be understood by analogy with self - gravitating fluid bodies ( e.g. chandrasekhar 1969 ) . in the presence of a bit of dissipation",
    ", a rapidly rotating spheroid will adopt a prolate shape because it can do so by lowering its energy .",
    "similarly , energy ( and angular momentum ) is redistributed by the formation of a bar .",
    "again , the location and structure of the bar has more to do with the galactic potential and disk distribution than the perturbation which started off the instability .",
    "once the bar has formed , it may continue to influence the evolution of a galaxy ; the existence of a strong non - axisymmetric structure can continue advect angular momentum both to the disk and halo , acting as an angular momentum antenna ( see debattista & sellwood 1998 for a recent discussion ) . in summary",
    ", the existence of a bar implies a process of continuing evolution .",
    "now , a gravitational halo itself can sustain modes , and not unlike those of a disk , these modes damp .",
    "these are less well - known because they are not practical to observe ( however , see the end of this talk ) but can be worked out and detected in n - body simulations .",
    "a halo dominates the outer galaxy and is significant in the inner galaxy and therefore persistent halo distortions can be quite important even though these can not be observed directly .",
    "the strongest of these halo modes is an @xmath0 or sloshing mode and damps surprisingly slowly .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig : halodamp ] for a king model for clarity .",
    "these modes exist for all typical halo models ( e.g. hernquist models [ hernquist 1990 ] , nfw profiles [ navarro , frenk & white 1997 ] ) and do not depend on the existence of a core .",
    "a qualitative explanation for the slowing damping is as follows .",
    "a coherent mode damps through resonances between its pattern speed , @xmath2 and the orbital frequencies , @xmath3 and @xmath4 of individual stars . at @xmath5 order , the damping is a resonance between these frequencies of the form : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for",
    "vanishingly small @xmath2 , the only orbits near resonance are keplerian and therefore at outer edge of the galaxy . if the system can have a discrete @xmath5 mode at small pattern speed , the resonant orbits that can cause damping will be at large radii and the damping will be small .",
    "this is exactly what happens .    in the inner galaxy ,",
    "many studies suggest or assume that the disk dominates the gravitational potential . perhaps this reduces or eliminates the @xmath0 halo mode ? not so !",
    "the disk and halo can have a mutual weakly damped @xmath0 mode .",
    "the quadrupole mode is a weakly amplified by self - gravity but most others appear to damp quickly .",
    "the @xmath0 mode is very easy to excite .",
    "because the halo may contain most of the mass of the entire galaxy , a relatively small halo disturbance can result in a large perturbation of the disk .",
    "for example , the poisson noise from a halo of @xmath9 black holes can produce a mode with potentially observable consequences .",
    "an orbiting satellite or shot noise caused by accreting massive hvcs and dwarfs can all potentially excite the @xmath0 mode .",
    "finally , we tend to think of a galaxy as in equilibrium , however the orbits in the outer halo have very long periods ( several gyr ) ; therefore phase mixing is another source of noise ( tremaine 1993 ) .",
    "although i have emphasized the @xmath5 sloshing modes , there are also @xmath10 bar - like modes .",
    "these quadrupole responses have a shorter damping time then the sloshing mode and this can be understood by the same sort of argument : for a non - zero @xmath2 there are more and closer stellar orbits with resonances of the form @xmath11 .",
    "higher order halo modes damp more quickly .    why havent these modes been seen in n - body simulations ?",
    "there are two answers to this question .",
    "first , they have been or at least their effects have been .",
    "weakly damped modes will be excited by poisson fluctuations and provide excess power at their natural scales .",
    "analyses of n - body simulations show that this excess power is there exactly at the location and amplitude predicted by the dynamical theory . secondly",
    ", detecting the pattern itself is much harder because the pattern speed is slow and the noise in most n - body simulations is sufficient to wipe out the mode in a few crossing times .",
    "this is too short a time for the mode to set itself .",
    "a sufficiently quiet simulation requires many millions of particles .",
    "as an example of the excess power , figure [ fig : densfluct ] shows the effect of the modes on the response to particle ( poisson ) noise .",
    "the left - hand ( right - hand ) panel shows the overdensity for @xmath5 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the overdensity pattern is dominated by the mode .",
    "the @xmath10 profile is an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath5 , and both exceed that expected by poisson fluctuations alone .",
    "higher order harmonics are consistent with the expected poisson amplitudes ( see weinberg 1998a for additional details ) .",
    "this illustrates a general feature of halo dynamics : the response to a transient disturbance will be dominated by the weakly damped modes , independent of the details of the disturbance .",
    "warps in the outer galaxy reveal some combination of the halo and disk properties , the galactic environment and history .",
    "this promise of disk warping as a probe of the gravitational potential has lead to numerous theoretical and observation campaigns ( see binney 1992 for a review ) . whether forced by an external perturbation such as a dwarf galaxy , accreted material or a rotating triaxial halo , warping and bending of the disk",
    "may be considered as a response .",
    "just as in the case of the halo , these features will be generic .",
    "a good toy model is a slab of stars of infinite horizontal extent but finite vertical extent .",
    "the limiting case , an infinitesimally thin stellar slab can sustain bending modes . in general , both bending and breathing modes exist ( see cartoon in fig . [ fig : bending ] ) . as one thickens the slab ,",
    "these bending modes begin to damp ( weinberg 1994 ) . the damping results from a coupling between the bending and the vertical degrees of freedom in orbits making up the disk .",
    "if you perturb an slab with projectile , it will begin bend .",
    "however , the thicker the slab ( ratio of vertical to in - plane velocity dispersion ) , the faster the damping .",
    "the generalization of this simple slab to an thin axisymmetric disk is due to hunter & toomre ( 1969 ) and since has been invoked to explain disk warps ( e.g sparke & casertano 1988 , hofner & sparke 1994 ) .",
    "more generally , a warp may be a player in a much larger nested set of distortions .",
    "for example , weinberg ( 1998b ) suggests the possibility of a warp created by a distortion from the orbiting lmc .",
    "the lmc first excites a wake in the halo .",
    "the halo distortion will be similar in shape to those depicted in figures [ fig : halodamp ] and [ fig : densfluct ] .",
    "but because the lmc orbital plane is highly inclined this wake can differentially distort the disk plane and the disk response is a warp ( more on this in  [ sec : lmc ] ) .",
    "this final topic points out that all of these distortions may be simultaneous and connected , and at the very least , a disturbance in the halo or disk should not be considered independently .",
    "threaded through the dynamical overview is the importance of the underlying galactic structure in forming a response , independent of the excitation .",
    "before we put the whole picture together , let us take stock of the milky way asymmetries .",
    "the milky way shows evidence for every type of asymmetry described above :    1 .",
    "the milky way has a bar .",
    "this has been demonstrated in many tracers : surface brightness ( cobe ) , star counts , gas and stellar kinematics and , as originally postulated by de vaucouleurs , based on morphology ( de vaucouleurs & pence 1978 ) .",
    "recent work by englmaier , gerhard and collaborators shows this quite convincingly ( e.g. englmaier & gerhard 1999 ) .",
    "the milky way is lopsided .",
    "in fact , it is lopsided both in the inner kpc and the outer 30 kpc ! the former asymmetry",
    "is clearly seen the molecular gas ( e.g. blitz et al . 1993 ) and the latter is evident in the hi analysis presented by henderson et al . 1984 . 3 .   the milky way is most certainly warped .",
    "this is also clearly seen in the hi layer ( henderson et al .",
    "the line of nodes is roughly @xmath12 .",
    "the hi layer reaches nearly 3 kpc above the plane at edge of the stellar disk ( @xmath13 kpc ) and this is echoed in the molecular gas layer ( heyer et al .",
    "there is a evidence for a stellar warp as well ( djorgovky & sosin 1989 , carney & seitzer 1993 ) but recent analysis based on hipparcos data ( smart et al .",
    "1998 , drimmel et al . 1999 ) show that some mysteries remain .",
    "the shape of the halo is less certain .",
    "recent results claim both flattened and round .",
    "two arguments for a flattened halo have been recently presented by olling & merrifield 2000 .",
    "the first is based on the milky way rotation curve and the local stellar kinematics .",
    "the second assumes that the hi is in hydrostatic equilibrium and uses the magnitude of gas - layer flare to estimate the vertical force and therefore the halo shape .",
    "both methods yield a ratio the short to long axis of @xmath14 . a recent preprint by ibata et al .",
    "2000 argue that @xmath15 based on the nearly great - circle appearance of carbon stars attributed to the sgr a dwarf debris trail .",
    "any significant deviation from spherical would cause the stream to precess and produce smearing which is not seen .",
    "l|l all galaxies & milky way + 72% barred ( weak and strong in h - band ) & barred ( sab ) , 4-arm spiral + 1.4 major satellites / spiral galaxy & magellanic clouds , + + @xmath16 warped & warped + @xmath17 optical , @xmath16 hi lop - sided & lopsided center , outer hi + nearly all galaxies have halos ( inferred ) & 10:1 +          most important , i believe , will be prediction of detailed photometric and kinematic signatures .",
    "such a joint inference has been quite important in the last 510 years in establishing the existence of the milky way bar .",
    "in addition to direct radial velocity campaigns , astrometry promises to revolutionize the study of galactic kinematics .",
    "a number of major astrometric missions are in progress or being planned .",
    "the wakes described in the sections above must induce mean flows and we can use n - body simulations of satellite  halo interaction to investigate globally correlated kinematic signatures .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : nbodykine ] shows the deviations from the average tangential velocity for a disk perturbed by a perturber with a mass equal to twice the lmc mass during a fly - by with pericenter at 70 kpc ( vesperini & weinberg 2000b ) .",
    "we used twice the lmc mass to increase the signal to noise but expect linear scaling with perturber mass .",
    "the plot shows the kinematic distortions after the pericenter passage when the perturber is about 200 kpc away from the center of the primary galaxy .",
    "the interaction produces mean velocity peaks of 30 km / s in a clear dipole pattern .",
    "similarly , because stars do populate the halo regardless of their origin , we can use halo stars to trace wakes directly .",
    "we expect the lmc to produce flows a factor of two smaller .",
    "it should be possible to see such a signature at galactrocentric radii of 16 kpc with 20@xmath18as precision astrometry ( one year baseline ) .",
    "this would requires a directed l.o.s .",
    "attack with sim or the full - survey capabilities of gaia .",
    "i thank enrico vesperini and mike skrutskie for comments on and help preparing this manuscript .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf ast-9529328 .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation ."
