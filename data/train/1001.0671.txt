    "in recent years the flux - flow ( ff ) dynamics in a long josephson junction has attracted considerable attention in view of possible applications in superconducting mm - wave electronics @xcite .",
    "the ff mode appears in a junction immersed in a sufficiently large external magnetic field and can be described briefly as a unidirectional viscous flow of a dense train of fluxons ( magnetic flux quanta ) .",
    "recently , the ff oscillators have found various applications , e.g. in mm - wave integrated receivers @xcite , however some important parameters , such as the radiation line - width are still not satisfactory .",
    "therefore , there is still a need for more adequate description of a real josephson junction operating in the ff mode , by taking into account some additional factors which may affect the current - voltage ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) characteristic of the junction and change its working conditions .    in the majority of papers dealing with long josephson junctions",
    "( see e.g. refs .  ) a simplified version of the the sine - gordon ( sg ) equation is considered , usually neglecting surface losses and assuming uniform distribution of the bias current density .",
    "only recently , a few papers have been published @xcite taking into account a nonuniform bias current distribution and its influence on the junction behavior . moreover , in refs .   a realistic model of the ff oscillator has been investigated both experimentally and numerically , including general boundary conditions , nonuniform bias current profile , surface losses as well as self - pumping effects @xcite related to additional tunneling of quasiparticles due to the josephson radiation .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present an analytical approach to the modified sg equation , which takes into account:(i ) nonuniform current distribution , ( ii ) surface losses , and ( iii ) spatial modulation of the loss factor resulting from the self - pumping effect .",
    "contrary to ref .",
    "we assume standard open - circuit boundary conditions to make the influence of various effects more pronounced .",
    "nevertheless , the present analysis can be easily extended to include also more general boundary conditions .    in the particular case of uniform current distribution ,",
    "the present method makes it possible to obtain fully analytical closed - form expressions describing both the superconducting phase within the junction and the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic .",
    "such a solution can be regarded as the first - order approximation which appears sufficiently accurate for some moderate junction parameters . however , in the general case , particularly for very long and weakly damped junctions , such an analytical approximation is only the first step in an iterative procedure , which has to be performed numerically .",
    "thus , in spite of analytical expressions describing the superconducting phase within the junction , the present approach has been named `` semi - analytical '' .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the problem , i.e. we present a generalized sg equation subject to open - circuit boundary conditions at the junction ends .",
    "approximate analytical solutions to the sg equation are discussed in sec .",
    "we start with a linearized ( small - amplitude ) solution and apply appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "next , some large - amplitude corrections are introduced , we discuss also possible self - pumping effects and their influence on the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic . in sec .",
    "iv analytical results are compared with direct numerical simulations . in particular ,",
    "we discuss the influence of surface losses both for junctions of moderate length and for more realistic structures , such as very long junctions with small damping and strongly nonuniform current distribution .",
    "v contains concluding remarks , we indicate also possible extensions of the method by taking into account more general boundary conditions .",
    "fluxon dynamics in a long josephson junction is usually described by the following modified sg equation @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 denote the quantum phase difference across the barrier , @xmath4 is the loss factor , and @xmath5 is the bias current density .",
    "the spatial coordinate @xmath6 has been normalized to the josephson penetration depth @xmath7 and the time coordinate @xmath8 to the inverse plasma frequency @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the critical current density and @xmath13 denotes the junction capacitance per unit area .",
    "however , to describe more adequately a real physical situation , one can consider a more general form @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the surface loss parameter and we assume both @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be @xmath6-dependent , taking into account both a spatial modulation of the loss factor due to the self - pumping and a nonuniform distribution of the current density along the junction .    for the overlap geometry one can neglect the self - fields and assume simple open - circuit boundary conditions @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17",
    ", @xmath18 denotes the external magnetic field , and @xmath19 is the normalized junction length .",
    "following refs .",
    "we look for an approximate solution in a form of a dense fluxon train traveling on a rotating background .",
    "thus , a linearized solution of eq .",
    "( [ sg2 ] ) can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the background term ( linear in time ) and @xmath22 denotes a quasi - linear term ( usually small ) representing the motion of fluxons and plasma waves within the junction .    substituting eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ sg2 ] ) we find @xmath23    we are interested in a steady - state , time periodic solution , thus the background frequency @xmath24 should be equal to the fundamental frequency of the oscillating term @xmath22 . both experimental data and numerical simulations show that the output signal of a real ff oscillator is nearly sinusoidal @xcite .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume the time - dependence of the term @xmath22 to be harmonic in @xmath25 , and neglect any higher harmonics generated by the nonlinear term @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) can be split into a time - independent part and a part oscillating with frequency @xmath24 , while the boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) can be written separately for @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 @xmath30",
    "the method for solving eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ bc2 ] ) and ( [ bc3 ] ) is similar to that reported recently ( see ref . for details ) .",
    "thus , below we discuss briefly only the main points of the analysis .      it can be easily shown that for @xmath22 oscillating with frequency @xmath24 , the nonlinear term @xmath26 contributes also to the time - independent part of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , and such a contribution yields , in fact , the first - order approximation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic of the junction .",
    "thus , the time - independent equation can be written as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "one can see that the total current density @xmath38 consists of a linear ( ohmic ) part and a nonlinear contribution related to the josephson current .      for @xmath22 sufficiently small we can write @xmath42    noting that the term @xmath43 gives no contribution of frequency @xmath24 and collecting all the time - dependent terms in eq .",

    "analytical approximations are continuous and consist of a series of resonances while numerical results show typical hysteretic behavior and we observe only the segments of positive slope .",
    "it is clear that the presence of even very small surface losses changes significantly the @xmath0-@xmath1 dependence .",
    "generally , the steps ( resonances ) become smaller and this effect is more pronounced for larger values of the external field @xmath63 .",
    "such a result can be easily explained if we recall that the main ff step and accompanying fiske steps are visible in the region @xmath113 and the surface loss factor enters the formalism via @xmath48 . in other words , for higher external magnetic field the influence of surface losses is stronger and the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic becomes more smooth",
    ". the influence of surface losses is clearly visible in experimental results @xcite , where the fiske steps gradually disappear as the external magnetic field is getting stronger .    comparing analytical and numerical results shown in figs .  1 and 2 one can see that the fully analytical solution ( dashed line ) is fairly accurate . on the other hand , the self - consistent solution ( solid line ) reproduces very accurately all the details of the numerical solution .",
    "as the next example , let us consider a more realistic case of a very long junction with small damping .",

    "we choose @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and a slightly asymmetric current profile @xmath118 depicted in fig .",

    "second , it appears ( even for a uniform current profile ) that the first - order approximation is not accurate enough for very long junctions , and consecutive iterations are necessary to obtain a self - consistent solution .     and",

    "open circles correspond to numerical simulations while the solid line represents a self - consistent solution .",
    "one can see that the agreement between numerical and analytical results is rather poor for @xmath125 . to explain this discrepancy we should recall the main assumption ( see sec .",
    "ii ) that eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) can be separated into a time - independent part and a part sinusoidal in @xmath25 while neglecting higher - order harmonics .",
    "the fourier analysis shows , however , that the anharmonic contribution to @xmath126 is rather large for @xmath125 .",
    "e.g. for @xmath127 we find the content of the second harmonic to be about 35% .",
    "physically , it means that the fluxon train is not sufficiently dense for @xmath125 and its time - dependence although periodic is not strictly sinusoidal .",
    "contrary to the case @xmath125 , for @xmath124 we observe excellent agreement between numerical and analytical data .",
    "now the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic is smooth and the fiske steps disappeared completely as a combined result of surface losses and self - pumping effects .",
    "the fourier analysis of @xmath126 shows now that the anharmonicity diminishes rather quickly with increasing @xmath63 and for @xmath124 we observe only about 10% of the second harmonic .",
    "another interesting feature which is visible for @xmath124 is an additional small step at @xmath128 .",
    "such a step appears in experimental results @xcite and can be attributed to the self - pumping effect described in subsection iii.e .",
    "as shown in ref . , the position of the current step follows from a simple relation @xmath129 , where @xmath99 denotes the gap voltage . assuming typical junction parameters @xcite we find a normalized dimensionless gap voltage @xmath130 , hence @xmath128 .",

    "the junction parameters are assumed as before .",
    "i.e. @xmath115 , @xmath124 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "now the dotted lines correspond to numerical simulations and the solid lines denote self - consistent ( analytical ) solutions .",
    "one can see that the agreement is excellent , the self - consistent solution following closely all the details of the numerical simulations , taken here as a reference .",
    "it is clear that @xmath140 generally grows with increasing value of @xmath38 .",
    "e.g. for @xmath127 we obtain an averaged value of @xmath107 about three times larger than the `` unpumped '' value @xmath39 . such an effect together with surface losses makes the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve smooth , damping effectively the fiske steps .",
    "in this paper a semi - analytical approach has been suggested , making possible to solve a modified sg equation ( [ sg2 ] ) with both surface losses and self - pumping effects taken into account .",

    ", practical ff oscillators are based on very long junctions with strongly nonuniform current profile . in such a case",
    "an analytical approximation ( [ iv1 ] ) appears insufficient and one should look for a self - consistent solution of eqs .",

    "the only exception , where one can observe qualitative rather than quantitative agreement is the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve shown in fig .  4 for @xmath125 .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the fluxon train is not dense enough for @xmath125 and consequently the time - dependent part of the solution is periodic but not strictly sinusoidal , violating the main assumption of the present approach .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that the method presented here can be easily extended to include general , more realistic boundary conditions discussed in refs . .",
    "in the present paper , however , we intentionally assumed standard open - circuit boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) , where the plasma waves could interfere after complete reflection at the boundaries , giving rise to clearly visible fiske steps .",
    "this way , we were able to separate the influence of surface losses and self - pumping from that of boundary conditions , which ( e.g. for a resistive load ) can also affect the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic and make the physical mechanism discussed here less clear .",

    "<S> the flux - flow dynamics in a long josephson junction is studied both analytically and numerically . a realistic model of the junction </S>",
    "<S> is considered by taking into account a nonuniform current distribution , surface losses and self - pumping effects . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate analytical solution of the modified sine - gordon equation is derived in the form of a unidirectional dense fluxon train accompanied by two oppositely directed plasma waves . </S>",
    "<S> next , some macroscopic time - averaged quantities are calculated making possible to evaluate the current - voltage characteristic of the junction . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained by the present method are compared with direct numerical simulations both for the current - voltage characteristics and for the loss factor modulated spatially due to the self - pumping . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison shows very good agreement for typical junction parameters but indicates also some limitations of the method . </S>"
