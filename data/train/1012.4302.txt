    "one of the seminal findings triggering the development of quantum information theory is that there exist nonlocal correlations among subparts of quantum systems that do not emerge in a classical scenario .",
    "these nonclassical correlations , commonly identified with entanglement , can be exploited to manipulate and transmit information in novel and enhanced ways @xcite going beyond the possibilities of classical physics .",
    "consequently , an increasing interest in their study has risen in recent years @xcite .",
    "interestingly , signatures of correlations having no classical counterpart can be traced even in separable ( non - entangled ) states , but their nature is rather different from entanglement @xcite .",
    "in fact , while entanglement is a consequence of the superposition principle , more general forms of nonclassical correlations arise essentially from the noncommutativity of quantum observables . when speaking about composite systems , separable states are often perceived as essentially classical . however , _",
    "truly _ classical states , i.e. states which contain only classical correlations , represent just a subset of separable states .",
    "moreover , it is also possible to show that almost all separable states possess a finite amount of nonclassical correlations @xcite .",
    "this has fueled a still unsettled debate , and an active stream of research , to decide whether separable states containing nonclassical correlations can be also directly useful for quantum information tasks @xcite .",
    "to quantitatively assess various aspects of entanglement , several entanglement measures have been adopted and extensively studied @xcite . in a similar fashion , more recently a zoology of indicators of nonclassical correlations ( in separable or entangled states )",
    "have been introduced @xcite , among which the most popular being _ quantum discord _ @xcite .",
    "a nice facet of discord is that it has an immediate characterization in information theory , it is endowed with operational interpretations @xcite , and its evaluation for bipartite states of simple quantum systems such as two - level systems ( qubits ) is conceptually straightforward , albeit technically hard .",
    "studies on nonclassicality indicators are not restricted to finite dimensions , but have also been extended to quantum systems with infinite - dimensional state space , where correlations are encoded between continuous variables ( cvs ) , that is , variables with continuous spectra .",
    "they are represented by , e.g. , modes of the electromagnetic field described by quadrature amplitudes . for these systems , a privileged role is played by the states possessing a gaussian wigner function , the so called gaussian states , as they are easy to handle both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . although gaussian states are sometimes flagged as the `` most classical '' class of continuous - variable ( cv ) states because of the positivity of their wigner function , recent results of the nonclassicality indicators show the opposite .",
    "namely , a recently derived analytical form of quantum discord for two  mode gaussian states @xcite reveals that , contrarily to the above naive categorization , all non - product bipartite gaussian states have a nonzero discord and so exhibit nonclassical correlations .",
    "another nonclassicality indicator frequently employed in the literature is the _ measurement - induced disturbance _ or _ mid _ , introduced in @xcite .",
    "a good property of mid is the intrinsic symmetry under swapping of the subsystems ( unlike discord ) but the main flaw is that it does not incorporate any optimization over local measurements , therefore usually returning an an overestimation of the actual amount of nonclassical correlations .",
    "the necessity of a more faithful nonclassicality quantifier motivated the introduction of a new indicator called _ amid _ ( _ ameliorated measurement - induced disturbance _ ) which is an ameliorated synthesis of the discord and mid , being both symmetric as mid and optimized as discord .",
    "it has been applied to characterize nonclassical correlations of arbitrary two  qubit mixed states @xcite .",
    "the amid is defined as the difference between the total ( quantum ) and the classical mutual information @xcite , where the latter quantity represents the maximum classical correlations that can be extracted from a bipartite state via local measurements on subsystems . here",
    "an optimization over all possible bi - local measurements is involved , which represents the nontrivial part in calculation of the amid .    in the present work ,",
    "we continue the programme of characterizing quantum versus classical correlations beyond entanglement in cv systems .",
    "specifically , we extend the definitions of mid and amid to the paradigmatic class of two  mode gaussian states .",
    "contrary to the case of discord , which has been computed for gaussian states restricting the optimization to gaussian measurements only @xcite , for the nonclassicality indicators considered here non - gaussian measurements play an important role .",
    "the mid is in fact obtained as the state disturbance induced by local projections onto fock states ( photon counting ) , a clearly non - gaussian measurement .",
    "this can be done analytically for simple cases ( such as pure two  mode squeezed states ) and requires numerical evaluation in more general gaussian states . for the amid ,",
    "a competition between photon counting and optimized gaussian measurements takes place in the maximization of the classical mutual information .",
    "we define a gaussian version of amid ( gaussian amid ) , restricted to gaussian measurements in analogy with the gaussian discord @xcite , and provide the analytical framework for its computation , obtaining simple closed forms for relevant families of states , including pure states and squeezed thermal states .",
    "we compare this measure with mid and gaussian discord , elucidating similarities and differences with the two  qubit case @xcite .",
    "similarly , we find that also for gaussian states , in most cases , mid significantly overestimates quantum correlations , and we provide evidence for states with nearly vanishing discord but arbitrarily large mid . yet , quite interestingly , we find a finite region of two  mode gaussian states where mid is strictly smaller than the optimal gaussian amid , meaning that in those instances non - gaussian measurements are necessarily optimal for the calculation of the classical mutual information and for the amid .",
    "this subset of states includes , surprisingly , pure two  mode squeezed states , for which local photon countings are found to be therefore `` less disturbing '' than local homodyne detections ( which realize the optimal gaussian measurements in this case ) , and allow one to extract strictly more strongly correlated classical random variables from the pure gaussian states .",
    "the gap between photon counting and homodyne detection in the degrees of classical mutual information and amid persists even in the limit of infinite squeezing .",
    "such a finding is quite unexpected and certainly deserves further investigation with an eye on potential practical applications . yet",
    ", this agrees in spirit with with a series of somehow related results : for example , the best operation to clone gaussian coherent states , as well as the best partial measurement achieving the optimal information / disturbance tradeoff for the same type of state , and the best measurement localizing maximum bipartite entanglement for gaussian states , are all known to be non - gaussian @xcite .",
    "recall also that non - gaussian measurements are necessary for universal cv quantum computation with gaussian cluster states @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secprelim ]",
    "we set up the notation and recall the main concepts of gaussian states and gaussian measurements , followed by an overview of the nonclassicality measures landscape .",
    "the derivation of a manageable expression of mid ( associated to local fock projections ) for two  mode gaussian states , in closed form for pure states , is presented in section [ secmid ] . in section [ secgamid ]",
    "we face the evaluation of the amid for arbitrary two  mode gaussian states .",
    "we bound amid from above by the minimum between the mid and the gaussian amid .",
    "the latter is defined by restricting the optimization to bi - local gaussian measurements , adopting the techniques used for discord in @xcite , and we provide closed analytical forms for it on special families of two  mode gaussian states .",
    "section [ secdiscuss ] presents a thorough comparison between mid , gaussian amid and gaussian quantum discord on random two ",
    "mode gaussian states , highlighting hierarchical and ordering relations between the three measures .",
    "upper and lower bounds to the gaussian amid at fixed gaussian discord are identified .",

    "<S> we study quantum correlations beyond entanglement in two  mode gaussian states of continuous variable systems , by means of the measurement - induced disturbance ( mid ) and its ameliorated version ( amid ) . in analogy with the recent studies of the gaussian quantum discord , we define a gaussian amid by constraining the optimization to all bi - local gaussian positive operator valued measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the optimization explicitly for relevant families of states , including squeezed thermal states . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find that there is a finite subset of two  mode gaussian states , comprising pure states , where non - gaussian measurements such as photon counting are globally optimal for the amid and realize a strictly smaller state disturbance compared to the best gaussian measurements . however , for the majority of two  mode gaussian states the unoptimized mid provides a loose overestimation of the actual content of quantum correlations , as evidenced by its comparison with gaussian discord . </S>",
    "<S> this feature displays strong similarity with the case of two qubits . </S>",
    "<S> upper and lower bounds for the gaussian amid at fixed gaussian discord are identified . </S>",
    "<S> we further present a comparison between gaussian amid and gaussian entanglement of formation , and classify families of two  mode states in terms of their gaussian amid , gaussian discord , and gaussian entanglement of formation . </S>",
    "<S> our findings provide a further confirmation of the genuinely quantum nature of general gaussian states , yet they reveal that non - gaussian measurements can play a crucial role for the optimized extraction and potential exploitation of classical and nonclassical correlations in gaussian states . </S>"
