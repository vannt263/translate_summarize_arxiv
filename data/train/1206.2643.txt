    "core - collapse supernovae show a diversity of absorption features in their spectra near maximum light , reflecting a diversity in the composition of the outer envelope of their massive star progenitors at the ends of their lives @xcite .",
    "in particular , some sne show no evidence of hydrogen ( type ib ) or no evidence for either hydrogen or helium ( type ic ) , suggesting extensive mass loss in the progenitor star sufficient to complete stripping of the h and he layers of its outer envelope ( * ? ? ?",

    "stellar evolutionary considerations point to two likely channels for these stripped - envelope core - collapse supernovae ( type ibc supernovae ) .",
    "these channels are : ( i ) high - mass wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars with strong metal line - driven winds with rotation likely playing an important role @xcite , and ( ii ) lower - mass helium - stars in close - binary systems who lose their envelopes via roche lobe overflow or common envelope evolution @xcite .",
    "searches for the progenitor stars of sn  ibc in pre - explosion imaging have yet to yield a progenitor detection , but have provided upper limits that challenge the hypothesis that their progenitors are massive wr stars like those seen in the local group @xcite .    by measuring the metallicity of the host environments of type  ibc sne as a proxy for the metallicity of the progenitor stars",
    ", we may be able to distinguish between these two progenitor models .",
    "mass loss in wr stars is enhanced at high metallicity @xcite .",
    "if the primary sn  ibc progenitor channel is single wr stars , then the rate of sn  ibc relative to sne that show h features ( sn  ii ) would be enhanced at high metallicity ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the ratio of sn  ic to ib should similarly be higher . in binary progenitor systems , massive primary stars may still strip their envelopes primarily via wr winds , but there exists an additional channel for sn  ic to be produced by relatively low mass ( @xmath4 ) stars which may dominate at low metallicity .",
    "this channel calls for the mass transfer to occur while the star is in the core helium burning or later phases @xcite .",
    "because either channel calls for massive , short - lived stars to produce the explosions , the metallicity of the sn host environment should be an appropriate proxy for the metallicity of the progenitor star .",
    "additionally , a connection has emerged between long - duration gamma ray bursts ( long grbs ) and one particular subtype of sn  ibc : broad - lined type ic sne ( ic - bl ; @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the broad and highly blueshifted absorption features of sne ic - bl indicate high photospheric expansion velocities , @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this grb - sn connection can be explained by the gravitational collapse of a massive ( @xmath7 ) progenitor star that produces a rapidly rotating and accreting compact object ( central engine ) that powers a relativistic outflow ( the collapsar model , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , radio observations demonstrate that only a small fraction ( @xmath8 ) of sne ic - bl harbor relativistic outflows @xcite .",
    "because angular momentum loss due to metal line - driven winds could prevent the compact remnant from rotating fast enough to produce a relativistic outflow , a metallicity threshold ( @xmath9 ) has been proposed for collapsars @xcite .",
    "recent observations fundamentally challenge the role of metallicity in grb production @xcite .",
    "sn  2009bb provides an example of a sn  ic - bl produced in a super - solar metallicity environment and harboring a central engine @xcite , and lgrbs with relatively high - metallicity host environments have now been identified @xcite .",
    "in contrast , sn  2010ay was a sn  ic - bl with extreme explosion properties that occurred in a sub - solar metallicity environment and without evidence for a central engine ( @xcite ; see also sn  2007bg , @xcite ) .    in the past few years",
    ", several observational studies have sought to measure the characteristics of the host environments of sn  ibc .",
    "@xcite used sdss spectroscopy to study the metallicity distribution of 115 sne ( 19 sn  ibc ) and found that sn  ibc host environments are metal - enriched compared to those of sn  ii . extending the work of @xcite , @xcite reach a similar result using sdss photometry to estimate metallicities for 701 sn ( 98 sn  ibc ) host galaxies .",
    "@xcite examine the host galaxies of core - collapse sne discovered by the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) and find that sn  ic are more common in high - metallicity environments ( `` giant '' host galaxies , @xmath10  mag ) , while sn  ib , iib and ic - bl dominate in low - metallicity environments ( `` dwarf '' host galaxies ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite perform spectroscopy to measure the metallicity of the host environments of 28 and 20 sn  ibc , respectively , finding no statistically significant difference between the metallicity distribution of sn ib and ic . extending the work of @xcite",
    ", @xcite performed a similar spectroscopy study of 35 sn  ibc host environments , finding that sn  ic come from significantly higher - metallicity host environments than sn  ib , with sn  ic - bl falling in between .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite have examined sdss spectroscopy of 519 sne ( 67 sn  ibc ) , finding that sn  ic - bl preferentially occur in low - mass , low - metallicity host galaxies relative to other core - collapse sne .",
    "however , there is a prominent observational bias that affects the progenitor metallicity distribution inferred from observations of most known sn host galaxies .",
    "the well - known relation between the luminosity and global - metallicity of star - forming galaxies ( the @xmath11 relation , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that a metallicity distribution measured only from objects found in targeted sn searches , which look for transients in fields centered on nearby and luminous galaxies , will be biased towards high metallicities .",
    "here we describe a new spectroscopic study of sn  ibc host galaxy metallicities unbiased with respect to the @xmath11 relation .",
    "we have obtained spectra of 60  host environments of sn  ibc discovered only by untargeted transient searches ( 13  sne ib , 10  sne iib , 24  sne ic , 8  sne ic - bl , 3  of indeterminate type sn  ib / c , and 2 with agn - dominated host environments , section  [ sec : fluxmea ] ) .",
    "previous spectroscopic studies of sn  ibc host environments have included relatively few sne discovered by untargeted searches , totaling @xmath12 objects .",

    "we describe the characteristics of this sample , our optical observations , and our spectroscopic methodology .",
    "we present and analyze the host galaxy metallicities and other physical properties derived from these observations in section  [ sec : res ] and combine with previous spectroscopic surveys of sn  ibc host environments in section  [ sec : combsurv ] . in section  [ sec : se ] we discuss possible systematics affecting our results . in section  [ sec : disc ]",
    "we discuss our results in relation to sn  ibc progenitor models and the sn - grb connection and we suggest implications for future studies of sn  ibc .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we have observed the host galaxies of 60  sne  ibc reported in the international astronomical union circulars ( iaucs ) and/or astronomer s telegrams between 1990 - 2011 . when transient searches operate by returning repeatedly to a pre - selected , typically bright , set of galaxies , we refer to the sne found in those galaxies by those searches to be `` targeted . ''",
    "we refer to any sn discovered by other means as `` untargeted , '' including discoveries by wide - field optical surveys , sne identified by targeted searches in anonymous background galaxies , and sne discovered serendipitously during observations of unrelated objects .",
    "we observed only untargeted discoveries and prioritized those sne with reliable classifications , host galaxies which did not already have previously published metallicity measurements , and which were visible at low airmass during the time of our observations .    in total , we present optical spectroscopy with s / n sufficient for metallicity measurements for 50  host galaxies , with median redshift @xmath13 .",
    "the discoverer of each sn in our sample is listed in table  [ tab : prop ] .",
    "spectroscopic metallicity estimates have been previously published for only 15  of these galaxies .",

    "our conclusion that the combined sample of @xmath727 sn  ibc has not revealed a difference between the metallicity distributions of sn  ib and ic may therefore conflict with the suggestion by @xcite that a sample of 18 photometric metallicity measurements for sn  ibc host galaxies could reveal a significant difference .    in summary ,",
    "the role of explosion site spectroscopy in sn host environment studies is complex .",
    "the ability to isolate sn explosion sites is limited for smaller galaxies and at larger redshifts ( e.g. those found by untargeted surveys ) .",
    "however , given the significantly larger baseline for making measurements of metallicity distributions offered by untargeted sn searches ( section [ sec : targeffect ] ) , the effect of physical resolution is likely to play a secondary role . substituting nuclear for explosion site spectroscopy can lead to discrepancies in metallicity of @xmath514  dex , but we find that small differences in metallicity distributions could still be recovered by studies employing nuclear spectroscopy . however , the additional uncertainty introduced by photometric metallicity measurements is larger and may limit the role of these investigations in discovering differences in metallicity distributions , unless sufficient statistical power can be gained by larger sample size .",
    "the spectral classification of sne could also potentially effect the metallicity distribution inferred for the host environments of each sn type ( see also section  [ sec : typing ] ) .",
    "it is unlikely that a sn  ic would be mistaken for a sn  ib , if the type is designated based on a clear detection of lines , but it is possible for a sn  ib to be classified as an sn  ic if the he lines are weak and s / n is poor , or if the he lines have not yet developed at the epoch of spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "misidentifying sn  ib as sn  ic could act to blur any distinctions in the metallicity distribution of their host environments .",
    "we evaluate the possibility that this blurring could hide a large ( @xmath617  dex ) difference in the metallicity distributions of sn  ib and ic host environments for a dataset as large as the combined sample using simulations .",
    "we randomly draw sn  ib and ic metallicities from gaussian distributions with widths of @xmath617  dex and then mis - attribute a certain fraction of the draws to sn  ic .",
    "we find that the ks  test indicates a statistically significant difference ( @xmath542 at @xmath345 ) unless a large percentage ( @xmath728 ) of sn  ib are mis - classified as sn  ic",
    ".    it can be difficult to distinguish normal sn  ib from sn  iib , especially if spectra are not available near peak .",
    "there is a diversity in the hydrogen mass surrounding sne iib @xcite and , spectroscopically , sn  iib seem to represent a transitional type between sn  ib and sn  ii @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have suggested that sn  iib prefer low - mass , low - metallicity host galaxies .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile these observations into a consistent progenitor model , but the conclusions of @xcite imply that grouping sn  ib and iib together ( as @xcite and @xcite have done explicitly ) could bias downward the metallicity distribution inferred for sn  ib environments",
    ".    similarly , if sn  ic - bl are grouped together with sn  ic , the sn  ic metallicity distribution could also be biased downward ( section  [ sec : combicbl ] ) .",
    "there is no clear definition of the ejecta velocity or line width that distinguishes sn  ic - bl from sn  ic , and any distinction will strongly depend on the spectroscopy epoch due to the velocity evolution of the photosphere ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have attempted to reduce the effects of sn classification errors by revisiting the sn spectroscopy on a case - by - case basis , rather than relying on the classification reported in the iaucs , and by separating our dataset based on our degree of confidence in the classifications ( gold and silver samples ; section  [ sec : typing ] ) . of the previous studies in our combined sample ( section  [ sec : combsurv ] ) , @xcite and @xcite made similar revisions to sn classifications , while @xcite and @xcite have relied on classifications reported in the circulars .",
    "the number of optical transients detected by sn searches often exceeds the resources available for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "for example , because sne without host galaxies clearly detected in discovery images may be mistaken for non - sn optical transients , the spectroscopic follow - up for some sn searches will be biased against sne with low - luminosity host galaxies @xcite .",
    "similarly , some untargeted sn searches such as essence and sdss - ii have focused on discovering sne  ia at the exclusion of core - collapse sne @xcite . because the host galaxy properties of sn  ia differ systematically from those of sn  ibc ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this selection effect could influence resulting studies of sn  ibc host environments .",
    "moreover , some optical surveys are less sensitive to sn detection in the central regions of galaxies . however , because the photometric and host galaxy properties of sn  ib and ic are significantly more similar to other subclasses of sne , the systematic effects of biases in sn search spectroscopic follow - up is likely to effect sn  ib and ic in similar ways",
    ". therefore we expect it to be a second order effect influencing the results of this study , likely much smaller than the previous effects discussed .    in a magnitude",
    "limited survey , the ratio of sn  ic to ib has been estimated to be @xmath729 @xcite . in our study , this ratio is similar , 1.8 , suggesting no significant bias for or against sn  ib or ic . for comparison ,",
    "this ratio is 1.4 for @xcite , 2.1 for @xcite , 0.5 for @xcite , and 1.25 for @xcite .",
    "sn  ic - bl , comprising @xmath730 of our sample , are over - represented in our sample with respect to galaxy - targeted , volume - limited surveys ( e.g. @xmath731 of sn  ibc in loss , not including sn  iib , @xcite ) .",
    "this is a natural consequence of two factors .",
    "first , sn  ic - bl typically have brighter peak luminosities than other sne  ibc ( @xmath732  mag in @xmath733-band , @xcite ) and can therefore be discovered over a larger volume in a magnitude - limited survey .",
    "indeed , the median redshift of sne  ic - bl in our sample ( @xmath734 ) is nearly twice that of the other sne  ibc in our sample ( @xmath735 ) .",
    "second , we have found that ic - bl preferentially occur in low - metallicity galaxies that will have preferentially lower luminosities ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these galaxies are therefore under - represented in galaxy - targeted sn searches , but are not excluded from the untargeted sn searches we draw our sample from .",
    "we further note that the percentage of sn  iib in our sample ( @xmath736 ) is similar to the value found by @xcite among those sn classified and reported in the iau circulars : @xmath737 of sn  ibc .",
    "however , @xcite report an sn  iib rate @xmath738 times this value based on sne found by loss .",
    "@xcite that the loss classifications are based primarily on photometry ( in particular , identification of the double - peaked sn  iib lightcurve shape ) , while classifications reported in the circulars are primarily based on single - epoch spectroscopic observations . finally , we note that any effect due to the cosmic star formation history should be negligible over the modest redshift range ( @xmath739 ) of our sample @xcite .",
    "an additional systematic effect could act if the host galaxy properties of sn  ibc are found to correlate with the explosion peak magnitude , as has been found for sn  ia @xcite .",
    "for example , if it were the case that sn  ic - bl in low - mass / metallicity galaxies are brighter than their counterparts in brighter galaxies , they would be over - represented in samples of host galaxy spectroscopy .",
    "this potential effect could be evaluated more thoroughly with more extensive studies of sn  ibc lightcurve properties , as the sample size of existing studies are small @xcite , or by performing a volume - limited survey . moreover",
    ", dust obscuration could prevent the discovery of a significant fraction of sne @xcite , and could potentially be correlated with both host galaxy and explosion properties .      due to the galaxy @xmath11 relation ,",
    "the lowest metallicity galaxies will also have the lowest luminosities , and may therefore be under - represented in spectroscopic studies that require sufficient s / n in the nebular emission lines to derive metallicity .",
    "table  [ tab : noz ] indicates that we are potentially excluding 3 sn  ic in low - metallicity hosts from our sample due to insufficient s / n , while we are likely only excluding one such sn  ib .",
    "the effect of these exclusions is significant : if we suppose that each of the excluded galaxies falls at the low - metallicity end of the observed distribution , than the median metallicities we measure for the sn  [ ib , ic ] in our sample become log(o / h)+12@xmath740 $ ] .",
    "considering these excluded galaxies indicates that the median metallicity for sn  ic host environments could be _ lower _ than for sn  ib in our sample .",
    "such a revision would not conflict with the results of our statistical tests , which indicate that the difference we measure in the metallicity distributions of sn  ib and ic host environments is not significant ( section  [ sec : stat ] ) .",
    "this illustrates the role of small number statistics in spectroscopic studies of sn  ibc host environments .",
    "moreover , it advocates for continued follow up of supernova host environments with facilities capable of measuring metallicity for the low - luminosity , relatively high - redshift host galaxies discovered by untargeted sn searches .",
    "the new observations presented in this work , and previous observations synthesized in our combined dataset , suggest and constrain differences in the progenitor star population of sne  ibc .",
    "the modest difference observed in the median metallicity of sn  ib and ic host environments corresponds to a very small difference in mass - loss rates for single star progenitors . in general ,",
    "the mass loss rates of massive stars is taken to scale as @xmath741 where @xmath742 @xcite or perhaps @xmath743 for wr winds @xcite . the difference in median metallicity we measure for sn  ib and ic from explosion site spectroscopy of gold - classification sne in our untargeted study ( section  [ sec : metaldist ] ) then corresponds to a difference in mass loss rates of a factor of @xmath744 for the power law slope @xmath745 .",
    "if we use instead the median difference inferred from the combined sample using only explosion - site spectroscopy ( section  [ sec : combdist ] ) , the mass loss rate differs by a factor of @xmath746 . in this simplistic analysis",
    ", it seems improbable that this small difference in mass loss rate is sufficient to strip the entire he layer from the progenitor star in order to produce the envelope composition indicated by the spectrum of the explosion .    in more detail ,",
    "the difference in the sn  ib and ic metallicity distributions can be interpreted in terms of a metallicity - dependence for the critical initial - mass required for a progenitor star to explode as sn  ib or ic .",
    "@xcite estimated how this critical mass depends on metallicity by comparing the observed difference in the rates of sn  ib and ic in different metallicity bins to a model that has an explicit dependence of the threshold mass for sn  ib and ic explosions .",
    "using photometric metallicity estimates , they find that the critical mass varies by a factor of @xmath28 over a factor of @xmath25 in metallicity .",
    "however , our combined dataset indicates that a difference in the metallicity distribution of sn  ib and ic has yet to be measured robustly ( section  [ sec : combibic ] ) , suggesting that the metallicity - dependence of this critical mass may be much more subtle .",
    "moreover , the observed relation between galaxy mass , metallicity , and star formation rate implies that metal - poor galaxies typically have higher specific star formation rates @xcite . in a single star progenitor model where",
    "sn  ic are produced by more massive stars , this could indicate an elevated rate of sn  ic relative to sn  ib in metal - poor galaxies if the star formation events are short - lived .",
    "this could potentially mask the effect of metal - line dependent winds .",
    "our measurements of the ages of young stellar populations of sn  ibc host galaxies do not indicate that sn  ic come from younger stellar populations ( section  [ sec : yage ] ) , but a larger sample is needed to address this question in detail . a metallicity - dependent slope for the initial mass function could also effect sn  ibc rates @xcite .",
    "assuming sn  ic progenitors are more massive than those of sn  ib , a top - heavy imf in low - metallicity environments would elevate the sn  ic / ib rate and could push the metallicity distribution of sn  ic downward .",
    "@xcite suggest that luminosity limits from pre - explosion imaging and ejecta masses from light - curve modeling rule out massive wr progenitors for a sample of nearby sn  ibc .",
    "however , the sn  ibc studied by @xcite are primarily in nearby , high - mass host galaxies that are likely to reflect high - metallicity progenitor stars . in essentially",
    "all progenitor models , sn  ibc progenitors are expected to be less massive ( and less luminous ) at higher metallicities .",
    "indeed , the rate of sn  ibc in nearby ( @xmath27 ) , low - metallicity environments is expected to be quite low ( at best a few per year ) , making direct progenitor detection observationally challenging @xcite . moreover , local extinction may play a larger role in obscuring sn progenitor stars than previously recognized @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that roche lobe overflow via binary interaction could be responsible for stripping significant amounts of material from the progenitor stars of sn  ibc .",
    "observations of ob stars indicate that a significant percentage of potential type  ibc sn progenitors are likely to be in interacting binary systems @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that the observed metallicity - dependence of the relative rates of sn  ii and ibc can be reproduced using binary population synthesis models informed by the observed populations of red supergiants , wolf - rayet , and other massive stars .",
    "@xcite have argued based on sn rates that the majority of sn  ibc progenitors may come from binary star systems .",
    "however , additional modeling is needed to predict the relative metallicity - distribution of sn  ib and ic that would result from binary progenitor stars .",
    "moreover , the effect of mixing may further complicate the comparison of observations to sn  ibc progenitor models for both single and binary stars @xcite .      in the `` collapsar '' model , the progenitors of lgrbs found in association with snic - bl ( grb - sne )",
    "are massive stars with high rates of core rotation , implying sub - solar metallicities ( @xmath9 ) in order to minimize angular momentum losses due to line - driven winds @xcite .",
    "the observational result that most lgrbs and grb - sne are discovered in dwarf , sub - solar metallicity galaxies has been interpreted as evidence supporting this model @xcite .",
    "because snic - bl have traditionally been found in higher - metallicity environments , a `` cut - off '' metallicity has been proposed to distinguish stars which will produce grb - sne from those that will produce non - relativistic snic - bl @xcite .",
    "however , several discoveries have challenged the role of metallicity in the production of lgrbs .",
    "lgrbs and relativistic , engine - driven sne have been found in super - solar metallicity environments @xcite .",
    "moreover , snic - bl with strong limits on the association of relativistic ejecta have been found in sub - solar metallicity environments ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this shift in the discovery environments of grbs and snic - bl can be explained in terms of the transient search strategy  grbs are discovered via their gamma - ray emission through untargeted searches , while past studies of snibc host environments drew primarily from galaxy - targeted searches , which are heavily biased towards higher - metallicity host environments ( see section  [ sec : targeffect ] ) .",
    "the advent of wide - field , untargeted sn searches has enabled the discovery of snic - bl in sub - solar metallicity environments .",
    "indeed , the results from this work and @xcite demonstrate that snic - bl preferentially occur in lower - metallicity environments than snib or ic ( see section  [ sec : metaldist ] and section  [ sec : combicbl ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the observed metallicity distribution of lgrb host environments has been interpreted as a secondary manifestation of a preference for high - star formation rate environments @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with this view . in section  [ sec : yage ] we found that snic - bl host environments potentially have younger stellar populations than those of other snibc and more similar to nearby lgrbs . in section  [ sec : metaldist ] we find that the untargeted snic - bl in our sample have a median metallicity @xmath632  dex higher than that of the nearby lgrbs ( @xmath574 ) , but given the small size of both samples ( @xmath747 and 7 , respectively ) , the ks test indicates no significant difference between the distributions ( @xmath748 ) .    in summary ,",
    "observations of sne discovered by untargeted searches have substantially reduced the discrepancy reported between the metallicity distribution of snic - bl with and without associated lgrbs , while verifying a shared preference for environments with high - star formation rates and/or very young stellar populations .",
    "these findings are consistent with the view that massive stars ( @xmath749 ) are the common progenitor for both these types of explosions , but suggest that metallicity does not play the primary role in the formation of a central engine .",
    "similarly , @xcite have found that host environment metallicity does not correlate to the gamma - ray energy release of lgrbs . @xcite",
    "have suggested , using the models of @xcite , that differential rotation in lgrb progenitors could moderate the coupling between wr winds and the stellar core and may be responsible for reducing the role of metallicity in the explosion .      in the coming years ,",
    "the discovery rate for sne promises to grow dramatically as existing high - cadence , wide field surveys continue to operate and new surveys such as the dark energy survey and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) come online . as lsst could discover @xmath750 sne per year , it is anticipated that the sn discovery rate in this era will far outstrip the capacity to perform spectroscopic follow - up on individual objects @xcite .",
    "this significant increase in the sn discovery rate could permit studies of untargeted sn  ibc host environments with sample sizes sufficient to detect even small ( @xmath751  dex ) differences in the sn  ib and ic metallicity distributions without statistical ambiguity .",
    "we suggest that a sample of @xmath752 such objects would be required for that purpose ( see section  [ sec : combibic ] ) , but caution that attention must continue to be paid to the systematic effects discussed in section  [ sec : se ] .",
    "moreover , such an sn discovery rate suggests that sn classification will become the limiting factor for certain science goals .",
    "investigating the grb - sn connection will be more difficult if a sample of well - classified sn  ic - bl can not be identified .",
    "in sn  ia samples for precision cosmology that are assembled using light curve - based classification alone , sn  ibc may be major contaminants ( @xmath753 ) because their light curve shape resembles that of sn  ia @xcite .",
    "the potential for ambiguity between sn  ia and sn  ibc light curves is especially great in the case of sn  ic - bl , because the average absolute peak magnitude is more similar to sn  ia than for normal sn  ib or ic @xcite .",
    "we therefore suggest that information about the distribution of host galaxy properties for sn  ia and ibc could be used to inform photometric sn classification in the lsst era .",
    "because sn  ic - bl preferentially occur in lower luminosity , lower metallicity host galaxies than other sn  ibc or sn  ia @xcite , the difference in flux between the sn and the host galaxy could be used to distinguish sn  ic - bl from other sn types for the dual purposes of 1 ) identifying sn  ic - bl for follow - up sn studies and 2 ) filtering sn  ibc from samples of sn  ia for precision cosmology .",
    "however , a study using information about the host galaxy distribution to inform sn classification would sacrifice the ability to make unbiased inferences about the properties of the host galaxy populations ( similar to the case of galaxy - targeted sn surveys ) and could introduce systematic effects if used to construct samples for sn  ia cosmology .",
    "moreover , it would also exclude events with unexpected properties , such as the engine - driven type  ic - bl sn2009bb that exploded in a luminous , high - metallicity host galaxy @xcite .",
    "we have presented the largest study to date of sn  ibc host environments unbiased with respect to the galaxy @xmath11 relation as imposed by galaxy - targeted sn searches . by reporting metallicity measurements for 50 objects ,",
    "we more than double the number of host environment metallicity measurements for sn  ibc discovered by untargeted surveys .      1 .",
    "sn  ibc host environments discovered through targeted surveys are significantly biased towards higher metallicities , representing host environments that are typically more enriched by @xmath70624% .",
    "the ratio of low - metallicity ( @xmath754 ) host environments probed by untargeted versus targeted sn searches is @xmath709 , and galaxy - targeted sn searches offer a smaller baseline for probing metallicity distribution differences .",
    "2 .   in our own sample and combining observations from all spectroscopic studies of sn  ibc host environments to date , we find no statistical difference between the metallicity distributions of sn  ib and ic or between sn  ib and iib .",
    "we place a limit on the median metallicity difference between sn  ib and ic ( @xmath751  dex ) and find that a sample @xmath621 as large would be required to unambiguously confirm a difference at that level .",
    "this limit corresponds to a very small difference in the mass loss rate of metal line - driven winds , suggesting that it may not be the dominant factor distinguishing sn  ib and ic progenitors . 3 .",
    "sn  ic - bl are found in host environments with substantially lower metallicity than sn  ic , confirming the result of @xcite .",
    "we show that the median metallicity of sn  ic - bl found by untargeted sn searches is @xmath610  dex lower than those found by targeted sn searches , yielding closer agreement to lgrb host environments .",
    "moreover , the young stellar populations of sn  ic - bl appear to be lower than sn  ib and ic , but the sample is not large enough to be significant .",
    "4 .   evaluating the systematic effects afflicting studies of sn  ibc host environment metallicities ,",
    "we find that the bias introduced by galaxy - targeted sn searches is most significant .",
    "galaxy - nucleus spectroscopy can serve as a good proxy for explosion site metallicity measurements , but studies using photometric metallicity estimates would require sample sizes @xmath28 times larger .",
    "biases in spectroscopic follow - up of sne discovered by optical transient searches and uncertainties in sn classification play smaller roles .    in the era of wide - field ,",
    "untargeted sn searches , we anticipate that significant progress will be made towards unveiling the progenitors of sn  ibc through the study of their host environments .",
    "we advocate for continued spectroscopic studies of the host environments of sn  ibc discovered by untargeted surveys to uncover or place stricter limits on the difference in the metallicity distribution of sn  ib and ic .",
