    "multi - access networks are increasingly emerging as an integral part of many communication and control systems with a central data processing or decision making unit , such as the uplink of wireless cellular communications , sensor networks , and machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communication systems .",
    "such multi - access communication networks usually have low latency constraints for their information , due to their nature or application .",
    "these delay requirements , along with the desire for low - complexity system designs , call for schemes and protocols that employ finite blocklengths , even on the order of several hundred symbols , and achieve high levels of reliability at the same time .    a mathematical analysis and design of multi - access networks with such stringent latency requirements ,",
    "however , can not rely on conventional information theoretic results , which assume asymptotically large blocklengths and vanishingly small error probability .",
    "it is therefore critical to develop rigorous non - asymptotic results that are tight for finite blocklengths .",
    "although this has been an strong trend in the early ages of information theory  @xcite , there has been renewed interest in this direction since the landmark works of  @xcite .",
    "the main theme of these works is treating mutual information as a random variable ( rv )  @xcite , which has a stochastic behavior based on the transmitted input and the channel noise and interference . this idea is mainly developed in the information spectrum approach of verd and han  @xcite , which suggests that the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of this rv characterizes performance in terms of the probability that the channel can not support the communication rate and causes an `` outage '' for the actual codeword to be correctly detected at the receiver .",
    "the highest coding rates arise if the error probability is dominated by the outage probability , and the probability of `` confusion '' , i.e. , the observation is wrongly decoded to any incorrect codeword , decays to zero .",
    "although tight non - asymptotic bounds obtained by the information spectrum approach can help with precise analysis and design of communication systems , their numerical computation are usually cumbersome .",
    "it is therefore of high practical interest to come up with accurate approximations of the coding rates that are still valid for moderately short blocklengths .",
    "capacity ( region ) , as a first - order statistic of the channel , is already a first - order approximation of the coding rates , but it is only useful for very long blocklengths .",
    "error exponent  @xcite is one conventional tool for this purpose , which applies large deviation theory ( ldt ) to the mutual information rv and studies the exponential decay in error probability of a fixed - rate coding scheme as the blocklength grows larger . although error exponent analysis can provide a rough estimate for finite - blocklength analysis , a method for finding sharper approximations employs the central limit theorem ( clt ) to the mutual information rv , specifically for rates close to capacity .",
    "this way , one can investigate the increase in coding rate of a scheme with fixed error probability as the blocklength grows larger and obtain second ( and higher ) order approximations .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated  @xcite that second - order approximations involving the fundamental quantity of _ channel dispersion _ , as a second order statistic of the channel , provide good estimates of the channel coding rates for moderate to short blocklengths .    in this paper , we show how similar ideas can be extended to a multi - user setting in which multiple users are communicating several independent messages to a single receiver over a gaussian multiple access channel ( mac ) . in particular , we present several non - asymptotic achievability bounds on the channel coding rates of a gaussian mac as a function of the finite blocklength , the fixed average error probability , and the users power constraints .",
    "our bounds suggest that the _ joint outage _",
    "event , in which either of the users mutual information is not strong enough to support its target rate , is the fundamental quantity that governs the performance over the gaussian mac .",
    "since this joint outage event is in general complex , we also give a slightly looser , but simpler to analyze non - asymptotic achievable region based on an _ outage - splitting _ idea  @xcite , in which the joint outage event is split into individual outage events via the union bound . applying the clt to our finite - blocklength results",
    ", we also obtain corresponding achievable second - order coding rate regions for the gaussian mac .",
    "in particular , we give explicit expressions for the achievable dispersion matrices of the gaussian mac in terms of the users power constraints .",
    "a critical ingredient of our analysis is the choice of input distribution for improving the second - order performance . in particular , consider the 2-user gaussian mac with maximal power constraints @xmath0 and @xmath1 . inspired by shannon  @xcite , rather than random coding using the common choice of independent and identically distributed  ( i.i.d ) gaussian input distributions @xmath2",
    "@xcite , which achieve the capacity region and are therefore optimal to first order , or their truncated versions lying in thin shells @xmath3 for an arbitrarily small @xmath4 , which are used by gallager for the error exponent analysis  @xcite , we focus on inputs having _ independent uniform distributions on the respective power shells _ , namely , the @xmath5-dimensional spheres  @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "consider a symmetric gaussian mac with blocklength  @xmath8 , average error probability @xmath9 , and powers @xmath10  db .",
    "figure 1 compares the approximate achievable rate regions for all of the aforementioned input distributions : independent power - shell inputs with both joint - outage and outage - splitting versions ; independent i.i.d .",
    "gaussian inputs ; independent truncated gaussian inputs ; and also the rate region achievable via time division multiple access ( tdma ) with power control ; along with the asymptotic cover - wyner capacity region  @xcite .",
    "we also depict a _ hypothetical _ rate region which would be achievable if the sum of independent power shell inputs fell on the sum - power shell . to show the tightness of the achievable rate regions , we also depict two straightforward second - order single - user ( su ) outer bounds and a conjectured second - order sum - rate outer bound .",
    "the details of all of these regions are given in section iv .",
    "we note that all of the approximation results are computed only up to second - order .",
    "[ fig - low ]    , average error probability @xmath9 , and powers @xmath10  db . ]    unlike the pentagon shape of the capacity region of the gaussian mac in the infinite blocklength regime , we observe that its second - order approximation has a curved shape with no sharp corners .",
    "moreover , the region resulting from independent power shell inputs lies roughly halfway between that of the i.i.d .",
    "gaussian inputs and that which would be achievable by the hypothetical `` sum - power shell '' input .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to one observed by gallager in his analysis of error exponents for the gaussian mac  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that , gaussian ( and truncated gaussian ) random codebooks , although optimal for achieving capacity , are not second - order optimal , and their finite blocklength achievable rate region falls well inside that of power shell inputs .",
    "another interesting observation is that , contrary to the infinite blocklength case , the tdma strategy with power control is not even sum - rate optimal .",
    "last but not least , the outage - splitting region of the power - shell input closely resembles that of the joint - outage version , and therefore its simplicity does not sacrifice much with respect to accuracy .    of course , the improved performance of the independent power shell inputs comes at the price of additional complexity in the analysis .",
    "first , although the variance of the sum is the sum of variances for two independent gaussians , the sum of two independent power shell inputs does not lie on the power shell corresponding to the sum of the powers , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "second , classical clt and ldt analysis do not apply directly for such non - i.i.d .",
    "inputs . to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "we develop new techniques : since power shell inputs can be constructed by normalizing i.i.d .",
    "gaussian rvs , we rely on a _",
    "clt for functions _ to develop the outage probability approximation ; additionally , we introduce a _ change of measure _ technique for the confusion probability , so that classical ldt can be applicable to prove its decay to zero .",
    "another main emphasis of our work has been to utilize standard and transparent methods to highlight the proof steps for finite blocklength analysis , especially when input cost constraints are involved .",
    "we are specifically focused on the method of encoding and decoding .",
    "although _ random coding and typicality decoding _ have proven to be powerful tools in information theory and the standard method for proving most source and channel coding theorems  @xcite , all non - asymptotic achievability bounds for the gaussian channel either use random coding but with maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding  @xcite , or employ typicality decoding but with non - random sequential encoding  @xcite .",
    "in addition , for the tightest bounds , handling the cost constraint is either done through relatively sophisticated geometric arguments  @xcite or via a relatively complicated introduction and analysis of composite hypothesis testing  @xcite . in this paper , we start by proving tight finite - blocklength achievability results for point - to - point ( p2p ) gaussian channels , which are at least second - order optimal , using the standard arguments of random coding and typicality decoding , with some slight modifications .",
    "as we will see , this approach appears easier to generalize than those in  @xcite to multi - user settings , specifically the gaussian mac , for which we obtain rather tight achievable second - order approximations using the random coding and modified typicality decoding method .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec - bg ]",
    ", we review the tightest achievability methods in the finite blocklength regime .",
    "then , in section  [ sec - p2p ] , to highlight the key elements of our proof techniques , we revisit the problem of the p2p gaussian channel , develop new non - asymptotic achievability bounds , and re - derive the second - order approximation of  @xcite . in section  [ sec - mac ] , we turn to to our problem of interest , prove finite - blocklength inner bounds for the gaussian mac , and then apply them to establish achievable second - order coding rates .",
    "we conclude the paper in section  [ sec - con ] and relegate some of the technical proofs to the appendices .",
    "to highlight the conciseness and simplicity of our approach in proving accurate non - asymptotic and approximate achievability results for cost - constrained channel models , specifically the p2p gaussian channel and the gaussian mac , in this section we review the sharpest and most well - known achievability methods in the literature .",
    "we first review the details of random coding and typicality decoding for proving the achievability side of the coding theorems , because of their simplicity and also because we slightly modify these methods to prove sharp achievability bounds for gaussian ( and other cost - constrained ) channels . to emphasize the transparency and conciseness of this approach , we will then review the details of two of the sharpest bounds for the gaussian channel , namely polyanskiy et al.s @xmath12 method based on composite hypothesis testing  @xcite and shannon s geometric method  @xcite , and point out the complexities of these methods and the difficulties in generalizing them to multi - user settings .",
    "we explain these methods to some level of details to highlight some of their key tools and concepts that we leverage in our later analysis .",
    "note that , in this section , we are concerned with non - asymptotic achievability bounds that are valid for any finite blocklength without requiring convergence conditions .",
    "the basic idea in an argument based upon random coding and typicality decoding can be reviewed most clearly for a p2p channel  @xmath13 .",
    "the channel encoder randomly generates @xmath14  codewords @xmath15 of the codebook independently according to some given @xmath5-letter distribution @xmath16 , where @xmath5 is the designated blocklength . observing the output @xmath17",

    "the error probability averaged over all possible realizations of the codebook can then be bounded as where   follows from averaging over the random codebook , and   follows from the union bound .",
    "the final result is that there exists a deterministic codebook consisting of @xmath14 codewords whose average error probability  @xmath35 satisfies  .",

    "<S> motivated by the growing application of wireless multi - access networks with stringent delay constraints , we investigate the gaussian multiple access channel ( mac ) in the finite blocklength regime . </S>",
    "<S> building upon information spectrum concepts , we develop several non - asymptotic inner bounds on channel coding rates over the gaussian mac with a given finite blocklength , positive average error probability , and maximal power constraints . employing central limit theorem ( clt ) approximations </S>",
    "<S> , we also obtain achievable second - order coding rates for the gaussian mac based on an explicit expression for its dispersion matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that , unlike the pentagon shape of the asymptotic capacity region , the second - order region has a curved shape with no sharp corners .    </S>",
    "<S> a main emphasis of the paper is to provide a new perspective on the procedure of handling input cost constraints for tight achievability proofs . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the complicated achievability techniques in the literature , we show that with a proper choice of input distribution , tight bounds can be achieved via the standard random coding argument and a modified typicality decoding . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we prove that codebooks generated randomly according to _ independent uniform distributions on the respective `` power shells '' _ perform far better than both independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) gaussian inputs and tdma with power control . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , analogous to an error exponent result of gallager , the resulting achievable region lies roughly halfway between that of the i.i.d . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian inputs and that of a hypothetical `` sum - power shell '' input . however , dealing with such a non - i.i.d . </S>",
    "<S> input requires additional analysis such as a new _ change of measure _ technique and application of a berry - esseen _ </S>",
