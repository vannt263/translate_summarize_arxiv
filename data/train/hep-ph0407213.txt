    "in references @xcite , we have shown how it was possible to obtain a precise regge description of high energy total @xmath0 scattering down to @xmath3 gev . apart from the interest in itself ,",
    "there has been a renewed interest in this high energy region because the imaginary part of the @xmath4 amplitude is needed for dispersive studies aiming at a precise description of @xmath0 data at low energies @xcite .",
    "a relevant property of our description is that it respects _ factorization_. this means that , for instance , the imaginary part of an amplitude @xmath5 is : @xmath6 the @xmath7 behavior comes from the so - called regge pole @xmath8 .",
    "all poles have @xmath9 and thus vanish for large @xmath10 , except the pomeron that scales like @xmath10 up to around 15 or 20 mev , where it dominates all other pole contributions , giving a common prediction @xmath11 for all @xmath0 channels . for larger energies it increases logarithmically . as a matter of fact",
    "there could be many regge poles exchanged in each channel , all them with their corresponding @xmath12 factors depending on @xmath8 and the particles in the initial state .",
    "using factorization , it is thus possible to obtain the @xmath0 regge amplitudes from those of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "total cross sections are then related to forward scattering amplitudes by : @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "thus we @xcite fitted the large @xmath17 and @xmath14 data compilation of the compass group as given in the particle data tables @xcite , and the few @xmath0 data @xcite points known to us down to @xmath3 imposing factorization .",
    "the fit parameters are largely dominated by the @xmath17 and @xmath14 experiments , but still we obtained a very precise description for @xmath0 total cross sections , that was in remarkable agreement with the @xmath18 data above 2 gev . at lower energies",
    "these data are in conflict with the @xmath18 reconstructed @xcite from lower energy phase shifts analysis and our results fall somewhere in - between .",
    "we refer to our paper @xcite for further details .",
    "in addition , we have also checked that our high energy results together with fits @xcite to the low energy satisfy two crossing symmetry sum rules .",
    "this is again of relevance because in the seventies @xcite there was a suggestion that the predictions of factorization @xmath19 mb , together with the existing phase shifts analysis at that time , violated crossing symmetry , suggesting @xmath20 mb .",
    "of course this was tenable until the first high energy @xmath18 were measured , and indeed the very same authors @xcite pointed out somewhat later that the central value should be raised to @xmath21 mb .",
    "the recent studies in @xcite used @xmath22 mb , following @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath18 data went largely unnoticed to our days , including to ourselves , so that in @xcite the use of factorization was only based on qcd considerations . in @xcite",
    "we `` rediscovered '' four different experimental works @xcite that we used in a reanalysis to find @xmath23 mb , while simultaneously respecting crossing .",
    "following the discussions of my talk on this meson2004 conference i came to know that there was another analysis @xcite of @xmath24 total cross sections . in that work ,",
    "a triple reggeon model is used to analyze several sets of experimental data on @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and obtain regge parameters with whom to extract total @xmath27 cross sections from @xmath28 and @xmath2 .",
    "the most relevant contribution of this paper is the inclusion of absorptive corrections in the last two reactions , which seems to decrease the results by about 10 to 15% . in fig.1",
    ", we show how our regge description , and in particular , our value @xmath23 mb indeed provides a good description of this data , which strongly disfavors a value more than two times smaller . following the authors we display only the statistical errors .",
    "systematic errors were estimated at the @xmath29 level .",
    "and the error bars are just statistical , however , the authors pointed out a  possible systematic error of @xmath30  . ]     and the error bars are just statistical , however , the authors pointed out a  possible systematic error of @xmath30  . ]",
