    "most spins in a magnetic nanoparticle are at the particle surface where the reduced coordination and the broken translational symmetry of the lattice are responsible for changes in some local physical properties of the material . among them",
    ", there is the reduction in exchange interaction constants and the increased local anisotropy at the particle surface with respect to bulk values @xcite phenomenological model that described this last phenomenon was first introduced by nel in @xcite , but experimental determination of the microscopic structure and properties of the surface of nanoparticles is still a challenge to be solved .",
    "for example , an estimate of the surface anisotropy constant can only extracted indirectly from magnetic measurements by fitting to an effective anisotropy constant @xcite .",
    "however , there are increasing evidences from experiments that surface effects play a dominant role in the anomalous low temperature magnetic properties of nanoparticle systems @xcite . therefore , simulations of magnetic properties in which microscopic parameters extracted form experiments are used @xcite may serve as a benchmark to test the phenomenological models at hand . in this article , we use the monte carlo method to simulate the magnetization processes of individual nanoparticles modeled by classical heisenberg spins on the maghemite lattice with radial surface anisotropy @xmath0 different from that on the core .",
    "the model considered is an extension to heisenberg spins of our previous mc simulation for an ising spin model of a @xmath1-fe@xmath2o@xmath3 ( maghemite ) particle @xcite .",
    "the particles considered have spherical or ellipsoidal shape with diameter @xmath4 and elongations @xmath5 ( in units of the cell size @xmath6 ) , containing from @xmath7 to @xmath8 spins .",
    "the surface spins of the particle are considered to be those on the outer unit cell and have anisotropy constant @xmath0 and radial local anisotropy axes along the directions @xmath9 , whereas core spins have uniaxial anisotropy @xmath10 pointing along the z - axis .",
    "indirect estimations of the anisotropy constants yield values in the range @xmath11 k , @xmath12 k , so we will fix @xmath13 k and vary only @xmath0 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in temperature units can be written as @xmath14+\\sum_{i= 1}^{n_{surf}}\\left[k_s(\\vec{s}_i \\cdot \\hat n_i)^2 \\right]\\ .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the first term , @xmath15 are the nearest - neighbours exchange constants among the spins in the two sublattices with different coordination of maghemite , all of them are antiferromagnetic , being @xmath16 the strongest in magnitude and making maghemite a ferrimagnetic compound @xcite .",
    "we have computed equilibrium configurations by starting from a disordered state at a high temperature and decreasing the temperature in steps @xmath17 .",
    "hysteresis loops are started from a saturating field along the core easy - axis that is decreased in steps @xmath18 , during which the magnetization is averaged over @xmath19 mc steps . in both cases ,",
    "the standard mc method for continuous spins has been used with a trial jump consisting in a combination of uniform and small angle around the current spin direction that allows to obtain reliable simulations for treat the weak and strong anisotropy cases with the same algorithm , see @xcite for the details .",
    "in fig . [ fig_1 ] , we show snapshots of the spin configurations attained after the cooling process previously described , for several values of the surface anisotropy constant @xmath0 .",
    "the pictures present a cut of one unit cell width along the equatorial plane and along the major axis of the particle . for values of @xmath0",
    "smaller than a certain critical value @xmath20 ( which depends on the particle size and on the shape ) , the radial anisotropy at the surface is not strong enough to ca nt the core spins towards the radial direction .",
    "therefore , the core spins are antiferromagnetically aligned with a small net magnetization component along the @xmath21 axis due a small number of non - compensated spins ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] for @xmath22 ) .",
    "however , at the particle surface , the spins present already a high degree of disorder due to the competition between the reduced local exchange field ( locally reduced with respect to that on the core spins ) and the anisotropy , inducing some degree of frustration at the surface . as @xmath0",
    "is further increased ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] for @xmath23 ) , the disorder of the surface spins is transmitted to the particle core and results in the departure of core spins from the local anisotropy axis towards the radial direction .",
    "finally , when anisotropy dominates over exchange energy ( @xmath24 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] for @xmath25 ) , the hedgehog - like structures are formed , with the spins pointing along the local radial direction and having antiparallel orientations with the nearest neighbors on the other sublattice .",
    "we have also studied the influence of surface anisotropy and particle shape on the magnetization reversal processes . for this purpose ,",
    "zero temperature hysteresis loops have been simulated using the procedure described previously for ellipsoidal particles with elongations @xmath5 and diameter @xmath4 .",
    "some selected results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , where the total magnetization component along the field direction ( left panels ) is shown together with the contribution of the surface and core spins to @xmath26 , the sum    of the projections of spins onto the local anisotropy axis ( central and right panels ) . by comparing the loops for @xmath0= 10 to those for @xmath0= 100 , we see that the coercive field increases and the remanence decreases with increasing surface anisotropy , independently of the elongation l of the particle .",
    "moreover , the presence of disordered groups of spins at the surface induced by surface anisotropy makes the loops more elongated and increases the closure fields of the loops as found also in experiments on ferrimagnetic oxides @xcite .",
    "the rounding of the loops near the coercive field clearly indicates a progressive departure from a uniform reversal mechanism with increasing @xmath0 . when looking only at the @xmath27 component , not much difference is appreciated between the loops for particles with different l because of the compensation of the spin components transverse to the field direction due to the symmetry of revolution of the particles around the @xmath21 axis .",
    "however , upon further inspection of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 contributions and animated snapshots taken along the loops @xcite , the details of the reversal process can be better under - stood .",
    "let us notice first that , when @xmath0 is increased from @xmath20 , the reversal mechanism changes from quasi - uniform ( induced by the core ) rotation at low @xmath0 values , to a process in which the formation of surface hedgehog - like structures induce the non - uniform switching of the whole particle . in the first regime ( @xmath22 case in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) , the core and surface spins point mostly along the z axis ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) except near the coercive field , where they make short excursions towards the radial direction driven by the surface anisotropy ( see the dips in @xmath29 and the cusps in @xmath28 ) . however , for @xmath0 > @xmath20 ( @xmath25 case in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) , surface spins remain near the local radial easy - directions ( @xmath32 ) during the reversal , while the core spins are dragged out the z local easy - axis by the surface spins during the reversal , except for values of h near the closure field .",
    "this is indicated by the widening of the dips in @xmath29 and the global decrease of @xmath29 values as @xmath0 increases .",
    "finally , let us remark also that , for all the @xmath0 considered , the @xmath28 values along the whole hysteresis loops increase with increasing @xmath33 , which indicates that the surface spins remain closer to the local radial direction during the reversal as particles become more elongated .",
    "when increasing @xmath33 , the dips in @xmath29 become less profound for @xmath24 , and indication that reversal of core spins along the radial direction is suppressed by the elongation . however , for weak anisotropy ( @xmath34 ) , the more elongated the particles are , the greater the deviation of surface spins towards the radial direction during the reversal .",
