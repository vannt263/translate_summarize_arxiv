    "at low temperatures , strongly correlated materials can display a surprising sensitivity to small amounts of imperfections and disorder .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced close to a quantum phase transition , where large fluctuations in space and time become fundamentally connected .",
    "thermodynamic and response properties of a material are then affected much more dramatically than close to a classical phase transition , permitting exotic phenomena like infinite - randomness critical points with activated rather than power - law dynamical scaling mccoy69,dsf9295,youngrieger96,pich98,motrunich00,thillhuse95,gbh96,riegeryoung96 , smeared transitions @xcite , or non - universal exponents at certain impurity quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "one interesting aspect of phase transitions in disordered systems are the griffiths effects @xcite .",
    "they are caused by large spatial regions that are devoid of impurities and can show local order even if the bulk system is in the disordered phase .",
    "the fluctuations of these regions are very slow because they require changing the order parameter in a large volume .",
    "griffiths @xcite showed that this leads to a singular free energy in a whole parameter region in the vicinity of the critical point which is now known as the griffiths phase . in generic classical systems ,",
    "the contribution of the rare regions to thermodynamic observables is very weak since the singularity in the free energy is only an essential one griffiths , bray89,randeria .",
    "the consequences for the dynamics are more severe with the rare regions dominating the long - time behavior randeria , bray87,dhar88 .",
    "due to the perfect disorder correlations in ( imaginary ) time , griffiths phenomena at zero temperature quantum phase transitions are enhanced compared to their classical counterparts . in random quantum ising systems",
    "@xcite and quantum ising spin glasses @xcite , thermodynamic quantities display power - law singularities with continuously varying exponents in the griffiths phase , with the average susceptibility actually diverging inside this region .    the systems in which these quantum griffiths phenomena have been shown unambiguously all have undamped dynamics ( a dynamical exponent @xmath2 in the corresponding clean system ) .",
    "however , many systems of experimental importance involve magnetic lohneysen96,mackenzie01,lonzarich99,maple98 or superconducting rogachev03 degrees of freedom coupled to conduction electrons which leads to overdamped dynamics characterized by a clean dynamical exponent @xmath3 . studying the effects of rare regions in this case",
    "is therefore an important issue . in recent years",
    ", there has been an intense debate on the theory of quantum griffiths effects in itinerant _ ising _ magnets .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that overdamped systems show quantum griffiths phenomena similar to that of undamped systems . however , recently it has been shown@xcite that the overdamping prevents the rare regions from tunneling leading to static rare regions displaying superparamagnetic rather than quantum griffiths behavior , at least for sufficiently low temperatures . in ref.millismorrschmalian",
    "it was also pointed out that different behavior is expected for systems with continuous spin symmetry .    in this paper , we examine quantum griffiths effects in itinerant _ heisenberg _ magnets .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : in contrast to the ising case , itinerant magnets with heisenberg symmetry ( in general , @xmath4 symmetry with @xmath5 ) do display power - law quantum griffiths singularities .",
    "the locally ordered rare regions are not static but retain their quantum dynamics .",
    "their low - energy density of states follows a power law , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the space dimensionality and @xmath8 is a continuously varying dynamical exponent .",
    "this leads to power - law dependencies of several observables on the temperature @xmath9 , including the specific heat , @xmath10 , and the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath11 .",
    "our results are not limited to heisenberg magnets , they generally apply to @xmath12 order parameters with @xmath5 including the superconductor - metal transition @xcite in thin nano - wires @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : scaling ] , we derive quantum griffiths effects from general scaling arguments based on the observation that a rare region in an itinerant heisenberg magnet is at its lower critical dimension .",
    "these arguments suggest a general classification of disordered quantum phase transitions in terms of the dimensionality of the rare regions . in section [ sec : large - n ] , we then present an explicit calculation for @xmath0 spin symmetry in the large-@xmath1 limit .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] by discussing the importance of the spin symmetry , the relation to kondo physics as well as possible experimental realizations of our predictions .",
    "our starting point is a quantum landau - ginzburg - wilson free energy functional for an @xmath1-component ( @xmath5 ) order parameter field @xmath13 . for definiteness , we consider the itinerant antiferromagnetic transition .",
    "the action of the clean system reads belitzkirkpatrick96,hertz76,millis93 @xmath14here , @xmath15 comprises position @xmath16 and imaginary time @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . the imaginary time direction which characterizes the quantum dynamics formally appears like an additional spatial dimension of a classical system .",
    "the perfect disorder correlations in this imaginary time direction are ultimately responsible for the enhancement of the griffiths effects at zero temperature .",
    "@xmath19 is the bare inverse propagator ( bare two - point vertex ) , whose fourier transform is @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the bare energy gap , i.e. , the bare distance from the clean critical point .",
    "we are interested in the case of overdamped spin dynamics ( @xmath22 ) with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the coupling constant between spin degrees of freedom and conduction electrons , with dos , @xmath25 , and fermi energy , @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is the lattice constant . in order to demonstrate the special behavior of heisenberg systems with @xmath22 , where overdamping is caused by the particle - hole continuum of itinerant electrons",
    ", we frequently discuss variable @xmath28 and compare the behavior with ballistic spin systems with @xmath2 .",
    "we will use a system of units with @xmath29 .",
    "the clean system undergoes the quantum phase transition when the renormalized gap @xmath30 vanishes .",
    "to introduce quenched disorder , we dilute the system with nonmagnetic impurities of spatial density @xmath31 , i.e. , we add a random potential , @xmath32 $ ] , to @xmath33 . here , @xmath34 are the the positions of the impurities , and @xmath35 is a positive short - ranged impurity potential .",
    "we first present the general scaling arguments leading to quantum griffiths behavior in this system . despite the dilution ,",
    "there are statistically rare large spatial regions devoid of impurities and thus unaffected by the disorder .",
    "the probability for finding such a region of volume @xmath36 , frequently referred to as an instanton , is @xmath37with @xmath38 .",
    "below the clean critical point , the rare regions can be locally in the ordered phase even though the bulk system is not . at zero temperature , each rare region is equivalent to a one - dimensional classical @xmath0 model in a rod - like geometry : finite in the @xmath7 space dimensions but infinite in imaginary time . for overdamped dynamics , @xmath22 ,",
    "the interaction in imaginary time direction is of the form @xmath39 .",
    "one - dimensional continuous - symmetry @xmath0 models with @xmath40 interaction are known to be exactly _ at _ their lower critical dimension@xcite .",
    "therefore , an isolated rare region of linear size @xmath41 can not independently undergo a phase transition .",
    "its energy gap depends exponentially on its volume ( i.e. , the effective spin of the droplet ) @xmath42equivalently , the susceptibility of such a region diverges exponentially with its volume . combining ( [ eq : prob ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) gives a power - law density of states for the energy gap @xmath43 ( to leading exponential accuracy ) , @xmath44where the second equality defines the customarily used dynamical exponent @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it continuously varies with disorder strength or distance from the clean critical point .",
    "many results follow from this .",
    "for instance , a region with a local energy gap @xmath43 has a local spin susceptibility that decays exponentially in imaginary time , @xmath46 . averaging by means of @xmath47 yields @xmath48the temperature dependence of the static average susceptibility is then @xmath49if @xmath50 , the local zero - temperature susceptibility diverges , even though the system is globally still in the disordered phase .",
    "analogously , the contribution of the rare regions to the specific heat @xmath51 can be obtained from @xmath52which gives @xmath53 .",
    "other observables can be determined in a similar fashion . the power - law density of states ( eq : dos ) in the griffiths phase of a disordered itinerant @xmath0 magnet and the resulting quantum griffiths singularities ( [ eq : chi_tau ] ) , ( eq : chi_t ) , ( [ eq : cv ] ) are the central results of this paper .",
    "they take the same form as the quantum griffiths singularities in undamped ( clean @xmath2 ) random quantum ising models mccoy69,dsf9295,youngrieger96,pich98,motrunich00 and quantum ising spin glasses @xcite .",
    "these scaling arguments suggest a general classification of griffiths phenomena in the vicinity of bulk phase transitions ( at least those described by landau - ginzburg - wilson theories ) with weak , random-@xmath54 or random - mass type disorder .",
    "it is based on the effective dimensionality of the rare regions .",
    "three cases can be distinguished :    \\(i ) if the rare regions are _ below _ the lower critical dimensionality @xmath55 of the problem , their energy gap depends on their size via a power law , @xmath56 .",
    "since the probability for finding a rare region is exponentially small in @xmath41 , the low - energy density of states in this first case is exponentially small .",
    "this leads to weak classical  griffiths singularities characterized by an essential singularity in the free energy .",
    "this case is realized in generic classical systems ( where the rare regions are finite in all directions and thus effectively zero - dimensional ) .",
    "it also occurs in quantum rotor systems with heisenberg symmetry and undamped ( @xmath2 ) dynamics@xcite . here",
    ", the rare regions are equivalent to one - dimensional classical heisenberg models which are also below @xmath57 .",
    "\\(ii ) in the second class , the rare regions are exactly _ at _ the lower critical dimension . in this case",
    ", their energy gap shows an exponential dependence [ like ( [ eq : gap ] ) ] on @xmath41 .",
    "as shown above , this leads to a power - law density of states and strong power - law quantum griffiths singularities .",
    "this second case is realized , e.g. , in classical ising models with linear defects @xcite and random quantum ising models ( each rare regions corresponds to a one - dimensional classical ising model ) @xcite as well as in the disordered itinerant quantum heisenberg magnets studied here ( the rare regions are equivalent to classical one - dimensional heisenberg models with @xmath58 interaction ) .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , in the third class , the rare regions are _ above _ the lower critical dimension , i.e. , they can undergo the phase transition independently from the bulk system . in this case",
    ", the locally ordered rare regions become truly static which leads to a smeared phase transition .",
    "this happens , e.g. , for classical ising magnets with planar defects planar_ising ( the rare regions are effectively two - dimensional ) or for itinerant quantum ising magnets @xcite where the rare regions are equivalent to classical one - dimensional ising models with @xmath58 interaction .",
    "to complement the general scaling arguments and to obtain quantitative estimates for the exponent @xmath8 we now perform an explicit calculation of the griffiths effects in the model ( [ eq : action ] ) in the large-@xmath1 limit .",
    "the approach is a generalization of bray s treatment bray87 of the classical case . in the large-@xmath1 limit , a clean system undergoes a quantum phase transition for @xmath59 with coupling constant @xmath60 and upper momentum cut off @xmath61 . for @xmath62 ,",
    "the clean system is in the ordered state with the order parameter @xmath63^{1/2},\\]]and vanishing gap . in the random system",
    ", we consider a droplet of size @xmath64 , devoid of impurities and determine its size dependent energy gap , @xmath65 .",
    "it is determined by the equation of state @xmath66 , where @xmath67@xmath68 is the field conjugate to the order parameter , @xmath69 , of the droplet and @xmath70for @xmath71 , both the @xmath72 and @xmath73 sums are discrete .",
    "consequently , the order parameter @xmath74 vanishes for @xmath75 since @xmath76must remain positive to avoid a divergence of the @xmath77 , @xmath78 contribution to @xmath79 .",

    "instead of adding the purely classical contribution to @xmath125 , the behavior at low @xmath9 may be described by explicitly calculating the first low temperature corrections to @xmath126 .",
    "we find  that these low temperature corrections behave as @xmath127an argumentation identical to the one given below eq.[eq : ft ] yields that these corrections become relevant above a temperature which behaves identical to @xmath128 , only with a different numerical prefactor @xmath129 .",

    "to summarize , we have studied quantum griffiths effects in itinerant magnets with continuous order parameter symmetry , using the itinerant antiferromagnet as the primary example .",

    "griffiths phenomena in itinerant _ _ ferro__magnets require separate attention because mode - coupling effects induce a long - range interaction of the spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this can potentially change the conditions for locally ordered droplets and thus the form of the griffiths effects .",
    "let us comment on measuring the predicted effects .",
    "many of the heavy electron systems displaying magnetic quantum phase transitions have a strong spin anisotropy and are thus better described by ising models . -based intermetallics have a local heisenberg symmetry , but the hybridization between magnetic and conduction electrons is very small .",

    "most promising are @xmath135-transition metal systems with weak spin - orbit interaction and strong hybridization .",
    "a candidate is the @xmath135 heavy fermion system liv@xmath136o@xmath137@xcite where recent experiments did show a broad distribution of relaxation rates @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath138-version of our theory ( @xmath139 ) directly predicts quantum griffiths behavior in disordered thin nanowires@xcite close to the metal - superconductor quantum phase transition@xcite , with direct impact on the conductance fluctuations of these systems .",
    "our results hopefully motivate further the search for new and unconventional behavior in dissipative quantum systems with continuous order parameter symmetry .",
    "this letter has focused on the griffiths region above the dirty critical point .",
