    "there is a complete equivalence of the two - dimensional schrdinger equation for a particle in a hard wall box to microwave billiards @xcite .",
    "a wave function is exactly corresponds to the the electric field component of the tm mode of electromagnetic field : @xmath2 with the same dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this equivalence is turned out very fruitful and test a mass of predictions found in the quantum mechanics of billiards @xcite . in open systems",
    "the probability current density corresponds to the poynting vector .",
    "the last equivalence allowed to test in particular universal current statistics in chaotic billiards @xcite .",
    "moreover if the resonator is non homogeneously filled with ferrite , a similarity to quantum billiards with broken time - reversal symmetry appears @xcite .    in present work",
    "we develop this idea of resonators filled with ferrite to show an equivalence of the maxwell equations to electron in quantum dot ( qd ) with the rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) @xcite .",
    "this interaction is relevant in a two - dimensional electron gas , such as is formed in gaas heterostructures . while spin - orbit scattering in metals is largely due to scattering from the metal ions or from impurities , in a gaas heterostructure",

    "the dominant mechanism for the soi in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is attributed by the rashba term @xcite . using the characteristic scale of qd @xmath6 we rewrite ( [ hsoi ] ) in dimensionless form for @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",

    "such a geometry of the waveguide allows to separate variables @xmath22 and @xmath24 and write @xmath25 then eqs [ me2 ] reduce to @xmath26 combining this equation with the third equation of ( [ me1 ] ) we obtain from ( [ me3 ] ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the two - dimensional laplace operator .    the next task is to exclude @xmath29 and @xmath30 from ( [ me4 ] ) .",
