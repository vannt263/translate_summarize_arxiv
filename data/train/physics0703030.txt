    "fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) is an interesting photo - physical process @xcite that involves transfer of excitation energy from donor to acceptor in a non - radiative fashion .",
    "it has been extensively used in biology as a spectroscopic ruler to study the conformational dynamics of biopolymers in the @xmath6-@xmath7 @xmath8 range .",
    "the rate of non - radiative damping of dye molecules near quencher molecules is found to vary as @xmath4 , where @xmath9 is the distance between the donor and the acceptor . in fret ,",
    "energy is transferred from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule via the dipole - dipole interaction . the matrix element for the interaction",
    "is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transition dipole moments of donor and acceptor .",
    "therefore , the rate of energy transfer , which is proportional to the square of the interaction matrix element varies as @xmath4 .",
    "the frster expression for the rate is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the radiative rate and @xmath15 is the frster radius , which can be expressed as an overlap integral between the donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra as @xmath16 .",
    "the orientation factor @xmath17 takes into account the effect of relative orientation of the donor and acceptor transition dipole moments and is given by @xmath18 . the value of @xmath17 is usually taken to be @xmath19 assuming rapid orientational averaging of the donor within the lifetime of its excited state @xcite .    however , there are reports of deviations from the conventional fret behaviour in the literature .",
    "two possible reasons for this are the breakdown of point dipole approximation , especially for systems with extended transition densities like polymers @xcite and the incomplete orientational averaging within the lifetime of the excited state @xcite .",
    "currently , there is a lot of interest in using nanoparticles @xcite as quenching agents due to their tunable optical properties @xcite .",
    "there have been very interesting observations on energy transfer between the dye fluorescein and a gold nanoparticle of diameter @xmath20 @xmath21 . using double stranded dna as the spacer",
    ", the dye molecule was kept at different fixed distances from the particle and the rate of energy transfer was experimentally determined @xcite .",
    "they found a @xmath5 dependence of the rate on the distance @xmath22 between the dye and the surface of the nanoparticle and have referred to this as nanoparticle surface energy transfer ( nset ) .",
    "such a dependence is of great interest as it would more than double the range of distances that can be measured .",
    "persson and lang ( pl ) @xcite had long ago studied the dissipation of vibrational energy of an oscillating dipole held at a distance @xmath22 above the surface of a semi - infinite metal .",
    "in this case , the energy is transferred to electron - hole ( e - h ) pair excitations in the metal , which form a continuum , having all possible energies from zero to infinity .",
    "for an excitation energy @xmath23 , their density of states is proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "pl found the distance dependence to be @xmath25 ( see also @xcite ) . following this ,",
    "it is suggested @xcite that the observed distance dependence in nset is due to the excitation of e - h pairs in the nanoparticle . in support of this , the authors @xcite point out that plasmonic absorptions have not been observed for a gold nanoparticle of diameter @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "however , unlike a semi - infinite metal , a nanoparticle of such a small size , does not have a continuum of e - h excitations .",
    "the excitations are discrete ( see the excitation spectrum given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] of this paper ) . in view of this",
    ", it would be very interesting to study the distance dependence of nset theoretically",
    ".    there have been attempts to explain the @xmath5 dependence for the case of nanoparticle @xcite . in particular , focus of these papers @xcite is on energy transfer to the plasmons of the nanoparticle and they find a predominantly @xmath4 dependence , though deviations occur at shorter distances .",
    "these calculations do not account for e - h pair excitations . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there are no reports of theoretical calculations which take plasmons as well as e - h excitations of the nanoparticle into account .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the rate of transfer of electronic excitation from an excited fluorescein molecule to a @xmath20 @xmath21 nanoparticle , taking both the e - h pair excitations as well as the plasmon excitations of the nanoparticle into account .",
    "we model the nanoparticle within the jellium model @xcite , and use time dependent local density approximation ( tdlda ) to calculate the excitations of the nanoparticle .",
    "strictly speaking , one should use rpa with the hartree fock approach as the starting point , because in any lda based approach , the single particle energies and the response calculated using them have no fundamental meaning .",
    "however , there have been a number of calculations based on tdlda for the response of a metallic nanoparticle and other systems @xcite .",
    "all these calculations have led to results which agree well with experiments and therefore we use this approach . within this framework",
    ", we do not get the experimentally observed @xmath5 dependence .",
    "therefore , in our opinion , this very interesting experimental observation is , as it stands , unexplained .",
    "perhaps , it may be due to other factors , like transfer through the dna , or the asphericity of the nanoparticle , which are being currently investigated .",
    "it is also to be noted that the distances between the donor and the acceptor in the nset experiment are much greater than the dimensions of the donor and acceptor , making it unlikely that the breakdown of point dipole approximation is responsible for the @xmath5 dependence .",
    "we use the spherical jellium model for the nanoparticle which provides a model system for investigating the response of the conduction electrons in small metal particles @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the positive ions of the metal cluster are replaced by a uniform sphere of positive charge and the density functional formalism within the linear response approximation is used to calculate the response of the cluster to the time dependent external potential .",
    "two kinds of excitations are possible for a metal cluster namely , single particle excitations and plasmon excitations . in a single particle excitation , an electron is excited from an occupied level to an unoccupied level and these are the electron - hole pair excitations .",
    "plasmon excitations are collective oscillations involving many electrons , wherein the electronic charge density oscillates as a whole against the positive background .",
    "we denote the hamiltonian of the nanoparticle as @xmath26 .",
    "the molecule is treated within a single particle model .",
    "an electron which was initially in the orbital @xmath27 is excited to an orbital @xmath28 .",
    "de - excitation of the molecule , in which the electron goes back to @xmath27 may be thought of as a time dependent potential acting on the nanoparticle , given by @xmath29 in the above , @xmath24 is the frequency of the transition corresponding to de - excitation .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath30 one can carry out an expansion of the electrostatic potential at @xmath31 due to a charge distribution at @xmath32 as @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 is the larger ( smaller ) of @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the spherical harmonics . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , it is obvious that the integration over @xmath32 is to be performed over the molecule . as the electron density of the molecule is fully outside the nanoparticle , @xmath36 @xmath39 @xmath37 and hence @xmath40 where @xmath41 thus the perturbation acting on the nanoparticle is a combination of multipole fields of the form @xmath42 for various values of @xmath0 and @xmath43 . the case of such perturbations acting on nanospheres of jellium",
    "is well studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the rate of transfer using the fermi golden rule is : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial ( ground ) and @xmath46 is the final ( excited ) state of the nanoparticle . for a spherically symmetric closed - shell system @xcite , within the jellium model",
    ", the perturbation @xmath42 can only lead to the excitation of the @xmath47 mode in the nanoparticle .",
    "thus , the excitations in the nanoparticle have the same symmetry as the perturbation and the rate simplifies to @xmath48 @xmath49 denotes excited states having quantum numbers @xmath50 .",
    "if the nanoparticle is placed in an oscillatory external field @xmath51 , an induced electronic charge density is set up , which within the linear response theory @xcite is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the density - density correlation function or the polarization propagator . within the random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    ", @xmath54 obeys the following integral equation : @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the independent particle propagator and @xmath57 is the effective two particle interaction @xcite .",
    "the independent particle approximation to the response function @xmath58 , contains the e - h pair excitations only , while the response under rpa , given by @xmath53 includes both the single particle and plasmonic response . the free and rpa response to the external perturbation of the system",
    "is calculated by integrating the external potential over the transition density@xcite .",
    "thus we have @xmath59 and @xmath60 the polarization propagator is related to the strength function , @xmath61 by @xmath62 the rate may be expressed in terms of the strength function @xmath63 as @xmath64 the evaluation of polarization propagator for the independent particle as well as the rpa response allows one to take both the e - h pair excitations as well as the plasmonic excitations into account in the calculation .",
    "we make use of the time dependent local density approximation ( tdlda ) version of the above equations , as this has been found to lead to excellent results .",
    "details of the approach may be found in @xcite .",
    "we have optimized the geometry of fluorescein , using the gaussian03 program , within the dft approximation ( b3lyp-6 - 31 g * ) .",
    "the homo ( @xmath27 ) and lumo ( @xmath28 ) were taken from the calculation for the optimised geometry .",
    "these orbitals were then used to evaluate the matrix elements @xmath65 numerically for all @xmath43 with @xmath0 up to @xmath3 .",
    "a grid within a box of size @xmath66 , within which the molecule was located was used for this purpose .",
    "note that @xmath0 = @xmath1 corresponds to the oscillation of the electrons in the nanoparticle that has the shape of a p - orbital , @xmath0 = @xmath2 that of a d - orbital and @xmath0 = @xmath3 that of an f - orbital .",
    "we assumed an au cluster of @xmath67 atoms which corresponds to a @xmath68 @xmath21 gold nanoparticle and performed the jellium model calculation to evaluate @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the rate was calculated using eq .",
    "( [ ratefinal ] ) , with static but random averaging over all the orientations of the nanoparticle .",
    "thus , we have evaluated the rate of energy transfer from the fluorescein molecule to the @xmath20 @xmath21 gold nanoparticle as a function of distance .",
    "the rate of energy transfer depends on the values of the two terms @xmath65 and @xmath63 .",
    "the first one represents the perturbing potential acting on the nanoparticle due to the dye molecule and the second one is the response of the nanoparticle to the perturbation .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath61 for @xmath71 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes of excitations of the nanoparticle , for the tdlda response using the jellyrpa program of bertsch @xcite . for the calculation ,",
    "we have taken @xmath72 atomic units ( au ) .",
    "the broadening parameter @xmath73 , which determines the width of the single particle peaks was taken to be @xmath74 @xmath75 .",
    "plot of @xmath63 calculated using the single particle and rpa approaches is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath0 = @xmath76 and @xmath3 modes .",
    "the tdlda plot clearly shows peaks corresponding to e - h pair excitations , collective surface plasmon and bulk plasmon excitations .",
    "the numerous narrow spikes at lower energies correspond to e - h pair excitations .",
    "the peak around @xmath77 is the remnant of the surface plasmon and the one around @xmath78 corresponds to the bulk plasmon .",
    "note that the frequency of a surface plasmon mode @xcite is related to that of the bulk plasmon mode as @xmath79 .",
    "the surface plasmon mode is slightly red shifted while the bulk plasmon mode is slightly blue shifted .",
    "the shifts are consistent with previous jellium model calculations @xcite .",
    "the quantities of interest to us , in the calculation of the rate of energy transfer to the nanoparticle are @xmath63 for @xmath71 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with @xmath24 having the value of emission energy of the dye particle , which are given in table 1 for @xmath80 .",
    ".numerical values of @xmath81 for @xmath0 = @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath82 at @xmath83 , the emission energy for fluorescein .",
    "sp stands for single particle . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     after evaluating @xmath65 numerically for all @xmath43 with @xmath0 upto 3 , we evaluated the rates of transfer corresponding to the @xmath0 = @xmath1 , @xmath84 and @xmath3 modes of excitation of the nanoparticle , both for the single particle as well as the tdlda response .",
    "the results for tdlda are shown in fig .",
    "note that the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) and hence the calculations are not valid if the dye penetrates into the electron density of the nanoparticle . moreover , in such a case , overlap effects dominate and one has to think of the dexter mechanism and evaluate the exchange integral .",
    "the rates for @xmath0 = @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes vary with distance as @xmath4 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 as may be seen from the slopes in fig .",
    "then , we evaluated the total rate of transfer , again for single particle as well as tdlda response ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is found from the figure that the single particle rate is actually larger than the tdlda result .",
    "this is because there is intensity borrowing by the collective modes ( bulk and surface plasmons ) from the single particle excitations , resulting in a lower value for @xmath87 in the tdlda calculations , as is clear from table [ table1 ] .",
    "asymptotically , at large distances , it is only the @xmath0 = @xmath1 mode that is important and this leads to the conventional @xmath88 limit for the total rate .",
    "but , at shorter distances , @xmath0 = @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes gain importance leading to deviations from @xmath4 behavior at shorter distances . to make this clearer ,",
    "we fitted the long distance rate with @xmath89 and used the result to calculate the short distance rate . the resultant rate is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , along with the actual rate .",
    "the actual rates are found to be _ slightly higher _ than expected from @xmath88 dependence .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath0 = @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes become important at lower distances .",
    "_ note that the deviations are not such as to give an @xmath90 dependence in the distance range that we study .",
    "_ it is also of interest to note that the @xmath9 dependence is governed by @xmath91 and not by @xmath63 .",
    "use of a different set of values of @xmath92 , or @xmath24 would not change the @xmath9 dependence .",
    "therefore , we conclude that excitation of plasmons or e - h pairs can not lead to the observed experimental data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a distance range from infinity to up to @xmath93 times the radius of the nanoparticle ( for our case , @xmath94 ) , the behavior is found to be @xmath4 . in this range , we too get an @xmath4 dependence , illustrating that inclusion of e - h pair excitations does not affect the result at all . also , it is to be noted that in our calculations , our grid used for numerical integration will penetrate into the nanoparticle for distances less than about @xmath95 so that our approach will break down for closer distances .",
    "we have adopted a spherical jellium model to evaluate both the independent particle and collective response of a metallic nanoparticle to an external time dependent perturbation and used this to evaluate the rates of non - radiative energy transfer from the excited state of a fluorescent dye to the particle .",
    "the rates due to the excitation of @xmath96 and @xmath3 modes of the nanoparticle were found to vary with distances as @xmath4 ,  @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively .",
    "the major contribution to the rate is from the leading @xmath4 term .",
    "the contributions from the other terms are relatively small , except at distances close to @xmath97 , and these make the rate only larger and they are not in a direction as to make the result behave like @xmath5 . thus the experimentally observed @xmath5 dependence can not be explained by considering the excitation of plasmons or e - h pairs of the nanoparticle .",
