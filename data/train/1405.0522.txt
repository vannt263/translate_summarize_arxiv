    "here we relax that assumption , which necessitates keeping track of the total magnon energy on par with the magnon number .",
    "we still , however , suppose that magnon - magnon interactions are sufficiently strong that the magnons remain internally thermalized to a bose - einstein distribution with a well - defined effective temperature @xmath44 and chemical potential @xmath127 ( relative to the magnon - band bottom ) at all times .",
    "we also retain the assumption that cloud and condensate always remain in mutual equilibrium , namely , that @xmath53 vanishes for @xmath169 ( np ) and @xmath224 requires that @xmath132 ( cp ) . in analogy with the condensate and normal - phase spin currents discussed above , we define the condensate and normal - phase energy currents @xmath225 and @xmath226 , respectively , according to eq .  , which simplifies the stability analysis of the cp .",
    "at any time , there now exist two dynamical variables . in np ,",
    "these are @xmath127 and @xmath44 , governed by the implicit , coupled rate equations @xmath227 and @xmath228 ; in cp , @xmath53 and @xmath44 , governed by eqs .   and .",
    "in contrast to the expansion of the magnon current @xmath110 in @xmath53 , eq .",
    "( [ ia ] ) , a simple general analytic expansion of the currents in @xmath44 in either phase is not possible , and we must resort to a numerical treatment .    in general ,",
    "the steady - state temperature @xmath44 and the chemical potential @xmath127 ( or condensate spin density @xmath53 ) in each phase are determined from the stable fixed points of the respective pair of coupled rate equations .",
    "the resultant numerical phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ floating ] .",
    "the energy accompanying angular - momentum transfer into the ferromagnet creates additional heating ( cooling ) when @xmath229 ( phonon temperature ) , which hinders ( facilitates ) condensation relative to the fixed - temperature regime .",
    "in particular , condensation via temperature gradient alone ( i.e. , @xmath230 ) no longer occurs . below the swasing instability ( i.e. , @xmath172 )",
    ", each steady - state solution @xmath132 in np coincides with a solution @xmath128 in cp , indicating the second - order phase transition . above the threshold for swasing , on the other hand , hysteretic regions appear , where , depending on the initial conditions , the solutions flow toward stable fixed points in np or cp .",
    "these features are qualitatively similar to those discussed in the case of a fixed magnon temperature , sec .",
    "[ fmt ] .    in the case of a low temperature gradient ( @xmath231 )",
    ", the incipient condensation may be understood by expanding @xmath150 and @xmath232 in @xmath233 , @xmath234 , and @xmath155 ( all of which are assumed to be much smaller than the ambient temperature ) and solving the steady - state equations to obtain analytic solutions for @xmath44 and @xmath53 . when @xmath235 ( denoted by @xmath218 in fig .",
    "[ floating ] ) , no condensate solution exists ; increasing @xmath155 beyond this critical point , the condensate density continuously increases from zero .",
    "( note that the same bias @xmath155 at @xmath218 describes the onset of condensation under zero temperature bias both in the fixed- and floating - temperature regimes . ) as in the fixed - temperature case , furthermore , when @xmath236 , unstable analytic solutions for @xmath53 appear , suggesting the presence of hysteresis when the temperature gradient is restored ; correspondingly , ( two ) critical points @xmath177 and @xmath237 manifest under a sufficient temperature bias at the swasing instability .    the above linearized treatment for the currents @xmath150 and @xmath232 , however , fails to capture the detailed phase behavior when @xmath238 .",
    "there , the spin and energy fluxes that are quadratic in thermal bias are essential for generating the full structure of the phase boundaries depicted in fig .  [ floating ] .",
    "in particular , we see that the condensate is suppressed under large temperature biases of both signs : when @xmath239 , the magnons injected by the normal metal are relatively cold but there are ultimately too few of them to precipitate a condensate ; when @xmath240 , on the other hand , the magnon injection rate is high but they are too hot to condense . only at intermediate thermal biases",
    "do we reach a compromise between the magnon injection rate and the energy they carry , which allows for a stable condensate to form .",
    "we studied the steady - state behavior of an insulating magnet driven by the combination of a thermal gradient and spin - transfer torque across its interface with an adjacent normal metal .",
    "agitated by the interfacial magnon - electron and bulk magnon - lattice interactions , our theory describes the emergent nonlinear coherent motion of the condensate ( in a quasiequilibrium with the thermal cloud of magnons ) , demonstrating a surprisingly rich dynamic phase diagram .",
    "the stability analysis of the driven coherent motion depends crucially on the form of the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "our detailed analysis was specific to an easy - plane magnetic film subjected to a large out - of - plane magnetic field ( such that the magnetic ground state is nondegenerate ) . in the case of other geometries and magnetic anisotropies ,",
    "the phase diagram can be altered .",
    "furthermore , in other configurations , where spin - rotational symmetry is broken in all directions , three - magnon scattering processes would violate magnon conservation , which is built into our model .",
    "we nevertheless expect that the essential nature of the first- and second - order instabilities predicted in our model to be generic , although the details would depend on the specific experimental realization .",
    "we emphasize that one of the key features predicted by our theory is a possibility of a continuous formation of the condensate in the presence of a temperature gradient alone , which may be less sensitive to the particular magnetic orientation than the more familiar instabilities invoked by a spin - transfer torque .",
    "the presence of coherently - precessing magnetic phases may manifest experimentally in a variety of ways .",
    "collective magnetic modes driven by dc currents may be detected either by their microwave signatures or differential dc response ( both in the charge and thermal sectors ) in the steady state , similarly to the conventional spin - transfer torque instabilities.@xcite the thermal properties of the magnon condensates , in particular , may differ dramatically from the normal phase , if , for example , the lateral propagation of heat in the plane of our heterostructure can be carried collectively by magnetic dynamics . in addition , unlike thermal magnons that generally travel diffusively with a microscopic spin - diffusion length , low - frequency condensates can carry spin signals over macroscopic distances.@xcite such collective and nonlocal transport signatures of condensation warrant further studies , both theoretically and experimentally .",
