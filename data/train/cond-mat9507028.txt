    "in mesoscopic samples of disordered normal metals at low temperatures it is possible to observe a quantum correction to the classical boltzmann conductance @xcite . here mesoscopic means that within the sample , the interaction of a single electron with other degrees of freedom , such as other electrons , phonons , magnetic impurities etc .",
    ", can be neglected .",
    "such a situation can be realised in semiconductor and metal nanostructures cooled to milli - kelvin temperatures .",
    "the origin of the quantum correction is quantum interference between time reversed scattering paths .",
    "( by `` time reversed path ''",
    "we mean that the electron follows the same trajectory but in the opposite sense . )",
    "the correction is sensitive to the breaking of spin rotation symmetry and is suppressed by the breaking of time reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the spin orbit interaction has the important property of breaking spin rotation symmetry while preserving time reversal symmetry .    as an example , the two probe conductance @xmath0 of a quasi - one dimensional mesoscopic wire can be expressed in the form @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the classical conductance of the wire is @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of scattering channels and @xmath5 is the ratio of the length @xmath6 of the wire to the elastic mean free path @xmath7 . in the absence of an applied magnetic field the quantum correction @xmath8 , also called the `` weak localisation correction '' , is @xmath9 .",
    "more exactly , in the diffusive regime @xmath10 we have @xmath11 if the spin orbit interaction is negligible and @xmath12 if it is not . in a magnetic field",
    "sufficient to break time reversal symmetry the quantum correction is suppressed and becomes @xmath13 .",
    "more recently , a quantum correction to the classical conductance of a disordered mesoscopic normal superconducting ( ns ) junction was observed @xcite .",
    "the correction is most pronounced in junctions where the transparency @xmath14 of the schottky barrier at the ns interface is low @xmath15 and the length of the normal part is such that @xmath16 . under these conditions a phenomenon known as `` reflectionless tunnelling '' occurs . in @xcite",
    "it is suggested that quantum interference is responsible for this effect .",
    "the type of scattering paths involved in this quantum interference contain a segment where the path of an electron ( hole ) incident on the ns boundary is subsequently retraced by an andreev reflected hole ( electron . )",
    "the enhancement of the junction conductance can be as much as several times greater than the classical conductance .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of the coupling of the spin and spatial degrees of freedom of the electrons by an appreciable spin orbit interaction has on this quantum correction .",
    "as previously mentioned , this has an important effect on the quantum correction in a normal metal .",
    "as the electron diffuses through the metal , the spin orbit coupling causes a simultaneous diffusion of the direction of its spin .",
    "interference between different spin states is now possible and this modifies the interference responsible for the weak localisation correction . what role then , if any , does this spin diffusion play in the ns junction ?    at first sight the answer to this question would be appear to be none at all .",
    "the argument is as follows : the spin rotations of an electron and an andreev reflected hole , which traverse time reversed paths , are exactly opposite and cancel each other . since interference between scattering processes involving such paths is believed to be responsible for the quantum correction , it should be insensitive to the spin orbit interaction . as we shall demonstrate below this",
    "is too simple and in fact the spin orbit interaction does affect the quantum correction to the classical conductance of an ns junction .",
    "we have found the flaw in the argument is that it is not only processes involving electrons and holes traversing time reversed paths which are responsible for the quantum correction . processes in which electrons and holes traverse loops in the same sense , what we shall call here identical paths , also contribute and in this case the spin rotations do not cancel each other .",
    "the most striking consequence of the existence of interference involving such paths is that the quantum correction is sensitive to the spin orbit interaction even in a magnetic field .    in the normal metal",
    "we have seen that the quantum correction to the classical conductance is suppressed when time reversal symmetry is broken in an applied magnetic field .",
    "this is easily understood since the symmetry between time reversed paths is broken when the time reversal symmetry is broken . in the ns junction however , the contribution of identical paths is still present even in a magnetic field ; the electron and hole carry opposite charges , and so the aharonov - bohm phases that they accumulate as they follow such trajectories cancel . moreover , since the electron and hole undergo identical spin rotations , as they follow identical paths , this contribution is sensitive to the spin diffusion induced by the spin orbit interaction .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sections",
    "[ bdg ] -[formulae ] we deal with some necessary preliminaries : the bogolubov - de gennes equations , scattering theory and conductance formulae for the ns junction , generalising the standard theory to take into account the spin orbit interaction .    in section [ quasiball ]",
    "we investigate a quasi - ballistic ns junction , that is to say a junction whose length is shorter than the mean free path but long enough so that its scattering matrix is well described by a certain random phase approximation @xcite .",
    "we express the junction conductance @xmath17 as a sum of two terms @xmath18 a classical conductance @xmath19 and a quantum correction @xmath20 due to quantum interference .",
    "we determine the quantum correction for the four ensembles listed in table [ table1 ] and the results are presented in table [ table2 ] . in section [ interp ]",
    "we present a semiclassical interpretation of these results which permits us to identify the type of scattering paths which interfere to produce the quantum correction . in agreement with ref @xcite",
    ", we find that there is an important contribution due to interference between processes involving electrons and holes traversing time reversed paths , but that there is also a second contribution from processes involving electrons and holes traversing identical paths .",
    "we explain why this contribution is sensitive to the breaking of spin rotation symmetry but not to the breaking of time reversal symmetry .    after reaching a firm understanding of the quasi - ballistic junction we consider the diffusive regime , looking first at junctions without a schottky barrier at the ns interface in section [ diffjunc ] . in zero magnetic field",
    "the quantum correction is known to be of @xmath9 @xcite . in a magnetic field",
    "the authors of ref @xcite find that the correction though smaller is still @xmath9 .",
    "the effect of the spin orbit interaction was not considered in ref @xcite and so we repeat their calculation taking it into account .",
    "we find that breaking spin rotation symmetry multiplies the correction by a factor of minus one half , regardless of whether time reversal symmetry is broken or not .    in section [ reftun ]",
    "we discuss the dramatic enhancement of the junction conductance , known as `` reflectionless tunnelling , '' which is observable when @xmath15 and @xmath16 . under these conditions",
    "the contribution of time reversed paths is @xmath2 and dominates that of identical paths which is @xmath9 so that the reflectionless tunnelling effect is , in a first approximation , insensitive to the spin orbit interaction .",
    "this conclusion has been confirmed by carrying out a numerical simulation of a junction under the relevant conditions .",

    "we treat the scattering at the ns interface within andreev s approximation .",
    "we suppose that any impurities in the system are in the region indicated by shading in figure 1 , and we make the approximation that the magnetic field is zero everywhere except in this disordered region .",
    "this is reasonable for the low fields of interest which affect the interference between electrons and holes in the normal part of the junction .      to facilitate the explanation of the formalism ,",
