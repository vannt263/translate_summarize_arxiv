    "the rotor - router walk is the latter and most frequently used name of the model introduced independently in different areas during the last two decades .",
    "the previous names `` self - directing walk '' @xcite and `` eulerian walkers '' @xcite reflected its connection with the theory of self - organized criticality @xcite and the abelian sandpile model @xcite .",
    "cooper and spencer @xcite called the model `` p - machine '' after propp who proposed the rotor mechanism as the way to derandomize the internal diffusion - limited aggregation . later on ,",
    "several theorems in this direction have been proved in @xcite .",
    "holroyd and propp @xcite proved a closeness of expected values of many quantities for simple random and rotor - router walks .",
    "applications of the model to multiprocessor systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "recent works on the rotor - router walk address the questions on recurrence @xcite , escape rates @xcite and transitivity of the rotor - routing action @xcite .    the connection between the abelian sandpiles , euler circuits and the rotor - router model observed in the original paper @xcite was the subject of the rigorous mathematical survey @xcite .",
    "an essential idea highlighted in the survey is the consideration of the rotor - routing action of the sandpile group on spanning trees in parallel with rotor - routing on unicycles .",
    "the rotor - router walk started from an arbitrary rotor configuration on a finite sink - free directed graph @xmath0 enters after a finite number of steps into an euler circuit ( euler tour ) and remains there forever .",
    "the length of the circuit is the number of edges of the digraph .",
    "each recurrent rotor state can be represented by a connected spanning subgraph @xmath1 which contains as many edges as vertices and contains a unique directed cycle @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the rotor - router walk requires the location of the walker at a vertex @xmath2 belonging to the cycle .",
    "the pair @xmath3 is called unicycle ( see section ii for precise definition ) .",
    "thus , the walk passes the periodic sequence of unicycles .",
    "a shortest cycle in the unicycle is the two - step path from a given vertex to one of nearest neighbors and back .",
    "we call the cycles of length 2 `` dimers '' by analogy with lattice dimers covering two neighboring vertices .",
    "longer cycles involve more than two vertices and form directed contours .",
    "the euler tour passes sequentially unicycles containing cycles of different length .",
    "the order in which dimers and contours alternate depends on the structure of the initial unicycle . ascribing @xmath4 to each step producing a contour and @xmath5 to a dimer",
    ", we obtain for a `` displacement '' @xmath6 after @xmath7 time - steps the picture ( fig.[delta1 ] ) resembling the symmetric random walk .",
    "nevertheless , the process actually is neither completely symmetric nor completely random .     for the euler tour of 40000 steps.,width=453 ]",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to investigate statistical properties of unicycles as they appear in course of the euler tour .",
    "we will see that the events `` dimer '' and `` contour '' correlate along the sequence and an excess of the number of dimers over contours is an invariant characterizing topology of the surface where the rotor - router walk occurs .",
    "specifically , in the limit of large square lattice with periodic boundary conditions we find the expected number of dimers in the euler tour and an analytical expression for the correlations dimer - dimer and contour - contour at two successive moments of time in the circuit .",
    "we consider a closed loop encircling a plane domain and prove that the rotor - router walk passed each directed edge of the domain contains the number of dimers exceeding that of contours exactly by @xmath8 .",
    "this property does not hold for surfaces of the non - zero genus .",
    "in addition to statistics of unicycles , we consider the mean - square displacement of the rotor - router walker in the recurrent state and argue that it yields to the diffusion law with the diffusion coefficient depending on dynamic rules and boundary conditions .",

    "a subgraph @xmath14 of a digraph @xmath0 is a digraph with vertex set @xmath15 and edge set @xmath16 being a subset of @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 . in this case",
    "we write @xmath19 . if @xmath16 contains no outgoing edges from a fixed vertex , that vertex is a sink .",
    "the oriented tree with sink @xmath12 is a digraph , which is acyclic and whose every non - sink vertex @xmath20 has only one outgoing edge .",

    "a connected subgraph of an oriented graph @xmath0 , in which every vertex has one outgoing edge , is called unicycle .",
    "the unicycle contains exactly one directed cycle .",
    "an euler circuit ( or euler tour ) in a directed graph is a path that visits each directed edge exactly once .",
    "if such a path exists , the graph is called eulerian digraph .",
    "a digraph is strongly connected if for any two distinct vertices @xmath12 , @xmath13 there are directed paths from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and from @xmath13 to @xmath12 .",

    "the state of the system ( single walker + medium ) at any moment of time is given by the pair @xmath33 of the rotor configuration @xmath29 and the position of the chip @xmath21 . according to arguments in @xcite ,",
    "the rotor - router walk started from an arbitrary initial state @xmath33 passes transient states and enters into a recurrent state , continuing the motion in the limiting cycle which is the eulerian circuit of the graph .",
    "the basic results about the rotor - router model on the eulerian graphs can be summarized as two propositions .",
    "_ proposition 1 _ [ @xcite , theorem 3.8 ] let @xmath0 be a strongly connected digraph . then @xmath33 is a recurrent single - chip - rotor state on @xmath0 if and only if it is a unicycle .",

    "in contrast to recurrent states , they appear at the initial stage of evolution up to the moment when the system enters into the eulerian tour .    _ proposition 2 _ [ @xcite , lemma 4.9 ] let @xmath0 be an eulerian digraph with @xmath34 edges .",
    "let @xmath33 be a unicycle in @xmath0 .",
    "if one iterates the rotor - router operation @xmath34 times starting from @xmath33 , the chip traverses an euler tour of @xmath0 , each rotor makes one full turn , and the state of the system returns to @xmath33 .",
    "below , we specify the structure of graph @xmath0 as the square @xmath35 lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( torus )",
    ". then the number of outgoing edges is @xmath36 for all vertices @xmath37 .",
    "we consider two ways of labeling of four directions of the rotor @xmath38 corresponding to the clockwise and cross order of routing .",
    "for the clockwise routing , we put @xmath39 , for the cross one @xmath40 .",
    "sometimes , we will use the notation @xmath41 for the edge outgoing from @xmath12 in direction @xmath41 .    by _",
    "proposition 1 _ , each recurrent state @xmath33 of the rotor - routing process is a unicycle on @xmath0 . replacing all arrows of the rotor configuration @xmath29 by directed bonds",
    ", we obtain a cycle - rooted spanning tree of @xmath0 .",
    "it consists of a single cycle of length @xmath42 ( i.e. @xmath42 directed bonds connecting @xmath42 vertices ) and the spanning cycle - free subgraph whose edges are directed towards the cycle . if @xmath43 , the cycle is `` dimer '' , if @xmath44 , the cycle is `` contour '' oriented clockwise or anticlockwise .    by _ proposition 2 _ ,",
    "the walker started from unicycle @xmath33 traverses an euler tour which has the length @xmath45 in our case of @xmath46 torus .",
    "the questions arise how many of @xmath34 unicycles passed during the euler tour contain a dimer ( contour ) ?",
    "what is the probability that the unicycle obtained on @xmath7-th step of the euler tour contains a dimer ( contour ) ?",
    "consider the recurrent state @xmath33 and define a random variable @xmath47 as @xmath48 we are interested in the average @xmath49 over all possible uniformly distributed recurrent states and over all directions @xmath38 .",
    "we write the unicycle @xmath33 as @xmath50 separating off the edge @xmath41 and the spanning tree @xmath51 obtained from edges outgoing from vertices of the set @xmath52 . by the definition of euler tour , all @xmath34 unicycles following the initial unicycle @xmath50 are different .",

    "now , we fix a vertex @xmath53 and its outgoing edge @xmath54 .",
    "if one scans over all possible initial spanning trees @xmath51 , then the trees @xmath55 also scan over all possible configurations .",
    "so , the uniform distribution of @xmath51 induces the uniform distribution of @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 is the probability that the edge @xmath54 taken uniformly with @xmath57 and added to the uniformly distributed spanning trees creates a dimer . due to the translation invariance",
    ", this average does not depend on the position of the initial vertex @xmath12 .    to make these arguments more explicit ,",
    "consider all possible unicycles @xmath58 for fixed vertex @xmath13 and arrow @xmath54 .",
    "first , we take @xmath59 , choosing the arrow at @xmath13 directed _ north_. the set of unicycles @xmath60 can be divided into two subsets @xmath61 and @xmath62 where the first subset corresponds to spanning trees @xmath55 containing a selected bond incident to @xmath13 from above .",
    "the tree @xmath55 has the root in @xmath13 , so this bond is directed down . the selected bond and arrow @xmath59 form together a vertical dimer with the lower end in @xmath13 . in the subset @xmath62 ,",
    "the place of the selected bond in each tree @xmath55 is empty , so the arrow @xmath59 belongs to a contour .",
    "considering similar subsets for other directions @xmath63 with selected bonds of the trees @xmath55 incident to @xmath13 from right , down and left , we can write the average probability to find a dimer incident to @xmath13 as @xmath64 where summation is over all @xmath57 and @xmath65 is the total number of non - rooted spanning trees .",
    "now , let us take the sum over all @xmath13 in the numerator and denominator using the uniformity of vertices of the torus .",
    "then , the numerator will be the doubled number of edges of the spanning tree @xmath66 multiplied by @xmath65 because each edge is taken in two directions .",
    "the denominator will be @xmath67 .",
    "the number of edges of the torus is @xmath68 , the number of edges of the spanning tree @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the probability of a dimer @xmath70 is @xmath71 the probability of a contour is @xmath72 .    in the limit @xmath73 , @xmath74 , we obtain @xmath75 . in spite of this simple symmetric result ,",
    "the distribution of the random value @xmath47 is not trivial .",
    "we will return to this question in the next section .",
    "now consider the correlations dimer - dimer and dimer - contour at two successive moments of time in the euler tour .",
    "in the case of clockwise routing where the directions of each arrow alternate @xmath76@xmath77@xmath78@xmath79 , two successive directions of an arrow at a fixed vertex always form the angle @xmath80 . for the cross routing ( @xmath76@xmath78@xmath77@xmath79 ) , the rotations @xmath76@xmath78 and @xmath77@xmath79 form the angle @xmath81 , whereas the rotations @xmath78@xmath77 and @xmath79@xmath76 form the angle @xmath80 .",
    "the correlations we are going to determine have the following origin . consider for example a particle arriving to vertex @xmath12 from above at the time step @xmath7 .",
    "if the arrow at @xmath12 is directed _ north _ in the preceding moment of time , a vertical dimer is created with the lower vertex in @xmath12 . if one uses the clockwise dynamics , the next step is the rotation of the arrow at @xmath12 to _ east_. assume that there is an arrow at time @xmath7 directed to @xmath12 from right to left .",
    "then , the horizontal dimer is created at the time step @xmath82 with the left vertex in @xmath12 . the probability to get two dimers at moments",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath82 is the correlation @xmath83 .",
    "the arguments used for the derivation @xmath70 and @xmath84 show that the correlations @xmath83 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 at two successive time - steps can be related with the probability to find two adjacent edges of the square lattice occupied ( or not occupied ) by bonds of the spanning tree @xmath88 .    specifically in the considered example , we must enumerate unicycles @xmath89 with the vertical dimer having the lower end in @xmath12 . the spanning tree @xmath51 of the unicycle",
    "@xmath89 has the root @xmath12 and two fixed bonds , @xmath90 directed to @xmath12 from above and @xmath91 directed to @xmath12 from the right .",
    "the presence of the root in @xmath12 implies that all bonds of the tree @xmath51 are globally oriented towards the vertex @xmath12 .",
    "the enumeration of spanning trees @xmath51 obeying the above conditions can be performed in three steps .",
    "first , we consider non - oriented spanning tree @xmath88 with the selected non - oriented bonds @xmath92 and @xmath93 on the places of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "second , we put the root in @xmath12 , giving the necessary orientation to bonds @xmath90 and @xmath91 and supplying other bonds with the global orientation towards @xmath12 .",
    "third , we use the kirhhoff theorem according to which the number of spanning trees does not depend on the location of the root .",
    "this allows us to shift the root to infinity and restore the translation invariance in the limit @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the alternative way of calculations would consist in fixing the oriented bonds @xmath90 and @xmath91 and the location of the root in @xmath12 .",
    "however , the kirhhoff theorem does not allow the translation of the root in the presence of oriented bonds .",
    "then , the lack of translation invariance makes all calculations much more difficult .",
    "we fix a vertex @xmath94 and its two neighbors on the square lattice @xmath95 and @xmath96",

    "define the probabilities @xmath99 obviously , @xmath100 and @xmath101 due to symmetry .",
    "the calculation of probabilities of fixed spanning tree configurations is a standard procedure , which uses the green functions and so called defect matrices ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in our case , it gives @xmath102 where the matrices @xmath103 , @xmath0 are @xmath104 and the defect matrices @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are @xmath108    defect matrices define the locations of bonds @xmath109 and @xmath110 which form angles @xmath80 or @xmath81 . in the first case we add index @xmath111 to the notations of probabilities , and index @xmath112 for the second case . using the explicit values for the green functions given in appendix , we obtain in the limit @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xmath113 for the case ( a ) , and @xmath114 for the case ( b ) .",
