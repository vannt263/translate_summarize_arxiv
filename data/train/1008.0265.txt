    "a large volume of the universe ( including interstellar and intergalactic space ) is filled with hot , tenuous plasmas .",
    "coulomb collisions between charged particles rarely occur in these plasmas and the plasma dynamics are dominated by collective phenomena involving particles and electromagnetic fields ( e.g. , plasma oscillations ) .",
    "hence , such plasmas are known as collisionless plasmas . even in collisionless plasmas ,",
    "some kinds of `` shocks '' occur .",
    "these shocks generally have very complex formation mechanisms that involve various kinetic processes , including electrostatic instabilities , electromagnetic instabilities , and compression of background magnetic fields .",
    "the shocks driven in supernova remnants ( snrs ) are considered to be collisionless ones .",
    "snr shocks propagate in the interstellar medium , which has weak magnetic fields of typically @xmath4 g . in the context of shocks in magnetized plasmas ,",
    "the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath5 , is frequently expressed in terms of the magnetization parameter or the sigma parameter , which is defined as the ratio of the magnetic energy density to the bulk kinetic energy density of the upstream plasma ( both are measured in the shock rest frame ) . for nonrelativistic cases ,",
    "it is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electron number density in the upstream plasma , @xmath8 is the electron mass , @xmath9 is the ion mass , @xmath10 is the shock speed , and @xmath1 is the alfvn mach number .",
    "for example , for the shock in sn1006 ( except the north - west region ) , @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 km s@xmath14 were inferred @xcite so that @xmath15 .",
    "the recently discovered ` youngest ' snr g1.9 + 0.3 is considered to have a shock velocity of @xmath16 km s@xmath14 @xcite ; assuming that @xmath17 @xmath12 gives @xmath18 .",
    "the sigma generally lies in the range @xmath19 for shocks in young snrs ; these shocks are thus very low-@xmath20 shocks ( or , equivalently , very high alfvn mach number shocks ) .",
    "magnetized shocks have been extensively investigated , especially perpendicular shocks in which the background magnetic field is perpendicular to the shock normal .",
    "the structure of perpendicular shocks in the supercritical regime ( @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ) is known to some extent : a fraction of the incoming ions are reflected at the shock front ( called the ` ramp ' ) and the reflected ions form a slightly dense region , referred to as the ` foot ' , in front of the ramp .",
    "the ions also accumulate immediately behind the ramp and generate a strong magnetic field there , which is called the ( magnetic ) ` overshoot ' . over the last decade ,",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations that can model the kinetic dynamics of both electrons and ions have been performed to investigate high - mach - number perpendicular shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , several two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations have also been performed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , most simulations have been conducted for relatively strong background magnetic fields ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) .",
    "it is thus desirable to perform simulations for weaker background fields .    on the other hand",
    ", it was recently demonstrated that certain kinds of collisionless shocks can occur even in unmagnetized plasmas at relativistic shock speeds by performing two- or three - dimensional ( 3d ) pic simulations @xcite . in these shocks , the beam  weibel instability ( or filamentation instability ) is driven in the transition region of the shocks between the counterstreaming electron ",
    "positron beams in pair plasmas or between the counterstreaming ion beams in electron  ion plasmas and generates strong magnetic fields there .",
    "these generated fields provide an effective dissipation mechanism for collisionless shock formation and are hence often referred to as `` weibel - mediated shocks . ''",
    "[ note that the beam  weibel instability is driven by the counterstreaming beams ( c.f . * ? ? ? * ) and it differs from the ordinary weibel instability , which is driven by a temperature anisotropy @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . ] these shocks can be driven by relativistic phenomena , such as gamma - ray bursts and their afterglows @xcite , jets from active galactic nuclei , and pulsar winds @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in our previous paper @xcite that this kind of shock can form in unmagnetized electron ",
    "ion plasmas even at nonrelativistic speeds .",
    "the beam  weibel instability can also be important in weakly magnetized shocks .",
    "as was shown in our previous paper , the magnetic field generated by the ion beam  weibel instability reaches a few percent of the upstream bulk kinetic energy and this value is much higher than the background magnetic field around typical snr shocks .",
    "therefore , the ion beam  weibel instability may play an important role in the formation of weakly magnetized shocks .",
    "magnetized shocks have been extensively investigated by 1d simulations .",
    "however , 1d simulations can not consider the beam  weibel instability because its wave vector is perpendicular to the flow direction .",
    "therefore , it is essential to perform multidimensional simulations to investigate the formation process of weakly magnetized nonrelativistic shocks .",
    "collisionless shocks are also considered sites of particle acceleration . in particular ,",
    "cosmic - rays with energies below @xmath25 ev are considered to be accelerated in snr shocks .",
    "indeed , recent x - ray observations revealed that electrons are accelerated to energies of @xmath26 ev in several young snrs @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that first - order fermi acceleration or diffusive shock acceleration is the acceleration mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is currently not possible to determine the fraction of thermal plasma particles that are injected into the diffusive shock acceleration process ( this is known as the injection problem ) . for electron injection in quasi - perpendicular shocks",
    ", the shock surfing acceleration has been investigated as an injection mechanism or even as an efficient acceleration mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , several researchers have recently shown that the shock surfing acceleration process is in fact inefficient in 2d ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that it is efficient in 1d because of the symmetry of the system .",
    "instead , @xcite showed that another acceleration process can operate in 2d in which a fraction of electrons are reflected in the foot region by small - scale electrostatic waves generated by the buneman instability .",
    "they are then accelerated by the motional electric field as well as being directly accelerated by the electric field when they resonate with the electrostatic waves .",
    "electrons can be accelerated up to about the upstream ion bulk energy by this mechanism .",
    "thus , multidimensional effects can play an essential role in the acceleration / injection mechanism .",
    "in addition , collisionless shocks can be sites of magnetic field amplification / generation .",
    "recent x - ray observations suggest that magnetic fields of the order of hundreds of microgauss or even milligauss may be generated in the vicinity of snr shocks @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for this magnetic field amplification , including a nonresonant instability driven by high - energy particles accelerated in shocks @xcite and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence behind shocks @xcite .",
    "the mechanism may be related with the microscopic kinetic processes associated with shock formation itself ; it should in principle be possible to investigate this by performing large - scale pic simulations .    in this study , we investigate the formation and structure of perpendicular shocks for very low @xmath20 and the processes responsible for particle acceleration and magnetic field generation by performing 2d pic simulation , which can appropriately model the beam  weibel instability .",
    "because of the capability of the computer , we used a reduced ion - to - electron mass ratio and a shock speed ( @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the speed of light ) that is much higher than realistic ones for snrs ( @xmath29 ) in the simulation .",
    "we investigated collisionless shocks in electron ",
    "ion plasmas with weak background magnetic fields by performing a 2d pic simulation .",
    "the simulation code is a relativistic , electromagnetic , pic code with two spatial and three velocity dimensions developed based on a standard method described by @xcite .",
    "the basic equations of the simulation are maxwell s equations and the ( relativistic ) equation of motion for particles . in the following , we regard the simulation plane as the @xmath30 plane and we take the @xmath31-axis to be perpendicular to the plane .",
    "we take @xmath32 to be the unit of time and the electron skin depth @xmath33 to be the unit of length , where @xmath34 is the electron plasma frequency defined for the electron number density in the far upstream region , @xmath7 .",
    "the units for electric and magnetic fields are @xmath35 .    in the simulation , a collisionless shock",
    "is driven according to the `` injection method . ''",
    "there are two walls , one on the left - hand side ( smaller @xmath36 ) and the other on the right - hand side ( larger @xmath36 ) of the simulation box and these walls reflect particles specularly . initially , both electrons and ions are loaded uniformly in the region between the two walls with a bulk velocity of @xmath37 in the @xmath38-direction .",
    "the electrons and ions have equal temperatures in the upstream region . in the early stages of the simulation , particles near the right wall",
    "are reflected by the wall and then interact with incoming particles ( i.e. , the upstream plasma ) .",
    "this interaction generates some instability and eventually a collisionless shock forms .",
    "the frame of the simulation is the rest frame of the shock downstream ; the shock propagates from right to left in the downstream rest frame .",
    "we consider a perpendicular shock in this paper ; the initial magnetic field , @xmath5 , is in the @xmath39-direction ( i.e. , in the plane ) and its strength is determined by the sigma .",
    "however , since the shock speed is unknown before performing the simulation , in the following , the sigma is defined in the simulation frame with an upstream bulk velocity @xmath37 instead of the shock speed @xmath10 as @xmath40 however , the difference between these two sigmas is not large . with this definition of the sigma",
    ", the magnetic field strength in the simulation frame is given by @xmath41^{1/2 } ( v / c ) b_*$ ] .",
    "the initial electric field , @xmath42 , is determined so that it vanishes in the plasma rest frame ( i.e. , the upstream frame ) ; this requirement causes the motional electric field in the simulation frame , @xmath43 , in the @xmath31-direction .",
    "the boundary conditions for both the particles and the electromagnetic field are periodic in the @xmath39-direction .",
    "we performed a simulation for a sigma of @xmath44 .",
    "as mentioned above , we use a reduced ion mass of @xmath45 and a bulk velocity of @xmath46 .",

    "the physical dimensions of the simulation box are @xmath49 and thus the size of a cell is @xmath50 .",
    "the electron and ion temperatures are equal and are given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the thermal velocities are thus given by @xmath53 for the electrons and @xmath54 for the ions .",
    "for these parameters , we have @xmath55 , the alfvn speed @xmath56 ( thus , @xmath57 ) , and the plasma beta @xmath58 ( i.e. , it is a high - beta plasma ) .",
    "the larmor radii of the electrons and ions calculated for the background field and the upstream bulk velocity are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : ni_dev ] shows the time evolution of the ion number density averaged over the @xmath39-direction .",
    "the shock transition region , or the `` shock front '' , appears as a steep increase in the number density .",
    "the shock structure and its propagation speed abruptly change around @xmath61 .",
    "this is because the shock structure undergoes a transition from an unmagnetized shock to a magnetized shock .",
    "indeed , the structure for @xmath62 is essentially the same as those of weibel - mediated shocks in unmagnetized plasmas @xcite , as discussed below .",
    "the transition time is of the order of the gyration time of the ions in the background field , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the ion cyclotron frequency . for the unmagnetized shock ( @xmath65 ) ,",
    "the shock speed measured in the downstream frame is @xmath66 . for the magnetized shock ( @xmath67 )",
    ", it becomes @xmath68 and that in the upstream frame and the alfvn mach number are given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "thus , the sigma defined for the shock velocity is given by @xmath71 in this case .",
    "the shock speeds obtained here may have small uncertainties because they were obtained by eye - fitting the figure and also they may not be in the steady state yet .",
    "since the formation of an unmagnetized shock is a consequence of the initial conditions and we are interested in the magnetized shock in this study , we mainly focus on the magnetized shock below .",

    "note that there are filamentary structures , which can not be observed in 1d simulations , in the upstream leading edge of the shock transition region ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the filament radius is typically approximately equal to the ion inertial length , which is the same as those in the `` weibel - mediated '' shocks in unmagnetized electron ",

    "figure  [ fig : profiles](b ) shows the root mean square of each magnetic field component together with the total magnetic field strength .",
    "this structure is similar to the well - known structure of supercritical perpendicular shocks in 1d ; the ` ramp ' is at @xmath77 and there is an extended ` foot ' region in @xmath80 as well as an ` overshoot ' region in @xmath81 .",
    "it is evident that strong magnetic fields are generated in both the shock transition region ( or the overshoot ) and the downstream region .",

    "it is observed that a fraction of ions are reflected at @xmath77 ( i.e. , the ramp ) and then gyrate back downstream with slight acceleration forming the foot structure .",
    "this is a well - known characteristic of supercritical shocks and has been observed in many numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the reflected ions are further divided into two populations : those streaming upstream measured in the shock rest frame and those streaming downstream .",

    "it is evident that the downstream tangled magnetic field is mainly generated by the current filaments in @xmath192 .",
    "the filaments have typical sizes of @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the ion inertial length , which is slightly larger than the filament size in the foot region .",
    "this can be explained by current filaments coalescing downstream of the foot region .",
    "some of the current filaments have a complex coaxial structure in that they are surrounded by return and anti - return currents .",
    "coalescence of current filaments that carry a current in the @xmath36-direction in the foot region is inhibited due to the dimensionality of the simulation , while current filaments in the @xmath31-direction can merge with each other ( c.f .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the current filaments in the @xmath31-direction are not affected by instabilities in the current direction , such as the kink instability .",
    "therefore , the current structures in the foot and downstream regions may still differ in three dimensions .",
    "it is interesting to note the evolution of the system before the effect of the background magnetic field becomes significant ( i.e. , @xmath201 ) . in this period",
    ", the plasma is effectively unmagnetized and another kind of shock , namely an unmagnetized shock , appears .",
    "figures  [ fig : particles_early ] and [ fig : ni_prof_early ] respectively show the evolution of the ions in the @xmath36@xmath202 phase space and that of the ion number density . at a very early time ( @xmath203 ) , the incoming ions and the ions reflected by the wall at @xmath204 form a counterstreaming beam system and the number density in the overlapping region simply becomes twice the upstream number density .",
    "the two populations then start to interact ( @xmath205 ) and the density on the right side of the overlapping region increases .",
    "as shown below , this interaction is due to the magnetic field generated by the ion beam  weibel instability in the overlapping region that deflects the ions ; this provides a kind of dissipation mechanism . at a later time ( @xmath206 ) ,",
    "the effect of the background magnetic field becomes important and incoming ions start to accumulate around @xmath207 .",
    "most of the ions that are initially reflected by the wall gyrate back downstream due to the background magnetic field by @xmath208 .",
    "instead , at @xmath209 , another reflected ion population appears around @xmath210 ; the ions in this population have been newly reflected at the ` ramp ' ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "thus , the structure changes from an unmagnetized shock to a magnetized one around that time .",
    "figure  [ fig : fields_t2000 ] shows the ion number density , the @xmath36-component of the current density @xmath191 , and the @xmath31-component of the magnetic field @xmath85 at @xmath212 .",
    "it is evident that many current filaments are generated in the interacting region and generate a strong magnetic field around themselves . a filamentary structure",
    "is also observed in the number density corresponding to the current filaments .",
    "these current filaments are generated by the ion beam - weibel instability between the counterstreaming ion populations .",
    "the generated magnetic field provides the dissipation mechanism for the ions to form the unmagnetized shock .",
    "figure  [ fig : ux_uy_t2000 ] shows @xmath202@xmath213 plots in the following three regions : @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and @xmath216 .",
    "the ions are almost completely isotropized and form a ring - like distribution in the @xmath202-@xmath213 plane far downstream ( @xmath216 ) . since the beam - weibel instability generates only the @xmath31-component of the magnetic field in this 2d configuration , the magnetic field deflects the ions only in the @xmath202-@xmath213 plane .",
    "however , in three dimensions , the generated magnetic field can have the @xmath39-component and the ions can be deflected in all directions , resulting in three - dimensional dissipation .",
    "the dissipated ions form the downstream region of the shock and the shock structure propagates upstream at an almost constant speed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ni_dev ] for @xmath217 . in the present simulation ,",
    "this weibel - mediated shock disappears when the effect of the background magnetic field becomes significant at later times .",
    "however , this shock can propagate steadily upstream when there is no background field @xcite .",
    "in the previous section it was found that the filamentary structures in our simulation are generated by the ion beam  weibel instability in the foot region .",
    "similar structures have been found in the foot or overshoot region in 2d pic or hybrid simulations with lower mach numbers .",
    "there are two different causes for these structures : the emission of whistler waves at the ramp @xcite and the emission of alfvn waves due to the alfvn ion cyclotron instability , resulting in a structure called rippling @xcite .",
    "since these are associated with waves generated at the ramp or the overshoot and which then propagate upstream , these processes could also be related to the filamentary structures in our simulation .",
    "the wavenumber range of the whistler wave is given by @xcite : @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the local electron number density at which the whistler wave exists and @xmath7 and @xmath220 are defined for the far upstream .",
    "the left - hand side is @xmath221 in our simulation and if we take @xmath222 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : v_prof](c ) ] and @xmath223 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : foot_filaments](d ) ] as typical values , the above condition is ( marginally ) satisfied .",
    "however , if the structure is related with ( standing ) whistler waves , its group velocity must be greater than the shock speed ( in the upstream frame ) : @xmath224 where @xmath5 and @xmath225 are defined for the far upstream , whereas @xmath226 is the local value .",
    "[ here , we neglect the dependence of the propagation angle and hence it is just a necessary condition ; c.f . , @xcite .",
    "] this condition can be rewritten as @xmath227 in our simulation , the right - hand side is @xmath228 , whereas the left - hand side is @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the filamentary structure observed in our simulation does not originate from whistler wave emission . on the other hand",
    ", the result of the simulation by @xcite with @xmath229 satisfies this condition if @xmath230 ; the right - hand side is @xmath231 , whereas the left - hand side is @xmath232 . assuming @xmath223 and @xmath233 , a rough condition for the alfvn mach number is given by @xmath234 this gives @xmath235 for the mass ratio in our simulation ( @xmath236 ) and @xmath237 for the real mass ratio of @xmath238 .",
    "the rippling @xcite can not be the cause of the filamentary structure in our simulation because ( 1 ) the rippling develops in the overshoot region , whereas the filamentary structure in our simulation develops in the foot region ; ( 2 ) the wavelength observed in our simulation ( @xmath239 ) is smaller than that of alfvn waves ( @xmath240 for @xmath236 ) ; and ( 3 ) the alfvn speed in the foot is smaller than the shock speed .",
    "nevertheless , comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : j_b ] with the figures in @xcite reveals that the structures of the magnetic field and the number density at and behind the overshoot are similar to each other .",
    "therefore , the rippling mechanism may also operate there in our simulation .",
    "@xcite showed that these structures can also be affected by the dimensionality of the simulations in 2d simulations ; the structures when the background magnetic field lies in the simulation plane may differ from those when it is perpendicular to the plane .",
    "electron acceleration was not observed in our simulation , whereas @xcite observed a kind of electron acceleration in a perpendicular shock in their 2d pic simulation , which used similar parameters to ours .",
    "the main reason for this is considered to be the different directions of the upstream background field : in our simulation it lay in the simulation plane , whereas in the simulation by @xcite it was out of the plane .",
    "this again demonstrates that dimensionality can affect the results , even for 2d simulations .    the ion",
    " ion streaming instability @xcite , which has a wavevector that is highly oblique to the streaming direction , can be driven by the interaction between the incoming ions and the reflected ions streaming upstream in the foot region and it can contribute to ion heating @xcite .",
    "[ this instability can also be driven in front of electrostatic shocks in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "] however , this instability was not observed in our simulation ( see the right panels in fig .",

    "ion streaming instability is efficient for wavenumbers @xmath242 , whereas it is damped for @xmath243 due to the thermal motion of the ions .",

    "the two ion populations have different temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t_prof ] ) and the debye wavenumber of the reflected ions , @xmath245 , should be used to evaluate the thermal damping effect .",
    "thus , the condition for effective growth of the ion  ion streaming instability is @xmath246 or @xmath247 the right - hand side of this equation is always smaller than unity , whereas the left - hand side is larger than unity in our simulation , as shown in fig .",

    "<S> a two - dimensional particle - in - cell simulation is performed to investigate weakly magnetized perpendicular shocks with a magnetization parameter of @xmath0 , which is equivalent to a high alfvn mach number @xmath1 of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that current filaments form in the foot region of the shock due to the ion - beam  weibel instability ( or the ion filamentation instability ) and that they generate a strong magnetic field there . in the downstream region </S>",
    "<S> , these current filaments also generate a tangled magnetic field that is typically 15 times stronger than the upstream magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal energies of electrons and ions in the downstream region are not in equipartition and their temperature ratio is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> efficient electron acceleration was not observed in our simulation , although a fraction of the ions are accelerated slightly on reflection at the shock . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation results agree very well with the rankine  hugoniot relations . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that electrons and ions are heated in the foot region by the buneman instability ( for electrons ) and the ion - acoustic instability ( for both electrons and ions ) . however , the growth rate of the buneman instability is significantly reduced due to the relatively high temperature of the reflected ions . for the same reason , </S>",
