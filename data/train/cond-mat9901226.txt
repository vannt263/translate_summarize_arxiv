    "shear flow induces phase transitions and dynamic instabilities in many complex fluids , including wormlike micelles @xcite , liquid crystals , @xcite ; and lamellar surfactant systems which can `` roll '' into multilamellar vesicles ( `` onions '' ) @xcite .",

    "[ fig : both ] shows that phase separation can occur at either common stress or common strain rate , depending on the geometry of the bands @xcite : bands stacked along the axis of a couette cell have the same strain rate and different shear stresses , while radial phase separation imposes a uniform shear stress and different strain rates .",

    "unfortunately , most systems are sufficiently complicated that none of the observed transitions can be completely described , even qualitatively , by a credible microscopic model .",
    "for example , in certain limits the class of shear - thinning wormlike micelle systems which shear band has a mature theory for the linear rheology , which may be extended using successful ideas from entangled polymer dynamics to predict an instability @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a complete description of phase coexistence also requires knowledge of the shear - induced state , as well as details of the concentration dependence and , as we shall see , the inhomogeneous contribution to the dynamical equations .",
    "we are , at present , far from having all of these ingredients , and in many cases we do not have a clear understanding of even the structure of the high shear rate state , much less its dynamics .",

    "although the shear rates necessary for inducing a transition are , in practice , typically quite high unless very long rods are used , and physical systems are often susceptible to various dynamical instabilities , this model system is quite helpful for building intuition about how to calculate non - equilibrium `` phase diagrams '' and how their resulting topologies resemble and differ from their equilibrium counterparts .",

    "[ fig : both ] , one needs to determine the selected stress for an imposed strain rate ( for phase separation at a common stress ) .",
    "it has emerged that an unambiguous resolution of this problem is to include explicit non - local terms in the dynamical equations and explicitly construct the coexisting state @xcite .",
    "this reduces to the equilibrium construction in the case of zero shear , and can be shown to yield a single ( barring accidental degeneracies ) stress ( given all other imposed conditions ) at which coexistence occurs @xcite .",
    "below we summarize some results of our calculations on the doi model for rigid rod suspensions in shear flow @xcite ; the details will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this system is surprisingly rich , given its apparent simplicity and fairly obvious coupling of internal order to flow .",

    "the phase diagram , and in fact the dynamics , can be more conveniently represented by the exclude volume parameter @xmath4 , defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the rod volume fraction , @xmath7 is the rod aspect ratio and @xmath8 is an @xmath9 prefactor @xcite .",
    "beginning from the smoluchowski equation for a solution of rigid rods , and including a maier - sauper  like orientational interaction parameter , doi was able to derive approximate coupled equations of motion for the dynamics of @xmath10 , and the fluid velocity @xmath11 , including the liquid crystalline contribution to the fluid stress tensor .",
    "the essential physics is that flow tends to align the rodlike molecules , typically roughly parallel to the flow direction , and hence stabilizes a nematic , or aligned , state . to study other complex fluids we would have a structural variable analogous to @xmath10 ; _",
    "e.g. _ in the wormlike micelle system we might need , in addition to the orientation tensor , the dynamics of the mean micellar size .",
    "we have augmented the doi model by allowing for concentration diffusion driven by chemical potential gradients , included the dynamical response to inhomogeneities in liquid crystalline order and concentration , and included the translational entropy of mixing which gives the system a biphasic coexistence regime in the absence of flow . for a given stress or strain rate",
