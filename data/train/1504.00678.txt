    "we therefore compared our results with those from fits in which these lines were masked out .",
    "we further tested out velocity dispersion results by carrying out the ppxf fits using a stellar library instead of ssps .",
    "we used a library with 193 stars from the indo - us library of coud feed stellar spectra @xcite .",
    "the selection of stars was performed to cover a wide range of effective temperatures , metallicities and surface gravities .",

    "the stellar library has the disadvantage of being less physical motivated , but , on the other hand , it provides wider spectral coverage by reaching down to 3460  , as compared to the pgase - hr ssp library , which cuts at 3900  .",
    "these fits were carried out masking and without masking h@xmath147 and h@xmath148 lines . in all these cases ,",
    "we obtain similar results : the mean of the differences is 0 and their standard deviation is 7 @xmath6 .",
    "the results from fitting stellar templates are very similar to those from ssps for four of the galaxies . for the other two ,",
    "the fits with stellar templates give lower , marginally inconsistent dispersions .",
    "specifically , for the galaxy i d 13018611 , we obtained @xmath149 using the stellar library and @xmath150 using ssps ( not masking the h@xmath147 and h@xmath148 lines in both cases ) .",
    "similarly , for the galaxy i d 12028173 , using the stellar library we obtained @xmath151 and @xmath152 using ssps ( bootstrap errors ) .",
    "as discussed in section  [ subsec : velocity - dispersions ] , we believe the fits to stellar templates are more uncertain given the intrinsic width of the caii h and k lines for some stellar temperatures , and hence we choose the solutions given by ssp fits .",

    "applying the masking they use to exclude regions affected by telluric absorption , and cutting the redder part of our spectrum to their red cut - off we could not reproduce their result : we obtained @xmath155 . in order to explore the origin of the difference , we repeated the measurement over the spectrum ( albeit without relative - flux calibration ) using ppxf and the above libraries ( pgase - hr and indo - us ) . using the pgase - hr library",
    ", we performed the fit for a wide range ( 113 ) of degrees of the legendre polynomial used to correct the continuum shape and found a strong dependence with this parameter obtaining values from 198 to 310 @xmath6 .",
    "doing the same exercise with the indo - us library , we did not find a clear dependence with the polynomial degree and the results cover a narrower range : 227259 @xmath6 .",
    "we also performed these tests in our spectrum for this galaxy ( using the same wavelength ranges and masking the same regions ) , and obtained the ranges 250264 and 239277 @xmath6  for pgase - hr and indo - us libraries , respectively .",
    "all these tests except one produce stable results similar to our measurement , while the unstable test corresponds to a similar situation to the published by : their spectrum and ssp templates .",
    "additional checks on our own spectra included a verification of the instrumental dispersion and its variation from night to night : measurement of the width of the telluric lines in the region of the kinematic signatures shows a very stable configuration ( @xmath156 fwhms ) .",
    "we conclude that the origin of the difference with is unclear , and might be related to the use of different velocity dispersion algorithms ; we have used our measurement in the paper .",

    "the first of these three ranges is the closest to the one used by us , and , for that fitting range , the two determinations agree within the errors . in any case , the differences found show that the true uncertainties in the velocity dispersion determinations can be underestimated using the standard techniques ( monte carlo simulations with white noise ) ; this fact has been already proven by @xcite . we have used our value in the paper for consistency , and emphasize that using their value would not modify the conclusions of this work .",
