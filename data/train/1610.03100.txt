    "our tree sizes are comparable to those of linear chains in similar studies  @xcite . however",
    ", for many purposes the average contour distance , @xmath238 , between monomers provides a more suitable comparison .",
    "the reader should thus bear in mind , that extracted exponents are either ( i ) effective ( crossover ) exponents valid for the particular systems and system sizes we have studied or ( ii ) _ estimates _ of true , asymptotic exponents , which suffer from uncertainties related to the extrapolation to the asymptotic limit .",
    "these effects are particularly pronounced for the high density @xmath21 melts we studied in ref .",
    "for example , we initially reported  @xcite the results of a simple power law fit including all data for tree sizes @xmath239 suggesting @xmath240 .",
    "in contrast , the present more refined analysis yields @xmath241 .",
    "if this result is acceptable as an effective exponent for tree sizes @xmath242 , it mostly illustrates that one can not extract the asymptotic behaviour assuming a _ single _ , small correction to scaling , if the available tree sizes barely reach the crossover ( sec .",
    "[ sec : blobsize2 ] ) .",
    "the discussion below focuses on results for lower density @xmath20 and @xmath21 melts , where the studied tree sizes are significantly larger than the estimated blob size .",
    "our results are summarised in table  [ tab : expsummary ] .",
    "most of them are in quantitative or at least good qualitative agreement with the predictions from flory theory  @xcite .",
    "first , this implies that the reported exponents @xmath100 for melts of trees fit to the predicted  @xcite value @xmath243 which , intriguingly , corresponds to the flory  @xcite exponent @xmath101 for self - avoiding _ linear _ chains in good solvent conditions .",
    "second , the results for the exponent @xmath101 are in agreement with the prediction @xmath244 and confirm that trees in melts behave as `` territorial '' polymers .",
    "this result is relatively simple to understand as @xmath244 represents the minimal amount of swelling compatible with steric packing requirements .",
    "thus not too much stock should be put in the fact that the flory value for @xmath101 turns out to be exact in the present case .",
    "more interestingly , the theory makes two testable , non - trivial predictions for the contributions of connectivity changes and path stretching to the overall swelling  @xcite ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rho_of_nu ] ) and ( [ eq : nupath_of_nu ] ) ) : firstly , both effects should only depend on the magnitude of the overall swelling , but not its physical origin and secondly path stretching is expected to be dominant as  @xcite @xmath245 for weakly swollen trees . the first prediction is well borne out by the comparison of @xmath21 self avoiding trees and @xmath20 melt trees . in both cases , the trees are expected to swell to @xmath17 .",
    "interestingly , the observed values for @xmath177 and @xmath100 turn out to be almost identical and close to the predicted values .",
    "the second prediction is confirmed by noticing that trees in @xmath20 and @xmath21 melts swell almost exclusively at the path level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r2maxlmax ] ) , while the observed modifications of the connectivities ( figs .",

    "motivated by the close analogy between non - concatenated ring polymers and annealed lattice trees  @xcite , we have studied the statistical properties of tree melts in @xmath1 and @xmath2 dimensions .",
