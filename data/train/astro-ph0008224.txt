    "astrophysics provides prime examples of random fields , such as the distribution of galaxies and the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "such random fields can be characterized statistically by a series of well chosen estimators .",
    "the most popular ones include counts - in - cells , @xmath0-point correlation functions , as well as statistics derived from them . indeed , there are mathematical theorems , which state that , under certain conditions , both series describe a random process fully .",
    "our goal in astrophysics is not simply estimating these statistics , but to constrain underlying theories .",
    "this aim necessitates a firm control over the expected statistical errors from a survey .",
    "the theory of errors for finite surveys , the `` cosmic statistics of statistics '' , is therefore of utmost importance for practical applications .",
    "such a theory was formulated in the past for counts in cells statistics .",
    "@xcite@xmath1@xcite@xmath1@xcite    for the @xmath0-point correlation functions , however , to date only partial results are published , such as calculation of the discreteness effects for the two - point correlation function@xcite , and for @xmath0-point correlation functions for poisson and multinomial point processes@xcite , full calculation for the two - point function under the hierarchical assumption with edge effects neglected@xcite , and some results in fourier space with various degree of approximations .",
    "the aim of this proceedings is to present the general variance calculation for @xmath0-point correlation functions with all major contributions included , such as discreteness effects , arising from sampling the underlying random field with a finite number of galaxies , edge effects , due to the geometry of the survey and the corresponding uneven weighting of @xmath0-tuples , and finite volume effects , caused by fluctuations at and above the scale of a survey . the underlying technique of calculation , as well as",
    "the fully general results are presented here ; specializations such as power spectrum and bispectrum , and approximations , such as weakly non - linear perturbation theory , hierarchical assumptions , will be presented elsewhere in collaboration with s. colombi , and a.s .",
    "szalay@xcite .",
    "the next section sets up the general mathematical framework for the calculation using computer algebra packages .",
    " 3 presents the results for @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the final discussion section outlines how the formulae can be used in practice , as well as describes developments in the immediate future .",
    "many interesting statistics , such as the @xmath0-point correlation functions and their fourier analogs , can be formulated as functions over @xmath0 points in a catalog .",
    "the covariance of a pair of such estimators will be calculated for a general point process under the assumption that the average density is _ a priori _ known .",
    "this is the obvious generalization of the poisson process when arbitrarily high order correlations are present .",
    "the number of objects is thus varied corresponding to a grand canonical ensemble in statistical physics .",
    "the following calculations lean heavily on the elegant formalism by ripley@xcite , which can be consulted for details , and are the direct generalization of the framework set up by szapudi & szalay.@xcite    let @xmath4 be a catalog of data points to be analyzed , and @xmath5 randomly generated over the same area , with averages @xmath6 , and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the role of @xmath5 is to perform a monte carlo integration compensating for edge effects , therefore eventually the limit @xmath8 will be taken .",
    "@xmath6 on the other hand is assumed to be externally estimated with arbitrary precision .",
    "no other assumption is taken about the point process . in practice , @xmath6 is usually estimated from the same survey , which gives rise to additional correlations , the `` integral constraint bias '' .",
    "this effect will be investigated in more detail elsewhere .",
    "following@xcite , let us define symbolically an estimator @xmath9 , with @xmath10 for a function @xmath11 symmetric in its arguments @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "as an example , the two point correlation function corresponds to @xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 is the distance between the two points , and @xmath16 $ ] equals @xmath17 when @xmath18 holds , @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "ensemble averages can be estimated via factorial moment measures , @xmath20.@xcite@xmath1@xcite in the poisson limit @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the @xmath23 dimensional lebesgue measure , and in the most general case @xmath24 .",
    "the function @xmath25 can be identified as the full , i.e. non - reduced , @xmath0-point correlation function .",
    "the connection between these and the reduced @xmath0-point correlation functions is well known@xcite , and can be obtained through either generating functions , or recursions .",
    "the general covariance of a pair of estimators is @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 will be specified later , @xmath29 denotes normalization with @xmath30 respectively , i.e. @xmath31 .",
    "the expression simply describes the fact that out of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 different data points in @xmath4 we have an @xmath34-fold degeneracy , as well as a @xmath35-fold degeneracy in the random points drawn from @xmath5 . to simplify the exposition of the calculation",
    ", it is convenient to assume from the very beginning the @xmath36 , i.e. the random process employed for the monte carlo integration of the shape of the survey is arbitrarily dense .",
    "this is usually achievable in practice , thus it will not be considered further .",
    "the above equation describes the cross - correlation of two estimators even for two different objects as well : e.g. , two particular bins of the two- and three - point correlation functions .",
    "an interesting special case , @xmath37 ( the average density in the survey ) and @xmath38 , is needed for calculating the `` integral constraint '' correction .",
    "when the random process is arbitrarily dense only @xmath39 survives , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is now an operator acting on @xmath42 , @xmath43 the operator @xmath44 is analogous to the phase space integral @xmath45@xcite .",
    "the dot emphasizes that the integral can be performed only after @xmath44 is acted on @xmath42 which is part of the measure .",
    "the phase space has to be calculated in the general case via the full factorial moment measure of which @xmath42 is an integral part . throughout the paper we use the convention that @xmath46 is nonzero only for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , and the variables",
    "@xmath49 are denoted with @xmath34 for simplicity . here",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 denote two different functions , for instance corresponding to two radial bins of two estimators of the same or different orders . in the above formula the symmetry of @xmath11 in its arguments",
    "was heavily relied on to achieve the above `` standard '' representation of the operator .",
    "the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath52 , and @xmath0 is not noted for convenience@xcite , but they will be assumed throughout the paper .",
    "the estimator@xcite for the generalized @xmath0-point correlation function is @xmath53 , or more precisely , @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( without subscript ) . in this case",
    "@xmath28 is a number since it corresponds to the poisson catalog with its simple factorial moment measure .",
    "the average of the estimator yields @xmath56 since the role of @xmath11 is effectively a window , with a window operator @xmath57 this can be written symbolically as @xmath58 . the asymptotic centered covariance between two estimators of the above for a general point process in the limit of @xmath36 can be written according to the previous considerations as @xmath59 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above the operator @xmath60 acts on the multiple of the two @xmath42 s on the right .",
    "the above equation is the main result of this paper .",
    "while it is quite cumbersome , it is easily expandable with the help of computer algebra , as demonstrated by the examples of the next section .",
    "the special cases rendered will also illustrate how the simplicity of the proposed class of estimators exactly manifests itself by a mass cancellation of terms .",
    "any other estimator would have extra terms in the variance.@xcite",
    "the above equation was entered into a computer algebra package .",
    "the symmetries and simplicity of the estimator give rise to cancellations and possibilities for collecting similar terms .",
    "this is the reason why the final result for the two - point correlation function has only three to six terms , while formally it could have up to about a hundred .",
    "alternative estimators , such as @xmath61 , etc . would not yield significantly less cancellations , therefore error - calculation for them was not attempted ; although the same formalism applies .",
    "the covariance for the two - point function ( or any quantity estimated from doublets of points , such as the power spectrum ) can be expressed after the cancellations and the possible simplifications as @xmath62 + \\\\    & & \\frac{4}{\\lambda}\\int\\phi_a(1,2)\\phi_b(1,3 )     \\left [ \\xi(2,3)+\\xi_3(1,2,3)\\right ] + \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\frac{2}{\\lambda^2}\\int\\phi_a(1,2)\\phi_b(1,2 )     \\left [ 1+\\xi(1,2)\\right ] \\bigl.\\bigr\\rbrace \\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equation is essentially identical to the result of hamilton@xcite where he calculates the variance of @xmath63 , the fluctuation field itself .",
    "this is not at all surprising.@xcite the estimator contains exactly the same terms and coefficients ( regardless of the choice of @xmath11 ) as @xmath63 itself , which strongly suggests that it is ( nearly ) optimal .",
    "the above formula contains the different contributions to the error@xcite entirely mixed .",
    "approximate separation of the different terms appears to be fruitless .",
    "the only general point to be made is that discreteness effects are absent in the first term , while they are present ( mixed with the other two effects ) in the @xmath64 terms , with @xmath65 .",
    "this is naturally true for the higher order calculations as well .",
    "it is worth to emphasize again , that this formula applies for the generalized @xmath66-point function , including the `` traditional '' @xmath66-point function , and any of its incarnations , such as the the power spectrum . in the latter case ,",
    "esthetic or practical reasons might dictate that the errors on the power spectrum are expressed in terms of the power - spectrum , bi- , and tri - spectrum , instead of the two- , three- , and four - point correlation functions .",
    "since the connection is a simple fourier transform , this trivial exercise is left for the reader .",
    "explicit formulae , aimed at practical applications for power - spectrum will be presented elsewhere.@xcite      the same method yields ( co)variance for higher order estimators as well .",
    "we present another example , the generalized three - point correlation function .",
    "its variance , using again the main result of the proceeding , translates into : @xmath67     \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\frac{9}{\\lambda}\\int\\phi_a(1,2,3)\\phi_b(1,4,5 )       \\bigl[\\bigr .",

    "the above equation is is less obviously useful then that of the two - point correlation function .",
    "nevertheless , given a model for the higher order correlation functions , such as weakly non - linear perturbation theory , or any well specified version of the hierarchical assumption , the equation can easily be turned into a practical computer program.@xcite    the variance of the four - point and higher order correlation functions can be calculated analogously , but it would make no sense to print the results . when needed , the formulae generated by computer algebra can be transformed into fortran or c - code directly .",
    "the above method , and the explicit formulae given , can be used to evaluate the cosmic error on any statistical measure based on @xmath0-tuples of a distribution .",
    "this includes , but is not limited to , @xmath0-point correlation functions , @xmath0-th order cumulants , cumulant correlators , multi - spectra , etc .",
    "the above calculation was performed only for the best @xmath0-point estimator.@xcite any other estimator can be calculated analogously , but be warned that the resulting number of terms can be overwhelming due to the insufficient cancellation arising from suboptimal edge correction .    the fact that the average density is assumed to be given as an outside parameter appears to be fairly restrictive . however ,",
    "maximum likelihood context , which is the most important potential practical application of the results , it is easy to remedy the situation .",
    "the proposed estimator@xcite can be trivially changed by _ not _ normalizing with the average density @xmath6 .",
    "this introduces only a small modification to the final formulae , and a set of estimators , including that of the the average count , contains all information need for constructing likelihood function .",
    "such a procedure yields full statistical description , takes into account fluctuations in the mean , and the fact the average is estimated from the same surveys ( `` integral constraint '' ) .",
    "practical demonstration of this procedure will be presented elsewhere.@xcite    the proposed estimator used here is not connected for @xmath70.@xcite therefore the calculations for the higher order connected estimator should be modified for accurate results for the connected moments .",
    "this trivial but tedious generalization is left for future research .",
    "the explicit formulae can be specialized for several cases , which will be presented elsewhere.@xcite the interesting limits include poisson , gaussian , weakly - nonlinear , strong correlations , hierarchy , shot noise limited , continuous limit etc .",
    "the detailed discussion of these limits , and specializations to particular statistics , such as @xmath71-point correlation functions , multi - spectra , would go beyond the scope of the present exposition .",
    "similarly , the main equation yields cross correlations between different statistics as well , a must for any investigation in the maximum likelihood framework .",
    "finally , it is worth to note here , that recent advances in algorithms for calculating @xmath0-point correlation functions render these objects more interesting then ever .",
    "fast algorithms@xcite will make it possible to calculate @xmath0-point functions from very large catalogs , be it artificial or real data , which undoubtedly will culminate in new insights into the subject .",
