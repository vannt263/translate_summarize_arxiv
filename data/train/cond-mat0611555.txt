    "a series of experiments devoted to intrinsic josephson junctions@xcite ( ijj ) shows the growing interest in the current - voltage characteristics ( ivc ) of the finite stack.@xcite different kinds of couplings between intrinsic josephson junctions determine a variety of the ivc observed in htsc and different models are exploited for their descriptions . among them",
    "are the inductive @xcite and capacitive coupling @xcite models , which usually give approximately similar results .",
    "a unified theory for magnetic and electric coupling in multistacked josephson junctions was developed.@xcite the capacitively coupled josephson junction model ( ccjj ) seizes the main dynamical properties of the ijj system , describes the multibranch structure in the ivc of the stack of ijj@xcite and explains the microwave resonant absorption.@xcite on the other side a diffusion current plays an important role in the stack of ijj @xcite . the ccjj model with diffusion current ( ccjj+dc model ) was derived in ref .",
    "on the microscopic level .",
    "it gives an equidistant branch structure.@xcite close to the hysteresis jump the system of ijj is unstable towards a switching .",
    "a resonance between the josephson and plasma oscillations causes the system to switch to another branch .",
    "this mechanism in case of one josephson junction has been considered long time ago.@xcite",
    "the `` breakpoint region '' ( bpr ) on the ivc of the stack of ijj was demonstrated in ref . and it is explained as a result of resonance between josephson and plasma oscillations .",
    "we consider , that simulation of the ivc of ijj by different groups using different models shows the bpr on the outermost branch as well , but the authors did not mention it ( see particularly , fig.3a in ref . in ccjj model ; fig.1 in ref . in charge imbalance ( cib ) model ; fig.2(left ) in ref . in cib model ) .",
    "to our knowledge , no precise experiment to observe the bpr has been carried out yet .    in this paper",
    "we show that a detailed investigation of the breakpoint current @xmath0 and bpr width @xmath1 gives us new important information concerning the creation of longitudinal plasma waves ( lpw ) in stacks of ijj and the peculiarities of the stacks with a finite number of ijj .",
    "we study the ivc of ijj in the framework of the ccjj+dc model and investigate the dependence of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 on the number of junctions n in the stack .",
    "we demonstrate the existence of the bpr on the branches corresponding to the stack with one oscillating junction ( o - junction ) and show that such information may allow to develop a new method for the diagnostics of the ijj .",
    "in the ccjj model@xcite a relation between the charge @xmath2 and the generalized scalar potential @xmath3 of the @xmath4-th layer is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is debye screening length and @xmath3 is expressed through a scalar potential @xmath7 and derivative of phase @xmath8 of superconducting condensate by @xmath9.@xcite the last relation reflects a nonequilibrium nature of the ac josephson effect in layered superconductors@xcite .",
    "the superconducting layers are in nonequilibrium state due to the injection of quasiparticles and cooper pairs . in the equilibrium state @xmath10 . in the ccjj+dc model@xcite with diffusion current @xmath11 between layers @xmath4 and @xmath12 the total external current through the stack",

    "this total external current is different from the current in the ccjj model by third term in the right hand side of the equation  ( [ current ] ) . in the ccjj model",
    "it is equal to @xmath19 . as a result ,",

    "we calculate the dc voltages on each junction as    @xmath45    where @xmath14 is normalized to the @xmath46 . the average of voltage @xmath47 is given by @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 determine the interval for the averaging . after completing the voltage averaging for current @xmath31 ,",
    "the current @xmath31 is increased or decreased by a small amount @xmath51 to calculate the voltages in the next point of the ivc .",
    "we use a distribution of phases and their derivatives achieved in the previous point of the ivc as an initial distribution for the current point .",
    "numerical stability was checked by doubling and dividing in half the temporal discretization steps dt and checking the influence on the ivc .",
    "finally we can obtain the total dc voltage @xmath52 of the stack by    @xmath53    at some current @xmath31 some junction ( or junctions ) switches to the nonzero voltage state and gives some branch of the ivc .",
    "we plot the total ivc at different parameters of the problem .",
    "the details concerning the numerical procedure are given in refs ..    to investigate the bpr in detail , we have calculated the ivc for different boundary conditions for the stacks with different number n of ijj from @xmath54 to @xmath55 . for clarity",

    "we have found that the breakpoint current @xmath0 and bpr width @xmath1 depend on the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , boundary conditions and number of junctions in the stack .",
    "let us first describe the main features of the bpr which follow from the results of the simulation . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ 1]a , at @xmath58 both @xmath0 and @xmath57 are increased with n , but the increase of the @xmath0 is monotonic .",
    "the ivc of the stacks with even n have larger @xmath1 at small @xmath24 .",
    "the ivc in the bpr shows a chaotic behavior and its width is decreased with @xmath24 .",
    "there is a saturation of n - dependence of the @xmath0 at large n.    at @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "[ 1]b ) these features remain unchanged but the value of the @xmath1 is decreased for all stacks , especially for @xmath59 and it is equal to zero for @xmath54 .",
    "this change in the boundary conditions leads to the relative changing of the bpr width in different stacks as well .",
    "the ivc at periodic boundary condition ( fig .",
    "[ 2 ] ) show the same behavior for the @xmath0 and bpr width @xmath1 for the stacks with odd n as in the nonperiodic case , but for the stacks with even n the value of the @xmath0 does not depend on the n and the bpr for these stacks is absent .    in fig .",
    "[ 3]a the @xmath0 as a function of @xmath24 for @xmath58 ( squares , curve 1 ) and periodic ( circles , curve 2 ) boundary conditions at different value of the coupling parameter @xmath25 is presented .",
    "we stress the coincidence of the n - dependencies of the @xmath0 for stacks with odd numbers of ijj for periodic and @xmath60 cases .",
    "the increase in @xmath25 leads to the saturation of the n - dependence at larger n. the value of saturated @xmath0 is decreased with coupling and consists of 0.576 at @xmath61 , 0.454 at @xmath62 and 0.304 at @xmath63 . at @xmath64",
    "the breakpoint coincides with the return current , so the @xmath0 has the same value for the stacks with different number of junctions .",
    "the n - dependence of the bpr width @xmath1 for stacks with even and odd number of junctions at @xmath58 ( curves @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) and periodic ( curve @xmath67 ) boundary conditions is shown in fig .",
    "the main feature here is a decrease of the bpr width @xmath1 with n at large n. at small n in the interval ( 3,6 ) we observe the increase of the @xmath1 with n.     for @xmath58 ( curve 1 ) and periodic ( curve 2 ) boundary conditions at different @xmath25 ; ( b ) - the n - dependence of the bpr width @xmath1 for stacks with even and odd number of junctions at @xmath58 ( 1 ) and periodic ( 2 ) boundary conditions.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]   for @xmath58 ( curve 1 ) and periodic ( curve 2 ) boundary conditions at different @xmath25 ; ( b ) - the n - dependence of the bpr width @xmath1 for stacks with even and odd number of junctions at @xmath58 ( 1 ) and periodic ( 2 ) boundary conditions.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]",
    "to explain the observed features of the finite stacks ivc let us discuss the origin of the breakpoint on the outermost branch .",
    "the hysteresis jump in the ivc is associated with the change of the distribution pattern of rotating phase motions.@xcite but the question `` why does a change in the current leads to the change in a distribution pattern of the rotating phase motions '' is still open .",
    "we consider a case that all junctions are in the rotating state , i.e. the time average of @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is constant and that of @xmath70 is zero for these junctions . for the oscillating junctions",
    "the situation is opposite : the time average of @xmath68 is zero and that of @xmath71 is constant .",
    "as we mentioned above , the outermost branch in the ivc corresponds to the state of the stack with all junctions in the rotating state .",
    "let us write an equation for the difference of phase differences @xmath72 for the outermost branch .    by subtracting equation  ( [ phase ] ) for @xmath73 and @xmath74 junctions",
    "we get @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the discrete laplacian . consider a linear approximation @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , @xmath79 is josephson frequency , @xmath52 is total voltage of the stack , we obtain @xmath80     diagram .",

    "the important fact for us is that this linearized equation manifests a parametric resonance in the system of ijj . in fig .",
    "[ 4]a we plot the resonance region for this equation on the diagram @xmath91 . the dark stripe on this figure is actually the distribution of the dots , corresponding to the positions of the breakpoints of the outermost branch . using the breakpoint values of the voltage in the equation @xmath92",
    "we obtain this distribution of the breakpoints by the variation of the coupling parameter @xmath25 in the interval ( 1,2 ) with a step 0.1 and the dissipation parameter @xmath26 in the interval ( 0.01,0.34 ) with the step 0.01 at each value of @xmath25 .",
    "in contrast to the results presented in ref . where the positions of the dots on the diagram @xmath91 were obtained by crude estimation , here",
    "we have done the precise numerical calculations .",
    "this calculations show more close positions of the breakpoints to the boundary of the resonance region in the chosen intervals of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the reason , that the position of the breakpoints are shifted from the boundary of the resonance region in fig .",
    "[ 4]a , is the linear approximation used to obtain the equation  ( [ d - e - dp - l ] ) .",
    "the breakpoints are inside of the resonance region , i.e. the resonance between the josephson and plasma oscillations is approached at the breakpoint @xmath0 . as a result",
    "the plasma mode is excited by the josephson oscillations .",
    "we can prove this statement directly .",
    "by maxwell equation , @xmath93 , we express the charge @xmath2 on the s - layer @xmath4 by the voltages @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the neighbor insulating layers @xmath96 .",
    "the time dependence of the @xmath2 , presented in fig .",
    "[ 4]b1 , demonstrates that at periodic bc in the stacks with 10 ijj the lpw with @xmath97 is realized .",
    "really , the charge on the nearest neighbor layers has the same value and an opposite sign .",
    "[ 4]b2 shows the distribution of the charge on the s - layers in the stacks with 11 ijj at periodic bc . in this case",
    "we observe the creation of the lpw with @xmath98 . to determine the mode of the lpw at nonperiodic bc need more detail investigation .",
    "[ 4]b3 demonstrates the charge distribution in the stack with 10 ijj at @xmath99 near the breakpoint .",
    "the wavelengths of the standing lpw which can be realized in the stack with @xmath24 junctions are @xmath100 units of lattice in z - direction , where @xmath101 changes from 1 to @xmath102 for stacks with even number of junctions and from 1 to @xmath103 for odd @xmath24 .",
    "the voltage of the stack at the breakpoint is related to the wave number @xmath104 of the lpw by formulae @xmath105 , so the largest breakpoint voltage @xmath52 in the current decreasing process corresponds to the creation of the lpw with @xmath104 equal to @xmath106 ( @xmath106-mode ) for stacks with even number of ijj and modes with @xmath107 for stacks with odd n.",
    "let us now return to the results presented in fig .",
    "[ 1]-fig .",
    "[ 3 ] and demonstrate that they are in agreement with the ideas stated in the previous section .",
    "according to these ideas , in the stack with 10 ijj the lpw with @xmath107 is created and it leads to the increase of the @xmath0 with @xmath24 and its saturation to the value , corresponding to the @xmath106-mode .",
    "the same modes are created in the stacks with @xmath108 which outermost branches of the ivc are presented in fig .",
    "they demonstrate the saturation of the @xmath0 to the same value .    as fig .",
    "[ 2 ] shows , at periodic bc we observe the same value of @xmath0 in the all stacks with even n. it is in agreement with our suggestion that in this case the lpw with @xmath109 is created .",
    "we check it directly as well , by the time dependence of the @xmath2 .",
    "we find that at periodic bc in the stacks with even n the charge on the nearest neighbor layers has the same value and an opposite sign which means that the lpw with @xmath110 is realized .    in the stacks with odd",
    "n the @xmath106-mode can not exist , so as we mentioned in the previous section , the lpw with the largest @xmath104 equal to @xmath107 is created .",
    "the creation of different modes of the lpw leads to the different @xmath0 and this fact explains the difference in the ivc at periodic bc of the stacks with even and odd numbers of ijj . with increase in n the wave number @xmath104 limits to @xmath106 and it leads to the increase in @xmath0 which we observe in fig .",
    "it explains as well the saturation of the @xmath0 to the value corresponding to the @xmath0 for stacks with even n which is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ 3]a .    the difference between the charge distribution on the s - layers at the breakpoint current at fixed time for stacks with even and odd numbers of ijj ( 10 and 11 ) at periodic bc is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ 4]b . in the stack with odd n",
    "the charge on the first and last layers oscillates in - phase and the oscillations on the neighbor s - layers are different from the oscillations in @xmath106-mode .",
    "because at @xmath58 the charge on the first and last layers is screened due to the proximity effect , the lpw with the @xmath107 as at periodic bc for stacks with odd n is also created both for stacks with odd and even n. this is a reason the values of @xmath0 for stacks with odd n coincide for both these bc as shown in fig .",
    "[ 3]a .    at @xmath111 the same modes are created , but the character of the charge distribution among the s - layers is different ( as we can see in fig .",
    "[ 4]b3 ) . as a result in this case",
    "the n - dependence of the @xmath0 is stronger than at @xmath58 , but at @xmath112 it is saturated as well and the saturation value is the @xmath0 for even junctions at periodic bc .",
    "the influence of the coupling parameter on the value of the breakpoint current @xmath0 and its n - dependence which is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ 3]a has a clear explanation .",
    "it consists in the mentioned in the previous section the @xmath25-dependence of the voltage , and correspondingly , the breakpoint current @xmath0 .",
    "they are proportional to the term @xmath113 .",
    "an increase in @xmath104 leads to the term proportional to the @xmath114 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath25 makes this influence weaker .",
    "we may explain an increase in @xmath1 at small @xmath24 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ 3]b by a commensurability effect on the width of the bpr . at periodic bc @xmath115 ,",
    "if the wavelength @xmath116 of the lpw is @xmath117 , where @xmath118 lattice units in z - direction . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ 2 ] , at @xmath119 ( for stacks with @xmath54 ) and @xmath120 ( @xmath106-mode ) , the ivc do not show the bpr .",
    "the creation of the lpw with wavelength in the middle of the interval ( 2,3 ) should correspond to some maximum of the bpr width @xmath1 . in the stack with 5 ijj",
    "the lpw with @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) is created .",
    "it does not coincide exactly with the result obtained by the simulation , because we use for the explanation the linearized equation for difference of phase differences and fourier expansion in the finite stacks .",
    "the wave number @xmath104 is not well defined in this case . with increase in n",
    "the wave number @xmath104 of lpw limits to @xmath106 and it explains the increase in @xmath0 and the decrease in @xmath1 at large @xmath24 which demonstrated by fig .  [ 3]b .",
    "the change in the boundary conditions changes the character of the charge oscillations on the s - layers .",
    "particularly , at @xmath99 we observe a decrease in the @xmath1 for all stacks .",
    "our analysis shows that in stacks with even n at nonperiodic bc the charge on the second and @xmath123 layers oscillate in - phase , but anti - phase in the stacks with odd n. we consider that the value of the bpr width @xmath1 depends on the character of the charge oscillations on the s - layers .    finally , we note that in the case of coupling between junctions the parameter @xmath26 can not be determined in a usual way by the return current , because it depends now on two parameters , @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0 and bpr width @xmath1 on the dissipation and coupling parameters opens an opportunity to develop the new method for determination of these parameters for the stacks of ijj .",
    "this question will be discussed in detail somewhere else .",
    "let us now discuss briefly the breakpoints on the other branches of the ivc .    [ !",
    "ht ] , @xmath124 and @xmath60 .",
    "the upper curve corresponds to the real scale of voltage , but the other ones are shifted for clarity by two units down.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]    as we mentioned above a resistive state in the system of ijj is realized as a state with different number of r- and o - junctions.@xcite the different positions of r- and o - junctions in the stack ( different configurations ) correspond to the different states of ijj system .",
    "the equidistant positions of the o - junction from the ends of the stack ( for example , the stacks with 1st or 10th o - junction ) lead to the same state .",
    "so , there are five different states in the stack with one o - junction corresponding to the different position of this junction .",
    "[ 5 ] shows the bpr on the branches of the ivc of the stacks with one o - junction in the case of 10 ijj at @xmath61 , @xmath124 and @xmath60 .",
    "the equidistant positions of the o - junction from the ends of the stack lead to the same value of @xmath0 and the same width of bpr .",
    "the shift of the o - junction from the end of the stack to its center decreases the @xmath0 of the corresponding state .",
    "so , we may establish a delay of the lpw creation in the current decreasing process when the position of the o - junction is shifted to the center of the stack .",
    "we consider that the origin of such behaviour is the next .",
    "this one oscillating junction separates the stack in two parts with different number of r - junctions which are weakly coupled through it . with a decrease in current the first lpw",
    "is created in the part with the largest @xmath0 ( with the largest number of junctions ) .",
    "the shift of the @xmath125-junction and the decrease in the number of r - junctions in this part lead to the decrease of the @xmath0 as fig .",
    "[ 1 ] demonstrates .",
    "the increase of the number of junctions in the second part might manifest the second breakpoint which is related to the creation of lpw in this second part of the stack .",
    "such situation is observed for @xmath126 when o - junction occupies the 5th or 6th site in the stack .",
    "the width of the bpr in the other branches of ivc depends essentially on the state of the stack .    for the other branches the increase in the number of the o - junctions in the stack decreases the number of effective junctions for creation of the lpw and it leads to the decrease of the return current .",
    "this fact explains why we can obtain a total branch structure in the hysteresis region , because in the other case we would not be able to observe it in the simulation .",
    "the correspondence between the position of the o - junction in the stack and the value of the @xmath0 opens the possibility for junction diagnostics , i.e. by measuring the value of the @xmath0 we can answer the question which junction in the stack goes into r- or o - state . from the other side ,",
    "the monitoring of the transitions between branches is useful for understanding the phase dynamics in the system of ijj .",
    "in conclusion , we stress that the bpr in the ivc `` naturally '' follows from the solution of the system of the dynamical equations for the phase difference for the stack of ijj . in breakpoint region",
    "the plasma mode is a stationary solution of the system and this fact might be used in some applications , particularly , in high frequency devices such as thz oscillators and mixers .",
    "the detailed study of the breakpoint current and breakpoint region width gives a new opportunity for the investigation of the properties of ijj and and develop new methods for the determination of the parameters of ijj and diagnostic of ijj in the stacks .",

    "<S> we study the breakpoint region on the outermost branch of current - voltage characteristics of the stacks with different number of intrinsic josephson junctions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at periodic boundary conditions the breakpoint region is absent for stacks with even number of junctions . for stacks with odd number of junctions and for stacks with nonperiodic boundary conditions the breakpoint current is increased with number of junctions and saturated at the value corresponding to the periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the region of saturation and the saturated value depend on the coupling between junctions . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the results by the parametric resonance at the breakpoint and excitation of the longitudinal plasma wave by josephson oscillations . a way for the diagnostics of the junctions in the stack is proposed . </S>"
