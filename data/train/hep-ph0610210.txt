    "within the ( not quite ) decoupling low energy effective theory ( leet ) scenario discussed by jan stern  @xcite , the only two operators appearing at nlo modify the charged current ( cc ) interaction",
    ". we will discuss whether it is possible to experimentally constrain the corresponding couplings .",
    "we will focus on the light quark sector where we will have to cope with the problem that it is not easy to disentangle the effects of non - standard electroweak couplings from ( non - perturbative ) qcd effects .",
    "we will see that in this respect @xmath2 decays present a stringent test of the sm and possible extensions giving rise to right - handed charged quark currents ( rhcs ) .    in this talk we will consider a universal modification of the quark cc interaction leading to the following effective couplings at nlo for the vector and axial quark current , respectively : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two a priori independent quark mixing matrices and the two parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 measure the departure from the sm .",
    "the leptonic cc will not be modified  @xcite . within the leet scenario ,",
    "the two parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be related to the two nlo operators , but the same structure is shared by many models , as for example left - right symmetric extensions of the sm .    in tree level processes , we will encounter in the light quark sector , apart from @xmath6 , the following two combinations : @xmath8 measuring the amount of @xmath9 and @xmath10 rhcs , respectively .",
    "we will in turn discuss the information we obtain on these parameters from @xmath2 and hadronic tau decays .",
    "the hadronic matrix element describing the @xmath11 decay can be written in terms of two form factors : @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "we will concentrate on the normalized scalar form factor @xmath14 the callan - treiman low - energy theorem ( ct )  @xcite fixes the value of @xmath15 at the point @xmath16 in the @xmath17 chiral limit .",
    "we can write @xmath18 where the ct discrepancy @xmath19 defined by eq .",
    "( @xmath20 ) is expected to be small and eventually calculable in @xmath21 .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath22 and/or @xmath23 . in the limit @xmath24 at the nlo in @xmath21 one",
    "has for the ct discrepancy @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "we will focus the discussion on the neutral kaon mode since the analysis of the charged mode is subject to larger uncertainties related , in particular , to @xmath26 mixing  @xcite .    at low energies",
    "the form factor can be parameterized accurately in terms of only one parameter , @xmath27 , in a model independent way . to that end",
    "we employ a twice subtracted dispersion relation .",
    "one usually assumes that @xmath15 has no zeros . in that case",
    "we can write  @xcite : @xmath28}~ , \\label{dispf}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 @xmath30 is the threshold of @xmath31 scattering and @xmath32 is the phase of @xmath15 . at sufficiently low energies",
    "this phase should agree , due to watson s theorem , with the @xmath33-wave , @xmath34 scattering phase , @xmath35 .",
    "we take @xmath36 up to an energy of @xmath37 . in this domain ,",
    "as observed experimentally  @xcite , the scattering amplitude is to a very good approximation elastic , and @xmath38 is known precisely from a roy - steiner analysis  @xcite . following brodsky - lepage  @xcite , asymptotically",
    "the phase should reach @xmath39 . in between the elastic and the asymptotic region",
    "we will assume @xmath40 . in principle",
    "it is possible to infer the phase of the form factor above the elastic region using a somewhat model dependent omnes - mushkelishvili construction as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in any case , due to the two subtractions",
    "the dispersive integral converges rapidly , keeping the error arising from the uncertainties in the high - energy behavior of the phase small .",
    "we nevertheless checked that in the low - energy region the phase of ref .",
    "@xcite reproduces our function @xmath41 within errors .",
    "it can be observed that within the whole physical region the value of @xmath41 stays at least a factor of five smaller than the expected value of @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "we include uncertainties on the extraction of @xmath43 and the high - energy behavior into the error on @xmath41 .",
    "our dispersive representation allows to obtain the slope , @xmath44 , and the curvature , @xmath45 , of the form factor at @xmath46 in terms of only one parameter , @xmath27 : @xmath47 where the taylor expansion of the form factor has been written as follows : @xmath48 what is the value of @xmath27 ?",
    "we can express @xmath49 in terms of the measured branching ratio br  @xmath50  @xcite , the inclusive decay rate @xmath51  @xcite , and the value of @xmath52 known from superallowed @xmath53 nuclear @xmath54-decays  @xcite as @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 this gives to first order in @xmath7 @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 have been defined in eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) .",
    "assuming sm weak interactions , i.e. , @xmath62 , we obtain the following very precise prediction for @xmath44 ( cf . eqs .",
    "( [ slope]),([lncexp ] ) ) : @xmath63 this value can be compared with the slope parameter @xmath64 measured in @xmath2 decay experiments .",
    "it has to be stressed that the measured slope parameter can not be directly interpreted as the slope of the form factor at @xmath46 since it is determined from a global fit to the measured decay distributions employing a linear parametrization , @xmath65 , for the form factor . to better illustrate the problem ,",
    "let us define an effective slope by @xmath66 since the curvature of the form factor is positive , @xmath67 is a monotonically rising function of @xmath68 .",
    "this means that @xmath69 , i.e. , the measured slope parameter represents an upper bound for the value of @xmath44 .    comparing the published value of the ktev collaboration , @xmath70  @xcite , and the preliminary value of na48 , @xmath71  @xcite , with the sm prediction in eq .",
    "( [ lambda0 ] ) , this indicates that we need a correction on the percent level , whereas estimates of the callan - treiman correction within @xmath21 give @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "thus , the callan - treiman low - energy theorem , in combination with measurements of the scalar @xmath1 form factor offers a very interesting test of the sm and possible new physics .",
    "if we admit that the charged current interaction gets modified and that we have rhcs , we get an additional correction sensitive to @xmath73 , cf .",
    "( [ lncexp ] ) . @xmath60 and @xmath61 represent the strengths of @xmath74 and @xmath75 rhcs , respectively .",
    "it should be mentioned on the one hand that rhcs can escape detection in @xmath2 decays , if the right - handed mixing matrix is aligned with the left - handed ckm matrix , i.e. , @xmath76 . on the other hand , it is possible that @xmath60 gets enhanced by an inverse hierarchy of mixing matrix elements in the right - handed sector compared with the left - handed mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "if we take the specific framework of the leet  @xcite , we expect from power counting arguments @xmath7 to be of the order of percent",
    ". therefore @xmath61 can not be much larger than 0.01 , whereas @xmath60 could be larger .",
    "let us now infer the value of @xmath77 from the data on @xmath64 .",
    "unfortunately the determination of @xmath27 from @xmath64 is subject to large parametrization uncertainties .",
    "as explained above , the interpretation of @xmath64 in terms of the slope of the form factor is not clear and the measured slope parameter represents only an upper bound for @xmath44 .",
    "we therefore only get an upper bound for @xmath77 : @xmath78~,\\\\ \\delta\\epsilon_{\\mathit{max } } & = & -0.0379 \\pm 0.0201\\pm 0.0040~ [ \\mathrm{na48}]~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first error corresponds to the experimental error on @xmath64 and the branching ratios .",
    "the second one indicates the error on @xmath41 inherent to our dispersive representation .",
    "the situation is illustrated for the ktev data in fig .",
    "[ figlambda ] where we display the value of @xmath77 in terms of @xmath64 .",
    "the upper hatched curve indicates the result choosing @xmath79 , the lower hatched curve @xmath80 .",
    "errors on the branching ratios and on @xmath41 have been added in quadrature .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the ktev measurement , whereas the horizontal line corresponds to the sm case with @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "including the parametrization uncertainty as an error , we obtain @xmath82 ( ktev data ) as indicated by the gray shaded area .",
    "the same procedure leads to @xmath83 using the preliminary na48 data .",
    "these values are perfectly consistent with the expectation from the leet , but pointing to an enhancement of @xmath60 .    , vertical lines : ktev measurements of @xmath44 .",
    "top hatched curve : @xmath84 and bottom hatched curve : @xmath85 with uncertainties from branching ratios and from g(t ) added in quadrature . _ _ ]    from the above discussion it is clear that the uncertainty due to the difficulties in interpreting the measured slope parameter dominates .",
    "the dispersive representation we proposed for the form factor  @xcite , allows for an accurate description within the whole physical region in terms of only one parameter , @xmath42 . as explained above",
    ", a direct measurement of @xmath27 can prove very important in testing the sm and possible physics beyond the sm .",
    "we discussed in which way a possible discrepancy between the sm , as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ lambda0 ] ) , and the measured slope parameter , could be explained as an effect of rhcs .",
    "the hadronic tau decays are semileptonic decays involving the charged current .",
    "even though the different analyses of these decays done so far @xcite have not yet reported any evidence of physics beyond the sm it seems interesting to reconsider them in the light of our generalization of the electroweak charged current .",
    "for our analysis we have considered the normalized total hadronic width given by the ratio @xmath86 where @xmath87 can be @xmath88 or @xmath89 signifying that we are looking at the vector , axial or strange channel , respectively .",
    "additional information is provided by spectral moments which explore the invariant mass distribution of final state hadrons  @xcite .    the theoretical description of these ratios can be separated into several parts : the electroweak part , a perturbative qcd part and non - perturbative contributions , eventually calculable within the operator product expansion  @xcite .",
    "the qcd corrections are functions of several qcd parameters : @xmath90 , quark masses and non - perturbative condensates .    details of the analysis will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "here we only want to summarize the main results .",
    "an important point is that present data only allow for putting constraints on the parameter @xmath61 in particular from the non - strange , @xmath91 channel and the combination @xmath92 , showing up in the strange channel .",
    "in contrast to @xmath60 , which can be enhanced if there is no strong cabbibo suppression in the right - handed sector , we do not expect any enhancement for these two quantities .",
    "this means that we are looking for effects on the 1% level or even below .",
    "in fact , our knowledge of the qcd parameters entering the analysis has not yet reached a sufficient precision to determine effects of this order .",
    "our conclusion is that presently the analysis of tau decay data does not exclude the presence of rhcs , in particular for the moment there is no evidence for an inconsistency with the expansion within the leet , but on the other hand it does not allow for a quantitative determination of @xmath61 and @xmath93 .",
