    "we considered the final state @xmath46 s to be `` distinguishable , '' when in fact they are identical particles .",
    "in addition to the above simplifications , we also set the masses of the light quarks and the charged lepton to zero .",

    "on the contrary , however , we have found that these expressions provide crucial insights into the actual physical process and serve as a useful starting point for a more robust numerical treatment of the problem .    in refs .",

    "we turn our attention to cp - odd observables .",
    "we proceed in the same manner as we did in refs .",
    "@xcite , working first from theoretical expressions derived under various simplifying assumptions , and turning later to a more robust numerical treatment .",
    "a perusal of the general expressions for the differential and integrated cross sections for @xmath12 shows that that there are two cp - odd combinations if we relax this assumption , but they are suppressed by @xmath47 . ] of np parameters that can be probed in this process , namely im(@xmath48 ) [ eq .",

    "the cp - violating observables that will allow experimentalists to measure the above cp - odd np parameter combinations are as follows .",
    "im(@xmath48 ) is probed using the partial - rate asymmetry , while im(@xmath49 ) appears in triple products and can be probed in several ways . in the following subsections",

    "the simplest cp - odd observable may be obtained by comparing the cross section for the process @xmath13 to that for the conjugate process @xmath50 .",
    "now , cp - violating effects can only arise as a result of the interference of two amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , all signals of direct cp violation , such as the partial - rate asymmetry ( pra ) , are proportional to the cp - odd quantity @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are respectively the weak - phase and strong - phase differences between the two amplitudes . as noted in sec .  [",
    "sec : eff_lag ] , the np strong phases are negligible , so @xmath53 is due entirely to the sm @xmath21-mediated amplitude .",
    "furthermore , the weak phase must arise entirely from np since the sm weak phase is @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the pra is due to sm - np interference .",
    "the only np contribution that interferes with the sm is the @xmath55 term in the effective lagrangian . as a result ,",
    "the pra is proportional to the width of the @xmath21 and to im(@xmath48 ) .",

    "( [ eq : ahatdefs ] ) .    while the presence of the ratio @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pra ] ) leads to a suppression of the pra , it is still possible to obtain an asymmetry whose magnitude is in excess of 10% @xcite . and , despite this suppression , the pra still offers several advantages .",
    "the foremost among these is that it is relatively straightforward to measure , since it does not require a detailed kinematical analysis or the determination of angles in various rest frames .",
    "one simply counts the number of events for the @xmath7 decay in this channel and compares that to the number of events for the @xmath8 decay in the analogous channel .",
    "in fact , since the pra does not require the presence of correlations between the pair - produced @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we need nt be so restrictive regarding the decay mode of the `` other '' particle . that is , we could just as well compare the width for @xmath61 to that for @xmath62 in order to increase statistics ( assuming , of course , that the process and conjugate process could still be distinguished without tagging on the charge of the lepton ) .",
    "we present the numerical results for benchmark np scenarios in sec .",
    "[ sec : pra_sim ] .      in decay processes with two contributing amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the square of the total amplitude may contain interference terms of the form im(@xmath65)[@xmath66 , where each @xmath67 is a spin or a momentum .",
    "these triple products ( tps ) are odd under time reversal ( t ) and hence , by the cpt theorem , also constitute potential signals of cp violation .",

    "the first term is cp - odd , while the second is cp - even , so that the tp is not by itself a signal of cp violation ( this is due to the fact that t is an anti - unitary operator ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the tp in the cp - conjugate process is proportional to ( ab^*)_cp - conj = |a||b| ( - + )  .",
    "[ imab*conj]combining @xmath68 and @xmath69 allows one to isolate the cp - odd piece proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "that is , as with direct cp violation ( the pra ) , in order to obtain a cp - violating signal , one must compare the tp in the process with that in the cp - conjugate process .",
    "however , in contrast to direct cp violation , no strong - phase difference between the interfering amplitudes is required in order to obtain a non - vanishing cp - violating signal ( i.e. @xmath53 can be 0 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that , if the strong phase difference is indeed negligible ( @xmath71 ) , then the cp - even term ( proportional to @xmath72 ) is approximately zero , which then makes the tp a signal of cp - violation by itself .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that , in the presence of np , a tp of the form @xmath73 can be generated in the decay @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath74 denotes the spin of the @xmath7 , and @xmath75 is the momentum of the particle @xmath76 coming from the decay of the @xmath7 .",

    "such an approach can not give access to a quantity such as @xmath73 , however , since the three momenta @xmath75 ( @xmath77 ) are not independent .",
    "the problem can be circumvented by using the fact that , in @xmath5 production , the spins of the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 are statistically correlated  @xcite . as @xmath78 is related to the momenta of the decay products of the @xmath8 , the tp in @xmath2 can be rewritten as a tp involving three final - state momenta of the full process , @xmath79 , and this does not vanish . in practice , this is implemented by introducing the @xmath38 spin - correlation coefficient : @xmath80 here , @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the alignment of the spins of the top and antitop with respect to the chosen spin - quantization axis . as noted above , @xmath74 is related to the momenta , or angular distribution , of the @xmath7 decay products , and similarly for @xmath78 .",
