    "the fact that critical systems tend to display asymptotic scale invariance relates to the existence of nontrivial dimensionless quantities that are independent of the system size , apart from finite - size corrections .",
    "the wrapping probability is an example .",
    "it is defined in graphical representations as the probability that there exists a connected component which wraps around the periodic boundaries , reflecting topological properties of the system under study .",
    "various wrapping probabilities have been studied for the percolation model @xcite , the potts model @xcite , loop models @xcite etc .",
    "they can be related to emergent states of matter such as superfluidity  the superfluid density can be calculated using the winding number @xcite .",
    "many dimensionless quantities are universal at the critical point , in the sense that their critical values are independent of the short - range interactions , lattice types etc . though their values still depend on factors such as the system shape and boundary conditions , the universal dimensionless quantities can be used to characterize universality classes of continuous phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the universality of the wrapping probability has been proven to depend only on the aspect ratio and the boundary twist of the system @xcite .",
    "wrapping probabilities are also very useful in determining the critical temperature for continuous phase transitions @xcite . the well - known binder ratio @xcite is another kind of universal dimensionless quantities whose properties have been widely studied @xcite .    in a recent work @xcite , hu et al .",
    "studied the bond ( site ) percolation model with a fixed total number of occupied bonds ( sites ) .",
    "the system is referred to as in the canonical ensemble ( ce ) , while the model without the constraint is said to be in the grand - canonical ensemble ( gce ) .",
    "it is found that , while the wrapping probabilities and dimensionless ratios share the same values within each of the two different ensembles , some universal quantities in the gce become nonuniversal in the ce , such as the excess cluster number . the percolation model is special , since the occupation of each edge is independent of other edges and the average bond density has no finite - size dependence .",
    "thus we ask whether the universality of observables depends on the ensembles in other models , for which there exist thermal fluctuations that are accompanied by finite - size dependence of the particle density .",
    "we choose to study the potts model @xcite in the random - cluster representation , in which the bonds are treated as particles .",
    "our emphases are on the universality and finite - size scaling ( fss ) of the wrapping probability in the ce , since their universal values at the critical point are exactly known in the gce @xcite , and their fss in the gce is well understood .",
    "moreover , the fact that the wrapping can be defined for each configuration significantly simplifies theoretical derivations , as shown later in the text .    for systems in the ce",
    ", there exists a constraint that the total number of particles is fixed . from fisher renormalization theory @xcite , under this kind of constraint , the system changes its way approaching the critical point as the temperature goes to its critical value , comparing with the asymptotic behavior in the gce .",
    "there is a relation between the temperature field in the ce and that in the gce .",
    "it turns out that there may exist universal changes for critical exponents in such constrained systems : if the specific heat is divergent in the gce , namely @xmath5 with @xmath6 , it will become finite in the ce , with @xmath7 , where  can \" indicates quantities in the ce .",
    "other critical exponents may also be renormalized when @xmath6 , e.g. @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are exponents for the magnetization , susceptibility and correlation length , respectively .",
    "fisher renormalization has been extensively studied and applied to explain experimental results for constrained systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the study of the universality of dimensionless observables in the ce appears to be largely neglected in the literature @xcite .",
    "we conduct a fss analysis for the potts model , and support our analysis by extensive numerical simulations .",

    "<S> universal dimensionless quantities , such as binder ratios and wrapping probabilities , play an important role in the study of critical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we study the finite - size scaling behavior of the wrapping probability for the potts model in the random - cluster representation , under the constraint that the total number of occupied bonds is fixed , so that the canonical ensemble applies . </S>",
    "<S> we derive that , in the limit @xmath0 , the critical values of the wrapping probability are different from those of the unconstrained model , i.e. the model in the grand - canonical ensemble , but still universal , for systems with @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the thermal renormalization exponent and @xmath3 is the spatial dimension . </S>",
    "<S> similar modifications apply to other dimensionless quantities , such as binder ratios . for systems with @xmath4 , these quantities share same critical universal values in the two ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> it is also derived that new finite - size corrections are induced . </S>",
    "<S> these findings apply more generally to systems in the canonical ensemble , e.g. the dilute potts model with a fixed total number of vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we formulate an efficient cluster - type algorithm for the canonical ensemble , and confirm these predictions by extensive simulations .    universal dimensionless quantity ; canonical ensemble ; finite - size scaling ; potts model </S>"
