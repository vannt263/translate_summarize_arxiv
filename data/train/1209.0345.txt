    "the paper presents a kalman - style realization theory for discrete - time affine lpv systems .",
    "an affine lpv system ( _ abbreviated by alpv _ ) is linear parameter - varying systems whose matrices are affine functions of the scheduling parameters . by the input - output behavior of an alpv",
    "we will mean the input - output map induced by the zero initial state .",
    "the paper aims at answering the following questions .    *",
    "how can we characterize those input - output maps which can be described alpvs  ? what is the role of hankel - matrices in this characterization ? * what can be said about minimal alpvs  realizing the given input - output map ? what is the relationship between minimal alpvs , and reachability and observability of such systems ?",
    "are all minimal alpv  realizations of the same input - output map isomorphic ? * how can we characterize the input - output equations solutions of which correspond to input - output maps of alpvs  ?    in this paper",
    "we will show the following .    * we prove that reachability and observability of alpvs  is equivalent to minimality and that minimal realizations of the same input - output map are isomorphic .",
    "note that isomorphism in this setting means a linear state - space transformation which does not depend on the scheduling parameter .",
    "we also show that any alpv  can be transformed into a minimal one while preserving its input - output map .",
    "+ in addition , we characterize reachability and observability in terms of rank conditions for extended reachability and observability matrices . *",
    "we define the markov - parameters as functions of the input - output map .",
    "we then show that the hankel - matrix constructed from the markov - parameters has a finite rank if and only if the corresponding input - output map has a realization by an alpv .",
    "we show that the kalman - ho algorithm of @xcite can be used to compute an alpv  realization from the hankel - matrix , and we provide a bound on the size of the hankel sub - matrices which guarantees correctness of the algorithm .",
    "* we also present a class of input - output equations which characterize alpvs  precisely : an input - output map is a solution of such an input - output equation if and only if it admits a realization by an alpv  . * finally , as a secondary result , we establish a formal equivalence between the realization problems for alpvs  and for linear switched systems .",
    "the solution of the latter problem is known @xcite and it is equivalent to that of recognizable formal power series and state - affine systems @xcite .",
    "we then use realization theory of linear switched systems to derive a kalman - style realization theory for alpvs .    note that in this paper we consider alpvs  with a fixed initial state . just as in",
    "the linear switched case @xcite it is possible to extend these results to the case of an arbitrary set of initial states .",
    "* motivation and novelty * to the best of our knowledge , the paper is new .",
    "many of the concepts ( hankel - matrix , markov - parameters , extended reachability / observability matrix , etc . )",
    "used in the paper have already appeared before .",
    "however , what is truly novel in this paper is that it formulates a kalman - style realization theory for alpvs , while using the existing concepts from the literature .",
    "in addition , the equivalence between alpv  realizations and input - output equations is also new , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "a kalman - like realization theory offers several benefits for system identification .",
    "it allows the characterization of identifiability and equivalence of state - space representations .",
    "the latter is important for model validation .",
    "kalman - like realization theory also provides a tool for finding identifiable canonical parameterizations and characterizing the manifold structure of systems , including hybrid and nonlinear systems , @xcite . in turn",
    ", this knowledge could be used for deriving new parametric identification algorithms , see @xcite for the linear case .",
    "realization theory also leads to model reduction techniques , such as balanced truncation and moment matching @xcite .",
    "this is also true for linear switched systems @xcite and alpvs  @xcite .",
    "finally , the paper formulates the precise relationship between the realization problems for alpvs  and linear switched systems .",
    "while this relationship is part of the folklore , it has not been stated formally yet .",
    "* relationship with existing work * the field of identification of lpv systems is a mature one with a vast literature and several applications , without claiming completeness , we mention @xcite . as it was mentioned before , many of the concepts used in this paper were published before . in particular",
    ", the idea of hankel - matrix appeared in @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite focuses on the identification problem , which is related to , but different from the realization problem studied in this paper .",
    "the markov - parameters were already described in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the existing work , in this paper the markov - parameters and hankel - matrix are defined directly for input - output maps , without assuming the existence of a finite dimensional alpv  realization .",
    "in fact , the finite rank of the hankel - matrix represents the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an alpv  realization .",
    "the kalman - ho realization algorithm was discussed in @xcite , but it was formulated with the assumption that an alpv  realization exists . moreover , the conditions under which the algorithm yields a true realization of the input - output map were not discussed in detail in @xcite . extended observability and reachability matrices were presented in @xcite .",
    "however , their system - theoretic interpretation and relationship with minimality were not explored .",
    "realization theory of more general linear parameter - varying systems was already developed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the system matrices are allowed to depend on the scheduling parameter in a non - linear way . moreover , in @xcite no conditions involving the rank of the hankel - matrix were formulated for the existence of a state - space realization .",
    "hence , the results of @xcite do not always imply the ones presented in this paper .",
    "the minimality conditions of @xcite imply those of this paper .",
    "however , an alpv  may be minimal in the sense of this paper , and may fail to be minimal in the sense of @xcite .",
    "intuitively this is not at all surprising , since it is conceivable that by allowing more complicated dependence on the scheduling parameter we can get rid of some states .",
    "in particular , minimal alpvs  in the sense of this paper are related by constant state - space isomorphism .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite , where the isomorphism relating state - space representations may depend on the scheduling parameter .",
    "note that a minimal alpvs   in the sense of this paper need not be minimal in the sense of @xcite .",
    "hence , there might exist several state - space isomorphisms between alpvs  which are minimal in the sense of this paper .",
    "some of these isomorphisms might depend on the scheduling parameters .",
    "however , the results of this paper imply that there will be a constant state - space isomorphism .",
    "this is also consistent with @xcite .",
    "although realization theory of alpvs  is quite similar to that of linear switched systems , there are important differences .",
    "in particular , there exist no parallel for linear switched systems of the equivalence between realizability and existence of input - output equations .",
    "in fact , alpvs  seem to behave more like state - affine systems @xcite for which an analogous result exists .",
    "it is well known that there is a correspondence between lpvs and lft representations @xcite . in @xcite the theory of recognizable formal power series",
    "was used to develop realization theory for lft representations . in this paper",
    "we reduce the realization problem of alpvs  to that of for linear switched systems .",
    "the latter problem can also be solved by using recognizable formal power series @xcite .",
    "hence , there is an analogy between our approach and that of @xcite .",
    "note that the transformations between alpvs  and lft representations involve non - trivial transformations of the system matrices .",
    "moreover , the resulting class of lft representations seem to differ from the one in @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "it is unclear how the results of this paper could be derived directly from @xcite and whether such an approach would be simpler than the current one .",
