    "in the literature on quantum mechanics , ` decoherence '  refers to the quantum process that turns a coherent pure state into a decohered mixed state , which is diagonal in a well defined basis .",
    "the phenomenon of decoherence is essential in the account of the emergence of classicality from quantum behavior , since it explains how interference vanishes in an extremely short decoherence time .",
    "the orthodox explanation of the phenomenon is given by the so - called _ environment - induced decoherence _",
    "( eid ) approach ( @xcite , zurek-1993 , @xcite , @xcite ) , according to which decoherence is a process resulting from the interaction of an open quantum system and its environment . in particular , by studying different physical models , it is proved that the reduced state @xmath0 of the open system rapidly diagonalizes in a well defined pointer basis , defined case by case but not in general , which identifies the candidates for classical states .",
    "the eid approach has been extensively applied to many areas of physics , such as atomic physics , quantum optics and condensed matter . in particular , the study of decoherence has acquired a great importance in quantum computation , where the phenomenon of decoherence represents a major obstacle to the implementation of information processing hardware that takes advantage of superpositions . in spite of its impressive practical success , from a conceptual viewpoint",
    "the eid approach still faces a difficulty derived from its open - system perspective : the problem of defining the system that decoheres .",
    "> from the einselection view , the split of the universe into the degrees of freedom that are of direct interest to the observer @xmath1the system@xmath1 and the remaining degrees of freedom @xmath1the environment@xmath1 is absolutely essential for decoherence .",
    "however , since the environment may be external ( a bath  of particles interacting with the system of interest ) , internal ( such as collections of phonons or other internal excitations ) or a combination of both cases , the eid approach offers no general criterion for deciding where to place the cut  between system and environment . in many cases",
    ", the lack of such a general criterion leads to the need of assuming in advance the observables that will behave classically .",
    "for instance , in cosmology the usual strategy consists in splitting the universe into some degrees of freedom representing the system  of interest , and the remaining degrees of freedom that are supposed to be non accessible and , therefore , play the role of an internal environment . in quantum field theory ,",
    "when it is known that the background field follows a simple classical behavior , the scalar field is decomposed according to @xmath2 , where the background field @xmath3 plays the role of the system and the fluctuation field @xmath4 plays the role of the environment ( see @xcite ) .",
    "zurek concedes that this absence of a general criterion to discriminate between system and environment is a serious difficulty of his proposal : _ in particular , one issue which has been often taken for granted is looming big , as a foundation of the whole decoherence program .",
    "it is the question of what are the systems  which play such a crucial role in all the discussions of the emergent classicality .",
    "this issue was raised earlier , but the progress to date has been slow at best _  ( see zurek-1998 , p.122 ; for a discussion of this point , see @xcite ) .    the main purpose of this paper is to argue that this looming big  problem is actually a pseudo - problem , which is simply dissolved by the fact that the split of a closed quantum system into an open subsystem and its environment is just a way of selecting a particular space of relevant observables of the whole closed system .",
    "but there are many different spaces of relevant observables depending on the observational viewpoint adopted .",
    "therefore , the same closed system can be decomposed in many different ways : each decomposition represents a decision about which degrees of freedom are relevant and which can be disregarded in each case . since there is no privileged or essential  decomposition , there is no need of an unequivocal criterion for deciding where to place the cut between the  open system and the  environment .  on this basis",
    ", we will show that the usual picture of decoherence in terms of energy dissipation from the  open system to the  environment can no longer be sustained . summing up , decoherence is a phenomenon _ relative _ to the relevant observables selected in each particular case .",
    "the only essential physical fact is that , among all the observational viewpoints that may be adopted to study a quantum system , some of them determine subspaces of relevant observables for which the system decoheres .    for the purpose of this argumentation ,",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii , by means of the concept of tensor product space , it will be shown how the split of a whole closed system into an open system and its environment can be understood as the selection of a space of relevant observables . in sections",
    "iii , iv and v , the well - known spin - bath model studied by the eid approach is presented from the perspective of the previous subsection , and physically relevant numerical simulations are obtained . in sections",
    "vi , vii and viii a generalization of the spin - bath model is presented and solved by computer simulations ; this task will allow us to compare the results obtained for different ways of splitting the entire closed system into an open system and its environment .  in section ix ,",
    "the results obtained in the previous sections are discussed from a conceptual viewpoint in order to argue for the relative nature of decoherence @xmath1which dissolves zurek s looming big  problem@xmath1 and for the rejection of the usual description of decoherence in terms of energy dissipation .",
    "finally , in section x we draw our conclusions .",
    "as it is well - known in the discussions about irreversibility , when a @xmath1classical or quantum@xmath1 state evolves unitarily , it can not follow an irreversible evolution . therefore , if a non - unitary evolution is to be accounted for , a further element has to be added , precisely , the split of the maximal information about the system into a relevant part and an irrelevant part : whereas the irrelevant part is discarded , the relevant part may evolve non - unitarily .",
    "this idea can be rephrased in operators language .",
    "since the maximal information about the system is given by the space @xmath5 of all its possible observables , then we restrict that maximal information to a relevant part by selecting a subspace @xmath6 of relevant observables .",
    "the irreversible evolution is the non - unitary evolution viewed from the perspective of those relevant observables .    as emphasized by omns ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", decoherence is a particular case of irreversible process .",
    "then , the selection of the subspace @xmath7 is always required in decoherence .  in the case of the eid approach , the selection of @xmath8 amounts to the partition of the whole closed system @xmath9 into the open system @xmath10 and its environment @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) . in fact ,",
    "let us consider the hilbert space @xmath12 of the closed system @xmath9 , @xmath13 @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the hilbert space of @xmath10 and @xmath14 the hilbert space of @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding von neumann - liouville space of @xmath9 is @xmath16 @xmath17 , where @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath14 . in the eid approach ,",
    "the relevant observables are those corresponding to the open system @xmath10 : @xmath21where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the identity operator in @xmath24 .  the reduced density operator @xmath25 of @xmath10 is defined by tracing over the environmental degrees of freedom , @xmath26the eid approach studies the time - evolution of @xmath25 governed by an effective master equation ; it proves that , under certain definite conditions , @xmath25 converges to a stable state @xmath27 : @xmath28but we also know that the expectation value of any @xmath29 in the state @xmath30 of @xmath9 can be computed as @xmath31therefore , the convergence of @xmath25 to @xmath27 implies the convergence of the expectation values : @xmath32where @xmath33 is a final diagonal state of the closed system @xmath9 , such that @xmath34 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) ; for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that , although the off - diagonal terms of @xmath30 never vanish through the unitary evolution , decoherence obtains because it is a _ coarse - grained process _ : the system decoheres _ from the observational point of view _ given by any observable belonging to the space @xmath8 .",
    "when viewed from this closed - system perspective , the discrimination between system and environment turns out to be the selection of the relevant observables . by following papers @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we will use the expression ` _ _ tensor product structure _ _ '  ( tps ) to call any factorization @xmath35 of a hilbert space @xmath12 , defined by the set of observables @xmath36 , such that the eigenbases of the sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 are bases of @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "if @xmath12 corresponds to a closed system @xmath9 , the tps @xmath41 can be viewed as representing the decomposition of @xmath9 into two open systems @xmath42 and @xmath43 , corresponding to the hilbert spaces @xmath39 and @xmath44 respectively . in turn , given the space @xmath45 of the observables of @xmath9 , such a decomposition identifies the spaces @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the observables of the open systems @xmath42 and @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "once these concepts are considered , the selection of the space @xmath8 of relevant observables in the eid approach turns out to amount to the selection of a particular tps , @xmath51 , such that @xmath52 .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the particular case where the closed system @xmath53 is composed of @xmath54 spin-1/2 particles @xmath55 , each represented in its hilbert space @xmath56:@xmath57it is quite clear that the system @xmath9 can be decomposed into two subsystems @xmath58 and @xmath11 in different ways , depending on which particles are considered as the open system @xmath10 .",

    "the irony of this story is that such a problem is the consequence of what has been considered to be the main advantage of the decoherence program : its open - system perspective .",

    "given the closed system @xmath9 , that identification requires two steps : ( i ) to select a tps @xmath486 , such that @xmath487 , and ( ii ) to decide that one of the systems resulting from the decomposition , say @xmath42 , is the open system @xmath10 , and the other , @xmath48 , is the environment @xmath488 .",
    "since the tps is defined by the spaces of observables @xmath479 and @xmath480 , the decomposition of @xmath9 is just the adoption of a descriptive perspective : the identification of @xmath10 and @xmath11 amounts to the selection of the observables relevant in each situation .",
    "but since the split can be performed in many ways , with no privileged or essential decomposition , there is no need of an unequivocal criterion for deciding where to place the cut between thesystem and the  environment .",
    "decoherence is not a yes - or - not process , but a phenomenon _ relative _ to the chosen decomposition of the whole closed quantum system . when viewed from this closed - system perspective",
    ", zurek s looming big problem  does not constitute a real threat to the decoherence program : the supposed challenge dissolves once the relative nature of decoherence is taken into account .",
    "> from this perspective , quantum mechanics is a theory whose dynamical postulate refers to closed systems : the time - behavior of the parts resulting from different partitions of the closed system has to be inferred from that postulate . since the total hamiltonian rules the dynamical evolution of the closed system , then the time - behavior of its open subsystems depends on the form in which the hamiltonian is decomposed in each particular partition .",
    "this means that decoherence can not be simply described as the result of an interaction through which a small open system @xmath1typically , a particle@xmath1 dissipates its energy into a large environmental bath . as we have seen in the generalized spin - bath model , this picture of decoherence leads to perplexities : the relationships between the whole closed system and its open subsystems is subtler than that picture suggests ( in a future paper we will study those relationships from a theoretical viewpoint in order to draw some general conclusions regarding decoherence ) .",
    "therefore , the decomposition of the total hamiltonian has to be studied in detail in each particular case , in order to know whether the system of interest resulting from the partition of the whole closed system decoheres or not under the action of its self - hamiltonian and the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the aim of this paper has been to argue that decoherence can be viewed from a closed - system perspective , which improves the understanding of the phenomenon . for this purpose",
    ", we have analyzed the simple spin - bath model by studying the time - behavior of the expectation values of relevant observables belonging to different sets .",
    "then , we have generalized the original model in order to see how decoherence depends on the way in which the relevant observables are selected .      1 .",
    "decoherence is a phenomenon relative to which degrees of freedom of the whole closed system are considered relevant and which are disregarded in each case .",
    "the explanation of decoherence requires the detailed study of the interaction hamiltonian resulting from the selected partition of the whole closed system .",
    "3 .   although it is usually claimed that eid is a dissipative approach to decoherence , the simple account of decoherence in terms of energy dissipation from the open system to its environment is misguided , to the extent that there are situations where all the particles of a closed system decohere when considered independently .",
    "since there is no privileged or essential decomposition of the closed system , there is no need of an unequivocal criterion for identifying the systems involved in decoherence .",
    "therefore , the looming big problem , which , according to zurek , poses a serious threat to the whole decoherence program , looses its strength in the light of the relative nature of decoherence ."
