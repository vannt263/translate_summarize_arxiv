    "the high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) are a population of neutral hydrogen clouds with lsr velocities of 80 - 400 km s@xmath6 ( muller et al . 1963 ) . despite nearly four decades of study , the nature of the clouds is still a matter of some debate ( see , e.g. , wakker & van woerden 1997 ; putman & gibson 1999 ) at least partly because of the difficulty in measuring distances to hvcs . without distances ,",
    "the nature of the hvcs ",
    "e.g. , whether they are a galactic or extragalactic phenomenon  can only be ascertained by indirect means .",
    "it is clear that the dominant hvc feature ",
    "the 100@xmath7 long magellanic stream  is the result of interaction between the magellanic clouds and the milky way , either as a result of tidal disruption or ram - pressure stripping or both ( wannier & wrixon 1972 ; matthewson , clearly & murray 1974 ; putman et al .",
    "1998 , 2003 ; putman & gibson 1999 ) .",
    "some hvcs , particularly complex c , have been attributed to gas falling onto the milky way from similar but perhaps smaller - scale interactions ( larson 1972 ; tosi 1988 ; gibson et al .",
    "2001 ; tripp et al . 2003 ) while other hvcs are ascribed as the product of galactic fountains ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 , 1996 ) .",
    "the compact high velocity clouds ( chvcs ) are possibly the most contentious subset of hvcs .",
    "it has been proposed that the chvcs could be the `` missing satellites '' of the local group ( see discussion in braun & burton 1999 and 2000 , hereafter bb99 and bb00 ; blitz et al .",
    "1999 ; de heij et al .",
    "2002a ; maloney & putman 2002 ; maller & bullock 2004 ) , whose existence is presumed on the basis of their formation in n - body simulations of structure formation in the presence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "these simulations predict the mass distribution of the local group to follow a power law @xmath8 where @xmath9 is at least 2 ( see , e.g. , klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "such a spectrum would imply the existence of several hundred low mass dwarfs in the local group , an order of magnitude more than detected , despite a number of optical surveys for low surface brightness members ( mateo 1998 ; armandroff et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; karachentseva & karachentsev 1998 , 2000 ; karachentsev & karachentseva 1999 ; karachentsev et al . 2000 ; whiting et al .",
    "2002 ; willman et al .",
    "this contradiction would resolve if the local group were filled with dark galaxies  objects containing dark matter but few , if any , stars , perhaps because of inhibition of star formation in the early universe ( see , e.g. , bullock et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the chvcs kinematical preference for the local group standard of rest ( bb99 ) and the existence of a small overdensity of clouds toward m31 with high negative velocities ( burton et al .",
    "2002 ; de heij et al .",
    "2002a ) suggest local group scale distances .",
    "high resolution mapping ( bb00 ; burton et al .",
    "2002 ) shows several chvcs to have core - halo morphology , similar to that expected for dark matter - dominated mini - halos .",
    "three independent methods yield distance estimates for some hvcs of @xmath10 0.2 - 0.7 mpc ( bb99 ; bb00 ; burton et al . 2001 ; robishaw et al .",
    "the chvcs also show velocity gradients along their major axes with implied rotation speeds of @xmath11 km s@xmath6 ( bb99 ; bb00 ; burton et al .",
    "2001 ) as well as high internal velocity dispersions .",
    "both phenomena imply high dark matter content ( bb00 ) , assuming the hvcs are virialized .",
    "conversely , the sky distribution of chvcs appears inconsistent with a local group origin ( putman et al .",
    "2002 ; cf .",
    "b99 and de heij et al .",
    "2002a ) and chvcs are not definitively seen in extragalactic groups ( de blok et al .",
    "2002 ; zwann 2001 ; banks et al . 1999 ; pisano et al .",
    "2004 ; cf .",
    "braun & burton 2001 ) .",
    "maloney & putman ( 2003 ) evaluated the effect of extragalactic ionizing radiation on the chvcs and concluded that the properties of chvcs are more consistent with a galactic halo origin than a cosmological one . and",
    "while anomalous hydrogen clouds have been found in nearby galaxies ( m31 ; thilker et al .",
    "2004 : m53 and m81 ; miller & bregman 2004 ) , these clouds are closer to their parent galaxies than would be likely for dark galaxies .",
    "one puzzling aspect of chvcs are the chemical abundances .",
    "they are about a tenth solar , a value too low for galactic fountain models ( wakker et al . 1999 ; bb99 ; bb00 ) but too high for protogalactic fragments , given the lack of recent star formation in hvcs ( blitz et al .",
    "1999 ; bb99 ; bb00 ) .",
    "it might be consistent , however , with a tidal or ram - pressure stripping origin since many local group dwarfs have abundances near this range .",
    "the detection of stars in hvcs would open a new dimension to their study and quickly resolve many uncertainties , including their distance and chemical enrichment history . additionally , if the chvcs were discovered to have stellar populations while the hvcs did",
    "not , this would clearly indicate that different mechanisms were responsible for the formation of the compact and non - compact hvcs .",
    "if the hvcs were within one mpc of the milky way , they would have red giant stars bright enough to be detected with modest aperture telescopes .",
    "a number of recent studies have searched for hvc stars .",
    "willman et al . ( 2002 ) surveyed a small number of hvcs that were included in the sloan digital sky survey and found no indication of stellar content .",
    "hopp et al . ( 2003 ) surveyed only chvcs , combining deep vlt imaging with data from the 2mass survey and comparing each chvc to a nearby control field .",
    "the @xmath12 data rule out significant stellar content to a distance of 2 mpc , although they cover small regions of each cloud .",
    "the 2mass data cover much larger areas of sky , but would only detect giant stars to a distance of 300 kpc .",
    "the most complete survey , by simon & blitz ( 2002 ) , also focused on chvcs and failed to detect any stellar content .",
    "this study placed a lower limit of 100 kpc on the distance to 250 chvcs and even greater lower limits ( 300 - 1400 kpc ) on the distance to 60 chvcs .",
    "the simon & blitz survey searched poss plates for enhancements of stellar density at the positions of the chvcs and followed up potential detections with monochromatic observations in the spinrad @xmath13 filter .",
    "though impressive in scale , the simon & blitz survey was biased toward larger hvc stellar populations with densities that could rise above the statistical noise of the foreground of milky way stars .",
    "diffuse , low surface brightness systems are a much greater challenge to identify against the poissonian noise of dense foreground / background galactic starcounts . to find such structures requires observational strategies that increase their detectability .",
    "in this article , we present the first search for _ low surface - brightness _ stellar populations in hvcs , a search based on the observational strategy of minimizing the effects of galactic contamination .",
    "our photometric survey of four hvcs and adjacent control fields utilizes a filter system especially sensitive to red giant / supergiant stars  the primary stellar type sought in distant hvcs ( and a stellar type found in stellar populations of all ages and metallicities )  and that allows a large fraction of galactic stellar contaminants  which will be dominated by main sequence stars  to be identified and eliminated .",
    "the substantially reduced background / foreground makes it possible to look for very tenuous chvc stellar populations that would be swamped within simple starcount analyses . for one of our target hvcs and control fields",
    "we supplement our photometric analysis with radial velocities derived from echelle spectroscopy of the brightest giant star candidates . ",
    "2 of this paper details the observation and reduction of our photometric observations . ",
    "3 presents an analysis of these data and attempts to quantify the residual sources of possible `` noise '' in our program after elimination of the bulk of the likely galactic dwarf stars .",
    " 4 details the spectroscopic work on the brighter giant candidates in one of the hvcs , work that confirms the basic analysis of  3 .",
    " 5 defines the limits that our survey places on the distances of any stellar populations in the hvcs .",

    "the unexposed areas of the chip consist entirely of ccd noise and can render normal pipeline analysis difficult .",

    ", the unexposed regions occasionally extended beyond the nominal mask .",
    "these `` noisy edges '' were generally small ( @xmath21 of the total chip area ) but produced hundreds of `` detections '' during photometry .",
    "the detections from the noisy edges were clearly non - stellar and were easily removed by our stringent morphological classification ( see  3 )",
    ". a re - analysis of our data with more restrictive masking that excludes more of the field edges showed no change in the starcount density .",
    "we derived photometric measures with the daophot / allframe psf photometry package ( stetson 1987 , 1994 ) .",
    "the psfs were fit with a quadratically varying moffat function .",

    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 filter system is now well - established for its ability to distinguish late - type high surface gravity dwarf stars from late - type , low surface gravity , evolved giant stars through the use of two color diagrams ( majewski et al .",

    "our data reach a magnitude or more deeper than @xmath27 . however , data fainter than @xmath28 have larger uncertainties and less reliable morphological classification .",

    "figure 2 shows the run of photometric error with magnitude for our data .",
    "we apply magnitude error limits to remove obviously poor measures but retain the bulk of the stars .",
    "the adopted magnitude error limits are @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 0.06 for the du pont data and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 0.035 for the mayall data .",
    "figure 3 shows color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of our four hvcs and their corresponding control fields . because they are at similar galactic latitudes ,",
    "are dominated by milky way stars , and have identical quality data , the hvc and control field cmds look similar .",
    "the cmds clearly show that the hvcs fields do not contain young stars ( at least if they are closer than a few hundred kpc , a limit that depends on the age of the main sequence turnoff [ msto ] ) since no obvious main sequences project blueward of the `` blue edge '' of the old , metal - poor halo stars at @xmath33 .",
    "( the slight blueward shift of the blue edge at faint magnitudes is a result of the transition to the more metal - poor populations of the inner halo and thick disk . )",
    "this is not altogether surprising , since the previous optical searches of hvcs ( b99 ; b00 ; simon & blitz 2002 ) have already placed tighter constraints on the absence of young stars in hvcs than our data by virtue of the greater number of clouds surveyed , deeper photometry and/or larger spatial area .",
    "the principal advantage of our program is the degree to which we can detect old or intermediate age stellar populations  particularly very diffuse ones .",
    "such populations would have rgbs well redward of the blue edge .",
    "ordinarily , with simple starcount techniques , a weak rgb might easily be swamped by the foreground of red galactic dwarf stars and fall below the detection threshold of the previous surveys .",
    "our program overcomes this problem by severely reducing the galactic foreground .",
    "the basic premise of the three - filter selection method is that late - type giants and dwarfs occupy different loci in color - color space ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the dwarf stars lie along the arc of stars at negative @xmath34 that traces the strength of magnesium absorption as a function of effective temperature in high surface - gravity , main sequence stars .",
    "low surface - gravity giants lie above this curve in general , offset to a degree dependent upon metallicity ( majewski et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "we interactively fit a sixth order polynomial to @xmath35 as a function of @xmath36 over the limit @xmath37 .",
    "we gradually removed outliers from this function so that it eventually was entirely defined by stars along the dwarf sequence .",
    "once this system was defined , we derived each star s distance from the nominal dwarf function as :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the  best - fitting \" locus to the dwarf stars in the two - color diagram .",
    "we then flagged any star with @xmath40 and a positive @xmath41 value greater than three times its photometric error ( @xmath42 ) as a potential giant .",
    "this approach provides some distinct advantages over previous efforts that used rigidly defined selection regions in color - color space to select giant candidates ( see majewski et al .",
    "2000a , b ; morrison et al . 2001",
    "; palma et al .",
    "first , if the errors are gaussian , each giant candidate selected by the above method is 99.7% likely to have photometry placing it genuinely outside the nominal dwarf locus .",
    "second , we obtain an immediate analytical estimate for the contamination level as 0.3% of the total number of stars .",
    "third , even if the errors are not gaussian or are underestimated , the number of stars with _ negative _ @xmath41 values greater than @xmath43 gives a second , robust estimate of the photometric contamination level .",
    "finally , by removing the constraints of rigidly defined selection limits , a star with exceptional photometry is flagged as a giant even if only a short distance from the nominal dwarf locus while a star with poor photometry must pass correspondingly more stringent requirements to be selected as a potential giant .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath41 versus @xmath0 distribution of the stars in our eight hvc and control fields .",
    "the trend is roughly linear , with growing dispersion as the faint end .",
    "stars flagged as giants and negative outliers are marked .",
    "figure 6 shows the color - color diagram of our giant and negative outlier stars .",
    "note that the reddest giant candidates are nearly within the apparent dwarf locus .",
    "these are stars with exceptionally small photometric uncertainties .",
    "table 2 lists the number of giant candidates in each hvc and its corresponding control field , while figure 7 shows the cmds of the giant star candidates in the hvcs .",
    "the advantage of our method becomes immediately obvious from comparing the raw starcounts to giant star candidate counts in table 2 or by comparing figure 7 to figure 3 .",
    "the screening for giant star candidates reduces the foreground dramatically  by more than an order of magnitude in all eight cases .",
    "a @xmath43 surface brightness enhancement would have to be 60 - 200 stars strong to show up in the raw starcounts or uncleaned cmd .",
    "however , figure 7 and the last columns of table 2 would easily reveal the signature of even a handful of hvc rgb stars , with a @xmath43 surface brightness enhancement corresponding to only 5 - 25 stars , an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity .",
    "the hvc fields have a significant number of giant candidates that , on first blush , would appear to show a stellar population in the hvcs .",
    "however , the control fields provide a critical second constraint .",
    "the hvc fields show no excess of giant candidates over the control fields .",
    "in fact , three of the hvc fields have _ fewer _ giant candidates than their control fields .",
    "the color - magnitude distribution of giant candidates in the hvcs and their corresponding control fields are similar , although they show a number of interesting features .",
    "most of the giant candidates are toward the fainter end of the data , where contamination by extragalactic objects and photometric errors is most likely .",
    "however , chvc 017 - 25 - 218 and its control field also show a diffuse clump of bright stars around @xmath44 .",
    "if bona fide giants , these bright stars would be at distances of 40 - 100 kpc and therefore well within the bounds of the outer milky way halo .",
    "there are few giant candidates with colors near the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb )  typically found at colors of @xmath45 for the metallicity range @xmath46 \\leq -0.5 $ ] ( see table 5 ) and no obvious rgb in any of our fields .",
    "the only potential trgb stars are in the control field of hvc 271 + 29 + 181 .",
    "this field shows a clump of stars near ( @xmath47 ) as well as a sprinkling of brighter red stars .",
    "the latter we have found to be field star contaminants ( see  4 ) while the latter could be a very distant ( @xmath48 kpc ) , very dispersed rgb tip .    in any case",
    ", it is clear that the hvcs are not host to any significant stellar population  and our discussions and analysis below suggest that they are not likely even to host _ meager _ stellar populations .",
    "the most likely explanation for the presence of  giant star candidates \" in our fields is that these candidates are either field giants from the galactic halo , or represent contamination of the giant sample by non - giants .",
    "we now quantify these contributions and in  4 show that the radial velocity distribution in one of our fields is consistent with that of galactic field stars .",
    "as discussed above , our new method of giant star selection should provide an immediate evaluation of the photometric contamination of the giant star region in the two - color diagram .",
    "table 3 lists , for each field , the number of contaminants expected given the 3@xmath49 selection criterion and the number of stars with negative @xmath41 values greater than 3@xmath49 . for several fields , the latter number is significantly greater than the former .",
    "this is a result of the modest quality of the wfc psf .",
    "a disproportionate number of the negative @xmath41 stars are located near the chip edges where the quadratic psf is not quite adequate .",
    "we use the greater of the two numbers to represent the level of photometric contamination , thus providing a conservative estimate for the number of _ bona fide _ giant stars within our candidate sample .",
    "another potential source of sample contamination is subdwarf stars .",
    "our candidate selection is based on the presumption that the observed weaker magnesium absorption in these stars is due to surface gravity effects .",
    "however , very metal - poor ( @xmath50 \\leq -2.0 $ ] ) halo subdwarfs may contain so little magnesium that their absorption lines are intrinsically weak and therefore insensitive to surface gravity .",
    "such stars would also fall into the giant region of the two - color diagram .",
    "morrison et al . ( 2001 ) estimated this contamination level to be small at bright magnitudes but to grow rapidly at faint magnitudes , depending on the @xmath51 of the field . using their figure 2",
    ", we estimate that our fields should each contain approximately ten subdwarfs , with the exception of hvc 017 - 25 - 218 , which should contain approximately 20 subdwarfs .",
    "this could provide a substantial fraction of the excess `` giant candidates '' in table 2 .",
    "the light from distant galaxies has a significant , perhaps even dominant contribution , from giant stars ( see , e.g. bershady 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , at high enough redshifts , the magnesium features can shift out of the @xmath2 passband , resulting in bluer @xmath34 colors .",
    "an examination of the non - compact objects in our photometry shows that they primarily occupy the giant region , a result we have seen in other deep photometry samples that use this filter system .",
    "our structural parameters should limit galaxy contamination . however , _ compact , star - like _ extragalactic objects , which are expected to contaminate photometric samples at a level of @xmath52 degree@xmath53 to @xmath54 ( kron et al .",
    "1991 ) , could remain in the sample . of course , only a small fraction of compact galaxies have colors red enough to fall into our selection region in the two - color diagram .",
    "to estimate the contribution of compact galaxies to the giant star selection region , we took quasar counts from a recent analysis of the sloan digital sky survey ( richards et al .",
    "we transformed the @xmath55 color limits of our giant selection region ( @xmath40 ) to approximate @xmath56 colors ( @xmath57 ) using transformations in majewski et al .",
    "( 2000b ) and fukugita et al .",
    "approximately 10 - 15% of the richards et al .",
    "sample fall into this color range resulting in a compact galaxy contamination level of @xmath58 degree@xmath53 in each of our fields , which would be three galaxies for each wfc field and nine for the mosaic fields .",
    "this estimate would probably be a lower bound for the 2.5-meter data , which reaches a depth of @xmath29 and may suffer from more extragalactic contamination owing to the mediocre psf and commensurately lower quality morphological classification .",
    "on the other hand , it is probably an upper bound for the 4-meter data given its brighter magnitude limit and superior imaging capability . we choose to split the difference and apply a uniform compact galaxy contamination level of five objects per field .",
    "the @xmath14 band photometry in three of our hvcs provides an observational test of this approximation .",
    "these data were obtained because @xmath59 colors would allow us , had we found a coherent rgb in any of our fields , to place constraints on the metallicity of the giant stars using the iso - metallicity lines derived by geisler et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . however , the two - color diagram ( figure 8) shows something unexpected .",
    "many of the giant candidates have far bluer @xmath59 colors than even very metal - poor populations .",
    "we find that many of the non - compact galaxies in our photometry also occupy this region of color - color space .",
    "moreover , the star - like objects most displaced from the iso - metallicity lines are preferentially nearer to the faint limit of the data  where galaxy contamination is expected to be strongest .",
    "our interpretation is that some of our faintest giant star candidates are compact galaxies and fall into the giant region as a result of their composite spectral energy distribution being dominated by giants , or by being at high enough redshift to shift their magnesium features out of the @xmath2 band .",
    "the giant candidates that fall along the iso - metallicity lines in figure 8 are far more likely to be bona fide giants or subdwarfs .",
    "significantly , the number of giant candidates substantially removed from the iso - metallicity lines appears to be approximately 1 - 10 per field , consistent with the number of extragalactic contaminants estimated above .      as mentioned above , the brighter giant candidates are likely from the galaxy itself .",
    "we estimate the number of galactic field giants for each field by numerically integrating the fundamental equation of stellar statistics ( von seeliger 1898 ) using the density laws derived by siegel et al .",

    "the number of total estimated contributed galactic giant stars is listed in the fourth column of table 3 .",
    "this includes contributions from the inner halo , thick disk and bulge .",

    "column six lists the difference between the predicted contamination level and the actual number of giant candidates .",
    "although these numbers come with substantial uncertainties , the comparison shows some patterns .",
    "hvc 030 - 51 - 119 and hvc 267 + 26 + 216 appear to have fewer giant candidates than predicted ; their control fields match the predictions almost exactly .",
    "on the other hand , the two compact hvcs have a clear excess of giant candidates beyond the expected contamination level , an excess matched in their control fields .",
    "these discrepancies are larger than the statistical noise of the sample .",
    "the potential implications are discussed in  5 .",
    "in order to test the nature of the giant star candidates , we obtained spectra of twelve giant star candidates in chvc 271 + 29 + 181 and its control field on ut january 27 - 28 2004 using the 6.5-m clay telescope at las campanas with the mike spectrograph .",
    "chvc 271 + 29 + 181 is one of the two fields in which both the hvc and control field have a clear excess of giant candidates beyond the predicted contamination level .",
    "the resolution of the echelle spectrograph is approximately @xmath60 in the red orders . to derive radial velocities",
    ", we used three orders extending from the atmospheric bands near 8300   to the calcium ir triplet .",
    "details of the radial velocity measurement technique can be found in majewski et al .",
    "( 2004a ) . in brief",
    ", radial velocities were derived using cross - correlation against a  universal \" template masked down to a series of lines that confer the most power in the cross - correlation , and eliminating the vast portions of the spectrum that contain mostly continuum and therefore contribute little more than noise in the cross - correlation .",
    "residual systematic offsets in the velocities were calibrated by observations of k giant velocity standards .",
    "the hvc radial velocities thus obtained were subsequently corrected for slit - centering errors by a second cross - correlation focused on the atmospheric absorption bands .",
    "the resultant precision on the radial velocities from this multi - step process is better than 1 km s@xmath6 .",
    "table 4 presents the heliocentric radial velocities for the brightest giant star candidates in chvc 271 + 29 + 181 and its control field .",
    "also listed in the table is the strength of each star s correlation peak , a quality indicator from 0 ( worst ) to 7 ( best ) of the spectral quality as well as the de - reddened @xmath0 magnitude and @xmath61 color .",
    "the most important aspect of the radial velocity distribution is the lack of stars at the radial velocity of chvc 271 + 29 + 181 ( @xmath62=+181 km s@xmath6 ; @xmath63=+191 km s@xmath6 ) . the star nearest this radial velocity is 25 km s@xmath6 away and is likely to be a star from the galactic stellar halo . _",
    "we believe that none of our spectroscopically observed giant candidates is associated with the hvc .",
    "_     3 and table 3 indicate that approximately half of the giant candidates in chvc 271 + 29 + 181 are galactic field stars ( subdwarfs , stars with photometric errors and _ bona fide _ galactic giants ) .",
    "the origin of the remaining half is unclear .",
    "however , our spectroscopic sample is bright and therefore expected to be heavily dominated by galactic field stars .",
    "the excess of giant candidates is more prevalent at fainter magnitudes .",
    "figure 9 shows the radial velocity distribution of the stars and confirms that these are indeed galactic field stars . at the @xmath51 of chvc 271 + 29 + 181",
    "the heliocentric radial velocities of any galactic field stars will primarily reflect circular velocity differences .",
    "one would expect roughly three groupings of stars : a thin disk contribution near 0 km s@xmath6 , a thick disk with a contribution near 50 km s@xmath6 and a halo contribution near 220 km s@xmath6 ( see , e.g. casertano et al .",
    "figure 9 shows that the radial velocity distribution is roughly consistent with this . the spectroscopically observed stars lie principally between -5 and 115 km s@xmath6 with a couple of stars at higher , halo - like radial velocities , including star 146 , which is in retrograde rotation .",
    "it is not surprising that these stars are galactic field stars .",
    "inspection of figure 7 shows that the brightest giants in these two fields are either very red or very blue , where the contamination from photometric error and subdwarfs is expected to be the worst .",
    "indeed , five of the six stars in the control field are at the red end and only slightly removed from the dwarf locus in the two - color diagram , which would suggest that using a more rigid cut - off at the red end of the data may be more appropriate in the future .",
    "of course , the most interesting stars in chvc 271 + 29 + 181 are the faint , moderately red stars that represent the true excess above the expected contamination level , particularly the clump at ( @xmath47 ) in the control field . future spectroscopy of these stars will help to determine their nature .",
    "previous searches for stellar populations in hvcs have concluded that there are not significant populations of stars in hvcs .",
    "our survey of four hvcs here , meant to identify diffuse populations of giant stars , suggests that there may not even be _ insignificant _ populations of stars in hvcs . in  3 and  4",
    "we show that the small number of giant candidates we have identified along the line of sight to each of the hvcs we studied are likely to be field stars from the standard galactic stellar populations .",
    "our survey can not , however , rule out the possibility of a stellar counterpart to the hvcs that might be _ displaced _ from our probes .",
    "our survey probes consist of a single hvc and control field pair for each target and , these imaged fields actually cover a small fraction of each hvc ( see figure 1 ) . were an hvc stellar population _ both _ spatially concentrated in its radial distribution _ and _ centered away from the center of the hi gas , we could erroneously infer a lack of stars .",
    "ram - pressure stripping , tidal stripping and/or supernovae can potentially separate gas from stars and the halo abounds with examples .",
    "the most famous high velocity cloud  the magellanic stream  is substantially separated from the stellar population of the lmc .",
    "gallart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue for association of the phoenix dwarf with an hi cloud that only partly overlaps the stellar populations .",
    "the sculptor dsph has disconnected clumps of gas at similar velocities ( carignan et al .",
    "1998 ) , although this may be foreground contamination by the magellanic stream ( putman et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it is possible that some of the excess stars in our data , particularly in the control fields , could represent a stellar population displaced from the center of the hi",
    ". the aforementioned clump of stars at ( @xmath47 ) in the control field of chvc 271 + 29 + 181 could be the rgb tip of a displaced stellar population .",
    "only further spectroscopy of the giant candidates can eliminate this possibility .    although ours is the most sensitive probe so far for diffuse stellar populations",
    ", it is important to be clear about the upper limits on hvc stellar populations that our null results place . though the distance , spatial distribution and mass function of any hypothetical hvc stellar populations are unknown , a few basic assumptions allow us to derive useful order - of - magnitude limits .",
    "we first define the distance to which we would be able to detect trgb stars .",
    "we estimated trgb colors and magnitudes from the synthetic photometry of ostheimer ( 2003 ) for a variety of old stellar populations .",
    "the trgb @xmath55 color and @xmath64 absolute magnitudes are given in table 5 for various metallicities .",
    "table 5 also lists minimum distances of a trgb at which it would be fainter than @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    beyond 550 - 760 kpc , rgb stars would be too faint for our program .",
    "for an hvc at a hypothetical distance less than these limits , however , we can make a rough analytical approximation of the hvc stellar mass implied by any detected giant stars . at distance",
    "@xmath65 , the absolute magnitude of the trgb ( @xmath66 ) corresponds to an observed apparent magnitude @xmath67 .",
    "the limiting magnitude of our sample @xmath68 , in turn , corresponds to an absolute magnitude at distance @xmath65 of @xmath69 .",
    "an estimate of the number of hvc giant candidates between @xmath70 and @xmath68 allows us to integrate over the luminosity function and spatial distribution of the hypothetical hvc stellar population to estimate a total stellar mass .",
    "the number of stars used for this exercise would optimally be taken from the excess of hvc field stars against control field stars .",
    "however , the _ deficit _ of giant candidates in the hvcs compared with their control fields precludes this . as noted above , however , the two chvc fields and their control fields have approximately 3 and 7 @xmath49 more giant candidates than the predicted contamination level .",
    "we therefore calculate implied stellar masses for these two chvcs by taking the number of giant stars as the lower of either the excess of giant candidates or the total number of stars fainter than @xmath70 .",
    "we also run calculations for all four hvcs assuming that only _ one _ star in the entire sample represented the hvc stellar population .",
    "the latter calculation is a useful benchmark of the upper limit to the hvc stellar mass .",
    "we integrate the number of giants over the complete global luminosity function of m3 ( rood et al .",
    "1999 ) , assuming that any local group object would have an lf similar to that of globular clusters ( see , e.g. , feltzing et al .",
    "we convert the lf to washington colors via the transformations in majewski et al .",
    "2000b ) , and assume an exponential spatial distribution with scalelength equal to the hwhm of the hi gas and axial ratio similar to that of the hi gas .",
    "figure 10 shows the upper limit on stellar mass in the hvcs plotted against distance .",
    "the solid lines show the fundamental limitation of our survey .",
    "a single hvc star in our sample would imply stellar masses of a few @xmath5 .",
    "chvc 017 - 25 - 218 is close to its fundamental limit , owing to the comparatively small size of the hvc and the brightness of its excess giant candidates .",
    "chvc 271 + 29 + 181 has a higher potential stellar mass ( @xmath71 @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , this higher mass limit is a result of the large number of faint giant candidates in and large spatial extent of the hvc .",
    "we emphasize that these are upper limits and that the chvc stellar content is likely well below this limit , if it exists at all .",
    "our predicted giant star candidate counts match the observed counts reasonably well ( see table 3 ) .",
    "however , the two compact hvcs show an interesting statistical signature .",
    "chvc 017 - 25 - 218 and its control field both have approximately 3@xmath49 more giant candidates than predicted while chvc 271 + 29 + 181 and its control field have 3@xmath49 and 7@xmath49 more giant candidates , respectively .",
    "_ it is unlikely that these stars are associated with the clouds themselves _ , as show in the lack of excess in the chvc central fields over the controls .",
    "however , these stars may still be interesting objects in their own right .",
    "our interest is particularly drawn to the clump of stars at ( @xmath47 ) in the control field of chvc 271 + 29 + 191 , which could be the tip of a very distant rgb .    one important caveat in the galactic model used in  3.4 , as noted in siegel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , is that the halo often defies conventional density laws .",
    "siegel et al . argued for two halo populations  a smooth inner halo ( which we model ) and a highly structured outer halo ( which we ca nt and do nt ) , possibly comprised of coherent streams of stellar debris from disrupted dwarf galaxies and/or globular clusters .",
    "several recent studies using our washington system have found groups of distant giant stars that are not clearly associated with any known dwarf galaxies or globular clusters .",
    "muoz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have recently identified a velocity coherent group of halo giants in the line of sight of the carina dsph galaxy , but which are not associated with the core of that object . in a study around the magellanic clouds , majewski et al .",
    "( in preparation ; see also majewski 2004 ) show that , at large galactocentric distances , the galactic stellar halo may be _ dominated _ by coherent streams of stars , presumably tidally stripped by the milky way from dwarf galaxies or globular clusters .",
    "the majewski et al .",
    "fields do _ not _ show clear rgb structure in the cmd because the streams are diffuse ",
    "a result eerily similar to what we have found in our two chvc fields .",
    "additionally , ostheimer s ( 2002 ) deep washington photometry survey of m31 uncovered numerous examples of potentially _",
    "giant star candidates , as well as one coherent halo substructure at a distance of about 20 kpc ( majewski et al .",
    "2004b ) , now confirmed by a strong msto feature in his survey data .",
    "interestingly , even this latter ,  triangulum - andromeda \" structure does not exhibit a strongly identifiable rgb in the cmd , but one that is more subtle ( rocha - pinto et al . 2004 ) .",
    "these precedents make it possible to infer that the excesses in the hvc fields may represent distant diffuse star streams in the outer halo that just happen to cross our survey fields .",
    "chvc 017 - 25 - 218 is particularly interesting because its candidate giants are bright .",
    "while the hvc and control fields each have approximately twenty giant candidates fainter than @xmath73  a number consistent with subdwarf , extragalactic and photometric contamination  each of these fields also has approximately forty giant candidates brighter than @xmath73 , which is nearly five times the expected contribution from the canonical galactic models .",
    "this field star overdensity could be a signature of halo substructure in the field .",
    "chvc 017 - 25 - 218 is close to the extended stellar stream of the tidally disrupted sagittarius dsph galaxy ( majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) and the distance modulus of the sagittarius stream near this location ( @xmath74 ) would put sgr rgb stars close to the apparent magnitude of the bright clump in chvc 017 - 25 - 218 and its control field .",
    "it is highly probably that the excess of bright giants in chvc 017 - 25 - 218 and its control field are giants from the sagittarius debris stream , although spectroscopy will be needed to confirm this interpretation .",
    "if these stars are sagittarius debris , it validates the basic strategy of our survey since in this case we _ would _ have successfully identified a diffuse , but distinct stellar population in our fields .",
    "it should be noted that even if the stars are sagittarius debris , this says nothing about the chvc itself .",
    "the radial velocity of chvc 017 - 25 - 218 is a few hundred km s@xmath6 discrepant from the sgr radial velocity near this field .    in  4",
    ", we showed that the brighter giants in chvc 271 + 29 + 181 and its control field are galactic field stars .",
    "however , the bulk of the giant candidates are fainter than the limit of our spectroscopy ( and fainter than the excess in chvc 017 - 25 - 218 and its control field ) .",
    "it is possible that spectroscopy of the fainter giants  particularly the ( @xmath47 ) group in the control field  might reveal another moving group of giant stars even further into the halo .",
    "our multifilter examination of four hvcs has failed to detect evidence for a stellar population in four hvcs , which , by virtue of our search strategy for diffuse populations of giant stars , places the strongest limits so far on the existence of stellar populations in the cores of hvcs .",
    "although a number of stars in our survey fields can be classified as distant giants based on their location in two - color space , there is no excess of giant candidates in any hvc compared with its control field .",
    "in addition , the total number of giant candidates in our fields roughly corresponds to the predicted contribution from galactic field stars .",
    "echelle spectroscopy of the brightest giants in one hvc and its control field confirm that they are indeed likely to represent stars from canonical galactic populations .",
    "the two compact hvcs show a significant excess of giant candidates beyond the predicted contamination level .",
    "however , it is likely that these excesses are unrelated to the chvcs and are , in fact , distant overdensities ( perhaps streams ) of halo giants unrelated to the hvcs themselves , particularly in chvc 017 - 25 - 218 , which nearly overlaps the sagittarius debris stream .",
    "only further spectroscopy of the giant candidates should definitively resolve these issues .",

    "<S> we report the results of a photometric search for giant stars associated with the cores of four high velocity clouds ( hvcs )  two of which are compact hvcs  using the las campanas du pont 2.5 meter and cerro tololo blanco 4 meter telescopes in combination with a system of filters ( washington @xmath0 , @xmath1 + @xmath2 ) useful for identifying low surface gravity , evolved stars . </S>",
    "<S> identical observations of nearby control fields provide a measure of the `` giant star '' background . </S>",
    "<S> our data reach @xmath3 for three of the hvcs and @xmath4 for the fourth , depths that allow the detection of any giant stars within 600 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> although we identify a number of faint late - type giant star candidates , we find neither a coherent red giant branch structure nor a clear excess of giant candidate counts in any hvc . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the giant candidates are probably not related to the hvcs and are more likely to be either random milky way giant stars or one of several classes of potential survey contaminants . </S>",
    "<S> echelle spectroscopy of the brightest giant candidates in one hvc and its control field reveal radial velocities representative of the canonical galactic stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these null results , no evidence of any young hvc stellar populations  represented by blue main sequence stars  is found , a result consistent with previous searches . </S>",
    "<S> our methodology , specifically designed to find faint diffuse stellar populations , places the tightest upper limit yet on the _ total _ stellar mass of hvcs of a few @xmath5 . </S>"
