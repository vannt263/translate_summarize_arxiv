    "during the last decades of the twentieth century it was realized that information processing at the quantum level could offer tremendous advantages over conventional `` classical '' information processing .",
    "quantum information admits extremely efficient algorithms , such as shor s factoring algorithm  @xcite , and qualitatively superior cryptographic protocols , such as the bb84 key distribution protocol  @xcite .",
    "many other works contributed to put this field on solid foundations .",
    "quantum error - correcting codes and fault - tolerant quantum computation showed that these beautiful ideas could in principle be realized experimentally . these codes , combined with holevo s theorem , schumacher compression , and entanglement distillation ( which are analogs of shannon s noiseless coding theorem ) gave us the foundations of an information theory pertaining to quantum systems in terms of quantum bits , or _",
    "qubits _ , and entanglement that is measured ( in the bipartite case ) in entanglement bits , or _",
    "ebits_. these discoveries generated huge excitement .",
    "by now quantum information has become a well - established field , and there are many reviews and textbooks to which we refer the reader for background information .",
    "see for example  .",
    "in view of the advantages that quantum information offers for computation and cryptography , it is natural to enquire whether quantum information is also a superior medium for efficient communication . in this article",
    "we will review progress on this specific question , and its relation to the problem of quantum non - locality which has fascinated physicists for decades .    on the face of it , there are important reasons for doubting that quantum information provides such a communication efficiency advantage .",
    "many years before the `` quantum information '' discipline took hold on a large scale , holevo  @xcite proved an important theorem about the classical information capacity of quantum channels .",
    "holevo s theorem  as it is now called ",
    "states that , for any classical message , the cost of transmitting it from one party ( alice ) to another party ( bob ) in terms of quantum bits ( _ _ qu__bits ) is the same as the cost of transmitting it in terms of classical bits .",
    "if the task requires @xmath0 bits on average , then it also requires @xmath0 qubits on average .",
    "the latter consequence of holevo s theorem can be proven quite simply using a different approach  @xcite , and this proof is reproduced in appendix  [ nayakbound ] .",
    "thus one would naively expect that quantum information can not provide a communication efficiency advantage .",
    "this intuition turns out to be wrong .",
    "tremendous communication savings are possible with the use of quantum information , as explained in the next section .      to understand why quantum information can provide a communication advantage without contradicting holevo s theorem ,",
    "it is necessary to consider more precisely the various scenarios that can be associated with `` communication '' .    the simplest scenario , corresponding to the case covered by holevo s theorem , is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : comm ] .",

    "alice has an @xmath4-bit string @xmath3 that she would like to convey to bob by sending one message .",
    "here it is indeed true , by holevo s theorem  @xcite , that quantum messages are no more efficient than classical messages .",
    "alice must send @xmath4 qubits to accomplish this specific task .",
    "a variant of the communication scenario is where bob s goal is not to determine alice s data  @xmath3 , but to determine some information that is a _ function _ of @xmath3 in a way that may depend on other data  @xmath5 that resides with bob ( while @xmath5 is unknown to alice ) .",
    "such a scenario could occur when alice and bob each begin with @xmath4-bit strings , @xmath3 and @xmath5 , respectively ( alice knows @xmath3 but not @xmath5 and bob knows @xmath5 but not @xmath3 ) , and the goal is for bob to determine the value of some function @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is known to both parties ) .",
    "an example where such a scenario could arise is where alice and bob are interested in scheduling an appointment .",
    "alice s schedule could be represented by  @xmath3 and bob s by  @xmath5 : if there are @xmath4 time - slots , then we can set the @xmath8th bit of @xmath3 to 1 if alice is available in time - slot  @xmath8 , and similarly for  @xmath5 .",
    "how much communication is required for bob to find a time when they are both available ( i.e. , an @xmath8 such that @xmath9 ) ?",
    "we shall see that , for _ this _ communication scenario , quantum information enables alice and bob to accomplish the task with less ( asymptotically less in the number of time - slots ) qubit communication than would be required by any protocol that is restricted to classical bit communication .",
    "this kind of scenario , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc ] ( for general functions or relations @xmath7 on @xmath10 ) is known as _ communication complexity_.

    "these savings in classical communication are very interesting both from a practical and a conceptual point of view .",
    "section  [ sec : cc ] outlines several of the key results in the area , and we refer the reader to the textbooks   for further information .",
    "when alice and bob can communicate qubits , further reductions in the amount of communication are possible , sometimes even exponential reductions .",
    "this remarkable situation is clearly worthy of further study .",
    "it is one of the main subjects covered by the present review , and we will see many examples later .",
    "long before the work on quantum communication complexity mentioned in the previous section , physicists investigating the foundations of quantum mechanics studied the scenario where local measurements are carried out on two entangled particles .",
    "such entangled states can ( at least in principle ) be easily produced by having the particles interact together for some time , and then sending the particles away to far - off locations .",
    "local measurements are then carried out on the particles .",
    "this scenario was first studied by einstein , podolsky , and rosen  @xcite and immediately afterwards by schrdinger  @xcite ( who coined the word _ entanglement _ ) . in these works",
    "it was realized that the results of the local measurements would exhibit very interesting correlations . for instance",
    ", for some pairs of the measurements , the results may be always the same ; for other pairs of measurements , the results may be always opposite , etc .",
    "nevertheless , one can easily show  this follows immediately from the structure of quantum mechanics  that the parties carrying out the measurements can not use the entangled particles to communicate to each other .",
    "more precisely , if two physically separated parties , alice and bob , initially possess entangled particles and then alice is given an arbitrary bit @xmath3 , there is no way for alice to manipulate her particles in order to convey any information about @xmath3 to bob when he performs measurements on his particles .    given that these correlations can not be used for communication , one would naively expect that if a ( quantum or classical ) model can reproduce these correlations , then it is not necessary for that model to use communication .",
    "this is indeed the case in the quantum scenario where , having established the entanglement through some interaction in the past , no communication is needed at the time of the measurement .",
    "but if one wants to reproduce these correlations in a purely classical model , then classical communication between the parties is required at the moment of the measurements !",
    "this situation is even more surprising if the particles are widely separated from each other and the measurements take place during a very short time interval , so short that the two measurement events are space - like separated . in this case",
    "the communication would have to occur faster than the speed of light !",
    "this remarkable feature of quantum mechanics was discovered by bell  @xcite , and is now known as `` quantum non - locality '' .",
    "it has been the subject of much further theoretical and experimental study since .",
    "indeed it is one of the most surprising and counter - intuitive features of quantum mechanics .",
    "bell s theorem shows that einstein s program of trying to rationalize quantum mechanics by reducing it to classical mechanics is futile and doomed to failure , as it can not be done without giving up another cornerstone of twentieth century physics ( discovered by einstein himself ) , namely the fact that information can not travel faster than the speed of light .",
    "more recently , another reason why such a reduction is doomed emerged through the study of quantum information . namely we expect any such classical description of quantum mechanics to be exponentially inefficient , i.e. , to use _ exponentially _ more resources than the quantum theory",
    ". we will discuss quantum non - locality extensively in the present review , focusing on its connection to communication complexity .",
    "the reason why in this review we deal with quantum communication complexity and quantum non - locality together is that these two topics are intimately related .",
    "indeed they can be formulated in a unified way , and furthermore many questions can be mapped from one topic to the other .",
    "in fact , during the past dozen years an intense cross - fertilization has occurred between these two fields , which has considerably enriched both of them .    to see the unity between the two subjects ,",
    "recall that in both cases the parties , alice and bob , are given some inputs , @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "in one case these inputs correspond to the arguments of the function that must be computed . in the other case",
    "these inputs correspond to a description of the measurements that must be carried out on the particles ( the `` measurement settings '' ) . and in both cases alice and bob must provide an output , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in communication complexity we require that @xmath14 and @xmath12 is irrelevant ; in non - locality we are interested in the correlations between @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath3 , @xmath5 ( for instance we request that @xmath15 when @xmath3 and @xmath5 have certain values and that @xmath16 when @xmath3 and @xmath5 have some other values ) .",
    "we can unify these descriptions by saying that the aim in both cases is to produce a joint probability distribution @xmath17 of the outputs given the inputs , such that @xmath18 has certain desirable properties .      in both communication and non - locality , the basic question one wants to answer is : what is the minimum amount of resources necessary to reproduce the distribution @xmath18 , and how does this amount change when one changes the model , i.e. , when one changes the type of resource that can be used .",
    "there are in fact many different types of resources that can be compared , and we now briefly review them . we will come back to them in more detail in the body of the review .    *",
    "_ quantum communication . _",
    "the parties are allowed to send each other quantum states .",
    "one quantifies the amount of communication by the number of _ qubits _ sent . *",
    "_ classical communication . _",
    "the parties are allowed to send each other classical communication .",
    "one quantifies the amount of communication by the number of _ bits _ sent . *",
    "_ entanglement .",
    "_ the parties share entangled states .",
    "one quantifies the amount of entanglement by the number of qubits that the state locally consists of .",
    "for example we frequently use maximally entangled states of 2 qubits , called _ ebits _ ( also known as epr pairs after  @xcite ) , @xmath19 or something that can be obtained from this with local operations . * _ shared randomness . _ the parties have randomness , i.e. , they are allowed to toss coins . in the case of _ shared _ randomness , the parties both share the same string of coins .",
    "this could for instance be implemented by having the parties toss the coins beforehand , at some earlier time when they are together , and then use the coins later when they need to solve the communication complexity problem .",
    "* _ local randomness .",
    "_ the parties have randomness , i.e. , they are allowed to toss coins . in the case of _",
    "local _ randomness the coins are tossed locally , and the string of outcomes of the coins for alice is independent of the string of outcomes of the coins for bob .",
    "the rational for measuring classical information in terms of bits is shannon s noiseless coding theorem  @xcite , which states that , asymptotically , the information produced by a stochastic source can be encoded in a number of bits equal to the entropy of the source .",
    "this is paralleled in the quantum case by schumacher compression  @xcite , which states that , asymptotically , the information produced by a stochastic quantum source can be encoded into a number of qubits equal to the von neumann entropy of the source . and it is paralleled in the case of entanglement , by entanglement distillations , namely the fact that pure two - party entangled states can , asymptotically in the number of copies of the state , be converted into the number of ebits equal to the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix of each party  @xcite . in the context of communication complexity , however , we are not dealing with the asymptotic limit of large amounts of communication or large amounts of entanglement .",
    "thus whereas in most cases we will keep the basic concepts of bits , qubits and ebits , it could be relevant in specific cases to consider variants on these resources , such as trits , non - maximally entangled states , etc .",
    "the above resources have been ordered ( more or less ) from the strongest to the weakest .",
    "indeed most of these resources imply the ones below them .",
    "for instance one can send classical information using qubits ; one can use quantum communication to distribute entanglement ; one can measure the entangled particles to produce shared randomness , etc .",
    "the only case where the ordering is not so clear is between classical communication and entanglement .",
    "indeed if two parties share an entangled state , they can not use it to communicate ( as discussed above ) .",
    "but on the other hand ( as discussed below ) sharing @xmath4 ebits may allow one to save an exponentially large ( in @xmath4 ) amount of bits in some communication scenarios ( whereas in all other cases , @xmath4 uses of one resource allows one to implement @xmath4 uses of the resources below it ) .",
    "there are also a number of nontrivial ways in which these resources can be substituted one for the other . _",
    "quantum teleportation _ allows one to substitute one ebit and two bits of classical communication for one qubit of quantum communication  @xcite . _",
    "dense coding _ shows that sharing one ebit and then communicating one qubit allows one to communicate two bits  @xcite .",
    "_ newman s theorem _ states that in the context of communication complexity , having shared randomness can save only a small amount of communication compared to having local randomness  @xcite .",
    "in addition we will at some points in this review consider other additional ( more specialized or more exotic ) resources .",
    "for instance one can consider    * _ one - way classical or quantum communication .",
    "_ alice is allowed to communicate to bob , but bob is not allowed to communicate back to alice . *",
    "_ simultaneous message passing model .",
    "_ in this model there is a third party , called the referee , and messages are only allowed from alice to the referee and from bob to the referee .",
    "it is the referee who has to compute the value of the function @xmath6 . *",
    "_ multipartite entanglement .",
    "_ sometimes one is interested in non - locality or communication complexity between more than two parties .",
    "contrary to bipartite entanglement where it is sufficient to consider ebits , there are many kinds of multiparticle entanglement ( such as ghz states , w states , etc . ) which could be useful for solving different communication problems . *",
    "_ non - local ( or pr ) boxes .",
    "_ this exotic resource is intermediate between an ebit and a bit .",
    "indeed , it is a resource which does not enable the parties to communicate ( in the same way that entanglement does not allow communication ) . but to be produced physically it requires a bit of communication between the parties at the moment it is used ( contrary to entanglement which once established requires no more communication ) .",
    "its study provides a deeper understanding of the power and limitations of quantum entanglement in communication complexity .",
    "the basic question asked in communication complexity and quantum non - locality is to understand how much of these resources are required in different situations .",
    "thus classical communication complexity   is basically concerned with understanding how much classical communication is required to compute the value of a function @xmath6 , possibly using ( shared or local ) randomness .    in quantum communication complexity",
    "the parties are trying to compute the value of @xmath7 , but may now use quantum resources . in the _ quantum communication model _ , introduced by yao  @xcite , they can communicate qubits , and in the _ entanglement _ model , introduced by cleve and buhrman  , the parties share entangled particles and are allowed to communicate classical bits .",
    "when one extends the quantum communication model of yao such that the parties also share entangled particles , quantum teleportation shows that these two models are essentially equivalent : one qubit in the first model can be replaced by two bits and one ebit in the entanglement , and conversely one bit can be simulated by one qubit .",
    "it is , however , a challenging open problem whether the quantum communication model , _ without _ shared entanglement , is essentially equivalent to the entanglement model .    _ non - locality _ , although at first sight a very different topic , is also concerned with comparing resources . indeed the basic question in this area is to compare :    * the correlations that can be obtained if the parties share entanglement and carry out local measurements on their particles , but are not allowed any communication . * the correlations that can be obtained if the parties have shared randomness , but are not allowed any communication .",
    "this is known in the physics literature as a _ local hidden variable model_.    bell s theorem states that these two scenarios are not equivalent : shared randomness alone is not sufficient to reproduce the quantum correlations .",
    "thus quantum communication complexity , classical communication complexity , and non - locality can be put in a unified framework in which similar kinds of resources are compared .",
    "in addition , in some cases there exist mappings between quantum communication complexity scenarios and non - locality scenarios .",
    "the most simple such mapping occurs in the entanglement model if the parties can solve the communication complexity problem more efficiently using entanglement than without entanglement , and if this can be done by measuring their entangled particles _ before _ they communicate to each other .",
    "then it immediately follows that the correlations obtained by measuring their entangled particles ( but without communicating ) , can not be realized in a local hidden variable model .",
    "conversely it is possible to map any non - locality experiment to a communication complexity problem in the entanglement model .",
    "this was the approach used in the original paper  .",
    "it mapped the non - local correlations that arise in the ghz paradox to a communication complexity problem .",
    "this approach has since been generalized  @xcite , although in the resulting communication complexity problem the function @xmath6 is only computed successfully by the parties with non - zero probability .",
    "another mapping can occur in the quantum communication model when _ one - way _ quantum communication from alice to bob is more efficient than classical communication .",
    "then it is often possible to construct from the communication complexity problem a nontrivial non - locality scenario .",
    "this approach has yielded some very interesting non - locality scenarios which we will describe in detail below .      in this review",
    "we will present some of the main results obtained so far in the field of quantum communication complexity .",
    "we start by introducing quantum non - locality in section  [ sec : nl ] , focusing on its relation with communication complexity .",
    "we present simple examples such as the ghz paradox , the chsh example , the magic square game , but rephrasing them in the language of data processing .",
    "next we present quantum communication complexity in section  [ sec : cc ] , illustrating it with examples such as the distributed deutsch - jozsa problem , the intersection problem , raz s problem , and the hidden matching problem . in section  [ sec : nlandcc ]",
    "we unite these two approaches , showing how some of the examples from quantum communication complexity can be used to derive new non - locality games . in section  [ sec : smp ] we discuss another model of communication complexity , the simultaneous message passing model , and show how classical communication , entanglement , quantum communication can be traded one for the other in this model . in section  [ sec : otherqnl ] we discuss several additional aspects of quantum non - locality , such as non - local boxes , tsirelson bounds , and simulation of quantum correlations using classical resources .",
    "finally we consider in section  [ sec : impl ] experimental issues , in particular the detection loophole , and present the outlook for future experiments .",
    "we conclude by discussing some open questions in the field .",
    "the interested reader can also consult the earlier review  @xcite which covers some of the material presented here .",
    "the idea of non - locality was originally concerned with the possibility that quantum mechanics is actually a _ classical theory _ that depends on `` hidden variables '' whose values might be discovered in the future as part of some successor theory to quantum mechanics .",
    "bell  @xcite proposed a hypothetical experiment for ruling out such classical theories under the assumption that measurements of quantum systems can occur at different points in space - time , and information can not be transmitted faster than the speed of light .",
    "another way of interpreting bell s experiment is as a method for two ( or more ) cooperating distributed parties to compute some sort of input - output relation , where each party receives input data and must produce output data consistent with the relation . in bell",
    "s experiment , there is such a task that can not be accomplished in a setting where the information processing resources are all classical .",
    "in contrast , the task _ can _ be accomplished if the parties share prior entanglement .    since bell s seminal work , the concept of quantum non - locality has been extensively studied , by physicists , philosophers , and more recently by computer scientists .",
    "some of the important early advances have been the clauser - horn - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite which allows bell s surprising predictions to be tested even in the presence of noise ; and the ghz - mermin scenario  @xcite which was the first `` pseudo - telepathy '' game .",
    "more recently there has been a more or less systematic enumeration of bell inequalities for small number of settings and/or outcomes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; the study of the statistical power of non - locality tests  @xcite ; an understanding of the limits to quantum non - locality ( tsirelson - type bounds )  @xcite as compared to the larger world of correlations obeying only the no - signalling conditions ( e.g. , non - local boxes ) ; investigations of the power of non - locality in cryptographic settings  @xcite , etc .    in the next paragraphs we review various non - locality scenarios ,",
    "casting them in the language of data processing .",
    "the reader wishing to complement this overview could consult two recent reviews , written more from physics  @xcite and computer science  @xcite perspectives .",
    "the following scenario essentially underlies those of  @xcite , but is cast in the language of data processing .",

    "to analyze the situation in terms of classical information , first again consider the case of deterministic strategies .",
    "for these , alice s output bit depends solely on her input bit @xmath20 and similarly for bob .",
    "let @xmath64 be the two possibilities for alice and @xmath33 be the two possibilities for bob .",
    "these four bits completely characterize any deterministic strategy .",
    "condition  ( [ eq : chsh ] ) translates into the equations @xmath65 it is impossible to satisfy all four equations simultaneously ( since summing them modulo 2 yields @xmath37 ) .",
    "therefore it is impossible to satisfy condition  ( [ eq : chsh ] ) absolutely . by using a probabilistic strategy , alice and bob",
    "can satisfy condition  ( [ eq : chsh ] ) with probability @xmath42 .",
    "for such a strategy , we allow alice and bob to have _ a priori _ classical random variables , whose distribution is independent of that of the inputs @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that _ any _ three of the four equations of  ( [ eq : eqchsh ] ) can be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "the probabilistic classical strategy works as follows .",
    "alice and bob have uniformly - distributed random bits that are used to specify which of the four equations of  ( [ eq : eqchsh ] ) is violated , and then play the strategy that satisfies the other three perfectly .",
    "it is easy to see that ( a ) for any input @xmath66 , the resulting outputs satisfy condition  ( [ eq : chsh ] ) with probability @xmath42 , and ( b ) this is optimal in that no probabilistic strategy can attain a success probability greater than @xmath42 .",
    "now consider the same problem but where alice and bob are each supplied with a qubit where the state of the two - qubit system is initialized to @xmath67 it turns out that now the parties can produce data that satisfies condition  ( [ eq : chsh ] ) with probability @xmath68 , which is higher than what is possible in the classical case .",
    "this is achieved by the following procedures .",
    "denote the unitary operation that rotates the qubit by angle @xmath69 by @xmath70 ( where we have written it out in the computational basis ) .",
    "alice applies one of two rotations on her qubit , depending on her input bit @xmath20 : if @xmath71 the rotation is @xmath72 ; if @xmath73 the rotation is @xmath74 .",
    "then alice measures her qubit in the computational basis and sets her output bit @xmath12 to the result .",
    "bob s procedure is the same , depending on his input bit @xmath21 .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate that , if alice rotates by @xmath75 and bob rotates by @xmath76 , then the entangled state becomes @xmath77 after the measurements , the probability that @xmath78 is @xmath79 .",
    "it is now a straightforward exercise to verify that condition  [ eq : chsh ] is satisfied with probability @xmath80 for all four input possibilities .",
    "although the protocol in the previous subsection using entanglement has a higher success probability ( @xmath68 ) than any classical protocol ( @xmath42 ) , it still does not succeed with probability  1 .",
    "this raises the question of whether there is a different strategy using entanglement that always succeeds  or , failing that , whose success probability exceeds @xmath80 .",
    "tsirelson  @xcite first showed that the above quantum protocol is optimal in that it is impossible to exceed success probability @xmath80 , regardless of the strategy  including any amount of prior entanglement ",
    "the parties start with .",
    "what follows is a simple proof of this result .",
    "consider an arbitrary bipartite entangled state @xmath81 .",
    "an arbitrary strategy for alice that uses this entangled state can be represented by two observables @xmath82 and @xmath83 , each with eigenvalues in @xmath84 . when alice s input bit is @xmath31 , she obtains her output bit by applying the projective measurement corresponding to the eigenspaces of @xmath82 to the component of @xmath81 in her possession .",
    "the @xmath85-eigenspace of @xmath82 corresponds to output bit @xmath31 , while the @xmath86-eigenspace corresponds to the output bit @xmath32 .",
    "when her input bit is @xmath32 , she applies the measurement corresponding to @xmath83 .",
    "similarly , an arbitrary strategy for bob can be represented by two observables @xmath87 and @xmath88 .    at this point , the reader might object that @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 do not capture every possible strategy of alice and bob , since they need not be limited to applying projective measurements .",
    "although non - projective measurements may be used , such measurements can always be simulated by projective measurements in a larger hilbert space .",
    "thus , no generality has been lost because any strategy can be converted to the above form .",
    "since the observables have eigenvalues in @xmath84 rather than @xmath89 , it is more convenient here to think of alice and bob s output bits in these terms as @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "then the protocol succeeds on input @xmath66 if and only if @xmath92 .",
    "if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are randomly chosen according the uniform distribution , then the expected value of @xmath93 is @xmath94 and is therefore upper bounded by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath95 it is straightforward to calculate that @xmath96 from which we can upper bound the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath97 by the sum of the maximum eigenvalue in each term , obtaining @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath99 itself is at most @xmath100 , which therefore upper bounds the expected value of @xmath93 .",
    "this translates into an upper bound of @xmath101 for the success probability of the actual protocol ( where alice and bob output bits @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "this completes the proof of tsirelson s upper bound for chsh .      in one respect",
    "the ghz example is more striking than the chsh example : in the former case , the protocol with entanglement _ always _ succeeds , while in the latter case the protocol with entanglement merely succeeds with higher probability .",
    "however , the ghz example involves three parties , whereas the chsh example only involves two .",
    "is there a _ two - party _ scenario where the quantum protocol always succeeds , whereas the best classical success probability is bounded below  @xmath32 ?",
    "the answer is affirmative , see for instance @xcite .",
    "a particularly elegant example is the following game , which has been referred to as the _ magic square game _  @xcite .    to define this game , consider the problem of labeling the entries of a @xmath102 matrix with bits so that the parity of each row is even , whereas the parity of each column is odd .",
    "it is not hard to see that this is impossible , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 . adding these equations modulo 2 yields @xmath37 . ] .",
    "the two matrices    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for our present purposes , the noteworthy property is that the observables along each row commute and their product is @xmath108 , and the observables along each column commute and their product is @xmath109 .",
    "this implies that , for any two - qubit state , performing the three measurements along any row results in three @xmath84-valued bits whose product is @xmath85 .",
    "also , performing the three measurements along any column results in three @xmath84-valued bits whose product is @xmath86 .",
    "this can be seen more easily when one simultaneously diagonalizes the three commuting observables .",
    "they will have @xmath32 and @xmath86 eigenvalues on the diagonal .",
    "each consecutive observable will project the state onto a possible refinement of the current eigenspace the state lies in .",
    "this will yield that the product of the outcomes of the three observables will be @xmath32 in case the observables belong to a row of the matrix , because the product of the row observables is @xmath108 , and @xmath86 when they belong to a column , since the product of the observables for each column is @xmath109 .",
    "we can now describe the quantum protocol .",
    "it uses two pairs of entangled qubits , each of which is in initial state @xmath110 .",
    "alice , on input @xmath20 , applies three two - qubit measurements corresponding to the observables in row @xmath20 of the above table . for each measurement , if the result is @xmath85 , she outputs @xmath31 and if the result is @xmath86 , she outputs @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , bob , on input @xmath21 , applies the measurements corresponding to the observables in column @xmath21 , and converts the outcomes into bits in the same manner .",
    "we have already established that alice and bob s output bits satisfy the required parity constraints .",
    "it remains to show that alice and bob s output bits that correspond to where the row meets the column are the same .",
    "for that measurement , alice and bob are measuring with respect to the same observable in the above table . because all the observables in each row and in each column commute , we may assume that the place where they intersect is the first observable applied .",
    "those bits are obtained by alice and bob each measuring @xmath111 with respect to the observable in entry @xmath112 of the table . to show that their measurements will agree for all cases of @xmath66 , we consider the individual pauli measurements on the individual entangled pairs of the form @xmath110",
    ". let @xmath113 and @xmath114 denote the outcomes of the first measurement ( in terms of bits ) , and @xmath115 and @xmath116 denote the outcomes of the second . since the measurement associated with the tensor product of two observables is operationally equivalent to measuring each individual observable and taking the product of the results , we have that @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that if the same measurement from @xmath119 is applied to each qubit of @xmath110 then the outcomes will be distinct .",
    "therefore , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , from which it follows that @xmath122 so @xmath123 .",
    "this completes the analysis of the magic square game .",
    "in the last section we considered scenarios without communication . here we will extend the non - locality setting to one where the parties ( alice and bob ) are allowed to send information to each other in the form of bits or qubits . they can still have shared randomness and may share an entangled quantum state .",
    "we are now interested in the _ minimum number _ of bits or qubits that are needed in order to compute a function that depends on the inputs of all the parties .",
    "the ability to send information to each other departs from the setting of non - locality .",
    "we will see that entanglement can be used to reduce ( for certain functions ) the communication drastically compared to when the parties share just classical resources .",
    "accordingly , while entanglement can not be used for signalling , it can be used to significantly reduce the communication needed for certain tasks . in later sections",
    "we will see how some of the ideas and protocols developed in the setting of communication complexity can be used to formulate new non - locality games .",
    "communication complexity has been studied extensively in the area of theoretical computer science and has deep connections with seemingly unrelated areas , such as vlsi design , circuit lower bounds , lower bounds on branching programs , size of data structures , and bounds on the length of logical proof systems , to name just a few .",
    "we refer to the textbooks   for more details .",
    "first we sketch the setting for classical communication complexity .",
    "alice and bob want to compute some function @xmath124 , where @xmath125 .",
    "if the domain @xmath126 equals @xmath127 then @xmath7 is called a _ total _ function , otherwise it is a _ promise _ function .",
    "alice receives input @xmath128 , bob receives input @xmath129 , with @xmath130 .",
    "a typical situation , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc ] , is where @xmath131 , so both alice and bob receive an @xmath4-bit input string . as the value @xmath6 will generally depend on both @xmath3 and @xmath5 , some communication between alice and bob is required in order for them to be able to compute @xmath6 .",
    "we are interested in the _ minimal _ amount of communication they need .    a communication _",
    "protocol _ is a distributed algorithm where first alice does some individual computation , and then sends a message ( of one or more bits ) to bob , then bob does some computation and sends a message to alice , etc .",
    "each message is called a _",
    "round_. after one or more rounds the protocol terminates and outputs some value , which must be known to both players .",
    "the _ cost _ of a protocol is the total number of bits communicated on the worst - case input .",
    "a _ deterministic _",
    "protocol for @xmath7 always has to output the right value @xmath6 for all @xmath130 . in a _ bounded - error _ protocol",
    ", alice and bob may flip coins and the protocol has to output the right value @xmath6 with probability @xmath132 for all @xmath130 .",
    "we could either allow alice and bob to toss coins individually ( local randomness , or `` private coin '' ) or jointly ( shared randomness , or `` public coin '' ) .",
    "the later is analogous to the local hidden variables in non - locality games .",
    "a public coin can simulate a private coin and is potentially more powerful .",
    "however , newman s theorem  @xcite says that having a public coin can save at most @xmath133 bits of communication , compared to a protocol with a private coin .",
    "some often studied functions are :    * _ equality : _",
    "@xmath134 if @xmath135 , and @xmath136 otherwise * _ inner product :",
    "_ @xmath137 ( for @xmath138 , @xmath139 is the @xmath8th bit of @xmath3 ) * _ intersection : _",
    "@xmath140 if there is an @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath141 otherwise ( viewing @xmath3 as corresponding to the set @xmath142 and similarly for @xmath5 , @xmath143 says whether the sets @xmath3 and @xmath5 intersect ) .",
    "a variant of this problem asks to actually find an @xmath8 where @xmath9 , or to output that none such @xmath8 exists .",
    "let us first consider the equality problem , which will recur throughout the text .",
    "the goal for alice is to determine whether her @xmath4-bit input is the same as bob s or not .",
    "it is not hard to show that in the deterministic case , @xmath4 bits of communication are needed ( see section  [ ssecrectangles ] of the appendix for a proof ) , so bob might as well send his string to alice after which alice announces the answer to bob with one more bit .    to illustrate the power of randomness ,",
    "let us give a simple yet efficient bounded - error protocol for the equality problem .",
    "alice and bob jointly toss a random string @xmath144 .",
    "alice sends the bit @xmath145 to bob ( where ` @xmath146 ' is inner product mod 2 ) . bob computes @xmath147 and compares this with @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath135 then @xmath15 , but if @xmath148 then @xmath16 with probability 1/2 .",
    "repeating this a few times , alice and bob can decide equality with small error using @xmath149 public coin flips and a constant amount of communication .",
    "this protocol uses public coins , but note that newman s theorem implies that there exists an @xmath133-bit protocol that uses a private coin .",
    "let us explicitly describe such a protocol .",
    "alice views her @xmath4 bits as the coefficients of a polynomial @xmath150 over some finite field @xmath151 of about @xmath152 elements : and do all additions and multiplications modulo this @xmath153 . ]",
    "she picks a random element @xmath155 , and sends bob the pair @xmath156 , which she can do using @xmath157 bits .",
    "bob computes @xmath158 and outputs 1 if @xmath159 , and outputs 0 otherwise . clearly , if @xmath135 then bob always outputs the correct answer 1",
    ". however , if @xmath148 then the polynomial @xmath160 is a polynomial in @xmath21 of degree at most @xmath161 that is not identically equal to 0 .",
    "such a polynomial can be 0 on at most @xmath161 elements of @xmath151 . hence with probability at least @xmath162 , the field element @xmath12 that alice chose satisfies @xmath163 , and bob will give the correct output 0 also in this case .",
    "now what happens if we give alice and bob a quantum computer and allow them to send each other qubits and/or to make use of ebits that they share at the start of the protocol ?    formally speaking , we can model a quantum protocol as follows .",
    "the total state consists of 3 parts : alice s private space , the channel , and bob s private space .",
    "the starting state is @xmath164 : alice gets @xmath3 , the channel is initialized to 0 , and bob gets @xmath5 .",
    "now alice applies a unitary transformation to her space and the channel .",
    "this corresponds to her private computation as well as to putting a message on the channel ( the length of this message is the number of channel - qubits affected by alice s operation ) .",
    "then bob applies a unitary transformation to his space and the channel , etc . at the end of the protocol alice or bob makes a measurement to determine the output of the protocol .",
    "this model was introduced by yao  @xcite .    in the second model , introduced by cleve and buhrman  , alice and bob share an unlimited number of ebits at the start of the protocol ,",
    "but now they communicate via a _ classical _ channel : the channel has to be in a classical state throughout the protocol .",
    "we only count the communication , not the number of ebits used .",
    "protocols of this kind can simulate protocols of the first kind with only a factor 2 overhead : using teleportation , the parties can send each other a qubit using an ebit and two classical bits of communication . hence the qubit - protocols that we describe below also immediately yield protocols that work with entanglement and a classical channel .",
    "note that an ebit can simulate a public coin toss : if alice and bob each measure their half of the pair of qubits , they get the same random bit .",
    "the third variant combines the strengths of the other two : here alice and bob start out with an unlimited number of ebits _ and _ they are allowed to communicate qubits .",
    "this third kind of communication complexity is in fact equivalent to the second , up to a factor of 2 , again by teleportation .    before continuing to study this model",
    ", we first have to face an important question , already mentioned in the introduction : _ is there anything to be gained here ? _ at first sight , the following argument seems to rule out any significant gain .",
    "suppose that in the classical world @xmath0 bits have to be communicated in order to compute @xmath7 .",
    "since holevo s theorem says that @xmath0 qubits can not contain more information than @xmath0 classical bits , it seems that the quantum communication complexity should be roughly @xmath0 qubits as well ( maybe @xmath165 to account for superdense coding , but not less ) .",
    "surprisingly ( and fortunately for us ) , this argument is false , and quantum communication can sometimes be much less than classical communication complexity .",
    "the information - theoretic argument via holevo s theorem fails , because alice and bob do not need to communicate the information in the @xmath0 bits of the classical protocol ; they are only interested in the value @xmath6 , which is just 1 bit . below we will survey some of the main examples that have so far been found of differences between quantum and classical communication complexity .",
    "quantum communication complexity was introduced by yao  @xcite and studied by kremer  @xcite , but neither showed any advantages of quantum over classical communication .",
    "cleve and buhrman   introduced the variant with classical communication and prior entanglement , and exhibited the first quantum protocol provably better than any classical protocol .",
    "it uses quantum entanglement to save 1 bit of classical communication .",
    "this gap was extended by buhrman , cleve , and van dam  @xcite and , for arbitrary @xmath0 parties , by buhrman , van dam , hyer , and tapp  @xcite .",
    "the first impressively large gaps between quantum and classical communication complexity were exhibited by buhrman , cleve , and wigderson  @xcite .",
    "their protocols are distributed versions of known quantum query algorithms , like the deutsch - jozsa   and grover  @xcite algorithms .",
    "let us start with the first one .",
    "it is actually explained most easily in a direct way , without reference to the deutsch - jozsa algorithm ( though that is where the idea came from ) .",
    "the problem deals with a promise version of the equality problem .",
    "suppose the @xmath4-bit inputs @xmath3 and @xmath5 are restricted to the following case :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * dj promise : * either @xmath135 , or @xmath3 and @xmath5 differ in exactly @xmath166 positions _",

    "in fact it will be convenient to assume @xmath4 a power of 2 .",
    "here is a simple quantum protocol to solve this promise version of equality using only @xmath167 qubits :    1 .",
    "alice sends bob the @xmath167-qubit state @xmath168 , which she can prepare unitarily from @xmath3 and @xmath167 @xmath51-qubits .",
    "bob applies the unitary map @xmath169 to the state , applies a hadamard transform to each qubit ( for this it is convenient to view @xmath8 as a @xmath167-bit string ) , and measures the resulting @xmath167-qubit state .",
    "bob outputs 1 if the measurement gave @xmath170 and outputs 0 otherwise .",
    "it is clear that this protocol only communicates @xmath167 qubits , but why does it work ? note that the state that bob measures is @xmath171 this superposition looks rather unwieldy , but consider the amplitude of the @xmath170 basis state .",
    "it is @xmath172 , which is 1 if @xmath135 and @xmath31 otherwise because the promise now guarantees that @xmath3 and @xmath5 differ in exactly @xmath166 of the bits !",
    "hence bob will always give the correct answer .",
    "what about efficient _ classical _ protocols ( without entanglement ) for this problem ?",
    "proving lower bounds on communication complexity often requires a very technical combinatorial analysis .",
    "buhrman , cleve , and wigderson used a deep combinatorial result of frankl and rdl   to prove that every classical errorless protocol for this problem needs to send at least @xmath173 bits .",
    "we give the details in appendix  [ app : dj ] .",
    "this @xmath167-qubits - vs-@xmath173-bits example was the first exponentially large separation of quantum and classical communication complexity .",
    "notice , however , that the difference disappears if we move to the _ bounded - error _ setting , allowing the protocol to have some small error probability .",
    "we can use the randomized protocol for equality discussed above or even simpler : alice can just send a few @xmath174 pairs to bob , who then compares the @xmath139 s with his @xmath175 s .",
    "if @xmath135 he will not see a difference , but if @xmath3 and @xmath5 differ in @xmath166 positions , then bob will probably detect this .",
    "hence @xmath133 classical bits of communication suffice in the bounded - error setting , in sharp contrast to the errorless setting .",
    "now consider the intersection function , which is 1 if @xmath9 for at least one @xmath8 .",
    "note that this is a decision problem of the appointment - scheduling problem mentioned in the introduction .",
    "buhrman , cleve , and wigderson  @xcite also presented an efficient quantum protocol for this .",
    "their protocol is based on lov grover s famous quantum search algorithm  @xcite , which we will briefly sketch here .",
    "suppose there is some @xmath4-bit string @xmath176 and we would like to find an index @xmath8 such that @xmath177 .",
    "we can not `` look '' at @xmath176 directly , but we can apply the following unitary map : @xmath178 grover s algorithm starts in a uniform superposition @xmath179 and then repeatedly applies the following unitary _ grover iterate _ to the state : @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the @xmath167-qubit hadamard transform , and @xmath182 is the unitary that puts a ` @xmath183 ' in front of the all-0 state .",
    "suppose there are exactly @xmath21 solutions : @xmath21 indices @xmath8 where @xmath177",
    ". we will not give the analysis here ( see for instance  @xcite ) , but one can show that after about @xmath184 grover - iterations , most of the amplitude of the state sits on such solutions . measuring the state will now with high probability give us a solution .",
    "of course we may not know @xmath21 in advance , but there is a way to find a solution with high probability using @xmath185 grover - iterates even in that case .",
    "now what about the intersection problem ?",
    "note that we just want to find a solution for the string @xmath186 , which is the bit - wise and of @xmath3 and @xmath5 , since @xmath187 whenever both @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the idea is now to let alice run grover s algorithm to search for such a solution .",
    "clearly , she can prepare the uniform starting state herself .",
    "she can also apply @xmath190 and @xmath182 herself .",
    "the only thing where she needs bob s help , is in implementing @xmath191 .",
    "this they do as follows .",
    "whenever alice want to apply @xmath191 to a state @xmath192 she tags on her @xmath139 in an extra qubit and sends bob the state @xmath193 bob applies the unitary map @xmath194 and sends back the result .",
    "alice sets the last qubit back to @xmath51 ( which she can do unitarily because she has @xmath3 ) , and now she has the state @xmath195 ! thus we can simulate @xmath191 using 2 messages of @xmath196 qubits each .",
    "thus alice and bob can run grover s algorithm to find an intersection , using @xmath185 messages of @xmath133 qubits each , for total communication of @xmath197 qubits .",
    "later aaronson and ambainis   gave a more complicated protocol that uses @xmath185 qubits of communication .",
    "what about lower bounds ?",
    "it is a well - known result of classical communication complexity that classical bounded - error protocols for the intersection problem need about @xmath4 bits of communication  @xcite .",
    "thus we have a quadratic quantum - classical separation for this problem .",
    "could the separation be even bigger than quadratic ?",
    "this question was open for quite a few years after  @xcite appeared , until finally razborov  @xcite showed that any bounded - error quantum protocol for intersection needs to communicate about @xmath198 qubits .",
    "his proof is beautiful but deep and complicated .",
    "we sketch it in appendix  [ appquantumlowerbounds ] .",

    "we are interested here in correlations that obey the above three conditions , but that can not be obtained from local measurements on entangled states .",

    "thus this is an `` imaginary '' device in the sense that it can not be realized physically without alice and bob s devices being connected by some kind of communication channel .",

    "thus the fact that communication complexity is not trivial ( i.e. , that some communication complexity problems are hard whereas others are easy ) can be viewed as a partial characterization of the non - local correlations that can be obtained by local measurements on entangled particles .",
    "is this a complete characterization ?",
    "in particular , what is the exact noise threshold @xmath153 where non - local boxes with noise @xmath153 render communication complexity trivial ?",

    "that is , given a supply of non - local boxes that work correctly with probability @xmath153 , is it possible to produce , using only local operations , a non - local box with a success probability greater than @xmath153 ?",
    "for a first step in this direction , see  @xcite .      as discussed in the previous section , there are correlations , such as the non - local box , that can not be reproduced by local measurements on entangled particles , but that nevertheless obey the conditions of positivity , normalisation and no - signalling eqs .",

    "this question would address the question raised by popescu and rohrlich mentioned above , and would give us basic insights into communication complexity . indeed it would allow us to understand quantitatively the differences between shared randomness , shared entanglement , and non - local correlations , each of which can be viewed as a different resource for communication complexity . for instance",
    "answering this question can have immediate implications for communication complexity in the entanglement model , at least in the case where alice and bob use only one round of communication .    before addressing this question",

    "recently it has been shown how the quantum value @xmath376 could be bounded by a hierarchy of semidefinite programs  @xcite , although the issue of whether this hierarchy converges remains open  @xcite .",

    ", we thus have a protocol which provides , up to a small error , a classical simulation ( using @xmath426 bits of one - way communication ) of any measurement on entangled states of @xmath4 qubits .      remarkably it is also possible , at least in some cases , to _ perfectly _ simulate the quantum communication or quantum entanglement scenarios with _",

    "we do not tolerate any error .",
    "of course such exact simulations are in principle not necessary if one wants to interpret the results of real experiments , as any real experiment will always have small imperfections . but these exact simulations are interesting for at least two reasons . on the one hand",
    "they show that perfectly simulating quantum systems is not much more costly than approximately simulating them . on the other hand ,",
    "these exact simulations have quite interesting structures .",
    "one can hope that understanding these structures will help us understand the power ( and limitations ) of quantum communication .",
    "exact classical simulations of quantum correlations were first independently reported in  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite . here",
    "we review briefly the subsequent works on this topic .",
    "we first consider a weak model , where the _ average _ amount of classical communication is bounded ( but in the worse case the amount of classical communication may be infinite ) .",
    "this model was first used in  @xcite in the context of classical simulation of a single ebit . in  @xcite",
    "this approach was generalized to the simulation of communicating @xmath4 qubits , or the simulation of povm measurements on @xmath4 ebits , using @xmath426 bits of two - way classical communication on average .",
    "a stronger and more interesting model is when the amount of classical communication is bounded ( even in the worst case ) .",
    "this model was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the simulations were improved , and in  @xcite it was shown that the classical simulation of projective measurements on a single ebit could be realized with a single bit of classical communication from alice to bob , and the communication of a single qubit could be simulated with 2 bits of communication .",
    "note that these simulations use an infinite amount of shared randomness , a requirement that was shown in  @xcite to be necessary when the amount of communication is bounded ( in the worst case ) .",
    "an even stronger model for the simulation of entanglement is for alice and bob to use as resource non - local boxes , rather than classical communication . indeed , as discussed in section  [ sec : nlbox ] , one bit of classical communication can be used to realize a non - local box , but a non - local box can not be used to communicate .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that simulating projective measurements on a single ebit could be carried out with the use of a single non - local box . a unified approach to protocols simulating a single ebit with one bit of communication or with one non - local box",
    "was presented in  @xcite .",
    "in this section we put a constraint on the quantum model .",
    "we will suppose that any measurement on a quantum system gives the results predicted by quantum mechanics with probability @xmath445 , and does not give any result with probability @xmath446 .",
    "the motivation for considering this model is that most quantum communication experiments use photons .",
    "photons are very practical because they can be quite easily produced , manipulated , transmitted over long distances , and measured .",
    "unfortunately photons get absorbed during transmission ( in commercial optical fibers , photons have approximately 50% probability of being absorbed after travelling 15 km ) , and single - photon detectors have limited efficiency : they will sometimes not detect a photon even though it is present .",
    "these effects can be described by the above model .    in most experiments to date , the detector efficiency @xmath445 was so low that the correlations could be explained by a classical model using shared randomness and no communication ( a local hidden variable model ) .",
    "this is called the _ detection loophole _  @xcite .",
    "thus for instance in the chsh experiment , the correlations can be explained by a local hidden variable model if @xmath447 .",
    "a detector efficiency better than this bound has not ( yet ) been achieved in experiments involving only photons .",
    "one solution to the above problem is technological : one should use a quantum system on which measurements can be carried out with high efficiency . in this respect atoms or ions are particularly interesting , because measurements on these systems can be carried out with essentially @xmath448 efficiency .",
    "thus experiments involving two entangled ions have been carried out in which the detection loophole was closed  @xcite . however these experiments have not yet allowed both the detection loophole and the locality loophole ( i.e. , carrying out both measurements at spatially separated locations ) to be closed simultaneously .    instead of ( or in addition to )",
    "improved technology , another solution to this problem is to develop new non - locality tests that demonstrate non - locality with low detector efficiency . as we shall see in the following , the communication problems and protocols developed in the previous sections can be used to build such tests .",
    "communication complexity suggests that by increasing the dimension @xmath299 of the entangled system under study , one can decrease exponentially ( in @xmath299 ) the required efficiency of the detectors .",
    "indeed , it appears that in many cases the minimum number @xmath23 of bits of classical communication required to reproduce the quantum correlations is related to the minimum efficiency of the detectors required for the correlations to be non - local by @xmath449 . that there should be a relation between @xmath23 and @xmath445",
    "was first noted in  @xcite and further studied in  @xcite .    to understand this relation we will compare two classical schemes :    * in the first scheme , which was discussed at length in sections  [ sec : nl ] and  [ sec : nlandcc ] , the detectors have @xmath448 efficiency , the parties have shared randomness and",
    "may exchange up to @xmath23 bits of classical communication . * in the second scheme , the parties have shared randomness , and each party has a detector of efficiency @xmath445 .",
    "this means that each party will with probability @xmath445 give an output , and with probability @xmath446 produce no output .",
    "the detectors are assumed to be independent , so that the probability that both detectors give an output is @xmath450 . in the physics terminology",
    "this would be called a local hidden variable model with detector efficiency @xmath445 .",
    "( we will also consider below the case where one of the detectors has efficiency @xmath445 , and the other always gives a result , i.e. , is @xmath448 efficient . )",
    "these two schemes can be related in a number of ways .",

    "each party checks whether @xmath40 is a conversation that is consistent with their input .",
    "if it is then they give the corresponding output , if it is not then they do nt give any output .",
    "the probability that both alice and bob give an output is at least @xmath452 .",
    "this protocol is not perfect since the probability that the parties give an output may differ from one party to the other , or from one input to the other .",
    "what is interesting is that in a number of cases the converse holds : if the quantum correlations can not be reproduced with less than @xmath23 bits of communication , then they can be reproduced without communication only if the detector efficiency @xmath445 is less than @xmath453 .",
    "a first example where this converse occurs , is when bounds on @xmath23 and on the minimum detection efficiency @xmath445 can be obtained from the size of monochromatic rectangles ( see appendix  [ appclassicallowerbounds ] for a brief presentation of this notion ) .",
    "this approach was implicit in  @xcite where it was shown that the correlations of the distributed deutsch - jozsa problem could not be reproduced by a local hidden variable model if @xmath454 when the inputs consist of @xmath4-bit strings , and hence the parties use a maximally entangled system of dimension @xmath4 . using the size of monochromatic rectangles was exploited more fully in @xcite in the context of a multipartite communication complexity problem , and then extended in  @xcite to take into account the possibility of errors . in particular , in  @xcite it was shown how one could obtain a lower bound @xmath455 on the minimum amount of communication required to reproduce the correlations , where @xmath456 is a function of the size and discrepancy of rectangles .",
    "it then followed that the correlations could be obtained by a local hidden variable model with detectors of efficiency @xmath445 only if @xmath457 ( where @xmath4 is the number of parties ) .",
    "if the rectangle lower bound on @xmath23 is close to tight , then this implies the relation we mentioned above between @xmath23 and @xmath445 .",
    "another interesting example arises if we suppose that alice s detector is inefficient , but that bob s detector is perfect .",
    "this situation is motivated by the experimental situation reported in  @xcite , where an ion is entangled with a photon . as discussed above , the measurements on the ion",
    "can be done with @xmath448 efficiency , whereas those on the photon will be inefficient .",
    "the problem in which alice s detector is inefficient and bob s detector is perfect was previously investigated from the point of view of the detection loophole in  @xcite for entangled systems of dimension 2 .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]    from the point of view of communication complexity , closing the detection loophole is more important than closing the locality loophole . indeed ,",
    "if the detection loophole is not closed , it means that the raw data can be explained by a model without communication .",
    "on the other hand , if the detection loophole is closed , then , by sharing the entanglement , the parties have a resource that could only be reproduced classically by communication between the parties .",
    "the same is true in other applications of quantum non - locality : closing the detection loophole ( but not necessarily the locality loophole ) allows one to increase the security of quantum key distribution  @xcite .",
    "the progress in quantum communication complexity points the way towards new tests of quantum non - locality which use not one ebit , as in the chsh test , but many ebits .",
    "ideas for these new tests come from the entanglement - based deutsch - jozsa problem discussed in section  [ sec : nlandcc ] , the entanglement - based hidden matching problem discussed in section  [ hmp ] , recent work of gavinsky  @xcite , and also the ( non - constructive ) results on three - party correlations reported in  @xcite .",
    "there are at least two motivations for such experiments .",
    "first of all they could be more robust against experimental imperfections ( such as the detection loophole or errors ) than non - locality tests used at present .",
    "second they could illustrate the efficiency of quantum mechanics over classical mechanics , as experiments on a small number @xmath462 of ebits could only be reproduced classically using an exponentially large ( in @xmath462 ) amount @xmath23 of classical communication .",
    "these non - locality experiments on a many ebits can be characterized by several parameters . in particular",
    "these would include the number @xmath462 of ebits involved , or equivalently the dimension @xmath463 of the entangled quantum system ; the minimum detector efficiency @xmath445 required for the correlations to be non - local ; the amount @xmath464 of errors that can be tolerated ; and the amount @xmath23 of classical communication that would be required to reproduce the quantum correlations .",
    "in general , for any given non - locality test , we can expect tradeoffs between @xmath445 , @xmath464 and @xmath23 .",
    "an important point to note is that the proposals inspired by communication complexity typically are asymptotic results that deal with the limit where the number of ebits tends towards infinity : @xmath465 .",
    "however real experiments will deal with small values of @xmath462 .",
    "for instance , if we think of the detection loophole , one should recall that this is only a problem for experiments dealing with entangled photons . on the other hand",
    ", the hilbert space of a single photon can be larger than  2 .",
    "one can thus effectively manipulate more than one qubit , while manipulating only a single photon .",
    "this is potentially an interesting opportunity .",
    "indeed it would be very interesting to devise non - locality experiments that tolerate inefficient detectors ( say @xmath466 ) in hilbert spaces of moderate dimension ( say @xmath467 ) .",
    "if one could devise such a non - locality experiment , there would be a strong incentive to realize it experimentally . indeed whereas experiments involving entangled atoms or ions may be the short - term solution to solving the detection loophole , such experiments are much slower and much more expensive than experiments involving photons only .",
    "numerical searches for such a non - locality experiment have been undertaken , but unsuccessfully so far  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "quantum communication complexity suggests the possibility of new non - locality experiments on a moderate number of ebits that either are very resistant to imperfections , or require very large amounts of classical resources to reproduce classically .",
    "realizing such experiments will require further progress on the theoretical and experimental side .",
    "the experimental situation concerning communication complexity proper is less advanced .",
    "indeed , in order to carry out any nontrivial experimental demonstration of communication complexity , one needs to take into account the limited efficiency of detectors which has been such a plague for non - locality experiments . in this respect ,",
    "the first convincing communication complexity experiment to date is that reported in  @xcite in which 6 parties , materialized by waveplates along a beam on an optical table , carried out the communication complexity problem proposed in  , but in the version proposed in  @xcite , which does not use entanglement . in this experiment",
    "the limited efficiency of detectors was explicitly taken into account .",
    "experiments that studied the entanglement - based version of this problem while explicitly taking into account the limited efficiency of the detectors have also been reported  @xcite , based on the proposal of  @xcite .",
    "another protocol which has been studied experimentally is quantum fingerprinting which in the smp model performs exponentially better than classical protocols ( see section  [ ssecqfpprotocol ] ) .",
    "the possibility of realizing such an experiment at a small scale involving one or a few photons has been discussed in  @xcite , and later performed using photons  @xcite and in nmr  @xcite .    in the future",
    "we may expect further proof - of - principle experiments of quantum communication complexity involving the exchange of more qubits and larger distance between the parties .",
    "good candidates for such experiments are raz s communication complexity problem , the hidden matching problem and its extensions , and quantum fingerprinting .",
    "quantum communication complexity and quantum non - locality are by now mature fields . but many questions remain open . here",
    "we collect a few .    1 .   * additional natural problems in quantum communication complexity . *",
    "find additional problems  if possible natural problems that could have potential applications  for which quantum communication is much more efficient than classical commmunication .",
    "how much entanglement is needed to get a reduction of communication : equivalence of quantum communication and entanglement models of communication complexity . * in the entanglement model of communication complexity , the parties have an unlimited supply of entanglement and use it to reduce the amount of classical communication .",
    "how much entanglement is really needed ? in classical communication complexity with shared randomness newman s theorem  @xcite states that , if we allow a small increase in the error probability , the parties need only have @xmath133 shared random bits ( where @xmath4 is the size of the inputs ) .",
    "does something similar hold when we replace shared randomness by entanglement ? answering this question would essentially establish whether the quantum communication and the entanglement models of communication complexity are equivalent 3 .   *",
    "are most quantum states useful for communication complexity ? *",
    "it was recently shown in @xcite that most @xmath4-qubit states ( with respect to the uniform measure ) are not useful ",
    "they are typically too entangled  in the measurement - based version of quantum computation .",
    "are most states useful for communication complexity ? for two parties",
    "the answer is yes , as they can work in the schmidt basis . but consider three parties sharing a random state of @xmath152 qubits ( each party having @xmath4 qubits ) .",
    "how useful are most states for communication complexity ( asymptotically as @xmath4 tends to infinity ) ? 4 .",
    "* find new non - local games , qualitatively different from existing ones . *",
    "in particular consider the following more specific subquestions : * for two - party xor games , the ratio between the classical and the quantum value of the game is bounded by a constant .",
    "however in @xcite it was shown  using a non - constructive proof  that this is not the case for three - party games .",
    "can one exhibit an explicit example of this type ?",
    "* find bell inequalities involving rather small systems , say where the dimension of each party s hilbert space is less than @xmath467 , which allow for very small detector efficiencies .",
    "non - local boxes and communication complexity . * as discussed in section  [ sec : nlbox ] , non - local boxes are an interesting resource to consider from the point of view of communication complexity . in this regard ,",
    "two interesting questions are : * first , what is the noise threshold below which non - local boxes make communication complexity trivial ( see @xcite for a formulation of this problem ) . is this threshold the maximum value @xmath468 attainable by local measurements on entangled quantum systems ?",
    "* second , is it possible to amplify non - local correlations , in the sense that given a large number of devices that will produce correlations @xmath469 corresponding to pr boxes with noise @xmath153 , is it possible to use the devices in such a way as to produce correlations with a lower value of @xmath153 ?",
    "a first result in this direction can be found in @xcite .",
    "* simulation of quantum correlations and quantum communication . * in this context , some questions that come to mind are : * exact simulation of more than one qubit or ebit using bounded classical communication ( in the worse case ) or non - local boxes . some preliminary results on this topic have been obtained in the particular case where alice and bob carry out measurements with binary outcomes  @xcite . * the simulation of non - maximally entangled states using non - local boxes .",
    "this appears to be much harder than the simulation of maximally entangled states , see  @xcite for some first results . *",
    "the simulation of multipartite non - local correlations .",
    "communication complexity is a task for which quantum information can beat classical information .",
    "such tasks are rare , and finding more potential applications of quantum information is very important .",
    "unfortunately most quantum communication complexity problems are either extremely sensitive to noise , highly contrived , or do not offer exponential gains over the best classical protocols ( in which case the advantages of quantum communication will probably be more than offset by the lower cost and higher speed of classical communication ) .",
    "the most interesting proposal so far is maybe the smp model without shared randomness ( a somewhat contrived model ) where equality ( a very natural problem ) can be solved exponentially more efficiently using quantum communication .",
    "thus there is the tantalizing possibility that some time in the future , quantum communication complexity could be used in practical applications .",
    "independently of whether quantum communication complexity ever finds some real - world applications , the results obtained so far have important conceptual implications .",
    "first of all they offer new insights into the power of quantum information , and in particular of quantum computing",
    ". indeed the basic aim of computer science , taken in a wide sense , is to accomplish a task by using the minimum amount of resources . in the usual formulation ,",
    "the resource that we want to minimize is the running time of the computer .",
    "this is the most important application of quantum computing as shor s algorithm suggests that a quantum computer would allow exponential speedups .",
    "but in this context it is very difficult  if not impossible  to prove that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers .",
    "the advantage of quantum computation can however be proven in simpler contexts such as the black - box model of quantum computing , where the resource that is quantified is the number of calls to an oracle ; or communication complexity where the resource that is quantified is the amount of communication .",
    "the existence of these models where it can be rigorously shown that quantum information offers important advantages over classical information reinforces our confidence that quantum computers are much more powerful than classical computers for certain tasks .",
    "second , the study of quantum communication complexity has led to the proposal of new tests of quantum mechanics . indeed from bell",
    "onwards it was known that if one wants to replace quantum mechanics by a classical model , this classical model would have to use faster than light signalling .",
    "the discovery of fast quantum algorithms suggested that such a classical model would use an exponentially large number of resources .",
    "quantum communication complexity has now advanced to the point where it may be possible to propose experiments in which one can prove that a classical simulation would require exponentially more resources than are used quantum mechanically .    in summary ,",
    "quantum communication complexity is now a mature field that has led to some fundamental insights into the nature of computation and the foundations of physics .",

    "separations between quantum and classical communication complexity always require two things : an efficient quantum protocol for some problem , and a _ lower bound _ on the communication of all classical protocols solving that same problem . in this appendix",
    "we will give some tools for lower bounding classical communication complexity , leading eventually to the lower bound on classical protocols for the distributed deutsch - jozsa problem that we mentioned in section  [ secdistributeddj ] .",
    "consider some communication complexity problem @xmath482 , where alice starts with an input @xmath128 and bob starts with an input @xmath129 .",
    "we start by introducing the crucial combinatorial notion for classical lower bounds .",
    "rectangle _ is a set @xmath483 that is of the form @xmath484 with @xmath485 and @xmath486 . for example , if @xmath487 and @xmath488 , @xmath489 then @xmath490 is a rectangle .",
    "the following result is a fundamental property of classical deterministic protocols .",
    "if a deterministic protocol has communication @xmath23 , then there exist @xmath491 rectangles @xmath492 that partition @xmath127 , such that the protocol gives the same output @xmath297 for each @xmath493 .",
    "we omit the easy proof of this lemma , which is by induction on @xmath23 .",
    "for example , suppose there is only one @xmath0-bit message @xmath214 going from alice to bob and then bob returns the 1-bit output .",
    "then the @xmath494 rectangles would be of the form @xmath495 , with @xmath496 and @xmath497 , where @xmath498 is the set of @xmath3 s for which alice sends @xmath0-bit message @xmath214 , and @xmath499 is the set of @xmath5 s for which bob returns output @xmath12 when receiving message @xmath214 .",
    "note that if our protocol computes @xmath7 correctly , then the rectangles are `` monochromatic '' : the protocol returns the same answer @xmath6 for all @xmath493 .    as a simple application of this we prove the so - called `` rank lower bound '' . consider some communication complexity problem @xmath482 .",
    "let @xmath500 be the @xmath501 matrix whose entries are defined by @xmath502 .",
    "this is called the _ communication matrix _ of @xmath7 .",
    "it can be viewed as a 2-dimensional truth table .",
    "we use @xmath503 to denote the rank of this matrix over the field of real numbers .",
    "for example , the communication matrix for the equality function is the @xmath504 identity matrix , which has 1s on its diagonal and 0s elsewhere .",
    "hence @xmath505 .",
    "suppose we have some @xmath23-bit deterministic protocol that computes @xmath7 .",
    "we know that this partitions the input space @xmath127 into rectangles @xmath492 .",
    "since each 1-input @xmath506 occurs in exactly one 1-rectangle , we have @xmath507 where we view @xmath508 as a @xmath504 matrix with 1s on its elements and 0s elsewhere .",
    "note that @xmath508 is a matrix of rank 1 .",
    "hence , using @xmath509 , we get @xmath510 but that means that a lower bound on the rank of @xmath500 implies a lower bound on the communication ! in particular , it follows that for the equality problem , the communication @xmath23 needs to be at least @xmath4 .      in a randomized protocol , alice and bob may flip coins and the protocol has to output the right value @xmath6 with probability @xmath132 for all @xmath130 .",
    "we can fix these coins to obtain a deterministic protocol .",
    "suppose randomized protocol @xmath511 uses @xmath23 bits of communication and has success probability @xmath162 on all inputs .",
    "let @xmath512 if the protocol gives the correct output @xmath6 on input @xmath381 using coin flips @xmath513 for alice and @xmath514 for bob , and @xmath515 otherwise . for each @xmath381 ,",

    ", there exists a way to fix @xmath513 and @xmath514 such that the success probability ( under @xmath520 ) of the resulting _",
    "protocol is at least @xmath162 .",
    "accordingly , if we want to lower bound the randomized communication complexity of a function , it suffices to find some `` hard '' input distribution @xmath520 , and to show that all _ deterministic _ protocols that have error at most @xmath521 under that distribution , need a lot of communication .",
    "the reason why the step to deterministic protocols is helpful , is that deterministic protocols partition the input space into rectangles as we ve seen before .",
    "suppose we can show that all `` large '' rectangles in the communication matrix have roughly as many 0s as 1s in them ( weighed according to @xmath520 ) .",
    "then the protocol will make a large error on all large rectangles .",
    "conversely , if we know the protocol does not make a large error , most of its rectangles must have been `` small '' .",
    "but that can only be if there are many rectangles .",
    "since the number of rectangles is @xmath491 , the communication @xmath23 must have been large .",
    "this idea leads to the following lower bound method .",
    "the _ discrepancy _ of rectangle @xmath484 under @xmath520 is the difference between the weight of the 0s and the 1s in that rectangle : @xmath522 the discrepancy of @xmath7 under @xmath520 is the maximum over all rectangles : @xmath523 if @xmath7 has small discrepancy , that means that all `` large '' rectangles are roughly balanced .",
    "suppose a deterministic protocol partitions the input space into rectangles @xmath492 .",
    "suppose it has success probability @xmath524 . the best bias ( difference between success and failure probabilities ) that the protocol can achieve on rectangle @xmath508 , is @xmath525 , by giving the output with highest weight in that rectangle .",
    "the success probability is @xmath526 and the error probability is @xmath527 , where @xmath297 is the majority value of @xmath7 on the pairs @xmath528 , weighted according to @xmath520 .",
    "hence we have @xmath529 this is a lower bound on the communication : @xmath530 .",
    "accordingly , a distribution @xmath520 where @xmath531 is small gives a lower bound on the communication of deterministic protocols for @xmath7 under @xmath520 , and then the same lower bound applies to randomized protocols .",
    "to illustrate the discrepancy lower bound technique , we now consider the inner product function , defined by @xmath532 .",
    "we will show that its discrepancy under the uniform distribution is very small .",
    "we analyze the @xmath504 matrix @xmath99 whose @xmath506 entry is @xmath533 .",
    "this is just the communication matrix for @xmath232 , with 0s replaced by 1s , and 1s replaced by @xmath86s .",
    "lindsey s lemma shows that large rectangles in @xmath99 are quite balanced :    for every rectangle @xmath484 , the absolute value of the sum of the @xmath99-entries in that rectangle is at most @xmath534 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath99 is symmetric and @xmath535 .",
    "this implies , for any vector @xmath207 , @xmath536 where the norm is the usual euclidean vector length .",
    "let @xmath537 and @xmath538 be the characteristic ( column ) vectors of the sets @xmath511 and @xmath539 .",
    "the sum of the @xmath99-entries in @xmath540 is @xmath541 .",
    "we can bound this using cauchy - schwarz : @xmath542    let @xmath543 be the uniform input distribution .",
    "note that the discrepancy of the rectangle @xmath540 under @xmath520 is exactly the difference of @xmath85 s and @xmath86 s in @xmath540 , divided by @xmath544 . by lindsey s lemma ,",
    "this is @xmath545 . because @xmath546 , it follows that the discrepancy of the inner product function under the uniform distribution is @xmath547",
    "hence we get a @xmath166 lower bound on the randomized communication complexity of .",
    "recall the distributed deutsch - jozsa problem from section  [ secdistributeddj ] .",
    "buhrman , cleve , and wigderson  @xcite used a combinatorial result of frankl and rdl   to prove the following classical lower bound :    every deterministic classical protocol that solves the distributed deutsch - jozsa problem , needs to communicate at least @xmath173 bits .",
