    "the object of this article is the study of the existence of @xmath0-automorphic quasimeromorphic mappings ( in the sense of martio and srebro  see [ ms1 ] ) @xmath2 , @xmath3 ; i.e. such that @xmath4 were @xmath0 is kleinian group acting upon @xmath5 .",
    "+ our principal goal is to prove the following :    let @xmath0 be a kleinian group with torsion acting upon @xmath6 .",
    "+ if the elliptic elements ( i.e. torsion elements ) of @xmath0 have uniformly bounded orders , + then there exists a non constant @xmath0-automorphic quasimeromorphic mapping + @xmath7    in this paper we restrict ourselves to the proof of the theorem in the classical case ( i.e. @xmath8 ) only .",
    "this restriction is motivated by two reasons : ( a ) the proof in the @xmath9-dimensional case employs mainly elementary tools and ( b ) it develops and uses a technique for for meshing distinct fat triangulations while preserving fatness , technique that is relevant in computational geometry and mathematical biology .",
    "the proof of the general case is presented in @xcite and it is based upon a more general result concerning the existence of fat triangulations for manifolds with boundary  see @xcite .    the question whether quasimeromorphic mappings exist",
    "was originally posed by martio and srebro in @xcite ; subsequently in @xcite they proved the existence of fore - mentioned mappings in the case of co - finite groups i.e. groups such that @xmath10 ( the important case of geometrically finite groups being thus included ) .",
    "also , it was later proved by tukia ( @xcite ) that the existence of non - constant quasimeromorphic mappings ( or qm - maps , in short ) is assured in the case when g acts torsionless upon @xmath5 . moreover , since for torsionless kleinian groups @xmath0 , @xmath11 is a ( analytic ) manifold , the next natural question to ask is whether there exist qm - maps @xmath12 ; where @xmath13 is an orientable @xmath14manifold .",
    "the affirmative answer to this question is due to k. peltonen ( see @xcite ) ; to be more precise she proved the existence of qm - maps in the case when @xmath13 is a connected , orientable @xmath15-riemannian manifold .",
    "in contrast with the above results it was proved by srebro ( @xcite ) that , for any @xmath16 , there exists a kleinian group @xmath17 s.t . there exists no non - constant , @xmath18automorphic function @xmath19 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath0 ( as above ) contains elliptics of unbounded orders ( with non - degenerate fixed set ) , then @xmath0 admits no non - constant @xmath18automorphic qm - mappings .",
    "since all the existence results were obtained in constructive manner by using the classical `` alexander trick '' ( see @xcite ) , it is only natural that we try to attack the problem using the same method .",
    "for this reason we present here in succinct manner alexander s method : one starts by constructing a suitable triangulation ( euclidian or hyperbolic ) of @xmath5 or of @xmath20 . since @xmath5 and @xmath13 are orientable , an orientation consistent with the given triangulation ( i.e. such that two given @xmath21-simplices having a @xmath22-dimensional face in common will have opposite orientations ) can be chosen .",
    "then one quasiconformally maps the simplices of the triangulation into @xmath23 in a chess - table manner : the positively oriented ones onto the interior of the standard simplex in @xmath24 and the negatively oriented ones onto its exterior . if the dilatations of the @xmath25-maps constructed above are uniformly bounded ( as is the case of compact manifolds @xmath13 ) , then the resulting map will be quasimeromorphic .",
    "the dilatations of each of the @xmath25-maps above is dictated by the proportions of the respective simplex ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , and since the dilatation is to be uniformly bounded , we are naturally directing our efforts in the construction of a * fat * triangulation , where :    a k - simplex @xmath26 ( or @xmath5 ) ; @xmath27 is @xmath28_-fat _ if there exists @xmath29 s.t . the ratio @xmath30 ; where @xmath31 denotes the radius of the inscribed sphere of @xmath32 ( inradius ) and @xmath33 denotes the radius of the circumscribed sphere of @xmath32 ( circumradius ) .",
    "+ a triangulation ( of a submanifold of @xmath24 or @xmath5 ) @xmath34 is @xmath28_-fat _ if all its simplices are f - fat . +",
    "a triangulation @xmath35 is _ fat _ if there exists @xmath29 s.t .",
    "all its simplices are @xmath28_-fat _ ; @xmath36    the idea of the proof of theorem 1.1 . is first to build two fat triangulations : @xmath37 of a certain closed neighbourhood @xmath38 of the fixed set of @xmath0 in @xmath39 ; and @xmath40 of @xmath41 ; and then to `` mash '' the two triangulations into a new triangulation , while retaining their fatness .",
    "+ the first triangulation is constructive and is based upon the geometry of the elliptic transformations .",
    "the existence of the second triangulation is assured by peltonen s result .",
    "unfortunately , these two triangulations are not @xmath0-invariant , so they are unsuited for our purpose of building a @xmath0-automorphic function .",
    "however , they induce fat triangulations : @xmath42 on @xmath43 , and @xmath44 on @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a differential manifold with boundary @xmath47 . + fortunately , we are provided with a ready made method of mashing triangulations , so we can direct our efforts towards the task of `` fattening '' the simplices of the `` intermediate zone '' ; task which will be carried out in section 4 .",
    "+ the `` mashing '' method mentioned above is based on a result and , even more , on the technique used in its proof , due to munkres :    let @xmath48 be a @xmath49-manifold with boundary .",
    "then any @xmath49-triangulation of @xmath50 can be extended to a @xmath49-triangulation of @xmath48 , @xmath51 .",
    "because of its importance to our own construction , we shall present the basic idea of the proof of theorem 1.3 . in the next section . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the necessarily background on elliptic transformations and present in a nutshell the main techniques we employ : the alexander trick , peltonen s method and the proof of munkres theorem . in section 3",
    "we show how to choose and triangulate the closed neighbourhood of the @xmath52 of the fixed set of @xmath0 , and how to select the `` intermediate zone '' where the two different triangulations overlap .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to the main task of fattening the common triangulation .",
    "finally , in section 5 we indicate the way of adapting our construction to higher dimensions .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves mainly to the @xmath9-dimen - sional case , for , as we have already stated , this will be the direction in which our main efforts will be directed .",
    "+ let us first recall the basic definitions and notations : a transformation @xmath53 , @xmath54 is called _ elliptic _ if @xmath55 s.t .",
    "@xmath56 , and @xmath57 is called the _ order _ of @xmath28 . in the @xmath9-dimensional case",
    "the _ fixed point set _ of f , i.e. @xmath58 , is a hyperbolic line and will be denoted by @xmath59 - the _ axis of f_. if @xmath60 is an axes of an elliptic of order @xmath57 , then @xmath60 is called an @xmath61 . +",
    "if the discrete group @xmath0 is acting upon @xmath62 , then by the discreteness of @xmath0 , there exists no accumulation point of the elliptic axes in @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath0 contains no elliptics with intersecting axes , then the distances between the axes are , in general , bounded from bellow .",
    "to be more precise , the following holds :    let @xmath0 be a discrete group @xmath0 acting upon @xmath62 , and let @xmath63 be s.t .",
    "@xmath64 or @xmath65 ; and s.t .",
    "+ then @xmath67 , that is independent of @xmath68 s.t .",
    "@xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the hyperbolic distance in @xmath62 .",
    "it is extremely important to notice that the results above do not include the case when all the elliptic transformations of @xmath0 are of order @xmath71 , since they depend intrinsically upon :    [ @xcite , @xcite ] @xmath72 is discrete iff  @xmath73 is discrete ; @xmath74 .",
    "the theorem above is of little avail in the case of two _ half - turns _ ( that is elliptics of order @xmath71 ) ; since any two half - turns ( in @xmath75 ) generate a discrete group .",
    "( see @xcite for a proof of this `` folkloric '' result from an unpublished paper by jrgensen . ) indeed , examples of discrete groups of isometries of hyperbolic @xmath9-space can be constructed , such that the distances between the axes of the order @xmath71 elliptics are not bound from bellow ( see @xcite ) .    in the presence of _ node points _",
    "( i.e. intersections of axes ) the situation is more complicated",
    ". fortunately , there are only a few types of such possible intersections - for the orders of the elliptic axes meeting at a node point must satisfy certain conditions ( determined by the euler number for the orbifold ) ; namely , the possible local situations in orbifold are : either ( a ) _ dihedral _ , i.e. of the type @xmath76 ; or one of the following exceptional types : ( b ) _ tetrahedral _ , i.e. of type @xmath77 ; ( c ) _ octahedral _ , i.e. of type @xmath78 ; ( d ) _ icosahedral _ ,",
    "i.e. of type @xmath79 ; ( see fig",
    ". 1 ) .",
    "the reduced number of possibilities is rather fortunate , for the computation of the distances between node points is more difficult than that of distances between disjoint axes .",
    "( for more specific information in this direction of study see @xcite and @xcite ; and more recently @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .    since our main interest lies in kleinian groups acting upon @xmath62 whose elliptic elements have orders bounded from above , the following theorem is highly relevant :    let @xmath0 be finitelly generated kleinian group acting on @xmath80 .",
