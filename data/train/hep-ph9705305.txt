    "<S> a precise understanding of the background processes yielding two photon final states is therefore crucial for higgs searches at the lhc .    </S>",
    "<S> photons produced in hadronic collisions arise essentially from two different sources : ` direct ' or ` prompt ' photon production via the hard partonic processes such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 or through the ` fragmentation ' of a hadronic jet into a single photon carrying a large fraction of the jet energy . </S>",
    "<S> the former gives rise to perturbatively calculable short - distance contributions whereas the latter is primarily a long distance process which can not be calculated perturbatively and is described in terms of the quark - to - photon fragmentation function  @xcite . in principle , this fragmentation contribution could be suppressed to a certain extent by imposing isolation cuts on the photon , typically formulated by limiting the amount of hadronic energy allowed within an isolation cone around the photon . however , the matching of experimental isolation cones onto a theoretical calculation beyond the lowest order level is far from trivial  @xcite , and it has been shown that a sizeable contribution to the isolated photon cross section from the quark - to - photon fragmentation process remains even after isolation cuts have been applied  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all estimates of the fragmentation contribution to the production of one or two final state photons in hadron collisions so far  @xcite have had to rely on a model of the photon fragmentation function . </S>",
    "<S> this function obeys a perturbative evolution equation with a non - perturbative boundary condition usually parameterized in the form of an initial distribution at some low starting scale @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> several models , based either on an asymptotic solution of the evolution equation  @xcite or on estimates of the non - perturbative boundary conditions inspired by vector meson dominance models  @xcite can be found in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the lack of a precise knowledge on the quark - to - photon fragmentation function introduces a _ non - quantifiable _ systematic uncertainty into any theoretical calculation of photon production cross sections </S>",
    "<S> . a precise determination of the process independent quark - to - photon fragmentation function is therefore needed and the results obtained in the remainder of this letter should help to achieve this .    a first measurement of the quark - to - photon fragmentation function has been performed  @xcite by the aleph collaboration at cern from an analysis of two jet events in which one of the jets contains a photon carrying a large fraction ( @xmath10 ) of the jet energy . in these ` photon ' </S>",
    "<S> +  1 jet events , a democratic approach is used to group the particles into jets and the photon is clustered simultaneously with the other hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between this measured rate and the calculated rate up to @xmath11 @xcite yielded a first determination @xcite of the quark - to - photon fragmentation function accurate at this order . </S>",
    "<S> both theoretical and experimental analyses used the durham jet algorithm @xcite . note that @xmath12 , the fraction of electromagnetic energy within the ` photon ' jet , is in general different from the parameter @xmath13 considered in inclusive photon production  @xcite . in the collinear core of the ` photon jet ' however , where the non - perturbative effects arise , the definitions of these two parameters coincide .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present letter , we report the results of a calculation of the @xmath14 qcd corrections to the ` photon ' +  1 jet rate , performed using the same democratic approach . </S>",
    "<S> together with the published data @xcite , this enables us to obtain a first determination of the process independent quark - to - photon fragmentation function at @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the details of this calculation will be presented in a subsequent publication  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a common feature of all model estimates of the quark - to - photon fragmentation function  @xcite is the resummation of leading @xmath16 and subleading @xmath17 logarithms of the mass factorization scale @xmath18 to all orders in the strong coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this resummation procedure seem to suggest that the photon fragmentation function is @xmath19 and that quark and gluon fragmentation into photons contribute at the same order . </S>",
    "<S> this view is widely held for the photon fragmentation as well as for the photon structure function . however , in the region of high @xmath12 and where jets are resolved , this is not necessarily the correct procedure to adopt . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the distribution of electromagnetic energy within the photon jet of photon + 1 jet events , for a single quark of charge @xmath20 , can be written @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents terms where the photon is perturbatively isolated ( proportional to @xmath23 and other perturbative contributions which are well behaved as @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - perturbative fragmentation function is a solution of , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is determined by the jet clustering algorithm . in the durham jet clustering algorithm and at large @xmath12 , @xmath27 @xcite where @xmath5 is the transverse momentum of the photon with respect to the cluster . in the usual approach , </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the evolution equation for @xmath28 , is proportional to @xmath29 where @xmath9 is some small scale and the conventional assignment of a power of @xmath30 to the fragmentation function is clearly motivated . for ` physical ' scale choices , @xmath31 , is more appropriate . ] and the perturbative contribution is suppressed relative to the fragmentation contribution , so that for @xmath32 , the fragmentation function is indeed more significant . </S>",
    "<S> however , at large @xmath12 , we see that the transverse size of the photon jet cluster decreases such that @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the hierarchy @xmath34 and @xmath35 is no longer preserved and both contributions in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sig0 ] ) are important . </S>",
    "<S> large logarithms of @xmath36 are the most dominant contributions . since , from the experimental point of view , we are required to observe isolated or almost isolated photons , this is precisely the region that we are most interested in . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we choose not to impose the conventional prejudice and resum the logarithms of @xmath18 _ a priori_. instead , we work within a fixed order framework , to isolate the relevant large logarithms .    as mentioned above , potentially large logarithms of @xmath36 are present and need to be resummed . at present </S>",
    "<S> however , we have not accomplished this resummation and , to avoid unstable behaviour at large @xmath12 , we choose a form of the fragmentation function that renders the calculation well behaved as @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is identical to the procedure applied in the lowest order calculation  @xcite and in the lowest order experimental analysis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus possible to make a direct comparison of our next - to - leading order results with these earlier leading order results , and to test the stability of the perturbative fixed order approach .       </S>",
    "<S> the photon +  1 jet rate in @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath37 receives contributions from five parton - level subprocesses displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : class ] :    * the tree level process @xmath38 , where the final state particles are clustered together such that a `` photon jet '' and one additional jet are observed in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> * the one loop gluon correction to the @xmath39 process , where the photon and one of the quarks are clustered together or the photon is isolated while both quarks form a single jet . </S>",
    "<S> * the process @xmath40 , where one of the quarks fragments into a photon while the remaining partons form only a single jet . </S>",
    "<S> * the one loop gluon correction to the @xmath41 process , where one of the quarks fragments into a photon . * </S>",
    "<S> the tree level process @xmath42 with a generic @xmath15 counterterm present in the _ bare _ quark - to - photon fragmentation function .    </S>",
    "<S> although the ` photon ' +  1 jet cross section is finite at @xmath15 , all these contributions contain divergences ( when the photon and/or the gluon are collinear with one of the quarks , when the gluon is soft or because the bare quark - to - photon fragmentation function contains infinite counter terms ) . </S>",
    "<S> these divergences need to be isolated and cancelled analytically . </S>",
    "<S> it is only after this cancellation has taken place , that it is possible to numerically evaluate the remaining finite contributions in a monte carlo program containing the experimental jet reconstruction algorithm , and ultimately to evaluate the ` photon ' +  1 jet rate at @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> the assignment of a single power of @xmath43 to the quark - to - photon fragmentation function ( and @xmath44 to the gluon - to - photon fragmentation function ) carries through when factorizing the explicit singularities present in the real and virtual processes with photon emission into the fragmentation functions . here </S>",
    "<S> , the leading perturbative counterterm in the quark - to - photon fragmentation function is @xmath11 while the leading counterterm in the gluon - to - photon fragmentation function is @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the gluon - to - photon fragmentation function plays no role at the fixed order @xmath44 ; since radiating the gluon contributes an additional factor of @xmath45 , it first contributes at @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , all of the model estimates  @xcite indicate that the gluon - to - photon fragmentation is orders of magnitude smaller than the quark - to - photon fragmentation function at large @xmath12 and we ignore it throughout .    following the philosophy of @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we use the concept of a theoretical resolution criterion @xmath47 to define the singular regions . within the singular regions , </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements are approximated and the unresolved variables analytically integrated . at next - to - leading order , </S>",
    "<S> most qcd processes receive singular contributions when either one gluon is soft or two particles are collinear  in other words a single particle is theoretically unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> however , the evaluation of the singular contributions associated with the process @xmath48 is of particular interest as it contains various ingredients which could directly be applied to the calculation of jet observables at next - to - next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there are contributions where _ two _ of the final state partons are theoretically unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> the three different double unresolved contributions which occur in this calculation are : the _ triple collinear _ contributions , arising when the photon and the gluon are simultaneously collinear to one of the quarks , the _ soft / collinear _ contributions arising when the photon is collinear to one of the quarks while the gluon is soft and the _ double single collinear </S>",
    "<S> _ contributions , resulting when the photon is collinear to one of the quarks while the gluon is collinear to the other . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there are also single unresolved contributions from the one - loop @xmath49 process and from the tree - level fragmentation process @xmath50 when two of the final state particles are collinear . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed derivation of each of these singular contributions , along with how the different single and double unresolved regions match onto each other , will be presented in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the combination of the unresolved contributions present in the processes shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : class](a)-(d ) yields a result that still contains single and double poles in @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> these pole terms however are proportional to the universal next - to - leading order splitting function @xmath52  @xcite and a convolution of two lowest order splitting functions , @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , they are factorized into the next - to - leading order counterterm of the bare quark - to photon fragmentation function @xcite present in the contribution depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : class](e ) , yielding a finite and factorization scale ( @xmath54 ) dependent result @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> once the singularities have been removed , the remaining finite contributions can be numerically evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> often this is realized within the _ phase space slicing _ method , first introduced by @xcite and further developed in @xcite for general next - to - leading order qcd processes . </S>",
    "<S> the original formulation of the phase space slicing method requires the analytical calculation of an approximated matrix element inside the theoretically unresolved regions , while the full matrix element is evaluated numerically only outside any singular region . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure turns out to be inappropriate where more than one particle is potentially unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> apart from generically double unresolved regions , we find areas in the four parton phase space which belong simultaneously to two different single unresolved regions . </S>",
    "<S> those areas are not treated correctly within the phase space slicing procedure . </S>",
    "<S> a consistent treatment is possible in the _ hybrid subtraction _ </S>",
    "<S> method developed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme attempts to combine the advantages of the phase space slicing procedure with the alternative _ subtraction _ methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parton resolution parameter is used to isolate the poles , but , rather than assuming that the approximated matrix elements are exact , the difference between the full matrix element and its approximation is numerically evaluated in all unresolved regions .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical program finally evaluating the ` photon ' +  1 jet rate at @xmath44 contains four separate contributions . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions are determined according to the number of partons in the final state and the presence or absence of the quark - to - photon fragmentation function . for each final state , </S>",
    "<S> ` photon ' +  1 jet events are selected using a democratic jet clustering algorithm and a given value of the jet resolution parameter @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the `` fragmentation function '' used in the numerical evaluation of the cross section is the sum of the @xmath54-dependent quark - to - photon fragmentation function and a finite contribution from the unresolved photon region . </S>",
    "<S> the four contributions are :    * * 2 partons + photon * this contribution corresponds to the process @xmath56 with a hard photon in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> it is present at @xmath11 and @xmath44 ( due to the presence of a theoretically unresolved real or virtual gluon ) . * * 2 partons + `` fragmentation '' * the @xmath57 process is present at @xmath11 and @xmath44 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it contains the finite terms corresponding to the @xmath58 collinear region at @xmath11 and the finite parts associated with all double unresolved regions at @xmath44 . * * 3 partons + photon * this contribution is only present at @xmath14 and describes the @xmath59 process where both photon and gluon are theoretically resolved . * * 3 partons + `` fragmentation '' * the @xmath60 process with a hard gluon in the final state , is only present at @xmath14 .       </S>",
    "<S> each of the contributions listed above depends logarithmically ( in fact as @xmath61 ) on the theoretical resolution parameter @xmath62 , which is used throughout the calculation to divide the final state phase space into different resolved and unresolved regions . however , the physical ` photon ' + 1  jet cross section , which is the sum of all theoretically resolved and unresolved contributions , _ must _ of course be independent of the choice of @xmath63 . that this is indeed the case </S>",
    "<S> is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ymin2 ] where we show the sum of all @xmath44 contributions to the total rate as a function of @xmath64 . for simplicity , we show only the @xmath44 contribution for a single quark of charge @xmath20 such that @xmath65 , @xmath66 using the durham jet algorithm with @xmath67 , and integrated for @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the cross section approaches ( within numerical errors ) a constant value provided that @xmath63 is chosen to be small enough , indicating a complete cancellation of all powers of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a strong check on the correctness of our results and on the consistency of our approach . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior at large values of @xmath63 can be understood to be due to terms proportional to @xmath69 , which have been neglected in the analytic evaluation of all theoretically unresolved contributions . </S>",
    "<S> it can clearly be seen that these terms are already unimportant at @xmath70 , which will be used in all numerical studies below .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now determine the quark - to - photon fragmentation function @xmath71 up to this order from a comparison between the measured ` photon ' +  1 jet rate @xcite and the results of our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this function , which parameterizes the perturbatively incalculable long - distance contribution to the photon radiation off a quark has to satisfy a perturbative evolution equation in the factorization scale @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> all unknown long - distance contributions can therefore be attributed to the behavior of @xmath72 , the initial value of this fragmentation function , which is to be fitted to the experimental data , at some low scale @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the next - to - leading order fragmentation function can be expressed as an _ exact _ solution of the evolution equation up to @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : dnlo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be re - emphasized that this solution does not take the commonly implemented ( e.g.  @xcite ) resummations of @xmath74 into account . as explained above </S>",
    "<S> , this appears the only consistent procedure since powers of @xmath75 may be of equal importance in the large @xmath12 region  @xcite , which is the main region of interest in the present study . finally , this procedure is identical to the procedure applied in earlier theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite analyses at lowest order , such that a direct and self - consistent quantification of the next - to - leading order effects in the ` photon ' +  1 jet rate becomes feasible .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since this solution is exact at the order under consideration , the factorization scale dependence of the ` photon ' +  1 jet rate is eliminated , i.e.  our results are independent of the choice of @xmath18 .          </S>",
    "<S> a three parameter fit to the aleph ` photon ' +  1 jet data @xcite for the @xmath12 distribution , @xmath76 , for the jet resolution parameter @xmath77 and @xmath78 is chosen so that the observed hadronic cross section is reproduced by the @xmath79 calculation . </S>",

    "<S> is introduced to ensure that the predicted @xmath12 distribution is well behaved as @xmath24 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be kept in mind that both parameterizations are only fitted to data with @xmath10 , which is thus the natural limit of their validity .    </S>",
    "<S> the aleph data and the results of the @xmath14 calculation using the fitted next - to - leading order fragmentation function are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y006 ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( for reference , we have also displayed the @xmath11 prediction  @xcite using the aleph fit of the lowest order fragmentation function  @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> the fit also provides a good description of the @xmath12 distribution for other values of @xmath85 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected since the non - perturbative effects are largely in the collinear core of the ` photon ' jet which is fully contained within the jet definition . moreover , it turns out that the next - to - leading order corrections are moderate for all values of @xmath85 , which clearly demonstrates the perturbative stability of our fixed order approach .    the resulting next - to - leading order ( @xmath86 ) quark - to - photon fragmentation function ( for a quark of unit charge ) at a factorization scale @xmath87 is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> is observed only for @xmath12 close to 1 , indicating the presence of large @xmath75 .       </S>",
    "<S> having described the @xmath12 distribution in the measured range , we shall now focus only on the ` photon ' +  1 jet rate for @xmath88 which can be viewed as the _ isolated _ photon +  1 jet rate in the democratic clustering approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this division between isolated and non - isolated is motivated both by the measured @xmath12 distribution ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : y006 ] ) and the observation that hadronization effects cause the photon jet to have a @xmath12 value slightly less than unity @xcite . in previous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite analyses of isolated photon +  @xmath89 jet rates , </S>",
    "<S> the candidate photon was isolated from the other hadrons using a geometrical cone , _ before _ these hadrons were clustered into jets by the jet recombination algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the photon was said to be ` isolated ' if it was accompanied only by a small ( but non - zero ) amount of hadronic energy inside the cone . as a result of these analyses </S>",
    "<S> it was found that large negative next - to - leading order corrections were needed to obtain a reasonable agreement between theory and experiment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a lowest order calculation of the photon +  1 jet rate for the cone algorithm using the process independent photon fragmentation function measured by aleph @xcite and a suitable choice of @xmath12 to define the isolation yields good agreement with the data @xcite .    using the results of our calculation and the fitted quark - to - photon fragmentation function , </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the isolated photon +  1 jet rate in the democratic approach up to @xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : ycut ] . </S>",
    "<S> it can clearly be seen that inclusion of the next - to - leading order corrections improves the agreement between data and theory over the whole range of @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also apparent that the next - to - leading order corrections to the isolated photon +  1 jet rate obtained in this democratic clustering approach are of reasonable size indicating a better perturbative stability of this _ isolated _ photon definition .       as a final illustration of the generality of our results </S>",
    "<S> , we turn to the inclusive photon distribution recently measured by the opal collaboration @xcite . here , jets are not defined and , rather than the distribution of electromagnetic energy within the cluster , the energy distribution of the photon is considered . </S>",

    "<S> they find reasonable agreement with factorization scales @xmath90 , although the data is too poor to discriminate between the models . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : inclusive ] shows our ( scale independent ) predictions for the inclusive photon energy distribution at both leading and next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> we see good agreement with the data , even though the phase space relevant for the opal data far exceeds that used to determine the fragmentation functions from the aleph photon + 1 jet data .    in summary </S>",

    "<S> although only next - to - leading order in perturbation theory , this calculation contains several ingredients appropriate to the calculation of jet observables at next - to - next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we needed to generalize the phase space slicing method of  @xcite to more than one theoretically unresolved particle and have analytically calculated the following double unresolved configurations  @xcite : the triple collinear factor , the soft / collinear factor and the double single collinear factor . </S>",
    "<S> the ` photon ' +  1 jet rate was then evaluated for a democratic clustering algorithm with a monte carlo program using the hybrid subtraction method of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our calculation , when compared to the data  @xcite on the ` photon ' +  1 jet rate obtained by aleph , enabled a first determination of the process independent quark - to - photon fragmentation function at @xmath44 in a fixed order approach . </S>",
    "<S> as a first application , we have used this function to calculate the ` isolated ' photon +  1 jet rate in a democratic clustering approach at next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the qcd corrections improves the agreement between theoretical prediction and experimental data . </S>",
