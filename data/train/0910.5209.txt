    "using strain in thin films to achieve expanded or contracted lattices of novel materials has proven fruitful in producing new phases or functionalities for known bulk compounds .",
    "an interesting avenue of investigation is the growth of anisotropically strained films of perovskite oxides .",
    "the heavily hole - doped perovskite manganites that order in the c - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) arrangement,@xcite e.g. nd@xmath11sr@xmath12mno@xmath3 with @xmath13 , are of interest in this regard .",
    "single crystals of compounds with @xmath14 have not been successfully grown to our knowledge .",
    "the c - type af state consists of a one - dimensional ordering of @xmath15 orbitals of the mn@xmath16 sites oriented along the elongated @xmath5 axis of the tetragonal structure , facilitating ferromagnetic ( fm ) coupling of mn@xmath16 and mn@xmath17 spins along @xmath5 and an af spin alignment along the @xmath0 axes.@xcite @xmath0-axis oriented films under anisotropic strain should allow for the manipulation of the fm double - exchange and af superexchange interactions responsible for this ordering.@xcite they should make accessible the study of intrinsic electrical anisotropy , a motivation for which is the large static dielectric constant ( @xmath18 ) observed@xcite in polycrystalline ca@xmath1la@xmath2mno@xmath3 , and hypothesized to arise from an enhanced polarizability along the one - dimensional @xmath5-axis in the af phase .",
    "relevant to the successful growth of @xmath0-axis films of these compounds are thermal expansion coefficients along the @xmath0 and @xmath5 axes that are opposite in sign in a broad temperature range from the cubic - tetragonal transition to well below room temperature ( a consequence of the orbital ordering).@xcite this differential thermal expansion induces highly anisotropic and temperature - dependent in - plane strain .",
    "we find that thicker films under anisotropic tensile strain within the substrate plane develop uniaxial crack arrays with regular crack spacing on the order of 1 @xmath19 m .",
    "these crack arrays yield in - plane electrical resistivities that are highly anisotropic with an anisotropy ratio that varies approximately exponentially with film thickness , reaching values @xmath20 .",
    "the nel temperatures of films under tensile strain are enhanced by 25  k , independent of thickness , over those of the bulk target and compressively strained films , consistent with an increased stability of the orbital and spin order that is controlled principally by the @xmath5-axis length .",
    "the polycrystalline target of nominal composition nd@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 ( nsmo ) was prepared by conventional solid state reaction as described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite thin films were grown by pulsed laser deposition on pseudocubic ( 110)-oriented ( laalo@xmath3)@xmath21-(sr@xmath22altao@xmath23)@xmath24 ( lsat ; @xmath25  nm ) and laalo@xmath3 ( lao ; @xmath26  nm ) , and orthorhombic ( 100)-oriented ndgao@xmath3 ( ngo ; @xmath27  nm , @xmath28  nm , @xmath29  nm ) substrates . an excimer laser ( krf:@xmath30  nm ) with a frequency of 10  hz and and an energy density @xmath311 - 2  j/@xmath32 were employed .",
    "the substrate temperature was @xmath33c and partial oxygen pressure 260  mtorr .",
    "following deposition , films were cooled in @xmath34 torr o@xmath22 at @xmath35c / min . to @xmath36c and held for 1 hour before cooling to room temperature . the crystallographic orientation , film thickness  ( @xmath37 ) and lattice constants were evaluated using a philips xpert x - ray diffractometer ( cu k@xmath38 radiation ) .",
    "surface morphology was studied with scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) .",
    "four - probe , in - plane dc resistivity ( with silver epoxy contacts ) was measured on specimens with typical dimensions @xmath39",
    "the room - temperature thermopower was measured for all specimens with a steady - state method using gold leads and a chromel - constantan thermocouple .",
    "the target lattice constants , @xmath41  nm , @xmath42  nm are in reasonable agreement with those reported by kajimoto _",
    "et al._@xcite for crushed , melt - grown crystals at lower doping .",
    "the value of the nel temperature , @xmath43  k was inferred from the peak in @xmath44 ( further discussed below ) .",
    "all of the films are orthorhombic with their longer @xmath5 axes in the film plane . taking the @xmath0 axis in the growth direction ,",
    "the ( 100 ) orientation of the films is indicated in x - ray diffraction @xmath45-@xmath46 scans , shown for 130 nm - thick films grown on lsat ( 110 ) and lao ( 110 ) in fig .",
    "[ xrd ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , by the presence of only @xmath47 film reflections near the @xmath48 substrate reflections .",

    "x - ray results for the films on ngo indicate nsmo [ 010]@xmath49ngo [ 010 ] and nsmo [ 001]@xmath49ngo [ 001 ] .",
    "the lattice constants for all films were determined from reciprocal space maps in the vicinity of the the film ( 600 ) , ( 440 ) , ( 620 ) , and ( 404 ) reflections , with nearby substrate reflections serving as internal references .",
    "the corresponding ngo reflections have the same indices as the films . for ( 110)-oriented lao and lsat the corresponding substrate reflections are ( 330 ) , ( 400 ) , ( 420 ) , and ( 222 ) , respectively .",
    "figure  [ latticeconstants ] shows lattice constants as a function of film thickness for films on the three substrates . for all substrates and thicknesses ,",
    "the film @xmath5-axes are fully strained to those of the substrate .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath6 axis lengths are clearly relaxed in response to the compressive ( lao ) and tensile ( lsat , ngo ) in - plane strain along the film [ 010 ] directions , with the most substantial effect occurring for ngo .    for lao films",
    "the result is an expansion along [ 010 ] and contraction along the film normal ( [ 100 ] ) , whereas for ngo films the @xmath6-axes contract and the @xmath0-axes expand . for both substrates",
    "the thickest film is tetragonal .",
    "the films on lsat exhibit more modest contractions along both [ 010 ] and [ 100 ] with increasing thickness , maintaining tetragonality . in spite of these differences in behavior for the ngo and lsat films under tensile strain ,",
    "their unit cell volumes ( fig .  [ cellvolume ] ) show very similar decreases with increasing thickness .    scanning electron micrographs ( fig .",
    "[ sem ] ) demonstrate that the relaxation of tensile strain along [ 010 ] for the films on ngo and lsat is accommodated by the formation of unidirectional crack arrays running along the film [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the spacing of these cracks , determined from analyses of larger - area images from films on each of the substrates , approximately describes a log - normal distribution ( shown in fig .",
    "[ sem ]  ( c)for the 65-nm ngo film ) , with median values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 for lsat and ngo films , respectively .",
    "these distributions did not change appreciably with thickness for either substrate .",
    "the width of the cracks themselves varies within a given film ( particularly evident in fig .",
    "[ sem ] ( a ) for the ngo film ) , and the mean crack width is greater in the thicker films . though transverse - sectional microscopy was not pursued , as we discuss further below the transport data",
    "implies that the cracks do not penetrate through to the substrate .",
    "similar crack arrays were observed previously@xcite for [ 110]-oriented yba@xmath22cu@xmath3o@xmath53 and prba@xmath22cu@xmath3o@xmath53 films grown on [ 110 ] srtio@xmath3 , where they were attributed to anisotropic thermal expansion mismatch between substrate and film upon cooling from the growth temperature .",
    "the same mechanism appears applicable to the present oxide film - substrate systems since , as noted above , nsmo has thermal expansion coefficients of opposite sign : positive along [ 010 ] and negative along [ 001 ] .",
    "the lattice mismatch , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the substrate and bulk target lattice constants , respectively ) is shown as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "[ misfit ] along the [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] film directions for each of the three substrates .",
    "these curves were computed using published thermal expansion data for the substrates.@xcite the target lattice constants were measured up to 200@xmath57c and their temperature dependencies found to match well those of tobe _ et al . _ ( ref .  )",
    "measured over a broader temperature range for compounds with a slightly different stoichiometry ; the target data were then extended to higher temperature using the suitably scaled expansion data .    at the growth temperature ( 750@xmath57c )",
    "the tensile mismatch for lsat and ngo is greatest along the film [ 001 ] direction . upon cooling ,",
    "the mismatch along [ 001 ] decreases since the c - axis expands , while that along [ 010 ] increases . for the films on ngo the [ 010 ] mismatch approaches 2% at room temperature , the same amount by which the @xmath6-axis lattice parameter decreases abruptly with increasing thickness .",
    "although the calculated compressive mismatch along [ 010 ] for films on lao is only 0.5% at room temperature , the compressed lattice is only stable at low thicknesses .",
    "evidently there is a comparable critical thickness for nsmo above which both compressed and expanded lattices are relaxed .    in spite of the linear crack arrays that develop in the thicker films under tensile strain , all of the films remain smooth as indicated by well - defined kiessig oscillations seen in x - ray reflectivity measurements over an extended angular range ( fig .",
    "[ xrr ] ) .",
    "reflectivity simulations@xcite imply a film surface roughness with variance @xmath58 nm for the thinnest films , comparable to the perovskite unit cell dimension , with a modest increase for thicker films .",
    "the dc electrical resistivity was measured for each film along the [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] directions as a function of temperature for @xmath59  k. film resistances exceeding 1 g@xmath60 prevented measurements below @xmath61  k. the room - temperature resistivity anisotropy , @xmath8 , is found to increase approximately exponentially with increasing film thickness for the lsat and ngo films ( fig .",
    "[ rvsthickness ] ) , reflecting principally an increase along [ 010 ] due to cracking .",
    "for the thickest films @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding ratio for the lao films also increases with thickness , reaching @xmath63 for the 150-nm film . as",
    "this thickest film is tetragonal with unit cell volume and @xmath64 closest to the bulk target ( fig .",
    "[ latticeconstants ] ) , we take the latter value to be representative of the intrinsic anisotropy of the nsmo compound .    to investigate the possibility that variations in oxygen content with thickness might contribute to the changes in resistivity , the room - temperature thermopower ( tep ) was measured for all films .",
    "the tep is a sensitive measure of mn valence that is largely independent of cation in this region of the manganite phase diagram@xcite .",
    "the value measured for the target was @xmath65 .",
    "the thermopowers for the films did not vary by more than @xmath66 for all thicknesses , typically falling in the range @xmath67 , as shown for the ngo films in the inset of fig .",
    "[ rvsthickness ] .",
    "thus significant and systematic variations in the oxygen content of the films with thickness are ruled out .",
    "[ nsmorhovst ] shows the @xmath68 dependence of the in - plane resistivities for the 67-nm film grown on ( 110 ) lsat along with that of the target .",
    "interestingly , in spite of the substantial resistive anisotropy ( @xmath69 for this film ) , the @xmath68 dependencies are essentially identical along the [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] directions ( inset , fig .  [ nsmorhovst ] ) .",
    "this implies that the cracks do not penetrate into the substrate , since a stronger temperature dependence would be expected associated with thermally activated tunnel conduction as observed in other cracked manganite films.@xcite    the antiferromagnetic transition temperatures , @xmath64 , determined from maxima in @xmath70 _ vs. _ @xmath68 ( inset , fig .  [ nsmorhovst ] ) , are @xmath71  k for lsat and ngo films , and @xmath72  k , the same as the bulk target , for films grown on lao . in g - type af s like ca@xmath73sr@xmath74mno@xmath3 ,",
    "expansion of the lattice due to sr substitution@xcite enhances af superexchange interactions ( and @xmath64 ) due to an increase in the mn - o - mn bond angle .",
    "stability of the c - type af ordered state is increased by structural modifications tending to isolate the fm one - dimensional chains.@xcite in the present films it seems likely that the significant enhancement of @xmath64 for films with expanded unit cells is principally due to the expansion along [ 001 ] .",
    "though enhanced superexchange , e.g. due to an increase in the mn - o - mn bond angles along [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] is possible , the observation that @xmath64 for these films is independent of thickness , in spite of the very different @xmath6-axis lengths due to cracking in the thicker films , argues against its prominent role in determining the increase in @xmath64 .",
    "more likely is that the expansion along [ 001 ] actually enhances the double - exchange coupling along [ 001 ] in this compound , thereby increasing the stability of the orbital and c - type nel ordering.@xcite we note that the @xmath5-axis length in the bulk target is @xmath75  % smaller than that of a @xmath76 compound@xcite with @xmath77  k. thus the observed increase in @xmath64 for the films under tension is consistent with existing data on the structure and phase behavior in this regime of composition , where @xmath64 is plausibly controlled principally by the @xmath5-axis length .",
    "epitaxial @xmath0-axis - oriented films of nd@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 have been grown under both compressive and tensile strain .",
    "the intrinsic resistivity anisotropy of the material , inferred from transport measurements on a 150-nm thick , compressively strained film , is @xmath78 .",
    "uniaxial crack arrays oriented along the film [ 001 ] direction develop in films under tensile strain with thickness @xmath79 due to anisotropic thermal expansion mismatch upon cooling from the growth temperature .",
    "typical crack spacings are a few @xmath80 . the resistivity anisotropy measured for the cracked films exceeds @xmath81 .",
    "identical temperature dependencies of the resistivity along and transverse to the cracks implies that not all penetrate through to the substrate , and thus the large anisotropy is attributed to a thin and meandering conduction path for transport along [ 010 ] .",
    "the increased nel temperature for films under tensile strain , from 240  k for the bulk target to 265  k independent of thickness , suggests that enhanced fm exchange stabilizes the orbital and spin order of the c - type af state , and that their stability in this region of the phase diagram is largely controlled by the @xmath5-axis length .",
