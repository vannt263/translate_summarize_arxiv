    "as it is well known , the ising model@xcite is amenable of an exact solution on simple two dimensional lattices @xcite , whereas for more complex lattices or higher dimensions the study of its thermodynamic properties strongly relies on numeric simulations .",
    "according to the so - called _ dynamic monte carlo method _ , the thermodynamic canonical average of a generic observable @xmath10 is obtained as a simple algebraic average over the markov chain of configurations produced by a suitable stochastic algorithm @xcite .",

    "one of the most commonly exploited algorithms is the glauber s single - spin - flip algorithm @xcite . according to glauber s prescription two subsequent configurations",

    "( [ e : gp ] ) together with a prescription for updating the spin system . the latter is commonly chosen in view of a computational optimization and typically consists in an unphysical sweep along parallel lattice lines@xcite .    as we mentioned above such a dynamics has a computational rather than physical origin , having been devised as an efficient way to give estimates of the canonical averages .",
    "nevertheless it is usually given a physical interpretation @xcite : the energy variation consequent to the spin - flips realizing the evolution of the system occur due to the coupling of the spin degrees of freedom to a heat - bath at temperature @xmath13 .",
    "in the last decade a number of new dynamics for the ising model were introduced@xcite , where the energy variations are typically required to occur uniformly throughout the whole sample .    here",
    "we introduce an alternative dynamics exhibiting the diffusive behaviour of a random walk in an evolving landscape generated by the energy of the spin couplings in the real space .",
    "the spin - flips are induced by a random walker hopping across the sites of the underlying discrete structure .",
    "the motion of such a random walker is affected by the spin interaction , being biased towards those sites where a spin - flip is energetically more favorable .",
    "it should be remarked that a relaxation dynamics occurring under the action of random walkers was introduced by creutz@xcite , and subsequently exploited by many authors .",
    "however our walkers act quite differently from creutz s _ demons_. indeed the latter diffuse freely , unbiased by the magnetic configuration of the system , and , in order to simulate the micro - canonical ensemble , they induce a spin flip only if they can afford it , according to the individual energy they are endowed with .    in fact our model in inspired by the physical behaviour of manganites @xcite , such as @xmath18 , where the spin dynamics is determined by the presence of diffusing excitations interacting with the magnetic degrees of freedom . in particular , for the manganites",
    "the excitations are given by the charged carriers , electrons and vacancies , present in the non - stoichiometrical compounds .",
    "obviously , this model is not intended to be a phenomenological description of such complex systems , but it aims to evidence the influence of diffusing excitation interacting with spins on the thermodynamic behaviour of the paradigmatic model of all magnetic phase transitions .",
    "the analysis of the diffusive dynamics is carried out from the numerical point of view .",
    "all the simulations illustrated in the present paper refer to two - dimensional arrays of spins , so that the observed features of the statistical model can be compared to the analytically known results pertaining to the canonical ising model .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ s : dd ] we describe and briefly discuss the diffusive algorithm .",
    "section [ s : nces ] and [ s : cb ] are devoted to the analysis of the limit situation where the dynamics is realized by a single walker . in the former we provide numerical evidences that the magnetic system is driven to a thermodynamically well - behaved steady state which differs from the canonical equilibrium state in a non trivial - manner .",
    "since a magnetic phase transition is still observed , the consequent critical behaviour is analyzed in section [ s : cb ] .",
    "the estimated critical exponents do not deviate significantly from the values pertaining to the canonical ising model . in section [ s : de ]",
    "the results of simulations where the system evolves subject to more than a single walker are analyzed .",
    "section [ s : cp ] consists in our conclusions .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section the relaxation dynamics we propose is realized by means of random walkers diffusing through the sites of the ising system . the probability that a walker located at site @xmath2 hops on site @xmath3 and flips the relevant spin , where @xmath3 is one of the @xmath19 neighbours of @xmath2 ,",
    "is given by @xmath20 hence , for any configuration @xmath21 of the ising system and for any value of the temperature @xmath13 , the diffusion of the walker is biased towards those sites where a spin - flip is more likely to occur according to glauber s probability , eq .",
    "( [ e : gp ] ) .",
    "note that equation ( [ e : pij ] ) implicitly yields a probability @xmath22 that the walker does not move .",
    "if this is the case the magnetic configuration of the system @xmath21 remains unchanged as well . according to equations ( [ e : pij ] ) and ( [ e : pii ] ) the evolution of the probability @xmath23 that , at time step @xmath24 , the magnetic system is in the configuration @xmath21 while the walker is located at site @xmath2 , is governed by the master equation @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a shorthand notation for the configuration obtained flipping the spin @xmath27 of @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately the master equation approach is of very little use in analyzing the long - time behaviour of this process .",
    "actually in the canonical heat - bath case the master equation was exploited to build a dynamics driving the system to a known asymptotic probability .",
    "this was obtained by imposing the quite restrictive _ detailed balance condition_. conversely , we introduced an evolution algorithm and our aim is the study of the resulting asymptotic state of the ising system , if any .",
    "hence we carry out our analysis mainly by means of numerical simulations . for a better comparison we focus on the two - dimensional system , where most of the results pertaining to the canonical ising model are exactly known .",
    "hence all of our simulations refer to an ising system consisting of @xmath28 spins placed at the sites of a two - dimensional square lattice . in order to avoid time consuming procedures dealing with the walkers bumping into the borders of the system we adopt periodic boundary conditions .    in the next two sections we focus on the situation where the evolution of the ising system is realized by a single walker .",
    "this is a limit case , in that , for a reasonably macroscopic system , it corresponds to a vanishing density of walkers .",
    "the results pertaining to larger densities are discussed in section [ s : de ] .",
    "in the following we give numerical evidence that the spin - flip dynamics realized by a single walker drives the magnetic system to a thermodynamically well - behaved steady state which differs from the canonical equilibrium state in a non trivial manner .     at @xmath29 .",

    "we verified that the long time behaviour of the macroscopic observables of the system is uniquely determined by the only external parameter characterizing the dynamics , namely the temperature @xmath13 .",
    "in particular different choices for the initial configuration of the magnetic system do not affect the asymptotic behaviour of the system , except for a possible trivial bias on the orientation of the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "similar to what happens in the heat - bath case , both of the possible orientation of the specific magnetization are in principle equally likely , but a strongly magnetized initial configuration is very likely to evolve in a stationary state exhibiting a spontaneous magnetization along the same direction . when the initial configuration has no net magnetization there is no bias on the direction of the spontaneous magnetization exhibited by the system below the critical temperature . in this situations the formation of macroscopic domains exhibiting opposite net magnetization is observed ( see fig.[f : domains ] ) . in the long time regime one of the domains eventually prevails against the others .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as we already mentioned the system exhibits a magnetic phase transition . from fig .",
    "[ f : spmag ] and [ f : domains ] , it is clear that the critical temperature for the diffusive dynamics is significantly larger than the value pertaining to the canonical ising model . such value , @xmath37 is analytically known and the heat - bath dynamics yield quite satisfactory numerical estimates of it . as we will see in the next section ,",
    "accurate estimates yield the value @xmath38 for the critical temperature of an ising system evolving under the action of a single walker .",
    "however , such a quantitative difference can not be accounted for by means of a simple rescaling of the temperature .",
    "indeed if the diffusive dynamics acted as heat - bath dynamics with a rescaled temperature , @xmath39 , the generic configuration @xmath12 would occur with a probability @xmath40 $ ] in the asymptotic regime @xcite .",

    "this can be verified with great precision in the case of the heat - bath dynamics @xcite the numeric estimates of these curves for two different values of the specific energy @xmath49 are plotted in figures [ f : dos1 ] and [ f : dos2 ] .     for a @xmath50 ising array subject to the diffusive dynamics .",

    "asymptotically reached by an ising system subject to the action of the diffusive dynamics is thermodynamically well - behaved , and yet it is non - trivially different from the canonical equilibrium of the ising model .",

    "this suggests that the relevant temperatures , @xmath102 is not sufficiently close to the critical value .",
    "moreover it should be recalled that the finite size of the system can introduce appreciable deviations from the theoretical prediction , which is strictly true in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "nevertheless we mention that a function of the form @xmath103 fits the data quite satisfactorily over a wide range of distances .",

    "a fit of the same kind satisfactorily applies to the data relevant to the temperature @xmath100 , and it gives a critical exponent @xmath106 once again in good agreement with the canonical value .",
    "these results could be an indication of the fact that , in the suitable regime , the correlation function @xmath107 actually exhibits a power law behaviour characterized by the same critical exponent as the two - dimensional canonical ising model .",
    "the results illustrated so far suggest that a two - dimensional ising ferromagnet subject to the diffusive dynamics exhibits a critical behaviour belonging to the same universality class as the canonical case .    before concluding the present section we mention a further result which has no counterpart in the canonical case . indeed , in the diffusive case , it is possible to relate the configuration of the magnetic system to the position of the random walker causing its evolution .",
    "more precisely it is possible to measure to what extent the presence of the random walker at a given site @xmath2 and the local magnetization at a given site @xmath3 influence each other .",
    "numerical estimates of such correlation , which we illustrate elsewhere @xcite , show that it exhibits a critical behaviour in correspondence of the critical temperature .",
    "the results illustrated in the previous two sections refer to the case of an ising system subject to the action of a single walker . here",
    "we analyze the results of simulations where the evolution of a square ising array consisting of @xmath0 spins is realized by @xmath108 non interacting walkers .",
    "the simulation is initialized giving each walker a randomly chosen position .",
    "two or more walkers are allowed to occupy the same site of the system .",
    "actually this is very likely to happen for a sufficiently large density of walkers @xmath109 .",
    "an elementary step of the simulation consists in the application of the algorithm described in section [ s : dd ] to all of the walkers , according to a fixed progressive sequence .",
    "when its turn comes , a given walker acts as if the other ones were not present .",
    "a qualitative argument leads us to expect that in the case of an infinite density of walkers the results pertaining to the canonical ising model are recovered .",
    "consider a very large density of walkers , such that @xmath110 .",
    "in this situation the effect of a single step of the simulation is very similar to the action of the glauber s dynamics with a random sequence update .",
    "indeed the probability that a walker flips a given spin @xmath5 is given by the product of the probability @xmath111 that it is located at one of the four neighbours of site @xmath2 times the hopping probability , @xmath112 .",
    "but @xmath113 is exactly the probability that the spin @xmath5 is flipped at any step of the glauber s heat - bath dynamics with random site update .",
    "hence , in the limit case of an infinite density of walkers , the diffusive dynamics should necessarily drive the system to the same asymptotic state as the heat - bath dynamics , thus reproducing the results of the canonical ising model .",
    "the same should be clearly true for a sufficiently large density of walkers , provided that the consequent number of elementary steps of the heat - bath dynamics drive the system sufficiently close to the canonical equilibrium state .",

    "more generally we verified that the average value of a macroscopic observable relevant to a finite density lies within the interval between the values pertaining to the limit situations , namely the vanishing density limit @xmath117 analyzed in sections [ s : nces ] and [ s : cb ] , and the canonical ising model .",
    "the influence of the density of walkers is synthesized in figure [ f : ntc ] , where the estimated values of the critical temperature are plotted .",
    "note that the larger variation occurs for densities between @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "in this paper we exploited the basic microscopic model of diffusion , namely the random walk , to build a dynamics for the ising ferromagnet which retains the diffusive character of the thermal motion of a localized excitation . in this framework",
    "the density of walkers is related both to the intensity and spatial extent of the coupling of the spins to the thermal degrees of freedom of the system , and hence to the velocity of the thermal dynamics .",
    "the larger is the density of walkers , the faster is the dynamics and the closer to the uniform heath - bath are its effects .",
    "even if our model is rather simplified with respect to the real physical systems which inspired it , it exhibits new important qualitative features which should be relevant even in more complex and realistic situations",
    ". therefore it would be of great interest to verify whether the diffusive thermal dynamics gives a satisfactory description for the slow evolution of a magnetic system with hopping excitations .",
    "this would of course require the extension of the study of its effect on the more realistic three dimensional lattice . in view of recognizing the action of a diffusive dynamics in a real system",
    ", the results of section [ s : cb ] suggest that the study of the critical behaviour is not particularly significant .",
    "indeed the latter does not allow to discriminate among the canonical and the diffusive dynamics .",
    "on the other hand the results illustrated in section [ s : de ] indicate that the velocity of the non - equilibrium dynamics ( related to the degree of coupling of the spins to the thermal vibrations , i.e. to the density of excitations induced in the system by an external source ) significantly affects the critical temperature of the system .",
    "hence the same system subject to diffusive thermal dynamics with different velocity should display different critical temperatures .",
    "furthermore we remark that fig .",
    "[ f : domains ] suggests that the velocity of the dynamics influences the shape and growth of the macroscopic magnetic domains .",
    "in particular a very slow diffusive dynamics gives rise to domains with smoother boundaries .",
    "this feature suggests that the final shape of the magnetic domains within a physical system possibly governed by a diffusive thermal dynamics could be controlled by a fine tuning of the density of excitations mediating the coupling to the thermal degrees of freedom",
