    "gauge theories provide a successful framework to unify the strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions in nature . the recent introduction of the ashtekar variables in general relativity has permitted to reformulate the gravitational interaction in the form of a standard gauge theory , plus additional constraints .",
    "gauge theories where no matter is included , are fully described in terms of a single field : the connection @xmath2 , which is the non - abelian generalization of the standard electromagnetic potentials . in general ,",
    "gauge theories are characterized by being invariant under transformations generated by local symmetries , i.e. transformations of the connection which may be differently chosen at each point in space time .",
    "this freedom has the consequence of introducing arbitrary functions in the dynamics of the connection . in this way",
    ", only those specific fields constructed from the connection which are independent of these arbitrary functions , will be of physical relevance : they are called gauge invariant objects . from this point of view",
    "one could say that taking @xmath2 as the basic field in a gauge theory is an unnecessary complication .",
    "this observation has prompted many proposals to describe gauge theories starting _ ab initio _ with only gauge invariant objects .    in this contribution we will consider the so called loop representation approach , to be described with more detail in the sequel .",
    "this method has been very successful in the description of non - perturbative aspects of gauge theories and also in providing spectacular advancements in the problem of quantizing einstein gravity .",
    "the basic underlying idea of the loop representation is that the hilbert space of gauge invariant states can be spanned by states which are labeled by loops .",
    "a main feature of the loop approach is the redundancy of the gauge invariant degrees of freedom : they constitute an overcomplete set which is restricted by the so called mandelstam identities .",
    "these identities must be taken into account , either by imposing them over the physical states in a manner similar to the standard dirac constraints , or by explicitly solving them in order to identify the corresponding reduced phase space .",
    "even the preliminary problem of identifying the complete set of mandelstam identities for a given physical situation is not completely solved in the general case for gauge theories over a lie algebra .    in this work",
    "we will discuss only theories described by a connection field , i.e. those where matter fields are absent .",
    "these include pure yang mills theories , pure @xmath1 dimensional chern simons theories and also gravity and supergravity in the ashtekar formulation , for example . from the hamiltonian point of view , these theories are basically on the same footing .",
    "each one is characterized by a specific canonical hamiltonian together with a given set of first - class constraints .",
    "we will be mostly concerned with the elucidation of the problem of the mandelstam identities , both in the standard case and also when the connection of the gauge theory is defined over a super lie algebra . besides its own interest , the latter situation is also relevant as a first step in the application of loop representation methods to fully supersymmetric gauge theories , which involve matter fields as well .",
    "the discussion will be focused at the classical level , without considering in detail the construction of quantum states as functionals of loops .",
    "these notes do not have the pretense whatsoever of being a review on the subject and from the very beginning we apologize to those authors whose work we have involuntarily not cited .",
    "the general organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we provide a brief review of the standard formulation of yang mills theories in terms of the connection .",
    "we recall the lagrangian formulation as well as the hamiltonian approach , in which the loop representation is based .",
    "section 3 contains the basic material necessary to extend the connection to a super lie algebra object and includes the definition of a supermatrix together with those of the fundamental invariants under similarity transformations : the supertrace and the superdeterminant .",
    "an introduction to the loop space formulation of gauge theories is presented in section 4 , where the basic concepts are reviewed to end up with the introduction of the gauge invariant degrees of freedom : the wilson loops . also , the construction of the wave functionals of the system in the loop space is briefly sketched .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the overcompleteness of the loop space variables and the mandelstam identities are introduced to account for this redundancy , both in the classical and quantum case .",
    "the so called generic mandelstam identities are subsequently derived from the identities arising from the application of the cayley - hamilton theorem in the specific representation where the connection lives .",
    "section 6 deals with the extension of the previous ideas to the case where the connection is defined over a graded lie algebra . to begin with",
    ", we present an extension of the cayley - hamilton theorem to the case of supermatrices . besides its own interest , our motivation to deal with this mathematical problem is the claim that the algorithm developed for the standard case in section 5 can be extended to this situation , thus providing the corresponding mandelstam identities .",
    "the extension of the cayley - hamilton theorem proceeds in two steps : ( i ) the identification and definition of a characteristic polynomial for supermatrices and ( ii ) the proof that each supermatrix annihilates the null polynomial previously defined .",
    "also , examples of characteristic polynomials for supermatrices are given in some simple cases .",
    "finally , examples of mandelstam identities constructed for some simple supermatrices , according to the previous ideas , are presented .",
    "we close with section 7 , which contains some conclusions and a brief outlook of some remaining open problems related to the topics discussed in this paper .",
    "let us consider the yang mills theory corresponding to the compact group @xmath3 , which is characterized by its lie algebra @xmath4 having the antihermitian generators @xmath5 .",
    "they satisfy the commutation relations @xmath6= f^{ab}{}_c \\ t^c$ ] , where @xmath7 are the structure constants of the group .",
    "a standard representation of these generators is in terms of ordinary matrices , with additional restrictions appropriate to the group under consideration .",

    "the above expression reads @xmath18    the object which is covariant under the local group of transformations is the field strength @xmath19 defined by @xmath20 , \\label{fmunu}\\ ] ] which generalizes the electromagnetic field of electrodynamics . under gauge rotations",

    "let us emphasize the basic property that the covariant derivative ( [ covder ] ) of any covariant object is itself a covariant object .",
    "the dynamics of the pure yang mills is described by the action @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the lagrangian density and @xmath26 is an invariant symmetrical tensor in the corresponding representation of the lie algebra . for a semisimple group ( i.e. one having no @xmath27 invariant subgroups ) it is possible to choose @xmath28 .",
    "the world indices are raised and lowered by the minskowsky metric @xmath29 .",
    "the action ( [ covact ] ) is invariant under the gauge transformations ( [ delcon ] ) .",
    "finally , the resulting equations of motion are @xmath30      this formulation corresponds to the @xmath31 splitting of minkowsky space - time , where we select three - dimensional hypersurfaces of constant time .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the chromoelectric , @xmath32 , and chromomagnetic , @xmath33 , fields in the following way @xmath34 here , @xmath35 labels the components of a vector living on the three - dimensional hypersurface and the dot denotes the time derivative evaluated on that hypersurface .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath36 corresponds to the definition ( [ covder ] ) restricted again to the hypersurface , through the conecction @xmath37 . introducing the canonical momenta @xmath38 and defining the hamiltonian density @xmath39",
    ", we obtain the action @xmath40 where @xmath41 and analogously for @xmath42 .",
    "the above expression arises after an additional integration by parts , which can be performed in virtue of the following properties of the covariant derivative : ( i )  @xmath43 and ( ii )   @xmath44 .",
    "the action ( [ hamac ] ) tells us that the phase space variables are the coordinates @xmath45 , together with their conjugated momenta @xmath46 , which satisfy the standard poisson brackets @xmath47 at equal times . also , we infer from ( [ hamac ] ) that @xmath48 are lagrange multipliers leading to the gauss law constraints @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is such that @xmath51 .",
    "in particular @xmath52    applying the standard dirac method for constrained systems @xcite , we can verify that there are no secondary constraints .",
    "also , one obtains that @xmath53 are first - class constraints , which generate gauge transformations on the three - dimensional hypersurface . a compact way to show these properties is by introducing the averaged constraints @xmath54 where @xmath55 are arbitrary functions of position . in this way",
    ", the poisson brackets of the constraints turn out to be @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the group indices are lowered and raised with the metric @xmath58 together with its inverse @xmath59 .",
    "the fact that the constraints @xmath60 generate gauge transformations can be seen from the following calculation @xmath61 which reproduces the spatial part of the transformation ( [ delcon ] ) .",

    "the canonical quantization of the hamiltonian version of a gauge theory follows the standard steps :    ( i )  the canonical variables are promoted to the range of hermitian operators : @xmath62 ,   @xmath63 .",
    "( ii )  the poisson brackets algebra is turned into a commutator ( anticommutator ) algebra , according to the statistic of the involved fields . in our case",

    "the basic functional derivative is defined by @xmath67    ( iv )  the realization of the quantum operators may lead to ordering problems .",
    "in particular , the first - class constraints @xmath68 must be realized as operators which correctly close under commutation , in order to have a consistent theory .",

    "we will present only a brief review of some underlying ideas in supersymmetry , which are relevant to the construction of supersymmetric connection theories @xcite .",
    "let us start from the `` classical '' version of supersymmetric theories , which requires the introduction of grassmann numbers to represent the algebraic properties of fermionic fields .",
    "the simplest way to motivate these numbers is by starting from the quantum description of two independent fermionic operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 , defined by the following anticommutators @xmath83 with analogous expressions obtained interchanging @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "consider a realization of the above anticommutation relations in terms of coordinates and derivatives in a manner analogous to the holomorphic representation for the standard harmonic oscillator.to this end , let us introduce two independent coordinates @xmath84 and @xmath85 and define the following realization of the above operators @xmath86 the third relation in eq.([fcr ] ) requires @xmath87 , while the second relation demands that each of the above numbers must have zero square , i.e. @xmath88 . the last relation in eq.([fcr ] ) says that @xmath89 , which require that the derivative operator anticommutes with the coordinates .",

    "the product @xmath97 is called an even grassmann number because it commutes either with @xmath84 or @xmath85 and also has zero square .",

    "the superindex @xmath101 denotes standard transposition , in such a way that the array ( [ bfm ] ) is a column .",

    "let us observe that the addition and the multiplication of two supermatrices ( with both operations defined in the standard way ) is again a supermatrix . since the unit matrix @xmath115 is also a supermatrix , the inverse of a supermatrix can also be defined in the usual manner .",

    "thus , one shifts from the space of connections to the space of loops so that the wave function of the system , originally a functional of the connection , turns out to be a functional of loops . besides allowing for the construction of gauge invariant objects , loops provide a natural geometric framework to describe gauge theories and gravitation .",
    "this approach is a non - local description of the dynamics and it is well suited to the discussion of non - perturbative effects .",

    "then , a tower of wilson loops can be constructed as follows @xmath194 , \\nonumber \\\\ t^{ij}(\\alpha):&= & tr \\left[u({\\alpha}_{s_0}{}^{s_1 } ) e^i(s_1 )   u({\\alpha}_{s_1}{}^{s_2 } ) e^j(s_2 )   u({\\alpha}_{s_2}{}^{s_0 } ) \\right ] , \\dots , \\label{twl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath195 parametrizes the origin of the loop @xmath169 .",
    "each of the numbers in ( [ twl ] ) is a gauge invariant quantity and we will denote them generically by @xmath196 according to the number of insertions introduced .",
    "these objects constitute the fundamental dynamical variables used to formulate the gauge theory in this approach .",
    "the original symplectic structure ( [ cr ] ) of the gauge theory will induce a poisson brackets structure among the wilson loops of eq.([twl ] ) . in a very sketchy form",

    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the dynamical variables defined above , i.e. the wilson loops , have support on the space of closed loops on @xmath143 , which now replaces the configuration space associated to the connection representation . to complete",
    "the formulation of the gauge theory in the loop space is still necessary to rewrite the hamiltonian and the constraints in the new representation .",
    "this can be accomplished through the introduction of differential operators which act on loop dependent functions : the loop derivative and the connection derivative , for example .",
    "the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for the details .    accordingly , when quantizing the theory , the corresponding operators @xmath198 will have also support on the space of loops and they will be constructed as operators acting on a hilbert space which now will be spanned by functionals of loops .",
    "an heuristical , but very illuminating way of looking at some properties of the loop space is via the loop - transform introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite ,    @xcite.this transforms provides the change of basis from the connection representation @xmath199 to the loop representation @xmath200 in the form @xmath201 where @xmath202 is a multiloop with components @xmath203 .",
    "the measure @xmath204 $ ] in ( [ lt ] ) is not presently known and this fact is what makes this transform only an heuristical tool . the wave function of the system @xmath205 can then be projected either into the connection representation @xmath206 or into the loop representation @xmath207 , with the two projections being related by the loop transform ( [ lt ] )",
    ". the change of basis ( [ lt ] ) will provide also the representation of the operators acting in the loop space , starting from their counterparts in the connection representation .",
    "nevertheless , there is an alternative way to this construction , based upon the formulation of the quantum theory directly in the loop space . to this end ,",
    "one starts from the poisson brackets relations ( [ pbwl ] ) among the wilson loops . following the standard procedure ,",
    "the classical variables are promoted into operators @xmath208 and their poisson brackets are translated into commutators .",
    "a basis in the loop space is constructed by first defining the zero - loop state @xmath209 such that @xmath210 .",
    "an arbitrary multiloop state @xmath211 is subsequently constructed by the action @xmath212 .",
    "then , using the commutation relations it is possible to figure out the action of any operator upon the multiloop states .",
    "@xcite contains a very nice and explicit application of these ideas .",
    "being gauge invariant , the wilson loop variables automatically satisfy the gauss law constraints of the theory . in this way",
    ", the arbitrary multiloop quantum states constructed by the action of the operators @xmath213 on the zero loop state , will be automatically annihilated by the quantum gauss law constraints .",
    "the equivalence between the connection representation and the loop representation of gauge theories defined over a lie algebra was proved in ref.@xcite for the group @xmath214 .",
    "there , it is given a procedure to reconstruct , up to a gauge transformation , the gauge field at each point ( written as a complex matrix ) starting from the knowledge of all the wilson loops @xmath215 going through that point , together with the imposition of the so called mandelstam identities , which set constraints among the wilson loops .",
    "this construction demonstrates that the mandelstam identities are a sufficient set of conditions on the wilson loop variables which guarantee that such variables represent a local gauge theory over a lie algebra .",
    "let us summarize what has been done by saying that the loop space formulation of classical gauges theories starts from an infinite set @xmath216 of numerical , non - local , gauge invariant degrees of freedom , defined over loops in the three - dimensional surface @xmath143 .",
    "these variables replace those of the standard local connection representation , @xmath217 , which are not gauge invariant .",
    "the loop space degrees of freedom are basically traces of group elements , which in the sequel will be thought of as traces of matrices of a given dimension .",
    "now , it is well known that the cayley - hamilton theorem of linear algebra , for example , sets relations among the traces of powers of a given matrix , which depend on the dimension of the representation .",
    "as we will show in the sequel , a similar mechanism induces relations among the different wilson loops @xmath218 , with the consequence that @xmath219 is an overcomplete set of dynamical variables .",
    "these relations among powers of traces of products of matrices are generically known as mandelstam identities ( mi ) . even in the standard case ( i.e. gauge theories over a lie algebra )",
    "there is lacking a general procedure to obtain the full set of mi for arbitrary restricted groups .",
    "the situation in the case where the connection is valued on a super lie algebra is still more open and we hope that some of the ideas presented here could provide a starting point to deal with these problems .    at the quantum level , these mi will generate , via the loop transform ( [ lt ] ) for example , relations among the multiloop states , which will make this set also overcomplete .    in this way , any loop space formulation of a gauge theory will require the knowledge of the corresponding complete set of mi , in order that the true degrees of freedom of the system can be identified .",
    "the subsequent problem of imposing and/or solving the mi is still highly involved and has been carried over , for example , in the following cases : ( i ) @xmath141 pure lattice gauge @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( ii ) @xmath1 dimensional einstein gravity @xcite and ( iii ) a specific sector of @xmath1 supergravity @xcite .",
    "the observation made above concerning the relation between the mi and the cayley - hamilton identities will be made more explicit in what follows , by formulating an algorithm to go from one type of identity to the other , in the generic case of matrices over the complex numbers .",
    "this procedure will be next extended to generate the generic mi for supermatrices , after having also extended the cayley - hamilton theorem to this case .",
    "the simplest mi ( known as mi of the first class ) is just the statement of the cyclic property of the trace .",
    "for any two complex square matrices @xmath103 and @xmath220 , we have @xmath221 let us consider the effect of this identity upon the loop space variable @xmath222 for example .",
    "we have @xmath223 , where we have used the composition property ( [ coic ] ) for the holonomies .",

    "( [ cpot ] ) implies @xmath225 which arises either from the loop transform ( [ lt ] ) , or from the method of creating the quantum loop space vectors starting from the zero loop state @xmath209 .",
    "the above constitutes a very simple example of the overcompleteness of both the classical loop space variables together with the corresponding quantum states .",
    "all the remaining mi are known as mandelstam identities of the second class and there is a hierarchy of them , according to the restrictions satisfied by the group under consideration .",
    "suppose we are dealing with a group representation in terms of @xmath110 matrices @xmath103 .",
    "there will be what we call a generic mi , related to the specific dimension @xmath226 .",
    "if we impose further restrictions upon the representation , like unit determinant or unitarity , for example , new mi reflecting them have to be generated .",
    "most of what we will discuss in these notes has to do with the generic mi and their extension to the supersymmetric case .",

    "the zero in the lhs of eq.([epid ] ) comes about because there must be a repetition when distributing @xmath226 objects among @xmath231 places .",

    "our major emphasis has been in the discussion of the formulation of the mandelstam identities , which appear as unavoidable constraints either among the wilson loop variables or among the quantum loop states , that constitute the natural degrees of freedom of the method in the classical and quantum situation , respectively . in the case of pure gauge theories over a lie algebra , we have shown the equivalence between the generic mandelstam identities , for a given dimension of the representation , and the identities arising from the application of the cayley - hamilton theorem to the matrices of such representation .",
    "we have provided an algorithm to go in either direction .",
    "the main thrust of this development has been it extension to provide a general procedure to construct the generic mandelstam identities in the case of pure gauge theories defined over a super lie algebra , as a first step to deal with fully supersymmetric theories . a previous step in this direction",
    "has been the formulation and proof of the cayley - hamilton theorem in the case of supermatrices .",
    "the extension of this theorem proceeded in two steps : ( i ) the identification and definition of a characteristic polynomial for supermatrices and ( ii ) the proof that each supermatrix annihilates the polynomial previously defined .",

    "the resulting cayley - hamilton identities can be subsequently used to derive the corresponding mandelstam identities .",
    "two simple examples were presented .",
    "the construction of the mandelstam identities for arbitrary restricted groups or supergroups remains still an open problem .",
    "another very interesting question in the loop space formulation of gauge theories is the inclusion of fermions , which has been the subject of recent investigations .",
    "there are at least three ways of approaching this problem : ( i ) one is to consider the fermions as standard matter to be coupled to the gauge theory , ( ii ) other possibility is to consider them as pieces of a superconnection , as has been done in these work and ( iii ) the final possibility is to introduce the fermions in a fully supersymmetric theory , as partners of integer spin fields . in the first case , several matter fields like electrons @xcite and quarks",
    "@xcite have been taken onto account in the loop space picture .",
    "also , the introduction of fermions in einstein gravity has been considered in ref .",
    "the basic idea in these works is to define additional gauge invariant variables , besides the wilson loops , represented by open paths which start and end up in the fermions .",
    "as mentioned previously in the text , the possibility ( ii ) has been already considered in the case of @xmath1 super chern - simons theories and also in the recent discussion of @xmath0 canonical supergravity in the loop space approach . from a general point of view",
    ", there is still lacking a proof of the equivalence between the proposed loop space representation of these theories and the standard connection - matter formulation of them .",
    "this will require , among many other developments , the construction of generalized mandelstam identities including the open path variables together with the generalization of giles theorem to the superconnection case .",
