    "this paper is concerned with the geometry of surfaces in 3-manifolds .",
    "let us fix attention on a closed , hyperbolic 3-manifold , @xmath0 .",
    "a famous , unproven conjecture of waldhausen would imply that @xmath1 contains a surface subgroup . by work of marden , thurston , and bonahon ,",
    "these come in two varieties : geometrically infinite , which are virtual fiber groups , and geometrically finite , which are quasi - fuchsian . in the latter case",
    ", information about the geometric complexity of the group can have topological consequences .",
    "for example , @xmath2-injective immersions of surfaces can often be cut - and - pasted , or ( in the cusped case ) tubed around a boundary torus , to form new @xmath2-injective immersions ; these procedures are often easier to carry out when the surface groups in question are `` close '' to fuchsian groups ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , assuming that @xmath1 contains surface groups , it is of interest to understand their geometric complexity .",
    "the difficulty is that , given a topological description of an immersed surface , it is often difficult to describe the induced geometry .    we shall show that if @xmath3 is fibered , and the surface is immersed transverse to the suspension flow , then the geometry of the immersion depends on the geometry of a certain polygon in @xmath4 , which was introduced by cooper , long and reid .",
    "we are then able to show that if @xmath3 is virtually fibered , then @xmath1 contains quasi - fuchsian surface subgroups of unbounded geometric complexity . to make a precise statement",

    "the boundary at infinity of @xmath6 is denoted @xmath10 . for the remainder of the paper @xmath0 will represent a closed , virtually fibered , hyperbolic 3-manifold . in this setting",
    ", it will be convenient to define a _ surface group _ to be the fundamental group of a * closed * , orientable surface of positive genus .",

    "lemma [ thick ] then gives a simple criterion , in terms of the `` leaf polygon '' , for showing that a sequence of such immersions is thick , in the sense of theorem [ main ] .    in the final section ,",
