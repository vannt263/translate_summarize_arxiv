    "tracers in a turbulent flow separate in an explosive manner .",
    "their averaged square distance becomes independent of their initial separation and grows as @xmath0 at large times .",
    "this explains the ability of turbulence to considerably enhance mixing @xcite , but also links to fundamental issues in turbulence , where a key question is to relate the irregularity of the lagrangian flow with the persistence of a finite dissipation at infinite reynolds numbers @xcite . since the first observation of the @xmath0 law by @xcite and its interpretation in terms of kolmogorov s similarity hypothesis by @xcite , precise experimental and numerical measurements and acute modelling of pair separation have proven to be a particularly laborious exercise , as stressed for instance in the reviews by @xcite and @xcite .    a difficulty in observing the explosive law stems from the huge separation of timescales that it requires .",
    "@xcite indeed showed that the @xmath0 law is preceded by a ballistic regime during which the mean - square separation is @xmath1 .",
    "this dominates relative dispersion as long as the initial velocity difference between the tracers has not changed much , that is up to times of the order of the eddy turnover time @xmath2 associated to the inertial - range initial separation @xmath3 hereafter referred to as batchelor s timescale .",
    "the explosive @xmath0 law takes over at times @xmath4 .",
    "while batchelor s predictions are quantitatively confirmed in particle - tracking experiments @xcite and in direct numerical simulations @xcite , the most manifest observations of the @xmath0 law are limited to initial separations @xmath3 close to the kolmogorov dissipative scale @xmath5 @xcite . for particles",
    "whose initial separation lies in the inertial range , the @xmath0 growth is more elusive and emerges at best as a short transient on times both much larger than @xmath6 and smaller than the integral timescale , from which the separation between tracer particles becomes purely diffusive .",
    "even though the @xmath0 explosive law can be understood on purely dimensional grounds , there is today a lack of sufficiently accurate data that would substantiate the @xmath0 law and constrain the underlying mechanisms .",
    "long - established modelling of relative dispersion is based on the assumption that distances between tracers undergo a scale - dependent diffusion  @xcite .",
    "as stressed by @xcite , this presupposes to observe the system on a timescale @xmath7 much longer than the lagrangian correlation time @xmath8 of the velocity difference between tracers at a distance @xmath9 . for separations of the order of the typical separation @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 denoting the mean kinetic energy dissipation rate of the turbulent flow ) , this presumes that @xmath12 and thus leads to the unrealistic assumption that the lagrangian correlation time is much shorter than the eulerian turnover time .",
    "markovian models involving the joint evolution of separations and velocity differences have been introduced to circumvent such drawbacks @xcite .",
    "they are mainly based on the shortness of acceleration correlation times in turbulence and usually rely on the input of eulerian single - time statistics . possible pitfalls in their justification relate to neglecting long - term memory effects due to the persistence of turbulent flows . in an ideal infinite - reynolds number turbulent flow ,",
    "most markovian models admit scaling solutions of the form @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , at the same time , a small - scale regularization is usually required in order to prevent particle pairs from collapsing together at a finite time with a vanishing velocity difference .",
    "the scaling solutions depicted above are usually coexisting with their `` dual '' @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "on the one hand , preventing possible finite - time singularities requires modelling the dissipative - range physics of turbulence . on the other hand",
    ", such events might correspond to the loss of memory that could justify the applicability of diffusive approaches at sufficiently large times .",
    "the recent numerical studies of relative dispersion by @xcite and @xcite have clearly stressed the importance of small scales on the overall evolution of distances : some pairs remain trapped at scales @xmath17 for very long times and give an important contribution to the average separation . accounting for such trapping events",
    "has motivated the introduction of non - markovian models @xcite .",
    "most of them rely on prescribing a distribution of waiting times .",
    "we follow here a slightly different route to account for non - markovianity .",
    "numerical data from a large - scale simulation of 3d homogenous turbulence are used , to question the possibility that systematic deviations for the distribution of the inter - particle separations from richardson s self - similar solution could stem from a multiplicative process .",
    "we motivate this possibility using a handwaving description of a ballistic phenomenology , observed to be compatible with the bulk of the distribution of distances .",
    "we then flesh this observation and describe a piecewise - ballistic phenomenological toy model , which yields a whole family of self - similar distributions for the inter - particle distances , and predict that the distributions of their _ logarithms _ should collapse towards a well - defined distribution .",
    "this prediction is then tested against numerical data .",
    "most models for relative dispersion reproduce the @xmath0 explosive law fo the long - time behaviour of the mean - square separation . however , they usually yield different probability distributions of the distance @xmath9 between tracers at time @xmath7 .",
    "richardson s eddy - diffusivity approach leads to the self - similar distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath18{1287 } \\ ,        \\frac{r^{2/3}}{(g\\,\\varepsilon)^{1/3}\\,t}\\right ] } ,    \\label{eq : pdfrichardson}\\ ] ] which is uniquely determined by richardson s constant @xmath19 .",
    "the only settings where this distribution is exact is for delta - correlated - in - time flows @xcite .",
    "be it using massive numerical simulations or sophisticated particle - tracking experiments , one expects to measure some systematic deviations from this distribution .",
    "those deviations exist and have been reported but , quite remarkably , they are rather mild : richardson s diffusive mechanism appears to predict correctly the bulk of the distribution and only fails to accurately describe rare events .",
    "more precisely , for tracers with an initial distance @xmath3 of the order of the kolmogorov scale , richardson s distribution seems to overestimate the fraction of particles separating faster than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath3 lies within the inertial range , it underestimates the fraction of pairs that separate faster than the average @xcite . as those deviations are very fine",
    ", one can not preclude that they are either a consequence of intermittency or of finite - reynolds - number effects that would contaminate the statistics at both very large and very small scales .",
    "a more serious concern exists , though : as stated earlier , the eddy - diffusivity framework entails short correlation times for the velocity differences between tracers and has thus debatable physical origins .    in order to remain closer to phenomenological considerations ,",
    "we propose a completely different mechanism that relies on batchelor s ballistic separation of pairs .",
    "let us imagine the following simplified scenario .",
    "two tracers initially separated by a distance @xmath3 inside the inertial range will follow a ballistic motion with a velocity difference @xmath20 for a short period of time @xmath21 . by kolmogorov 1941 phenomenology",
    "the time and velocity should scale as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , after the time @xmath21 the pair will be separated by a distance @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is in principle a scale - independent random variable that accounts for the fluctuations of the flow . applying the same argument to @xmath26 we find @xmath27 where @xmath28 is independent of @xmath25 , and so on .",
    "finally , the relative distance between the two tracers at time @xmath7 is given by @xmath29 with @xmath30 , where by construction the number of terms is @xmath31 .",
    "although naive , such a piecewise - ballistic phenomenology relies on the physical ideas of batchelor and makes use of the ballistic separation between tracers whose validity is strongly assessed by numerics and experiments .",
    "this scenario suggests that the @xmath0 law may appear as the consequence of the separations increasing multiplicatively rather than additively .",
    "if such was indeed the case , the natural observable is not the distance but rather its _ logarithm _ , which is then expected to self - average . indeed all the @xmath32 random variables @xmath33 are independent and identically distributed . by the law of large numbers",
    ", we thus expect at large times @xmath34 .    to test those ideas we analyse data from a large direct numerical simulation of 3d homogeneous turbulence inside a triply - periodic box , which uses @xmath35 grid points to achieve a taylor - based reynolds number @xmath36 and is seeded with @xmath37 tracers ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "figure [ fig : evol_distrib_lnr](a ) shows the evolution of the average of the logarithm @xmath38 of the inter - particle separations , together with its standard deviation .",
    "the statistics are conditioned on the initial distances @xmath3 between the particles , which are chosen to lie within the inertial range ( between @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) . to deal with dimensionless quantities ,",
    "distances between pairs of tracers are divided by their initial separations , while timescales are divided by the associated batchelor time scale .     for various initial separations",

    "one also expect that the variance @xmath51 increases as @xmath52 .",
    "this feature is clearly not observed : the standard deviation of the logarithm rather reaches a plateau for times much longer than the batchelor time @xmath6 . from the latter observation , we can not exclude that the evolution of the inter - particle distances be multiplicative .",
    "yet , such a multiplicative evolution would need to be non - markovian .",
    "in other words a non constant time stepping may be involved in the above phenomenology .",
    "this would break the assumptions of the law of large numbers .",
    "figure [ fig : evol_distrib_lnr](b ) shows the time evolution of the probability distribution of @xmath46 . after a short transient",
    ", one observes a self - similar regime , which might explain the behaviours of both the average and the standard deviation . indeed ,",
    "if the distribution of distances takes the scale - invariant form @xmath53 $ ] , with @xmath54 an arbitrary function of time , then the distribution of @xmath55 can be written @xmath56 $ ] , with @xmath57=\\phi[{\\rm    e}^z]$ ] .",
    "this leads to @xmath58 where the ( time - independent ) moments of @xmath59 are obtained by using the distribution @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "note that by construction @xmath60 does not depend on the initial conditioning @xmath3 .",
    "if in addition @xmath54 is a power - law of @xmath7 , then @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as observed in the data . for richardson distribution , @xmath63 and , remarkably , the full distribution of @xmath59 depends neither on the constant @xmath64 , nor on any other physical quantities .",
    "hence , once @xmath65 is known , the distribution of @xmath46 induced by   does not require any fitting .",
    "the behaviours associated to richardson s distribution are displayed in figure  [ fig : evol_distrib_lnr](a ) dashed and solid lines .",
    "they give a good approximation for both the mean and the standard deviation of @xmath46 . as seen in figure  [",
    "fig : evol_distrib_lnr](b ) , after the transient given by the batchelor timescale , richardson s distribution reproduces well the bulk but fails to accurately predict the extreme fluctuations of @xmath46 .",
    "this can hardly be blamed on finite - range effects as almost all separations are well inside the inertial range as indicated by the two vertical arrows .",
    "the most noticeable departure from richardson s distribution occurs at separations much smaller than their average .",
    "we indeed clearly observe @xmath66 , hereby evidencing a power - law behaviour @xmath67 for distances ( as already observed by * ? ? ?",
    "this contrasts to the scaling @xmath68 obtained from eddy - diffusivity models in the k41 framework , including in addition to richardson s model those where the diffusion coefficient depends also on time ( _ i.e. _ of the form @xmath69 , see * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the statistics of extreme events can not be captured by simple diffusive models .",
    "however , as we will now see , the heuristic multiplicative approach described earlier can be refined .",
    "it leads to a qualitative understanding of the self - similarity and the tails of the distributions observed in figure [ fig : evol_distrib_lnr](b ) .",
    "a model that predicts the long - time @xmath0 explosive law but disregards the short - time ballistic behaviour may yield some biased insights , as it will probably fail to take into account the intrinsic non - markovian nature of pair separation . @xcite and @xcite therefore choose to study pair dispersion in terms of a diffusion equation with a memory kernel .",
    "we explore here an alternative scenario where we literally implement the ballistic ideas .",
    "we argue that this short - time behaviour can be thought of not only as a transient feature but as the central ingredient , that yields the explosive regime . to this end",
    ", we propose a piecewise - ballistic scenario of tracers separation , described in terms of a toy stochastic model which fits into the general class of so - called _ continuous - time random walks _",
    "( ctrw , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the model is rooted on a very intuitive phenomenology , which is in a sense built in to yield the @xmath0 law .",
    "yet , it also captures non - trivial features of the large - time statistics of the separations between tracers , among which their self - similarity , their explosive nature , and a qualitative description of the distributions of extreme events .",
    "given a pair of tracers , we denote @xmath70 and @xmath71 their separation and relative velocity , respectively .",
    "a `` ballistic modelling '' consists in assuming that during a time - lapse @xmath72 , the velocity @xmath73 remains constant , so that @xmath74 .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite for separations inside the inertial range , the ballistic motion holds typically for a time @xmath72 of the order of the time needed to damp out @xmath75 with the average turbulent dissipation rate @xmath11 , namely @xmath76 . applying recursively",
    "this heuristic argument suggests that the separation between the two tracers undergoes a sequence of non - correlated ballistic increases or decreases at times @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79  @xmath80 ( see figure [ fig : ballistic_scheme ] left ) .",
    "defining the origin of time such that @xmath81 , the separation @xmath82 , and corresponding time @xmath80 will then evolve jointly as @xmath83 in the language of ctrw , the values @xmath84 are called the _ turning points _ of the process . between two successive turning points ,",
    "the separation is by construction ballistic , so that its value at any time can be obtained by linear interpolation .",
    "this choice corresponds to a _ leaping _ ctrw , as already used by @xcite in the context of a levy walk description of turbulent pair dispersion . to entirely describe the statistics of the separations , one now only needs to prescribe statistics ( _ i _ ) for the moduli of the relative velocities @xmath85 , and ( _ ii _ ) for the longitudinal components of the velocities @xmath86 . in principle",
    "the distribution of turbulent velocity differences non - trivially depends on the scale @xmath87",
    ". this can be due to finite - size effects , so that one has to distinguish between dissipative , inertial , and integral scales .",
    "we focus here on separations that always remain within the inertial range and exclude any intermittent corrections to k41 similarity hypothesis . while crude",
    ", such an assumption will prove to be sufficient to reproduce the main mechanisms of relative dispersion . in this framework , the relevant inputs are the statistics of @xmath88 the variables @xmath89 $ ] should have an asymmetric distribution in order to reproduce the skewness of longitudinal velocity differences in turbulence .",
    "the variables @xmath90 account for the fluctuations in the rate of energy transfer and , under k41 assumptions , should be independent of the @xmath91 s",
    ". the time lapses between two consecutive turning points may be thought of as correlation times : it is then natural to prescribe that both @xmath92 and @xmath90 be independently distributed .",

    "this is however not the case here , as the time associated to a given pair of tracers is itself a random variable , which is neither additive nor multiplicative . in the present paper ,",
    "we do not need to prescribe further the distributions of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the only constraint concerns the quantity @xmath103 .",
    "it is required to be positive in order to ensure that the times @xmath80 go to infinity as the number of turning points diverges .",
    "this prevents the sequence @xmath80 from converging and the two tracers from touching each other in a finite time .",
    "we shall not here attempt to work out in full mathematical details the statistics of the separations which the model predicts .",
    "rather , we focus on a general and qualitative description of those , based on simple physical arguments .",
    "the piecewise - ballistic scenario as modeled by the system yields a whole family of self - similar distributions for the separations . to understand the origin of this self - similarity , it is convenient to introduce the non - dimensional `` logarithmic '' variables @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a characteristic time lapse associated to the initial separation @xmath3 .",
    "the largest values of @xmath106 indicate pairs that separate faster than the typical explosive separation , while large negative values are obtained when they get close to each other .",
    "we next define @xmath107 the probability density of @xmath46 conditioned on @xmath96 , regardless of the number of turning points needed to reach this time , and write @xmath108 the corresponding average .",
    "self - similarity is achieved if the statistics of the variable @xmath109 become steady at long times , _",
    "e.g. _ when @xmath110 . a rigorous proof that @xmath109 evolves towards a stationary distribution @xmath111 goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "still , let us give qualitative arguments , starting from the evolution of @xmath112 and @xmath109 .",

    "a typical realization of the @xmath109 s is shown in figure  [ fig : ballistic_scheme ] ( right ) .",
    "they fluctuate around the specific value @xmath114 , univocally defined by @xmath115 it is easily shown that @xmath114 is always negative .",
    "the evolution of @xmath109 can then be decomposed as the sum of a noise @xmath116 with zero mean and a restoring stochastic force @xmath117 , namely @xmath118 the force @xmath119 is a decreasing function of @xmath106 and changes sign at @xmath120 .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath114 to be a recurrent point .",
    "this is the source of the stationarity of the process @xmath109 , which we have observed numerically .",
    "the stationarity of @xmath109 has several consequences .",
    "first , the average logarithmic separation grows asymptotically when @xmath121 as @xmath122 ( see inset of figure [ fig : ballistic_scheme ] right ) , while its variance becomes constant , as observed earlier in our data .",
    "second , the stationarity of @xmath109 implies an explosive behaviour of separations .",
    "the initial separation @xmath3 does not appear in the dynamics ( [ eq : turningpoints_lambdatheta ] ) .",
    "also , one can easily see that the specific choice of @xmath21 ensures that @xmath3 can be simplified in the definition of @xmath109 .",
    "the dependence upon the initial separation is thus entailed in the definition of @xmath112 .",
    "however , this dependence disappears when @xmath123 , so that the stationary distribution of @xmath109 is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , for large - enough times the probability density of the logarithmic separations is simply translated by the dynamics around its average value : @xmath124 .",
    "this implies that , at large times , the statistics of the distance @xmath9 approach the self - similar form @xmath125 $ ] , which is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the piecewise ballistic mechanism does not yield a single but a whole family of self - similar distributions @xmath111 , depending on the choices of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we can however try to characterize the tails of @xmath111 .",
    "the right - end tail ( @xmath126 ) corresponds to tracers that separate faster than the average . at large times",
    ", the piecewise model predicts that @xmath127 is negative , or in other words , that the logarithmic distance @xmath46 is strictly smaller than three halves of the logarithmic time .",
    "it is indeed easily checked that if @xmath106 is negative at a given turning point , then it remains negative afterwards .",
    "as @xmath106 winds up fluctuating around @xmath128 , it is almost surely negative at large times .",
    "a noticeable consequence is that the limiting self - similar distributions have a right - end cutoff .",
    "such a behaviour contrasts that obtained from eddy - diffusivity models ( including richardson s ) , whose tails fall as a double exponential at large values .",
    "the other tail ( @xmath129 ) captures the statistics of pairs that are _ not _ separated .",
    "numerical simulations of the model reveal that its form does strongly depend on the distribution of @xmath93 and @xmath94 . to understand further this behaviour , let us define @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and describe two asymptotic regimes @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "+ ( _ i _ ) @xmath132 describes a situation where tracers almost never come close to each other .",
    "when they do so , they are immediately pulled back to their initial separation by the restoring force @xmath134 . in this case ,",
    "one - step excursions dominate the left - end tail of the statistics , which is therefore entirely determined by the distribution of @xmath135 .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) the case @xmath136 is opposite . here",
    ", two particles need to undergo a large number of ballistic steps to be pulled back towards @xmath114 .",
    "the time of each step is in average smaller than typical correlation time @xmath137 at @xmath138 . in this limit",
    ", the noise is dominant and the discrete dynamics can be approximated by a brownian motion with a positive drift .",
    "one can check that this yields a stationary distribution whose left - end tail is @xmath139 where @xmath140 depends on the noise kernels . with an accurate choice of the noises ,",
    "the left exponential slope is therefore likely to be shallower than richardson s left exponential slope of @xmath141 , as suggested by the numerical data .",
    "at this point , one may wonder whether the piecewise - ballistic phenomenology achieves a better description of the full statistics than richardson s distribution . as the precise shape of the statistics obtained from the piecewise - ballistic scenario are noise - dependent , a detailed answer would require to plug into our stochastic model some `` realistic noises '' for the distributions of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this goes beyond our intention , since we consider here the set of equations ( [ eq : turningpoints_rt ] ) as a `` scenario '' rather than a genuine `` modelling '' of the separations .    to our taste ,",
    "the main virtue of the model is that it provides a non - markovian physical interpretation to the explosive nature of the inter - particle separations , _ viz .",
    "_ , the independence upon the initial separation .",
    "we believe that dynamical memory effects are essential for the understanding of extreme events in relative dispersion . one may therefore wonder whether such effects are universal and whether their signature is intrinsically linked to the explosive separation .",
    "a related question concerns the origin of the observed deviations to richardson s self - similar distribution .",
    "are they due to finite - size effects , to the intermittency of velocity statistics , or rather , as we think , to the limits of the eddy - diffusivity approach ?",
    "our impression is that this question has been somehow overlooked in the previous literature .",
    "experimental and numerical datasets are often confronted to richardson s distribution using a linlog representation of the distance neighbour function @xmath142 in such a way that richardson s distribution appears as a straight line  ( see , _",

    "note that a casual choice for the statistics of @xmath93 and @xmath94 makes the piecewise ballistic steady distribution ( solid line ) fit the data better .",
    "the model predicts a sharp cutoff at large values .",
    "however , the current statistical accuracy does not enable us to discriminate between such a behaviour and the double exponential obtained in the framework of eddy - diffusivity approaches .    to conclude ,",

    "the proposed toy model displays a number of general trends that include ( _ i _ ) the explosive nature of the statistics , or in other words the property that the steady distributions do not depend on the initial separation ; ( _ ii _ ) their self - similarity , which makes the statistics of the logarithm of the separation collapse towards a single distribution ; ( _ iii _ ) the presence of a right - end cutoff in the associated probability density ; ( _ iv _ ) the growth of the average of the logarithmic separation as three halves of the logarithmic time , compatible with the @xmath0 law , resulting from the multiplicative nature of the separation process .",
