    "the samples studied here were 50  nm thick films of fe@xmath0co@xmath1si , grown epitaxially on si ( 111 ) by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) using the method described in references and .",
    "these films appear to be single crystal on the basis of x - ray and low energy electron diffraction techniques@xcite , but in fact show twinning structures that are subtle to detect . as the process of growing by mbe does not break the degeneracy between the two possible chiral structures of the b20 unit cell , one may expect grains of both left- and right - handed chirality , structures that are shown in figures [ fig : tms_tem]a and [ fig : tms_tem]b .",
    "it is possible to distinguish these two chiral grains using a dark field transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) method@xcite .",
    "when viewing a plan - view specimen along the @xmath8 $ ] za , a non - coincident superposition of the two chiral structures is observed in the electron diffraction pattern ( see figure s1 in the supplementary information ) .",
    "dark field images displayed in figures [ fig : tms_tem]c and [ fig : tms_tem]d were formed with the objective aperture centered over the @xmath9 and @xmath10 reflections of figures [ fig : tms_tem]e and [ fig : tms_tem]f respectively .",
    "these reveal a structure comprised of opposite chirality grains , which are seen to be roughly equiaxed and typically 100 - 200 nm in lateral size .",
    "microdiffraction patterns from areas of opposite chirality are shown in figures [ fig : tms_tem]e and [ fig : tms_tem]f , with convergent beam microdiffraction simulations of left - handed and right - handed structures shown in [ fig : tms_tem]g and [ fig : tms_tem]h respectively .",
    "left- and right - handed structures in bulk host magnetic helices of opposite handedness@xcite .",
    "hence , our epilayer will host chiral textures with opposite in - plane windings in equal abundance , with complex magnetisation textures to be found at the grain boundaries@xcite .        in bulk films",
    "the helical orientation is defined by weak anisotropic exchange along a cubic [ 100 ] axis@xcite . in our films",
    "the @xmath11 biaxial strain due to the lattice mismatch with the substrate is relaxed over 50 nm to @xmath12 , distorting the unit cell to a rhombohedral form@xcite .",
    "this epitaxial strain raises the magnetic ordering temperature@xcite , in this case to @xmath13  k relative the the bulk @xmath14",
    "k@xcite , as shown by the field cooled ( fc ) and zero field cooled ( zfc ) magnetisation measurements in the inset of figure [ fig : mbe2600_anisotropy]a .",
    "the lattice distortion introduces a magnetic uniaxial anisotropy , revealed in the squid magnetisation loops shown in figure [ fig : mbe2600_anisotropy ] for in - plane and out - of - plane magnetic fields @xmath15 . by applying the model for helices in a film with a propagation vector out of the plane given by karhu _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite , an easy - plane uniaxial anisotropy was found , with a magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of @xmath16  kjm@xmath17 .    , width=302 ]    this anisotropic response is also found in the magnetoresistance ( mr ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mbe2600_anisotropy]b shows the @xmath15 dependence of the longitudinal resistivity @xmath18 for the three principal orientations : with @xmath15 out of plane , and with @xmath15 in - plane and the current parallel (  @xmath19 ) or perpendicular (  @xmath20 ) to the field . at low fields a negative mr is observed , which is greatest for the  @xmath19 case . at high fields ( @xmath21  t , shown inset ) we observe the isotropic linear positive mr that is characteristic of b20 f@xmath5c@xmath6s@xcite .",
    "the hysteresis in these epilayers is to be contrasted with bulk crystals , where a helical ground state can be unwound reversibly as a function of field@xcite although hysteresis has been observed in the neutron scattering profile@xcite . in these epilayers",
    "this is not the case , loss of the zfc state is irreversible , unless the sample is warmed above @xmath22 .",
    "the period of the helical wave in the f@xmath5c@xmath6s  series has been studied in bulk using small angle polarised neutron scattering@xcite . for @xmath23 , as used in this study , @xmath24  nm . based upon the easy - plane anisotropy , one may expect that there exists a helimagnetic ground state in these epilayers that can only be reached by cooling in fields close to zero . in order to determine the periodicity of the helices we performed polarised neutron reflectometry ( pnr ) on a larger epilayer ( see supplementary figures s2 and s3 for its characterisation ) .",
    "the sample s easy plane implies in - plane spins and hence an out - of - plane propagation vector for the helices . following the method of karhu _ _ et al.__@xcite ,",
    "the epilayer was cooled in a 5  mt in - plane field ( smaller than the coercive field ) which will align the helices with opposite chirality that will be found in the racemic grain structure determined by tem ( figure [ fig : tms_tem ] ) .",
    "this field cooling then produces a spin density wave ( sdw ) as the spatial average of the helices of opposite chirality , shown schematically in figure [ fig : spinasym]g , which may be detected by pnr .    ,",
    "width=321 ]    the spin asymmetry in the neutron reflectivities is shown for @xmath25 , 100 , and 500  mt ( saturation ) in figures [ fig : spinasym]a , [ fig : spinasym]c and [ fig : spinasym]e , respectively ( see figure s4 in the supplementary information for the corresponding reflectivity spectra ) .",
    "the solid lines are fits generated from the scattering length density ( sld ) profiles shown in figures [ fig : spinasym]b , [ fig : spinasym]d and [ fig : spinasym]f . at saturation",
    "the spin asymmetry is fitted well by a model with a uniform magnetic depth profile ( figure [ fig : spinasym]i ) with 0.10 @xmath26 , in good agreement with the 0.12 @xmath26 calculated from the saturation moment measured by squid ( figure [ fig : mbe2600_anisotropy ] ) . at 5 and 100",
    "mt a feature is observed at a wavevector transfer @xmath27 @xmath28 that is not present at saturation . the position and sign of this ( and the neighbouring ) feature requires a periodicity of the magnetic profile of @xmath29 nm to achieve a good fit .    combining this result with those from the magnetometry reveals differences in @xmath30  mev  compared to @xmath31 mev  where @xmath32 is the spin per unit cell and @xmath33 the dmi constant .",
    "the spin wave stiffness , @xmath34  mev@xmath35 , was also changed from the bulk value@xcite , @xmath36  mev@xmath35 .",
    "the ratio @xmath37 determines the spatial scale of magnetic modulations in the material .",
    "the sld profile at 5  mt arises from a model where the helices are distorted by the finite field@xcite , depicted in figure [ fig : spinasym]h .",
    "this distortion will be greater at 100  mt .",
    "the sld is offset from zero field implying a non - trivial chiral structure with periodicity @xmath38 , which might be a superposition of fm and periodic states , helicoids , a skewed conical phase , or in - plane skyrmions@xcite .",
    "it is currently unclear what magnetic textures are expected at structural chiral grain boundaries and these are likely to be important in determining the true three - dimensional magnetic structure .",
    "magnetic skyrmion states can be imaged directly@xcite , observed indirectly using scattering experiments@xcite , or have often been inferred from the influence of the chiral spin structure on conduction spins through the topological hall effect@xcite . as an electron traverses a magnetisation texture with its spin should adiabatically follow the local spin orientation . in doing",
    "so it accumulates a geometric ( berry ) phase if the texture possesses a non - zero skyrmion winding number density , defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a unit vector along the local magnetisation direction : for a chiral skyrmion lattice integrating this over a unit cell yields exactly @xmath41 per skyrmion .",
    "this phase can be considered to be equivalent to an aharonov - bohm phase in a fictitious magnetic field equal to minus one flux quantum , @xmath42 , per skyrmion winding number@xcite , leading to the so - called topological hall effect ( the ) .",
    "the hall resistivity @xmath43 in our films arises from three main contributions : the ordinary , anomalous , and topological hall effects .",
    "thus , we write the total hall resistivity as : @xmath44 from the ordinary hall contribution @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the ordinary hall coefficient , we can determine the film carrier density , @xmath47 .",
    "the anomalous hall resistivity @xmath48 originates from spin - orbit coupling and is proportional to the magnetisation , @xmath49@xcite .",
    "@xmath50 is a function of the longitudinal resistivity @xmath18 and thus varies with temperature and field .",
    "the final term is the topological hall contribution @xmath51 .",
    "the measured total hall resistivity @xmath52 of our film at 5 k is shown in figures [ fig : tms_the005k]a and [ fig : tms_the005k]c , and exhibits hysteresis . in the same figure we plot a scaled form of the magnetisation @xmath53 .",
    "the meaning of the scaling constant @xmath54 and the scaling procedure are described in the supplementary information .",
    "inspection of equation [ eqn : allhallsupp ] shows that @xmath55 , which is plotted in figures [ fig : tms_the005k]b and [ fig : tms_the005k]d .",
    "this displays sharp extrema at @xmath56 mt superposed on a weakly hysteretic broad background extending up to about 0.7  t. the sharp features occur at a field that corresponds to a non - zero magnetisation where a kink appears in @xmath49 .    the the arises from the presence of magnetic textures with non - zero skyrmion winding number , and skyrmions",
    "have been observed in f@xmath5c@xmath6s  at equivalent fields@xcite , so it seems natural to assume that the observed the is due to the formation of skyrmions in our epilayers .",
    "whilst there are , in addition to this work , a few reported instances of the observation of a topological hall effect in b20-ordered epilayers of various materials under these conditions@xcite , recent analytical modelling predicts that an easy - plane anisotropy should suppress the formation of skyrmions in an out - of - plane field@xcite .",
    "it may be that the approximations in the analytical model do not fully capture the relevant physics and these results can be accounted for by the presence of true chiral skyrmion lattice textures . on the other hand , wilson _",
    "proposed a laterally modulated cone phase texture@xcite that also has non - zero skyrmion winding number .",
    "various materials have exhibited the the , the majority of which are b20 crystals , but with some exceptions such as orthorhombic ( b31 ) mnp which has a fan like spin structure@xcite implying that magnetic textures other than the skyrmions may generate a the .",
    "it is therefore convenient to discuss our results in terms of an areal skyrmion winding number density @xmath57 . in the case of a true skyrmion lattice , @xmath57 is the skyrmion areal number density .",
    "the peak magnitude of the the we observe , @xmath58  n@xmath2 cm , is very large",
    ". a recent study of mnsi under pressure reported a giant the of @xmath59  n@xmath2cm@xcite , roughly an order of magnitude greater than under ambient conditions@xcite .",
    "of comparable size is the the in the cubic perovskite srfeo@xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the largest effect observed prior to our observations in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si was in mnge ( 160 n@xmath2cm)@xcite , which has very small ( 4  nm ) skyrmions , implying an emergent magnetic field of hundreds of teslas .    using a simple model@xcite , we can account for the very large value of the the in our fe@xmath0co@xmath1si epilayer .",
    "a large the requires a large spin polarization of the current , @xmath61 , a high areal density of skyrmion winding number , @xmath57 , and a low carrier concentration .",
    "since the emergent field is simply @xmath62 , the the can be written as @xmath63 fe@xmath0co@xmath1si is a doped semiconductor with the parent ( fesi ) a narrow gap insulator@xcite . by virtue of this doping ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath46 for our sample is @xmath64  n@xmath2cmt@xmath28 ( corresponding to approximately one electron - like carrier per co dopant ) , much larger than metallic mnsi@xcite ( 16  n@xmath2cmt@xmath28 ) .",
    "electron doping with cobalt introduces carriers which for @xmath65 are fully spin polarised@xcite .",
    "our @xmath23 films have been measured to have a high spin polarisation of @xmath66@xcite .",
    "the high spin polarisation and ordinary hall coefficient contribute towards the large the we observe .",
    "the last remaining factor to address is the emergent field : the values given above imply a value of @xmath67  t at the the peak . using the pnr helical wavevector and considering a hexagonally close - packed skyrmion crystal , a skyrmion size of @xmath68  nm is obtained . substituting the above parameters into equation [ eqn : the ] requires @xmath69 to match the observed magnitude of @xmath51 , where @xmath70 is the density for a hexagonally close - packed skyrmion crystal of the expected size .",
    "assuming the presence of skyrmions , there are three possible explanations for this discrepancy : a much lower skyrmion packing density than @xmath70 ( skyrmions in a mnsi epilayers were reported to take up a glassy arrangement@xcite ) ; anisotropy in the helix pitch due to the rhombohedral crystal structure , yielding larger in - plane skyrmions than the measured out - of - plane helix period implies ; or regions that lack a topological winding number ( skyrmions are not supported close to the chiral grain boundaries@xcite ) .",
    "all three effects are likely to co - exist in our samples .    the temperature dependence of the the is illustrated in figure [ fig : tms_themaps ] , where we show a phase diagram that has been constructed from a series of isothermal @xmath52 and @xmath49 sweeps ( see supplementary figure s6 ) .",
    "the the persists from @xmath71   k down to the lowest measurement temperature .",
    "the sharp maximum in the is negative for all measured temperatures .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the negative effective field in conjunction with a positive @xmath46 .",
    "equation [ eqn : the ] then implies fe@xmath0co@xmath1si has a positive spin polarisation and one would expect this behaviour where the majority spin carriers are at the fermi energy where there is relative absence of minority spins@xcite .",
    "the two contributions to the the are illustrated by figures [ fig : tms_themaps]a and [ fig : tms_themaps]b .",
    "the sharp , hysteretic maximum in the the is shown in the latter , and the phase diagram is reminiscent of that for a free skyrmion crystal , as described for bulk material , occurring at magnetic fields ( tens of mt ) similar to those reported for unstrained samples@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : tms_themaps]a shows the broader contribution similar to that observed in thin films@xcite extending to @xmath72 700 mt . at these higher fields the the and effective flux is smaller and may be attributed to chiral defects with a topological winding number , such as pinned skyrmions that might be expected at the chiral grain boundaries , persisting to higher fields .",
    "nevertheless , the topologically non - trivial phase extends over all @xmath73 and a broad field range .",
    ", width=302 ]    our data also hint at the detection of a topological contribution to @xmath18 . after a linear background and a small contribution from 2d weak localisation@xcite were removed from the out - of - plane mr , a residual contribution , @xmath74 ,",
    "remains , as shown in figure [ fig : tms_the005k]e .",
    "hysteretic minima are seen .",
    "crucially , these minima do not align with the coercive field determined from the magnetisation shown in figure [ fig : tms_the005k]d , and so can not be attributed to anisotropic magnetoresistance .",
    "instead they align with the sharp , hysteretic extremum in the the .",
    "this contribution to the magnetoresistance , @xmath75  n@xmath2 cm , is about an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath51 .",
    "contributions to the conductivity from topological berry phase effects are so far formally predicted only for @xmath43 , but monte carlo simulations by yi _ et al . _",
    "have suggested that traces of these effects may also be observed in the longitudinal resistivity@xcite . in that report ,",
    "a rise in @xmath18 was simulated that may be attributed to an enlargement of the magnetic unit cell , but no firm conclusion on its origin were drawn .",
    "weak kinks in @xmath18 were observed in an early study of mnsi under pressure@xcite .",
    "in contrast , we observe a drop in longitudinal resistivity in the field range where skyrmions are present . in order to interpret the origin of this effect , a complete knowledge of the magnetic topology",
    "may be required .",
    "this contribution is lost for @xmath76 k ( see supplementary fig .",
    "s7 ) , suggesting that phase coherence may play a role in the underlying mechanism .",
    "a large the has been observed in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si epilayers by virtue of the high spin - polarisation , low carrier concentration , and compact skyrmion size .",
    "fingerprints of possible topological contributions are also observed in the longitudinal resistivity .",
    "many of these parameters , such as doping level or epitaxial strain , are open to engineering in order to give control of the functional properties arising from these novel topological spin textures .",
    "our epilayers are grown on commercial si wafers and are amenable to planar processing required for device manufacture .",
    "the presence of such a large the has important implications for skyrmion - based spintronics@xcite , such as the detection of skyrmions in current - controlled memory cells@xcite .",
