    "one of the many interesting results from _ rosat _",
    "all - sky survey @xcite was the discovery of seven objects that appear to be nearby , thermally - emitting neutron stars that have little if any magnetospheric emission ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "these objects , known most commonly as `` isolated neutron stars , '' ( ins ) are distinguished by their long spin periods ( @xmath9  s , when measured ) , largely thermal spectra with cool temperatures ( @xmath10  ev ) , faint optical counterparts , and lack of radio emission .",
    "thermally - emitting neutron stars have been the targets of many observations , as they can potentially be used to constrain the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron stars , and thereby explore nuclear physics in realms inaccessible from laboratories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "two main approaches are used .",
    "the first , using the spectrum , seems simple : determine the effective angular size from spectral fits , multiply by the distance ( obtained by other means ) , and one has the apparent radius .",
    "this radius can be converted into the physical radius through use of mass .",
    "the radius is the crucial quantity in differentiating between eos , as most eos predict a distinctive but small range of radii for a large range of masses .",
    "the second method is to use measurements of an ensemble of neutron stars to constrain cooling curves , which are themselves sensitive to the eos and the interior composition ( for a review , * ? ? ?",
    "this also seems simple : measure the received flux of an object , convert to a luminosity using the distance , and with the age place that object on a cooling diagram .",
    "the closest of the ins , , has been the subject of much inquiry for just these purposes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "progress on these last issues has been made recently from x - ray spectroscopy @xcite and timing @xcite , but distances and ages are difficult to measure .",
    "the technique necessary for both is high - precision optical astrometry , as shown by the example of rx  j1856.5@xmath03754 : with a series of _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ )",
    "observations it was possible to measure the parallax ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "while rx  j1856.5@xmath03754  is the brightest and closest of the ins , and has thus garnered most of the attention , it is best to try to use multiple sources .",
    "this especially since each source appears to have peculiarities , be it stronger or weaker timing noise , stronger or weaker features in the x - ray spectra , presence or absence of long - term variations , or the presence of an h@xmath11 nebulae ( in the case of rx  j1856.5@xmath03754 ; @xcite ) .",

    "all - sky survey . given its low hydrogen column density ( @xmath13 ) , nearly sinusoidal",
    "8.39-s pulsations , relatively constant x - ray flux , and faint ( @xmath1  mag ) , blue optical counterpart @xcite , it was classified as a nearby , isolated , thermally - emitting neutron star .",

    "while the above properties make rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  a prototypical ins , x - ray monitoring over the last few years has uncovered unique behavior : the x - ray spectrum and pulse shape have been evolving @xcite .",

    ", we present a detailed analysis of _ hst _  observations of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  specifically designed for astrometry , which we use to measure its proper motion and parallax .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , in   [ sec : obs ] , we present the astrometric observations and discuss additional observations we used for photometry and for tying our astrometry to the international coordinate reference system ( icrs ) .",
    "we also discuss the basic reduction of these data .",
    "then , in   [ sec : photpar ] , we use the photometry to determine photometric parallaxes of the reference stars , which we use in   [ sec : parallax ] for the parallax .",
    "we discuss the implications in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] and conclude in   [ sec : conc ] .",
    "our analysis is complex and necessarily involves choices among alternate schemes .",
    "previous attempts to measure parallaxes with _ hst_made choices that were later called into question ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ) . to clarify our analysis , and to set out the framework for future work , we give full details on the parallax measurement in app .",
    "[ app : ast ] .",
    "we then show that our results are robust to the choices we made by describing various alternate analyses in app .",
    "[ app : alt ] . in",
    "what follows , we define our proper motions in right ascension and declination @xmath17 such that the scales are the same and no @xmath18 term is necessary .",
    "all uncertainties are @xmath19 unless otherwise indicated .",
    "in addition to the results presented in tables  [ tab : ast][tab : par ] , we make the raw data available electronically .",
    "our main data set consist of 64 exposures taken during eight visits of the field of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  with _ hst _ ; a summary is given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "all data were taken with the high resolution camera ( hrc , with a plate - scale of @xmath20 ) and the f475w ( sdss @xmath21 ) filter , which has good sensitivity to the blue colors of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 .",
    "we tried to optimize our observations for measuring an accurate parallax in three ways .",
    "first , we observed over two years , to minimize the covariance between proper motion and parallax , and verify repeatability .",
    "second , we observed four times per year rather than just at the parallactic maxima , to reduce possible systematic effects of observing at orientations different by 180  only .",
    "third , for the eight exposures in each epoch , we chose dither positions optimized for sampling fractional pixel phase .    in our analysis",
    ", we also use three sets of observations presented previously . for photometry ,",
    "these are b- and r - band images taken with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) on keck @xcite , and images taken with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hst _  @xcite , and for our astrometric tie , b - band observations taking with the focal reducer , low - dispersion spectrograph ( fors1 ) on the very large telescope @xcite .",
    "below , we describe first the reduction of all data sets , and then the way we measured positions from the hrc images , tied our astrometry to the international celestial reference system , and obtained photometry from the hrc , stis and lris data . for reference , we show a combined image of all hrc data in fig .  [ fig : hrc ] , with stars used in our analysis labeled .      for each data set , the basic reduction was standard : bias and dark current were subtracted , and possible pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations were corrected for using flat fields . for the _ hst _  data ,",
    "these steps are taken in the standard pipelines , while for the lris data they were performed by @xcite . for the fors images , which we retrieved from the archive and",

    "the latter terms ensure centers of bright stars are not incorrectly flagged as bad due to registration errors , focus changes , etc .",
    "we also constructed a final average for each epoch from those cleaned images .",
    "for the stis data , the analysis was similar , except that no resampling was necessary , since integer pixel offsets were used .",
    "for the lris and fors images , we used more standard methods to correct for cosmic - ray hits , in which they are identified by their narrow width compared to the seeing , and replaced by interpolation . for the photometry and astrometry below , averages were made of these filtered images , registered to integer pixel shifts .",
    "we determined positions using the `` effective '' point - spread function ( epsf ) technique of @xcite .",
    "we use the epsf determined for the hrc with the f475w filter by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) , and use a variation of their procedure for the fits . in app .",
    "[ app : pos ] , we describe where we deviate and discuss further variations ; fortunately , our results do not depend much on our choices , although the method described here gives slightly superior precision .    in our procedure , we fit stellar images on each exposure using the pixels in a radius of 2.56 pixels around an initial guess for the centroid ( determined from a gaussian fit in the average image ) , weighting data points with uncertainties @xmath45 ( where @xmath46  dn is the read - noise , which we determined empirically from variations in background regions , and @xmath47 is the gain for pipe - line processed hrc images ) .",
    "we fit simultaneously for the position and amplitude of each star , but fix the sky to the header value mdrizsky , which is determined by the pipeline drizzle process ( and is very similar to the median or mode of all pixel values ) . finally , we correct the positions for distortion in the hrc using the solution from",
    ".    to estimate uncertainties on the positions , we used the standard technique for @xmath48 fitting in which we determined the @xmath49 and @xmath50 offsets at which @xmath48 increased by  1 .",
    "it is worth noting that , generally , this is only valid if the fit is acceptable , i.e. , if @xmath48 roughly equals the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for the brightest stars , we often find much larger @xmath48 , since the psf varies due to focus changes , etc .",
    "one could rescale the errors , but this would lead one to overestimate the uncertainties of positions of stars relative to each other ( which is what enters our analysis ) , since psf changes affect all stars in the same way .",
    "therefore , we retained the formal uncertainties , verifying that they lead to acceptable fits ( see below and app .",
    "[ app : uncert ] ) .    with positions and uncertainties in hand , we solve for the best - fit transformation between the first and the other seven exposures for each epoch ( for details ,",
    "see app .",
    "[ app : ast ] ) , and determine one set of average , distortion - corrected positions per epoch . given our weighting , the four brightest stars ( a , b , 118 , and 119 )",
    "dominate the fits .",
    "for the transformation , we follow and use a 6-parameter , bi - linear transformation , as we do for the transformation between epochs ( see   [ sec : parallax ] ) .",
    "this fits for a central position , the overall plate - scale and rotation of the image , and a second plate - scale and rotation that reflect differences in scale and orientation between the two axes ( we test variations on this in app .",
    "[ app : combination ] ) .",
    "in general , when we included all measurements , the fit quality for some transformations was very poor . inspecting the outliers",
    ", we found that within the fitted region of most there were some pixels flagged as bad .",
    "these pixels are not included in the epsf fit , so to first order they should not affect the result .",
    "there is a second - order effect , however : that arises because our model epsf is not a perfect match to the real one . as stated above , generally",
    ", this does not matter for relative positions , since the epsf is wrong in the same way for all stars .",
    "but this relies on the same part of the epsf being used , which is not possible if bad pixels are present .",
    "because of this , we decided to exclude all position measurements that had bad pixels .",
    "in addition , we excluded all measurements of star 114 in epoch  4 , where it is close to the hrc occulting finger and clearly deviant , and three further significant outliers without obvious causes ( star 115 in epoch  2 , exposure  2 ; 118 in 3 ,  5 ; and a in 7 ,  7 ) .    with the above exclusions , the fits are fairly good , with the overall @xmath51 ranging from 1.00 for epoch  8 to 1.48 for epoch  5 .",
    "furthermore , all individual sources were found to fit well too ( for details , including simulated data , see app .",

    "[ fig : err ] ) .",
    "while the hrc observations provide very accurate relative positions , the precision with which these can be tied to the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) is not as good , as it is determined by the less accurately known positions of the guide stars used . to improve the precision",
    ", we use ground - based observations to tie our measurements to the ucac2 catalog @xcite , which is currently the most precise representation of the icrs for stars fainter than those measured by hipparcos .",
    "we first tied a short fors image taken on 31  december  2002 , which is very close in time to our third hrc observation , to the ucac2 catalog ( corrected to the same epoch using the ucac2 proper motions ) .",
    "we measured centroids of 13 ucac2 stars present on the image and corrected for radial distortion using the quadratic relation given by @xcite .",
    "a four - parameter transformation sufficed , with the offset accurate to 10  mas , and scale and rotation different from nominal by @xmath52% and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the fit was good , with the residuals consistent with the ucac2 uncertainties .",
    "we then used 41 stars to transfer the tie to a deeper image , consisting of twenty 620-s images from 29 , 30 , and 31 december  2002 .",
    "this fit was again good , and the uncertainties negligible compared to the first step .",
    "finally , we tied our astrometry to the hrc using 18 stars for which we could obtain accurate fors positions . using hrc positions evaluated at the fors epoch using the proper motions derived in ",
    "[ sec : parallax ] , we find an excellent tie , with offsets accurate to @xmath2  mas and a scale and position angle different from the nominal values by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively ( here , the uncertainties take into account that the hrc shows deviations from equality of scales and orthogonality ; see   [ sec : parallax ] ) .",
    "the overall precision with which our measurements are on the ucac2 system is limited by the first step , and is @xmath56  mas , similar to the precision with which ucac2 is on the icrs @xcite . for the scale and position angle ,",
    "the first and last step contribute ; we estimate that the scale is accurate to 0.02% and the position angle to @xmath57 .",
    "below , we will give positions relative to star a , fixing its position to @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "we will also correct the nominal scale and position angles of epochs 3 and  7 using the values found above .      for the hrc photometry , we measured fluxes in the averaged flat - fielded images for each epoch ( see   [ sec : hrc ] ) .",
    "since the hrc flux for rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  will help constrain the different components of the optical emission @xcite , we took care to correct for all known systematic effects , following the prescription of @xcite for flat - fielded , non - drizzled images .",
    "briefly , we first measured counts in a range of apertures using daophot @xcite , and sky in a 50 to 60 pixel annulus ( 133159 ) .",
    "we chose an aperture of 3 pixels radius ( 008 ) as a compromise between adequate signal - to - noise ratio for fainter targets and minimal effects from psf variations over the detector .",
    "next , we corrected for pixel - area variations and charge transfer inefficiencies following @xcite .",
    "we used brighter , isolated stars to determine the aperture correction to an 18-pixel ( 048 ) aperture , and added a fixed @xmath60mag to correct to `` nominal infinity '' @xcite ; the latter includes the small , @xmath61mag effect from contamination of the sky by starlight .",
    "finally , we added the zero point of 25.623 to obtain magnitudes in the vega system .",
    "we checked for , but found no significant variations for any star ( for star 113 , we rejected epochs 1 and 3 , since a trail from star a passed over the image ) . for rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 , where we list the individual measurements in table  [ tab : obs ] , the standard deviation is 0.10  mag , consistent with the error of 0.09  mag and with numbers for other faint sources ( e.g. , 0.09 and 0.10  mag for stars 112 and 108 , respectively ) .",
    "we list the average magnitudes in table  [ tab : photpar ] .    for stis",
    ", we again used daophot to measure fluxes , choosing a 2-pixel ( 01 ) aperture .",
    "we corrected for charge transfer inefficiencies following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , and used brighter stars to correct to a 10 pixel ( 05 ) radius aperture . to place our magnitudes",
    "roughly on the stsci system , we added an additional @xmath62mag to `` nominal infinity , '' and used the zero point flux of @xmath63 for a count rate of @xmath64 , and the magnitude offset of 21.1 , as described in the _ hst _  data handbook .",
    "we stress that while the results are fine for our purpose of inferring stellar colors ( since calibration errors will be taken out ) , care has to be taken in interpreting them in terms of absolute fluxes .",
    "in particular , for the flux of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  itself , see the detailed discussion in @xcite .    for the lris photometry",
    ", @xcite had found that scattered light from much brighter stars made photometry difficult , and they adopted a simplified psf fitting technique . in order to measure not just isolated stars , but also ones near others",
    ", we modified their procedure slightly , using the positional information from the hrc and picking a moffat function instead of a gaussian as a psf model .",
    "the results , listed in table  [ tab : photpar ] , are consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "they are also roughly consistent ( brighter by @xmath65mag ) with those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in measuring the parallax of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 , we need to worry about bias by parallaxes of our background sources .",
    "typical distances may range from 1 to 10kpc , inducing an effect at the 1 to 0.1mas level .",
    "generally , one might expect more nearby sources to bias the fit most , since these would be brighter and hence have heavier weight . given this , it is good to have distance estimates , which , even if wrong for individual sources , reduce any systematic bias . for this purpose ,",
    "we use our photometry : we estimate temperature from @xmath22  and flux from @xmath66 , and then infer a distance assuming the stars are on the main sequence .    for many stars , we have @xmath67  and @xmath66  magnitudes from our keck images (  [ sec : photometry ] ) . some stars , however , were too faint ( in particular in @xmath67 ) or too close to brighter stars for reliable photometry .",
    "for those , we infer @xmath22  and @xmath66  from the hrc and stis photometry , using empirical color - color relations determined from stars with uncertainties in @xmath22  smaller than 0.1  mag ; see fig .",

    "this should be compared to 70  pc for vela  ob2 , although this is a larger association with a radius of @xmath308  pc .",

    "the age we infer for rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  is comparable to simple estimates based on models of neutron star cooling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it poses a pair of puzzles .",
    "the first is that the spin - down age for rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  of 1.9  myr is a factor of 23 larger than either the cooling age or our kinematic age ( see @xcite and @xcite , who also discuss possible explanations ) . in this respect ,",
    "rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  may not be unique : the hotter neutron star has a similarly long spin - down age of 1.5  myr @xcite .",
    "the second possible puzzle is that , kinematically , rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  appears older than rx  j1856.5@xmath03754 , while its temperature is higher .",
    "thus , the sources likely differ in some other aspect .",
    "the inferred magnetic field strengths are indeed different ( @xmath2 vs. @xmath315  g ; ; @xcite ) , but this may not suffice . instead , it may reflect a small difference in mass , to which cooling appears to be especially sensitive ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "we have measured the geometric parallax to the neutron star rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  with _ hst _  to a precision of 30% , with an additional systematic uncertainty of @xmath316% . to our knowledge , at @xmath317mag ,",
    "rx  j0720.4@xmath03125is the faintest optical object for which a parallax has been measured .",
    "while the measurement is too uncertain to lead to useful constraints on the radius ( which would also require better model atmospheres ) , it helps greatly to set the demographic scale of the ins as a population relative to that of the radio pulsars , for which parallaxes of this magnitude have been measured routinely ( using very long baseline interferometry [ e.g. , @xcite ] for regular pulsars and `` timing '' parallaxes [ e.g. , @xcite ] for millisecond pulsars ) .",
    "furthermore , the astrometry shows that the space velocities of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  and rx  j1856.5@xmath03754  are typical for radio pulsars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the prospect for small improvements of the parallax are good , as a few measurements with a large time baseline will significantly constrain the proper motions of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  and the reference stars , which will improve the epoch registration , reduce the systematic uncertainties ( app .",
    "[ app : summary ] ) , and reduce the parallax uncertainty through its covariance with the proper motion and reference position ( table  [ tab : par ] ) . with such measurement , total ( statistical plus systematic ) uncertainties around 20% may be possible . to do much better",

    "while rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  has the poorer distance , in other ways the modeling is more constrained , since we know the spin period ( but see @xcite ) , have an estimate of its dipole magnetic field strength , and can use the variation with viewing geometry and the broad absorption feature in the x - ray spectrum @xcite .    at present , the most useful aspect of our measurement may be that they provide the necessary input for placing rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  on a cooling diagram ; previously , this was done with an erroneous spin - down age , which disagrees with our kinematic age and leads to the object appearing hotter than predicted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath336 , we also calculate the standard deviation for individual sources , @xmath337 and the same for @xmath50 . since @xmath338 is sometimes small for a given star , the standard deviation is not always a good estimator of the true uncertainty , but on average we have found that it is quite reasonable ( see   [ app : uncert ] and fig .",

    "one has to keep in mind that the transformation parameters and the average positions are not independent . in our case , the four brightest stars ( a , b , 118 , and 119 ) dominate the fit .",
    "these provide eight measurements per exposure ( 4 in each coordinate ) , but there are six free transformation parameters , and hence the fit will partly adjust to remove measurement errors . as a result ,",

    "of course , for the same reason , the standard deviations calculated using eq .  [ eq : sd ] will underestimate the true measurement uncertainties for the brightest stars .",
    "since we fit for all parameters at the same time , the above covariances are taken into account automatically .",
    "for instance , for star 119 , our fit yields errors @xmath341 on the average position similar to the input uncertainty @xmath336 for a single measurement ; this is a consequence of the fact that substantial variation in the average position can be compensated for by changes in the transformation parameters .",
    "in contrast , for fainter stars , we find @xmath342 , as one would expect for averaging @xmath338 exposures using a fixed transformation .",

[ eq : combchi2 ] ) , the only difference being that for the combination the positional parameters ( the average positions ) were independent of exposure number , while here there is a dependence on the time of each epoch ( eq .  [ eq : ad ] ) .",

    "we found that while our iterative solution was not biased , direct minimization was more precise , could more correctly disentangle the effects of stellar proper motions and uncertainties in @xmath349 , and found more easily the global @xmath48 minimum .",

    "we stress again , however , that these are not rigorous @xmath48 values , because the exposure parameters @xmath349 are common to all of the stars , and the @xmath48 for a single star does not take this into account ( similarly , @xmath348 are common to all of the epochs , and the @xmath48 for a single epoch does not take this into account ) . as for the combinations",
    ", this affects the brightest stars in particular ; from table  [ tab : ast ] , one indeed sees that stars a , b , 118 , and 119 have @xmath51 substantially below unity .",
    "we made a number of choices in determining the positions of stars in individual exposures and in combining these positions measurements . while we had reasons to prefer some schemes over others",
    ", we wished to verify that our final measurements did not depend on the detailed choices that we made .",
    "therefore , we present the consequences of different ways of measuring positions (   [ app : pos ] ) , estimating uncertainties (   [ app : uncert ] ) , identifying `` bad '' measurements (   [ app : rejection ] ) , and combining exposures into averages and fitting these to an astrometric model (   [ app : combination ] ) .",
    "we also discuss a few statistical tests of the robustness of our results (   [ app : jackknife ] ) and end with a summary of the possible sources of systematic error (   [ app : summary ] ) .",
    "we note that all of the steps in the analysis (   [ sec : hrc ] ,   [ sec : parallax ] , and app .",
    "[ app : ast ] ) were performed independently by two of us ( dlk and mhvk ) , using separate routines .",
    "we cross - checked the results at many points in the analysis , ensuring results were identical .      at the start of the project",
    ", we wished to see if the measurement scheme of ( appendix  c ) was optimal .",
    "we did a number of experiments , and settled on a slightly different scheme , described in ",
    "[ sec : hrc ] .",
    "overall , we found that , for our project , the choice of scheme had little influence : differences in the final parallax were less than 0.15  mas , and we find the same parallax also if we simply use the routines provided by and do careful rejection of outliers ( app .",
    "[ app : rejection ] ) .",
    "however , the differences may be important for brighter sources , and hence we briefly describe our experiments below .",
    "first , we varied the way pixels are weighted , taking into account only poisson noise , as in , also read - noise , or even a small , few percent `` flat - field '' error ( proportional to the flux ) .",
    "we found that using just read - out and poisson noise provided superior @xmath48 for the combination of exposures .",
    "we also tried determining weights based on the epsf model instead of the observed counts . here , using observed counts has the disadvantage that statistical fluctuation towards low ( high ) counts get too high ( low ) a weight ) , while using a model has the problem that , due to focus changes , etc . , the model may not be precise . the results , however , where not significantly different .",
    "second , we experimented with the fit region , trying the @xmath373  pixel box used by , smaller and larger boxes , as well as circular regions with a range of radii .",
    "overall , we found that circular regions gave slightly smaller residuals in combining exposures .",
    "we picked a radius of 2.56  pixels to minimize the dependence of the number of pixels in the region on centroid position ( the average number included is 20.6 , with a standard deviation of 0.7 ) .",
    "third , we tried determining the sky from annuli around sources , like do , including it in the fitting process , and fixing it globally to the header value ` mdrizsky ` .",
    "we found only slight differences ; our choice of a constant sky level was based on a slightly smaller  @xmath48 .",
    "fourth , we tried fitting for the epsf amplitude as well as fixing these amplitudes using the average photometry and an aperture correction for each exposure .",
    "it had minimal effect : using fixed amplitudes gave @xmath48 worse by a few percent in the combination and astrometry .",
    "we determined uncertainties in the positions from the @xmath48 fitting . to verify these",
    ", we simulated the detection of 10,000 stars of a range of brightnesses , and calculated standard deviations .",
    "this simulation included the effects of photon noise and read noise ( which dominate for the fainter stars ) , but did not include any mismatches in the epsf ( which will dominate for brighter stars ) .",
    "we find that the 1@xmath43 uncertainty in each coordinate can be described approximately by , @xmath374^{1/2}~{\\rm pixel } , \\label{eq : sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath375 with @xmath376 the counts in a @xmath373  pixel box ( or , equivalently , the epsf amplitude from the fit ) , and @xmath377 and @xmath378 are constants determined from the simulation .",
    "this relation roughly matches expectations , since the uncertainty should scale as the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) divided by the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , where the snr has contributions from poisson noise ( @xmath379 ; first term , which dominates for bright stars ) and read - noise ( @xmath380 ; second term , which dominates for faint stars ; here , @xmath381 is the read - noise in the pixels covered by the psf ) . with a gain of unity for flat - fielded images and a fwhm close to 1  pixel ,",
    "one expects @xmath382 , as we find .",
    "similarly , from the read - noise of @xmath383 per pixel , and considering that 20 pixels are used , one roughly reproduces  @xmath384 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : err ] , we compare the predictions with the standard deviations found after combination of the exposures ( eq .  [ eq : sd ] ) , and find good agreement .    for the brightest stars",
    ", one might expect that systematic effects to start to dominate , but from neither simulations nor observations do we find evidence for this ( fig .  [ fig : err ] ) , in contrast to what found for wfpc2 data , and what is found for hrc by .",
    "for the observations , however , one has to keep in mind that , for the brightest stars , the standard deviations underestimate the measurement uncertainty , since part of the measurement error has been absorbed in the transformations required to put the exposures on a single reference frame ( app .  [ app : ast ] ) .",
    "hence , any systematic error might be hidden in the transformations .    to test the effect of possible systematic errors , we added , in quadrature , constant terms of up to 0.01  pixel to our input uncertainties , thus reducing the weight carried by the brightest stars .",
    "as expected , the overall @xmath48 for the exposure combination and the astrometry decreases , from @xmath385 and @xmath386 to 0.89 and 0.81 , respectively . the change in parallax , however , is only 0.005  mas .",
    "we can use these results to estimate the size of the systematic errors , by determining for what additional systematic error one obtains @xmath387 .",
    "we find this is at about 0.007  pix , consistent with the results of .      during our analysis",
    ", we found that a very important part in obtaining a good registration is the rejection of measurements that are biased by a bad pixel or a cosmic ray .",
    "the scheme we used was meant to be as objective as possible , being based on identifying bad pixels in an entirely automatic way . yet",
    ", we still needed to reject some additional measurements (   [ sec : hrc ] ) .",
    "as an alternative , we identified bad measurements from large deviations of the positions and/or instrumental magnitudes of single observations from the average .",
    "we did not employ a formal rejection criterion but examined all of the data manually , iteratively registering the exposures and removing outliers .",
    "for the brightest four stars , very few exposures were rejected , while for the fainter ones we included on average 7  exposures per epoch . with this set , we derived a parallax very similar to our best value .",
    "we combine our individual measurements into averages using a six - parameter transformation between exposures , and again use a six - parameter transformation in our astrometric solution .",
    "although these choices are grounded in the work of , we tried some alternatives : ( i ) combining exposures with two or four - parameter transformations ; ( ii ) tying the epochs using a four - parameter transformation ; and ( iii ) instead of merging the exposures , treating each exposure as a separate epoch , and fit for 64 transformations @xmath388 simultaneously .",
    "we found that a different choice of combining the exposures did not change the final parallax significantly ( i.e. , by more than 0.1  mas ) , although it did affect the quality of the fit : with fewer parameters , the @xmath48 values were significantly higher .",
    "using only 4 parameters for the astrometric tie has a more drastic effect on the quality of the fit .",
    "the parallax , however , decreased by only 0.1  mas compared to our main result .",
    "when we treated all exposures as separate epochs , we found a parallax identical to within 0.01  mas with that derived using our two - stage approach .",
    "the fit was formally less good than our two - stage result , which may reflect an underestimate of the uncertainties of bright stars and/or remaining position measurements contaminated by cosmic rays .",
    "we made a number of experiments to address these issues , but , fortunately , the effects of all of them on the parallax is small , @xmath389  mas .",
    "as a statistical measure of the robustness of our result , we tried to `` jackknife '' our data , removing either one star or one epoch from the fit . removing",
    "a single star does not change the fit appreciably , showing that no single star dominates the fit . on average , there was no change in the parallax , and the dispersion was only 0.03  mas .",
    "the dispersion is dominated by one star , b : with b omitted , the parallax decreased by 0.1  mas ( note that b is also the most discrepant point in fig .",
    "[ fig : photpar ] ) . given how small this change",
    "is compared to the statistical uncertainty , we are satisfied with this test .    removing an epoch",
    "had a more dramatic effect .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : par ] , some epochs fit significantly better than others . specifically , removing epoch  5 improved the quality of the fit ( @xmath390 for the overall transformation ) , and increased the parallax to @xmath391  mas .",
    "in contrast , removing epoch  8 gave a less significant change in the quality of the fit ( @xmath392 ) , but a larger change in parallax , to @xmath393  mas .",
    "these were the most extreme examples : the mean shift was 0.08  mas , and the standard deviation was 0.5  mas ( 0.3  mas excluding the epoch  8 result ) .",
    "part of the problem with removing epoch  8 seems to be a covariance with the proper motion : while removing the other epochs changed the proper motion by @xmath394 , removing epoch  8 changed @xmath246 to @xmath395 ( the correlation coefficients between @xmath253 and @xmath396 or @xmath397 are significant ; see table  [ tab : par ] ) .",
    "finally , we also removed individual exposures when we fit using all of the exposures without combination ( app .  [ app : combination ] ) . again , the mean of the parallaxes was identical to that in table  [ tab : par ] , and the standard deviation was 0.1  mas .",
    "this leads to an uncertainty of 0.9  mas for the parallax ( following @xcite ) , which is the same as what we derived from error propagation .      the biggest source of systematic uncertainties that could affect our results are the epochs that we include .",
    "while the other choices , as described above , led to parallax differences of @xmath398  mas , the jackknife tests on epochs gave larger changes ( app .",
    "[ app : jackknife ] ) .",
    "overall , we believe our result from table  [ tab : par ] to be reliable , but we should add a systematic uncertainty to the statistical uncertainty quoted there .",
    "the magnitude of this uncertainty should be similar to the variation in the parallax that we see , or 0.4  mas .",
    "this may be an overestimate , as our exposure jackknife tests indicated that the bias was small , but we prefer to err on the conservative side .",
    "a small number of measurements in the future that will have a long enough time baseline to make the proper motion better determined should reduce this uncertainty significantly .",
