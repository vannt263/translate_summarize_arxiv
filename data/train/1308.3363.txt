    "most neurons in the brain communicate by emitting and receiving electrical pulses , called action potentials or spikes , via chemically operating synaptic connections .",
    "local cortical circuits often exhibit spiking dynamics that is highly irregular and appears as if it were random . such irregular activity at low neuronal firing rate is thus considered a basic `` ground state '' .",
    "it is characterized by individual neurons that display largely fluctuating membrane potentials and highly variable inter - spike - intervals ( isis ) as well as by low correlations between the neurons @xcite .",
    "originally , this dynamical state seemed to be in contradiction to cortical anatomy , where each neuron receives a huge number of synapses , typically @xmath0 @xcite : one might expect that a large number of uncorrelated , or weakly correlated synaptic inputs to one neuron , given the central limit theorem , sums up to a regular total input signal with only small relative fluctuations , therefore excluding the emergence of irregular dynamics .",
    "so the finding of highly irregular activity might be surprising .",
    "this issue was resolved by the idea of a `` balanced state '' @xcite , in which excitatory ( positive ) and inhibitory ( negative ) input balances such that the average membrane potential is sub - threshold and strong fluctuations once in a while are sufficiently depolarizing to initiate a spike .",
    "the original work `` chaos in neuronal networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory activity '' @xcite was an analysis of a self - consistent , highly irregular `` balanced '' activity for sparse random networks of binary model neurons .",
    "it was shown that the balanced state naturally and robustly occurs in large networks if the inhibitory and excitatory coupling strengths and their respective numbers of synapses appropriately scale with each other . moreover , flipping the state of only one of the binary neurons in a large network ( i.e. applying the smallest possible non - zero perturbation in such a system ) leads to a supra - exponential divergence between the perturbed and the unperturbed realizations of the network dynamics , exemplifying the extremely chaotic nature of the balanced activity @xcite .",
    "later analysis @xcite of networks of integrate - and - fire neurons demonstrated that the mean field description of the balanced activity for these continuous - state neuron networks is very similar to that of the original binary neuron networks .",
    "these and related results @xcite indicate that statistically the same balanced activity persists both in networks with external excitatory inputs and recurrent inhibition only as well as in networks with equal total amounts of recurrent inhibition and recurrent excitation .",
    "these findings about the robustness of the balanced state , the original work @xcite together with common intuition may suggest that highly irregular activity originates from chaotic network dynamics .",
    "this hypothesis , however , has not been systematically investigated so far .",
    "recent research even points towards the contrary : it shows that in globally coupled networks without delay the dynamics tends to converge to stable periodic orbits if inhibition dominates @xcite .",
    "numerical investigations of weakly diluted inhibitorily coupled networks without delay even show that although the dynamics may be irregular , its lyapunov exponent is negative @xcite .",
    "these numerical simulations also demonstrate by example that the dynamics converges to a periodic orbit after long quasi - stationary transients .",
    "interestingly , a related article @xcite also gives numerical evidence that there can be chaos and long transients even in networks with only inhibitory connections .    in this article",
    "we show analytically in the limit of fast synaptic response , that in inhibitory networks with inhomogeneous delay distribution and arbitrary , strongly connected topology ( a network is _ strongly connected _ if there is a directed path of connections between any ordered pair of neurons . )",
    "any generic trajectory is asymptotically stable .",
    "after a ( typically long ) stable transient characterized by irregular activity the dynamics converges to a periodic orbit that is also stable , in agreement with the results presented in @xcite .",
    "in particular the transients are not chaotic in contrast to the ones occurring in purely excitatorily coupled networks @xcite .",
    "we show that this collective dynamics is robust upon increasing the synaptic response time from zero and upon replacing some inhibitory by excitatory interactions .",
    "nevertheless , if the synaptic response becomes too slow or the number of excitatory interaction too large , the collective dynamics becomes chaotic via a transition where the lyapunov exponent changes smoothly and the spiking activity stays highly irregular .",
    "thus the irregularity equally prevails in networks with stable as well as in networks with chaotic dynamics , leaving no evidence that chaos generates the irregularity .",
    "some analytically accessible aspects of the stable irregular dynamics have been briefly reported before @xcite .",
    "parts of this work have been presented in @xcite and at a bernstein symposium @xcite .",

    "irregular spiking activity that robustly arises in balanced state models , constitutes a generic feature of cortical dynamics . here , for a class of models including e.g.  the common leaky integrate - and - fire neuron",

    "for small sparse networks we showed that the dynamics even converges to a periodic orbit .",
    "however , the length of the irregular yet stable transient grows rapidly with network size such that for larger networks , in particular for biological relevant sizes , transients dominate the dynamics on all relevant time scales .",
    "furthermore , we found that the phenomenon of stable yet irregular dynamics is robust against introducing some excitatory interactions or against increasing the synaptic time scales from zero .",
    "if the synaptic responses become too slow or excitatory interactions too many , we revealed a smooth transition from stable irregular dynamics to chaotic , equally irregular dynamics .",
    "we emphasize that we kept the network rate during this transition ( and thus keep the balance ) and that the mean field descriptions @xcite of networks in both regimes are identical when the parameters are suitably chosen . thus , highly irregular spiking dynamics occurs independent of the stability properties of the network .",
    "earlier studies on balanced neural activity considered a priori the limit of infinitely many neurons in sparse networks @xcite . in this mean field limit the collective dynamics is well understood .",
    "in particular in infinitely large networks of binary neurons with balanced excitatory and inhibitory interactions the dynamics are chaotic @xcite .",

    "recent analytical evidence confirmed the existence of stable dynamics in inhibitory coupled networks of integrate - and - fire neurons with a more complex structure @xcite .",
    "as the inter - event times that underly our analysis shrink inversely proportional to the network size ( at a given individual neuron - spiking - rate ) , the methods applied here , however , are not applicable in a straightforward way in associated mean field models .",
    "thus , one can not make strict statements about stability in the limit of infinitely many neurons .",
    "nevertheless , as shown above , generic transients and periodic trajectories in arbitrarily large inhibitory coupled networks are stable .    taken together , the results show that the microscopic dynamics in purely inhibitory coupled networks differs substantially from the dynamics of networks that explicitly include excitatory couplings . whereas the latter is chaotic , the former is completely different and generically stable - despite both showing the same irregularity features .",
    "in particular , chaotic as well as stable dynamics are equally well capable of generating highly irregular spiking activity .",
    "the smoothness of the transition to chaos , without essential change of the irregularity ( e.g.  of the large coefficients of variation ) further suggests that chaos is not the main dynamical origin of the high irregularity .",
    "we thus suggest that a mechanism different from chaos contributes to the irregularity of cortical firing patterns in a substantial way .",
    "moreover , the location of the transition from chaos to stability as well as the dynamical mechanism underlying this transition , remain unknown",
    ".    nevertheless , chaos as well as stochastic network properties such as unreliable synapses , may support the robust occurrence of irregular activity in cortical networks and also modify its computational features .",

    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate that after long transients the dynamics converges towards periodic orbits and that every generic periodic orbit of these dynamical systems is stable . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the collective irregular dynamics upon increasing the time scale of synaptic responses and upon iteratively replacing inhibitory by excitatory interactions . </S>",
    "<S> whereas for small and moderate time scales as well as for few excitatory interactions , the dynamics stays stable , there is a smooth transition to chaos if the synaptic response becomes sufficiently slow ( even in purely inhibitory networks ) or the number of excitatory interactions becomes too large . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that chaotic and stable dynamics are equally capable of generating the irregular neuronal activity . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , chaos apparently is not essential for generating high irregularity of balanced activity , and we suggest that a mechanism different from chaos and stochasticity significantly contributes to irregular activity in cortical circuits . </S>"
