    "the proton - antiproton annihilation experiment panda , which is planned for the fair facility at gsi , is scheduled to begin data taking in the beginning of the next decade .",
    "panda is an internal fixed target experiment , with a design luminosity of @xmath10 @xmath11s@xmath12 and a momentum range of p@xmath13-@xmath14 gev / c .",
    "this covers a mass range in which many interesting hadron resonances are anticipated , including glueballs , light hybrids , charmonia and charmonium hybrids @xcite .",
    "the physics goals of panda include a detailed investigation of the spectrum of charmonia and charmonium hybrids , including determinations of masses , widths , quantum numbers and decay properties .",
    "since the known charmonium spectrum is largely characterized by clear , well separated states , unlike the broad , overlapping resonances of light quark hadron spectroscopy , it is anticipated that this will be a relatively clean sector in which to search for higher - mass excitations such as hybrids and other unusual hadron resonances .",
    "studies of conventional meson spectroscopy using proton - antiproton collisions have a considerable advantage over electron - positron colliders , in that _ all _ nonexotic quantum numbers can be accessed in formation reactions . although @xmath15-exotics can not be made in formation in @xmath16 annihilation , they can be made in associated production processes such as @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is a @xmath15-exotic charmonium hybrid ) .",
    "production of the very characteristic @xmath15-exotic charmonium hybrids is one of the main goals of the panda project .",
    "these states are predicted to lie at rather high masses ; the @xmath19 state , which is expected to be the lightest exotic charmonium hybrid , is predicted by the flux tube model @xcite and lattice qcd @xcite to have a mass in the range 4.2 - 4.4 gev .",
    "this exotic resonance could be produced at panda together with a light meson @xmath1 , such as an @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "( both isospins are allowed in @xmath22 because @xmath16 is a superposition of i=0 and i=1 . )",
    "numerical estimates of charmonium and charmonium hybrid production cross sections are evidently crucial for the panda physics program , both to formulate detection strategies and to evaluate luminosity requirements , as well as for detailed detector simulations with theoretically preferred final states .",
    "unfortunately there are few estimates of these cross sections at present , and only one has been measured , @xmath23 .",
    "( this result was reported by the e760 collaboration @xcite . )",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive and evaluate simple estimates of these cross sections from measurements of charmonium partial widths to @xmath24 three - body final states .",
    "the approach we follow in this paper is to use a measured charmonium partial width into a three - body @xmath25 final state , @xmath26 , to estimate the corresponding production cross section @xmath27 .",
    "the ( presumably complicated ) quark - gluon dynamics is subsumed in the unknown amplitude @xmath28 , which is common to both processes .",
    "the three - body partial width of an initial charmonium state @xmath2 is an average over initial and sum over final polarizations of a squared decay amplitude , multiplied by three - body phase space .",
    "the differential decay rate , in the form familiar as a dalitz plot , is @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the spin of particle @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the invariant mass squared of the two - particle system @xmath34 @xcite , and the squared amplitude in this formula is summed over all @xmath35 initial and final polarization states .",
    "( this summation convention is convenient for relating decays to cross sections . )    as a simple approximation one can assume a constant decay amplitude @xmath28 , in which case the decay width is proportional to the area @xmath36 of the dalitz plot ; @xmath37 where @xmath38      . ]    in the unpolarized two - body production cross section the squared amplitude is again averaged over initial and summed over final states .",
    "the unpolarized differential cross section is given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mandelstam variable @xmath42 .",
    "a factor of 1/4 has been included for the average over the four initial @xmath16 polarization states .",
    "the total cross section involves an integral over @xmath41 between the limits t _ = m_p^2 + m_m^2 - 2 ( e_pe_m p_p p_m)_cm . assuming a constant amplitude we can trivially evaluate this integral , with the result",
    "_ p|pm = s^-1 \\ { ||^2 } .",
    "[ eq : cross ]      the partial width @xmath26 and the production cross section @xmath27 given above are simply related in the constant amplitude approximation , since both are given by simple kinematic and spin factors times the same spin - summed squared amplitude . eliminating the common squared amplitude , we find the following relation between the cross section and decay width : _",
    "p|pm= 4 ^ 2 ( 2s_+1 ) _",
    "[ eq : connect ] note that in this approximation all the energy dependence in the cross section comes from the expression in square brackets .",
    "a similar approach has been used to estimate charmonium cross sections of relevance to qgp experiments  @xcite .",
    "the estimate of the charmonium production cross sections @xmath44 in eq.([eq : connect ] ) requires the three body decay partial widths @xmath45 .",
    "these branching fractions ( and hence partial widths ) have been measured for about 10 @xmath24 decay modes to date , all from @xmath46 or @xmath47 initial states at @xmath48 colliders .",
    "pdg values for the branching fractions are given in table  [ tab : widths ] .",
    "since the pdg compilation , new measurements of @xmath46 and @xmath47 branching fractions to @xmath49 have been reported by besii @xcite and cleo - c @xcite ; these are summarized in table  [ tab : widthsnew ] .",
    "unfortunately , branching fractions of @xmath50 charmonia to @xmath49 final states have not yet been reported .",
    "results for c = @xmath51 states such as the @xmath52 and @xmath53 would be very interesting , as these may couple to @xmath49 through a different mechanism than c = @xmath54 charmonia , perhaps with significantly larger amplitudes .",
    "this possibility is suggested by the known four - body partial widths to @xmath55 , which are larger on average for the @xmath56 states than for the @xmath46 and @xmath47 .      the only previous estimate of near - threshold associated charmonium production cross sections we have found in the literature is the pcac calculation of gaillard , maiani and petronzio @xcite .",
    "this reference considers the process @xmath57 , where @xmath2 is a generic charmonium state , and notes that the cross section is proportional to the peak on - resonance cross section for @xmath58 if one assumes that pion emission in the decay takes place from the @xmath59 or @xmath60 line in a two - step process , @xmath61 .",

    "using eq.([eq : connect ] ) and the partial widths given in tables  [ tab : widths ] and [ tab : widthsnew ] , we have generated constant amplitude estimates for @xmath86 for all cases with measured @xmath2 partial widths to @xmath49 final states .",
    "the @xmath46 cross section estimates use pdg branching fractions and decay widths , and the @xmath47 cross sections were calculated using besii branching fractions for @xmath87 and @xmath20 and cleo - c branching fractions for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "the observed events correspond to a cross section of @xmath98 just below 3.525  gev and @xmath99 at 3.61  gev .",
    "this has also been quoted as a combined value of @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the e760 measurements are shown in fig.[fig : csec ] together with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the constant amplitude cross section of eq.([eq : connect ] ) is also shown in fig.[fig : csec ] .",
    "this approximation predicts @xmath101 at 3.52  gev and @xmath102 at 3.61  gev , which overestimates the cross section at these energies by about a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "this suggests that the constant amplitude approximation is useful as a first estimate , but should be improved through a more detailed description of the amplitude , for example by incorporating the contributions of individual resonances to the decay dalitz plot .",
    "the importance of baryon resonances in this decay and in related @xmath4 decays has been discussed previously in both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite references .    .",
    "the theoretical predictions are the constant amplitude result eq.([eq : connect ] ) ( solid ) and the range of pcac cross sections , from eq.([eq : pcac_csec ] ) ( filled ) .",
    "the experimental points are from e760 @xcite . ]",
    "the pcac result for the cross section for @xmath103 , eq.([eq : pcac_csec ] ) , is also shown in fig.[fig : csec ] .",
    "here we have assumed ( rounded ) pdg values of @xmath104 and @xmath105  gev , pdg masses and widths , and a peak on - resonance cross section of @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "since the result depends on the initial @xmath16 quantum numbers assumed , we show the full set of values that follow from the range @xmath107 in eq.([eq : pcac_sigma ] ) .",
    "evidently this pcac prediction is also somewhat larger than the experimental e760 cross section in the 3.5 - 3.6 gev region where we have data , and is rather similar to the constant amplitude result near threshold .",
    "the disagreement of pcac with experiment may simply imply that other important processes interfere destructively with the nucleon pole diagram .",
    "our constant amplitude predictions for all @xmath108 cross sections are summarized in table  [ tab : calculations ] .",
    "the @xmath109 cross sections are typically predicted to be 10s of @xmath110 , at least an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding @xmath46 cross sections .",
    "there is no indication of an enhancement of isoscalar @xmath1 final states in this case .",
    "although the @xmath47 couplings are relatively weak , the decay @xmath111 ( and the corresponding reaction @xmath112 ) may be the most interesting to study in the near future .",
    "as is evident in fig.[fig : dalitz2 ] , the region of phase space sampled by this decay is much larger than in @xmath113 , so more baryon resonance contributions can be investigated , and their effects on the extrapolation to the physical region for @xmath112 can be studied once data on this reaction becomes available .",
    "besii @xcite has recently reported results on this @xmath47 decay mode .",
    "0.8 cm     and @xmath114 . the smaller physical region for @xmath115",
    "is shown for comparison ( dashed , from fig.[fig : dalitz1 ] ) . ]",
    "it is notable that quite large maximum cross sections of @xmath116-@xmath117 are predicted for @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "this suggests that it may be interesting for panda to consider reactions in which @xmath1 is a light isoscalar meson .",
    "this is also supported by the relatively large branching fractions observed for charmonium decays to @xmath120 .",
    "although an enhancement of @xmath121 cross sections with light isoscalar @xmath1 is an interesting possibility , one should note that the dalitz plot for the decay @xmath122 ( as one example ) is crossed by n@xmath123 bands ( fig.[fig : dalitz3 ] ) , and this baryon resonance contribution may be the reason for the large branching fraction .",
    "this is supported by results from besii @xcite .",
    "as these n@xmath123 bands lie far outside the physical region for @xmath124 , it appears likely that the constant amplitude approximation eq.([eq : connect ] ) will seriously overestimate this cross section .",
    "1.0 cm     and @xmath125 , showing n@xmath123 bands .",
    "( m@xmath126 limits are shown . ) ]",
    "we have used the partial decay widths of charmonia into @xmath49 final states ( where @xmath1 is a light meson ) and a constant amplitude approximation to estimate cross sections for the reactions @xmath39 , which are of great interest for the planned panda experiment .",
    "the single experimentally measured cross section of this type is @xmath91 , which was reported by e760 to be @xmath6 near 3.5 - 3.6 gev . in comparison",
    "we predict a cross section of about @xmath127  @xmath128 at this energy .",
    "application of this constant amplitude approximation to other @xmath129 reactions suggests enhanced peak cross sections of as large as 1 - 3  @xmath110 for light isoscalar @xmath1 .",
    "this prediction may however be an artifact of large baryon resonance contributions to these specific @xmath130 decays .",
    "these resonances need not contribute significantly to the production cross section if the decay resonance bands lie far from that region of phase space ( see for example fig.[fig : dalitz3 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath47 decays do not show evidence of an enhancement of isosinglet @xmath1 final states ; the estimated @xmath131 cross sections are 10s of @xmath110 .",
    "a next important step in these calculations will be to model the contributions of individual baryon resonances to the decays .",
    "in low - energy processes involving a single @xmath21 , such as @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( fig.[fig : dalitz1 ] ) , one may find dominance of the decay dalitz plot by a few baryon resonances .",
    "in such cases , extrapolation of the amplitude to the reaction region may be relatively straightforward .",
    "studies of the corresponding @xmath47 processes may be instructive , since the region of phase space accessible to the decay is much larger ( fig.[fig : dalitz2 ] ) , and new data is expected from besii and cleo - c .",
    "in contrast , relating decays and production cross sections for heavier mesons such as the @xmath20 is clearly problematic , since the decay dalitz plot provides a smaller window on the amplitude , and the extrapolation from decay to production covers a much larger kinematic range ( fig.[fig : dalitz3 ] ) . for vector mesons such as the @xmath89 we encounter the additional complication that the couplings of baryon resonances to @xmath89n are not well established .",
    "the n@xmath134 experimental program at tjnaf , which has a goal of determining these @xmath89n and related baryon resonance decay couplings , may also be useful in interpreting @xmath4 decays and clarifying their relation to charmonium production cross sections .",
    "future measurements of @xmath49 branching fractions of c  =  ( + ) charmonia such as the @xmath135 and @xmath52 will be especially interesting , as these will allow estimates of their @xmath108 production cross sections . as c",
    "=  ( + ) charmonia employ different production mechanisms than the c = ( @xmath136 ) states , for example @xmath137 rather than @xmath138 intermediaries , they may have quite different production cross sections .",
