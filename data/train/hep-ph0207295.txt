    "it is clear that as long as the evolution is linear from the radiation era , non - gaussianity can arise only from an `` initial '' non - gaussianity generated during inflation .",
    "simple calculations , that we reproduce in the second section of this paper , however show that within single field inflationary framework it is not possible to produce primordial non - gaussian fluctuations if the slow - roll conditions are preserved throughout the inflationary period during which the seeds of the large - scale structures are generated . non - gaussianity can be generated only if the inflation starts from a non - vacuum initial state  @xcite or if there exist sharp features in the shape of the potential  @xcite , but it in the latter case it clearly shows up in the density fluctuation power spectrum .",
    "it has been noticed however that the situation is somewhat changed when more than one light scalar field are present during inflation . in this case",
    "it is to be noticed first that one generically produces a mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations  @xcite that can be uncorrelated or correlated  @xcite .",
    "the observational consequences of the existence of these two types of modes have started to be considered  @xcite but they clearly depend on which type of matter each of the field decays to",
    ". multi - field inflation also opens the door to the generation of non - gaussianity simply because the non - linear couplings can be much stronger in the isocurvature direction than in the adiabatic direction  @xcite .",
    "for instance in models in which a peccei - quinn symmetry is broken during inflation , it was pointed out by allen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that a fourth order derivative term in the effective theory leads to non - gaussianity in the axion density . in the `` seed '' models including @xmath0  @xcite , axion  @xcite , goldstone bosons  @xcite and topological defects  @xcite models ,",
    "there is a test scalar field that is a pure perturbation and that does not contribute to the background energy density ; the energy being quadratic in the field , it induces non - gaussianity in the perturbations . in such models however the non - gaussian features are present in the isocurvature modes only and",
    "will be observationally relevant only if those modes survive the reheating phase .",
    "the phenomenological situation is somewhat different however if a transfer of the modes is possible , that is when the fields are coupled  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore to explore whether in the context of multi field inflation it is possible to generate non - gaussian features while preserving the adiabatic slow - roll type power spectrum and what would be its observational signature .",
    "we are obviously motivated by the development of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structures observations that offer an opportunity reconstruct the properties of the primordial metric perturbations .",
    "primordial fluctuations are more directly probed by cmb observations but then the number of modes that can be measured is still small . up to now , no non - gaussian signature has been detected in either the 4 year cobe data  @xcite or the 1 year maxima data  @xcite . in large - scale structure surveys the number of independent modes one can observe is large but the difficulty is that the non - linear gravitational dynamics  @xcite generates non - gaussian couplings that can shadow the primordial ones  @xcite .",
    "one should then rely on a good understanding of the impact of the gravitational dynamics on the observations .",
    "cosmic shear surveys might offer one of the most serious opportunity to explore such effects in the coming years  @xcite .",
    "we start ( section  [ 0 ] ) by a general overview of the generation of non - gaussianity in single and multi - field inflation .",
    "it will lead us to define a mechanism that can produce such non - gaussianity . in section  [ i ] , we then consider the evolution of perturbations in two - field inflation and summarize how isocurvature perturbation can be transferred to the adiabatic component when the trajectory in the field space is curved .",
    "the isocurvature mode develops non - gaussianity due to self - interaction ; we study in section  [ ii ] the evolution of such a self - interacting field in an expanding universe . after having posed the problem for a quantum scalar field in an inflationary background",
    "we address this issue from a classical point of view . in section  [ iii ] and",
    "[ pdf properties ] , we compute the probability distribution function that can be obtained in the class of models considered in this article .",
    "as explained in the introduction , our goal is to design a model that can produce sufficiently large non - gaussianity at least for a band @xmath1 $ ] of wavelengths observationally relevant , i.e. that corresponds to the large scale structure scales . to guide us in this task , we review the properties of non - gaussianity in single field and multi - field inflation models in order to determine whether they fulfill our requirements",
    ". + let us start by considering a single field , @xmath2 , in slow - roll inflation .",
    "the klein - gordon equation for its perturbation is of the form @xmath3 during the slow - roll regime , @xmath4 and @xmath5 so that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the reduced planck mass , and the slow - roll conditions can be expressed as @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 in order for the fluctuations of the scalar field to be large enough , one needs the mass of the field to be much smaller than @xmath11 , in which case one gets @xmath12 . to get the correct amplitude for the primordial fluctuations , one needs @xmath13 so that @xmath14 the band of wavelengths @xmath1 $ ] corresponding to large scale structures exits the hubble radius during the @xmath15-folds @xmath16 during which the slow - roll parameter @xmath17 has varied as @xmath18 , with @xmath19 . from eq .",

    "this will induce a rapid breakdown of the slow - roll inflation .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the potential has to be both flat enough for the fluctuations to develop and steep enough for the non - linear terms not to be negligible .",
    "a way round to this argument is to consider potential with a sharp feature  @xcite but in that case the non - gaussianity is associated with a departure from scale invariance and is located in a very small band of wavelengths .",
    "+ thus , one requires at least one auxiliary field . as a second situation",
    "let us consider the case in which this auxiliary field does not interact with the inflaton so that the potential has the form @xmath23 so that the cosmological evolution drives @xmath24 towards the minimum of its potential @xmath25 .",
    "it follows that the lowest order contribution to its energy density perturbation is not given by the standard expression @xmath26 but one has to go to quadratic order .",
    "thus , even if the klein - gordon equation is linear , the energy density of the field will develop non - gaussianities with a @xmath0 statistics and with @xmath27 .",

    "the klein - gordon equation ( [ ov:1 ] ) now has two source terms @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "the only new contribution is of order @xmath72 and is thus negligible compared to the contribution arising from @xmath73 .",
    "as in the previous example , the self - interaction term will also turn out to be negligible . as a conclusion ,",
    "such a potential will give rise to non - gaussianities sourced by the coupling to the inflaton perturbation .",
    "in such a scenario , the field @xmath24 develops its non - gaussianities due to non - linear evolution and these non - gaussianities are transferred to the inflaton field due to the coupling source term in its klein - gordon equation .",

    "the first contribution is @xmath77 ; either @xmath78 and the fluctuation of @xmath24 will be negligible or @xmath79 and one needs to consider next terms .",
    "if the cubic term is dominant then the trajectory @xmath74 is unstable . now if it is either negligible with the quartic order or of the same order , the latter situation resulting in the fine tuning @xmath80 . for the following @xmath81 terms",

    "this is the only term for which the non - gaussian fluctuations can develop on a long time scale without any tuning to @xmath11 .",
    "this naturality arguments lead us to expect the most efficient and only relevant term to consider is an auxiliary field self - interacting with a quartic potential , @xmath88 , and coupled to the inflaton",
    ".    the sketch of the scenario will thus be the following .",
    "the auxiliary field develops non - gaussianities .",
    "the bundle of field trajectories in the field space @xmath89 is deformed when the potential minimum is bent . according to the sign of @xmath90 , it is focalized ( @xmath91 ) or defocalized ( @xmath92 ) and the section of the bundle is deformed , as depicted on figure  [ focus ] ( this completely analogous to the deformation of the section of bundle of light propagating in a gravitational field ) .",
    "neighboring trajectories have different lengths so that the fluctuations along each of the trajectories will be slightly different .    to formalize this scenario , we describe in more details the coupling and transfer between adiabatic and isocurvature modes . to characterize the non - gaussianity",
    ", one will need to treat the behavior of the quantum fluctuation before hubble scale crossing .",
    "but , the trajectories after hubble scale crossing can be treated classically and the classical contribution is expected to dominate over the quantum one if the bending occurs late enough after hubble scale crossing .",

    "we will make this hypothesis in the following .",
    "it clearly implies , as we anticipated in part  [ 0 ] , that the amplitude of the first order corrective term is given by the amplitude of the source term @xmath206 divided by @xmath39 times the number of @xmath15-fold during which the non linear couplings are active",
    ".    the existence of such corrective terms are obviously of importance for the statistical properties of the field . if the source term contains nonlinear couplings the field @xmath194 is no more gaussian .",
    "such properties should be exhibited in the high order correlation function of the field .",
    "exploring these consequences is the aim of the next section .",
    "as seen from the previous analysis , nothing prevents the isocurvature modes to develop non - gaussian properties on super - hubble scales .",
    "as stressed before , if the time between hubble radius crossing and the exchange of modes is large enough , the properties of those modes will be determined by their stochastic evolution at super - hubble scale , not so much by the quantum state with which the field modes reach super - hubble scales . in other words",
    "we expect the high order correlation functions present in the quantum field to be finally superseeded by the ones induced by the subsequent stochastic couplings .",
    "the aim of this section is then to characterize the way the non - gaussian features in the isocurvature modes are built up .",
    "there are obviously many ways of characterizing non - gaussian features in a stochastic field .",
    "the simplest approach is to consider the shape of the one - point probability distribution of the local field value .",
    "this series depends obviously in the type of couplings one has . for the reasons",
    "previously detailed , we will consider only the case of quartic couplings .",
    "in the first part of this section (   [ sec : cumulant4 ] ) we show how it is possible to compute any of such cumulants at leading order in the coupling constant ( that would correspond to tree - order calculation in a quantum field formulation ) .",
    "it finally leads to the expression of the generating function of the one - point cumulants  (   [ sec : cumulants ] ) .    to get insights into the physical interpretation of the previous results we then present (   [ subb ] ) the derivation of a quantity more directly related to observations : the one - point pdf of the local field value .",
    "not surprisingly we will see that the rare event tails of those distribution differs from those expected for a gaussian distribution .",
    "depending on the sign of the quartic coupling , one expects an excess or a deficit of rare values .",

    "we then consider the evolution equation ( [ dslevol ] ) with @xmath210 at this stage it should be noted that when using the @xmath194 field in the source term , one neglects the effects of the small scale fluctuations in the field trajectory .",
    "this is of no consequence for tree order calculations , however , _ no loop terms , that involve arbitrarily small scales fluctuations , can be reliably computed from this approach_. if one wants to do that one should solve the full quantum problem . in this study",
    "we allow ourselves to use this simplification but forbid ourselves to compute correlation properties beyond tree order .",
    "as said before in the absence of coupling the free field solution @xmath211 is time independent .",
    "this is not the case of higher order terms .",
    "for instance from eq .",
    "( [ dsl1solnr ] ) , we know that for this coupling term , @xmath212 ^ 3\\over h^2},\\ ] ] a term which induces non - gaussian properties in the field . in case of a quartic coupling the value of @xmath194 remains symmetric distributed so that the third order cumulant is always zero .",
    "the first non - vanishing high order cumulant is then the fourth one .",
    "its value can be computed at leading order ( in the coupling constant ) from the expression of @xmath200 . indeed",
    "the fourth order cumulant is formally given by , @xmath213 ^ 4\\rg-3\\lg \\left[\\dsl^{(0)}+\\dsl^{(1)}+\\dots\\right]^2\\rg^2,\\ ] ] replacing @xmath194 by its expansion in the coupling constant , eq .",

    "all higher order terms in the expression of @xmath194 contribute only at higher order in @xmath90 to this cumulant , and they would correspond to loop term corrections , e.g. fig .",
    "[ phi4c ] .",
    "however if one wishes to compute the expression of higher order cumulants , such as the sixth order one , the higher order terms in the expansion of @xmath194 will then contribute ( still at tree order ! ) , see fig .",
    "[ phi6c ] . in the next subsection",
    "we explore in more details the mathematical structure of the cumulant hierarchy .      to get insights in how the leading order expression can be computed , it is useful to consider one where terms of various order in the expansion of @xmath194 are mixed together .    for instance",
    "the sixth order cumulant is , at leading order in @xmath90 , given by @xmath218 ^ 2\\left[\\dsl^{(0)}\\right]^4\\rg_c+ 6\\,\\lg\\dsl^{(2)}\\left[\\dsl^{(0)}\\right]^5\\rg_c\\ ] ] since @xmath219 scales like @xmath220 ^ 5 $ ] .",

    "is determined by the consequences of the wick theorem applied to @xmath211 .",
    "it will therefore be of the form , @xmath221 where all the decompositions are such that @xmath222 so that it is possible to connect all terms together and no loop can be built [ @xmath223 is two times the number of lines required to connect @xmath83 points ] .    in order to manipulate dimensionless numbers we introduce the ( time dependent ) vertices , @xmath224^{2p+1}}.\\ ] ] for instance @xmath225 then the high order cumulants can be rewritten as @xmath226\\ \\lg \\left[\\dsl^{(0)}\\right]^2\\rg^{n-1}\\ ] ] that appear to be identical to tree sums in which the @xmath227-leg vertices are @xmath228 .",
    "the general computation of the @xmath228 is still a difficult task since it requires the resolution of the evolution equation for @xmath194 .",
    "actually if the time after hubble scale crossing is large enough then the first term of the equation is finally negligible so that the evolution equation actually reads , @xmath229 unlike the full evolution equation this equation has a simple solution given by , @xmath230^{-2}=\\left[\\dsl^{(0)}\\right]^{-2}-{\\lambda\\,(t - t_{\\rm h})\\over 36\\,h}\\ ] ] the time dependence of which can be rewritten as a function @xmath231 , @xmath232 ^ 2/3}}.\\ ] ] where @xmath211 is the ( time independent ) value of @xmath194 at hubble scale crossing . it is to be noted that the direct use of this relation to compute the high order moments of @xmath194 is unjustified because it automatically introduces loop terms in the computations .",
    "as these terms can not be reliably computed we restrict ourselves in the following to tree order terms .",
    "we can also note that if @xmath233 is positive there is a singularity at finite distance which would make all moment values infinite in this case .",
    "this pathological behavior is due to the fact that on rare occasions , the field value @xmath194 moves at arbitrarily large distance from the origin in a potential which is unbounded from below .",
    "this instability is due to the description of the potential we use around the trajectory and is not necessarily physical .",
    "once again if one limits ourself to tree order computations this issue is automatically solved ; all cumulants are finite are tree order .",
    "this calculation rules provides us with a natural regularization scheme .    a convenient way to describe",
    "what we have obtained is to write the fourth order cumulant , in units of the second order moment , @xmath234 the sixth order cumulant can similarly be expressed as a function of @xmath233 and @xmath235 @xmath236 in general the cumulant of order @xmath237 scales like @xmath238 to the power @xmath239 with a ratio given by a sum of product of vertices .",

    "in this paper we have explored the possibility of generating significant non - gaussian initial metric perturbations in the context of inflationary cosmology while preserving a power spectrum of slow roll type adiabatic fluctuations .",
    "we found that the only viable mechanism is through a multiple field inflation where transverse ( e.g. isocurvature ) modes developed non gaussian properties that can be subsequently transferred to the adiabatic fluctuations if the classical field trajectory is bent .",
    "we have pointed out that quartic type coupling in the transverse modes is the most natural type of couplings for providing non - gaussianities in the sense that in this case no fine - tuning in the value of the coupling constant has to be invoked .",
    "we stress that in the context of such a mechanism , unlike any others , the amount of non - gaussianities that can be fuelled in the adiabatic fluctuations can be almost arbitrarily large .",
    "we have examined in more details the case where the isocurvature mode generation ( that is when they reach the hubble size during the inflationary period ) and the adiabatic - isocurvature mode mixing happen at very different time .",

    "second it implies that the non - gaussian properties of the isocurvature modes developed mainly during the time they live at super - hubble scales .",

    "it is then possible to pursue the calculations to completion in the sense that it is possible to derive their whole set of correlation properties .",
    "in particular we have been able to derive the one - point field cumulants at tree order in the weak coupling limit in a consistent way and finally build up the one - point probability distribution function of the field value .",

    "the non - gaussian component is fully characterized by a single parameter , @xmath233 , related to the reduced fourth order connected cumulant and has the same variance as the gaussian contribution .",
    "for practical purposes , we emphasize that its pdf is well approximated by eq .",
    "( [ pdfapprox ] ) that reproduces accurately the numerically computed pdf within our approximation scheme .",
    "thus , all the statistical properties can be encapsuled in two parameters .",
    "these results give some insights on what type of non - gaussian features can appear in future large - scale structure or cmb surveys while assuming the inflationary prejudice .",
    "note that the kind of non - gaussianity described here departs from that generated by the non - linear gravitational dynamics , in particular it has no skewness .",
    "there is still however some ways between these results and their observational consequences .",
    "how non - gaussian properties that are present at super - hubble scales are transferred for instance to the cmb anisotropies at sub - hubble scales is not totally straightforward . whether such effects could be actually observed when observational aspects are taken into account demands in - depth analysis",
