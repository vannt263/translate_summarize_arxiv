    "mechanical resonators  @xcite have important applications in high precision displacement detection  @xcite , mass detection  @xcite , quantum measurements  @xcite , and studies of quantum behavior of either mechanical motion  @xcite or phonons  @xcite .",
    "recently , proposals  @xcite have been made for implementing qubits by using buckling nanoscale bars with quantized motion .",
    "casimir effects on nanoscale mechanical device were also studied  @xcite . however , in previous studies ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) of quantized mechanical resonators ( and macroscopic quantum phenomena  @xcite in mechanical resonators , see , e.g. , refs .  ) , it is necessary to prepare the mechanical resonators into their vibrational ground states .",
    "therefore , one needs to cool the mechanical resonators down to ultra - low temperatures to put them into their ground states .",
    "for example , a temperature below one milli - kevin is necessary for cooling a 20 mhz mechanical resonator to its vibrational ground state .    to reach temperatures below one milli - kelvin , which is beyond the capability of present dilution refrigerators , alternative",
    "cooling mechanisms are now being explored .",
    "using optomechanical couplings , the cooling of mechanical resonators was recently demonstrated experimentally  @xcite . to observe the quantized motion of a mechanical resonator",
    ", one should be able to cool the mechanical resonator down to its ground state of vibration and to detect the phonon number state . besides optomechanical cooling ,",
    "electronic cooling  @xcite was also studied . for instance , theoretical proposals for cooling a mechanical resonator were considered by coupling it either to a two - level system  @xcite , to an ion  @xcite or to an lc circuit  @xcite .",
    "an experimental demonstration of cooling a mechanical resonator by the quantum back - action of a superconducting single - electron transistor was recently reported  @xcite .",
    "most of these cooling experiments ( e.g. , refs .  ) focus on cooling mechanical resonators with a frequency lower than 1 mhz , with a mechanical quality factor higher than @xmath0 .",
    "it is difficult to experimentally cool mechanical resonators to their quantum ground state of vibrations because of the weak coupling between the mechanical resonators and the cooling media for optomechanical systems ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "recently , the strong coupling between a one dimensional ( 1d ) transmission line resonator ( tlr ) and a solid state qubit  @xcite was achieved  @xcite , and the detection of photon number states was also demonstrated  @xcite . based on these experimental developments , here",
    "we consider replacing the fabry - prot cavity used in previous cooling proposals  @xcite by a 1d tlr , in order to cool a micron - scale bar .",
    "the working mechanism of our proposal here is similar to the cooling of a tiny mirror in a fabry - prot cavity  @xcite .",
    "this cooling mechanism can be summarized as follows .",
    "a force on the mirror is coupled to the light intensity inside the cavity .",
    "this intensity does not change instantaneously with each mirror displacement .",
    "the delayed response of the intensity to a change in the mirror displacement leads to a force that can either agree or oppose the motion of the mirror , depending on whether the laser frequency is bigger or smaller than the cavity resonant frequency  @xcite . by including this intensity - dependent force , in addition to a thermal force on the mirror",
    ", the mirror can be cooled .    in our proposal here , the tlr ,",
    "whose frequency is determined by its overall capacitance and inductance , acts as a cavity .",
    "the beam is placed near the middle of the tlr and capacitively coupled to the tlr . when the mechanical beam has a displacement , the overall capacitance of the tlr changes , thereby the resonant frequency of the tlr also changes .",
    "now let us consider the case where the tlr is driven by a microwave with fixed frequency .",
    "any displacement of the beam will change , after a delay , the voltage between the tlr and the beam ( and also the force between them ) .",
    "recall that here we are considering two coupled oscillators : the tlr and the mechanical beam .",
    "the rf microwave drive acts directly on the tlr , and indirectly on the mechanical beam .",
    "after the transients are gone , the driven damped oscillator ( here , the tlr ) exhibits a steady - state response which is delayed with respect to the drive .",
    "in other words , the beam displacement changes the tlr s oscillation frequency @xmath1 .",
    "since the frequency @xmath2 of the drive is fixed , this change in @xmath1 will affect the steady - state amplitude of the tlr oscillator , which will be reached after some delay .",
    "the displacement of the beam ( i.e. , the action on the tlr ) , causes a delayed reaction ( i.e. , a delayed back - action ) force from the tlr to the beam .",
    "the delay is determined by the damping rate of the tlr .",
    "when the frequency of the microwave @xmath2 is smaller than the resonant frequency @xmath3 of the tlr , this back - action force opposes the motion the beam , thereby damping the brownian motion of the beam .",
    "this cooling mechanism studied here is also related to the mechanism recently employed in refs .  .",
    "there , cooling is produced by a capacitive force which is phase - shifted relative to the cantilever motion . in their set - up , when the cantilever oscillates , its motion modulates the capacitance of an lc circuit , therefore modulating its resonant frequency .",
    "this resonant frequency , and the potential across the capacitance , is modulated relative to the fixed frequency of the applied rf drive . the modulated force linked to this potential shifts the resonant frequency of the cantilever  @xcite .",
    "because of the finite response time of the lc circuit , there is a phase lag in the force , relative to the motion . when the rf frequency is smaller than the resonant frequency , the phase lag produces a force that opposes the cantilever velocity , producing damping .",
    "when this damping is realized without introducing too much noise in the force , then the cantilever is cooled .",
    "our analysis , presented below , shows that it is possible to cool a 2 mhz beam , initially at @xmath4 mk , down to its quantum vibrational ground state at around @xmath5 mk .",
    "this is a cooling factor of about @xmath6 . our proposed device , which is a combination of the devices in refs .",
    ", should be realizable in experiments . moreover , because of its on - chip structure , our device has some practical advantages to be integrated in dilution refrigerators and be operated on ; while optomechanical systems need an additional optical system .",
    "allow the input and output signals to be coupled to the central ( hatched ) stripline .",
    "this allows to measure the amplitude and phase of the 1d tlr and applying dc and rf pulses to the 1d tlr.,width=321 ]",

    "[ fig : device1](b ) .",
    "it can be described as a series of resonators that accommodate different resonant modes  @xcite .",
    "since the length of the micro - beam is much smaller than that of the 1d tlr , we consider the voltage in the middle of the 1d tlr to be the voltage @xmath10 on the beam . here , we only consider the mode with the largest coupling , i.e. , the lowest mode  @xcite coupled to the beam .",

    "the coulomb force from the tlr has two effects on the mean kinetic energy of the beam .",

    "for the case when @xmath80 or @xmath81 , the frequency of the beam will be greatly shifted away from the original one , resulting in weak cooling of the beam  @xcite .",
    "in the above discussions , we did not consider the effect of fluctuations of @xmath72 on the effective temperature .",
    "equation ( [ eq : eff - damping - beam ] ) shows that the damping rate of the beam is modified because of the existence of the tlr .",
    "thus , the effective temperature is changed , ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : defination - of - temperature ] ) and ( [ eq : effective - temperature03 ] ) ) , however , according to the fluctuation and dissipation theorem , dampings are always accompanied with noises .",
    "we now study noises on the beam introduced by the force @xmath83 of the tlr .",
    "actually , there are several noise sources affecting @xmath72 , such as fluctuations in the driving microwave , back - action due to measurements on the tlr , and thermal noise in the tlr . among these noise sources",
    ", the thermal noise provides an intrinsic limit of the fluctuations of @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , a lower limit @xmath84 of the spectral density of @xmath72 can be obtained by considering the voltage fluctuation @xmath85 from the thermal noise in the tlr , which is given by @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the effective resistor in the tlr .",
    "the voltage fluctuation @xmath85 gives rise to a fluctuation of the charge on the capacitor @xmath12 , giving rise to fluctuations of @xmath72 on the beam through the capacitor @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath88 for small vibration amplitudes of the beam , we find that the thermal noise in the tlr gives a fluctuation of @xmath67 on the beam @xmath89    assuming an ohmic friction for the beam , the temperature @xmath90 and the damping rate @xmath91 of the beam and the spectral density @xmath92 of the noise on the beam have the following relation@xcite @xmath93 for not very low temperature near the beam s resonant frequency we find that an effective temperature of the beam could be related to the spectral density @xmath92 and the damping rate of the beam : @xmath94 . therefore , after considering the fluctuation and dissipation theorem we further modify the effective temperature of the beam to @xmath95 where we only take into account the thermal noise in the tlr .",
    "indeed , the attainable lowest effective temperature of the beam would be higher than the above limit , since there are also other fluctuations acting on the beam , from both the driving microwave and the back - action of the measurement on the beam .",
    "these fluctuations would add more noises , which depend on the special parameters of the circuit for the driving microwave and the circuit for the measurement , e.g. , the noise from amplifiers  @xcite , in the numerator of eq .",

    "n / m for optimal detuning of the driving microwave .",
    "it is possible to obtain stronger coupling between the beam and the tlr by increasing the driving power of the microwave , as long as the voltage @xmath108 between the beam and the tlr is kept below the breakdown voltage . using the parameters list above and assuming @xmath109 , the cooling effect @xmath99 depends on the oscillating frequency @xmath96 of the beam and the detuning @xmath98 , as shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : eff - spring - constant ] ) .",
    "otherwise , the optimal value of @xmath112 to reach the lowest @xmath113 will be slightly drifting away from unity  @xcite . the best cooling effect on a 200 khz beam",
    "is estimated to be @xmath114 for the parameters given above .",
    "therefore , if this beam is precooled by the dilution refrigerator to a temperature of 1 k , it can be further cooled down to 0.36 mk using the tlr .    for a 2 mhz beam",
    ", we use a stronger microwave @xmath115 mv .",
    "the best cooling effect is about @xmath116 with @xmath117 mhz .",
    "if the beam is precooled by the dilution refrigerator to a temperature of 50 mk , it could be further cooled down to 0.07 mk by the tlr .",
    "this implies that the thermal phonons in the 2 mhz beam will be less than 0.24 , where a quantum description is expected  @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that , when the beam reaches a quantum regime a quantum theory is expected to give the cooling efficiency in the quantum regime .    above we",
    "do not consider matching the impedance of the tlr to that of the conventional microwave components  @xcite . to obtain an optimal impedance ,",
    "e.g. 50 @xmath118 , of tlr , one needs to carefully design the geometry of the tlr and the beam .",
    "if one simply considers the tlr as a straight coplanar transmission line , then @xmath119 might be @xmath120 1 pf for a 10 ghz tlr .",
    "thus , a larger @xmath121 is necessary for this larger @xmath119 to maintain the cooling effects described above .",
    "the fabrication of superconducting tlr now is good enough to provide a 1d tlr with an electrical quality factor as high as @xmath122 .",
    "the reduced effective temperature @xmath53 of the beam can be inferred from the power spectrum of the 1d tlr around the oscillating frequency @xmath20 , whose integral is proportional to the effective temperature .",
    "detection of microwave photon was achieved in recent experiments , capable of resolving a single microwave photon number  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in principle the information of the beam could be inferred by detecting the field in the tlr .",
    "the working principle of our proposal is similar to that in the optomechanical cooling by a fabry - prot cavity  @xcite .",
    "the cooling or heating is determined by the detuning between the driving laser and cavity , which is determined by the detuning between the driving microwave and the tlr in our case . in both cases ,",
    "a high mechanical quality factor is needed , since it measures heating effects on the beam by its thermal environments .",
    "our proposal is also similar to the one in ref .  , which deals with a cantilever and a coupled lc circuit .",
    "here we consider a doubly - clamped beam coupled to a co - planar transmission line resonator ( tlr ) . besides considering different physical systems , in ref .  , they analyze only _ two _ special detunings between the frequency of the driven microwave and the resonant frequency of the lc circuit . here",
    "we present a more general result for the effective elastic constant versus the detuning , valid for all values of the detuning between the frequency of the driven microwave and the resonant frequency of the tlr .",
    "we also explain how the damping rate of the beam and the noise on the beam is changed by the tlr .",
    "our studies enable us to optimize the setup of experimental parameters for achieving a lower effective temperature of the beam , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiency ] .    since the best cooling is obtained when @xmath123 , the cooling efficiency of optical - cavity cooling would be efficient for beams with tens of mhz , or even higher frequency , considering current experimental parameters . for a typical optical cavity , with a resonant frequency of @xmath124 hz",
    ", the damping rate is about @xmath125 hz , for an optical quality factor @xmath122 , making it favorable for cooling a 100 mhz beam .",
    "however , to cool a beam with a @xmath126 mhz vibration frequency , the optimal damping rate of the optical cavity would also be @xmath126 mhz .",
    "this requires an optical quality factor @xmath127 for a tiny mirror .",
    "a high mechanical quality factor is also required at the same time , which is a great challenge for the fabrication of the tiny mirror . however , in our case , the damping rate of the tlr can be as small as 200 khz .",
    "the damping rate of the tlr can be easily increased to match the frequency of the beam by attaching an additional circuit to the tlr , while it is very difficult to decrease the damping rate of an optical cavity to match the lower - frequency beam .",
    "thus a mhz - beam could be cooled down to its quantum ground state and also reach the regime @xmath128 , where the cavity line width is much smaller than the mechanical frequency and the corresponding cavity detuning .",
    "then the photon sidebands could be resolved when the beam is cooled down to the quantum regime  @xcite .",
