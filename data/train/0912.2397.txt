    "one of the most significant discovery in the string theory is the ads / cft correspondence which proposed by maldacena @xcite in the last century .",
    "it tells us that the gravity theory in a @xmath0-dimensional ads spacetime can be described by a conformal field theory on the @xmath1-dimensional boundary .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence is a powerful tool to understand the strongly coupled gauge theories @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been applied extensively to investigate some condensed matter phenomena , such as superconductivity @xcite , superfluid @xcite , and so on .",
    "superconductivity is a common phenomenon occurring in certain materials at very low temperatures .",
    "the most striking feature of the phenomenon is that the material has exactly zero electrical resistance for a direct current ( dc ) and the exclusion of the interior magnetic field when it is in the superconducting state . the first model for the holographic superconductors in the ads black - hole spacetime is proposed by hartnoll , herzog and horowitz @xcite .",
    "they considered the classical instability of a black hole in ads spacetime against perturbation by a charged scalar field and found that if the temperature @xmath2 of the black hole is below a critical temperature @xmath3 the instability of the black hole emerges , which implies that the original schwarzschild - ads black hole should be replaced by a new black hole with the charged scalar hair .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the emergence of the hairy ads black hole means the formation of a charged condensation in the dual cfts @xcite .",
    "moreover , the expectation values of the charged operators undergo the u(1 ) symmetry breaking and then the superconductive is formed .",
    "hartnoll , herzog and horowitz @xcite also calculated the electrical conductive of the charged condensation and found that the condensation has zero electrical dc resistance , which is the same as that obtained in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite .",
    "this has triggered many people to study holographic superconductors in the various theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite considered the holographic superconductors in the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity and found that the higher curvature corrections make condensation harder to form .",
    "et al _ @xcite investigated the holographic superconductor models in the hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "recent studies also showed that there exist holographic superconductors in the string / m theory @xcite .",
    "the properties of holographic superconductors at the zero - temperature limit have also been considered extensively @xcite .",
    "these results can help us to understand more about the holographic superconductors in the asymptotical ads black holes .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the holographic superconductors in planar ads black hole with a global monopole .",
    "a global monopole is one of the topological defects which could be formed during phase transitions in the evolution of the early universe .",
    "the metric of the black hole with a global monopole was obtained by barriola and vilenkin @xcite , which arises from the breaking of global @xmath4 symmetry of a triplet scalar field in a schwarzschild background .",
    "the presence of the global monopole results in that the black hole has different topological structure from that of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the physical properties of the black hole with a global monopole have been studied extensively in recent years @xcite .",
    "the main purpose in this paper is to see how the global monopole affects the holographic superconductors in this asymptotic ads black hole .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the metric describing a planar schwarzschild - ads black hole with a global monopole . in sec .",
    "iii , we give the basic equations and study numerically holographic superconductors in the planar black hole background with a global monopole .",
    "our results show that the global monopole presents the different effects on the different condensations . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the electrical conductivity of the charged condensates by ignoring the backreaction of the dynamical matter field on the spacetime metric . finally , in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "the simplest model that gives rise to the global monopole is described by the lagrangian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a multiplet of scalar field , @xmath7 is the energy scale of symmetry breaking and @xmath8 is a constant .",
    "the metric ansatz describing a planar black hole with a global monopole can be taken as @xmath9 in this case the field configuration describing a monopole is @xmath10 using the lagrangian ( [ l1 ] ) and metric ( [ m1 ] ) , we can calculate the energy - momentum tensor @xmath11 and then obtain the nonzero components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath12 ^ 2,\\\\ t^{r}_r&=&-\\frac{1}{2}\\eta^2h'(r)^2f(r)+\\eta^2\\frac{h(r)^2}{r^2}+\\frac{\\gamma}{4}\\bigg[\\eta^2h(r)^2-\\eta^2\\bigg]^2,\\\\ t^{x}_x&=&t^{y}_y=\\frac{1}{2}\\eta^2h'(r)^2f(r)+\\frac{\\gamma}{4}\\bigg[\\eta^2h(r)^2-\\eta^2\\bigg]^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take an approximation @xmath13 outside the core .",
    "it is reasonable because that @xmath14 grows linearly when @xmath15 and approaches exponentially unity as soon as @xmath16 .    in the planar ads background ,",
    "the einstein equations are given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the radius of ads .",
    "an exact solution of the equations ( [ ai1 ] ) and ( [ ai2 ] ) is @xmath19 where the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "this solution describes a planar schwarzschild - ads black hole with a global monopole .",
    "as @xmath21 tends to zero , the spacetime reduces to a four dimensional schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole ( [ me4 ] ) is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the event horizon of the black hole and we set the ads radius is @xmath24 .",
    "in order to investigate the holographic superconductors in the background of the planar schwarzschild - ads black hole with a global monopole , we need a condensate through a charged scalar field . here",
    "we adopt to the probe approximation and neglect the backreaction of the charged scalar field on the background .",
    "it must be pointed out that this charged scalar field is not the multiplet scalar field describing the global monopole .",
    "it may be an interesting topic to study the holographic superconductors of the scalar field which gives rise to the global monopole .",
    "however , it is very difficult because that for the scalar field with the form ( [ sg1 ] ) the coupled equation ( [ e2 ] ) can not be separable in the following calculations .",
    "thus , in this paper we only consider the condensate of an external charged scalar field in the background of a black hole with a global monopole .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , let us consider a maxwell field and a charged complex scalar field .",
    "the lagrangian can be expressed as @xcite @xmath25 is electromagnetic tensor and @xmath26 is a charged complex scalar field . adopting to the ansatz @xmath27",
    "we can obtain the equations of motion for the complex scalar field @xmath26 and electrical scalar potential @xmath28 in the background of the schwarzschild - ads black hole with a global monopole @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . here",
    "a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "obviously , it is very difficult to obtain the nontrivial analytical solutions to the nonlinear equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "so we have to resort numerical method to solve above equations . in general",
