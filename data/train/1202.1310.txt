    "our main findings for a prototypical @xmath0-symmetric potential , which is harmonic in its real part and has a localized imaginary part ( parametrized by an amplitude parameter @xmath1 ) are summarized as follows : 1 ) dark solitons are shown to be subject to spontaneous symmetry - breaking ( ssb ) instabilities for small @xmath1 ; 2 ) for higher values of @xmath1 , the ground state and the first excited state ( single dark soliton ) , as well as pairwise e.g .",

    "figure [ fig5 ] depicts the full bifurcation scenario for solutions bearing no vortices ( the tf background cloud ) , one to six vortices , and the dark soliton stripe . as in 1d , the tf background is stable in all its domain of existence and collides , in a blue - sky bifurcation , for a large enough value of @xmath1 , with an excited state .",
    "however , in contrast to the 1d case where this collision happens with the first excited state , in 2d the collision occurs with the _ second _ excited state , due to the absence of net topological charge in such a vortex - dipole ( see top - right red curve ) bearing two opposite charge vortices emerging from the central dip of the tf background . at this critical point",

    "the branches with _ even _ number of vortices are all connected . as more and more vortex pairs emerge , the cloud `` saturates '' and can no longer fit in new vortex pairs finally colliding with a dark soliton stripe ( see lower blue branch in the figure ) .",

    "as @xmath1 increases the vortex moves towards the periphery of the cloud and a dip at the center of the cloud deepens until a vortex pair emerges from it .",
    "this scenario connects the one - vortex branch with the _ asymmetric _ three - vortex ( @xmath116 vortex tripole ) branch , as it is depicted with the top ( magenta and green ) lines in panel [ fig5](a ) and the series of snapshots in panels [ fig5](c ) .",
    "as it is evident from the figure , the asymmetric three - vortex branch eventually connects with the symmetric one for values of @xmath117 .",
    "a similar bifurcation occurs with the symmetric three - vortex branch , which becomes asymmetric with a deepening dip at the center where a vortex pair emerges ( at the same time that a vortex is lost at the periphery ) , connecting in this way with the four - vortex branch [ see series of snapshots in panels [ fig5](d ) ] .    as for the dynamics of unstable steady states ,",
    "we have observed in analogy with the 1d case that ( a ) a single vortex tends to migrate towards the minimum of the lossy side of the potential , while the remaining vortices ( if present ) perform almost circular orbits at the periphery of the cloud where they are eventually absorbed ; and ( b ) past @xmath100 , using as an initial condition the form of the tf background , also produces the spontaneous formation of an increasing number of vortices for larger values of @xmath1 ( namely , a `` vortex generator '' ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the precise structure of the bifurcation diagram depends of the values of the propagation constant @xmath23 and the trap strength @xmath118 . for weaker @xmath118 and/or larger @xmath23",
    "the extent of the tf background will be larger allowing for a longer bifurcating chain of higher - order vortex states .",
    "nonetheless , the displayed ssb instabilities and phenomenology and the nonlinear @xmath0 transition involving the cascade of blue - sky bifurcations ( notice that in the 2d case the order is reversed and the largest @xmath1 bifurcation is that involving the tf and the dipole states ) appear to be universal in confining @xmath0-symmetric potentials .",
    "in the present work , we have developed some fundamental insights stemming from the interplay of defocusing nonlinearity and @xmath0-symmetric confining potentials .",
    "we identified both a symmetry - breaking bifurcation destabilizing the dark solitons that leads to non - stationary dynamics , as well as a nonlinear analogue of the @xmath0 transition that eventually terminates both the ground state and the dark soliton branch , yielding purely gain - loss dynamics within the system .",
    "similar bifurcation phenomena and dynamics of mobility or of spontaneous emergence of dynamical patterns forming out of the destabilization of the nonlinear states were identified in two - dimensional settings , for vortices .",
    "these investigations , we believe , pave the way for studying @xmath0-symmetric systems in the context of defocusing nonlinearities and of higher dimensional systems , which are some of the natural extensions of the @xmath0-symmetric literature .",
    "a canonical set of investigations which is still missing concerns the effects of such potentials in three - dimensional continuum or higher dimensional lattice contexts , as well as the manipulation of nonlinear states emerging in these systems .",
    "another relevant possibility arising from our considerations here in is the study of inexact @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear systems and their comparison to exact ones , as well as the consideration of the interplay of the nonlinearity with merely loss ( rather than gain - loss ) in the passive-@xmath0 nonlinear settings .",
