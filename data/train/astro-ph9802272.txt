    "globular clusters in the galaxy and in the local group play a fundamental role in connecting studies of individual stars and integrated properties of star clusters . in this respect ,",
    "studies of star clusters in the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) are particularly suitable .",
    "the proximity and inclination of this giant spiral allow one to study in detail each of its constituent sub - systems , halo , disk , and bulge even near the galaxy center .",
    "m31 has been already extensively surveyed for  e.g. , vetesnik ( 1962 ) , sargent et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and the bologna group catalogue by battistini et al .",
    "the brightest clusters have been explored by means of integrated spectroscopy , which makes it possible to determine some of their fundamental parameters , such as metallicity , age and reddening , as well as to confirm their true nature as ( e.g. burstein et al .",
    "1984 , tripicco 1989 , huchra , brodie & kent 1991 , jablonka , alloin & bica 1992 , bica et al . 1992 , and huchra et al . 1996 ) .",
    "a number of studies have concentrated on identifying clusters near the center of m31 , e.g. , alloin , pelat & bijaoui ( 1976 ) , aurire , coupinot & hecquet ( 1992 ) and battistini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "in the present paper , we concentrate on the central 10  by 10region of m31 and derive velocities , metallicities , ages and reddenings of the confirmed star clusters .",
    "this work is a first attempt at getting a picture of the properties of  in the inner bulge of a spiral galaxy ( other than our own ) , which in turn must help constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "one of our principal goals is to determine how frequent the occurrence of super  can be .",
    "bulge central regions , locations of intense star formation , appear to be one of the best places to find them .",
    "the methods employed in the present work , i.e. comparison with template cluster spectra and grids of spectral properties as a function of age and metallicity , have been developed and extensively used to study star clusters in our galaxy ( e.g. bica & alloin 1986a , b ) , the magellanic clouds",
    "( e.g. santos et al .",
    "1995a ) , m31 itself ( jablonka et al .",
    "1992 ) , and more recently ngc5128 ( jablonka et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section2 gives a description of the sample ; section3 details observations and reductions ; section4 deals with the radial velocity measurements ; section5 presents measurements of equivalent widths and results for cluster parameters ; a discussion of the results is given in section  6 .",
    "finally , we summarise our conclusions in section7 .",

    "@xmath2 : this cluster is more  than the template g1 , which was used for the reddening determination .",
    "the top panel of figure  4 illustrates clearly the problem of /old  degeneracy .",
    "we display an average of the  templates i1 and i2 ( 1 to 3gyrs ) from bica ( 1988 ) , which includes galactic open clusters and lmc clusters , and the templates g5 and g3 , which are averages of galactic  with @xmath3  and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "notice the resemblance in balmer lines and metallic features , as well as in continuum distribution .",
    "we also show the m31 clusters bo118 and g175 to illustrate the difficulty in classifying unambiguously these objects , especially g175 , because of its unusually strong balmer lines . in table",
    "[ tab_cp ] we point this out explicitly for g175 , and it must be kept in mind that a wider spectral range should be observed in order to establish the nature of all objects with @xmath5-@xmath6 .",
    "the occurrence of  clusters with metallicity @xmath7  can not be ruled out in a scenario of cannibalism ( section  6.3 ) .",
    "in fact ,  clusters with this metallicity , such as ngc419 in the smc ( bica & alloin 1986a ) , could have been accreted .    assuming that g175 and bo118 are indeed",
    ", they would show intrinsic differences compared with galactic . at a given metallicity",
    ", these two clusters have exceedingly strong balmer absorption , as previously reported by burstein et al .",
    "this can be verified with the help of ews of metallic features ( table  [ tab_ew ] ) and relative strengths of balmer to nearby metallic features , such as  _ vs _ h+h@xmath8 , and g band _ vs _ h@xmath9 .",
    "bo118 has ews of metallic features like those of the template g3 ( @xmath10-@xmath6 ) , but metallic / balmer line ratios like those of g4 ( @xmath10-@xmath11 ) .",
    "g175 is further shifted with respect to average properties of galactic , in the sense that metallic features are like those of g3/g4 , and the metallic / balmer ratios are more similar to those of the g5 template ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this would suggest a more populated blue - horizontal branch in m31 clusters at metallicities comparable to galactic globular clusters .",
    "we point out that in our galaxy there exists a considerable dispersion in the horizontal branch properties of  at a given metallicity , the second parameter phenomenon , at least in the halo ( e.g. zinn 1980 ) .      ideally , the best spectroscopic method to determine reddening for star clusters is to have available reddening - free template spectra of similar properties , and to use a wavelength baseline as wide as possible , as in the study of  in ngc5128 by jablonka et al .",
    "although the present wavelength range is limited , it is still useful to constrain the reddening values .",
    "we used the  templates g5 to g1 , ranging from @xmath12  to nearly - solar metallicity as reference spectra ( bica 1988 ) . in the case of g1",
    ", the bica ( 1988 ) template has been complemented with the m31  of comparable metallicity g222 and g170 ( jablonka et al .",
    "1992 ) in order to further improve the signal / noise ratio . for completeness",
    ", we also included the i1/i2 template , since for some clusters in table  [ tab_cp ] , this possibility can not be ruled out ( sect .",
    "however , we point out that the reddening is not affected since , in the present spectral domain , the spectral distributions of i1/i2 and the old  templates are very similar ; this is illustrated in the top panel of figure  [ fig4 ] where we also include an example of reddening determination . in the bottom panel",
    "we show an example of a reddening - corrected   m31  ( bo124 ) compared to the g1 template .",
    "the template adopted in each case is given in column 4 of table  [ tab_cp ] , and the resulting  in column 5 .    according to burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) , the foreground ( milky way ) reddening in the direction of m31 is @xmath13 .",
    "the results for the m31 cluster sample by jablonka et al .",
    "( 1992 ) suggested a somewhat lower value @xmath14 . in the present study ,",
    "the lowest values and corresponding uncertainties ( table  [ tab_cp ] ) are compatible with the latter value .",
    "for 6 other clusters we derive values significantly in excess of this limit , which indicates considerable internal reddening arising probably in dust clouds in the inner disk of m31 .",
    "a more precise ranking of clusters by metallicity may be obtained by summing the ews of metallic features , as did jablonka et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in the present paper",
    "we adopt the following absorption windows :   ( # 4 ) , fei ( # 10 ) , cn ( # 11 ) , cai ( # 12 ) , fei ( # 13 ) , ch g ( # 14 ) and fei ( # 16 ) .",
    "these features are not affected by balmer lines and are available for all sample clusters ( table  3 ) .",
    "the resulting sum of the equivalent widths ( ) is given in column 6 of table  4 .",
    "the calibration of  with  for old clusters in the grid by bica & alloin ( 1986b ) , is displayed in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "we also include in this figure a relation of  for the templates g1 , g2 and g3 , in which they are assumed to have metallicities @xmath15  and @xmath4 , respectively , similar to that applied to ngc5128  by jablonka et al .",
    "both approaches provide similar results .    applying the bica & alloin ( 1986b ) calibration to the m31 clusters ( assumed to be genuine ) ,",
    "we obtain the  values listed in column 7 of table  4 . applying the same relation to g1 , g2 and g3",
    ", we obtain @xmath16  and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "a fundamental problem in stellar populations is the abundance calibration of the  end . for the clusters in common with the spectroscopic study by huchra et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , we show their  values in column 8 of table  4 . in general , the same ranking is found , but the huchra et al .",
    "metallicities are systematically lower .",
    "this question of calibration has been recently been addressed by means of high dispersion spectra of individual stars ( barbuy et al .",
    "1992 , 1997 ) , deep colour magnitude diagrams ( ortolani et al .",
    "1995 ) , and integrated spectra ( santos et al .",
    "1995b ) , in the case of the key nearly - solar metallicity  ngc6553 and ngc6528 ( which belong to the g1 template ) .",
    "the iron abundance  in such clusters appears to be somewhat under solar ( @xmath18 ) , whereas [ @xmath19-elements / fe ] are enhanced , resulting in an overall metallicity @xmath20 . in this sense ,",
    "the present   calibration , which includes @xmath19-elements , tends to give higher values but is fundamentally compatible with the based scale employed by huchra et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .",
    "we also include in table  4 ( column 9 ) metallicity estimates from @xmath21  integrated photometry by cohen & matthews ( 1994 , hereafter cm94 ) .",
    "a comparison of the latter values with those of the present study ( column 7 ) shows a systematic difference in the sense that cm94 values are lower . however , the two most  clusters g177 and g174 have spectral absorptions indistinguishable from those of the most  galaxy nuclei ( section  6.3 ) .",
    "the values estimated by cm94 for these clusters would imply sub - solar metallicities for the nuclei of giant galaxies . concerning the metallicity ranking , the agreement is good between the two studies , with the exception of g175 , g184 and g190 .",
    "g175 and g184 are considerably reddened ( table  4 ) , and the higher metallicity values in cm94 can be explained by the fact that they adopted a constant reddening for their cluster sample .",
    "g190 would be a very  cluster according to their value .",
    "however , the spectral features ( figure  3 ) are clearly those of a  cluster ; in particular the g band is strong and the balmer lines are weak .",
    "2.0 cm -0.0 cm -0.75 cm",
    "assuming that all objects are indeed old globular clusters , we show in figure  [ fig6 ] the  histogram using column 7 of table  4 .",
    "the sample is small , but some interesting features are present .",
    "the distribution is basically gaussian with an average @xmath22  and intrinsic @xmath23 , for this central bulge sample in m31 .",
    "recently barbuy , bica & ortolani ( 1997 ) have studied in detail the sample of 16 galactic  projected within a radius of 5  of the galactic center , based on colour magnitude diagrams ; they have obtained @xmath24  with @xmath25 .",
    "thus , these galactic and m31 bulge  samples have similar metallicity distribution .",
    "the baade s window sample of k giants studied by mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) has @xmath26  with @xmath27 . consequently",
    ", both the bulge  samples in our galaxy and in m31 seem to be , on the average , @xmath28  dex less  than the bulge stars in our galaxy ( however we caution that the  samples are small ) .",
    "possible explanations for this difference between  and stars are related to projection effects and/or intrinsic properties .",
    "some interloping halo clusters are expected in the observed lines of sight of m31 and galactic central clusters , which might be contaminating the samples .",
    "alternatively , these differences might reflect different chemical enrichment histories .",
    "however , samples of bulge clusters are still small and this domain of investigation is still at its early stages .",
    "0.0 cm -0.0 cm -0.75 cm    super  are apparently not a very common phenomenon , since the only examples in our sample are g174 and g177 . for more definite results , it would be important to increase the spatial coverage of the observations to the other quadrants ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we present in figure  7 the spatial dependence of metallicity , reddening and radial velocity for the star cluster sample , respectively from columns 7 and 5 of table  4 , and an average of columns 4 and 5 of table  1 .",
    "the sample is small and spatially restricted to one side of the nucleus ( figure  1 ) , but conclusions can still be drawn .",
    "clusters of different metallicities are well - mixed .",
    "the most reddened clusters appear superimposed on the galaxy major axis , since there the disk absorption would be more important . finally , the velocity distribution suggests a spatial mixing of clusters which would be in agreement with the velocity dispersion of a bulge .",
    "the velocity dispersion of our 16 confirmed clusters is 255 km / sec ( unweighted ) . to be able to say anything about possible rotation",
    ", it would be necessary to observe the clusters in the other quadrants .",
    "2.0 cm -0.0 cm -0.75 cm      0.0 cm -0.0 cm -0.75 cm    it is important to compare single stellar population ( star cluster ) spectral properties with those of composite stellar populations ( galaxies ) , in view of stellar population synthesis .",
    "bica & alloin ( 1986a , b and 1987 ) and bica ( 1988 ) called attention to the fact that the spectral properties of the nearly - solar metallicity  like ngc6528 , ngc6553 and ngc6440 , were almost comparable to those of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "more recently , jablonka et al . (",
    "1992 ) pointed out that the m31 bulge  g177 ( also in the present sample ) was as strong - lined as the giant ellipticals . in the present sample , there is a cluster which is even more strong - lined , g174 , whose spectrum is compared in figure  [ fig8 ] to that of the m31 semi - stellar nucleus ( bica , alloin & schmidt 1990 ) , that of the most  giant elliptical nuclei ( the e1 template in bica 1988 ) , and finally , a less  one , of galaxy nuclei of somewhat less luminous ellipticals ( the e3 template in bica 1988 ) .",
    "the  g174 is clearly more strong - lined than e3 , and is similar to those of the most  known stellar populations , i.e. e1 and the semi - stellar nucleus of m31 .",
    "notice in particular the comparable strengths of the blue cn band ( @xmath29 4150 ) which are among the most sensitive metallicity indicators , remaining unsaturated in the high metallicity range . as a consequence",
    ", g174 appears to have been formed from the same parent gas as the semi - stellar nucleus , and so it possibly represents the highest chemical enrichment that galaxies can attain .",
    "we have carried out spectroscopy of a sample of 19 objects projected on the bulge of m31 : 16 were confirmed as star clusters , 2 are galactic dwarf stars , and 1 is a high redshift background galaxy .",
    "the objects confirmed as star clusters had been classified as bologna classes a and b , whereas the 3 non - clusters were of the low probability class c.    we derived radial velocities , metallicities , ages and reddenings for our sample clusters . in some cases , especially g175 ,",
    "there remains an ambiguity between intermediate and old cluster ages , due to the limited wavelength range observed .",
    "two clusters are found to be super , g174 and g177 .",
    "their features are comparable to those in the most  stellar populations , i.e. , nuclei of giant ellipticals and the semi - stellar nucleus of m31 itself .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the sample is compatible with the distribution of globulars in the bulge of our galaxy .",
    "although small , both the m31 and the galaxy  samples seem to have an excess of   objects with respect to the stars in the galactic bulge . some interloping halo  might be present in both cluster samples .",
    "alternatively , this might be due to different formation histories . in the future",
    ", it will be important to observe clusters surrounding the nucleus in the other quadrants , in order to increase the statistical significance of the properties analyzed .",
    "in particular this would make it possible to check for the existence of rotation in the cluster system , as well as to identify new super  clusters , imposing constraints on chemical evolution models , especially at the high metallicity end .",
