    "the determination of the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is one of the most important issues of quark flavor physics .",
    "the precise determination of @xmath15 and @xmath16 elements has principal meaning , since they are solely responsible for the origin of cp violation in the ckm version of cp - violation within the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "furthermore , the accurate knowledge of these matrix elements can be useful in relating them to the fermion masses and also in searches for hints of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "therefore , strategies for the accurate determination of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are urgently required . in the existing literature",
    ", we can find proposals of different methods for precise determination of @xmath16 and @xmath15 from inclusive and exclusive , semileptonic and non leptonic decays of @xmath17 meson ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 has been historically measured by looking at the endpoint of the inclusive lepton spectrum in semileptonic @xmath17 decays , or from the exclusive semileptonic decays @xmath19 .",
    "it has been suggested that the measurements of hadronic invariant mass spectrum @xcite as well as hadronic energy spectrum @xcite in the inclusive @xmath20 decays can be useful in extracting @xmath21 with better theoretical understanding .",
    "the measurement of the ratio @xmath22 from the differential decay widths of the processes @xmath23 and @xmath24 by using @xmath25-flavor symmetry and heavy quark symmetry has also been proposed @xcite . there has also been recent theoretical progress on the exclusive @xmath26 semileptonic decay form factors using hqet - based scaling laws to extrapolate the form factors from semileptonic @xmath27 meson decays @xcite .",
    "the element @xmath15 can be extracted indirectly from @xmath28 mixing . however , in @xmath28 mixing the large uncertainty of hadronic matrix elements prevents one from extracting @xmath15 with good accuracy .",
    "a better extraction of @xmath29 can be made if @xmath30 mixing is measured as well , since the ratio @xmath31 can be determined much better .",
    "another method to determine @xmath32 comes from the analysis of the invariant dilepton mass distributions of @xmath33 decays @xcite .",
    "an interesting strategy for measuring @xmath34 was proposed in @xcite , which uses isospin symmetry to relate the decay @xmath35 to the well measured decay @xmath36 .    in this work",
    "we propose a new method to determine the ratio @xmath37 from an analysis of exclusive @xmath38 decays , where @xmath39 means pseudoscalar @xmath40 and vector @xmath41 mesons .",
    "the inclusive @xmath42 decay is theoretically very clean because of the absence of any long distance effects and very small qcd corrections @xmath43 @xcite , and is therefore practically free from the scale ( @xmath44 ) dependence .",
    "however , in spite of such theoretical advantages , it would be very difficult to detect this inclusive decay in experiments because the final state contains two missing neutrinos and ( many ) hadrons .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the necessary theoretical framework to describe @xmath45 decays . in section 3",
    "we study the ratios of branching fractions @xmath46 we also study the @xmath47 dependence of the differential decay rate of @xmath48 , and the ratio of the differential decay rates @xmath49 as well as @xmath50 section 4 is devoted to a discussion of our results and conclusion .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the process @xmath45 is described at quark level by the @xmath52 transition , and receives contributions from @xmath53-penguin and box diagrams , where dominant contributions come from intermediate top quarks .",
    "the effective hamiltonian responsible for @xmath52 decays is described by only one wilson coefficient , namely @xmath54 , and its explicit form is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the fermi constant , @xmath57 is the fine structure constant ( at the @xmath53 mass scale ) , and @xmath58 are elements of the ckm matrix . in eq . ( 1 ) , the wilson coefficient @xmath54 has the following form , including @xmath59 corrections : @xmath60 where @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath62\\ ] ] is the inami - lim function @xcite , and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the spence function , and @xmath65 here @xmath44 describes the scale dependence when leading qcd corrections are taken into account .",
    "the term @xmath66 is calculated in ref .",
    "the presence of only one operator in the effective hamiltonian makes the process @xmath67 very attractive , because the estimated theoretical uncertainty is related only to the value of the wilson coefficient @xmath54 ( @xmath68 the uncertainty due to the top quark mass ) , contrary to the @xmath69 decay , where the uncertainties are described by three independent wilson coefficients , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "another favorable property of this decay is the absence of any long distance effects , which make the @xmath73 process considerably more complicated . in spite of such theoretical advantages , in practice the inclusive channel",
    "@xmath74 would be very difficult to detect in experiments . only exclusive channels , namely @xmath75 ,",
    "may be studied experimentally .    at this point",
    "we consider the problem of computing the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian ( 1 ) between @xmath17 and @xmath39 states .",
    "this problem is related to the non - perturbative sector of qcd , and it can be solved only by using non - perturbative methods .",
    "the matrix element @xmath76 has been investigated through different approaches , such as chiral perturbation theory @xcite , three point qcd sum rules @xcite , relativistic quark model by the light front formalism @xcite , effective heavy quark theory @xcite , light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite-@xcite , @xmath77 .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements for @xmath78 ( @xmath79 is a pseudoscalar meson , @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) decays can be parametrized in terms of the form - factors @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the following way ; @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for @xmath87 (",
    "@xmath88 is the vector @xmath89 or @xmath90 meson ) decays , the hadronic matrix element can be written in terms of five form - factors : @xmath91 \\label{(5)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with condition @xmath92 note that after using the equations of motion the form - factor @xmath93 can be written as a linear combination of the form - factors @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( for more details see the first reference in @xcite ) : @xmath96 . \\label{(7)}\\ ] ]    in eq .",

    "\\label{(10 ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in deriving eqs.(8)(11 ) , we set the masses of @xmath107 and @xmath108 equal and the electron mass is neglected . using isospin symmetry",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath109 can be related to that for @xmath110 .",
    "it is clear that their ratio is independent of form - factors , @xmath68 free of hadronic long  distance uncertainties in the limit @xmath111 .",
    "corrections to the strict isospin symmetry , which come from phase space factors due to the difference of masses of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , isospin violation in the @xmath114 form - factors and electromagnetic radiative corrections to the @xmath115 transition , are all small . in the following discussions we shall neglect these small isospin violation effects . also note that these corrections for @xmath116 transition have been calculated in @xcite and found to be small , @xmath117    now we relate the branching ratio @xmath118 with @xmath119 . from eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 11 ) , we have @xmath120 here the numerical factor 6 comes from the number of light neutrinos , and isospin symmetry relation between the form - factors of @xmath121 and @xmath122 . in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , we also put @xmath123 . from eq .",
    "( 12 ) , we get @xmath124 where @xmath125 the second relation in ( 13 ) holds only for the ckm version of cp - violation within the sm .    from eq . ( 13 ) , we can see that measurements of the ratio of the branching fractions allow to determine the ratio of @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "up to now and @xmath126 from @xmath128 decays . ] , various methods for measuring each angle separately have been proposed , @xmath129 , the angle @xmath130 will be measured from @xmath131 decay with high accuracy , and angle @xmath132 is from the charged @xmath17 decay @xmath133 with larger uncertainty . as follows from eq .",
    "( 13 ) , one can measure the angle @xmath132 with small theoretical uncertainty , if @xmath134 is measured independently with high accuracy .",
    "the following relations will also be useful for extracting the phase angle @xmath132 precisely : @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 and @xmath138 in derivation ( 14)-(17 ) , we assumed that the mass of charged and neutral final states mesons are equal .",
    "now we consider the differential decay widths , @xmath139 .",
    "for the hadronic form - factors we have used the results of the works @xcite-@xcite , @xmath68 the monopole type form - factors based on light cone qcd sum rules .",
    "the values of the form - factors at @xmath140 are ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath141 note that all errors , which come from the uncertainties of the @xmath142 quark mass , the borel parameter variation , wave functions , non - inclusion of higher twists and radiative corrections , are added in quadrature .    in fig . 1 , we present the differential decay width @xmath143 as a function of the normalized momentum transfer square , @xmath144 . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the @xmath47 dependence of the ratio of the differential decay rates @xmath145 and @xmath48 , normalized to @xmath146 . in these figures ,",
    "dotted and dash - dotted curves correspond to the cases when the uncertainty is added and subtracted from the central values of all form - factors , respectively . for the central solid curve we use the central values of form - factors .",
    "we note that the errors in the differential decay width of fig . 1 due to the form - factors uncertainties are about @xmath147 . however , the errors in the ratio of fig .",
    "2 are reduced to about @xmath148 .",
    "we conclude that even though the errors from uncertainties of the form - factors for each channel are substantial , those in the corresponding ratio are comparatively small , and that for precise determination of the elements of the ckm matrix the investigation of the corresponding ratio is very suitable .",
    "we also note that the uncertainties for our main results , eqs .",
    "( 12)(16 ) , where we only assume flavor @xmath149 ( isospin ) , should be even much smaller than that shown in fig .",
    "2 , since there we had to assume flavor @xmath25 symmetry .    for completeness",
    "we present the integrated value for the branching fractions of @xmath150 and @xmath151 as well as the value of the ratio @xmath152 and @xmath153 : @xmath154 the values of the main input parameters , which appear in the expressions for the decay widths are @xmath155 for the @xmath17 meson life time , we take @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "we proposed a new method for the precise determination of @xmath3 from the ratios of the branching fractions @xmath157 as is well known , each partial decay width depends very strongly on hadronic form - factors .",
    "however , as also shown in eqs .",
    "( 9)(13 ) , these ratios , @xmath158 , are free of any hadronic uncertainties , if small isospin breaking effects are neglected .",
    "measurements of @xmath159 allow to determine @xmath3 with little theoretical error , which equals @xmath160 for the ckm version of cp - violation within the standard model .",
    "therefore , @xmath159 measures a relation between two different phases angles , which can be measured separately by experiments .",
    "we also found that each exclusive channel @xmath161 has rather large theoretical uncertainties due to the unknown hadronic form - factors , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in order to reduce these uncertainties we have considered the ratio of the corresponding exclusive channels , @xmath162 @xmath163 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 .    a few words about experimental statistics for detecting the @xmath164 decay follow :",
    "future symmetric and asymmetric @xmath17 factories should produce much more than @xmath165 @xmath166 mesons by the year 2010 . with @xmath167",
    "@xmath17 mesons effectively reconstructed , the number of expected events for @xmath168 channel is @xmath169 and the statistically estimated error for @xmath170 decay is approximately @xmath171 we argue that within the next decade the decay channel @xmath168 has a good chance for being detected in future @xmath17 factories .    note that the inclusive channels @xmath172 are also free of any theoretical uncertainties .",
    "however , measuring inclusive channels in experiments would be very difficult because of the two missing neutrinos and ( many ) hadrons . for completeness , we give here the summarized results for the inclusive decays in the lowest order : @xmath173 @xmath174 and @xmath175 in derivation of eq .",
