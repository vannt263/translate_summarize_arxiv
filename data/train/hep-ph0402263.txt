    "at high temperature and/or baryon density , the system governed by qcd will show a transition from an ordinary hadronic phase to a chirally symmetric , deconfined plasma phase@xcite .",
    "the main objective of the heavy  ion programs at rhic and at future lhc is to create this long - sought plasma state and to study collective properties of this many ",
    "body assembly@xcite .",
    "these two phases would have to be separated by a boundary with singularity if chiral symmetry and/or confinement of qcd were exact symmetry .",
    "in reality , dynamical quarks with finite masses @xmath0 make both symmetries only approximate , and their order parameters , the quark condensate and the polyakov loop , have non  vanishing values everywhere in the phase diagram .",
    "thus the plasma state may be smoothly connected with the ordinary hadronic state , even though they would possess qualitatively different properties from each other .",
    "recently a strong possibility of a critical point in the real qcd phase diagram was suggested@xcite , based on model calculations@xcite as well as lattice qcd results@xcite .",
    "it is the endpoint of the first ",
    "order line , inferred from the crossover behavior along the temperature ( @xmath1 ) axis and the first order transition along the axis of the baryon  number chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) , and is a genuine singular point with the same criticality as the z@xmath3 ising model .",
    "its location , which is sensitive to the strange quark mass @xmath4 , is expected to be within the reach of current experimental facilities .",
    "observable implications of this z@xmath3 critical point ( z@xmath3cp)cp instead of cep , to indicate the symmetry of the point . ] in heavy ion experiments have been discussed in the literature@xcite such as large fluctuations of the low  momentum particle distributions , and the limitations on them due to the finite space ",
    "time geometry of collision events .",
    "this z@xmath3cp will become a critical cornerstone in the qcd phase diagram once its location is confirmed in experiments .",
    "based on the approximate chiral symmetry , the scalar density is usually taken as the order parameter of the ginzburg  landau ( gl ) effective potential to describe the critical behavior at the z@xmath3cp . in this description",
    "all the singularities associated with the z@xmath3cp seemingly originate from softening of the scalar density fluctuations as the effective potential becomes flat there . especially , it might be concluded that the sigma meson becomes massless as an immediate consequence of this critical point .    as a basic fact , however , we should strictly distinguish between the chiral critical point with @xmath5 and the z@xmath3cp with @xmath6  even within the chiral effective models .",
    "when the chiral symmetry is exact , the @xmath1@xmath2 plane is divided into two domains of the symmetric and broken phases with a boundary _ line_. but the symmetry argument is unable to fix the order of the singularity of this line , especially the possible existence of the tri  critical point ( tcp ) on this line .",
    "since the z@xmath3cp at finite quark mass is the remnant of this tcp , the relation of the z@xmath3cp to the chiral symmetry is very obscure .",
    "in fact , z@xmath3 is not the symmetry of the underlying interactions , but of the thermodynamic potential at this particular isolated _ point _ in the @xmath1@xmath2 phase diagram@xcite . from this point of view",
    "the z@xmath3cp is different from the chiral critical point .",
    "the flat effective potential indicates the large fluctuation of the scalar density . at the chiral critical point , this is related to softening of the sigma meson mode , so as to form a symmetric excitation spectrum together with the pions . on the other hand , there is no such symmetry constraint at the z@xmath3cp . actually the scalar fluctuation _",
    "linearly _ mixes with fluctuations of baryon number density and energy density , and therefore not only the sigma mode but also the hydrodynamic mode are to be taken into account there to study the associated soft mode .",
    "consequently the fate of the sigma meson mode at the z@xmath3cp is non  trivial .",
    "recent calculations of the dynamic mode in the scalar channel using the chiral models@xcite indeed showed that the sigma meson is massive at the z@xmath3cp .",
    "furthermore , another scalar mode with space  like momentum dispersion is identified as the soft mode associated with the z@xmath3cp in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model@xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall confirm the result of ref .",
    "@xcite on the more general ground using the time ",
    "dependent ginzburg  landau ( tdgl ) approach , and extend the study to discuss the changeover of the soft modes along the critical line in the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath7 space within the tdgl approach as well as the njl model .",
    "our investigation is based on two fundamental observations about the z@xmath3cp .",
    "the first point is that the proper ordering density at the z@xmath3cp is a linear combination of the scalar , baryon number and internal energy densities@xcite , as mentioned above . because of this mixing all the susceptibilities of these densities diverge with the same critical exponent at the z@xmath3cp .",
    "in contrast , in the chiral critical transition , the susceptibility of the scalar density diverges with exponent @xmath8 of the o(4 ) model in the two  flavor case , while the other susceptibilities of the baryon number and the energy have the smaller exponent @xmath9 .",
    "the second is a consequence on the dynamics following from the conservation of the baryon number and the energy .",
    "the fluctuations of these conserved densities are intrinsically soft and constitute the hydrodynamic modes , whose excitation energies vanish as the wavevector @xmath10 goes to zero . susceptibilities of these conserved densities in turn have the spectral contributions solely from these hydrodynamic modes when expressed as a sum of mode spectra@xcite .",
    "hence the divergence of the susceptibility of a conserved density must be accompanied by critical slowing of a hydrodynamic mode . the spectral contribution from this hydrodynamic mode",
    "may well be involved in the scalar susceptibility through the mixing at the z@xmath3cp .    at an o(4 ) critical point ( o(4)cp ) the importance of the hydrodynamic mode depends on which phase we start from .",
    "the hydrodynamic mode plays no critical role in the symmetric phase whereas the scalar condensate makes the mixing possible in the broken phase .",
    "the situation becomes more subtle at the tcp , where the o(4 ) critical line shifts to the first ",
    "order line .",
    "only the scalar susceptibility diverges due to the softening of the sigma meson at the tcp if it is approached from the symmetric phase .",
    "otherwise , the hydrodynamic soft mode causes the divergence in the susceptibilities of the baryon number and energy as well as the scalar one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we briefly review generic properties of the phase diagram of qcd with two flavors near the tcp using the gl effective potential .",
    "it is stressed that at the tcp there are two relevant order parameters , the scalar condensate and a conserved density which is a linear combination of the baryon number and entropy densities .",
    "then we include the dynamics using the tdgl model .",
    "writing the susceptibilities as a spectral sum , we discuss the relative weight of the spectral contributions from the sigma and hydrodynamic modes .",
    "it is pointed out that the hydrodynamic contribution generates the discontinuity of the baryon number and entropy susceptibilities at the o(4)cp , and that this hydrodynamic mode gives the divergence at the tcp approached from the broken phase and also at the z@xmath3cp . in ",
    "iii we perform the same analysis using the njl model as an illustration .",
    "the gl effective potential with two ordering densities are numerically constructed there .",
    "the flat directions at the critical points are shown and discussed in relation to the divergences of the susceptibilities .",
    "the spectral origins of these divergences are studied with the relative weight of the mode spectra , and in detail based on the poles and residues of the scalar response function .",
    "sections iv and v are devoted to discussions and summary . in appendix",
    "a we prove the relation between the susceptibility and the response function , and in appendix b we present the explicit formulas of the response functions in the njl model . the results with the chiral quark model",
    "is briefly reported in appendix  c.",
    "let us briefly review the phase structure near the tcp@xcite .",
    "it is known that the critical properties near the tcp are described , up to logarithmic corrections , with the ginzburg ",
    "landau effective potential @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes the ( non-)singular part of the effective potential , and @xmath14 .",
    "the pseudo  scalar density is set to zero and neglected here in the mean field approximation .",
    "the critical exponents can be easily found from ( [ eq : gleffpot ] ) at the mean field level . along the line of the first  order transition within the symmetry plane ( @xmath15 ) , we have @xmath16 where three minima with @xmath17 coexist ( dashed line in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the baryon number and entropy densities are functions of @xmath18 due to symmetry , and discontinuous across the boundary between the symmetric phase ( @xmath19 ) and the broken phase ( @xmath20 ) . at the tcp , where @xmath21 , these _ three _ phases coalesce and the first order line ( @xmath22 ) smoothly joins with the o(4 ) critical line ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "once a small explicit breaking field @xmath24 is exerted , the o(4 ) critical line disappears and the tcp is lifted to the z@xmath3cp .",
    "the line of z@xmath3cp as a function of @xmath25 is determined by the condition , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , which is solved for a negative @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "two lines of z@xmath3cp with @xmath32 form the edge of the wing - like surface of the first order transition in the @xmath33@xmath28@xmath25 space , and these lines connect smoothly to the o(4 ) critical line at the tcp .",
    "this wing structure is mapped into the physical phase space of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath34 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the slope of the first  order boundary can be related to the discontinuities of the densities across the boundary via the clapeyron ",
    "clausius relation@xcite , @xmath35 with baryon number density @xmath36 and entropy density @xmath37 .",
    "the chiral broken phases with @xmath38 coexist within the symmetry plane @xmath15 , and accordingly there is no gap in @xmath36 and @xmath37 across this symmetry plane",
    ". only the scalar density @xmath39 bifurcates as the ordering density at the o(4)cp approached from the symmetric phase .",
    "its correlations with the `` energy  like '' densities vanish @xmath40 because of the symmetry in @xmath41 in the symmetric phase .",
    "= 0.55 = 0.45    from the relation ( [ eq : ccrel ] ) we know that all of @xmath39 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 generally have discontinuities across the wing because there is no reason for any of these slopes to vanish once @xmath42 .",
    "let us discuss the energy  like and ordering densities around the z@xmath3cp@xcite .",
    "first we introduce the `` temperature  like '' field as a vector tangential to the coexistence boundary .",
    "then the energy - like density is defined as the thermodynamic variable conjugate to this temperature  like field .",
    "this density has no discontinuity in the vicinity of the critical point . since the boundary is two  dimensional , there are two independent temperature  like fields and correspondingly two energy  like densities .",
    "next the ordering density is defined as the density whose correlations with the energy ",
    "like densities vanish at the critical point approached from the `` symmetric '' phase along the temperature  like direction .",
    "the conjugate field of this ordering density is no longer tangential to the coexistence boundary .",
    "there is a single ordering density at the z@xmath3cp , which is in general a linear combination of @xmath39 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . since all the susceptibilities of these densities include the same singular fluctuation , they diverge with the same critical exponent at the z@xmath3cp .    the coexistence wing is squeezed to be one  dimensional at the tcp , where two lines of the z@xmath3cp and the line of the first order transition with @xmath15 merge and smoothly connect to the single o(4 ) critical line .",
    "thus at the tcp we have only one energy  like density , which will be a linear combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly there are _ two _ ordering densities from dimensionality .",
    "the obvious one is the scalar density @xmath39 related to the chiral symmetry and the other @xmath43 is another linear combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 representing the z@xmath3 symmetry of the potential at this particular point .",
    "it is sometimes useful to construct the effective potential with two ordering densities , @xmath39 and @xmath43 , which become soft at the tcp .",
    "the same observation can be made by looking at the susceptibilities directly .",
    "there are three fields @xmath25 , @xmath33 and @xmath28 in the effective potential ( [ eq : gleffpot ] ) .",
    "the singular parts of the corresponding susceptibilities form a 3-by-3 matrix ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 with @xmath46 the scalar susceptibility , @xmath47 where @xmath39 takes the value at the extremum of the potential . when the o(4)cp is approached from the symmetric phase , @xmath48 . in the broken phase the situation is different .",
    "the singular part of ( 1 ) gives a finite contribution @xmath49 as the o(4)cp is approached with @xmath50 , although the divergent susceptibility is still the scalar one alone .",
    "the singular contribution to @xmath51 eventually blows up at the tcp approached along the o(4 ) critical line .",
    "in fact , the tcp may be understood as a usual critical point with the ordering density @xmath43 conjugate to @xmath33 , sitting on the chiral phase boundary .",
    "when the tcp is approached from the broken phase with @xmath52 , the scalar ordering density vanishes slowly @xmath53 , and @xmath46 and @xmath51 diverge like @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , while @xmath56 is still non - singular .",
    "note that the divergence of @xmath51 at the tcp indicates the infinities in the baryon number and energy susceptibilities , or equivalently the isothermal compressibility and specific heat , respectively .",
    "all these susceptibilities in ( [ eq : chimatrix ] ) diverge at the z@xmath3cp , where @xmath57 . with the finite condensate @xmath39 we can diagonalize this matrix of the susceptibilities , leaving only one singular susceptibility .",
    "the resulting eigenvalues are ( 0,0,@xmath58 ) , with eigenvectors @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , respectively . for small @xmath39 or @xmath25",
    ", we see that the ordering density is approximately a linear combination of the densities @xmath39 and @xmath43 .",
    "the fluctuations of these two ordering densities @xmath39 and @xmath43 become large near the tcp as explained above , and should be included as the soft degrees of freedom , especially when we discuss the dynamic aspects .",
    "we generalize the free energy so as to have two ordering densities , @xmath62 coupling between @xmath39 and @xmath43 must respect the underlying chiral symmetry and the simplest coupling is @xmath63 . a flat direction of this potential appears at a critical point in the @xmath39@xmath43 plane . in the case of the o(4)cp / tcp",
    "it is in the @xmath39 direction reflecting the symmetry while the direction will become a linear combination of the two densities at the z@xmath3cp . eliminating the density @xmath43 by @xmath64",
    ", we recover the original form ( [ eq : gleffpot ] ) of the free energy with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , up to an analytic term .",
    "we may introduce the dynamics to the system described by the free energy ( [ eq : gl2var ] ) phenomenologically@xcite .",
    "we have seen in the previous subsection that there are two ordering densities conjugate to the fields @xmath25 and @xmath33 at the tcp , and that a _ linear _ combination of these two densities will become the relevant ordering density at the z@xmath3cp for small @xmath25 or @xmath39 .",
    "we should include at least these two densities in order to describe the soft dynamics .",
    "furthermore , it is known that ( non  linear ) mode  mode coupling between the fluctuations of the ordering densities and other ( non - critical ) hydrodynamic modes are important in general to describe the dynamics in the critical region@xcite , which is beyond the scope of this work@xcite .",
    "we will see , however , that the coupled system of the two ordering densities in the mean field approximation yields already a non - trivial result@xcite .",
    "deviation of the densities from the absolute equilibrium gives rise to time evolution of the system .",
    "here we assume simple phenomenological equations of motion for densities @xmath39 and @xmath43 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the differential operators .",
    "appropriate forms of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are unknown in this description .",
    "but as a strong constraint we know that the operator @xmath71 must be consistent with the conservation of the density @xmath43 and describe the hydrodynamic motion . as a typical hydrodynamic evolution , we consider here the diffusion motion @xmath72 with wavevector @xmath10 .",
    "note that the diffusion is time  irreversible .",
    "we assume propagating motion @xmath73 for the scalar density , identifying this mode as the sigma meson which degenerates with the propagating pions at the o(4)cp / tcp .",
    "other possible forms are considered below in this section .",
    "the transport coefficients @xmath74 are treated as constants here .",
    "for small deviations @xmath75 and @xmath76 from the equilibrium values , we linearize these equations of motion with respect to @xmath77 and @xmath78 to obtain @xmath79 where @xmath80 , etc .",
    "the soft eigenmodes of the system are determined by the condition @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the scalar susceptibility given in ( [ eq : chih ] ) , and we introduced a term @xmath83 in @xmath84 .",
    "the eigenmodes for small @xmath10 are found as @xmath85 with @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the susceptibility of the density @xmath43 .",
    "the eigenmode @xmath88 is oscillating while @xmath89 has the diffusion - like hydrodynamic character .",
    "the @xmath88 vanishes at the o(4)cp , being the critical eigenmode .",
    "although the hydrodynamic mode @xmath89 is an intrinsic soft mode of the system , it does not show the critical slowing there . when the tcp is approached from the symmetric phase",
    ", the situation is the same . on the other hand , at the tcp approached from the broken phase , both frequencies slow down , reflecting the divergence of the susceptibilities , which seems reflecting the existence of two independent ordering densities there .    at the z@xmath3cp",
    "the susceptibilities @xmath82 and @xmath87 diverge with the same exponent due to the linear mixing .",
    "the propagating @xmath88 is a fast mode there due to the non - zero condensate @xmath90 , whereas the hydrodynamic slow mode @xmath91 becomes the critical mode ( @xmath92 ) associated with the z@xmath3cp .",
    "this result is similar to the level - crossing phenomenon where the mode coupling makes the lower energy mode lowered further .",
    "the explicit @xmath93 factor of @xmath89 stemming from the hydrodynamic character results in the larger dynamic critical exponent @xmath94 in the mean field level , which makes @xmath89 apparently slower than the @xmath88 mode .",
    "in contrast , at the o(4)cp , the linear mixing is banned by the underlying chiral symmetry .",
    "inverse of the differential operator ( [ eq : normal ] ) with the retarded boundary condition is the response function @xmath95 which characterizes the time ",
    "dependent response of these densities to the external fields , @xmath25 and @xmath96 , within the linear approximation .",
    "the susceptibility is obtained in the limit of @xmath97 .",
    "the response function is analytic in the upper complex@xmath98 plane , which fact allows us to express generally the susceptibility as a sum of the mode spectra@xcite : @xmath99 where a ultra  violet regularization is understood if necessary .",
    "this expression shows that the divergence at a critical point should come from an infrared enhancement of the spectral function because the spectral function itself is usually integrable .    using this expression",
    "we can examine the relative weight of each mode contribution to the susceptibility . in our case ,",
    "the oscillating and diffusion modes give spectral contributions as @xmath100 and @xmath101 here the first term in the bracket originates from the poles @xmath102 and the second from @xmath89 .",
    "first , we note that only the diffusion ",
    "like @xmath89 pole contributes to the susceptibility of @xmath43 .",
    "this is a robust result following from the conservation of the density @xmath43 .",
    "existence of the current @xmath103 such that @xmath104 dictates that the frequencies of the modes contributing to the @xmath43 susceptibility must vanish as @xmath10 goes to zero .",
    "we can formally show that the spectrum of the @xmath43 response function behaves as @xmath105 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "conversely , we can state that softening of the hydrodynamic mode must accompany the divergence of @xmath87 .",
    "second , the ratio of the @xmath89 spectral contribution to the total in the scalar susceptibility , @xmath106 goes to unity at the tcp approached from the broken phase and at the z@xmath3cp , which means that the leading divergence of the scalar susceptibility is also generated by the @xmath89 spectrum at these critical points . even at the o(4)cp",
    "approached from the broken phase the @xmath89 spectrum gives a finite portion of the divergence @xmath107 since @xmath108 .",
    "this result can be understood by rewriting the scalar response function as @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the denominator expresses the linear mixing between the `` bare '' @xmath77 and @xmath78 modes through the coupling @xmath112 . even though the coupling becomes smaller as the o(4)cp is approached from the broken phase , softening of the mediating `` bare ''",
    "@xmath77 propagator provides @xmath113 factor , which results in the finite mixing of the @xmath114 mode in the scalar channel .",
    "this is a simple example indicating the importance of the mode coupling near the critical point .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath77 and @xmath78 fluctuations mix and form two kinds of eigenmodes , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we find that along the o(4 ) critical line approached from the broken phase , the critical eigenmode shifts from the sigma  meson like @xmath88 to the diffusion like @xmath89 mode at the tcp . in contrast , when we approach the tcp from the symmetric phase , the scalar susceptibility @xmath82 is given completely by the critical @xmath88 spectrum without any mixing of the @xmath78 fluctuation . at the z@xmath3cp",
    "the @xmath88 mode becomes a fast mode whereas the whole divergence comes from the critical softening of the @xmath89 spectrum with the hydrodynamic character .      in more microscopic njl model calculation in the later section ,",
    "the mode with the hydrodynamic character is provided as the mode of landau - damping type , contrary to the macroscopic analysis in the previous subsection , and we may change the time evolution operator accordingly as @xmath115 . more generally , the sigma mode may be oscillating or relaxing ( @xmath116 or @xmath117 ) while the possible hydrodynamic fluctuation can be the diffusion , landau - damping type , or sound motion ( @xmath118 , or @xmath119 ) .",
    "furthermore , couplings with other hydrodynamic modes , if exist , are to be included to describe the correct dynamic behavior of the system@xcite .",
    "we stress here that our result on the critical eigenmodes at the critical points are independent on these ambiguities .",
