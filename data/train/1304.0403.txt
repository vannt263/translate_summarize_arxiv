    "the isogeometric analysis ( iga ) , proposed by hughes et al . in @xcite , has received great attention in the computational mechanics community . the concept has the capability of leading to large steps forward in computational efficiency since effectively , the process of re - meshing is either eliminated or greatly suppressed . the geometry description of the underlying domain is adopted from a computer aided design ( cad ) parametrization which is usually based on non - uniform rational b - splines ( nurbs ) , and the same basis functions are employed to approximate the physical solution . since its introduction , iga techniques have been studied and applied in diverse fields , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "moreover , some theoretical aspects such as approximation properties and condition number estimates have been studied , see @xcite .",
    "the isogeometric methods , depending on various choices of basis functions , have shown several advantages over standard finite element methods ( fem ) .",
    "for example , some common geometries arising in engineering and applied sciences , such as circles or ellipses , are exactly represented , and complicated geometries are represented more accurately than traditional polynomial based approaches .",
    "when we compare nurbs based isogeometric analysis with standard lagrange polynomials based finite element analysis , it leads to qualitatively more accurate results @xcite .",
    "another limitation of finite element analysis is that it suits well for @xmath7 continuous interpolation , but for @xmath8 or higher order interpolation finite elements are complicated and expensive to construct .",
    "iga offers @xmath9-continuous interpolation for @xmath4-degree basis functions with knot multiplicity @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the ease in building spaces with high inter - element regularity allows for rather small problem sizes ( in terms of degrees of freedom ) with respect to standard fem with the same approximation properties .",
    "this implies that , in general , for same approximation properties iga stiffness and mass matrices are smaller than the corresponding finite element ones",
    ". however , isogeometric matrices are denser than the fem matrices in realistic problems of interest , and their condition numbers grow quickly with the inverse of mesh size @xmath0 and the polynomial degree @xmath4 . a detailed study of condition number estimates for the stiffness matrix and mass matrix arising in isogeometric discretizations is given in @xcite . for the @xmath0-refinement , the condition number of the stiffness matrix is bounded from above and below by a constant times @xmath11 , and the condition number of the mass matrix is uniformly bounded . for the @xmath4-refinement , the condition number is bounded above by @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the stiffness matrix and the mass matrix , respectively , where @xmath14 is the dimension of the problem . as a consequence",
    ", the cost of solving the linear system of equations arising from the isogeometric discretization , particularly using iterative solvers , becomes an important issue .",
    "therefore , there is currently a growing interest in the design of efficient preconditioners for iga discrete problems , in both the mathematical and the engineering communities .",
    "multigrid methods for iga have been introduced for two and three dimensional elliptic problems by the authors in @xcite , and tearing and interconnecting methods for isogeometric analysis are discussed in @xcite . other recent work on solvers for iga studied overlapping additive schwarz methods @xcite and balancing domain decomposition by constraints methods @xcite . some issues arising in using direct solvers",
    "have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the results , we presented in @xcite , show optimal convergence rate with respect to the mesh parameter @xmath0 . however , for discretizations based on higher degree polynomials , the convergence rate are quickly deteriorated . in this paper",
    "we discuss the construction of linear solvers which provide not only @xmath0-independent convergence rates but also exhibit ( almost ) independence on @xmath4 .",
    "the presented optimal order solvers are based on algebraic multilevel iteration ( amli ) methods .",
    "amli methods were introduced by axelsson and vassilevski in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the amli methods , which are recursive extensions of two - level multigrid methods for fem @xcite , have been extensively analyzed in the context of conforming and nonconforming fem ( including discontinuous galerkin methods ) . for a detailed systematic exposition of amli methods ,",
    "see the monographs @xcite . to reduce the overall complexity of amli methods ( to achieve optimal computational complexity ) , various stabilization techniques can be used . in the original work @xcite ,",
    "the stabilization was achieved by employing properly shifted and scaled chebyshev polynomials .",
    "this approach requires the computation of polynomial coefficients which depends on the bounds of the eigenvalues of the preconditioned system .",
    "alternatively , some inner iterations at coarse levels can be used to stabilize the outer iterations , which lead to parameter - free amli methods @xcite .",
    "these methods utilize a sequence of coarse - grid problems that are obtained from repeated application of a natural ( and simple ) hierarchical basis transformation , which is computationally advantageous .",
    "moreover , the underlying technique of these methods often requires only a few minor adjustments ( mainly two - level hierarchical basis transformation ) even if the underlying problem changes significantly .    in this article",
    "we consider the scalar second order elliptic equation as our model problem .",
    "let @xmath15 , be an open , bounded and connected lipschitz domain with dirichlet boundary @xmath16 .",
    "we consider @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a uniformly bounded function for @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the space of test functions which vanish on @xmath16 , and @xmath21 denote the set which contains the functions fulfilling the dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath16 .",
    "by @xmath22 and @xmath23 we denote the finite - dimensional spaces of the b - spline ( nurbs ) basis functions . introducing the bilinear form @xmath24 and the linear form @xmath25 as @xmath26 the galerkin formulation of this problem reads :",
    "+ find @xmath27 such that @xmath28 it is well known that is a well - posed problem and has a unique solution . by approximating @xmath29 and @xmath30 using b - splines ( nurbs )",
    "the variational formulation is transformed in to a set of linear algebraic equations @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the stiffness matrix obtained from the bilinear form @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 @xmath35 denotes the vector of unknown degrees of freedom ( dof ) , and @xmath36 denotes the right hand side ( rhs ) vector from the known data of the problem . clearly , @xmath32 is a real symmetric positive definite matrix .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the basics of b - splines and nurbs .",
    "an explicit representation of basis functions is also given in this section .",
    "the description of multilevel representation of b - splines ( nurbs ) is given in section 3 .",
    "a brief description of amli methods is given in section 4 .",
    "we then construct the isogeometric hierarchical spaces in section 5 .",
    "numerical study of space splitting techniques is discussed in section 6 .",
    "the results of amli methods for several numerical experiments in two- and three - dimensions are presented in section 7 .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section 8 .",
    "we first recall the definition of b - splines , see e.g. @xcite .    [ def : bsplines ]",
    "let @xmath37 be a non - decreasing sequence of real numbers , called the @xmath38 @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the @xmath41 knot , @xmath4 is the polynomial degree , and @xmath42 is the number of basis function . with a knot vector in hand ,",
    "the b - spline basis functions , denoted by @xmath43 , are ( recursively ) defined starting with a piecewise constant    [ eq : defbsplines ] @xmath44    where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is considered as zero .",
    "the above expression is usually referred as the _ cox - de boor recursion formula _ , see e.g. @xcite . for a b - spline basis function of degree @xmath4",
    ", an interior knot can be repeated at most @xmath4 times , and the boundary knots can be repeated at most @xmath47 times .",
    "a knot vector for which the two boundary knots are repeated @xmath47 times is said to be open . in this case , the basis functions are interpolatory at the first and the last knot .",
    "important properties of the b - spline basis functions include nonnegativity , partition of unity , local support and @xmath9-continuity .",
    "[ def : bsplinecurve ] a b - spline curve @xmath48 , is defined by @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the control points and @xmath51 are b - spline basis functions defined in ( [ eq : defbsplines ] ) .",
    "the previous definitions are easily generalized to the higher dimensional cases by means of tensor product . using tensor product of one - dimensional b - spline functions , a b - spline surface @xmath52",
    "is defined as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , denote the control points , @xmath57 is the tensor product of b - spline basis functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the corresponding knot vectors .",
    "similarly , b - spline solids can be defined by a three - dimensional tensor product .      while b - splines ( polynomials ) are flexible and have many nice properties for curve design , they are also incapable of exactly representing curves such as circles , ellipses , etc .",
    "such limitations are overcome by nurbs functions .",
    "rational representation of conics originates from projective geometry and requires additional parameters called weights , which we shall denote by @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 be a set of control points for a projective b - spline curve in @xmath64 .",
    "for the desired nurbs curve in @xmath65 , the weights and the control points are derived by the relations @xmath66 where @xmath67 is called the @xmath68 weight and @xmath69 is the @xmath70-dimension component of the vector @xmath71 .",
    "the weight function @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73 then , the nurbs basis functions and curve are defined by @xmath74 the nurbs surfaces are analogously defined as follows @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the tensor product of nurbs basis functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , nurbs solids can be defined by a three - dimensional tensor product .",
    "nurbs functions also satisfy the properties of b - spline functions . for a detailed exposition",
    "see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the recursive form of b - spline basis functions , given by , is elegant and concise , and is presented in all the iga related references , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , this form may not be the most efficient from computational point of view , specially when dealing with large knot vectors .",
    "therefore , in the cad community , there have been considerable efforts for efficient nurbs evaluation techniques , for latest advances see , e.g. , optimized gpu evaluation of nurbs curves and surfaces @xcite and references therein .",
    "to the best of authors knowledge , within the iga literature there is no reference on the explicit representation of b - splines for a given mesh size @xmath0 .",
    "however , there are situations , e.g. in academic problems , where having an explicit representation of b - spline basis functions is of significant importance",
    ". therefore , we present the explicit form of b - splines in terms of the mesh size ( knot - span ) @xmath0 .",
    "having an explicit form of basis functions is also advantageous in devising inter - grid transfer operators for multigrid and multilevel iterative solvers . for brevity reasons ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a unit interval with equal spacing .",
    "moreover , as most of the nurbs based designs in engineering use polynomial degree @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we will confine ourselves up to @xmath81 with @xmath7 and @xmath3 continuous basis functions .",
    "we first consider the @xmath3 continuous case as this is the default case for knot vector with non - repeated internal knots . for b - spline functions with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we have the same representation as for standard piecewise constant and linear finite element functions , respectively .",
    "quadratic b - spline basis functions , however , differ from their fem counterparts .",
    "they are each identical but shifted related to each other , whereas the shape of a quadratic finite element function depends on whether it corresponds to an internal node or an end node .",
    "this `` homogeneous '' pattern continues for the b - splines with higher - degrees .",
    "we are interested to give an explicit representation for uniform b - spline basis functions defined on a knot vector @xmath84 at any given level @xmath10 , where @xmath85 with spacing @xmath0 @xmath86 , where @xmath42 is the total number of knot spans .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath87 for b - splines , where superscripts represent the polynomial degree and the regularity of basis functions , respectively , and the subscripts represent the level and the number of basis function , respectively .",
    "we start with level @xmath88 with only one element . using the definition from , at level @xmath88 the b - spline basis functions of degree @xmath79 on the knot vector @xmath89",
    "are defined as follows @xmath90 the mesh refinement takes place by inserting the knots .",
    "we consider uniform refinement of @xmath91 , i.e. inserting knots at the mid point of the knot values . at the next level @xmath92 ,",
    "the basis functions on refined knot vector @xmath93 are given by @xmath94 @xmath95 further refinements take place in a similar way , i.e. , starting with @xmath91 , a single knot span , in the knot span @xmath84 we will thus have @xmath96 knot spans . the explicit representation of b - splines at level @xmath10 , where @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 @xmath99 for higher degree polynomials , we can define the explicit representation in a similar way . again using the definition of b - splines , for @xmath100 , at first level @xmath101 ,",

    "the knot values are repeated upto a desired level . by repeating the internal knots @xmath10 times",
    "we get the @xmath9 continuous basis functions . in the previous section",
    "we have given the explicit representation for @xmath3 continuity , which is the highest continuity for polynomial degree @xmath4 .",

    "we have presented matrix form of these operators . as the choice of hierarchical complementary spaces is not unique ,",
