    "quantum key distribution  ( qkd ) enables two distant partners , alice and bob , to share common secret keys in the presence of an eavesdropper , eve  @xcite . in theory",
    ", the unconditional security of qkd protocol is guaranteed based on the laws of physics , in particular the no - cloning theorem .",
    "but in practice , the key components of practical qkd systems have imperfections that do not fulfill the assumptions of ideal devices in theoretical security proofs . in discrete - variable qkd , the imperfect devices such as single photon detectors , phase modulators , faraday mirrors and fiber beam splitters , open security loopholes to eve and lead to various types of attacks  @xcite .",
    "continuous - variable  ( cv ) qkd  @xcite has developed immensely over the past decade  @xcite to the point that there are companies selling commercially available systems  @xcite .",
    "even so , cv - qkd is potentially vulnerable to such idealization - to - practical problems that plague its discrete variable counterpart . in the cv - qkd protocols , alice encodes the key information onto the quadratures , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , on a bunch of coherent states and sends them onto bob .",
    "bob measures one or both quadratures by performing homodyne  @xcite or heterodyne detection  @xcite on the signal with a relatively strong local oscillator  ( lo ) .",
    "finally , they perform direct or reverse reconciliation and privacy amplification process to distill a common secret key  @xcite . in practice",
    ", it is extremely difficult for bob to generate the lo with the same initial polarization and phase to alice s signal .",
    "therefore , alice prepares both the signal and lo , and send them to bob in the same optical fiber channel at the same time to avoid the large drifts of the relative polarization and phase  @xcite .",
    "however , this implementation leaves a security loophole open for eve .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors proposed an equal - amplitude attack . to perform this attack , eve first intercepts the signal and lo , and measures both of the quadratures by performing heterodyne detection on them . according to her measurement results ,",
    "she reproduces two weak squeezed states which have the same intensity level to the signal , and sends them onto bob .",
    "bob treats these two fake states as signal and lo , and performs detections on them as usual .",
    "but now the detection is neither homodyne nor heterodyne detection , therefore eve is able to make the extra noise of bob s measurement much lower than the shot noise level . as a result ,",
    "the total deviation between bob s measurement and alice s preparation is lower than the tolerable threshold derived from the theoretical security proofs  @xcite .",
    "hence alice and bob can not discover the presence of eve .    in order to prevent this attack without modifying the original measurement setup , bob needs to monitor the total intensity or the lo intensity  @xcite .",
    "we note that in this attack , eve is assumed to be unable to control the beam splitters of bob .",
    "but in one of our recent studies  @xcite , we found that it is possible for eve to control the outputs of fiber beam splitters by utilizing its wavelength dependent property  @xcite .",
    "importantly , such wavelength dependent properties can be found in commercial cv - qkd systems  @xcite . making use of this loophole",
    ", we propose a new wavelength attack on a practical cv - qkd system using heterodyne detection protocol  @xcite . by using this attack eve can in principle achieve all of the secret key without being discovered , even if bob has monitored the total intensity or the lo intensity .",
    "such an attack has practical and commercial consequences .    in the security analysis of cv - qkd protocols with direct ( reverse ) reconciliation , @xmath2(@xmath3 ) , alice ( bob ) s conditional variance of bob ( alice ) , has the similar status as the quantum bit error rate  ( qber ) in the discrete - variable qkd protocols . to show that the hidden eve would not be discovered in our attack",
    ", our method is proving that the upper bound of @xmath2  ( @xmath3 ) under our wavelength attack is always lower than the maximum value allowed by the secret key rate formula  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ preliminary ] , we first review the heterodyne protocol and the wavelength - dependent property of certain fiber beam splitters , then we propose a wavelength attack scheme on an all - fiber cv - qkd system using heterodyne protocol in section  [ wavelength attack ] .",
    "we prove the feasibility of this wavelength attack in section  [ feasibility analysis ] , and finally conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in the heterodyne protocol  @xcite , alice first prepares a displaced vacuum state that will be sent to bob .",
    "this is realized by choosing two real numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 from a gaussian distribution of variance @xmath6 and zero mean .",
    "the whole ensemble of coherent states alice will send to bob is given by the thermal state with variance @xmath7 .",
    "bob receives this coherent state and simultaneously measures both the amplitude and phase quadratures of the state using heterodyne detection . after repeating this process many times",
    ", they finally extract a binary secret key by using either direct reconciliation  @xcite or reverse reconciliation algorithm  @xcite .",
    "a typical cv - qkd system using heterodyne protocol can be realized by the schematic shown in fig .",
    "[ figure schematic 1 ] . in this scheme ,",
    "time and polarization multiplexing are used so that the signal and lo can be transmitted in the same channel without interfering . to avoid the equal - amplitude attack  @xcite ,",
    "bob uses a 10:90 beam splitter(not depicted in the figure ) before the polarization beam splitter to monitor the lo intensity@xcite .    to perform the heterodyne detection ,",
    "bob uses the photo - detector to convert the photons into a photocurrent @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath8 and the photon number @xmath9 are related by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the annihilation and creation operators of the light state , and q is a suitable constant  @xcite .",
    "the extra quantum noise @xmath13 is unavoidable in bob s measurement results when he uses heterodyne detection due to the unused port of the @xmath14 beam splitter . to show this ,",
    "let us first describe the signal and lo by operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "these operators can be broken up into two contributions  @xcite : the mean values of the amplitude @xmath17 as well as the quantum noise fluctuations @xmath18 .",
    "the operators can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are complex numbers and we assume that the amplitude of the lo is much larger than the signal , i.e. , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the fluctuations of the signal and lo , respectively .",
    "the photocurrents read by the four photo - detectors can be written as follows @xmath25\\times\\\\&[e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}(\\alpha_{lo } + \\delta\\hat{\\alpha}'_{lo } ) + \\alpha_s + \\delta\\hat{\\alpha}'_s]/4,\\\\ \\hat{i}_4 & = q[e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}(\\alpha_{lo}^ * + \\delta\\hat{\\alpha}_{lo}^{'\\dag } ) - \\alpha_s^ * - \\delta\\hat{\\alpha}_s^{'\\dag}]\\times\\\\&[e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}(\\alpha_{lo } + \\delta\\hat{\\alpha}'_{lo } ) - \\alpha_s - \\delta\\hat{\\alpha}'_s]/4 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] here we have absorbed the vacuum noise terms @xmath13 into the terms @xmath26 . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath21 is a real number . to derive the quadratures @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the difference of the two photocurrents",
    "should be measured @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the exact quadratures that bob wants to measure , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the quantum noises entering into bob s measurement .",
    "several terms have been neglected above according to the fact that @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfy the canonical commutation relation @xmath34 = 2i$ ] , therefore the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath35 is derivable  @xcite .    under the condition that eve can not act on the lo ( a common assumption in the security proofs  @xcite ) , it is only when the excess noise reaches two times the shot - noise level that eve can perform an intercept - resend attack on the channel  @xcite .",
    "it is due to the fact that eve will introduce vacuum noise by using heterodyne detection and consequently , suffer the quantum fluctuations when she reproduces the signal state in a simple intercept - resend attack .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the wavelength - dependent property of the fiber beam splitter which is made by the fused biconical taper technology @xcite .",
    "the fused biconical taper beam splitter is made by closing two or more bare optical fibers , fusing them in a high temperature environment and drawing their two ends at the same time .",
    "subsequently , a specific biconic tapered waveguide structure can be formed in the heating area .",
    "the fused biconical taper beam splitter is widely use in the fiber qkd systems because of the feature of low insertion loss , good directivity and low cost .",
    "however , intensity transmission of the fused biconical taper beam splitter is wavelength - dependent , and most types of fused biconical taper beam splitters work only in a limited range of wavelengths ( limited bandwidths ) , where the intensity transmission of the beam splitter can be defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is output light intensity from beam splitter s output port 1 ( 2 ) . typical coupling ratio at the center wavelength provides optimal performance , but the intensity transmission varies periodically with wavelength changes .",
    "the relationship between wavelength @xmath39 and the intensity transmission @xmath40 by using the coupling model is given in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fraction of power coupled , @xmath43 is the coupling coefficient , and @xmath44 is the heat source width .",
    "the basic idea of the wavelength attack is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "eve intercepts the coherent states sent by alice .",
    "she makes heterodyne measurement of the signal using the lo to achieve the quadrature values @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "after that , eve generates and re - sends three coherent states : a fake signal state @xmath47 , a fake lo state @xmath48 and together with a ancillary state @xmath49 .",
    "different from the previous intercept - resend attack , these fake states have different wavelengthes , denoted as @xmath50 ( for @xmath47 ) , @xmath51 ( for @xmath48 ) and @xmath52 ( for @xmath49 ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) , the performance of bob s beam splitter is dependent on the wavelength of the incoming light .",
    "therefore the fake signal with wavelength @xmath50 , the transmission of bob s beam splitter is determined by the function @xmath53 which is defined in eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) .",
    "similarly , the intensity transmission of bob s beam splitter to the fake lo state is determined by @xmath54 . in other words , eve can control bob s beam splitter by tuning the wavelength of her fake states .    with the help of the wavelength tunable laser diodes and intensity modulators , the wavelength and amplitude of these fake states",
    "are carefully chosen to satisfy the following conditions @xmath55 where @xmath56(i = 1,2 ) ,",
    "t'_j \\equiv t'(\\lambda_j ) \\in [ 0,1](j=1,2,3)$ ] . here",
    "@xmath57 is the channel transmission efficiency , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the amplitudes of the original signal and the lo , respectively , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the amplitudes of the fake signal and the fake lo , @xmath63 are the intensity transmissions of bob s 10:90 beam splitter ( for monitoring the lo light intensity ) .    condition ( i ) makes sure the method of monitoring the lo intensity is invalid to eve . here",
    "we assume that bob uses a 10:90 beam splitter to split the total light before being inserted into the pbs  @xcite .",
    "because the 10:90 beam splitter is also wavelength - dependent , its intensity transmission can be determined by a function similar to eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) , which is denoted by @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath49 is used for compensating the intensity when @xmath65 and @xmath66 are both small .",
    "eve selects an appropriate wavelength @xmath52 such that @xmath67 , therefore the intensity of @xmath49 is much lower than the shot noise level and negligible .    as bob measures the quadratures @xmath68 and @xmath69 by performing heterodyne detection on the fake signal and the fake lo , conditions ( ii ) and ( iii )",
    "make bob s measurement results coincide with the ones attained by eve . to see explicitly where these relations come from , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq appen 1 ] ) and ( [ eq appen 2 ] ) in the appendix .",
    "notice that the fake signal and the fake lo have different wavelengths , and hence , no interference occurs in this detection .",
    "the effect of this on the measurement detection is that we no longer have heterodyne detection outputs but rather outputs that are proportional to eve s measurements .",
    "therefore , the photocurrents recorded by the photo - detectors consist of parts from the signal and the lo .",
    "eve should also make @xmath70 and @xmath71 much smaller than @xmath72 in order to suppress the shot noise .",
    "we are going to prove in section  [ feasibility analysis ] that the extra noise introduced by bob s measurement is much lower than the shot - noise level , therefore the total noise can be kept under the alarm threshold . in other words , eve can safely achieve the key information without being discovered by alice or bob .    finally , we note that as there are limitations on the intensities , conditions ( ii ) and ( iii ) may not always be satisfied .",
    "however , as the analysis in appendix .  [ appendix 2 ] , we find that the probability of failing condition ( ii ) or ( iii ) is extremely close to zero .",
    "to analyze the feasible of the wavelength attack , we first note that the following assumptions should be satisfied :    \\(1 ) this attack is restricted to an all - fiber coherent - state cv - qkd using heterodyne protocol .",
    "\\(2 ) all of bob s beam splitters have the same wavelength dependent property , i.e. , their intensity transmissions are all determined by eq.([bs ] ) with the same parameters .",
    "this function and the detection efficiencies of bob s detectors are both known by eve . here",
    "we assume that the detection efficiencies are wavelength independent for simplicity .",
    "in practice , eve can simply absorb the differences into the light amplitudes modulated by her and the final results are unchanged .",
    "\\(3 ) eve has the ability to replace the quantum channel with a noiseless fiber , and her detectors have high efficiency and negligible excess noise .    before analyzing the feasibility of the wavelength attack ,",
    "let us first rapidly review the security analysis of the gaussian protocols based on coherent states and heterodyne detections under individual attacks . in what follows , we restrict ourselves to gaussian attacks which are proven optimal  @xcite",
    ".    in the case of gaussian attacks , the channel connecting alice and bob can be fully characterized by its transmission @xmath57 , and its excess noise @xmath73 above the shot noise level , such that the total noise measured by bob is @xmath74 ( in shot noise units )  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may use the total added noise defined as @xmath75 for convenience .",
    "the secret key rates for heisenberg - limited individual attack in direct reconciliation and reverse reconciliation are given , respectively , by  @xcite @xmath76}{(1 + \\chi v)[1 + \\eta(1+\\chi)]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath77},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the variance of alice s modulated state as it was mentioned in sec.ii.a .",
    "note that we use the ` heisenberg - limited attack ' rather than the optimal attack  @xcite as such an attack upper bounds eve s information thereby emphasizing our wavelength attack which can even beat such a stringent attack . from the above formulas",
    ", we can see that when v and @xmath57 are settled in practice , the secret key rate is fully determined by @xmath79 , which can be precisely estimated from the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "another important parameter in the security proof is alice s ( bob s ) conditional variance of bob s ( alice s ) measurement @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) in direct reconciliation ( reverse reconciliation),which can be thought of as the uncertainty in alice s ( bob s ) estimates of bob s ( alice s ) quadrature measurement result . in the cv - qkd ,",
    "alice and bob use @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) to estimate the shot noise and modulation imperfections  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is defined(where both quadratures are symmetrized ) as @xmath80 and similarly , we have @xmath3 defined as @xmath81 we note that @xmath2(@xmath3 ) performs a role in cv - qkd protocols similar as the quantum bit error rate in discrete variable qkd protocols , which provide alice and bob an intuitive tool to detect the presence of eve .",
    "to clarify this idea , let us first state the relation between @xmath2(@xmath3 ) and @xmath79 . as the gaussian character of the channel maintains no matter eve performs the gaussian attacks or not , the conditional variance between alice and bob , which we will denote as @xmath82 and @xmath83 , can be calculated as follows  @xcite @xmath84}{\\eta(v+\\chi)+1},\\\\ v_{b|a}^{normal }   & = \\frac{1}{2}[\\eta(1+\\chi)+1].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that there may be a little different from the expressions in  @xcite due to the differences on the definitions of v.    on the other hand , to make the secret key rate positive , we require that ( according to eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) and  ( [ r2 ] ) ) @xmath85 with @xmath86 for direct reconciliation or @xmath87 with @xmath88 for reverse reconciliation , should be satisfied .",
    "combining eq .",
    "( [ noise1 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi max dr ] ) , we can find that for the sake of deriving a positive secret key rate , the upper bound of @xmath82 yields @xmath89 in other words , if @xmath2 is smaller than this threshold , the heterodyne protocol in direct reconciliation is considered to be secure .",
    "similarly , the upper bound of @xmath83 is derived to be @xmath90 and the heterodyne protocol in reverse reconciliation is considered to be secure if @xmath3 is smaller than this threshold .    for these reasons , we can prove our attack feasible by showing that eve",
    "can make @xmath91 ( in the direct reconciliation protocol ) and @xmath92 ( in the reverse reconciliation protocol ) when she is performing the wavelength attack .",
    "when eve performs the wavelength attack , with channel noise , from a real value @xmath4 chosen by alice to the measurement result @xmath68 achieved by bob is listed as follows ( we write down the quadrature @xmath0 only since the other quadrature @xmath1 can be presented in the similar way ) @xmath93 where @xmath94 represents the vacuum noise in eve s heterodyne detection whose variance is normalized to @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the vacuum noise introduced by the heterodyne detection .",
    "the variance of each of the terms is given by : @xmath97 and @xmath98 . here",
    "@xmath99 can then be considered as eve s conditional variance of bob s measurement result . in appendix  [",
    "appendix 1 ] , we derive the value of @xmath99 and show that it is smaller than 0.13 .",
    "we are now ready to derive the conditional variances under eve s attack , which are denoted as @xmath100 and @xmath101 .      according to the definition of @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ vab ] ) , the value of @xmath100 can be computed as follows @xmath102 combining with eq .",
    "( [ vnbx],[vnbp ] ) and the discussions above , we can estimate that the value of @xmath100 is not larger than 1.9 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( where we set @xmath103 and @xmath104  @xcite ) , @xmath100 is always lower than @xmath105 , so that alice and bob can never discover the eavesdropper under this attack .",
    "besides , one should notice that @xmath100 is always lower than the normal level when the channel loss is larger than @xmath106  db , therefore eve should increase the deviations on purpose to make @xmath100 close to @xmath82 in order to avoid suspicion .",
    "in reverse reconciliation , using eq .",
    "( [ vba ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : presence of eve ] ) , the value of @xmath101 can be computed as @xmath107 combining with eq .",
    "( [ vnbx],[vnbp ] ) and the discussions above , we can estimate that the value of @xmath101 is never larger than @xmath108 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( where again we have set @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) , it is always lower than the value of @xmath109 so that alice and bob can never discover the eavesdropper under such an attack . besides",
    ", one should notice that @xmath101 is lower than the @xmath83 when the channel loss is larger than @xmath106  db .",
    "hence , eve should increase the deviations to make @xmath100 close to @xmath82 in order to avoid suspicions .",
    "there are two points about the wavelength attack that should be remarked :    1 .   as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are lower than @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively when @xmath110 .",
    "it is impossible when the protocol works normally , therefore eve should add extra noise on her measurement result to increase @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "so that perfect heterodyne detection is not necessary for eve . in other words , assumption ( 3 ) listed in section  [ feasibility analysis ] can be compromised .",
    "2 .   in theory",
    ", the wavelength attack can not be avoided by adding wavelength filter before the monitoring detector , because eve can simply increase the input light intensity  @xcite . to make this method work ,",
    "bob should randomly choose to add or not to add a wavelength filter before the monitoring detector and observe the differences .",
    "finally , we note that a commercial cv - qkd system , as sold by  @xcite , currently uses a wavelength - dependent beam splitter .",
    "although , it does not fall into the regime studied in this paper because it uses homodyne detection rather than heterodyne detection .",
    "however , our results show that if one were going to use heterodyne detection with a commercial qkd unit , then the precautions mentioned here would need to be taken .",
    "furthermore , possible quantum hacking opportunities with homodyne detection and wavelength - dependent beam splitters warrant further investigation .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have proposed a new type of realistic quantum hacking attack , namely the wavelength attack , on continuous - variable qkd systems using heterodyne detection .",
    "if alice and bob do nt take the necessary precautions for such an attack , the final secret key is in principle , totally insecure as eve can obtain all the information about the final key .",
    "this is different from the equal - amplitude attack proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite as in the wavelength attack , eve has the ability to control bob s beam splitter and therefore the suggestion of testing the total intensity in ref .",
    "@xcite would not prevent such an attack from occurring .",
    "to close such a loophole in practical cv - qkd systems , it is simply enough for bob to randomly add a wavelength filter before his detection .",
