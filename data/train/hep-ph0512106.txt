    "over recent years , interest in compton scattering with two virtual ( typically , space - like ) photons has arisen and has been constantly growing .",
    "this interest is based on significant progress in precision electron - proton scatering experimental technique .",
    "polarization transfer data for elastic electron - proton scattering @xcite showed that the extracted values of the electromagnetic form factors obtained with this technique differ significantly from the rosenbluth separation data @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that these two data sets may be reconciled by the proper inclusion of higher order contributions in the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath3 , namely the two photon exchange contribution @xcite .",
    "several model calculations using the elastic form factors only @xcite , the @xmath4 resonance @xcite , and the partonic picture @xcite , show that the contribution of the two photon exchange exhibits the correct trend which may be enough to explain the discrepancy of the experimental results . on the other hand ,",
    "a different class of observables has become experimentally accessible in the framework of parity - violating electron - proton scattering .",
    "these new observables involve the spin orientation normal to the reaction plane and have been shown to be directly related to the imaginary part of the elastic electron - proton scattering amplitude . since one photon exchange",
    "does not lead to an imaginary part , the leading order contribution comes from the exchange of at least two photons @xcite .",
    "since the exchange of three or more photons is suppressed by powers of the small coupling constant @xmath5 , a measurement of such an observable probably provides the cleanest way to access compton scattering with two virtual photons . at present ,",
    "several experimental data points exist in different kinematical regimes @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "significant progress has been made towards quantitative understanding of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "+ these experimental and theoretical studies require a description of compton scattering with two virtual photons .",
    "the general form of the explicitly gauge invariant basis for vvcs was developed in the 1970 s by tarrach @xcite .",
    "the invariant amplitudes of tarrach have the advantage that they do nt have kinematical singularities nor constraints , and thus can be used for a dispersion calculation .",
    "however , they were never used for a realistic calculation .",
    "one of the reasons is that , at that time , the vvcs reaction was of pure theoretical interest ( apart from its forward limit which is used in dis and described by the nucleon structure functions rather than the invariant amplitudes of tarrach ) .",
    "the other reason is the technical difficulty in using this basis in a real calculation , which is due to the non - orthogonality of the basis tensors .",
    "another approach was used by prange for real compton scattering @xcite and then generalized to compton scattering with a virtual initial photon by berg and lindner @xcite .",
    "this method consists in defining the invariant compton basis in terms of gauge invariant basis tensors which are orthogonal to each other . in this work ,",
    "we generalize this approach to the case when the outgoing photon is also virtual . in section",
    "[ sec : vvcs_tensor ] , we introduce the vvcs tensor in such a form , and study the properties of the invariant amplitudes .",
    "we also consider the special case of elastic vvcs with initial and outgoing photons of equal virtuality . in the literature ,",
    "the invariant compton tensor for this reaction exists only for the forward case .",
    "we obtain here the result for the general case . in section",
    "[ sec : appl_bn ] , we use the introduced from of the compton tensor for a practical calculation of the beam normal spin asymmetry @xmath2 in the forward kinematics .",
    "in this section , the doubly virtual compton scattering ( vvcs ) tensor will be introduced and the properties of the invariant vvcs amplitudes will be investigated .",
    "we start by reviewing existing developments on invariant compton tensors .",
    "a general lorentz and gauge - invariant vvcs tensor was constructed by tarrach @xcite with the corresponding amplitudes free from kinematical singularities and constraints .",
    "however , it appears problematic to use this tensor basis for practical calculations .",
    "therefore , we turn to the method used by prange for rcs @xcite and extended to vcs ( with only one virtual photon ) by berg and lindner @xcite .",
    "we consider a scattering process @xmath6 and define the four - vectors : p&= & + & = & + l&=&=. the method of ref.@xcite for rcs amounts to defining two orthogonal vectors , p^&=&p^-^ , + n^&=&^p__l _ , where we use the convention @xmath7 .",

    "the reason for this agreement is that every factor @xmath86 in the numerator actually leads to an extra suppression in @xmath47 , as can be seen , if comparing the integrals @xmath76 to @xmath87 and @xmath88 to @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "the integrals are given in the appendix .",
    "if using as input the exact forward value of the imaginary part of the compton amplitude , to go to finite values of @xmath47 , one needs a phenomenological information in order to consistently describe the off - forward compton scattering .",
    "we use the same approach as @xcite .",
    "it is based on the phenomenological exponential fit of the @xmath47-dependence of the compton differential cross section for values of @xmath47 from 0 through -0.8 gev@xmath90 . since @xmath91 ,",
    "t(t)=_t(0)e^bt/2 , with @xmath92 gev@xmath93 . for the energy dependence of @xmath94",
    ", we use the phenomenological fit of ref .",
    "we present our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : bn ] .     as function of the momentum transfer @xmath95",
    "are shown for four values of the @xmath96 beam energy : 3 gev ( solid lines ) , 6 gev ( dashed lines ) , 12 gev ( dotted lines ) , and 45 gev ( dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "the thick lines correspond to the full @xmath47-dependence of eq.([eq : bn_fullresult ] ) , while the thin lines correspond to the leading @xmath47 behaviour of eq.([eq : bn_smallt]).,title=\"fig:\",height=340 ]    as seen from the figure , the more accurate account on the @xmath47 dependence leads to faster decreasing of the asymmetry with increasing @xmath95 .",
    "we predict therefore lower negative values for @xmath2 than the authors of @xcite .",
    "as function of the momentum transfer @xmath95 for the neutron target .",
    "notation as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bn].,title=\"fig:\",height=340 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bn_neutron ] , results for @xmath2 on the neutron target are shown .",
    "the asymmetry is only about twice smaller for the neutron than for the proton , which is due to the overall factor of @xmath97 .",
    "since also the cross section in the denominator is much smaller for the neutron target at low @xmath95 than for the proton , it means that a measurement of the cross section difference in the numerator of the @xmath2 would be a very challenging task for the neutron target .",
    "in summary , we constructed the invariant basis for doubly virtual compton scattering ( vvcs ) . in the general case ,",
    "vvcs is described by means of 18 independent invariant amplitudes which are functions of the invariants @xmath98 .",
    "the proposed form of the vvcs tensor does not exist in the literature .",
    "this form is based on lorentz and gauge invariance and consists of constructing 9 orthogonal basis tensors , which are useful for practical calculations .",
    "we furthermore investigated the behaviour of the vvcs amplitudes under photon and nucleon crossing . basing on this crossing behaviour",
    ", it is possible to obtain the correct form of the vvcs basis in the case of elastic vvcs ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) where only 12 amplitudes survive .",
    "the special case of elastic vvcs is realized in the case of the calculation of the beam normal spin asymmetry @xmath2 with forward kinematics .",
    "we provide the calculation for this observable with these kinematics . since in the exact forward limit this observable vanishes , one has to use the full amplitude for this calculation .",
    "we project the compton helicity amplitudes onto the invariant basis and use as input the optical theorem .",
    "it relates the imaginary part of the helicity amplitudes @xmath99 and @xmath100 to the transverse @xmath94 and the longitudinal @xmath1 cross sections , respectively .",
    "the longitudinal cross section is then related to the transverse one by means of the callan - cross relation .",
    "the resulting asymmetry is of the order of @xmath101 ppm and is practically independent of the electron energy .",
    "the presented formalism may be furthermore extended to the two photon exchange contributions to other observables .",
    "this work was supported by the us department of energy contract doe - fg02 - 05er 41361 .",
    "in a real calculation , one needs to calculate the single amplitudes contributions from , for instance , a feynman diagram . for this",
    ", one can make use of the fact that all the basis tensors are orthogonal .",
