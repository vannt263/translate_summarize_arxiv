    "<S> spin currents are driven through vertical stacks from a magnetic polarizer via a non - magnetic spacer into a recording magnet to facilitate reading and writing of the information @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spin conservation across the spacer is an essential prerequisite for these functionalities . </S>",
    "<S> recent discoveries showed that a non - magnetic layer alone can be turned into an efficient injector of the spin - current to the adjacent magnetic layer by relativistic electrical transport means , namely by the spin hall effect @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the spin - conserving length - scale defines the active width of the non - magnetic layer from which the spin - current can reach the interface with the magnet . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic spin - transport lengths in these vertical spin - transport devices are often limited to nanoscale by scattering from magnetic impurities or by strong spin - orbit coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> the limitation to nanoscale lengths can be afforded in the vertical devices comprising thin - film stacks . </S>",
    "<S> however , the spatial - resolution scale of common electrical or optical probes that can be used to directly measure non - local spin - transport between an injector and a detector in lateral structures is orders of magnitude larger . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , also the fabrication of lateral spin - transistors and more complex spin - logic devices @xcite relies on systems with spin - conserving length - scales approaching or , ideally , exceeding microns . </S>",
    "<S> the long - range nature of spin - transport , in combination with the desired high speed of these devices , inherently brings not only the requirement on the long spin life - time but also implies that electrons carrying the spin information were highly mobile .    in semiconductors like gaas , </S>",

    "<S> the spin decay channel due to electron - hole recombination is suppressed by a built - in electric field which drives photo - generated holes towards the gaas surface while the photo - electrons are driven in the opposite direction towards the algaas barrier . </S>",

    "<S> the observation suggests that the highly mobile long - lived electron system is present before the arrival of each pump pulse ( separated from the preceding pulse by 200  @xmath14s ) and , therefore , it exhibits a fully suppressed electron - hole recombination . after being temporarily disturbed by the pump </S>",

    "<S> the simplicity of our bare gaas / algaas structure , compared to earlier attempts focusing on more elaborate doping , gating , heterostructure , or micro - patterning designs , opens a new perspective for the research of spin transport in semiconductors . since undoped gaas / algaas interfaces have been commonly embedded in a variety of previously studied structures , our results may also prompt revisiting earlier experiments . as we highlight below </S>",
