    "effective field theory is indispensable to describe physical processes at energy lower than the characteristic scale of theory , especially when the microscopic physics is too complicated to be used as in the case of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite or just unknown as in the standard model . since",
    "effective field theory has been very useful and successful in explaining the low energy data , it has now become an everyday language in physics  @xcite .",
    "color superconductivity in cold and dense quark matter  @xcite has been studied quite intensively in recent years by using effective field theory methods  @xcite .",
    "most important ingredient in those studies was the existence of effective four - quark interactions that mimic the four - fermion interaction generated by phonon exchange in bcs superconductivity , which are assumed to be generated in the effective lagrangian either by exchange of massive gluons  @xcite or by strongly coupled instantons  @xcite . for low density",
    "quark matter , where strong interaction is no longer weak , such four - fermi interactions may describe qcd at low density as model interactions , thus leading to color superconducting gap of qcd scale ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "but , it was recently argued quite convincingly by son  @xcite that at least for high density quark matter , where perturbative qcd is applicable , magnetic gluons are not debye - screened but only dynamically screened or landau damped . such long - range magnetic gluon interaction is more important and leads to a bigger cooper - pair gap , @xmath4 , than the usual bcs gap , which is subsequently confirmed by the schwinger - dyson analysis for the cooper - pair gap  @xcite .",
    "recently , an effective field theory of qcd at high density  @xcite is derived systematically in the power expansion of @xmath5 by integrating out the anti - quarks which are decoupled at low energy in dense quark matter . in the effective theory ,",
    "four - quark operators are generated at the one - loop matching and the electric gluons are screened due to quarks in the fermi sea while the magnetic gluons are not at least in perturbation  @xcite . at scales below the electric screening mass , the relevant interactions for quarks are the coupling with magnetic gluons and the four - quark interaction with opposite momenta . both interactions for quarks in the color anti - triplet channel with opposite momenta are shown to lead to color superconductivity  @xcite .    according to the quark - hadron phase continuity in qcd , conjectured recently by schfer and wilczek  @xcite , the confining phase of nuclear matter at low density is complementary to the higgs phase quark matter at high density .",
    "we support this conjecture by showing that in the effective theory , which is equivalent to qcd in the asymptotic density , the color - flavor locking diquark condensate is energetically more preferred .",
    "furthermore , in the effective theory , the higher order corrections are systematically calculable and one can easily estimate quantities like the critical density , which are determined by the sub - leading operators in @xmath0 expansion .    in this article , we study the effective lagrangian of qcd at high density derived in  @xcite in detail , including the higher order corrections in @xmath0 expansion and the finite temperature effects .",
    "we then analyze the cooper - pair gap equation more rigorously and calculate the gap , the critical temperature , and the critical density . as applications ,",
    "we examine the effect of marginal four - quark operators on the neutrino - quark four - fermi coupling and the quark - axion coupling in super - dense quark matter .",
    "the idea of effective field theory is quite simple and its construction can be performed in a systematic way .",
    "first , one identifies or guesses the right degrees of freedom to describe the low energy processes .",
    "then , one integrates out the irrelevant degrees of freedom , which results in nonlocal interactions . by expanding the nonlocal interactions in powers of momentum at low energy ,",
    "one derives a ( wilsonian ) effective lagrangian , which is usually done in practice by matching all the one light - particle irreducible amplitudes in the full theory with those amplitudes in the effective theory in loop expansion .",
    "since the higher dimensional operators have smaller effects at low energy , the effective theories provide a very useful approach to describe low energy physics .",
    "a system of degenerate quarks with a fixed baryon number is described by the qcd lagrangian density with a chemical potential @xmath6 , @xmath7 where the covariant derivative @xmath8 and we neglect the mass of quarks for simplicity .",
    "the chemical potential is introduced as a lagrangian multiplier to constrain the system to have a fixed baryon number , @xmath9 . at zero temperature ,",
    "all the states up to the fermi surface are filled ; @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the volume , @xmath12 the number of quark flavors , and @xmath13 is the fermi momentum .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath6 , which defines the energy at the fermi surface , provides another scale for qcd .",
    "here we consider a super - dense quark matter where quarks are very dense so that the average inter - quark distance is much smaller than the characteristic length of qcd , @xmath14 . for high chemical potential , the pair creation of a particle and an anti - particle",
    "is suppressed at low energy because of the energy gap @xmath6 , provided by the fermi sea .",
    "therefore , the relevant degrees of freedom at low energy will be just particles and holes , excited near the fermi surface , together with gluons .",
    "we will derive a low energy effective lagrangian for cold and dense quark matter by integrating out the high frequency or irrelevant modes , _  la _ wilson , as we run qcd from high energy @xmath15 to low energy @xmath16 .",
    "since qcd is asymptotically free , quarks will interact weakly at energy @xmath17 and their spectrum will be approximately given by the free hamiltonian : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the energy eigenfunctions with eigenvalues @xmath21 , satisfying @xmath22 , respectively . at low energy @xmath23 , the states @xmath24 near the fermi surface , @xmath25 , are easily excited , while @xmath26 , which correspond to the states in the dirac sea , are completely decoupled due to the presence of the energy gap @xmath6 provided by the fermi sea .",
    "therefore the right degrees of freedom below @xmath6 consist of gluons and @xmath24 only .",
    "if @xmath27 , integrating out the high frequency modes in qcd just renormalizes the coupling constants without generating any new interactions as it should be for a renormalizable theory like qcd . however , when @xmath28 , the energy spectra of particles and anti - particles are asymmetric .",
    "anti - particles ( @xmath29 ) , which correspond to the absence of states ( @xmath26 ) in the dirac sea , have energy larger than @xmath6 and will be decoupled at energy scale lower than @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the minial quark - gluon coupling that connects @xmath26 with @xmath30 ( or vice versa ) , has to be removed at low energy , generating a new interaction among @xmath24 .",
    "we will see later that integrating out the modes whose frequency is higher than @xmath6 results in an effective lagrangian which is drastically different from qcd .",
    "we now integrate out the antiparticles ( @xmath29 ) or the states ( @xmath26 ) in the dirac sea to derive the low energy effective lagrangian .",

    "the magnitude of fermi velocity , @xmath35 , will be taken to be unity , for we assume the quark mass @xmath36 .",
    "since we will integrate out the high frequency modes such that we will be left with excitations only near the fermi surface at low energy , it is convenient to decompose the quark field by the fermi velocity   and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a residual momentum perpendicular to the fermi velocity .",

    "note also that , if @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the projection operator that projects out particles and holes ( @xmath24 ) , while @xmath59 projects out the states in the dirac sea ( @xmath26 ) . since the excitation of quarks along the perpendicular direction to the quark velocity does not cost any energy in the leading order , the perpendicular momentum is nothing but an index that labels the degeneracy in quark just as the degeneracy in the landau level under external constant magnetic field is labeled by the electron momentum perpendicular to the external magnetic field .    at tree - level , integrating out the irrelevant modes @xmath60 is tantamount to eliminating @xmath45 by the equations of motion , given as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 . plugging eq .",
