    "in field theory , supersymmetry ( susy ) is a model that relates fermions to bosons in order to obtain a unified description of all basic interactions of nature .",
    "while susy finds severe physical and mathematical obstacles as a realistic field theoretical model , susy quantum mechanics , i.e. the application of the susy superalgebra to quantum mechanics as opposed to quantum field theory , has offered deeper insights into various aspects of standard non - relativistic quantum mechanics , creating new areas of research in quantum mechanics itself @xcite . for example , susy clarifies why certain one - dimensional potentials are analytically solvable and others are not , helps in finding new solvable potentials , exemplifies the factorisation ( darboux ) method , and generates potentials with similar scattering properties .",
    "owing to the formal analogy between the helmholtz equation of monochromatic light waves in dielectric media and the stationary non - relativistic schrdinger equation , the methods of susy have been recently transferred into the optical context @xcite to synthesize dielectric optical media with tailored scattering and localization properties of potential interest to a wide variety of applications .",
    "susy optical structures can be used to realize global phase matching , efficient mode conversion , spatial multiplexing @xcite , as well as to design transparent defects , interfaces and optical intersections @xcite .",
    "susy can be applied to discretized light in waveguide lattices as well @xcite .",
    "periodic optical media , such as distributed feedback ( dfb ) structures in fibers or waveguides , provide an important class of optical devices .",
    "while susy can be applied in principle to periodic potentials ( see , for instance @xcite ) , analytical results in this case are extremely difficult because of the lack of exact analytical forms for the energy dispersion curves and bloch functions .",
    "moreover , application of susy to locally - periodic potentials , in which the local period and potential depth undergo slow changes , is extremely challenging . for locally - periodic shallow gratings ,",
    "light dynamics can be described with an excellent accuracy by couple - mode theory ( cmt ) , where the slow changes of the grating period and/or grating depth are simply included in a complex scattering potential @xcite . in cmt , coupling of the two counter - propagating waves in the medium",
    "is described by a set of coupled - mode equations ( cme ) , which can be cast in a form analogous to the dirac equation of a fermionic particle subjected to an external scalar and/or vectorial potential ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we highlight the susy structure of cme in dfb structures , and show that it can be suitably exploited to synthesize bragg grating filters with a given number of resonances at desired frequencies .",
    "this task is accomplished by application of multiple susy ( darboux - crum ) transformations @xcite , which lead to transparent potentials of kay - moses type @xcite as a special case .",
    "interestingly , the grating profile is simply determined by the superpotential of the underlying model . as an example",
    ", we apply our method to the synthesis of a dfb filter that supports discrete combs of transmission resonances .",
    "application of susy to bragg gratings thus provides an interesting _ analytical _",
    "tool for the synthesis of dfb filters , which is complementary to other analytical synthesis methods based e.g. on the gelfand - levitan - marchenko inverse scattering @xcite .",
    "light propagation in nonuniform grating structures , such as those realized in optical fibers or waveguides , is a well - known problem in the optics of periodic media . for sufficiently shallow gratings that result only in small reflections within a distance of one wavelength",
    ", cmt is an excellent approximation to the exact problem @xcite . in an effective one - dimensional model and for first - order bragg scattering",

    "note also that the cmt reproduces with excellent accuracy the results obtained by exact transfer matrix methods for shallow up to moderate gratings ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , which is the case of corrugated dfb waveguide filters or fiber gratings . to study bragg scattering of counterpropagating waves at frequencies close to @xmath10 ,",
