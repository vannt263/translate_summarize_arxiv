    "it is now well understood that the neutron is heavier than the proton because the down quark is heavier than the up quark , which more than compensates the positive electromagnetic charge energy of the proton .",
    "an earlier , alternative interpretation of the idea is due to coleman and glashow@xcite who express this as an electromagnetic hamiltonian operator , @xmath1 which contains an intrinsic ` tadpole ' term transforming as the third component of isospin ( @xmath2 in an su(3 ) context ) ; the @xmath3 piece corresponds to the first order in @xmath4 contribution due to photon exchange , which can be estimated in various ways and is predominantly positive . by using the group theoretical properties of @xmath5 one",
    "can thereby correlate many mass differences and magnetic moments of hadrons within a multiplet .",
    "in this paper we shall try to ascribe the tadpole term to the @xmath0 constituent quark mass difference and therefore obtain a more dynamical picture of its origin .",
    "this will involve us in evaluating _",
    "differences _ of certain ` bubble graphs ' plus vacuum ` tadpole ' diagrams for hadron self - energies , in addition to virtual photon emission / absorption graphs .",
    "apart from the vacuum diagrams , these bubble graph differences contain logarithmic infinities , requiring regularization .",
    "( the results are actually insensitive to the regularization and do not depend on momentum routing . ) in any case , as needed , we will at various points make use of simple quark chiral symmetry ideas@xcite , such as the goldberger - treiman relation ( for @xmath6 mev and @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 that correspond to ` gap equations ' in a dynamical context , in order to handle logarithmic infinities which sometimes arise .",
    "( the magnitude ( 2 ) also arises in the context of magnetic moments@xcite . )",
    "we will see that this quark interpretation of the coleman - glashow tadpole works quite well and provides a more fundamental description of electromagnetic properties of hadrons .",
    "however , before starting , it is as well to remind ourselves about the sort of magnitudes that we are chasing .",
    "the @xmath9 mass difference of about -1.3 mev gives a first indication : since virtual photon exchange provides the positive terms @xmath10 we may deduce@xcite @xmath11 the naive conclusion is therefore that @xmath12 mev .",
    "in the same vein , the observed @xmath13 mass splitting of 8 mev suggests that @xmath14 since the @xmath3 contribution , due alone to magnetic moments , is small ; it also accords with the su(3 ) symmetry prediction@xcite , @xmath15 .",
    "finally , we may extract a crude value for @xmath16 from the observed @xmath17 mass difference , since both @xmath18 and @xmath19 have the same quark structure ; thus @xmath20    we will review expectations for the @xmath0 mass difference in the next section . then in section iii we shall study pseudoscalar meson electromagnetic mass splittings from the perspective of qed and quark loop diagrams .",
    "a similar approach is applied to vector mesons in section iv , with particular emphasis on @xmath21 mixing .",
    "we will find that all cases , associated with logarithmic divergences , are governed by a universal ( tadpole ) scale of about -5200 mev@xmath22 , which is determined by a @xmath23 mass difference of about 4 mev .",
    "there we also offer some comparisons with other group - theoretical approaches .",
    "the nonstrange and strange constituent quark masses are very roughly given by @xmath24 mev , @xmath25 mev , respectively .",
    "similar results follow by examining the baryon masses but more accurate scales are found from the goldberger - treiman relation ( 2 ) and its analogue , @xmath26 .",
    "since experiments@xcite give @xmath27 , one deduces that @xmath28 , leading to the mass scales ( within a few mev ) , @xmath29 mev .    to obtain the still smaller @xmath0 mass difference",
    ", it is necessary to look at em mass differences between baryons , as indicated above , which suggest that @xmath30 mev .",
    "a similar inference can be drawn from the pseudoscalar mass differences : firstly we note that @xmath31 does not contribute to the @xmath32 mass difference ; secondly we take it that the @xmath3 term gives a comparable magnitude both to @xmath32 and @xmath33 squared masses .",
    "it follows that the tadpole contribution to @xmath34 is determined by@xcite @xmath35 mev@xmath22 . because we are ascribing this part to the underlying quarks",
    ", we may roughly equate it to ( as we shall confirm in different guise in the next section ) @xmath36 , whereupon one deduces @xmath30 mev .",
    "dashen s electromagnetic ( em ) pcac theorems@xcite are in conformity with this result .",
    "another source of information is the amazingly accurate hyperfine splitting quark model@xcite which predicts the constituent mass difference @xmath37 mev , but in conjunction with a ( baryon ) quark mass scale of @xmath38 mev .",
    "since this is rather greater than the previous scale by a factor of about 10% , one is inclined to reduce the isgur value of @xmath39 to 5.5 mev or less .",
    "the particle data tables@xcite provide yet another source , but for the current quark mass difference ; they say that @xmath40 hovers around 5 mev with an error of about 2 mev . a more global approach due to",
    "lichtenberg@xcite finds that the constituent @xmath23 quark mass difference exceeds 4.1 mev .",
    "given all these clues , we expect that constituent @xmath41 will be fairly close to the truth .",
    "let us use the magnitude of @xmath5 to come to some conclusions about the magnitude of the @xmath3 piece for various baryons and thereby estimate the strong interaction cutoff scale .",
    "the group - theoretical factors ensuing from the coleman - glashow operator @xmath42 and the overall scale , estimated in ref . [ 10 ] , provide the figures @xmath43 concentrating on the proton , we deduce that @xmath44 mev in order to give the observed @xmath45 mass difference . thus , neglecting magnetic moment contributions to the fermion self - energy ( which never exceed about 0.3 mev ) and using the standard qed result , @xmath46 \\simeq 1.2 { \\rm~mev},\\ ] ] we require a strong interaction cut - off @xmath47 gev .",
    "this is a reasonable magnitude since it comes from vector - meson dominated intermediate states and we will be adopting similar values subsequently to estimate the photon exchange contributions to meson masses .",
    "but in any case the picture looks rather good for baryons when one also includes@xcite the smaller magnetic contributions , as one can see from table 1 .",
    "we ascribe the su(2 ) differences to photon exchange and the @xmath23 quark mass disparity in intermediate loops in order to see if we can arrive at the same sort of estimate as the group - theoretical tadpole method . turning first to the pions",

    "symmetry says that @xmath67 mev ; probably the true value lies somewhere in between , say @xmath68 mev with a possible error of 200 mev .",
    "substituting this in ( 13 ) , we are led to the value @xmath69 mev , which is quite reasonable .",
    "the same idea can be used to estimate the non - strange electromagnetic transition amplitude , @xmath70 . in this case",
    "we do not have to worry about photon exchange and the surviving one - loop diagrams are given in figure 3 .",
    "here one finds @xmath71 -       \\frac{8igg_{a_0\\pi\\eta_{ns}}}{m_{a_0}^2}\\int \\bar{d}^4p       \\left[\\frac{m_u}{p^2-m_u^2 } - \\frac{m_d}{p^2-m_d^2}\\right].\\ ] ] we are on much firmer ground now if we claim that @xmath72 mev , since this just relies on u(2 ) symmetry . using the gap equation , and @xmath73 , we arrive at the clean result , @xmath74 , and thereby can predict the characteristic value @xmath75 ( mev)@xmath22 , for @xmath76 mev .",
    "next we turn to the vector mesons and the all - important coupling between the @xmath77 and the @xmath78 .",
    "the calculations are even simpler in this case .",
    "firstly we have the photon exchange term , which comes out cleanly near the vector mass shell @xmath79 as @xmath80 since the leptonic rates give @xmath81 and @xmath82 via vector meson dominance",

    "one obtains @xmath89 ^ 3}\\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\frac{n_c(m_d^2-m_u^2)}{2\\pi^2k^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , via the inverse propagator @xmath90 terms , one sees that @xmath91 has the significance of a squared mass . to this bubble contribution",
    "must be added the @xmath50 tadpole contribution ( see figure 4 for the sum of all graphs ) , which equals @xmath92.\\ ] ] let us invoke su(4 ) spin - flavour symmetry and set @xmath93 in order to progress the evaluation ; in this manner we estimate the @xmath50 tadpole contribution to equal that of the @xmath94 transition , namely @xmath95 . altogether , one deduces @xmath96 the rhs can be estimated by using the experimental value @xmath97 @xcite",
    "; one finds that both terms in ( 18 ) contribute almost equally , the result being @xmath98 mev@xmath22 , for @xmath99 mev . adding it to the photon exchange contribution",
    ", we end up with @xmath100 this agrees reasonably well with the magnitude @xmath101 mev@xmath22 , derived experimentally from the @xmath102 rate@xcite .    we can extend these ideas to other mixings like @xmath103 , @xmath104 , but such calculations are sensitive to the amount of admixture of nonstrange mesons in the heavy meson states",
    "indeed the experimental rates for @xmath105 and @xmath106 to two pions and two kaons directly measure the admixtures  and they are very small .",
    "thus we unable to test properly our quark loop hypothesis in those cases .",
    "the calculations above confirm that one can view the coleman - glashow tadpole piece as equivalent to a @xmath23 mass difference of about 4 mev in the context of a quark model . in this way",
    "we achieve a more fundamental picture of the electromagnetic properties of hadrons , when we combine the quark mass difference effect with standard photon emission / absorption .",
    "to conclude this paper , we compare @xmath107 mixing with other methods of estimation .",
    "firstly there is the method based on the coleman - glashow tadpole@xcite : @xmath108 for @xmath109 mev , this gives @xmath110 mev@xmath22 .",
    "secondly , one may use su(3 ) symmetry to connect this matrix element with the @xmath111 masses : @xmath112 thirdly , one can apply fully fledged su(6 ) symmetry to equate ( 21 ) with @xmath113 in no case is there any striking discrepancy",
    ". it might be possible also to generalize the argument to heavier mesons like @xmath114 and @xmath115 ; this would require strong faith in mass extrapolations and we have not been brave enough to try that . in this connection",
    "it is worth recalling the result of weinberg and lane@xcite , based on phenomenological chiral lagrangians , which yield @xmath116 mev and which predicts @xmath117 mev .    as a parting note ,",
    "observe that whether we use the coleman - glashow tadpole or regard it as the effect of an em quark loop , one is always making contact with data in the ( low - energy ) s - channel .",
    "alternatively , harari@xcite invoked crossing and duality to convert the view into the ( high - energy ) t - channel . by studying superconvergent relations",
    ", he identified the @xmath118 tadpole with a subtraction constant in the t - channel , associated with the @xmath119trajectory , and thereby justified the coleman - glashow procedure .",
    "it is a surprising fact that meson interactions are well determined by quark loops at zero external momentum ; for the lighter mesons like @xmath122 , this is no great deal as the extrapolation from the mass shell to zero momentum is small .",
    "the amazing thing is that trlinear meson couplings for the heavier quark @xmath123 composites are also well predicted in this way .",
