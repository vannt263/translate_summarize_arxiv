    "equilibration can be defined as the evolution of a system out of equilibrium towards a stationary state in the long - time limit . for quantum systems ,",

    "especially the question of thermalization is left open .    in this paper",
    "we study equilibration and thermalization of dissipative quantum harmonic oscillators , using the standard model of a central oscillator coupled to a harmonic oscillator bath . for this example we can determine the stationary state @xmath11 explicitly and analyze its dependence on the initial conditions completely .",
    "crucially , we allow for arbitrary non - thermal bath preparations in our study .",
    "thermalization is subject to additional conditions in this more general situation , and we show how the temperature of the asymptotic stationary state is obtained from the initial energy distribution of the oscillator bath rather than from the initial bath temperature .",
    "we also include the case study of an interaction quench in an infinite harmonic chain , where undamped oscillations can prevent equilibration at strong damping .",
    "the dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator is studied extensively in the literature  @xcite , covering such diverse topics as brownian motion  @xcite , quantum fluctuations  @xcite , driven dissipative systems  @xcite , entanglement  @xcite , the existence of local temperatures  @xcite , or the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
