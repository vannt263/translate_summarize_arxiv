    "[ sec : intro ]    the formation and nature of the first generation of so - called population iii ( pop iii ) stars have been studied and speculated about for over thirty years ( schwarzschild & spitzer 1953 ; yoneyama 1972 ; hartquist & cameron 1977 ; palla , salpeter & stahler 1983 ; silk 1983 ; and many others ) , but the extent to which they differed from present day stars in ways other than composition is still debated . recently , three - dimensional cosmological simulations have reached sufficient resolution on small scales to begin to address the star formation problem ( ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; abel et al .  1998 ) .",
    "while considerable uncertainty remains regarding the continued evolution of the dense knots they find in their calculations , these simulations do not exclude the formation of a first generation of quite massive stars @xmath6 ( _ e.g. _ , larson 1999 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2000 ) . using different numerical methods to analyze the fragmentation of primordial clouds , bromm et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reached similar conclusions . without further study , especially including the complexity of radiation transport and molecular opacities , it may be premature to conclude that _ all _ pop iii stars were so massive , but there certainly exists adequate motivation to examine the properties of such stars .",
    "in particular , if such massive pop iii stars were ever born , would they retain their large masses until death ?",
    "that is , would they die as pair - instability supernovae , with possible unique signatures of nucleosynthesis and black hole formation , or would they lose most of their mass and die much the same as present day stars ?",
    "it is well known ( ledoux 1941 ; schwarzschild & hrm 1959 ) that , above a critical mass , main sequence stars are vibrationally unstable due to the destabilizing effect of nuclear reactions in their central regions . for stars of pop",
    "i composition , the critical mass for this instability is @xmath7 ( schwarzschild & hrm 1959 ) .",
    "according to non - linear calculations , such an instability leads to mass loss rather than catastrophic disruption ( appenzeller 1970a ; talbot 1971ab ; papaloizou 1973ab ) .",
    "consequently , it has been thought that stars more massive than about 100 @xmath8would not survive for long before losing a substantial fraction of their mass .",
    "although the stability of very massive stars has well been explored since the work of ledoux ( 1941 ) , somewhat surprisingly , all these analyses have been devoted to solar - like compositions or slightly metal - poor stars ( schwarzschild & hrm 1959 ; stothers & simon 1968 ; aizenman et al .",
    "1975 ; stothers 1992 ; glatzel & kiriakidis 1993 ; kiriakidis et al .  1993 ) , or to helium - core objects such as wolf - rayet stars ( maeder 1985 ; cox & cahn 1988 ) . since the temperature dependence of hydrogen burning and the surface gravitational potential of low metal stars are quite different , it is important to learn whether their stability criteria may also vary .",
    "we have thus performed , to our knowledge , the first stability analysis of zero metallicity stars with @xmath9 and have also studied the stability of stars in this mass range for variable initial metal mass fraction @xmath10 .",

    "[ sec : model ]    the evolution of four stars of 120 , 200 , 300 and 500@xmath8was followed from the zero age main sequence ( zams ) to the end of core helium burning using an implicit lagrangian hydrodynamics code adapted to stellar modeling ( langer et al .  1988 , heger 1998 ; heger et al .",
    "details of the code can be found elsewhere ( heger & langer 2000 ) , but to summarize the main physics , the opacity is taken from iglesias and rogers ( 1996 ) and the principal nuclear reaction rates from caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) with the rate for @xmath11c(@xmath12o multiplied by a constant 1.7 ( see also buchmann 1996 ) .",
    "mass loss is not taken into account , except for what is driven by the pulsations studied here . for zero metallicity stars ,",
    "radiative mass loss is probably negligible ( kudritzki 2000 ) .    as was first noted by ezer and cameron ( 1971 ) , massive stars with no metals",
    "do not obtain their energy on the main sequence from the pp - cycle as one might naively expect .",
    "instead the star contracts to @xmath13 , burns a trace of helium to carbon , and then expands slightly to burn hydrogen by the cno cycle .",
    "a cno mass fraction of just a few times @xmath14 is sufficient to catalyze even the enormous energy generation of such stars .",
    "however , owing to this small cno mass fraction , the star retains a central temperature of @xmath15 throughout central hydrogen burning . as ezer & cameron ( 1971 ) also noted , these stars are thus much more compact than their metal - enriched counterparts and their radiation , while on the main sequence , is in the ultraviolet ( table  [ tab : zams ] ) .",

    "note however that , for @xmath17 , even metal - free stars evolve toward @xmath18 and eventually become red supergiants , as the hydrogen - burning shell becomes more active with increasing stellar mass .    in order to analyze the pulsational stability as a function of metallicity",

    "the main uncertainty in these calculations is the treatment of convection , which is treated in the `` frozen - in '' approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ , the perturbation , @xmath25 , of the convective flux is neglected in the linearized energy equation .",
    "although this approximation is an unavoidable consequence of our poor knowledge of the interaction between convection and pulsation , it should not be crucial .",
    "as we shall see , the relevant regions for pulsation , which are located in the deep interior of the stars , are fully convective and can be considered as adiabatic . in the outer regions , which may also be important for the pulsation ,",
    "the convective flux is not the dominant energy transport .",
    "the stability of the fundamental mode and the overtones ( up to the fifth overtone ) was analyzed starting from zams models up to the end of core helium burning for @xmath26 stars .",

    "for all masses studied , the zams models are unstable and oscillate in the fundamental mode , whereas the overtones are stable .",
    "the excitation mechanism is related to the temperature and density dependence of the nuclear energy generation rate near the center of the star , the so - called @xmath2-mechanism .",
    "as was shown by ledoux ( 1941 ) , this driving mechanism is efficient because of the large radiation pressure in such massive stars .",
    "the driving and damping zones are indicated by correspondingly positive and negative values of d@xmath36/d@xmath37 , where @xmath36 is the work integral ( cox 1980 ; unno et al .",

    "[ fig : dwdm ] _ _ for the 300@xmath8star .",
    "note that the outer damping regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dwdm]_a _ ) give a negligible contribution to the work integral due to the very small amount of mass involved ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dwdm]_b _ ) . the same behavior of the work integral is also found for the other masses studied .",
    "[ sec : evol ]    it is known from previous studies of solar metallicity stars that high mass stars eventually stabilize as they evolve away from the zams ( schwarzschild & hrm 1959 ; stothers and simon 1968 ; aizenman et al .  1975 ; maeder 1985 ) .",
    "stabilization comes about because of the increase of the mean molecular weight in the inner regions which increases the central condensation ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , maeder 1985 for details ) .",
    "the same properties are also found here for metal - free stars . as they evolve away from the zams , their @xmath5-folding time increases , indicating a decrease of the driving term due to nuclear energy compared to the damping term from heat leakage in the envelope .",

    "4 , the larger value of @xmath34 at early times and its rapid variation with time are due to the adjustment of the stellar structure when the initial cno is produced ( see  2 ) .",
    "the results are also summarized for the different models in table 2 which gives the number of @xmath5-foldings , @xmath38 , by which the amplitude of an initial perturbation would grow in the framework of linear stability analysis , as derived from integration of the stability coefficient with time ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] _ _ ) .    after reaching pulsational stability during central hydrogen burning ,",
    "all stars studied remained stable for the rest of central hydrogen burning and most of central helium burning as well .",
    "stars of @xmath39 remained stable throughout core helium burning , but stars of initial mass @xmath40 became unstable again towards the end of helium burning .",
    "this resurgence of instability happens for a central helium mass fraction @xmath41 in the 300@xmath8star and @xmath42 for the 500@xmath8star , corresponding to 30 and 50@xmath43before the end of central helium burning , respectively .",
    "the unstable mode is the fundamental mode , characterized by @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the 300@xmath8star and @xmath46 and @xmath47 for 500@xmath8star .",
    "the pulsations in these blue supergiants , with @xmath48 k , exist only in a surface layer that contains very little mass .",
    "the 500@xmath8star , however , expands further and becomes a red supergiant with an extended convective envelope that is characterized by increasing period and decreasing @xmath5-folding time .",
    "the instabilities during core helium burning are characterized by small values of @xmath31compared to the pulsation period .",
    "this indicates the presence of a strong instability that can develop rapidly and reach large amplitudes .",
    "inspection of the work integral shows that the driving zone is located in the hydrogen / helium ionization zone and the excitation mechanism is the standard @xmath3-mechanism .",
    "note also that the helium cores would quickly become unstable to the @xmath2-instability , just like their higher metallicity counterparts , if the hydrogen envelope were removed , _",
    "e.g. _ , to a binary companion .",
    "[ sec : z ]    table  [ tab : zams ] gives the pulsational properties of zams models as a function of @xmath0 .",

    "the fundamental mode is the pulsation mode and the overtones are stable . only for 120@xmath8with @xmath49 ,",
    "are both the fundamental ( f ) and the first overtone ( 1h ) unstable , with an @xmath5-folding time for 1h much shorter than for the f mode .",
    "table  [ tab : zams ] also gives the results for solar metallicity models calculated with pure electron scattering opacity .",
    "for such models , our results are in good agreement with previous results based on pure electron scattering or on simple opacity laws .",

    "inspection of table  [ tab : zams ] shows that for a given mass , the period decreases with metallicity .",
    "this is a consequence of the smaller radius and more compact structure of metal - poor stars when they reach thermal equilibrium on the zams , a well known effect of @xmath0 on evolutionary models ( _ e.g. _ , ezer & cameron 1971 ; baraffe & el eid 1991 ; meynet et al 1994 ) .",
    "the period , @xmath30 , is related to the dynamical time scale of the star , @xmath56 .",
    "another important result of table  [ tab : zams ] is the increase of @xmath31as @xmath0 decreases from @xmath20 to 0 .",
    "this indicates that metal - free stars , although unstable , require a much longer time for the growth of the oscillation amplitudes than solar metallicity stars .",
    "we also note a significant difference between @xmath31obtained for @xmath57 models calculated using the most recent opacities , and the electron scattering cases .",
    "this highlights an important contribution of opacity to the instability of very massive stars with solar metallicity .",
    "indeed , the driving zones in the @xmath20 zams models with @xmath58 are located at @xmath59 and are associated with a sharp peak of the opacity in this region due to the contribution of heavy elements ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) . for 120@xmath8with @xmath60 , our results are in agreement with the analysis of glatzel & kiriakidis ( 1993 ) : the driving for the first overtone is due to the @xmath3-mechanism whereas for the fundamental mode , both the @xmath2- and the @xmath3- mechanisms contribute to the driving .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases , we find a transition between nuclear - driven pulsation and opacity - driven pulsation ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath2- and @xmath3-mechanisms ) .",
    "the @xmath2-mechanism is dominant for @xmath61 and the @xmath3-mechanism dominates for @xmath62 , for the mass range of interest .",
    "the increase of @xmath31as @xmath0 decreases for @xmath63 is partly due to the different temperature dependence of the nuclear energy generation from the cno cycle .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : zams ] , central hydrogen burning proceeds at higher @xmath64 for decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "locally , the temperature dependence of the specific nuclear energy generation rate , @xmath65 , depends on temperature as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .",
    "since the temperature sensitivity , @xmath68 , of hydrogen burning by the cno - cycle decreases with increasing temperature ( _ e.g. _ , kippenhahn & weigert , 1992 , figure  18.8 ) the metal - rich stars have a stronger sensitivity than the metal poor stars .",
    "we find @xmath69 for @xmath26 and @xmath68 increases with @xmath0 up to @xmath70 for @xmath57 in the 120@xmath8star .",
    "analytically @xmath68 can be computed from @xmath71 where @xmath72 @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 are mass number and charge number of the two input nuclei , and @xmath77 is the temperature in 9@xmath78(clayton 1968 ) . for @xmath79(p,@xmath80 ) , @xmath81 at @xmath82 and @xmath83 at @xmath84 , in agreement with the values obtained above .",
    "since the driving of pulsations due to the @xmath2-mechanism depends directly on @xmath68 with @xmath85 , it is larger in metal - rich than in metal - free stars , contributing to the decrease of @xmath86 = @xmath87 as @xmath0 increases .",
    "another contribution to @xmath86 comes from the total pulsation energy @xmath88",

    "( [ eq : lpuls ] ) and ( [ eq : ep ] ) ) and @xmath30 increases with @xmath0 , as mentioned above .",
    "as long as the contribution of metals to the opacity is negligible , this explains why @xmath92 decreases as @xmath0 increases .",

    "still heavier stars make black holes ( bond , arnett & carr 1984 ) . extrapolating from our results , we speculate that stars of @xmath137 might experience such strong mass loss that they end their lives as smaller objects . but clearly the stability of these massive `` first stars '' is a subject worthy of additional exploration beyond the first linear stability analysis presented here .",

    "<S> since they stabilize quickly after evolving off the zams , the pulsation may not have sufficient time to drive appreciable mass loss in z = 0 stars . for reasonable assumptions regarding the efficiency of converting pulsational energy into mass loss </S>",
