    "an important finding is that the long - time dynamics does not depend on the microscopic dynamics ; the same long - time dynamics has been observed in simulations using newtonian @xcite , stochastic @xcite , brownian @xcite and monte carlo @xcite dynamics .",
    "this result can be rationalized within the mode - coupling approach @xcite .",

    "[ bond]a , but the ratio @xmath16 is not as large for brownian dynamics than for newtonian dynamics .",

    "[ dh1]a . however , we find that the relationship between the strength of the dynamic heterogeneity and the dynamic correlation length in 2d is the same for brownian and newtonian dynamics , see fig .",
    "the latter two results show that the universality of the relationships between the relaxation time and properties of heterogeneous dynamics that we found in 3d @xcite is absent in 2d .",
    "furthermore , a full description of heterogeneous dynamics in 2d must also include the influence of the microscopic dynamics , and descriptions solely in terms of the structure or the potential energy landscape are not sufficient in 2d .",
    "glassy dynamics in 2d and in 3d are profoundly different . while we only presented detailed results for one glass - former , we verified that the features of the translational relaxation and dynamic heterogeneity are qualitatively the same for three additional 2d glass - formers ( see methods for their description and supplemental information for the results ) .",
    "our results call for a re - examination of the present glass transition paradigm in 2d .",
    "we note that there is currently no theoretical framework that accounts for the different dynamics observed in the 2d glass forming systems .",
    "however , we note that the dynamic picture of the random first order transition theory breaks down for dimensions less than two , and has been described as marginal for two dimensions @xcite .",
    "moreover , insights gained from theoretical analysis of the 2d glassy dynamics and glass transition might shed light onto slow dynamics and the glass transition in 3d",
