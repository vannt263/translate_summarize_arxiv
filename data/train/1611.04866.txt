    "occurrence of strongly lensed supernovae ( sne ) has long been predicted @xcite , but they had not been discovered until very recently . @xcite reported the discovery of a strongly lensed type ia supernova ( sn ia ) ps1 - 10afx with a total magnification of @xmath0 , although multiple images were not resolved .",
    "first resolved multiple images of a lensed sn were reported by @xcite : sn refsdal , a core - collapse sn , that is strongly lensed into multiple images by a foreground galaxy cluster .",
    "although many strongly lensed galaxies and quasars have already been discovered , strongly lensed sne have notable advantages over traditional strong lenses , particularly if they are of type ia .",
    "this is because of the standard candle nature of sne ia , which allows us to measure the magnification factor directly .",
    "while measurements of the hubble constant from time delays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) need to overcome various degeneracies including the mass - sheet degeneracy @xcite , the magnification factor provides important information on the lens potential , which directly breaks the mass - sheet degeneracy @xcite and the degeneracy in the lens potential and the hubble constant from time - delay measurements @xcite .",
    "indeed several lensed sne ia behind massive clusters , although not multiply imaged , have been used to constrain mass distributions of foreground clusters @xcite .    recently ,",
    "* hereafter , g16 ) reported the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed type ia supernova ( sn ia ) iptf16geu from intermediate palomar transient factory ( iptf ) . in this letter",
    ", we present time - delay predictions and interpret sn magnifications in light of microlensing .",
    "this letter is organised as follows .",
    "we introduce iptf16geu in section  [ sec : iptf_sn ] and describe our mass modelling method in section  [ sec : mod ] .",
    "we present predictions for magnifications and time delays and discuss the role of microlensing in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "we calculate the expected frequency of lensed sne ia in section  [ sec : n_sne ] and give our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the sn ia of iptf16geu has a redshift @xmath1 = 0.409 and is magnified by a factor of @xmath2 by an intervening galaxy at @xmath3 ( g16 ) .",
    "after spectroscopic confirmation , several follow - up programs were triggered to resolve the multiple images , measure light curves and time delays . among the ground - based follow - up ,",
    "data taken with osiris on keck with adaptive optics on oct 13 , 2016 yielded an image quality with fwhm=007 in @xmath4 band establishing the presence of multiple lensed images of the sn .",
    "however , only two brighter sn images were visible because light from the host galaxy dominated the emission at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "subsequent high - resolution images taken by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) in the optical clearly revealed four sn images ( dd 14862 , pi : goobar ) . in this letter , we use the _ hst _ image taken on oct 28 , 2016 , since it is deeper than images taken at previous epochs .",
    "we choose the f814w band which shows all sn images clearly ( labelled a - d in descending order of their fluxes , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mod ] ) .",
    "we model iptf16geu with two different mass modelling software : glafic @xcite and glee @xcite . this work is done independently by different coauthors , providing cross validation of our model results and predictions .",
    "our cosmology is set to @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding time - delay distance for the lens system is @xmath8mpc .",

    "additional data constraints come from the extended host galaxy which is lensed into almost an einstein ring .",
    "both the software model the light of foreground lens galaxy with a sersic profile @xcite , but differ in their assumptions about the mass profile of the lens and the model for the sn host galaxy .",
    "we fit the arbitrary sn fluxes simultaneously as we fit the sn positions and the lensed host ( sersic ) with lens mass model using glafic .",
    "the lens mass distribution is modelled as a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) .",
    "we imposed the following constraints on the lens parameters .",
    "the centroid , axis ratio ( @xmath10 ) and position angle ( pa , @xmath11 ) is assumed to be the same for the mass density and light profiles .",
    "external shear ( @xmath24 ) is often degenerate with the ellipticity of the mass distribution .",
    "hence , we did not include any external shear , and were able to find a good model fit ( see middle column in fig .",
    "[ fig : mod ] ) .",
    "we used a custom emcee @xcite wrapper around glafic to sample the posterior distribution of our models using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach .      with glee",
    ", we fit the sn images on the image plane simultaneously with its host galaxy surface brightness that is modeled on a grid of pixels on the source plane @xcite .",
    "we use a power - law mass distribution for the lensing galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with six parameters : centroid ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , einstein radius @xmath9 and radial mass profile slope @xmath12 corresponding to the three - dimensional mass density @xmath63 .",
    "we also test sie model for comparison with results of glafic .",
    "we further consider a lens model that includes an external shear component , with the shear magnitude ( @xmath24 ) and angle ( @xmath64 ) as two additional parameters .",
    "the lensed arcs of the sn host galaxy and the fitted sn image positions provide constraints on the lens mass parameters .",
    "the sn and lens mass / light parameters have uniform priors .",
    "we sample all the model parameters using either emcee or the mcmc method described in @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : mod ] , we show images of our most probable models ( top row - panels b and c ) and the corresponding residuals ( model subtracted from the data , normalized by the estimated pixel uncertainties , bottom row - panels e and f ) .",
    "the pixellated reconstruction of the sn host galaxy on the source plane from glee is also shown ( panel d ) with the location of sn ( star ) . parts of the host galaxy and the sn lie within the astroid caustic ( red curve ) and are thus quadruply imaged , whereas other parts are doubly imaged .",
    "we also present our modelling results from both glafic and glee in table  [ tab : mod ] and they agree reasonably well .",
    "the median of the posterior distributions and their 68% confidence levels for the lens parameters are given .",
    "the slope of the density profile is consistent with isothermal ( @xmath65 ) within the uncertainties .",
    "the power law models with and without @xmath24 are the same within the uncertainties suggesting that the role of @xmath24 is not significant .",
    "we also give predictions for magnifications and relative time delays for sn images ( a , b , c and d ) in table  [ tab : mod ] .",
    "negative magnifications imply opposite parity of the images and that they correspond to saddle points in the time - delay surface ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as expected , the predicted relative magnifications are comparable ( within a factor of 2 ) for all sn images .",
    "light from image b arrives first , followed by images d , a and c consistently for all our models . images a and c",
    "are saddle images ( negative parity ) and images b and d are minima ( positive parity ) .",
    "we find that the time delays ( relative to image b ) are within a day , a more stringent limit than the 100-hour range predicted by g16 .",
    "now , we use the standard candle nature of sn ia to our advantage in understanding expected and observed sn fluxes .",
    "we take the best - fit sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) i - band model light curve from g16 ( corresponding to f814w ) . after accounting for time dilation and dust extinction of e(b - v)=0.31 assuming rv=3.1",
    ", we calculate the un - lensed sn flux expected on oct 28 , 2016 ( 35 days from maximum ) to be 24.21 abmag . in fig .",
    "[ fig : snmag ] , we show the un - lensed sn flux scaled up by magnification factors from our models ( filled symbols ) . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the observed psf fluxes of the sn images ( open symbols , based on fits by the two modeling software ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that image d which appears the faintest in the data is predicted to have the largest magnification factor .",
    "image c is the least magnified of all and most consistent with expected magnification .",
    "both images a and b are expected to be fainter than d in the absence of any external factors affecting the fluxes but are found to be greatly magnified .    since the relative time delays are less than a day from our models , differences in the observed fluxes are unlikely to be due to time delays .",
    "while differential dust extinction could be a possible cause of anomalies in fluxes , it is unlikely to produce such large differences , given the almost symmetrical distribution of sn images around the lens which is an early - type galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ? * also , g16 suggest that extinction is not signficant ) .",
    "the most likely explanation for highly anomalous fluxes is microlensing due to stars in the foreground lens galaxy .",
    "saddle images such as image a are more susceptible to show microlensing ( de-)magnification in their fluxes whereas minimum images typically have enhanced fluxes over the macro - magnification ( i.e. magnification from a smooth mass model e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the apparent suppression of image d ( positive parity ) is puzzling .",
    "our independent mass models tested with independent software attest to the robustness of the image parity and magnification factors within their uncertainties .",
    "intriguingly , microlensing may affect the lightcurves fit by g16 in a manner which leads them to conclude a fainter intrinsic sn brightness than the true value , and hence requires a higher magnification @xcite .",
    "if the combined light from the sn images is magnified by less than 4.37 mag as suggested ( g16 ) , this could alleviate the discrepancy ( of over a magnitude ) between the expected and measured flux of image d ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : snmag ] ) .",
    "@xcite calculated the optical depths for microlensing of lensed sn ia and found a high probability for lensed sne to be affected by microlensing .",
    "assuming typical stellar mass fractions measured from the lens galaxies of the sloan acs survey ( slacs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , about 25% of lensed sn ia are expected to show magnitude differences of more than 1 magnitude . for a typical sn photosphere size ( @xmath66  cm ) and lens velocity dispersion ( @xmath67  km  s@xmath68 ) , we calculate caustic crossing time to be @xmath69  years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , sn photosphere velocities of @xmath70  km  s@xmath68 imply that microlensing effects could be visible on shorter time scales corresponding to the light curve .",
    "microlensing can affect sn ia light curves on different time scales and produce different qualitative signatures ( e.g. , large magnitude offsets , introduce non - intrinsic peaks , change the decay rate ) thus making it difficult to measure time delays with accuracy better than a few days @xcite .",
    "g16 used the snoc monte - carlo package @xcite to calculate the expected number of lensed sne ia with high magnification and found that it appears to be too low to explain the discovery of iptf16geu .",
    "based on this comparison , they argued that lensing by sub - kpc structures may have been greatly underestimated .",
    "here we present an independent comparison of the expected number and property of strongly lensed sn ia with iptf16geu .",
    "our estimate of the expected lensing rate is based on monte - carlo simulations presented in @xcite , in which realistic population of lensing galaxies and the source population has been considered , and various selection biases such as magnification bias and k - correction have been properly taken into account .",
    "mass distributions of lensing galaxies are assumed to follow the singular isothermal ellipsoid with an external shear . here",
    "the velocity function of galaxies of all types directly measured in sdss @xcite is used for the abundance of lensing galaxies .",
    "however , calculations of @xcite assumed that multiple images be resolved in surveys , which was not the case for iptf .",
    "the poor spatial resolution of iptf makes most of multiply imaged sne blended . in order to compute lensing rates in such a situation",
    ", we use the total magnification , rather than magnifications of individual images used in @xcite , to compute the magnification bias .",
    "we also impose no lower limit on the image separation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in order to compute the expected total number of lensed sne ia , we need to know the total survey volume of iptf . according to g16 , the total monitoring time and the average solid angle of iptf and ptf ( precursor survey to iptf ) translates into the total survey volume of @xmath71  deg@xmath72year , which we adopt in the following calculations .",
    "the detection limit is @xmath73 , but in order to observe light curves well we assume that peak magnitudes of sne be one magnitude brighter than the limiting magnitude in order to be detected and studied in iptf , i.e. , the limiting magnitude of the peak sn brightness of @xmath74 .",
    "we find that the expected number of lensed sne ia in iptf and ptf calculated using the setup above is @xmath75 , which would be consistent with the discovery of iptf16geu .",
    "the probability distribution for the expected redshifts , image separation , and magnifications are shown using orange histograms and compared to iptf16geu ( vertical dashed line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] .",
    "because of the large effect of the magnification bias , our calculation also predicts a high fraction of quadruple lenses , @xmath76% , which is consistent with iptf16geu being a quadruple lens .",
    "however , the efficiency of the spectroscopic typing of iptf events goes down at @xmath77 ( goobar , priv .",
    "the expected number of lensed sne ia with @xmath78 is @xmath79 ( see green histograms for distribution of properties ) , making it less likely to be discovered",
    ". the observed magnification of iptf16geu in this case also appears inconsistent given the distribution .",
    "this is in agreement with g16 , who require extreme assumptions about the fraction of compact objects in halos .",
    "this may be further evidence for the presence of microlensing .",
    "we have presented lens modelling results for the recently discovered gravitationally lensed sn ia , iptf16geu ( g16 ) .",
    "our mass modeling predicts flux ratios within a factor of 2 across the four lensed images of the sn .",
    "however , the brightest images a and b are nearly 15 and 5 times brighter , respectively , than the fainter pair of images ( c and d ) as measured from the hst f814w image .",
    "differential extinction may have very little to no contribution , as noted in g16 , especially at nir . and",
    ", yet the high contrast in flux ratios appears similar at other optical and nir wavelengths ( see g16 ) .",
    "our interpretation is that most of the sn images are affected by microlensing where flux of images a and b are highly magnified .",
    "image d ( positive parity ) is fainter than expected value .",
    "uncertainties in deriving the intrinsic sn flux from the light curves , likely affected by microlensing , could alleviate this discrepancy .",
    "we predict relative time delays of the order of less than a day , a consistent but more stringent upper limit than the hundred hours predicted in g16 .",
    "accurate measurements of the time delays will require observations with high cadence ( @xmath80 a few hours apart ) and preferably around characteristic features in the light curves .",
    "however , small time delays predicted in our mass modeling and probable microlensing effects suggest that accurate measurements of time delays may be quite challenging ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "lastly , based on our detailed calculations of lensing rates , the expected average number of lensed sn ia from ptf / iptf is @xmath75 .",
    "however the spectroscopic followup and typing efficiency implies a restriction of @xmath81 ( g16 and a.  goobar priv .",
    "comm . ) which reduces this expected number to @xmath79 .",
    "this also implies that the high observed magnification of iptf16geu is quite unlikely , and hints at a possible role of microlensing .",
