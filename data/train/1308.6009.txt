    "mic , instead , finds general associations in data structures , but may be impractical to deal with a large amount of parameters .      in order to better understand the pros and cons of using rpca , we first start the analysis with the standard pca . fig . [",
    "fig : pca_evol ] shows the contribution of the first three pcs to @xmath85 , as a function of redshift .",
    "three pcs account for more than @xmath86 per cent of @xmath85 at any redshift , while two pcs explain more than @xmath87 per cent except at @xmath88 , when the contribution drops to @xmath89 per cent .",
    "the sharp variation of the pcs around @xmath90 acts as a smoking gun for a global cosmological event .",
    "indeed , this is a direct consequence of first sf episodes and the interplay between chemical and mechanical feedback from the first stars , that takes place around @xmath91 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as molecules are produced over time , they lead to gas collapse , stellar formation and metal pollution , with consequent back reaction on the thermal behavior of the surrounding gas ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this redshift range represents an epoch of fast and turbulent growth of the metal filling factor , from @xmath92 at @xmath93 to @xmath94 at @xmath88 ( see fig . 1 from * ? ? ?",
    "at the beginning , only the gas at high densities is affected by metal enrichment , due to sf concentration in these regions . as sf and",
    "metal spreading proceed , the surrounding lower density environments are affected as well .",
    "sne heat high - density gas within star - forming sites and , consequently , hot low - density gas is ejected from star - forming regions by sn winds .",
    "the contribution of each pc dramatically changes if we use rpca instead .",
    "the clearest advantage is the amount of variance explained by each component ( hereafter , when necessary to avoid ambiguity , the pcs from rpca analysis will be referred as rpcs ) .",
    "rpc1 accounts for no less than @xmath95 per cent of the @xmath59 anytime , whilst two rpcs account for more than @xmath96 per cent",
    ". moreover , the rpc2 contribution mostly stands out between at @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "albeit contributing differently to the total variance , the general behavior of pc1 and pc2 is similar to the rpc1 and rpc2 , as well as the physical interpretation .",
    "but rpca assigns less weight to the baryonic properties , suggesting the halo mass as the most significant factor .",
    "this difference occurs because even a small fraction of large errors can cause arbitrary corruption in pca s estimate .",
    "for instance , pca is more sensitive to rapid variations of the halo chemical properties , having a steeper reaction in their first pcs .",
    "thus , as expected rpca surpass pca in their ultimate goal : reduce the system dimensionality .",
    "nevertheless , the greatest power to synthesize information carries the assumption that outliers are caused by corrupted data , which is not always the case .",
    "this potential drawback will be better understood looking at the contribution of each variables to the @xmath55-th pcs as discussed in the following .",
    "[ fig : pc_bar ] shows the relative contribution of each parameter to the first three pcs ( rpcs ) on the left ( right ) side . for the pca case , @xmath0 and @xmath1 dominate pc1 at @xmath99 ( no less than @xmath100 62 per cent ) , followed by a smaller contribution of sfr and @xmath33",
    "nevertheless , as gas collapses into potential wells , the relative contribution from @xmath1 increases , surpassing @xmath0 at @xmath101 .",
    "the dominant contribution of @xmath12 and @xmath33 to pc1 at @xmath102 indicates a critical epoch for the cosmic chemical enrichment ( see also discussion above ) , triggered by a rapid variation of @xmath33 , followed by a wide metal pollution at @xmath103 .",
    "after a decline in the chemical enrichment rate , a second peak in @xmath12 occurs at @xmath104 .",
    "this self - regulated , oscillatory behavior is caused by the simultaneous coexistence of cold pristine - gas inflows and hot metal enriched outflows that create hydro instabilities and turbulent patterns with reynolds numbers @xmath105 ( see e.g. fig . 2 from * ? ? ?",
    ". finally at @xmath30 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 have become almost subdominant , since pc1 is mainly led by @xmath32 and @xmath12 , as a result of the ongoing cosmic heating from sf and thermal feedback .",
    "the dominance by @xmath32 to pc1 at this redshift occurs due to the presence of some small ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : variables_evol ] ) , high - temperature objects , whose properties are contaminated by hot enriched material at @xmath106 k.    an inspection of pc2 reveals the _ supporting roles _ during the galaxy formation process .",
    "the pc1 peak in @xmath12 at redshift 13 is preceded by a strong contribution of _ sfr _ and halo masses to pc2 , while the second pc1 peak in @xmath12 , around @xmath107 , is anticipated by an increasing contribution to pc2 from the formed stars , which later explode as sne and start the metal enrichment of the universe .",
    "the first rise of pc2 at @xmath108 , dominated by sfr , occurs because the protogalaxies at this epoch are experiencing the first bursts of sf . nevertheless , not all of them have necessarily formed stars already . whilst the second peak is composed of a more balanced contribution from sfr and @xmath36 .",
    "the oscillatory behavior might be caused by the competitive effects of different feedback mechanisms : the gas undergoing sf is heated by sn explosions and it is inhibited to continuously form stars ( mostly in smaller structures that suffer significantly gas evaporation processes ) ; while shock compressions and spreading of metals in the medium enhance gas cooling capabilities and consequently induce more sf .",
    "the former preferentially occurs in bigger objects that can keep and re - process their metals because of the deeper potential wells .",
    "pc3 is nearly negligible in the whole redshift range aside @xmath109 , where @xmath110 dominates the general behavior .",
    "this epoch is preceded by a significant contribution from @xmath36 at @xmath111 . a comparison with fig .",
    "@xmath112 reveals that this behavior coincides with a growth in the @xmath33 variance at the same redshift .",
    "this indicates a transition in the regular trend of increasing @xmath33 with increasing mass at @xmath113 , when initial collapse phases boost @xmath33 up to @xmath114 .",
    "this rapid growth of @xmath33 preferentially occurs in galaxies of @xmath115 , that are forming their first stars and have not been previously affected by feedback mechanisms . at @xmath116 ,",
    "feedback effects from pop iii forming galaxies become responsible for increasing the variance of @xmath33 by several orders of magnitude , either by dissociating molecules , or by partially enhancing their formation by shocks and gas compression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "looking the rpca , the rpc1 is dominated by halo masses during all cosmic evolution ( no less than 68 per cent ) , with other baryonic properties relegated to rpcs of higher orders .",
    "some caution is needed to interpret these results",
    ". the higher level of compressibility presented by rpca is a direct consequence of attributing a smaller weight to rare events .",
    "therefore , if one intends to describe all haloes properties using the fewest parameters possible , rpca appears to succeed , since it states that as a first approximation , the total halo mass is the main factor to describe all other properties .",
    "the mass determines the potential well and consequently the ability of the halo to form stars , retain the metals , etc , therefore roughly dictating the baryonic dynamics at a first sight .",
    "since rpca ascribes a lower weight to the tails of each parameter distribution , the physical interpretation may become less evident for the highest rpcs .",
    "however , we can still see the importance of @xmath12 , @xmath33 and sfr , with the difference that now they are considered second order effects , hence starting to be dominant from the rpc2 forward . to better understand these differences between rpca and pca we discuss the strength with which each variable is related to one another as follows .",

    ", @xmath33 shows the highest level of correlation with @xmath1 , followed by @xmath32 , sfr , @xmath36 and @xmath12 respectively . in general , structure formation processes depend not only on the dark matter halo properties , but also on the local thermodynamical state of the gas , which is , in turn , affected by cooling , _ sf _ and feedback .",
