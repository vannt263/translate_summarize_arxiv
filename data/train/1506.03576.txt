    "geometrically frustrated magnets have attracted a long - standing and ongoing attention in the field of condensed matter physics because they often give rise to a variety of nontrivial thermodynamic states . in particular ,",
    "the quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) state having no magnetic long - range order ( lro ) has been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "anderson proposed the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state as a possbile ground state of the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice@xcite . according to many subsequent theoretical studies",
    ", however , it is now widely believed that the ground state of a simple @xmath0 antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model on the triangular lattice with the nearest - neighbor bilinear interaction exhibits a n@xmath9el lro with the three - sublattice @xmath10 structure@xcite .    by contrast",
    ", the ground state of the @xmath0 heisenberg model on the kagome lattice , which has stronger frustration than the triangular lattice , is quite likely to be non - magnetic .",
    "namely , the absence of the magnetic lro in the @xmath0 kagome af heisenberg model has now been established from various numerical studies@xcite , although the precise nature of its ground state still remains controversial .",
    "various candidates , including the gapped @xmath11 spin - liquid @xcite , the gapless u(1 ) spin liquid@xcite , the chiral spin liquid@xcite and the valence bond crystal@xcite @xmath12 , have been proposed .    along with these theoretical studies , experimental quest for the qsl",
    "has also been persued . as a result",
    ", several promising candidate materials were recently reported . in the triangular system ,",
    "certain organic salts such as @xmath1@xcite and @xmath2_2}$]@xcite were reported to exhibit a qsl - like behavior , _",
    "i.e. _ , exhibit no magnetic lro down to a very low temperature .",
    "these organic materials show gapless ( or nearly gapless ) behaviors at low temperatures .",
    "for example , the specific heat@xcite and the thermal conductivity@xcite exhibit the behavior linear in the absolute temperature @xmath13 . obviously , in understanding the qsl - like properties of these triangular organic salts , some extension beyond the simplest nearest - neighbor heisenberg model is needed@xcite .    in the kagome system ,",
    "herbertsmithite @xmath3 was reported to be a candidate of qsl , again showing gapless behaviors in various physical quantities@xcite .",
    "the true nature of these gapless qsl candidates experimentally observed both in the triangular and the kagome lattice afs has still remained obscure in spite of much theoretical and experimental efforts devoted to the issue .    for years",
    ", major part of theories have tried to elucidate the experimentally observed qsl behaviors as properties of a clean and regular system . by contrast",
    ", it was proposed recently in refs.@xcite and @xcite that the quenched bond - randomness , together with the geometrical frustration effect , might be essential in stabilizaing the experimentally observed gapless qsl state both in the triangular organic salts and in the kagome herbersmithite .",
    "such a randomness - induced qsl state is called the `` random - singlet state''@xcite or the `` valence bond glass state''@xcite , where the spin singlet is formed in a spatially random manner .",
    "possible importance of the quenched site - randomness in kagome herbertsmithite was also pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "the origin , or even the existence of the quenched randomness in triangualr organic salts and kagome herbersmithite is a non - trivial matter , especially in view of the fact that the theory requires a considerable amount of randomness , not an infinitesimal one , to realize the qsl - like behavior @xcite .    in the case of the triangular organic salts ,",
    "it was suggested that the randomness for the spin degrees of freedom was self - generated at low temperatures via the random freezing of the electric - polarization degrees of freedom inherent to these organic salts consisting of molecular dimers @xcite .",
    "in fact , the measured ac dielectric constant of these organic salts exhibited a glassy response even on a macroscopic time scale of khz in the temperature region where the qsl behavior was observed in the spin degree of freedom@xcite .    in the case of kagome herbertsmithite ,",
    "the quenched randomness comes from the random substitution of non - magnetic zn@xmath14 by magnetic cu@xmath14 , located on the triangular layer adjacent to the kagome layer @xcite .",
    "note that the kagome layers in herbertsmithite are separated by @xmath15^{4-}$ ] octahedral units whose zn@xmath14 constitutes the triangular layer .",
    "it was reported that about 15@xmath16 of zn@xmath14 on the triangular layer was randomly substituted by cu@xmath14 , keeping the kagome layer intact@xcite . since cu@xmath14 is a jahn - teller ion , such a random substituion would lead to a random jahn - teller distortion of the @xmath17^{4-}$ ] octahedra , leading to the random modification of the exchange path , and subsequently the exchange strength , connecting the cu@xmath14 on the kagome layer @xcite .    indeed , the numerical results on a simplified random @xmath0 af heisenberg model on the triangular and the kagome lattices appear to reproduce many of experimentally observed features@xcite of various thermodynamic quantities , including the @xmath13-lienar low - temperature specific heat@xcite , the gapless magnetic susceptibility occasionally accompanying a curie - like tail@xcite , and the gapless temperature dependence of the nmr relaxation rate 1/@xmath18 @xcite .    in view of this apparent success of the random model in reproducing the experimentally observed qsl - like behaviors",
    ", it would be desirable to further investigate the nature of the static and the dynamical spin correlations of the randomness - induced qsl state , the random singlet state .",
    "for this purpose , in the present paper we compute by means of an exact diagonalization technique the static and the dynamical spin structure factors which are experimentally accessible via , _",
    "e.g. _ , the elastic and the inelastic neutron scattering measurements .",
    "such a comparison between theory and experiment might give further information in examining the validity of the randomness - induced qsl picture of the experimentally observed qsl states . in order to clarify the effect of frustration , we perform comparative calculations also on the random - bond @xmath0 af heisenberg model on the square lattice .",
    "our numerical results corroborates the previous observation that both the triangular and the kagome models exhibit the randomness - induced qsl - like behavior when the randomness exceeds a critical value @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the unfrustrated square model persistently exhibits the af lro up to the maximal randomness without showing the qsl - like behavior .",
    "the result hilights an important role of frustration , along with the randomness and the quantum fluctuation , in stabilizing the random - singlet state .",
    "the random - singlet states in the triangular and in the kagome models have some mutual similarities , but also some differences . in the triangular case",
    ", the random - singlet state keeps a certain amount of af short - range order even at the maximal randomness .",
    "while the dynamical structure factor @xmath5 of the triangular model exhibits a signature of the af lro and the magnon excitation in the regular and weakly random cases , it exhibits , in the strongly random case corresponding to the random - singlet state , a gapless behavir accompanied by a broad @xmath7-distribution extending to higher energy , which is dependen on the wavevector @xmath6 only weakly . in the kagome case , by contrast ,",
    "a signature of the af lro or the magnon excitation is hardly discernible either in the regular or in the random case .",
    "peaky features of @xmath5 still retained in the regular case give way to gapless behaviors in the strongly random case corresponding to the random singlet state .",
    "such features of @xmath5 are accompanied by an almost flat distribution in a wide range of @xmath7 and by an @xmath8 peak , which hardly dependes on the wavevector @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , these features of the computed @xmath5 of the strongly random kagome model are compared quite faborably with the recent inelastic - neutron scattering data on a single - crystal kagome herbersmithite @xcite .",

    "anyway , the gapless behavior with an almost flat distribution extending to higher @xmath7 irrespective of the @xmath116-value is a common feature of the observed dynamical structure factor of both the triangular and the kagome models for larger @xmath26 , and might be regarded as a characteristic of the random - singlet state .    in order to make comparison with the recent inelastic neutron - scattering data on a single - crystal of herbertsmithite@xcite",
    ", we provide in the insets of figs .  7 and 8 their low - energy part of the experimental data , which corresponds to the range indicated by the arrow in the main panel .",
    "since the experimental data now available are limited to the low - energy region of @xmath117mev , we show in the inset exactly this range , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath118 mev , by using an experimental estimate of @xmath119mev .",
    "this estimate of the exchange coupling @xmath25 of hermertsmithite is made via neutron - scattering measurements on powder samples@xcite .",
    "on comparison with the corresponding experimental data ( fig.2 of ref.@xcite ) , one finds a nice agreement especially for the strong randomness @xmath28 shown in fig.(d ) , including the features of ( 1 ) a plateau - like behavior observed for @xmath120 mev , ( 2 ) an @xmath8 peak observed at @xmath114 mev without any gap , and ( 3 ) the insensitivity of the overall behavior of @xmath5 on the wavevector @xmath6 .",
    "we emphasize that the data of the random model shown in fig.(d ) appears to resemble the experimental one much more than that of the non - random system of fig.(a ) .",
    "this observation certainly lends support to the view that the randomness is playing a significant role in the qsl state of herbertsmithite .",

    ", width=188 ]    very good agreement with experiment is also found for the magnetization curve . in fig .",
    "9 , we show the ground - state magnetization curve for the randomness @xmath127 for @xmath41 and @xmath122 , where the magnetization @xmath123 is normalized per formula unit of herbertsmithite , _",

    "then , the computed magnetization curve of fig.9 indeed exhibits an almost quantitative agreement with the recent experimental data given in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite in the same units .",
    "two features might be noticed .",
    "one is the absence of any plateau - like anomaly in the magnetization curve .",
    "as shown in the inset , it exhibits a near linear behavior in an entire region of @xmath128 up to the near saturation , except for some ` wavy ' behavior occurring at intermediate fields ( which becomes less visible for the stronger randomness of @xmath28 @xcite ) . as reported ref .",
    "@xcite , we have found that the plateau - like anomaly tends to go away for @xmath111 , yielding a near linear behavior .",
    "the other notable feature of the magnetization curve might be an upper - convex gapless behavior observed at weaker fields near @xmath129 .",
    "this enhanced behavior of the low - field magnetization is consistent with the curie - like behavior of the susceptibility observed for stronger randomness @xcite , and is likely to be borne by the ` free ' or ` almost free ' spins inevitably generated in the random - single state .",
    "we studied by means of an ed method the nature of spin correlations of the random - bond @xmath0 af heisenberg models on the triangular and the kagome lattices via the static and the dynamical spin structure factors . to hilight the possible importance of frustration",
    ", we also made a comparative calculation for the unfrustrated random - bond @xmath0 af heisenberg model on the square lattice .",
    "both the triangular and the kagome models exhibit the randomness - induced qsl behavior when the randomness exceeds a critical value as observed in previous studies , while the unfrustrated square model persistently exhibits the af lro up to the maximal randomness without showing the qsl behavior .",
    "this demonstrates that the frustration is certainly playing a role in stabilizing the random - singlet state .",
    "the random - singlet states in the triangular and the kagome models have some similarities , but also some differences .",
    "the random singlet state of the both models exhibit gapless behaviors , dependent on the wavevector @xmath6 only weakly , while the dynamical spin structure factor @xmath5 exhibit a broad distribution in @xmath7 extending to higher @xmath7 with an exponentail tail . especially in the strongly random kagome model ,",
    "@xmath5 hardly depends on @xmath6 and exhibits an almost flat distribution for a wide range of @xmath7 with a @xmath8 peak .    as discussed in ",
    "iv , our results for the dynamical spin structure factor for the strongly random kagome model compares quite favorably with the recent inelastic neutron - scattering data on the kagome herbersmithite , including ( 1 ) a plateau - like behavior observed for @xmath120 mev , ( 2 ) an @xmath8 peak observed @xmath114 mev without any gap , and ( 3 ) the insensitivity on the wavevector @xmath6 . since the present experimental data are limited to the low energy range @xmath117 mev , it would be interesting to perform further experiments in the higher energy range of @xmath130 mev to make further comparison .",
    "in addition , the computed magnetization curve is found to exhibit a good , almost quantitative agreement with the recent experimental data on herbertsmithite .    in making a truly quantitative comparison with the experimental data on herbertsmithite ,",
    "ones needs to examine several effects not considered in the present model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and the triangular layer between the kagome layers , _ etc_. how the results depend or do not depend on the particular form of the randomness needs further clarification . in particular",
    ", the possible effect of the dilution - type randomness pointed out experimentally in refs.@xcite and studied theoretically in ref.@xcite might be incorporated .    an important open theoretical question in the kagome model",
    "might be the distinction and the true relation between the observed two types of qsl - like states , _",
    "i.e. _ , the randomness - irrelevant qsl state realized at @xmath131 and the randomness - relevant qsl state ( random - singlet state ) realized at @xmath132 .",
    "one intuitive view of this transition ( or crossover ) occurring at @xmath133 might be that singlet states tend to exhibit an anderson localization there .",
    "the enhanced flat feature of @xmath82 observed in the random singlet state at @xmath132 is certainly consistent with such a picture .",
    "in this view , the randomness - irrelevant qsl state is an extended rvb - like state , while the randomness - relevant qsl state is an anderson - localized state of singlets . whether this naive picture captures correct physics behind the two types of qsl - like states needs further clarification .",
    "in contrast to the kagome case , the neutron - scattering data are not presently availabe for triangular organic salts due to the oganic nature of the material .",
    "another route to the random - singlet state of @xmath0 triangular afs might be an insulating mixed crystal cs@xmath134cu(br@xmath135cl@xmath136)@xmath137 .",
    "experiments suggest that this compound might exhibit a non - magnetic ground state in the range @xmath138 @xcite , at which the system possesses a considerable amount of randomness associated with the random arrangement of cl@xmath139 and br@xmath139 .",
    "interestingly , in this qsl - like regime , the gapless behavior including the @xmath13-linear low - temperature specific heat is observed @xcite .",
    "it might be interesting to perform neutron - scattering measurements on this compound in its qsl regime to make a comparison with our present data .    the naive picture of the random singlet state , which is observed in common with the triangular and the kagome models , might be that tightly bound spin singlets are preferentially formed at stronger @xmath140 bonds , leaving loosely bound spin singlets or nearly free spins at weaker @xmath140 bonds .",
    "of course , such simple assignment of singlets to randomly distributed @xmath140 bonds immediately meets contradiction or ` frustration ' , revealing that the singlet formation in the spatially random environment is not a trivial matter at all .",
    "a subtle balance between the potential energy due to the local energy gain arising from the nonuniform @xmath140 and the kinetic energy arising from the resonance of the local singlet states should determine the true ground state .",
    "in fact , in both cases of the triangular and the kagome models , we have observed that , although there generally exists a tendency that the strong singlet with larger negative @xmath141-value tends to be formed at strong bonds with large @xmath140-value , this tendency is quite often violated in the sense that strong local singlet is sometimes formed at weaker bonds , or the singlet formation remains weak even at stronger bonds .    in summary , we investigated the nature of spin correlations in the randomness - induced qsl - like state , the random - singlet state , of the random - bond @xmath0 af heisneberg model on the triangular and the kagome lattices by computing their static and dynamical spin structure factors by means of the exact diagonalization method",
    ". gapless behaviors accompnied by the broad distribution extending to higher energy , dependent on the wavevector only weakly , is observed in the dynamical spin structure factor @xmath5 in the random - singlet states of the both models in common . especially in the kagome case with strong randomness , @xmath5 hardly dependeds on the wavevector @xmath6 and exhibits an almost flat ditribution in a wide range of @xmath7 , accompanied by the @xmath8 peak .",
    "these features agree with the recent inelastic - neutron scattering data on a single - crystal hermertsmithite semi - quantitatively , suggesting that the qsl state observed in herbertsmithite is indeed the random - induced qsl state , _",

    "<S> inspired by the recent theoretical suggestion that the random - bond @xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the triangular and the kagome lattices might exhibit a randomness - induced quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) behavior when the strength of the randomness exceeds a critical value , and that this `` random - singlet state '' might be relevant to the qsl behaviors experimentally observed in triangular organic salts @xmath1and @xmath2_2}$ ] and in kagome herbertsmithite @xmath3 , we further investigate the nature of the static and the dynamical spin correlations of these models . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the static and the dynamical spin structure factors , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , by means of an exact diagonalization method . in both triangular and kagome models , </S>",
    "<S> the computed @xmath5 in the random - singlet state depends on the wavevector @xmath6 only weakly , robustly exhibiting gapless behaviors accompnied by the broad distribution extending to higher energy @xmath7 . especially in the strongly random kagome model , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 hardly depends on @xmath6 , and exhibits an almost flat distribution for a wide range of @xmath7 , together with a @xmath8 peak . </S>",
    "<S> these features agree semi - quantitatively with the recent neutron - scattering data on a single - crystal herbertsmithite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the computed magnetization curve agrees almost quantitatively with the experimental one recently measured on a single - crystal herbertsmithite . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the qsl state observed in herbersmithite might indeed be the randomness - induced qsl state , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the random - singlet state . </S>"
