    "to explain some phenomena which are hard to find natural interpretations in the canonical framework , people have tried to search for new structure beyond it .",
    "the molecular structure is one of the possible candidates .    because the mass of @xmath2 is close to the threshold of @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is of about 200 mev wide width , thus @xmath2 can be assumed as a @xmath1 molecular state . in the history , okun and",
    "voloshin studied the interaction between charmed mesons and proposed possibilities of the molecular states involving charmed quarks @xcite .",

    "@xcite , dubynskiy and voloshin proposed that there exists a possible new resonance at the @xmath1 threshold . because @xmath2 is observed along with @xmath11 which is of @xmath39 , thus the most possible quantum number of @xmath2 is @xmath39 .",

    "[ eta ] can be test in further experiments by analyzing the @xmath61 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "if this mechanism is correct , the @xmath61 invariant mass distribution should show the signature of @xmath59 or @xmath63 .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath64 is almost 89.1% , thus @xmath65 to @xmath66 is overwhelming . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are expected as special and main decay modes of @xmath2 . meanwhile @xmath65 also decay into @xmath67 and @xmath68 with the branching ratio @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 are important decay modes for @xmath2 .",
    "the typical decay modes of @xmath2 with the assignment of @xmath1 molecular state ( @xmath75 ) mainly include @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath7 , @xmath72 , @xmath71 , @xmath78 , @xmath74 , @xmath73 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "as one of the main decay modes , @xmath79 should be seen if @xmath2 is a @xmath1 molecular state with @xmath43 .",

    "besides these decays , of course @xmath2 can also decay into @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "because @xmath38 is forbidden for an isovector @xmath1 molecular state , thus one can exclude the assignment of isovector @xmath1 molecular state for @xmath2 .",

    "one finds that the branching ratio of @xmath89 is comparable with that of @xmath4 .",
    "thus one suggests further experiments to search @xmath2 in @xmath3 invariant mass distribution .",
    "how to distinguish these two assignments becomes a key problem . in the following",
    "we will illustrate the differences of @xmath2 decays for two assignments , which will be helpful to distinguish @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecular state pictures :    \\(1 ) search for @xmath5 , @xmath6 decay channels",
    ". if @xmath2 is @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are main decay channels . if @xmath2 is a @xmath1 molecular state , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , as the secondary decay modes , are comparable with @xmath7 and @xmath90 .",

    "@xmath7 and @xmath92 are main decay modes . however , as @xmath0 , besides decaying to @xmath5 , @xmath93 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 mainly decays into @xmath77",
