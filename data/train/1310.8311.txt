    "the quantitative theory of multipartite entanglement  @xcite is far from being a mature subject .",
    "the three - qubit problem , i.e. , the quantification of greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) entanglement in an arbitrary three - qubit state , may serve as an acid test for progress in this field .",
    "recent years have brought substantial advancements regarding methods to estimate entanglement measures  @xcite on the one hand , and in terms of exact solutions of very specific problems  @xcite on the other hand .",
    "although a mathematical insider of such methods would be able to produce lower bounds on the ghz - type entanglement in some generic cases the problem for the practitioner has remained open : given an arbitrary three - qubit mixed state , e.g. , the density matrix of an experimentally prepared state ( such as in recent experiments  @xcite ) , determine the quality of the ghz - type entanglement .",
    "the objective of this article is to fill this gap . in a recent publication  @xcite",
    "we have proposed a method to quantify ghz - type entanglement in arbitrary @xmath0-qubit states .",
    "the three - qubit case was spelled out in some detail , however , not at the level at which one could directly apply it without some in - depth study of the background .",
    "in contrast , the present work focuses on the practical application of these findings .",
    "we explain the ingredients of the method and the steps one has to go through in order to implement the approach .",
    "moreover , we provide an approximate analytical formula as well as a basic error estimate .",
    "why is it so important to obtain a _",
    "lower _ bound ? as the three - tangle for mixed states  like many other entanglement measures  is defined as a convex roof ( see below ) it is a _ minimum _",
    "taken over all possible decompositions of a given state .",
    "hence , any decomposition gives an _ upper _ bound , however , it is difficult to say by how much this bound overestimates the true three - tangle . in particular , knowing only upper bounds it can not be excluded that the three - tangle vanishes .",
    "therefore it is essential to obtain a lower bound .",
    "once a non - trivial lower bound is known it becomes meaningful to look for good upper bounds as well .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii , we start by outlining the method and the most important concepts it requires .",
    "these concepts are then explained in separate parts : ghz - symmetric states and the quantification of their three - tangle ( section iii ) , symmetrization of an arbitrary state ( section iv ) and analytical estimation of its three - tangle , and entanglement optimization ( section v ) . in section",
    "vi we highlight some experimental aspects of our method , and in section vii we present an error estimate .",
    "finally , in section viii we discuss the performance of our approach by applying it to several exactly solvable cases of three - qubit states / families .",
    "in this section we introduce all the concepts and ideas that are required to solve our task  to estimate the amount of ghz - type entanglement in three - qubit states . while we just mention them here they are be considered and explained in detail in the following sections .",
    "we exclusively consider three - qubit mixed states @xmath1 , that is , bounded positive definite hermitian operators that act on the hilbert space of three qubits @xmath2 .",
    "quantification of the entanglement in @xmath3 makes sense only if the states are normalized : @xmath4 .",
    "sometimes , however , we encounter states that are not normalized .",
    "suppose we are given a generic three - qubit state @xmath3 and would like to determine how much ghz - type entanglement it contains .",
    "the appropriate entanglement measure for this purpose is the three - tangle  @xcite , denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "it is the square root of the _ residual tangle _ originally introduced by coffman _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "a lower bound to the exact @xmath6 can be found by proceeding according to the following recipe :    1 .",
    "find the so - called _ normal form _ of @xmath3 .",
    "we denote the normal form @xmath7 . as this operation in general",
    "is non - unitary we have @xmath8 .",
    "+ if @xmath9 , the procedure terminates here and @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   optimize @xmath11 by applying local unitary operations to the qubits according to an appropriate criterion ( see below ) .",
    "the result is @xmath12 .",
    "project @xmath12 onto the ghz - symmetric states and read off the value for @xmath5 .",
    "the result @xmath13 leads to the desired lower bound : @xmath14    the idea behind this sequence is simple . in step  _ ( 3 )",
    "_ , the state is projected onto a family of symmetric states for which the exact three - tangle is known . in this projection , generally entanglement is lost , but never gained . in order to minimize the entanglement loss one has to optimize the state  which is the purpose of steps _ ( 1 ) _ and _ ( 2)_.",
    "the ghz - symmetric states  @xcite , denoted by @xmath15 , constitute the aforementioned peculiar family of symmetric states that facilitates the entire method described in this article .",
    "this is because the elements of this family contain much of the interesting physics of three - qubit states , but at the same time they are mathematically simple enough that many results can be calculated analytically .",
    "the ghz symmetry comprises the operations under which the well - known ghz state @xmath16 remains invariant , that is ,    1 .",
    "qubit permutations , 2 .",
    "simultaneous three - qubit flips ( i.e. , application of @xmath17 ) , 3 .",

    "however , the local bases will not always be arranged this way .",
    "therefore , the result for @xmath69 can be improved by applying local unitaries to @xmath3 .",

    "consider the ghz state @xmath70 .",
    "symmetrization maps it to the lower corner of the triangle in fig .  1 , i.e. , to a completely separable state .",
    "naturally we would like to avoid such entanglement losses .",
    "this is why we have to optimize the state before projecting it .",
    "while optimization can not exclude entanglement loss , it may reduce it substantially . in the example",
    ", the optimization is particularly simple . applying @xmath20 ( a local operation that does not change entanglement ) to the first qubit yields",
    "ghz@xmath39 which preserves its full entanglement under the projection @xmath65 .    .",

    "the example in the preceding section shows that projection onto the ghz - symmetric states may serve to quantitatively assess the three - tangle of a state , and that optimization prior to projection may enhance the reliability of the result . clearly , symmetrization can only _ reduce _ , and never _ enhance _ the entanglement of a state  @xcite . therefore",
    ", if the projection image @xmath76 contains three - tangle , then the original state @xmath3 also does . that is why we also call this method a _ quantitative witness_. the idea that witnessing entanglement can be improved by optimization",
    "was discussed by various authors , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .    at first glance",
    "it looks difficult to find generally valid criteria to improve an arbitrary state . in this section ,",
    "we sketch why the optimization steps _ ( 1 ) _ and _ ( 2 ) _ are appropriate for achieving this goal",
    ".      the normal form of a multipartite quantum state is a fundamental concept that was introduced by verstraete _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and discussed in detail also in ref .",
    "it applies to arbitrary ( finite - dimensional ) multi - qudit states .",
    "here we focus on @xmath0-qubit states only .",
    "the essential merit of the normal form in the present context is that among all states that are locally equivalent to the original state , it is the one that maximizes a certain type of entanglement measures such as the three - tangle .",
    "let us elaborate on this point .",
    "the defining property of the normal form @xmath7 is that _ all _ local density matrices are proportional to the identity @xmath77 therefore the normal form is unique only up to local unitaries .",
    "local equivalence to the original state @xmath3 means that @xmath7 can be obtained from @xmath3 by applying local operations @xmath78    here the @xmath79 are _ invertible _ single - qubit operations that are not necessarily norm - preserving . for the normal form we additionally require @xmath80 , or more technically , @xmath81 .",
    "note that sometimes the normal form can be reached only asymptotically .",
    "this is especially true for all pure states with vanishing three - tangle , where the normal form is simply zero .    how can we practically find the normal form",
    "there is a simple iterative procedure described in ref .",
    "let us denote the reduced local density matrix of the @xmath82th qubit by @xmath83 .",
    "one starts by transforming @xmath3 according to @xmath84 which brings @xmath85 into a form @xmath86 .",
    "next one applies the analogous step to the second qubit .",
    "note that , while making the second qubit @xmath86 this property on the first qubit is usually destroyed",
    ". then one continues with the third qubit , and so on , to the @xmath0th qubit , and then all over again .",
    "the convergence of this procedure was proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the result is the normal form . in each step of the iteration",
    "the trace is reduced ( or unchanged ) .",
    "as the three - tangle remains unchanged under a transformation @xmath79 this means that , after renormalization of the transformed state , the three - tangle has _",
    "increased_. this is the reason why the normal form is a useful first optimization step for our purposes .",
    "if we normalize the normal form the resulting state @xmath11 has maximal three - tangle in the local orbit of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that ghz - symmetric states  which play a central role in our discussion  are naturally given in their normal form .",
    "as the normal form is unique only up to local unitaries another optimization is required in order to find the appropriate local qubit bases .",
    "that is , we transform the normalized state @xmath11 by applying a unitary operation @xmath87 @xmath88 the obvious criterion is to maximize the three - tangle @xmath89 that is , @xmath90 clearly eq .",
    "gives the largest possible value of @xmath5 .",
    "however , due to the complicated structure of the function in eq .",
    "it appears hopeless to obtain analytical results .",
    "alternatively one may choose optimization criteria that do not necessarily give the maximal value of @xmath5 but , depending on the state @xmath3 , can possibly be treated analytically .",
    "examples are the overlap ( fidelity ) with the ghz state @xmath91 or the hilbert - schmidt distance from the ghz state @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "in order to apply our method to an experimentally prepared state its density matrix needs to be determined . this",
    "is done using quantum state tomography  @xcite . to this end",
    "we note that the density matrix can be represented in a basis of local pauli operators @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "each term in eq .   corresponds to a joint measurement of local observables . to obtain the optimized lower bound for the three - tangle ( as described in the preceding section ) full tomography",
    "is required . however , even in a small system like three qubits , full tomography requires the measurement of 63 observables ( + extra measurements for normalization ) and is therefore expensive .",
    "there are ways to reduce the effort , as it is often the case that the experimentally prepared state is not completely unknown .    the first possibility is related to the observation that the analytical approximation eq .",
    "contains only the four entries @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors describe a general method to determine the fidelity with the ghz state . for three qubits",
    "it requires four measurement settings .",
    "those settings determine the diagonal elements and the real part of @xmath97 separately , so that they are indeed sufficient to calculate the projection of the state onto the ghz symmetric states .",
    "if the off - diagonal matrix element is not known to be real , it is worthwhile determining the imaginary part as well and to use the absolute value instead of the real part ( this is equivalent to a very restricted unitary optimization on the results ) .",
    "it turns out that the additional setting @xmath100 ( i.e. , measurement of @xmath101 for all three qubits ) is sufficient for that purpose .",
    "note that the best choice of local bases is such that the fidelity of the ghz state in those bases is maximized . in a sense",
    ", this corresponds to carrying out the local unitary optimization for eq .   directly in the experiment while it would not be possible numerically , as not all elements of the density matrix are known .",
    "another alternative to full tomography is permutationally invariant tomography ( pit )  @xcite",
    ". the experimental setup of pit effectively means to apply the permutation averaging part of the twirling operation ( described in section  ii , eq .  ) directly in the experiment , before the measurement . therefore using pit will in general result in a worse lower bound .",
    "however , if the true state has approximate permutation symmetry  which will often be the case in experiments aiming at ghz states",
    " one may hope that only little entanglement information is lost in the projection @xmath102 . for three qubits",
    "10 settings are required  @xcite . as the result of pit is a valid density matrix the optimization procedure",
    "may be applied to @xmath103 as well to improve the estimate of @xmath5 .",
    "also in the case of performing pit it is possible to reduce the experimental effort by only measuring the four ghz matrix elements . if we content ourselves with the real part of the measurement only , the three settings @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are sufficient .",
    "the real part of the off - diagonal element is determined from @xmath107 and @xmath108 as @xmath109 .",
    "the imaginary part requires the additional settings @xmath110 and @xmath100 , so that @xmath111 .    in summary , we see that there is a trade - off between the experimental effort and the quality of the lower bound for @xmath5 .",
    "obviously the best estimate is achieved by doing full tomography of the state and then applying the procedure of section  ii to the result . in this case , the best possible lower bound with our method is achieved .    in the opposite extreme case ,",
    "one measures the ghz matrix elements @xmath96 , @xmath99 , @xmath112 with an experimental pit setup using just three measurement settings in a specific local basis , however , at the cost that no further optimization of the bound is possible ( but limited pre - measurement optimization by appropriately choosing the local measurement bases ) .",
    "two additional measurement settings allow to determine also @xmath113 , which may already improve the bound .    between those two extreme possibilities",
    "there is full pit ( requiring much fewer settings than full tomography , but maintaining the possibility to numerically optimizing the bound for @xmath5 ) .",
    "we note that  since the three - setting and/or five - setting measurements use the same setup and a strict subset of the measurements for full pit ",
    "they can be carried out first , and if this is not sufficient for a reasonable lower bound , one can proceed by doing full pit without wasting experimental effort .    with standard tomography ,",
    "the minimal effort is four measurement settings , which is slightly more than in a pit setup .",
    "if the imaginary part of the off - diagonal matrix is desired as well , only one additional setting is required , so standard and pit setups are equally efficient for that case .",
    "as , in general , entanglement is lost in the projection @xmath114 it is desirable to get an idea by how much @xmath115 underestimates the three - tangle of @xmath116 .",
    "recall that we know the value @xmath117 _ exactly _ and , moreover , @xmath118 .",
    "however , we do not know how much larger @xmath119 actually is .",
    "consequently we need an _ upper _ bound to @xmath119 to estimate the error .    in principle",
    ", any available decomposition of @xmath116 provides an upper bound to @xmath119 .",
    "the simplest upper bound is @xmath120 .",
    "a good upper bound can be found numerically using elaborate methods as described in refs .",
    "alternatively , one can refine the simple estimate by applying a geometrical method that represents a variant of the ideas in ref .",
    "it uses the convexity of both the state space and of the three - tangle and is most easily explained by considering fig .",
    "4 .     at its right end point .",
    "a density matrix @xmath3 ( light green ) is projected by the twirling operation eq .   onto @xmath76 ( red ) in the ghz - symmetric states , thereby reducing the three - tangle ( which is displayed in the vertical direction ) .",

    "apart from the ingredients of the method we have provided a more detailed discussion of the approximation to the three - tangle by projector - based entanglement witnesses ( and the corresponding quantitative witnesses ) , section iii.c , as well as an analytical lower bound for the three - tangle of an arbitrary three - qubit density matrix , eq .  .",
    "moreover , we have considered the tradeoff between the quality of the lower bound and the experimental effort to determine elements of the density matrix .    as the procedure explained here",
    "gives only a lower bound to the three - tangle one would like to know about the possible error . to this end , we have described an error estimate based on simple geometrical considerations .",
    "finally , we have studied the performance of the method by comparing its results to exactly solvable cases for the three - tangle . from this",
    "we may conclude that the method often works well , however , in particular for small three - tangle in the original state the bound may substatially underestimate the entanglement .",
