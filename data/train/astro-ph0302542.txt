    "@xcite confirmed this view .",
    "@xcite observed a periodic ( @xmath10 ) wave - like variation , which occurred in the visual light curve between eclipses from 1985.7 .",
    "as the most satisfying explanation they suggested a brightness modulation due to variation in the mass transfer rate from the red giant to the hot component .",
    "analysing historical 18891998 light curve , @xcite identified the real change of the orbital period at a rate @xmath11 between 1896 april and 1985 september .",
    "they also noted that during quiescence , the light curve has characteristic features similar to those observed in cvs .",
    "recently , @xcite refined the mean orbital period to 604.45@xmath12 days .",
    "as to the configuration , @xcite proposed a binary model , in which the red giant fills its roche lobe and loses mass to an evolved , @xmath1330000k hot , compact object surrounded by a moderately dense gas cloud or a thick ring .",
    "@xcite found that the observed uv continuum colours for are well comparable to those derived from a model of an accretion disk around a main sequence accretor .",
    "recently , @xcite , having new radial velocities of the red giant , determined its mass function to 0.055@xmath14 and the projected rotation velocity of 11@xmath15 .",
    "assuming co - rotation , they derived the giant radius of 130@xmath16 and by comparing its adequate stellar parameters with rgb / agb evolutionary tracs in the hr diagram , they suggested the giant mass as 2@xmath14 , and , consequently from the mass function , the hot component mass as 0.75@xmath14 .",
    "based on these parameters , @xcite suggested that the hot component in is most probably a white dwarf and the cool component is deeply inside of its roche lobe ( however , as we will show later in this paper , the giant in this system does most probably fill its roche lobe ) .",
    "most recently , @xcite , having radial velocities of both components , determined their masses as @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "they obtained the radial velocity curve of the hot star under assumption that the broad emission wings of the h@xmath19 , h@xmath20 and he4686 profiles originate from the inner accretion disk or an envelope around the central star .",
    "in addition , the authors suggested that the central absorption in hydrogen line profiles is formed in the neutral part of the giant s wind , which is concentrated in the orbital plane .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the sed in the continuum between 0.12 and 3.4@xmath0 m with the aim to determine a basic configuration of the hot object in . in sect .",

    "4 we compare the observed sed and those given by current models of symbiotic stars , including a standard ionization model and models with an accretion disk . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we discuss their physical plausibility and suggest basic structure of the hot object .",
    "to reconstruct the sed of in the range of 0.12 to 3.4@xmath0 m we used the broad - band optical and infrared @xmath21 and @xmath22 photometry and the iue ( international ultraviolet explorer ) low - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the optical / ir magnitudes were summarized by @xcite and some new observations were recently published by @xcite . to determine the star s brightness in eclipses we used photometric measurements of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "stellar magnitudes were converted to fluxes according to the calibration of @xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet fluxes were taken from fig .",
    "5 of @xcite .",
    "we used average values from those measured out of eclipses ( i.e. between orbital phases @xmath25 ; the rms within 10 - 15% ) and values from the mid eclipse . to get better coverage of the ultraviolet continuum we added a few values from fig . 2 of @xcite and measurements presented in table 4 of @xcite .    finally , we dereddened observations with @xmath26 = 0.26 @xcite using the extinction curve of @xcite in the uv / optical region , while in the ir wavelengths we used reddening ratios of @xcite .",

    "3.4@xmath0 m sed in the continuum of .",
    "this suggests a high luminosity of the hot object , similar to that of its cool companion .",
    "the out - of - eclipse continuum is characterized by : ( i ) a round far - uv shape with decreasing fluxes to shorter wavelengths , and ( ii ) a flat profile in the near - uv / optical region . both the steep far - uv ( @xmath27 ) continuum and the prominent balmer jump in emission ",
    "characteristic features of the continuum of symbiotic stars during quiescence  are not present .",

    "accordingly , the observed flux , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , of the nebular continuum at the wavelength @xmath36 , can be written as @xmath37 in which @xmath38 is the distance to the object , @xmath39 is the volume of the ionized zone and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the total ( f - b + f - f ) volume emission coefficient per electron and per ion in the wavelength scale .",

    "because of having defined the continuum only by fluxes at selected wavelengths ( i.e. only the continuous radiation can be investigated ) , we will assume a steady - state , time - independent accretion disk around a central star of mass @xmath44 and radius @xmath45 .",
    "further , the accretion disk is optically thick and radiates locally like a blackbody ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a useful characteristic of the disk is its maximum temperature , which occurs at @xmath60 and has a value 0.488@xmath61 .",
    "the final stage of the mass transferred throughout the accretion disk is its deceleration and landing onto the accreting star .",
    "this happens in the so called _ boundary layer _",
    "( bl ) , in which the inner disk material loses its kinetic energy to match the surface velocity of the star .",
    "if the accreting star rotates at a small fraction of its breakup velocity , then the bl emits a luminosity comparable to that of the disk .",
    "contrary , when the star rotates close to breakup , there should be little emission from the bl ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the geometry of the bl can be approximated by a ring with thickness @xmath62 surrounding the accreting star .",
    "then the luminosity , @xmath63 , of its area , @xmath64 , for a non - rotating star is comparable to that of the accretion disk .",
    "so , @xmath65 the effective temperature of the bl can be derived with the help of eq .",
    "5 , and according to @xcite it can be approximated as @xmath66 in the following section we use these components of radiation to fit the observed sed .",
    "figure 1 shows a faint component of the nebular radiation seen during eclipses . we compared a grid of models of the nebular continuum to these fluxes and selected that with @xmath67k , which corresponds to the best fit to observations ( fig .",

    "4 , table 2 ) .",
    "we integrated the disk contributions to its outer radius @xmath100 , which can be considered as the smallest dimension of the disk for these parameters .",
    "this is because the disk temperature between the surface of the accretor and @xmath101 is higher than 5000k , and thus radiative contributions of this part of the disk are important to explain the uv / optical sed ( i.e. @xmath51 can not be smaller than @xmath102 ) , but the disk annuli with @xmath103 ( i.e. @xmath104k ) do not contribute significant emission at uv / optical wavelengths , and are negligible with respect to the radiation of the giant in the ir region ( i.e. @xmath51 can be larger than @xmath105 ) .",

    "the accretion rate of @xmath133 ( sect .",
    "4.3.1 ) derived from the orbital period change corresponds to the conservative mass transfer from the giant star onto its companion .",
    "however , successful fits of the uv continuum require at least one order of magnitude higher rates to balance the observed luminosity .",
    "this discrepancy can be caused by mass loss from the system , which makes the orbital period increase ( cf .",
    "so , the mass transfer rate and the mass loss rate rival each other in the orbital period change . mass loss from is indicated by radial velocities of absorption components of hydrogen lines . already @xcite revealed a p - cygni type of hydrogen line profiles on three plates from 1900 , 1901 and 1908 .",
    "@xcite measured absorption components of the h@xmath134 and/or h@xmath135 line profiles between 1953 and 1972 .",
    "they determined an average position of these absorptions at -85.2kms@xmath136 .",
    "recently , @xcite measured radial velocity of the central absorption component of h@xmath19 at -96kms@xmath136 on spectra taken between 1988 and 2001 .",
    "these values are shifted by -17 to -28kms@xmath136 relative to the systemic velocity ( -68kms@xmath136 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus reflect a mass loss from the system . under such conditions",
    "the observed decrease in the orbital period requires a much higher mass transfer than that given by conservative case .",
    "therefore , the mass transfer rate ( i.e. the accretion rate ) of @xmath133 can be considered only as a lower limit .",
    "this fact allow us to estimate the accretor radius @xmath7 for @xmath9 to balance the observed accretion luminosity irrespectively to the accretion disk model .",
    "such the large @xmath45 precludes a white dwarf to be the accreting star in .",
    "observations and the model energy distributions discussed in this paper suggest that the sole energy source in is accretion .",
    "this view is also supported by the behaviour in its historical , 1889 - 2001 , light curve , in which no large ( 5 - 7mag ) outbursts as in symbiotic novae have been observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the light curve has characteristic features similar to those observed in cvs @xcite , which suggests that the basic principles of mass transfer in are similar to those of cvs .",
    "these arguments suggest that the red giant in fills up ( or is close to ) its roche lobe .",
    "contrary , if the giant in underfills its roche lobe , then the mass transfer is via accretion from a stellar wind .",
    "however , this can not be true .",
    "if this were the case , there would have been a huge ( unrealistic ) mass loss via the wind ( at least of @xmath137 ) to get the accretion rate required to balance the observed luminosity of the hot object . in that case",
    ", the wind mass loss would make the orbital period _ increase _ , while the observations show that the period _",
    "decreases_. the latter can only be due to the roche lobe overflow .",
    "other observational results allow this possibility .",
    "for example , the giant s radius inferred from eclipses , @xmath138 @xcite , is equal to its volume - equivalent roche radius for the orbital inclination of 70@xmath139 @xcite .",
    "the v - shape of the eclipse profile supports this possibility ( e.g. fig .",
    "8 of * ? ? ?",
    "further , the 106-day periodic variation with the amplitude of a few @xmath1400.01mag observed in the visual light curve @xcite could be understood as a response of the giant s radius to its mass loss .",
    "generally , after losing an amount of mass , the giant will restore its hydrostatic equilibrium , which leads to variation in difference of the radius of the star and its roche lobe . in the case of the presence of a deep convective envelope in the giant star ,",
    "its radius rapidly increases and the star can run into a violent mass loss instability ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more detail ) .",
    "such a transient high mass transfer rate from the red giant to the hot component could be responsible for a higher level of the activity observed during 1900 - 01 , 1935 - 36 and 1985 - 99 @xcite .",
    "the nebular component of radiation indicates the presence of a hot ionizing source in . in the models with accretion disk the ionizing source",
    "is represented by the bl .",
    "the nebular emission has a luminosity @xmath141 (= uneclipsed nebula without emission lines ) , which places strong constraint on the bl luminosity and ionizing capacity . for parameters of the fit shown in fig . 4 and described in sect .",
    "4.3.1 , @xmath142 and @xmath143k ( table 2 ) .",
    "to balance the @xmath144 luminosity , a fraction of the bl emission below 912  has to be @xmath145 for @xmath146 , eq .",
    "13 yields the factor @xmath147 , which forces @xmath148k ( fig .",
    "2 ) . thus the bl characterized by these quantities can balance well the observed nebular luminosity , @xmath144 .    however , our modeling the sed _ with _ the bl ( sect .",
    "4.3.2 , table 2 ) does not provide satisfactory fit ( figs . 5 , 6 ) .",
    "this implies that we can not see the hotter inner parts of the disk and that any radiation generated in the bl is absorbed and diffused in the disk in the direction to the observer , but it is free in directions to the poles to ionize there the circumstellar matter .",
    "this situation thus produces two components of radiation of a very different temperature regimes observed in the ultraviolet spectrum : a relatively cool continuum , which was investigated in this paper , and a hot ionizing source seen through the nebular emission .",
    "it is plausible that the lack of the bl emission in the continuum results only from a different real geometry of the accretion disk ( probably more extended at its edge ) than we adopted in our modeling ( eq .",
    "so , if the disk is rather thick in its outer parts , then we can see essentially only its outer edge , which occults the bl at the disk s center for a high orbital inclination .",
    "such a disk structure was suggested for the first time by @xcite for interacting binaries in which the accreting star in non - degenerate .",
    "our models of the observed sed ( sects .",
    "4.1 , 4.3.1 ) suggest that the hot object in consists of an accretion disk around a central star embedded in a hot corona .",
    "this basic configuration can be independently verified by the eclipse profile , which is a function of wavelength . in the following two sections",
    "we therefore explore its two main characteristics  the different eclipse depth and width in the uv / optical / near - ir region on the basis of our model with accretion disk",
    ".      already @xcite noted that there is no total eclipse below 3600 , and 70% of the hottest continuum ( below 1400 ) is seen even at central eclipse .",
    "recently @xcite demonstrated this behaviour on the ultraviolet iue light curves .",
    "generally , the eclipse depth is given by the ratio of fluxes observed _ in _ and _ out _ of eclipse .",
    "in view of our models , it is determined by the ratio of the n+g to all considered components of radiation . in fig .",
    "7 we compared the modeled eclipse depth according to the solution shown in fig . 4 and that observed in the light curves ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we can see that our model explains well the wavelength - dependent depth of eclipses .",
    "observations show a very broad eclipse profile in the far - uv ( @xmath149 of the orbital phase , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in the optical / near - ir the profile is characterized by a narrow core ( @xmath150 ) with shallow wings @xcite . the hot object in consists of basically two components  the extended nebula and the central star with an accretion disk .",
    "let @xmath151 and @xmath152 be the fluxes emitted by a surface element of the projected nebula and the central source , respectively , to the sky .",
    "the observed eclipse profile then can be characterized by the ratio @xmath153 .",
    "the case of @xmath154 makes the eclipse profile very broad , because the extended nebula contributes significant emission with respect to that of the small central source . on the other hand , @xmath155 results in a narrow eclipse core determined by the central source , accompanied with shallow wings as the nebula is faint ( see also fig . 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our approximation and for a spherical nebula , it is simple to find that @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are integrated fluxes of the nebula and the central source at a given wavelength .",
    "figure 4 shows that the ratio @xmath159 is a function of the wavelength , which thus represents the primary cause of the observed wavelength - dependent eclipse width .",
    "therefore , we plotted this ratio in fig .",
    "8 according to modeled components of radiation shown in fig .",

    "( 14 ) , fig .",
    "8 shows that @xmath160 which answers the question why the eclipses are broader in the ultraviolet than in the optical / near - ir region .",
    "a more rigorous approach , in which the parameter @xmath153 is treated as a function of the radial distance from the central object , would give a more accurate information about the nebula structure .",
    "however , this analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the results of this study may be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) based on the ultraviolet iue low - resolution spectra and the broad - band optical and infrared @xmath21 and @xmath22 photometry , we re - constructed the sed in the continuum between 0.12 and 3.4@xmath0 m . by this way we revealed a very high luminosity of the hot object in the binary , @xmath1 .",

    "this suggests that the configuration of differs significantly from the typical configuration of symbiotic binaries during their quiescent phases .",
    "\\(iii ) the uv / optical / ir sed can be fitted by a simple blackbody accretion disk embedded in an extended hot corona ( @xmath35000k ) .",
    "the standard thin disk model requires a high accretion rate @xmath161 onto the central star with a radius @xmath6 . any accretion process at @xmath8 ( sect .",
    "5.1 ) for @xmath9 limits the accretor radius to @xmath7 to balance the observed accretion luminosity .",
    "this result suggests that the accreting star in is non - degenerate .",
    "\\(iv ) te basic configuration of the hot object  the accretion disk embedded in an extended nebula  allow us to understand the observed wavelength - dependent depth and width of the eclipse profile ( figs .",
    "7 , 8) : the eclipse _ width _ results from that the hot object consists of the two geometrically very different components of radiation ( n + ad ) , the ratio of which is a function of the wavelength .",
    "the eclipse _ depth _ is given by a different ratio of the uneclipsed ( n+g ) to the total light throughout the spectrum .",
    "\\(v ) models with the accretion disk and its bl ( @xmath162 ) failed to fit the far - uv sed .",
    "however , the presence of a very hot region in the system is indirectly indicated through the strong nebular emission .",
