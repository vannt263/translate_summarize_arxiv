    "the standard model ( sm ) provides an excellent description of elementary particles and interactions , which has further been confirmed by the discovery of the sm - like higgs particle at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , there are still some experimental results showing the tantalizing hints to new physics beyond the sm .",
    "especially , one of the biggest discrepancies between the experimental values and the sm predictions comes from the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( amm ) or @xmath3 for short , known as the @xmath3 anomaly .    in 2001",
    ", the e821 experiment at brookhaven national lab ( bnl )  @xcite showed that the measured value of @xmath4 exceeds the sm prediction by about @xmath5 , where the different standard deviations are originated from the various theoretical methods for estimating the hadronic contributions , by applying either the @xmath6  @xcite or the @xmath7-based  @xcite data .",
    "the value of the discrepancy between the measurement and sm prediction is given by  @xcite @xmath8 to explain this anomaly , many models have been proposed ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . for example , by including the mixings of the muon with some new tev - scale heavy leptons  @xcite , the new contribution to @xmath3 is roughly the same order as the @xmath9- and @xmath10-boson ones due to the enhancement from the heavy lepton masses .",
    "however , most of these models predict visible lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes . in particular , the decay of @xmath11 usually gives one of the most stringent constraints , due to the accuracy of its experimental searches .",
    "for example , the meg collaboration has recently renewed the upper bound on the branching ratio of this process to @xmath12 ( @xmath13 c.l . )",
    "@xcite . as a result , it is natural and necessary to use this updated limit to constrain the structure of new physics behind the @xmath3 anomaly .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to propose some general methods of building models to not only explain the @xmath3 anomaly but also satisfy the stringent @xmath1 constraint .",
    "we first explore this problem from the effective field theory ( eft ) perspective , finding that it is very challenging to accomplish both processes simultaneously with the same uv cutoff and the similar order of the wilson coefficients .",
    "we then focus on some simplified models with new physics perturbatively coupled to the sm fields so that the leading order contributions to @xmath3 and @xmath14 appear at the one - loop order . by collecting all one - loop contributions with different spins ( @xmath15 ) , cp properties and electric charges of new particles ,",
    "we find two general methods to reconcile the tension between the @xmath3 anomaly and the @xmath14 constraint : the gim mechanism and the non - universal couplings .",
    "for the latter , we present a simple uv - complete leptoquark model as an illustration . in our study",
    ", we assume that all of the sm contributions to the muon @xmath0 are already well understood and appropriately calculated .",
    "the discrepancy mainly arises from new physics . for clarity ,",
    "we will use @xmath16 to denote the new physics correction to @xmath3 .",

    "iii , we classify the general new physics models by the leading - order one - loop diagrams for the muon @xmath0 in terms of their different structures and internal particle contents . in sec .",
    "iv , we proposes two general methods : the gim mechanism and the non - universal couplings , which can resolve the tension between these two processes .",
    "finally , a short summary is given in sec .",
    "it is quite natural to consider the constraint on new physics from the lfv mode @xmath11 to explain the @xmath3 anomaly from the eft perspective since the structure of the leading effective operators for both processes is essentially the same except for that the outgoing muon is replaced by an electron , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "[ subfig : fig1 ]    the effective operators for @xmath3 and @xmath14 are given by : @xmath17 respectively , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 . at this stage , we differentiate the cutoff scales as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and the wilson coefficients of the left and right - handed couplings as @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath3 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "note that we have extracted the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath24 from the wilson coefficients for the normalization .",
    "we can easily derive the contribution to @xmath16 from eq .",
    ", given by @xmath25 with this formula , we find that the desired value of @xmath26 can be obtained by taking @xmath27  gev with the natural value of @xmath28 .",
    "it is also straightforward to evaluate the branching ratio for the decay process @xmath29 , given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the fermi constant and @xmath32 is used for the normalization . from eq . and",
    "@xmath33 , one obtains @xmath34 if we take the wilson coefficients @xmath35 to be @xmath36 , the cutoff scale @xmath21 should be at least of @xmath37  gev .    from the above discussion",
    ", we see that there is at least a five - order scale gap between the cutoff needed to solve the @xmath3 anomaly and that required by the @xmath14 constraint . in other words , if we assume that the same new physics contributes to both processes , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath38 as indicated by the @xmath3 anomaly , the predicted branching ratio for the @xmath1 decay is naturally 5 orders larger than the current experimental bound , unless we choose the wilson coefficients @xmath35 of @xmath39 or even smaller , which are obviously quite unnatural from the general eft philosophy .",
    "clearly , we come to the conclusion that it is challenging for a natural model to obtain the required contribution to @xmath40 while satisfying the current @xmath14 constraint from the eft aspect .",
    "before providing the general methods to reconcile the tension between @xmath3 and the constraint from @xmath11 , let us first see how general new physics models perturbatively coupled to the sm part can solve the @xmath3 anomaly .",
    "we shall work in a simplified framework in which only the relevant particles and the renormalizable parts of the lagrangian related to @xmath3 are given . in this setup , it is enough to only consider the leading one - loop contributions to @xmath41 . for simplicity , we confine the spin of the loop particles to be not larger than 1 , but we do not restrict their charges as to keep the discussion general . in this way , the leading one - loop feynman diagrams can be classified into 4 categories , as explicitly shown in fig .",

    "note that the couplings @xmath220 and @xmath221 have totally different dependences on the more fundamental yukawa couplings @xmath222 , so that they actually have no direct relations .",
    "we can tune these yukawa couplings to make @xmath221 positive and larger than @xmath220 by at least four orders of magnitude so as to fit the @xmath40 deviation and suppress @xmath1 to the allowed order simultaneously , which represents the essence of the method of the non - universal couplings .",
    "note that as the process @xmath14 does not give some prominent constraint to this leptoquark interpretation of the muon @xmath0 anomaly , we need to consider other more stringent constraints .",

    "motivated by the long - standing @xmath3 anomaly and the recently updated @xmath143 upper bound , we have examined the correlations between @xmath143 and @xmath3 .",
    "the general eft analysis tells us that it is difficult in explaining the muon @xmath0 anomaly while satisfying the @xmath143 bound in a natural theory with @xmath2 wilson coefficients , since the cutoff scale obtained by fitting the required @xmath3 discrepancy predicts an unbearably large @xmath1 rate . after compiling all of the one - loop diagram formulae for the @xmath3 corrections ,",
    "we have proposed two promising methods to eliminate this tension between the new physics contributions to @xmath3 and @xmath1 : the gim mechanism and the non - universality of couplings . for the latter method ,",
    "a leptoquark model has been illustrated as a simple example .",
    "as expected , with the appropriate choice of leptoquark yukawa couplings , it is possible to achieve the goal to understand the @xmath3 anomaly while keeping an experimentally allowed @xmath1 branching ratio .    as discussed in our leptoquark model , even if the new physics accounting for the required @xmath41 can escape the @xmath1 bound with our two methods , we still need to check other constraints , such as the contact interactions , the unitarity of the ckm and/or pmns matrices , and so on , especially for those with the same coupling dependence as the explanation of the @xmath3 anomaly . finally , we hope that our investigation on the possible relation between the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the decay @xmath1 may shed light on the structure of new physics .",
