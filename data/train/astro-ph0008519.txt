    "also loosely denoted as `` starbursts '' here ) knowledge about massive stars  their evolution , as well as radiative , mechanical , and chemical feedback  and their relative number compared to lower mass stars is of prime importance .",
    "however , the properties and evolution of individual metal - rich high mass stars , massive star populations , and their initial mass function ( imf ) in metal - rich environments are still poorly known .",

    "very little is , however , known about the imf at high metallicities .    indirect indications for a possible systematic difference of the imf come e.g.  from studies on ir - luminous starburst galaxies , where generally a soft radiation field is observed , which , among other explanations , can be interpreted as a deficit of massive stars ( cf .  goldader et al .",
    "1997 , luhman et al .",

    "the extended burst scenario at ages @xmath1 715 myr also explains the presence of red ( super)giants revealed by the tio bands ( sect .  4 ) .",
    "even at a quantitative level we note , somewhat surprisingly , that the broad tio features ( especially the 6250   feature ) in the majority of objects are quite well reproduced by our seds , where kurucz models are used to describe cool stars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . in any case , we find that the overall shape of the sed alone already indicates a mixture of populations with different ages .",
    "independent of the amount of extinction , single stellar populations are not able to produce the required relative amount of blue ( @xmath5 5100  ) to red light .",
    "last , but not least , the overall seds in the optical range of all objects are very well reproduced with the extended burst models at @xmath68=0.02.=0.04 models . ] the seds , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , correspond to the model for t @xmath62=8 myr , taken at the age deduced from the observed h@xmath8  equivalent width ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "both the predicted stellar and nebular continuum emission are included in the models . in the present case the latter is of importance only for emission shortward of the balmer break .",
    "however , in this domain a quantitative comparison is not possible since the h and he continuous emission coefficients depend quite strongly on the electron temperature which is poorly known for the present objects .",
    "as discussed above , the extinction suffered by the stellar continuum ( @xmath67 ) is taken as a free parameter , since it may differ from the value derived from the gas ( balmer decrement ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath67 are systematically _ smaller _ than the values from the gas ( mkn 309 : @xmath72 0.15 / @xmath730.68 , mkn 589 : 0.5/0.72 ; mkn 710 : 0.25/0.52 , mkn 1199 : 0.2/0.55 , mkn 1259 : 0.2/0.60 ) with differences similar to those found e.g.  by calzetti ( 1997 ) and mas - hesse & kunth ( 1999 ) .",
    "for mkn 309 , with the largest @xmath74 , we have independent evidence showing that @xmath75 : the observed ratio ew(h ) @xmath60/ ew(h ) @xmath42= 8.9   clearly exceeds the maximum ( typical ) value of @xmath1 7.5 ( @xmath1 56 ) predicted for instantaneous ( extended ) burst models / ew(h ) @xmath42  is larger than the typical value predicted for extended burst models .",

    "any other effect ( underlying old population , multiple components etc . ) will further reduce the predicted ew(h ) @xmath60/ew(h ) @xmath42  ratio ; the only way to bring both in agreement is by adopting a larger extinction for the gas .",
    "accounting for the differential extinction and adopting the seds shown in fig.[fig7 ] , the observed ew(h ) @xmath60/ ew(h ) @xmath42  are in excellent agreement with the model predictions for all objects .",
    "we conclude that all the given observational constraints can be reproduced by models with a salpeter imf extending to high masses for a burst scenario with star formation extending over @xmath1 410 myr .",
    "let us now address the question if this model is unique and what other models can be excluded .",
    "a variety of other models have been considered to explain the observations .",
    "we here consider mostly three variations , all of them adopting a large upper mass cut - off : _",
    "1 ) _ the effect of internal dust absorbing the ionizing photons , _ 2 ) _ variations of the star formation history , and _ 3 ) _ variations of the imf slope .    the first one is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the arrow indicates the direction along which the _ predicted _ lines will be shifted if 50 % of the lyman continuum photons are lost ( e.g.  absorbed by dust inside the h  ii  region ) .",
    "the figure shows that in this case the observations can still reasonably be explained with our `` standard model '' ; somewhat longer burst durations are then required .",
    "a distinction between the two cases from the remaining constraints including the sed is not possible .",
    "however , values of @xmath76 seem more difficult to reconcile with fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier instantaneous burst models are excluded from the observations due to the presence of both wr and rsg features , and the detailed sed .",
    "this also holds for synthesis models allowing for the formation of wr stars through roche lobe overflow in massive close binary systems ( cervio 1998 , cervio et al .",
    "2000 ) . at the epoch where such instantaneous burst models predict the simultaneous presence of wr ( formed in interacting systems ) and rsg ,",
    "the predicted h@xmath8  equivalent width is too low ( cervio , private communication )",
    ". constant star formation ( csf ) predicts a maximum @xmath22(wr)/@xmath22(h@xmath8 ) which is much too small ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , and too large h@xmath8  equivalent widths .",
    "the only way reconcile this scenario is to invoke effect 2 ) with variable values of @xmath63 as low as @xmath1 0.10.25 .",
    "the sed does not exclude this possibility .",
    "we have also performed monte - carlo simulations combining arbitrarily two `` standard imf '' instantaneous bursts of different ages and relative contributions .",
    "several possible combinations are found satisfying all the observational constraints ; all of them obviously involve a young ( @xmath5 5 myr ) population superposed to a older one ( @xmath6 79 myr ) producing enough evolved red stars .",
    "again , no strong distinction is found ( `` by eye '' ) for the seds compared to the extended burst scenario discussed above .",
    "finally we have considered the case of a steeper imf slope of @xmath77 , keeping m_up @xmath3=120 @xmath7 .",
    "this imf deficient in massive stars with respect to the salpeter slope produces just a strong enough wr bump ( up to @xmath784650 ) @xmath1 9 ( 13 )   for @xmath68=0.02 ( 0.04 ) ) at the maximum during an instantaneous burst .",
    "extended bursts are essentially excluded in this case , and very few solutions ( combined populations ) can be found .",
    "not enough massive stars ( wr stars with @xmath79 2025 @xmath7 ) are expected for this steep imf slope .    from the models considered in this section",
    "we conclude that a variety of models with a `` standard imf '' ( salpeter slope and large m_up @xmath3 ) reproduce the observational constraints .",
    "very few solutions can be found for an imf slope @xmath80 close to the miller & scalo ( 1979 ) value ; this renders such a steep imf in metal - rich regions very unlikely .",
    "before we proceed to a further discussion of the imf we shall briefly compare our successful models with those available by other authors for mkn 710 and mkn 1259 .",
    "the wr region in mkn 710 has recently been studied in detail by sck99 and mas - hesse & kunth ( 1999 ) .",
    "our results are in agreement with the study of sck99 , whose measurements have been included in the present paper ( see also sck99 for comparisons with the earlier data of vacca & conti 1992 ) .",
    "this region being the only metal - rich in the sample of sck99 , no detailed fitting attempt was made . regarding the imf ,",
    "sck99 conclude that the salpeter slope produces enough wr stars to explain the observations . from the analysis of 5 metal - poor regions sck99 found that short burst durations ( @xmath81 24 myr ) were required",
    "; mkn 710 was not considered .",
    "the somewhat longer burst durations found for the present metal - rich sample could be due to an increasing complexity of the regions considered here ( nuclear sb versus isolated h  ii  regions ) hosting progressively more separate populations .",
    "for the comparison with mas - hesse & kunth ( 1999 ) it is important to note that their optical ",
    "uv observations include a much larger region ( 10 by 20 ) than the present observations typically extracted over 23  wide regions .",
    "this explains most likely the larger contribution of an older underlying population contributing to the optical flux found by these authors .",
    "the results on the burst duration are in good agreement .",
    "incidentally mas - hesse & kunth derive the same stellar extinction as found from our work .    for mkn 1259",
    "a subsolar metallicity was derived by ohyama et al .",
    "( 1997 ) based on [ o iii ] @xmath155007 .",
    "the value used in the present work , based on a spectrum of superior s / n and resolution by git00 , should be more accurate . using their low metallicity value , ohyama et al .",
    "( 1997 ) concluded that an instantaneous burst with an age of @xmath1 5 myr reproduces well the observed properties of the nuclear region of this object .",
    "using our metallicity , the strengths of the wr features imply an extended burst , compatible with the observed rsg features and the sed . for most aspects however , the difference with ohyama et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is probably negligible .",
    "having excluded steep imf s with a high m_up @xmath3 , we will now examine what limits can be set up on m_up @xmath3  for a salpeter slope and discuss several implications from our results .",
    "we then briefly discuss the plausibility of the star formation timescales derived in this work .",
    "_ what value of m_up @xmath3  is our data exactly sensitive to ? _ from the ages and burst durations derived above we see that the _ youngest stars _ present have ages of the order of @xmath1 35 myr .",
    "this corresponds to stars with initial masses @xmath82 40120 @xmath7(see meynet et al .  1994 ) .",
    "although in the best case our data could be sensitive to changes of m_up @xmath3  over this range , we have to conservatively admit that we might not be able to distinguish between different values for the upper mass cut - off @xmath6 40 @xmath7 . to improve the present situation one obviously has to be able to study the intrinsically youngest regions and/or include additional observational constraints .    with the objects studied here",
    "it is not straightforward to answer the reverse question , namely _ `` what lower limit can we set on m_up @xmath3?''_. in the ideal case ( instantaneous burst with a known metallicity ) the use of wr lines is a very powerful discriminant , as illustrated in fig .",
    "8 . here , in principle ,",
    "the high metallicity tracks ( @xmath68=0.04 ) should be adopted to obtain a conservative lower limit for m_up @xmath3 . however , as it is clear from sect .  5 , the use of the wr features is not straightforward for answering the above question given the extended duration of sf . on the other hand , as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the observed h@xmath8  equivalent widths indicate clearly an upper mass cut - off of m_up @xmath3  @xmath2 30 @xmath7 .    the @xmath22(he  i @xmath155876)/@xmath22(h@xmath8 ) ratio has previously been used by bresolin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as an indicator of m_up @xmath3 .",
    "we note that for all of the data except mkn 309 our limit on m_up @xmath3  seems also consistent with the observed @xmath22(he  i @xmath155876)/@xmath22(h@xmath8 ) ratio as estimated from simple case b recombination theory .",
    "more firm conclusions await combined stellar population and photoionization modeling ( cf .",
    "sect .  7 ) .      assuming a salpeter imf with m_up @xmath3  as large as @xmath1 100120 @xmath7  at high metallicity , to be compatible with the observations discussed above , has obviously implications which need to be confronted with other observational data .",
    "a straightforward implication is that at age=0 h  ii  regions are expected to show very large h@xmath8  equivalent width ( @xmath1 450 500   for @xmath68=0.020.04 , and larger values for @xmath68 @xmath41 @xmath83 and m_up @xmath3=120 @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is well known that regions with such large ew(h ) @xmath42  are apparently not found or are extremely rare , independently of metallicity to first order .",
    "what is the situation for high metallicities ?",
    "relatively few ew(h ) @xmath42  measurements have been published for metal - rich h  ii  regions . among the data of shields",
    "et al .  ( 1991 ) , oey & kennicutt ( 1993 ) , kennicutt & garnett ( 1996 ) , van zee et al .  ( 1998 ) , and bresolin et al .",
    "( 1999 , see bresolin 1997 ) few regions with 12 + @xmath0(o / h )  @xmath6 8.9 have ew(h ) @xmath42  @xmath6 250  .",
    "furthermore these measurements are most likely affected by very large uncertainties due to placement of the weak continuum as inspection of some data of van zee et al .",
    "shows . from this data",
    "we conclude that max(ew(h ) @xmath42 ) @xmath1 200 - 300   for metal - rich h  ii  regions .",
    "for a salpeter slope this corresponds to m_up @xmath3  @xmath1 35  50 @xmath7 , compatible with our conservative lower limit for m_up @xmath3  but clearly below `` normal '' values of @xmath1 100120 @xmath7 .",
    "although a detailed discussion and interpretation of the observed  or h@xmath8  equivalent widths distributions is beyond the scope of the present work , we would like to briefly comment on four processes which could lead to reduced values of the observed ew(h ) @xmath42  maximum : _",
    "1 ) _ dust inside the h  ii  regions , _ 2 ) _ underlying populations diluting the continuum , _ 3 ) _ early phases hidden in compact radio sources ( cf .  kobulnicky & johnson 1999 ) , _ 4 ) _ absence of a proper zams for high mass stars in the accretion scenario of bernasconi & maeder ( 1996 ) . from the available data we are not able to discuss possible selection effects .",
    "the first two are the most commonly considered possibilities .",
    "the importance of dust , especially in metal - rich objects , remains to be explored . for metal - poor objects",
    "( e.g.  h  ii  galaxies ) with a low dust content the effect should on average be small .",
    "although for metal - poor objects the young bursts might dominate the visible light and underlying absorption ( 2 ) should thus not be important for the max(ew(h ) @xmath42)-discrepancy ( cf .  mas - hesse & kunth 1999 ) , the recent study of raimann et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggests the existence of non - negligible underlying populations . if the bulk of star formation ( sf ) occurred in a similar fashion as in he 2 - 10 , where kobulnicky & johnson ( 1999 ) find a significant number of compact radio sources , this could constitute a possibility to hide the earliest phases of sf and thereby reducing the observed maximum ew(h ) @xmath42 .",
    "we note , however , that the estimated lifetime of these regions ( @xmath1 10 % of the o star lifetime ; kobulnicky & johnson ) is clearly too short to resolve the max(ew(h ) @xmath42)-discrepancy which concerns the first @xmath1 2 myr .",
    "effect 4 has been suggested by mas - hesse & kunth ( 1999 ) as a possibility to explain this discrepancy .",
    "however , test calculations ( schaerer & bernasconi , 1995 , unpublished ) show that the stellar tracks following the accretion scenario of bernasconi & maeder ( 1996 ) lead to an insufficient decrease of max(ew(h ) @xmath42 ) ) @xmath1 400   for @xmath68=0.02 and the standard imf . ] .",
    "in addition , the validity of their scenario remains to be verified by detailed confrontations with observations of individual stars .",
    "regarding only metal - rich region we conclude from the available ew(h ) @xmath42  data that the observed maximum h@xmath8  equivalent width is compatible with a salpeter imf with an upper mass cut - off m_up @xmath3  @xmath1 35  50 @xmath7 , in agreement with the results from our wr galaxies .",
    "larger values of m_up @xmath3  can not be excluded from our present ( small ) sample of objects , in contrast to the indications from ew(h ) @xmath42  measurements in larger samples . in view of the discrepancy between the",
    "observed and predicted max(ew(h ) @xmath42 ) which seems to hold _ for all metallicities _ and for which currently no clear explanation exists , interpretations based on the `` exclusive '' use of ew(h ) @xmath42  should , however , be taken with caution .",
    "an interesting result derived from our models is that all the objects analysed here require extended burst durations over @xmath1 410 myr or a superposition of two or more bursts with similar ages differences and a young component ( @xmath5 5 myr ) .",

    "is there any difference of increasing burst duration with distance as could be expected on average if the observed regions are composed of an increasing number of `` small '' super star cluster like objects ? in this context it is interesting to note that in an earlier study of wr galaxies with distances of 414 mpc burst durations not exceeding @xmath1 24 myr were found using the same evolutionary synthesis models ( sck99 ) .",
    "this difference is likely due to two effects : first the distance effect , and second the different nature of the objects included in the two samples ( dwarf galaxies with one or few sf regions versus predominantly nuclear starbursts ) .",
    "we have obtained new spectroscopic observation of mkn 309 , a starburst galaxy with one of the largest wr population known ( cf .",
    "osterbrock & cohen 1982 , armus et al .  1988 ) .",

    "the mkn 309 observations have been combined with spectra of four other metal - rich wr galaxies from the sample of guseva et al .  ( 2000 ) to constrain the basic properties of the massive star populations ( imf slope , m_up @xmath3 ) and the star formation history ( age , burst duration ) of these objects by detailed quantitative comparisons with appropriate evolutionary synthesis models ( sect .  5 ) .",
    "we have used the following main observational constraints : h recombination lines , intensities and equivalent widths of the main wr features , tio bands originating from a population of late type stars ( which are most likely red supergiants ; cf .",

    "this naturally explains both the observed wr populations ( including wn and wc stars ) and the presence of red supergiants .",
    "such extended burst durations , compared to other wr galaxies indicating even shorter sf timescales ( e.g.  sck99 ) , are plausible in view of the physical sizes of the observed regions and the nature and morphology of our objects ( nuclear starbursts ) , and pose no fundamental physical problem ( sect .",

    "<S> we present new spectroscopic observations of mkn 309 , a starburst galaxy with one of the largest wr populations known . </S>",
    "<S> a highly super solar metallicity of 12 + @xmath0(o / h )  @xmath1 9.39.4 is derived . using additional objects from guseva et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2000 ) we analyse a sample of five metal - rich ( [ o / h ] @xmath2 0 ) wr galaxies with the main goal of constraining the basic properties of the massive star populations ( imf slope , m_up @xmath3 ) and the star formation history ( age , burst duration ) of these objects by quantitative comparisons with evolutionary synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> the following main results are obtained :    * the observations are well explained by extended bursts of star formation with durations @xmath4 410 myr seen at ages of 715 myr or a superposition of several bursts with age differences of @xmath1 410 myr including a young ( @xmath5 5 myr ) burst . </S>",
    "<S> this naturally explains both the observed wr populations ( including wn and wc stars ) and the presence of red supergiants . </S>",
    "<S> the burst durations , somewhat longer compared to those derived in other wr galaxies using the same models ( schaerer et al .  </S>",
    "<S> 1999a ) , are plausible in view of the physical sizes of the observed regions and the nature and morphology of our objects ( nuclear starbursts ) , and pose no fundamental physical problem . </S>",
    "<S> * the seds in the optical range are very well reproduced for all objects , provided the stellar light suffers from a smaller extinction than that of the gas ( derived from the balmer decrement ) . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms earlier findings from studies combining uv  optical data of other starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> * all the considered observational constraints are compatible with a salpeter imf extending to masses m_up @xmath3  @xmath6 40 @xmath7 . adopting a conservative approach </S>",
    "<S> we derive a _ </S>",
    "<S> lower limit _ of m_up @xmath3@xmath6 30 @xmath7  for the salpeter imf . from more realistic assumptions on the metallicity and sf history </S>",
    "<S> we favour a lower limit m_up @xmath3@xmath6 3040 @xmath7 , which is also in agreement with h@xmath8  equivalent width measurements of metal - rich h  ii  regions in spiral galaxies indicating an upper mass cut - off of at least @xmath1 35  50 @xmath7 . steep imf slopes ( @xmath9 ) </S>",
    "<S> are very unlikely .    </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties of our results are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our findings to other work on massive star populations and the imf in similar environments . </S>",
    "<S> we stress the importance of direct analysis of stellar populations compared to other indirect methods based on properties of ionized gas to constrain the imf in metal - rich starbursts . </S>"
