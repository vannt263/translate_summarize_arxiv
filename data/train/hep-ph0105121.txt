    "high energy electron - proton scattering at the desy @xmath2 collider hera is dominated by photoproduction processes , where the electron is scattered at small angles , emitting a quasireal photon which scatters with the proton .",
    "these processes are of special interest since they are sensitive to both the partonic structure of the photon as well as of the proton .",
    "in particular , they offer the possibility to constrain the ( presently poorly known ) gluon distributions in the photon , since in a certain kinematical region the subprocess @xmath3 , where the gluon is stemming from a resolved photon , is dominating . up to now , the experimental errors were too large to discriminate clearly between different sets of gluon distributions in the photon , but a high statistics analysis of the 1996 - 2000 hera data on prompt photon photoproduction announced by the zeus collaboration will shed new light on this issue .",
    "the calculation of higher order corrections to the compton process @xmath4 has been initiated some time ago  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the most recent calculations for prompt photon photoproduction have been done by gordon / vogelsang@xcite for isolated prompt photon production , gordon  @xcite for photon plus jet production and by the group krawczyk / zembrzuski  @xcite for both the inclusive case and @xmath5+jet .",
    "however , all of these calculations contain certain drawbacks . in  @xcite",
    ", isolation is implemented by adding a subtraction term evaluated in the collinear approximation to the fully inclusive cross section .",
    "the programs of @xcite and @xcite do not contain the full set of nlo corrections . in @xcite",
    ", those parts where the final state photon comes from fragmentation of a hard parton were included only at leading order , arguing that isolation cuts will suppress the fragmentation component in any case to a large extent .",
    "moreover , the box contribution has not been included . in @xcite , higher order corrections are included only for the case where initial and final state photons are both direct .",
    "so not only the contributions from fragmentation , but also the case where the initial photon is resolved are included at born level only .",
    "however , the box contribution has been taken into account .",
    "the calculation presented in this paper takes into account the full nlo corrections to all four subparts .",
    "the corresponding matrix elements already have been calculated and tested in previous works  @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of the present code is also given by the fact that it is constructed as a `` partonic event generator '' and as such is very flexible .",
    "various sorts of observables matching a particular experimental analysis can be defined and histogrammed for an event sample generated once and for all .",
    "this strategy already has been applied to construct nlo codes for @xmath6 production ( diphox )  @xcite and one or two jets photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we first describe the theoretical framework and the treatment of the infrared singularities .",
    "then we discuss the implementation of isolation cuts and outline the structure of the code .",
    "section 3 is devoted to phenomenology .",
    "we study the effect of isolation , determine the kinematic region which is most sensitive to the gluon distribution in the photon and illustrate the sensitivity of the cross section to the energy of the incoming photon .",
    "we give results for inclusive isolated prompt photon production and compare with a recent analysis of zeus data  @xcite , before we come to the conclusions in section 4 .",
    "in this section the general framework for prompt photon photoproduction will be outlined .",
    "we will review the contributing subprocesses , the treatment of infrared singularities and the implementation of isolation cuts .",
    "the inclusive cross section for @xmath7 can symbolically be written as a convolution of the parton densities of the incident particles ( resp .",
    "fragmentation function for an outgoing parton fragmenting into a photon ) with the partonic cross section @xmath8    @xmath9    where @xmath10 are the initial state factorization scales , @xmath11 the final state factorization scale and @xmath12 the renormalization scale .",

    "these singularities are factorized to all orders in @xmath28 and absorbed , at some arbitrary fragmentation scale @xmath11 , into quark and gluon fragmentation functions to a photon , @xmath29 .",

    "note that the singularity appearing in the process @xmath32 when the final state photon is emitted by the quark and becomes collinear , is subtracted and absorbed by the fragmentation function at the scale @xmath11 , as explained above .",

    "one can see that the nlo cross section is much more stable against scale variations , it varies by less than 10% in this @xmath12 range .",
    "there are basically two methods to isolate the infrared singularities appearing in the calculation at nlo : the phase space slicing method  @xcite and the subtraction method  @xcite .",

    "the phase space is cut into two regions :    * part i where the norm @xmath41 of the transverse momentum of particle 5 is required to be less than some arbitrary value @xmath42 taken to be small compared to the other transverse momenta .",
    "this cylinder contains the infrared and the initial state collinear singularities .",

    "this slice yields no divergence , and can thus be treated directly in @xmath50 dimensions .    the contributions from regions i and iia , b are calculated analytically in @xmath51 dimensions and then combined with the corresponding virtual corrections such that the infrared singularities cancel , except for the initial ( resp .",
    "final ) state collinear singularities , which are factorized and absorbed into the parton distribution ( resp .",
    "fragmentation ) functions .",
    "after the cancellation , the finite remainders of the soft and collinear contributions in parts i and iia , b , c separately depend on large logarithms @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "when combining the different parts , the following cancellations of the @xmath42 and @xmath46 dependences occur : + in part i , the finite terms are approximated by collecting all the terms depending logarithmically on @xmath42 and neglecting the terms proportional to powers of @xmath42 . on the contrary , the @xmath46 dependence in the conical parts iia and iib , is kept exactly .",
    "this means that an exact cancellation of the dependence on the unphysical parameter @xmath46 between part iic and parts iia , b occurs , whereas the cancellation of the unphysical parameter @xmath42 between parts iic , iia , b and part i is only approximate .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 must be chosen small enough with respect to @xmath54 in order that the neglected terms can be safely dropped out .",
    "on the other hand , it can not be chosen too small since otherwise numerical instabilities occur .",
    "we have investigated the stability of the cross section by varying @xmath42 and @xmath46 between @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( see figure [ varyptm ] ) and accordingly chosen the optimal values @xmath57gev , @xmath58 .      in order to single out the prompt photon events from the huge background of secondary photons produced by the decays of @xmath59 mesons , isolation cuts have to be imposed on the photon signals in the experiment .",
    "a commonly used isolation criterion is the following : a photon is isolated if , inside a cone centered around the photon direction in the rapidity and azimuthal angle plane , the amount of hadronic transverse energy @xmath60 deposited is smaller than some value @xmath61 fixed by the experiment : @xmath62 following the conventions of the zeus collaboration , we used @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 = 1 .",
    "isolation not only reduces the background from secondary photons , but also substantially reduces the fragmentation components , as will be illustrated in section [ incl ] .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note that the isolation parameters must be carefully fixed in order to allow a comparison between data and perturbative qcd calculations . indeed",
    "a part of the hadronic energy measured in the cone may come from the underlying event ; therefore even the direct contribution can be cut by the isolation condition if the latter is too stringent .",
    "let us estimate the importance of this effect and assume that the underlying event one - particle inclusive distribution is given by @xmath66 @xmath67 being normalized to @xmath68 particles per unit of rapidity .",
    "the probability that the isolation condition is fulfilled by a particle from an underlying event is @xmath69 with the zeus isolation parameters , @xmath70gev for a photon of @xmath71gev .",
    "using @xmath72 and @xmath73gev extracted from @xcite , one obtains @xmath74 this estimation is very rough and underestimates the true effect because there is also a non - negligible probability to fulfill the isolation condition with two underlying particles falling into the cone . only a detailed monte carlo description of the underlying events",
    "can allow a reliable estimate of this non - perturbative effect .",
    "here we just note that the cut put by zeus ( @xmath75gev ) is likely to be too low to eliminate any underlying event contamination and therefore makes a comparison between the partonic level qcd predictions and the ( hadronic level ) data difficult .",
    "the code consists of four subparts corresponding to each of the four categories of subprocesses . for each category , the functions corresponding to the parts i , iia , b , c described in section [ ir ] are integrated separately with the numerical integration package bases@xcite .",
    "based on the grid produced by this integration , partonic events are generated with spring@xcite and stored into an ntuple or histogrammed directly .",
    "it has to be emphasized that we generate final state _ partonic _ configurations .",
    "hence this type of program does not provide an exclusive portrait of final states as given by hadronic event generators like pythia or herwig . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter are only of some improved leading logarithmic accuracy .",
    "the information stored in the ntuple are the 4-momenta of the outgoing particles , their types ( i.e. quark , gluon or photon ) , the energy of the incident photon and , in the fragmentation cases , the longitudinal fragmentation variable associated with the photon from fragmentation .",
    "furthermore a label is stored that allows to identify the origin of the event , e.g. if it comes from a @xmath76 or a @xmath77 process .",
    "based on the information contained in these ntuples , suitable observables can be defined and different jet algorithms can be studied .",
    "the isolation cuts are included already at the integration level , but the user of the program can turn isolation on or off and vary the input parameters for the isolation cut at will .",
    "in this section we present some numerical results for isolated prompt photon production . we restrict ourselves to the inclusive case , photon + jet production will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming publication .    for the parton distributions in the proton",
    "we take the mrst2  @xcite parametrization .",
    "our default choice for the photon distribution functions is afg  @xcite , for comparisons we also used the grv  @xcite distributions transformed to the @xmath78 scheme . for the fragmentation functions we use the parametrization of bourhis et al  @xcite .",

    "these corrections are assumed to be uniform over the whole @xmath91 range and enter into the experimental systematic error .",
    "however , as the background varies with the photon energy @xmath91 , these corrections may not be uniform .",

    "it should be emphasized that figure  [ isononiso ] has to be read with care since the individual parts have no physical meaning and are very sensitive to scale changes .",
    "nevertheless the dominance of the resolved direct part remains if we choose e.g. @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "figure [ resovsdir ] shows the relative magnitude of contributions from resolved and direct photons in the initial state to the isolated cross section . from the @xmath100 distribution",
    "one can conclude that the resolved part dominates the cross section for small values of @xmath100 such that it would be useful to look at the photon rapidity distribution at @xmath71gev in order to discriminate between different parton distribution functions in the photon .",

    "we conclude that in the region @xmath105 , there is basically no sensitivity to the gluon in the photon .",
    "however , investigating the photon + jet cross section instead of the inclusive case offers larger possibilities to constrain the gluon in the photon since there one can vary the photon _ and _ the jet rapidities in order to single out a kinematic region where the sensitivity is large  @xcite .",
    "figure [ varyeta ] shows the effect of a ten percent uncertainty in the `` true '' bounds of the photon energy @xmath91 .",
    "one can see that a change of the lower bound on @xmath91 has a large effect , in particular at large photon rapidities .",
    "this comes from the fact that the weizscker - williams distribution is large and steeply falling at small @xmath91 . increasing the lower bound on @xmath91",

    "( @xmath106 for the direct events and large @xmath93 correspond to small @xmath107 . ) at large photon rapidities the spread due to the use of different parton distribution functions for the photon is smaller than the one caused by a 10% variation of the lower bound on @xmath91 . on the other hand ,",
    "the region of large photon rapidities is of special interest since there the gluon in the photon is dominating .",
    "therefore a small experimental error in the reconstruction of the `` true '' photon energy is crucial in order to be able to discriminate between different sets of parton distribution functions in the photon .",

    "the curves of gordon  @xcite and krawczyk / zembrzuski  @xcite given in  @xcite also show this trend . at high @xmath93 the reason for the difference could be that the isolation cut in the experiment removes more events than in the theoretical ( parton level ) simulation , as discussed in section  [ iso ] .",
    "figure  [ sliceeta ] shows that the discrepancy between theory and data at low @xmath93 comes mainly from the domain of small photon energies , whereas the discrepancy at large @xmath93 is only present in the range of large photon energies .",
    "note that at large @xmath93 and large @xmath91 the resolved part dominates and the underlying event could have a large multiplicity .",
    "therefore the isolation criterion could also cut on the non - fragmentation contributions as discussed in section  [ iso ] .",
    "we have presented a program for prompt photon photoproduction which includes the full next - to - leading order corrections to all contributing subparts .",
    "it is a general purpose code of partonic event generator type and as such very flexible .",
    "we used it to study the possibility to constrain the quark and gluon distributions in the photon .",
    "it turned out that the sensitivity to the _ gluon _ distribution in the photon is negligible in the rapidity range @xmath108 studied by zeus .",
    "a discrimination between the afg / grv sets of parton distributions in the photon is not possible with the present experimental errors on the zeus 1996/97 data .",
    "however , a forthcoming analysis of all 1996 - 2000 data announced by the zeus collaboration will drastically improve this situation .",
    "we have shown that the cross section is very sensitive to small variations of the photon energy range .",
    "therefore a good control of the experimental error on the photon energy fraction @xmath91 ( reconstructed experimentally from the jacquet - blondel variable @xmath92 ) will be crucial for future comparisons . despite the large fluctuations of the data",
    ", one can say that there is a trend that theory overpredicts the data in the forward region .",
    "the reason might be that the isolation cut imposed at partonic level in the perturbative qcd calculation does not have the same effect as the experimental one .",
    "if the experimental cut is too stringent , a large fraction of the hadronic energy in the isolation cone may come from underlying events , such that experimentally a larger number of events is rejected .",
