    "in recent years , considerable attention of the controlled fusion community has been paid to spherical tokamaks ( st ) .",
    "these are small aspect ratio devices with typically high plasma density and comparatively low magnetic field .",
    "this st feature has strong effect on the electromagnetic wave propagation . in the microwave frequency region ,",
    "characteristic surfaces , like the upper hybrid resonance and the cut - off are very close to the plasma edge . as a result , the electromagnetic ( em )",
    "waves are unable to penetrate into the plasma interior . the only way to overcome this difficulty is to use the linear conversion of the incident em wave into the electron bernstein wave ( ebw ) occurring in the upper hybrid resonance ( uhr ) .",
    "the latter has no density limitations and can , in principle , carry the radio frequency power deep into the plasma .",
    "this mechanism of wave conversion has been successfully demonstrated to produce heating in over dense plasmas in the w7-as stellarator  @xcite .",
    "the plasma heating experiment based on this scheme is in progress now in the mast tokamak at culham , uk .",
    "the wave propagation , conversion in the uhr and absorption is usually accompanied , in 100  kw power level experiments , by nonlinear effects , in particular , by parametric decay instabilities ( versator  @xcite ,  @xcite , w7-as  @xcite ) .",
    "these instabilities lead to redistribution of incident power between plasma species and can cause anomalous reflection , especially when excited at the plasma edge .",
    "the present paper is devoted to analysis of the decay instability thresholds and growth rates for specific conditions of low magnetic field typical for st .",
    "the study is focused upon the decay of uh wave into another uh wave and intermediate frequency range wave satisfying the lower hybrid resonance condition , which was observed in the uhr heating experiments mentioned above .",
    "the influence of plasma inhomogeneity on its threshold is investigated for backscattering of the incident uh wave .",
    "dependence of the decay instability threshold on the pump frequency , necessary for the heating experiment optimization , is studied .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we deduce equations , describing the decay of the incident high - frequency uh wave into uh wave and low - frequency lh wave : @xmath2 , and consider them in wkb approximation . in",
    "we calculate an absolute instability threshold , which corresponds to uh wave induced back scattering instability .",

    "uh pump wave is supposed to be excited by external antenna via tunnelling effect ( x@xmath5b scheme according to  @xcite ) , and assumed to propagate in @xmath3 direction .",
    "we consider here the high pump frequency case , when the frequency is larger than doubled electron cyclotron frequency , corresponding to the magnetic field in uhr : @xmath6 . in this case",
