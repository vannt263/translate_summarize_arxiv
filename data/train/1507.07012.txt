    "@xcite detected a moving diffuse object , the so - called g2 cloud , on its way towards sgr a * , the radio source identified as the central massive black hole of our galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the tidal disruption of this cloud is being monitored by different groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and provides a unique opportunity to test accretion physics , due to both its proximity and the timescale on which it happens . @xcite estimated the mass of g2 to be @xmath7 from its line emission .",
    "however , the nature of g2 has not been clarified yet .",
    "in particular , there is an ongoing debate on whether the diffuse cloud contains a compact mass ( likely a star ) .",
    "@xcite presented the detection of a compact source at 3.8 @xmath8 m ( thermal dust emission ) that would correspond to g2 during pericentre passage .",
    "its survival as a compact source to the close passage ( @xmath9schwarzchild radii ) suggests the existence of a central star keeping it bound , which they argue is a binary merger product @xcite.other possible explanations for a central mass in g2 include an evaporating proto - planetary disc or the wind of a t - tauri star @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite argued in favour of a purely gaseous cloud nature for g2 using their brackett-@xmath10 observations .",
    "they interpreted this source as a bright knot of a larger gas streamer that includes a g2-type object called g1 in a similar orbit , but preceding it by 13 yr .",
    "g1 and g2 could be explained as the result of the partial tidal disruption of a star @xcite or as one of many gas clumps created by the collision of stellar winds from the young stars in the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "such dense , cold clumps are copiously produced in the smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( hereafter sph ) simulations of the galactic centre gas dynamics performed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ",
    "3.3 ) , and could survive pericentre passage if magnetised @xcite .",
    "moreover , g2 s orbit lies on the plane of the ` clockwise disc ' , defined by the orbits of many young stars @xcite , and its apocentre coincides with the inner rim of that disc .",
    "nevertheless , the sph technique has a tendency for artificially clumping gas @xcite , which raises doubts on how physical the clump formation is in such models . in this context",
    ", this work aims to test independently the clump formation as result of colliding stellar winds in the central parsec of the milky way .",
    "massive stars have significant phases of mass loss through their lives , in which their outflows can be accelerated up to supersonic speeds due to radiation pressure .",
    "when two of these stars are at short separations , for example in a binary system , their winds collide and generate a hot slab of shocked gas . depending on the ability of this gas to cool down , we can identify different regimes . if the shocked gas from both stellar winds cool down rapidly , a cold thin shell will be produced centred at the contact discontinuity ( hereafter cd ) of the wind - wind interaction zone .",
    "this slab will be subject to strong instabilities such as the _ non - linear thin shell instability _",
    "( hereafter ntsi , * ? ? ? * ) . in the case that only one of the winds is highly radiative , a cold thin shell will also be formed ; but if instabilities are excited they will be damped by the thermal pressure of the hot shocked gas from the other wind @xcite .",
    "when none of the winds are radiative , the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( hereafter khi ) is the only instability that can be excited @xcite , as it only requires a velocity difference between the winds .",
    "however , khi can also act on top of thin - shell instabilities for radiatively efficient winds .",
    "state - of - the - art numerical modelling @xcite highlights the high computational cost of realistic simulations of unstable colliding wind systems .",
    "high spatial and time resolution , plus many physical ingredients , such as gravity , driving of the winds , radiative cooling and orbital motion , are crucial to build realistic models and track the growth of instabilities .",
    "in this context , we take an alternative analytical approach and study the thermal evolution of the hot slab created by the colliding winds .",
    "this allows us to predict under which conditions , out of a wide parameter space , the ntsi grows ; and to estimate the possible resulting clump masses .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : section  [ sec : cooling ] describes the main cooling diagnostic we use throughout this work and section  [ sec : clumps ] presents our model and the results of our parameter space study . in section  [ sec : colliding ] we discuss how likely the formation of the g2 cloud is through colliding winds based on our results .",
    "then in section  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the limitations of our results and argue for colliding winds binaries as clump sources in the galactic centre .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions and outlook .",
    "the role of radiative cooling is what determines the thickness , density and temperature of the shocked gas layer .",
    "if cooling is efficient , the wind collision will produce a dense , thin layer of cold gas , which can easily be subject to the so - called _ thin shell instabilities_. in their numerical models , @xcite identified two such instabilities : the ntsi , later explained analytically by @xcite , and another damped instability consistent with the earlier description by @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite described another thin shell instability : the _ transverse acceleration instability _",
    "( tai ) that mainly takes place off the two - star axis .",
    "@xcite , modelling unstable colliding winds systems numerically , concluded that the ntsi is the instability that dominates the cold slab evolution due to its large scale perturbations .    in order to predict whether the wind collision will produce a thin slab we need to check",
    "how fast the shocked gas cools down . following the description presented in @xcite , the radiative efficiency of shocked stellar winds can be described by the _ cooling parameter _",
    "@xmath11 , which is the ratio of the cooling timescale to the dynamical timescale , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the cooling and the dynamical timescales , respectively .",
    "they are defined as , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the temperature and number density of the shocked gas , respectively , @xmath18 is the cooling function which we will specify in the following section , @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath20 is the distance between the star and the cd and @xmath21 is the shocked gas sound speed .",
    "therefore , for @xmath11 lower than unity , the gas can cool down faster through radiative cooling than through adiabatic expansion . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath11 larger than one means that radiative cooling is not efficient . following @xcite , but using a cooling function that depends on metal abundance ( specified in section  [ sec : an ] ) and temperature rather than being constant ( see equation  [ eq : dis ] )",
    "we can calculate the cooling parameter for each stellar wind given its properties , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the terminal wind speed @xmath24 in units of 1000  km  s@xmath2 , @xmath25 is the distance between the star and the cd @xmath20 in units of @xmath26  cm and @xmath27 is the mass loss rate @xmath28 in units of 10@xmath29 @xmath4  yr@xmath2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : chi ] , we show @xmath11 as a function of @xmath24 and the stellar separation of identical stars @xmath30 for @xmath31 @xmath32yr@xmath2 fixed , which is the typical value for the wolf - rayet stars in the galactic centre ( see   [ sec : colliding ] ) .",
    "we have highlighted the boundary @xmath33 to separate the two cooling regimes .",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath34 region , which is where the ntsi excitation is possible .     and fixing the mass loss rate to 10@xmath35 @xmath4 yr@xmath2 .",
    "it is shown as a function of the stellar separation @xmath36 ( for identical stars ) on the x - axis and the stellar wind velocity @xmath24 on the y - axis .",
    "the solid line shows @xmath37 which separates the two regimes : adiabatic ( above , @xmath38 ) and roughly isothermal ( below , @xmath39 ) winds . dashed and",
    "dotted lines show the @xmath37 boundaries for mass loss rates of 10@xmath40 and 10@xmath41 @xmath4 yr@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "green stars labelled a  h indicate the parameters of models we study in more detail in   [ sec : clumps ] .",
    "notice that @xmath42 au.,scaledwidth=52.5% ]",
    "as discussed in the previous section , if the slab gas can cool down rapidly , different thin shell instabilities can be excited .",
    "the dominant instability is the ntsi , which is the result of the misalignment of the thermal pressure within the cold slab ( which always acts perpendicular to the slab ) and the ram pressure of the wind ( always acting parallel to the wind direction ) .",
    "this generates a convergent flux onto perturbation knots where gas accumulates , and a subsequent mixing of both phases of the material . in this section",
    "we use the description of @xcite to calculate the allowed wavelength range of the ntsi which can grow .",
    "the growth of the ntsi can occur only for wavelengths shorter than those coordinated by sound waves : @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , the shortest unstable wavelength is given by the slab thickness @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the ntsi can grow only if the slab perturbation has an initial amplitude at least comparable to the thickness of the layer .",
    "notice that the criteria depend on the time @xmath46 elapsed since the formation of the slab .",
    "the thickness of the slab generated by isothermal flows is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the velocity at which the slab thickens , @xmath49 is the mach number , and @xmath50 is the shock speed . notice that for the limit of high mach number @xmath51 , and that the more supersonic the shock , the slower the slab increases its width .",
    "in our model we consider two identical stars that are fixed in space .",
    "they have a given mass loss rate and wind terminal velocity , and are separated by a given distance . respectively , these three quantities @xmath28 , @xmath24 and @xmath36 , are the input parameters of the model .",
    "we follow the time evolution of the gas within the slab formed when the winds collide by studying its integrated density and thermal evolution , including a radiative cooling term .",
    "we define the relevant densities as , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the volumetric density inside the slab , @xmath54 is the surface density of the slab and @xmath55 is the width of the slab .",
    "all these quantities evolve and we study them as a function of their age , i.e. , the time after the wind collision . as we are studying a symmetric system ( identical stars with identical winds ) , we model one side of the system",
    ". therefore , @xmath56 will be the distance from the cd to the discontinuity of the shocked and the free wind region . as the slab is supported by thermal pressure , in this point the thermal and the wind ram pressure have to be balanced , which is a reasonable assumption considering that",
    "the thermal energy is negligible in the free - wind region that is highly supersonic ( @xmath57 ) . from this model ,",
    "we can write the hydrodynamical equations as follows , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the pressure in the slab , @xmath8 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath60 is the proton mass , @xmath61 is the mechanical heating term ( i.e. kinetic energy flux from the wind per unit surface ) , and @xmath62 is the energy dissipation term through radiative cooling .",
    "these source terms are given by @xmath63 where the cooling function @xmath18 is an analytical approximation for optically thin radiative cooling made by @xcite following @xcite , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the metal abundance relative to solar .",
    "we set @xmath66 and discuss the impact of this choice in section  [ sec : limit ] . combining the system of equations  [ eq : sys1 ] ,  [ eq : sys2 ] ,  [ eq : sys3 ] ,  [ eq : sys4 ] ,  [ eq : sys5 ] ; and assuming an ideal gas @xmath67 , we can derive a single differential equation that describes the thermal evolution of the slab : @xmath68 the first term on the right hand side represents the mechanical heating of the shock ; the second , the radiative cooling ; and the third , the work done by the slab .",
    "furthermore , the slab density can be easily computed making use of equation  [ eq : sys2 ] and the ideal gas equation of state .",
    "thus , the slab width time evolution can be calculated using equations  [ eq : sys0 ] and  [ eq : sys1 ] to obtain @xmath69=\\rho_{\\rm wind}v \\rightarrow   l(t)=\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm wind}}{\\rho_{\\rm slab}(t)}vt.\\ ] ] from this expression we note that if the slab does not cool down ( i.e. the slab density remains roughly constant ) , the slab will increase its width linearly with time ; on the contrary , if the slab gets denser very rapidly it may overcome the linearity dependence with time and collapse as a thin shell which grows very slowly due to the fact that @xmath70 .",

    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]      for simplicity , we have only analysed collisions of identical stellar winds .",
    "however , in reality we will typically have encounters between stars with different wind properties . to study such cases ,",
    "detailed numerical simulations are needed , such as those performed by @xcite .",
    "these authors have shown that even a small velocity difference in the colliding winds can excite the khi .",
    "this would mix two - phase material on top of other instabilities that can take place simultaneously .",
    "although all these processes can be very complicated to track analytically , based on our work we can give a qualitative description of possible scenarios that can take place for asymmetric close encounters .",
    "stellar wind encounters are characterised by their momentum flux ratio @xcite , @xmath71 where the subscript @xmath72 stands for the weaker wind and @xmath73 for the stronger one , so @xmath74 by definition .",
    "notice that @xmath75 is independent of the stellar separation , provided this is large enough to allow the winds to reach their terminal velocities . for @xmath76 , the interaction zone of the shocked gas bends towards the weaker star .",
    "the cd distance to the weaker wind star will be given by @xmath77 then , the cd will be located closer to the weaker star for systems with smaller @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , the weaker wind will be less diluted before the collision producing a denser slab ( compared to systems with same @xmath75 but different stellar separation ) . in this way",
    ", stars with large momentum fluxes in their winds can be important in asymmetric encounters as they could  force \" weaker winds to radiate their energy rapidly , which would result in radiative shocks . in figure",
    "[ fig : diag ] , we highlighted the stars with largest momentum fluxes in their winds , including their names on the plot .",
    "encounters of these stars with others , of the left side of the plot , will produce encounters with small @xmath75 and short distances @xmath78 from the weaker star to the cd .",
    "for each of the encounters we registered in the previous subsection , we calculated the momentum flux ratio and the @xmath78 value .",
    "we can now modify the definition of the cooling parameter ( equation  [ eq : chi ] ) , so it uses the distance @xmath78 at which the cd is expected to form in the asymmetric close encounters , @xmath79 where @xmath80 cm . since @xmath78 is always a fraction of @xmath81 , the density of the weaker wind will be higher at that position compared to the symmetric case and the slab will be able to radiate its energy away more rapidly . all these estimates are included in table  [ tab : encon ] . from those results we can check that for two of our models ( _ 1disc _ and _ min - ecc _ ) there is only one encounter where the weaker wind produces a cold slab that might become unstable , while in the other case ( _ 2discs _ ) , there are four such encounters .",
    "the difference is at least partially due to the fact that in the _",
    "2discs _ case the stars are closer together and more encounters are produced in general .",
    "these systems deserve more study because they could be clump sources .",
    "it is important to remark that , in the asymmetric case , on one side of the cd we have a thin shell while on the other we have the hot shocked gas of the stronger wind .",
    "the latter tends to stabilise any instability possibly excited , so even if @xmath82 there might be no clump formation . also notice that all these estimates were done under the assumption that the stars are separated well enough in order to accelerate their winds up to their terminal velocities .",
    "however , for extreme values of @xmath75 that might not be the case .",
    "although our model has been very useful to test the likelihood of clump formation in stellar wind shocked gas , there are two important assumptions we have to consider before comparing with other works , specially with 2- or 3-dimensional models .",
    "our model considers planar shocks , rather than more realistic spherical wind collisions . a planar shock geometry is a good approximation for the wind collision at the apex ( i.e. , at the cd and two - star axis intersection ) , where the gas effectively moves along the axis joining both stars . off this axis",
    ", the winds will have a perpendicular velocity component , and the planar approximation breaks down .",
    "moreover , the off - axis velocity will prevent the material from accumulating in the slab . nevertheless , the well - modelled apex is arguably the most interesting location of the wind collision for us , as this is where we expect the most massive clumps to form .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mass - range ] , as long as we stay in the radiatively - efficient regime , higher values of @xmath11 generate more massive clumps .",
    "so far , we have defined @xmath11 using the wind speed and the distance between the stars , which is only appropriate along the two - stars axis . in a more realistic model , @xmath11 changes along the cd , decreasing from the apex as we show below .",
    "let us define a more general cooling parameter as @xmath11  =  @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the angle between the two - star axis and a line connecting one star and an arbitrary point @xmath85 on the cd .",
    "the distance from the star to @xmath85 will be given by @xmath86  =  @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , the shock at @xmath85 will be weaker than at the apex , as only the component perpendicular to the cd will contribute to it . this component will be given by @xmath88 .",
    "using these quantities we can generalise equation  [ eq : chi ] obtaining @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the cooling parameter at the apex , as previously defined in equation  [ eq : chi ] . from this new expression",
    "we see that in general , @xmath91 , recovering equation  [ eq : chi ] when @xmath92 as expected .",
    "thus , away from the apex the cooling parameter decreases , and according to our results , we expect the creation of less massive clumps . with this in mind , the clump masses we quote are the largest we can expect from a given wind collision and they would form near the apex where the planar - wind assumption is accurate .",
    "different metallicities result in different cooling timescales , which in turn modify the sizes and masses of the clumps . as there is no agreement on the metallicity measurements for the massive stars in the galactic centre ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we have set @xmath93 , following @xcite and close to the values @xcite studied .",
    "however , in order to quantify the sensitivity to our choice , we also produced models with metallicities of @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the analytical cooling function we use ( see equation  [ eq : dis ] ) .",
    "we found changes of a factor @xmath96 in the clump sizes , which translate in a factor @xmath97 for the clump masses . as expected , a lower metallicity value increases the cooling timescale , and viceversa .",
    "nevertheless , these changes in the metallicity do not result in switching the wind regimes for the system we have analysed ( e.g. , from radiative to adiabatic or in the opposite direction ) as the impact on the cooling parameter is not very strong for the metallicity values we have tested .",
    "thus , we are confident our results do not depend strongly on our chosen metallicity .",
    "still , one should be cautious when comparing with other works which could have used other metallicity values , and therefore another cooling function .      based on our results",
    ", clump formation seems not very likely to occur in the environment of the galactic centre , due to either symmetric or asymmetric stellar encounters .",
    "however , we have not studied a case that probably deserves more attention : _ colliding winds binary systems_.    as shown in section  [ sec : diagn ] , the formation of cold slabs typically requires stellar separations below 1 mpc . while those separations are not often achieved in stellar encounters of single stars , they are easily reached by close binaries .",
    "the census of young massive binary stars in the galactic centre is still incomplete , but the recent study by @xcite increased to three the amount of confirmed binary systems:@xmath98 irs 16sw , a 19.5-day period ofpe / wn9 eclipsing contact binary @xcite , @xmath99 irs 16ne , a 224-day period ofpe / wn9 binary and @xmath100 e60 . ] , a 2.3-day eclipsing contact wolf - rayet binary .",
    "the inferred separations of these binary systems are of the order of 10 @xmath8pc and below .",
    "that , together with the wind properties listed in table  [ tab : stars ] , could make these three binaries very effective sites for clump formation .",
    "irs 16sw is of particular interest , as it has a clockwise orbit that roughly coincided with g2 s at the latter s apocentre .",
    "notice that the wind properties of these stars were assigned by @xcite as mentioned in section  [ sec : colliding ] .",
    "however , we would not expect any important wind component to be substantially faster , as it would show up as broader lines in the spectra .",
    "additionally , from the estimations by @xcite we expect an overall @xmath0% spectroscopic binary fraction for the massive ob / wr stars in the galactic centre .",
    "thus , even though our current knowledge of the binary population in the galactic centre is limited , close binary systems remain as a very promising possibility for the creation of cold clumps . a more detailed numerical model of this process",
    "is deferred to a forthcoming paper .",
    "we have developed a simple and straightforward prescription to study clump formation through the ntsi mechanism in symmetric colliding wind systems .",
    "the input parameters are the mass loss rate , wind terminal velocity and stellar separation .",
    "radiatively efficient wind collisions are capable of creating cold gas clumps ( @xmath101  k ) in a wide range of masses , where the most massive ones are of the order of the earth mass for strong outflows ( @xmath102  @xmath4  yr@xmath2 ) , relatively slow wind terminal velocities ( @xmath103  km  s@xmath2 ) and short stellar separations ( @xmath104  mpc or @xmath105 au ) .",
    "nevertheless , the wide range of unstable wavelengths that are excited prevents us from predicting unequivocal clump masses , as shorter - wavelength perturbations grow faster and might hinder the development of larger - scale ones .",
    "we also found that the possible clump masses depend strongly on the timescale needed for the slab to collapse within the radiative wind regime .",
    "the most massive ones would be generated in systems where the shocked gas does not cool instantaneously , i.e. systems with @xmath11 approaching unity .",
    "studying that regime however is not straightforward as both radiative and adiabatic cooling are important .",
    "our results show that the formation of gas clumps with masses comparable to the g2 cloud is indeed possible in symmetric colliding winds .",
    "however , this scenario does not seem likely in the galactic centre given the currently known mass - losing star sample , as the required sub - mpc separations are very rarely achieved by them .",
    "we also discussed clump formation in asymmetric encounters , finding that the massive and slow outflow of irs 33e could create clumps if confined by a powerful wind of another star .",
    "similarly , the collision of winds from irs 13e2 and 13e4 could also generate a cold slab unstable to the ntsi .",
    "these stars have similar orbits and spend a significant time at short separations , which could explain the presence of many dusty clumps in their vicinity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , they orbit sgr  a * in the opposite sense as g2 , making this pair an unlikely origin for this particular cloud .",
    "a promising possibility is that clumps are produced in close binaries , of which three are currently know .",
    "still , better observational data are required to constrain the wind properties of both components of each binary .",
    "the irs 16sw binary is of particular interest , as its orbit coincides with g2 s at apocentre .    in conclusion , given our current analysis and the available stellar wind data , the formation of g2-like clouds in the galactic centre appears as a possible but not very common event .",
    "we defer more concrete results to a future study using 2d and 3d numerical modelling .",
    "this is required to treat systems with unequal stellar winds , with @xmath106 , or for winds that collide before reaching their terminal velocity , such as compact binaries .",
    "numerical models are also required to follow the growth of different unstable wavelengths and obtain a clump mass function .",
