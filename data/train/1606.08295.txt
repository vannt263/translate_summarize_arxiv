    "there is a strong indication of an observer independent minimum length scale in all theories of quantum gravity , e.g. in string theory @xcite , noncommutative geometry @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite and lorentzian dynamical triangulations @xcite-@xcite to name a few .",
    "this minimum measurable length scale is assumed to be the planck scale .",
    "the mathematical apparatus of general theory theory of relativity is based on a smooth manifold .",
    "this picture breaks down when spacetime is probed at energies of the order of planck energy @xcite .",
    "one therefore expects a radically new picture of spacetime .",
    "this includes departing from the standard relativistic dispersion relation implying the breaking of lorentz invariance .",
    "lorentz symmetry which is well known to be one of the most remarkable symmetries in nature fixes the standard form of energy - momentum dispersion relation to be @xmath1 .",
    "it has been suggested in most theories of quantum gravity @xcite-@xcite that in the ultraviolet limit , the standard energy - momentum dispersion relation gets modified .",
    "for example , in horava - lifshitz gravity , the energy - momentum dispersion relation gets modified in the ultraviolet region @xcite . due to the presence of a maximum energy scale @xmath2 leading eventually to the breaking of lorentz invariance",
    ", theories have been constructed with two universal invariants , namely , the velocity of light @xmath3 and the planck energy @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to modified energy - momentum dispersion relations ( mdr ) .",
    "this generalization of special relativity is called double special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite-@xcite .    in curved spacetime it is possible to make generalization of dsr leading to double general relativity @xcite . in these theories",
    "the geometry of spacetime depends on the energy of the particle used to probe it .",
    "therefore the geometry here is represented by a one parameter family of energy dependent metrics forming a rainbow of metrics .",
    "hence the name rainbow gravity .",
    "the effects of rainbow gravity have led to considerable changes in the thermodynamic properties of black holes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the entropy expression does not contain the logarithmic corrections ( which are well known to be universal ) to the semi - classical area law for all forms of the rainbow functions .    in this paper",
    "we start by studying the modification of the thermodynamic properties , namely , the hawking temperature , heat capacity and entropy for the rainbow inspired schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes .",
    "we compute the critical and remnant masses for these black holes below which the thermodynamic quantities become ill - defined .",
    "it is observed that the rainbow functions prevent the total evaporation of the black holes keeping a remnant in exactly the same way as done by the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we further observe that demanding the universality of logarithmic corrections to the semi - classical area law for entropy constraints the form of the rainbow functions .",
    "the expressions for entropy have a striking similarity to those derived using the gup for these forms of the rainbow functions .",
    "we then make use of the stefan - boltzmann law to estimate the mass output and radiation rate as a function of time taking into account the effects of the rainbow functions .",
    "these characterstics are also observed to be very similar to those obtained from the gup @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the basics of rainbow gravity . in section 3",
    "we study the thermodynamics of schwarzschild black holes taking into account the effects of rainbow gravity . in section 3.1",
    "we obtain the mass output and radiation rate of rainbow gravity inspired schwarzschild black holes as a function of time for different values of the rainbow parameter @xmath0 . in section 4",
    "we study the thermodynamics of reissner - nordstrm black holes taking into account the effects of rainbow gravity .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 5 .",
    "rainbow gravity generalizes the modified dispersion relations in dsr to curved spacetime .",
    "these modified dispersion relations are given by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath2 is the planck energy and the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are called rainbow functions .",
    "these functions are responsible for the modification of the energy - momentum relation in the ultraviolet limit .",
    "however , they should be constrained to reproduce standard dispersion relation in the infrared limit .",
    "this requires @xmath7 in terms of a one - parameter family of orthonormal frame fields , a one - parameter family of energy - dependent metrics can be expressed as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 the quantities with a tilde stand for energy independent frame fields . in the limit @xmath10",
    ", usual general relativity is recovered .",
    "the field equations of einstein are also modified accordingly @xmath11 where the energy dependent newton s universal gravitational constant @xmath12 becomes the conventional newton s universal gravitational constant @xmath13 in the limit @xmath14 . due to this modification the corresponding black hole metrics also get redefined . in this work",
    "we shall choose specific rainbow functions @xcite which are motivated from loop quantum gravity considerations @xcite-@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath0 is the rainbow parameter . in the subsequent discussion , we shall use natural units @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in this section we want to study the thermodynamic properties of schwarzschild black holes taking into account the effect of the rainbow functions ( [ rainbow functions ] ) .",
    "the metric of the schwarzschild black hole inspired by rainbow gravity is given by @xcite @xmath18 the surface gravity is related with the hawking temperature as @xcite @xmath19 where the surface gravity is defined by the relation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the schwarzschild radius . hence , the surface gravity for the rainbow gravity inspired schwarzschild black hole reads @xmath22 therefore , the hawking temperature is given by @xmath23 in obtaining the above expression we have set @xmath24 .",
    "this equation gives a relation between the temperature and mass of the rainbow gravity inspired schwarzschild black hole .",
    "since the temperature has to be a real quantity , we obtain the following condition @xmath25 the above condition readily leads to the existence of a critical mass below which the temperature becomes a complex quantity @xmath26 the heat capacity of the rainbow gravity inspired schwarzschild black hole reads @xmath27 the remnant mass ( where the black hole stops evaporating ) can be obtained by setting @xmath28 .",
    "this yields @xmath29 thus , we have demonstrated that the remnant mass of the black hole is equal to its critical mass .",
    "the entropy can be calculated using the heat capacity of this black hole as follows @xmath30 substituting eq.([modified hawking temperature ] ) in eq.([entropy1 ] ) and carrying out a binomial expansion keeping terms upto @xmath31 and assuming that @xmath32 leads to @xmath33dm}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 8\\pi g\\left[\\frac{m^2}{2}+\\frac { \\eta}{2(2-n)\\left(2ge_p\\right)^n}\\frac{1}{m^{n-2}}+\\frac{{3\\eta}^2}{8(2 - 2n)\\left(2ge_p\\right)^{2n}}\\frac{1}{m^{2n-2}}+\\frac{{5\\eta}^3}{16(2 - 3n)\\left(2ge_p\\right)^{3n}}\\frac{1}{m^{3n-2}}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & s_{bh}+\\frac{{\\pi}^{\\frac{n}{2 } } \\eta}{(2-n)}\\frac{1}{{s_{bh}}^{(\\frac{n}{2}-1)}}+\\frac{3{\\pi}^n{\\eta}^2}{8(1-n)}\\frac{1}{{s_{bh}}^{(n-1)}}+\\frac{5{\\pi}^{\\frac{3n}{2 } } { \\eta}^3}{8(2 - 3n)}\\frac{1}{{s_{bh}}^{(\\frac{3n}{2}-1 ) } } \\label{gen_entropy_expn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the semi - classical bekenstein - hawking entropy for the schwarzschild black hole . the reason for assuming",
    "@xmath35 is that the result of the integration is not valid for @xmath36 as can be seen easily from the integrand . in terms of the area of the horizon @xmath37 , the above expression for the entropy",
    "can be recast in the form @xmath38 where we have set @xmath39 .",
    "it is evident from this expression for the entropy of the black hole that there are no logarithmic corrections to the semi - classical result for the values of @xmath35 .",

    "\\label{entropy for n=1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above expression involves the logarithmic corrections which are known to be universal .",
    "remarkably , the expression for the entropy has a striking similarity with the expression for entropy obtained using generalized uncertainty principle with a linear term in the momentum uncertainty @xcite .",
