    "superconductivity in the cuprates and in the layered organics of the bedt family is highly anomalous , _",
    "i.e. , _ it displays a number of properties that can not be explained by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory modified for @xmath0-wave symmetry .",
    "for example in the cuprates , superconductivity emerges upon doping an antiferromagnetic mott insulator .",
    "moreover , in the so - called underdoped region near the insulator , experiments show that the gap in the single - particle density of states decreases upon doping while @xmath5 , or the order parameter , increases , in sharp contrast with expectations from standard bcs theory @xcite . in the organics , antiferromagnetism and superconductivity",
    "are separated by a first order transition and a mott transition separates the corresponding states with no order . for both the organics and the cuprates ,",
    "there is much evidence from approximate solutions that the essential low - energy physics is described by the one - band hubbard model for the appropriate lattice , band - structure , interaction and dopings meinders:1993 , macridin:2005 , mckenziereview:2007 .",
    "understanding anomalous superconductivity theoretically in a quantitative manner is still a challenge .",
    "an important step towards this goal is to obtain accurate solutions of the hubbard model . despite the apparent simplicity of the model ,",
    "it is extremely difficult to solve in the relevant regime where neither potential ( @xmath2 ) nor kinetic energy ( @xmath6 ) dominate . in recent years",
    ", a number of numerical methods have shed light on this problem . in this paper",
    ", we will describe the results obtained from cellular dynamical mean - field theory @xcite ( cdmft ) for @xmath0-wave superconductivity and its competition with antiferromagnetism in the cuprates .",
    "the corresponding study in the organics has been published @xcite .",
    "the results will be compared with other quantum cluster methods maier:2005 , ltp:2006 , kotliarrmp:2006 , mean - field theories , slave boson , and with variational approaches .",
    "our choice of method is motivated by the following considerations . since anomalous superconductivity appears near antiferromagnetic mott insulating phases , it is important to use approaches that treat these phases correctly .",
    "cdmft is a generalization of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) georges:1996,jarrell:1992 .",
    "the latter method describes the mott insulator - metal transition of the hubbard model exactly in the limit of infinite dimensions .",
    "dmft is , by construction , a local theory that maps the full interacting many - body lattice problem onto a single - site embedded in a self - consistent bath .",
    "unfortunately , the local nature of the spatial correlations inherent to single - site dmft precludes a description of the superconducting phase with @xmath0-wave symmetry observed experimentally in the cuprates .",
    "this limitation has been overcome by several recently developed cluster extensions of dmft .",
    "in addition to cdmft , @xcite these include the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) @xcite and variational cluster perturbation theory ( vcpt ) , @xcite , also known as variational cluster approximation ( vca ) .",
    "these methods incorporate short - range correlations as well as some properties of the infinite lattice in a systematic and causal manner ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "cdmft maps a lattice problem onto a finite - size cluster ( with different boundary conditions than dca ) and is able to describe the short - range correlations accurately within the cluster .",
    "a self - consistently determined bath of uncorrelated electrons approximates the effect of the rest of the infinite lattice on the cluster .",
    "coupling between the embedded cluster and the bath provides a self - consistent theory that naturally allows for phase transitions and phases with long range order . in a way",
    ", cdmft makes a compromise between short - range and long - range correlations , the latter being associated with order parameters that appear only in the bath .",
    "cluster models can be formulated in a general functional framework potthoff:2003b , kotliarrmp:2006 and they all converge to the same limit for very large cluster sizes .",
    "nevertheless , different cluster methods have convergence rates that depend on the physical observable .",
    "in particular , at finite temperatures , cdmft has been shown to converge exponentially quickly for local quantities such as the density of states @xcite .",
    "the quality of the approximation made by cdmft has been tested extensively by comparisons with exact results  @xcite .",
    "the method was found to be accurate in describing the complexities of the mott insulator - to - metal transition , indicating that both high as well as low energy phenomena are well captured .",
    "furthermore , cdmft has also been used successfully to elucidate the differences in the evolution of a mott - hubbard insulator into an anomalous correlated metal for the electron- and hole - doped cases @xcite as well as to shed light on the normal state pseudogap phenomenon @xcite .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe our implementation of cdmft in more details .",
    "we then present the zero - temperature results and compare with those of other numerical approaches .",
    "it is shown that , in the intermediate coupling regime @xmath7 , the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase at zero temperature is stabilized .",
    "in addition , at strong coupling the magnitude of the order parameter scales with @xmath8 we also discuss the effect of longer - range hopping and of the proximity to the mott transition .",
    "we present the phase diagram for both hole and electron - doped systems , exhibiting the competition between @xmath0-wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism .",
    "the regions where @xmath0-wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism appear are in semi - quantitative agreement with experiment , except for a region of coexistence that is not always observed experimentally .",
    "it is striking to observe that as we make the model more realistic by including all the main band structure parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 the coexistence region decreases and the overall phase diagram becomes closer to experiments .",
    "finally , before we summarize the results , we compute the single - particle density of states and show that the order parameter increases with doping in contrast with the single - particle gap that decreases , in qualitative agreement with experiment . in addition , we find that the results of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) damascelli:2003 have a natural explanation in our approach .",
    "discussion of our results in the context of a sample of the existing literature appears at the end of each subsection .",
    "we define the hubbard model hamiltonian by @xmath11where @xmath12 and @xmath2 correspond to the hopping and the onsite coulomb repulsion respectively . in order to investigate the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase within cdmft we write an effective action containing a weiss dynamical field @xmath13 with both normal ( particle - hole ) and anomalous ( particle - particle ) components that describes the degrees of freedom outside the cluster ( the bath ) as a time dependent hopping within the cluster @xmath14 \\psi _ { d}(\\tau ^{\\prime } ) + u\\sum_{\\mu } \\int_{0}^{\\beta } d\\tau n_{\\mu \\uparrow } n_{\\mu \\downarrow } .\\]]for the case of a @xmath15 plaquette , which we shall consider throughout this work , the nambu spinor is defind by @xmath16 , and the greek letters @xmath17 label the degrees of freedom within the cluster .",
    "physically , this action corresponds to a cluster embedded in a self - consistently determined medium with @xmath0-wave pairing correlations .",
    "given the effective action with a starting guess for the weiss field @xmath18 we compute the cluster propagator @xmath19 by solving the cluster impurity hamiltonian that will be described shorty .",
    "then we extract the cluster self energy from @xmath20 . here , @xmath21is an @xmath22 matrix , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the imaginary - time ordered normal and anomalous green functions respectively . using the self - consistency condition , @xmath25 ^{-1}+\\hat{\\sigma}_{c}(i\\omega _ { n } )   \\label{selfcon}\\]]with @xmath26 ^{-1 } , \\label{lattice_g}\\]]we recompute the weiss field @xmath27 and iterate till convergence . here",

    "the average is taken in the ground state of the cluster .    to study the competition with antiferromagnetism ,",
    "while preserving bipartite symmetry , hybridization @xmath54 and bath site energies @xmath55 become spin dependent .",
    "this doubles the number of independent hybridization and bath parameters .",
    "the staggered magnetic order parameter is given by the cluster wave function average@xmath56with @xmath57    the finite size of the bath in the exact - diagonalization technique is an additional approximation to the cdmft scheme .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation can be verified by comparing the cdmft solution for the one - band hubbard model with the solution from the bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "we have also used this comparison in one dimension as a guideline to fix the choice of parameters in the distance function ( @xmath46 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "these results in one dimension also compare well with those obtained using the hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo algorithm as an impurity solver where the bath is not truncated  kyungqmc:2006 .",
    "further , using finite - size scaling for these low ( but finite ) temperature calculations  @xcite , it was shown that , at intermediate to strong coupling , a @xmath15 cluster in a bath accounts for more than @xmath58 of the correlation effect of the infinite size cluster in the single - particle spectrum .",
    "we can also perform an internal consistency check on the effect of the finite bath on the accuracy of the calculation . with an infinite bath",
    ", convergence insures that the density inside the cluster is identical to the density computed from the lattice green function . in practice , we find that there can be a difference of @xmath59 between the density estimated from the lattice and that estimated from the cluster",
    ". we will display results as a function of cluster density since benchmarks with the one - dimensional hubbard model show that , with a finite bath and the procedure described above , one can reproduce quite accurately bethe ansatz results for @xmath60 when the cluster density is used .",

    "is monotonic as a function of doping with a maximum value close to half - filling .",
    "as the system approaches half - filling from optimal doping there is a progressive localization due to the increasing proximity of the mott insulator and hence , despite the stronger @xmath0-wave weiss field in this region , there is a suppression of the @xmath0-wave order parameter .",

    "having established that the @xmath0-wave order parameter @xmath65 decreases towards zero as we approach half - filling , we now show that the gap @xmath145 computed from the single - particle density of states increases monotonically towards half - filling @xmath146 in the hole - doped case .",

    "the results are identical in the limit of infinite bath size .",
    "the single - particle gap is extracted from the local density of states , that we obtain from the lattice green function that will be used later to obtain the single - particle spectral weight @xmath148 .",
    "the lattice green function is computed by periodizing the superlattice green function @xmath149 in eq.([lattice_g ] ) over the entire brillouin zone of the original infinite lattice as is done in cpt @xcite .",
    "this proceeds as follows . in reciprocal space ,",
    "any wave vector @xmath150 in the brillouin zone may be written as @xmath151 where both @xmath150 and @xmath152 are continuous in the infinite size limit .",

    "the gap is defined as half the distance between the two peaks on either side of @xmath156 , as they appear , for example , in the inset.,width=264 ]    the single - particle gap is defined as half the distance between the peaks that surround the minimum near @xmath157 the inset of fig .",
    "[ gap ] shows the local density of states in the superconducting state at @xmath158 due to the finite value of the broadening parameter @xmath159 , some spectral weight fills the @xmath0-wave gap , which vanishes linearly near @xmath160 . we do not focus on this @xmath161 energy scale . in fig .",
    "[ gap ] we exhibit the monotonic increase of the single - particle gap as filling increases toward @xmath146 ( unlike the order parameter decrease ) in accordance with , for example , thermal conductivity @xcite and tunneling experiments renner:1998 , timusk:1999 for the cuprates .",
    "this is a radical departure from a conventional superconductor where the single - particle gap @xmath162 and @xmath65 are proportional to each other .",
    "experimentally in the hole - doped cuprates @xcite , the magnitude of the gap at optimal doping is estimated to be around @xmath163 . here",
    "we obtain @xmath164 which is in good agreement with experimental estimates if we take a reasonable value @xmath165 .",

    "the lower part contains energy distribution curves ( edc ) @xmath170 as a function of frequency in units of @xmath171 for various wave vectors @xmath150 along symmetry directions .",
    "the mdc for hole doping , @xmath172 in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] and electron doping , @xmath173 , in fig .",
    "[ spectra_el ] , are very similar to the corresponding results in the normal state obtained earlier with the same approach ( figs . 5 and 6 of ref .  , and",
    "fig . 4 of ref .  ) and with cpt @xcite , the latter having the best momentum resolution .",
    "they display the striking asymmetry of the hole- and electron - doped cases that can be measured by arpes in the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase @xcite and in the pseudogap phase .",
    "more specifically , for the hole - doped case the fermi energy plot ( mdc ) shows weight near @xmath174 with a clear suppression everywhere else . on the other hand , the electron - doped case fig .",
    "[ spectra_el ] shows weight in complementary areas of @xmath175 and @xmath176 with the largest suppression near @xmath174 .",
    "as shown in an earlier paper @xcite , it is likely that for large values of @xmath2 the correlations responsible for the suppressed weight in the normal state are of short - range antiferromagnetic origin , although the precise nature of the magnetic fluctuations seems less important than the fact that the system is close to a mott insulator civelli:2005 and that there are short - range spatial magnetic correlations induced by @xmath1 .",
    "this is the strong - coupling mechanism for pseudogap discussed in refs .   and .",
    "by contrast , the weak - coupling mechanism does not need to be close to a mott insulator .",
    "it involves long wave length fluctuations @xcite that can be explained by the two - particle self - consistent approach .",
    "the latter mechanism seems to explain  @xcite experimental results in slightly underdoped nd@xmath131ce@xmath77cuo@xmath106 . for a discussion of the pseudogap at large and small @xmath2",
    "see refs . .    in the edc for the hole - doped case on the lower part of fig",
    "[ spectra ] , one can see in the @xmath177 to @xmath178 direction , a gap - like feature between @xmath179 and @xmath180 that looks like the so - called waterfall feature observed in arpes experiments xie:2007,graf:2007,graf:2006,pan:2006,meevasana:2007,valla:2007 .",
    "this has some similarity to what has been obtained in the @xmath109 model @xcite but one should be careful since at these energy scales it is likely that the one - band hubbard model differs from more realistic multi - band models macridin:2005 .",
    "the gap - like feature here occurs between the spin - fluctuation induced band near the fermi energy @xcite and the rest of the lower - hubbard band .",
    "there are differences with dmft calculations since these are appropriate only for higher dimension  @xcite .    in the hole doped case of fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , we do not have the resolution to address the question of whether there are two gaps , one associated with superconductivity , and the other one associated with the pseudogap , as discussed recently in the literature @xcite . this question is clearly most difficult to address in the hole - doped compounds where the pseudogap and superconducting gap occur in the same region of the brillouin zone . in the electron - doped case of fig .",
    "[ spectra_el ] , the position of the pseudogap or of the antiferromagnetic gap near @xmath174 differs from the location of the maximum superconducting gap .",
    "hence , an earlier vca study senechal:2005 with better momentum resolution allowed one to see the superconducting gap in the electron - doped case near @xmath181 at the same time as the ( pseudo)gap near @xmath174 . in our case also , the edc in the lower part of fig . [ spectra_el ] does have both the normal state gap near @xmath182 and the @xmath0-wave superconducting gap near @xmath181 .",
    "the mdc color scheme in the upper part of the same figure is on a relative scale .",
    "hence , despite the fact that there is both a pseudogap and a superconducting gap , the mdc emphasizes that there is less weight in the pseudogap region near @xmath183 than near the superconducting gap region near @xmath184 nevertheless , close inspection reveals that regions of constant intensity carry less weight near @xmath185 than the corresponding normal state results in ref .. also , the weight increases as one moves slightly away from the zone edge along the fermi surface , reflecting the superconducting gap .",
    "experimentally , the superconducting gap in the electron - doped compounds has been seen independently of the pseudogap @xcite .",
    "we have shown that many of the non - bcs features exhibited by superconductivity in the underdoped cuprates can be reproduced by cdmft calculations for the two - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "for example , the fact that the zero - temperature @xmath0-wave superconducting order parameter decreases as we move towards half - filling while the gap in the single - particle density of states increases .",
    "we have demonstrated semi - quantitative agreement with other cluster methods and with experimental results for other quantities as well , such as the arpes spectrum and the doping range where superconductivity is stable .",
    "we have also calculated the phase diagram that describes the competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivitity for @xmath93 for both hole and electron doping at various values of @xmath2 .",
    "there is in general homogeneous coexistence ( superconducting antiferromagnetism or equivalently antiferromagnetic superconductivity ) between antiferromagnetism and @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the underdoped region .",
    "this feature is quite generally observed in quantum - cluster methods , variational approaches and mean - field theories that do not allow for spin or charge density modulations on large length scales . in experiment , such coexistence seems to be the exception rather than the norm . at large @xmath186",
    "the transition between the coexistence phase and the pure @xmath0-wave state is first order .    without attempting any precise fits to experimental data",
    ", it seems that the phase diagram obtained for @xmath93 at intermediate coupling @xmath187 corresponds with the experimental phase diagram better than either smaller @xmath188 or larger @xmath189 values of @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , adding the third neighbor hopping @xmath119 , as suggested by band structure , leads to an improvement of the qualitative agreement between the calculated and observed phase diagrams , namely a reduced tendency to coexistence and a larger electron - hole asymmetry .",
    "the sensitivity to band parameters , expected at intermediate coupling where both kinetic and potential contributions are comparable , hints towards quantitative deviations from the universal @xmath138 curve for compounds with different band parameters , such as la@xmath131sr@xmath190cuo@xmath106 ( lsco ) and yba@xmath102cu@xmath81o@xmath135 ( ybco ) .",
    "the major questions left open by the present work are : a ) whether the hubbard model by itself , without additional interactions , additional bands , or without extrinsic disorder , can lead to a closer agreement with the experimental phase diagram when additional broken symmetries are allowed in the space of solutions @xcite b ) if the additional broken symmetries that are present in cuprates appear as secondary instabilities or are essential to the physics of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "nevertheless , the hubbard model seems sufficient to lead to the overall phase diagram of the high - temperature superconductors and to explain many of the observed non - bcs features , even in the absence of a final answer to the last questions raised . in bcs theory",
    ", it is useful to think about the mechanism for superconductivity , _ _ i.e. _ _ * *  * * what perturbation makes the normal state unstable towards a superconducting ground state .",
    "similarly , in the weak - coupling hubbard model , finite temperature dca maier:2007a , maier:2007b , maier:2007c and two - particle self - consistent calculations ( tpsc ) kyung:2003 , suggest that in this case it makes sense to think of @xmath0-wave superconductivity as being mediated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations bourbonnais:1986,miyake:1986,scalapino:1986,carbotte:1999 , a generalization of the kohn - luttinger mechanism . in this weak-",
    "to intermediate - coupling case , pairing occurs when the antiferromagnetic correlation length is large @xcite . at strong coupling",
    "though , we have shown , in agreement with other approaches , that the order parameter scales with the superexchange interaction @xmath1 , even when we do not allow for large antiferromagnetic correlation lengths ( which in the cluster treatements are mimmicked by antiferromagnetic long range order ) .",
    "this shows that at strong coupling , @xmath0-wave superconductivity can occur directly from the superexchange  @xcite @xmath1 , without the need for an antiferromagnetic `` glue '' or antiferromagnon exchange , as advocated by anderson @xcite .",
    "still , at large @xmath2 , the frequency dependence of the order parameter has a complicated frequency dependence with multiple scales present @xcite .",
    "antiferromagnetism and @xmath0-wave superconductivity are two possible phases of the strong - coupling hubbard model .",
    "the normal state found in cdmft is unstable to either phase or to a coexistence phase , depending on parameters and on doping .",
    "the cdmft normal state contains both types of fluctuations , @xmath0-wave and antiferromagnetic . at strong coupling",
    "it does not appear necessary to think that antiferromagnetic fluctuations lead to @xmath0-wave superconductivity or that @xmath0-wave superconducting fluctuations lead to antiferromagnetism .",
    "this is perhaps best illustrated by the layered organic conductors that can be modeled by a one - band hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice at half - filling .",
    "there , one finds , theoretically and experimentally , a first order transition between antiferromagnetism and @xmath0-wave superconductivity @xcite , so both phases are different instabilities of the same hamiltonian .",
    "cdmft and a number of methods show that maximum pairing ( maximum value of the @xmath0-wave order parameter ) occurs at intermediate coupling , a range appropriate for the high - temperature superconductors .",
    "so both weak and strong - coupling features may appear @xcite .",
    "one of the ways to distinguish weak and strong coupling limits is by the behavior of the @xmath0-wave order parameter as one approaches half - filling . at strong coupling",
    ", it decreases as @xmath191 when @xmath2 is larger than the critical @xmath2 for mott localization .",
    "the phase fluctuations and short - range antiferromagnetic correlations that lead to the decrease need not be long range : they occur within the cluster . at weak coupling on the other hand , the decrease in the order parameter near half - filling",
    "does not occur unless antiferromagnetic fluctuations with correlation lengths large enough to create the pseudogap are included @xcite .",
    "exactly at half - filling , weak and strong coupling limit are separated in the normal state by the mott transition @xcite , in the absence of magnetic long range order .",
    "away from half - filling , one can postulate that when the correlation length of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations become of the order of the lattice spacing , then @xmath1 by itself suffices to lead to pairing at strong coupling .",
    "there may not be a sharp phase transition between the two extreme limits .",
    "quantum cluster methods are powerful numerical ways of attacking the problem of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "they clearly show that many aspects of the physics of the high temperature superconductors are contained in the hubbard model .",
    "the convergence between the results of these methods and those of other recent numerical approaches suggests that we are closing in on methods that can provide a quantitative solution of this problem .",
