    "the analysis of flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays is one of the most promising directions in particle physics , theoretical as well as experimental , as a potential testing ground for the standard model ( sm ) and as regards to the physicists endeavor to comply fully for establishing new physics beyond the sm @xcite . along these lines ,",
    "the rare @xmath1 meson decays which takes place via the fcnc , play an exceptional role .",
    "for example , an investigation of these rare decays opens the way for the possibility of a more precise determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xcite .",
    "currently the main interest on the rare meson decays is focused on the decays for which the sm predicts the largest branching ratios that can be measurable in the near future .",
    "the rare ( @xmath2 ) processes are such decays . for these decays",
    "the experimental situation is quite promising with @xmath3 and hadron colliders focusing only on the observation of exclusive modes with lepton pairs as the final states .",
    "the decay , which is described by @xmath4 transition at quark level , has been investigated extensively in both sm and two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is well known that in the 2hdm , the up type quarks acquire their masses from yukawa couplings to the higgs doublet @xmath5 ( with the vacuum expectation value @xmath6 ) and down type quarks and leptons acquire their masses from yukawa couplings to the other higgs doublet @xmath7 ( with the expectation value @xmath8 ) . in 2hdm",
    "there exist five physical higgs fields : neutral scalar @xmath9 , @xmath10 , neutral pseudoscalar @xmath11 and charged higgs bosons @xmath12 .",
    "such a model occurs as natural a feature of the supersymmetric models @xcite . in these models",
    "the interaction vertex of the higgs boson and fermions depends on the ratio @xmath13 which is a free parameter in the model .",
    "the constraints on @xmath14 are usually obtained from @xmath15 mixing , @xmath16 decay width , semileptonic decay @xmath17 and is given by @xcite : 0.7 tan 0.6 ( )  , ( the lower bound @xmath18 is obtained in @xcite ) .    in all these studies the contributions from neutral higgs boson exchange diagrams",
    "are neglected , since the lepton - lepton - higgs vertices are proportional to the lepton mass .",
    "but for the @xmath19 decay the mass of the @xmath0 lepton is not too small compared to the @xmath20 quark mass , and hence one expects that the neutral higgs boson exchange diagrams may contribute considerably to such channels .",
    "it has been pointed by hewett @xcite that the longitudinal polarization @xmath21 of the final lepton is an important observable that may be accessible in the decay mode .",
    "recently it has been shown in @xcite that the complementary information is contained in @xmath21 , together with the two other orthogonal components of polarization ( @xmath22 is the component of of the polarization lying in the decay plane and @xmath23 is the one that is normal to the decay plane ) . both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are crucial for the @xmath24 channel since they are proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath4 transition contains three wilson coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the sm .",
    "the different components of the polarization , i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , involve different combinations of wilson coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see below ) and hence contain independent information .",
    "for this reason the polarization effects are thought to play an important role in further investigations of the structure of the sm and for establishing new physics beyond it .",
    "the query for the calculation of the branching ratios and other observables requires the computation of the matrix element of the effective hamiltonian responsible for the decay between @xmath1 and @xmath28 states .",
    "this problem is related to the non - perturbative sector of qcd and it can be solved only by means of a non - perturbative approach .",
    "these matrix elements have been investigated in the framework of different approaches such as chiral theory @xcite , three point qcd sum rules method @xcite , relativistic quark model by the light - front formalism @xcite , effective heavy quark theory @xcite and light cone qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to calculate these matrix elements in the light cone qcd sum rules in the framework of the 2hdm , taking into account the newly appearing operators , @xmath29 , and to study the forward - backward asymmetry and final lepton polarization for the exclusive decay .",
    "taking into account the additional neutral higgs boson exchange diagrams , the effective hamiltonian is calculated in @xcite as _ eff = v_tb v^*_ts \\{_i=1 ^ 10 c_i ( ) o_i ( ) + _",
    "i=1 ^ 10 c_q_i ( ) q_i ( ) }  , where the first set of operators in the curly brackets describe the effective hamiltonian responsible for the @xmath30 decay in the sm .",
    "note that the contributions arising from the diagrams containing the charged higgs bosons are taken into account by modifying the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "these diagrams do not induce any additional operators .",
    "their explicit forms and the corresponding wilson coefficients @xmath31 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the second set of operators in the brackets , whose explicit forms are presented in @xcite , come from the exchange of the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the corresponding wilson coefficients are :    c_q_1 ( m_w ) & = & -   tan^2 \\ { ( sin^2 + h cos^2 ) f_1 ( x , y ) + + & + & f_2(x , y ) + + & + & f_3 ( y ) } [ cq1 ]  , + c_q_2 ( m_w ) & = & tan^2 \\ { f_1(x , y ) + f_2(x , y ) } [ cq2 ]  , + c_q_3 ( m_w ) & = & [ cq3 ]  , + c_q_4 ( m_w ) & = & [ cq4 ]  , + c_q_i(m_w ) & = & 0   i = 5 ,  , 10 [ cqi ]  , where    @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34    the qcd correction to the wilson coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be calculated using the renormalization group equations . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 do not mix with @xmath39 , so that the wilson coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath27 remain unchanged and their values are the same as in the sm .",
    "their explicit forms can be found in @xcite , where it is also shown that @xmath41 can mix with @xmath42 .",
    "but additional terms due to this mixing can safely be neglected since the corrections to the sm value of @xmath43 arising from these terms are less than @xmath44 when @xmath45 .",
    "moreover the operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 do not mix with @xmath48 and @xmath49 and also there is no mixing between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "for this reason the evolutions of the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 are controlled by the anomalous dimensions of @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath54 .    neglecting the strange quark mass ,",

    "in addition to the short distance contributions , it is possible to take into account the long distance effects associated with real @xmath61 in the intermediate states , i.e. , with the cascade process @xmath62.these contributions are taken into account by introducing a breit - wigner form of the resonance propagator and this procedure leads to an additional contribution to @xmath63 of the form @xcite - _",

    "@xmath79 is the usual triangle function and @xmath80 .",
    "as we have noted previously , the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath81 and the final lepton polarization involve different combinations of the wilson coefficients @xmath82 , and @xmath51 and therefore each of them contains independent information . for this reason , here in what follows",
    "we study these quantities in more detail .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath81 is defined as : @xmath83    note that in the sm , the forward - backward asymmetry is zero when the polarization of the final lepton is summed over .",
    "the reason is obvious : the hadronic current for the @xmath84 transition is a pure vector current .",
    "but forward backward asymmetry ( or charge asymmetry ) is non - zero only if there exists c - violating terms . in the 2hdm",
    "there is a c - violating term proportional to @xmath85 ( see eq.([m2 ] ) ) , so that , @xmath81 is nonzero and is proportional to the lepton mass . for small values of @xmath14 ,",
    "the contributions from the neutral higgs boson exchange diagrams are very small , and hence one expects that the value of @xmath81 be small also .",
    "but for large @xmath14 , the contributions of the neural higgs boson exchange diagrams become significant and we expect @xmath81 to be large .",
    "the numerical analysis confirms these expectations ( see numerical analysis section ) .",
