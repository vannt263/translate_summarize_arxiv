    "in the last two years , data on high - energy cosmic - ray electrons and positrons have attracted a great deal of interest . the positron fraction measurement reported by the pamela collaboration in ref .",
    "@xcite , combined with the high - statistics electron - positron ( ) flux measurement by the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) collaboration @xcite are widely believed to conclusively point to a new class of primary positron sources in the galaxy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , one such class that has been widely advocated and discussed of late is the pair - annihilation or the decay of galactic particle dark matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a more mundane possibility , but by no means more or less disfavored by currently available data , is that the new class of positron sources is associated to nearby mature rotation - powered pulsars , as earlier envisioned in relation to the recent cosmic - ray data e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while from the point of view of advancing our understanding of the fundamental structure of particle physics the dark matter scenario appears more appealing , pulsars might constitute if not the entirety of the detected positron excess , at least a potentially very significant background to searches for new physics . in this respect , gaining an accurate understanding of the contribution of pulsars to the local flux of high - energy addresses questions that go beyond the realm of classical high - energy astrophysics and that are of relevance to the quest for physics beyond the standard model as well .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration recently delivered @xcite the first catalogue of 46 high - confidence gamma - ray pulsars , based on the first six months of lat data .",
    "roughly half of these pulsars were discovered using radio ephemerides , i.e. monitoring the locations and timing , in the gamma - ray sky , of known radio pulsars .",
    "the remaining pulsars were discovered by looking for a pulsed emission in bright gamma - ray sources , either corresponding to the potential locations of neutron stars identified via observations at other wavelengths , or via the pulsar blind - search campaign ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; finally , 6 pulsars correspond to previously known egret gamma - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "the scope of the present study is to assess the contribution of pulsars in the first fermi - lat gamma - ray pulsar catalogue to the local flux of high - energy cosmic - ray electrons and positrons .",
    "there are several reasons to believe that gamma - ray pulsars contribute significantly to the local flux . on theoretical grounds ,",
    "the mechanism through which gamma rays are produced in the pulsar magnetosphere necessarily requires the generation of high - energy electron - positron pairs , independent of whether particle acceleration and radiation occurs in the neutron star polar cap ( see e.g. ref .  ) or in the so - called outer gap ( @xcite ) .",
    "a possible caveat is the case of gamma rays produced by curvature emission from primary out - flowing electrons escaping magnetized neutron stars : in this case no positron counterpart would be produced by the gamma - ray emitting object .",
    "while over 1,800 radio pulsars are known @xcite , it is widely believed that these radio - loud objects only constitute a fraction of the wider class of rotation powered pulsars .",
    "the pulsar radio catalogue completeness is not only flux - limited , but  more importantly  it is limited by the pulsar radio beam geometry : a radio pulsar is visible only if the relatively narrow radio beam crosses the observer s line of sight .",
    "gamma - ray pulsars , on the other hand , are believed to exhibit much wider beams : powerful nearby injectors might thus very well be radio - quiet due to geometry , and yet produce a significant flux of gamma radiation .",
    "an outstanding example is the geminga pulsar , that has been advocated e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite as the possible main contributor to the excess of cosmic - ray positrons detected by pamela .",
    "we therefore find it compelling to use the recent high - confidence list of gamma - ray pulsars to study the contribution of this class of primary positron emitters to the local flux .",
    "one of the main difficulties in assessing the contribution of gamma - ray pulsars to the local cosmic - ray flux is the lack of information on the pulsar distance , especially if the pulsar has not been detected yet at other wavelengths . in the present analysis , we start , in sec .  [",
    "sec : dist ] , from a systematic evaluation of the distance to the relevant gamma - ray pulsars in the first fermi - lat pulsar catalogue , calibrated on previously available information on distances to selected objects , and making use of information from the measured gamma - ray flux and pulse shape and from the simulation results of the gamma - ray pulsar `` atlas '' of ref .",
    "we then proceed in sec .  [",
    "sec : contrib ] to evaluate the contribution from the fermi - lat gamma - ray pulsars to the flux of local leptonic cosmic rays , in the context of a simplified model for the flux of injected in the ism from the pulsar magnetosphere , and we compare with existing recent related studies @xcite .",
    "we then explore the relevant pulsar parameter space , with respect to the expected contribution from radio - quiet versus radio - loud pulsars ( sec .  [",
    "sec : paramspace ] ) , summarize and conclude ( sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] ) .",
    "a pulsar is believed to consist of a rapidly rotating neutron star radiating across different wavelengths .",
    "pulsars are remarkably stable clocks , emitting radiation with very precise time periods , with little or no variablity . while first discovered at radio wavelengths , pulsars have been detected across all wavelengths , including in the high - energy regime . with the launch of the space - based gamma - ray telescopes egret and of the current generation instrument , the lat on board the fermi space telescope",
    ", pulsars have been discovered to pulse in gamma - rays , a crucial step to pinpoint the mechanism itself by which pulsars radiate .",
    "gamma - ray pulsars are rotation - powered pulsars , where the electromagnetic radiation is fueled through the loss of angular momentum .",
    "while only a tiny ( of the order of @xmath1 ) fraction of rotational energy is emitted at radio frequencies , the fraction of spin - down luminosity converted into gamma - rays is typically much larger , and not infrequently of order unity , making pulsar rotation directly responsible for their high - energy radiation ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . broadly speaking , gamma - ray pulsars exist in two distinct populations : young , energetic pulsars , and old , recycled millisecond pulsars . since are injected in the ism in the early stage of a pulsar s lifetime , and since the very efficient energy losses for high - energy limits their injection age , millisecond pulsars are not relevant for our present purposes , and we thus only focus here on energetic , relatively young ( characteristic age less than 10 myr ) pulsars .",
    "these pulsars spin with typical frequencies in the range 0.25 - 100 hz and feature relatively large spin - down energies @xmath2 .",
    "electrons and positrons produced in the pulsars magnetosphere , however , are trapped by the termination shocks of the pulsar wind neabula and flow into the ism only when the envelope is suppressed enough .",
    "this process of diffusion of the produced in the regions around the neutron star into the ism has a characteristic timescale ranging between @xmath3 and @xmath4 yr ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic - ray from very young pulsars , like vela , might therefore not have diffused into the ism yet @xcite and should not contribute significantly to the detected local flux .",
    "the timescale of injection in the ism therefore generically further cuts out the youngest pulsars as contributors to the local flux .",
    "the detection of gamma - ray pulsars proceeds via two possible pathways @xcite : ( i ) by using the localization and timing information provided by radio ephemerides and folding on the gamma - ray photon data to detect gamma - ray pulsations ( known as _ radio - selected gamma - ray pulsars _ ) , and ( ii ) by calculating periodicity in the gamma - ray photon data alone using blind frequency searches ( known as _ gamma - selected gamma - ray pulsars _",
    "both methods are robust and have yielded the discovery of close to 50 high - significance gamma - ray pulsars in total @xcite .",
    "the spin - down luminosity @xmath5 of a rotation powered pulsar is simply the derivative of the rotational kinetic energy @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the characteristic age @xmath8 is the time it would take an ideal magnetic dipole born spinning at infinite frequency to slow to the observed pulsar frequency today .",
    "it is only a rough estimate of the actual age of the pulsar , but it provides useful information in determining which population of pulsars might contribute the most to the local flux , since as we shall see below the injection time crucially enters the diffusive propagation of charged leptonic cosmic rays .",
    "the characteristic age can be calculated simply from the spin parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 : @xmath11 .    to calculate the distances of the gamma - ray pulsars detected by fermi - lat",
    ", we use the heuristic model of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gamma - ray luminosity in the 0.1 gev to 100 gev energy range , @xmath5 is the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar , @xmath14 is the gamma - ray efficiency , and @xmath15 is a constant of order unity that is in principle theoretically calculable given a pulsar gamma - ray production mechanism . here , we take a phenomenological approach and we calibrate the coefficient @xmath15 by fitting it to fermi - lat gamma - ray data for the 15 pulsars from the brightest lat source list catalogue @xcite with solid associated distance determinations ( the latter taken from ref .",
    "we also considered the theoretically naive possibility that the gamma - ray luminosity is simply proportional to the available rotational energy of the neutron star , i.e. @xmath16 , although somewhat disfavored by data from the above mentioned gamma - ray pulsars with distance determinations @xcite . in this case , the gamma - ray luminosity of pulsars with a low spin - down luminosity is suppressed , leading in turn to a suppressed estimate for the distance to most of the relevant gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "this implies therefore that the assumption that @xmath16 leads to an over - estimate of the contribution from gamma - ray pulsars . in other words",
    ", the assumption we employ for the gamma - ray pulsar luminosity leads to conservative predictions for the flux of cosmic - ray .",
    "the most precise distances to pulsars are determined from parallax measurements , but this method is only reliable for small distances ( @xmath17 pc ) . for pulsars with no or unreliable parallax data , one must make use of other means of distance determination , such as radio disperson measure or x - ray absorption . in particular , the dispersion measure ( dm ) distance estimate hinges upon the effect on the pulsar radio beam of the integrated column density of free electrons between the earth and the pulsar . the interaction between radio pulses and the charged particles ( i.e. free electrons ) in the galaxy causes the pulses to be delayed by an amount depending on the electron density and on the radio frequency . by measuring the frequency shift and using a model for the distribution of free electrons , one can assess the distance to radio pulsars .",
    "most radio pulsar distances in the fermi pulsar catalog @xcite are obtained in this way .",
    "dispersion measurements in ref .",
    "@xcite make use of the ne2001 electron density distribution model of ref.@xcite .",
    "other distance measurements used in the first lat pulsar catalogue include using the doppler shift of absorption or emission lines in the neutral hydrogen spectrum ( hi ) , and x - ray flux measurements ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "to estimate the distance to a pulsar with gamma - ray measurements , we use the relation @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the _ flux correction factor _ , which is a pulsar - dependent and model - dependent quantity that translates between the phase - averaged flux observed along the earth line of sight and the gamma - ray flux averaged over the entire sky ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath20 is the estimated distance to the pulsar , and @xmath21 is the @xmath22-ray energy flux inferred by the fermi analysis of the gamma - ray flux and spectra @xcite ( this quantity is indicated in @xcite with the symbol @xmath23 ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath15 is assumed here to be universal , and to estimate its value we restrict our analysis to pulsars closer than 10 kpc and with a characteristic age @xmath24 yr .",
    "incidentally , this implies that the spin - down luminosity of the pulsars we consider have spin - down luminosities @xmath25 erg s@xmath26 .",
    "while for very distant pulsars the uncertainty on the distance from radio measurements is very significant , the constraint on age stems from the fact that the maximal energy produced @xmath27 yr ago can have today is smaller than roughly 20 gev , and therefore pulsars older than @xmath27 year can not contribute significantly to the local flux in the energy range of interest here .",
    "notice also that this cut on the pulsar age excludes milli - second pulsars as well .",
    "interestingly , the range of spin - down luminosities selected by the cuts we employ corresponds to one where the heuristic formula of eq .",
    "( [ eq : grlum ] ) should hold : in several motivated pulsar gamma - ray emission models , including the slot and outer - gap frameworks , below a spin - down luminosity of @xmath28 erg s@xmath26 the gap saturates and the potential drop is almost entirely employed to fuel the pair cascade processes , breaking the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : grlum ] ) , as pointed out e.g. in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the constraints on age and distance leave 10 pulsars out of the 15 lat bright pulsars with solid distance determinations , namely j0534 + 2200 ( crab ) , j0835 - 4510 ( vela ) , j0633 + 1746 ( geminga ) , j1709 - 4429 , j1952 + 3252 , j1057 - 5226 , j1048 - 5832 , j0631 + 1036 , j1028 - 5819 and j1509 - 5850 .",
    "the value for the flux correction factor @xmath19 is calculated for each individual pulsar , and derived using the results of the `` atlas '' presented in @xcite , and making use of predictions from both the outer gap ( og ) and the two - pole caustic ( tpc ) models .",
    "the correction factor also depends on the magnetic inclination angle @xmath29 and on the observer viewing angles @xmath30 ; since we do not have exact values for either one of these angles , we can at best find a range of values for @xmath19 from the peak separation observed and reported in the first lat pulsar catalogue , ref .",
    "the first step is to choose the most plausible model for @xmath19 : following the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , for those pulsars which have a peak separation of 0.15 - 0.30 the og model is the clear choice , while for separations larger than 0.47 the tpc model is typically more adequate .",
    "for intermediate peak separations , we find that the og model predicts values of @xmath19 giving distance estimates closer to the catalogue distances in almost all cases . to estimate the coefficient @xmath15 we therefore employ , for intermediate peak separations , the @xmath19 predictions from the og model",
    ".    given the assumptions above for the pulsar model , we then estimate @xmath19 for each of the 10 pulsars we use to calibrate the parameter @xmath15 in the following way : we derive the value of the gamma - ray efficiency @xmath31 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : grlum ] ) and use the results of the simulations of @xcite corresponding to the value of @xmath31 closest to what we derive from the actual measured gamma - ray and spin - down luminosities .",
    "we then utilize the measured gamma - ray peak separation between the two most prominent peaks , as found in @xcite , to record the range of viewing and magnetic inclination angles .",
    "finally , this range is used to infer , again using the results of the simulated pulsars of ref .",
    "@xcite , the flux correction factor @xmath19 for each individual pulsar .",

    "the level of emission of high energy is expected to be pulsar - dependent , and no consensus exists on a robust theoretical prediction for the spectrum and normalization of this flux . for the sake of illustration , we adopt here a simple and easily reproducible model for the emission from pulsars , and for the propagation of high - energy from the neutron star to the earth . also for simplicity and to allow for a comparison among the various pulsars we adopt the same parameters and assumptions for all objects .",

    "although the physical mechanism that produces in the pulsar magnetosphere is presumably the same that then gives rise to the gamma - ray emission @xcite , reacceleration in the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) or in the supernova envelope can significantly affect the spectral index .",

    "we adopt the value @xmath41 tev , compatible with the expected decrease with time ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the large cutoff energy expected from the observed very high - energy gamma - ray emission from the pwn of young pulsars @xcite .",
    "we neglect here the time delay between the pulsar birth and the point in time when are injected in the inter - stellar medium ( @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : injspec ] ) ) because ( i ) the uncertainty in the characteristic age versus the actual pulsar age is of the same order of magnitude as the ism injection time scale , and ( ii ) our results are basically insensitive to this parameter for the pulsars that contribute the most to the local flux .",

    "the range of injection spectral indices ( 1.5  2 ) encompasses our choice of 1.7 .",
    "our estimate for the total energy output for geminga is larger than what considered in @xcite , although the smaller distance partly compensate for it .",

    "the spectra presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for the geminga pulsar appear to be slightly different from what we show in fig .",

    "this is due to both slightly different choices for the cosmic - ray propagation parameters ( smaller diffusion coefficient , @xmath95 ) , and to the fact that in @xcite a time - dependence for the process of injection in the ism was included ( leading to an output tail of higher energy cosmic rays ) , and that in @xcite a fully relativistic solution to the diffusion - loss equation based on the jttner formalism is employed . in both cases ,",
    "though , the overall predicted output from geminga is comparable to the present estimate based on gamma - ray data . finally , ref .",
    "@xcite uses a theoretical setup which is very close to what we employ here , but does not single out the geminga or monogem pulsars , hence a direct comparison with our results is not directly obvious",

    "we further elaborate on this point in fig .",

    "[ fig : r100 ] the percent contribution of gamma - ray pulsars to the measured flux at @xmath93 gev , with the parameter space assumptions specified above , as a function of the pulsar age ( left panel ) and spin - down luminosity ( right panel ) .",

    "we find that at least four new fermi - lat pulsars should give a non - negligible contribution ( more than 1% ) at @xmath93 gev .",
    "we thus find that the currently known gamma - ray pulsars that might contribute to the local flux span a wide range of both characteristic age and spin - down luminosities , respectively between @xmath4 and @xmath96 yr and @xmath5 between @xmath97 and @xmath98 erg / s .    the relative contribution from pulsars to the at the peak of @xmath99 ( @xmath100 being the local flux per steradian from the given pulsar )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpeak ] , as a function of the pulsar distance and peak location . in the figure",
    "we indicate the horizontal errorbars corresponding to the uncertainty on our gamma - ray pulsar distance determination , as well as the resulting propagated uncertainty on the contribution at peak . as expected , the main pulsar contributors lie relatively close to us , at most at a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "the contribution from further pulsars decreases steeply with distance .",
    "the energy where the pulsar contribution to the flux is expected to peak , with respect to the measured local cosmic - ray flux , ranges between 100 gev and 1 tev .",
    "the location of this peak is a function of the pulsar age , that sets the maximal energy @xmath101 electrons and positrons can have a time @xmath61 after injection .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : rpeak ] , right panel , where we correlate the peak position to the pulsar age .",
    "the contribution from older pulsars peaks at lower frequencies , while younger pulsars tend to contribute at higher energies .",

    "we show said contribution as a function of the pulsar age , on the right as a function of the pulsar spin - down luminosity .",

    "the inset in the right panel shows the flux peak energy as a function of the pulsar age.[fig : rpeak],title=\"fig:\",width=604 ] +",
    "while the ratio of the gamma - ray flux from a given pulsar over the pulsar luminosity scales as @xmath102 , i.e. it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the observer to the pulsar , the contribution of pulsars to the local flux has a significantly more complicated dependence on distance .",
    "this stems from the fact that the propagation of from the pulsar to the earth proceeds via a diffusive process .",
    "similarly , unlike the gamma - ray flux , the flux has a critical dependence on the pulsar age . here , as detailed above , we model the diffusive mechanism of charged particles losing energy and changing direction scattering off of the magnetic fields irregularities in the picture encompassed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffloss ] ) . in turn",
    ", this implies the non - trivial and highly non - linear dependence of the pulsar contribution to the flux on distance given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sol ] ) .",
    "in particular , this dependence is very sensitive to the pulsar age and to the assumed diffusion coefficient , via the energy - dependent diffusion radius @xmath103 .    as a result of the non - trivial propagation of in the galaxy , it is not obvious which of the bright gamma - ray pulsars are the most important contributors to the local cosmic - ray flux . in this section",
    "we investigate and outline the portions of the pulsar parameter space where pulsars are expected to contribute to the flux , and the overlap of these regions with the fermi - lat sensitivity to the emission from gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "this allows us to determine which regions of the pulsar parameter space , important to understand the local flux , might be within reach with further improvements to the fermi - lat sensitivity to pulsed gamma - ray emission , and which regions are equally important but beyond the reach of the lat .     +    in fig .",
    "[ fig : edotage ] we consider the parameter space plane defined by the pulsar age versus the pulsar spin down luminosity , for pulsars with a distance around 0.4 kpc ( left ) and around 0.8 kpc ( right ) .",
    "pulsars within the yellow - shaded area are expected to contribute to the local flux by more than 1% , for an efficiency @xmath47 .",
    "we also include vertical black lines corresponding to the pulsars with the lowest spin - down luminosity ( and hence lowest theoretical gamma - ray flux @xmath104 ) in that given distance range .",
    "this gives a benchmark of the fermi - lat gamma - ray sensitivity for pulsars in the given distance range ( notice that this is only to guide the eye , since the gamma - ray flux depends on the pulsar - dependent gamma - ray efficiency and on the geometric flux correction factor ) .",
    "we indicate , for purposes of illustration , pulsars from the atnf catalogue ( blue diamonds ) and fermi - lat pulsars ( black circles ) with distances in the range between 0.2 and 0.6 kpc ( left ) and between 0.6 and 1.1 kpc ( right ) .",
    "the corresponding yellow contours would of course be different for each individual pulsar at its own distance , but this illustrates , for instance , that the largest contribution to the local flux of is expected to come from gamma - loud rather than from radio - loud pulsars ( naturally , some gamma - ray pulsars expected to be significant contributors , such as geminga , have also been detected at radio frequencies @xcite ) . also remarkably , regions of parameter space naively unaccessible to fermi - lat ( i.e. to the left of the vertical lines ) appear to be devoid of radio pulsars , implying that no significant contributor is expected to be radio - loud and gamma - quiet .",
    "the upper cutoff in age for the pulsars contributing to the local flux simply stems from the maximal energy cutoff as a function of energy @xmath105 the non - trivial dependence on pulsar age that cuts off the contribution from young pulsars depends , instead , on the fact that for young pulsars and for energies such that @xmath106 , the diffusion radius is @xmath107 so that the contribution from a young pulsar further away than 0.5 kpc is negligible at 100 gev . in the picture where cosmic - ray follow a random - walk path , this means that the diffusion radius of a young pulsar , at some given energy , is not large enough for the cosmic rays to diffuse to us .",
    "the shape of the parameter space shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edotage ] reproduces the analytic approximation outlined above .",
    "+    fig .",
    "[ fig : edotdist ] shows the orthogonal parameter space direction of pulsar distance versus spin down luminosity , for pulsars with an age around @xmath4 yr ( left ) and @xmath108 yr ( right ) .",
    "the black dots refer to gamma - ray pulsars , while the blue diamonds to atnf pulsars . for the former ,",
    "we take the distance from the present analysis , while for the latter we use the distances quoted in the atnf catalogue @xcite .",
    "notice that we include all atnf pulsars in the specified age ranges ( @xmath109 yr in the left panel and @xmath110 yr in the right panel ) , irrespective of whether or not they are theoretically expected to produce gamma rays . in the context of the outer gap model , for instance",
    ", the condition for a rotation powered pulsar to produce gamma rays is that the ratio of the physical size of the outer gap over the ratio of the light cylinder be less than one , see e.g. ref .",
    ". this condition can be re - expressed in terms of the pulsar period @xmath111 in seconds and of the pulsar magnetic field at the neutron star surface @xmath112 in units of @xmath113 g as @xmath114 not all the atnf pulsars we show fulfill this criterion .",
    "as before , we add black lines to help guide the eye to the region of parameter space that should be detectable by fermi . here , we draw lines corresponding to the gamma - ray pulsar with the lowest @xmath115 in the range shown , for @xmath116 ( solid ) and @xmath117 ( dashed ) .",
    "objects to the lower - right of the lines should give ( for a gamma - ray efficiency and geometric flux correction factor comparable to the reference pulsar ) a gamma - ray flux detectable by fermi - lat .",
    "the shape of the parameter space where pulsars are expected to contribute to the local flux of is here understood by considering the diffusion radius in the limit of mature enough pulsars , i.e. for energies such that @xmath118 . in this case , the diffusion radius is independent of the pulsar age , and it takes the value : @xmath119 the distance above sets the quadratic - exponential decay scale for the local flux with the pulsar distance @xmath120 , @xmath121 $ ] observed in the figure .",
    "the pulsar age influences the precise location of the contour in the plane via the effect on the spectrum of the maximal energy exponential cutoff .",
    "[ fig : edotdist ] , right , shows that pulsars which have not been detected in gamma rays yet ( those corresponding to the blue diamonds ) can in principle contribute significantly to the cosmic - ray flux as long as ( i ) they have a large enough spin - down luminosity and ( ii ) they are close enough ( from the figure to the right we infer a distance cutoff around 2 - 3 kpc for ages on the order of a mega - year ) .",
    "we label some of the atnf pulsars that follow in the portion of parameter space where pulsars are predicted to contribute to the percent level to the flux , and that fulfill the above - mentioned gamma - ray pulsar outer - gap condition @xmath122 .",
    "we find that several of these gamma - ray quiet atnf pulsars ( as of the first fermi pulsar catalogues ) can potentially give significant contributions to the flux . those same objects ,",
    "however , are also expected to give a potentially detectable gamma - ray flux , and are thus ideal targets for lat monitoring for a pulsed emission .",
    "incidentally , we notice that the age of these pulsars , @xmath123 yr , indicates that their most significant contribution to the flux would fall in the energy range around 100 - 200 gev ( see e.g. the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : rpeak ] , right ) .    notice that contours of constant contribution from pulsars to the local flux at 100 gev would follow the shape of the yellow contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : edotdist ] .",
    "this means that , for instance , the atnf gamma - ray quiet pulsars close to the edge and above the solid black line in the right panel , while potentially beyond the fermi gamma - ray sensitivity , are less likely to significantly contribute to the flux of at earth .",
    "in this paper we estimated the contribution to the local electron - positron flux from the gamma - ray pulsars in the first fermi - lat pulsar catalogue .",
    "we carried out estimates of the pulsar distances and their uncertainties from the fermi gamma - ray flux and pulse shape .",
    "we calibrated our distance estimates with those pulsars with available alternate distance determinations . for a fixed choice of pulsar parameters relevant to the injection of electrons and positrons , we estimated the contribution of the set of known gamma - ray pulsars to the local high - energy cosmic - ray lepton flux .",
    "we found that ten fermi - lat pulsars can potentially contribute significantly to this flux .",
    "of these ten potential contributors , six are among newly discovered pulsars , found in the first fermi blind - search campaign , and have very dim or no associated radio signal .",
    "we explored the ranges of pulsar ages and distances where we theoretically expect gamma - ray pulsars to contribute most significantly to the local cosmic - ray lepton flux .",
    "we found that regions of parameter space exist where gamma - ray pulsars would significantly contribute to the flux without producing a gamma - ray flux detectable by fermi - lat .",
    "however , known radio pulsars fall in regions of parameter space where the contribution is predicted to be typically much smaller than those regions where fermi - lat pulsars exist .",
    "we also found that radio pulsars with ages around one mega - year that have not yet been detected in gamma rays might also contribute significantly to the local flux . in summary , we conclude that gamma - ray searches for mature and relatively nearby pulsars play a crucial role in understanding the origin of the local high - energy cosmic - ray electron and positron flux .",
