    "ngc  4435 ( vcc1030 ) , an early - type sb0@xmath1(7 ) galaxy @xcite member of the virgo cluster , is of great interest because it is a nearby example of galaxy interactions in the cluster environment .",
    "ngc  4435 is experiencing an off - center encounter with ngc  4438 , a bulge dominated late - type galaxy lying at a projected separation of 4.3   ( i.e. 20 kpc , adopting a virgo distance of 16.1 mpc from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "evidence of the strong on - going interaction comes from the well developed stellar tidal tail ( @xmath230 kpc ) of ngc  4438 but also from the structure of the inter stellar medium ( ism ) of both galaxies .",
    "h@xmath3 + [ ] images",
    "@xcite reveal several ionized gas filaments starting from the disk of ngc  4438 and extending out of the disk up to 10 kpc .",
    "the study of the distribution of the cold gas shows that co and are displaced west of the center of ngc  4438 , although co is present also in the center of ngc  4435 .",
    "@xcite proposed a model of the encounter based on the combined picture coming from the ism observations and simulations .",
    "these latter authors indicate that the evolution of ngc  4438 has been influenced by its passage though the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , where ram - pressure stripped the in about 100 myr . during this period ,",
    "ngc  4435 passed through the disk of ngc  4438 at high velocity ( @xmath2 800 km  s@xmath4 ) , but the ism - ism interaction of the two galaxies had a less important effect on the final distribution of the gas than the cluster ram - pressure stripping exerted by the icm .",
    "if the above is the general picture of the ngc  4435/38 encounter , its effects on the evolution of ngc  4435 are less clear . in low density environments , @xcite showed that early - type galaxies show little or no ir or optical signatures of star formation when physically paired to a gas rich companion .",
    "however , some of the early - type members do show significant levels of ir and h@xmath3 emission that indicate both thermal ( star formation ) and non thermal ( agn ) activity .",
    "these pairs are among the best candidates for direct interaction fueling of both starburst and active galactic nuclei .",
    "ngc  4435 currently has an ism .",
    "hst images reveal the presence of a circumnuclear disk of 4  radius ( 360 pc , inclination 44 deg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , nebular emission lines were detected by several authors @xcite ; in particular @xcite , using the classical diagnostic diagrams , classified this galaxy as t2/h : , i.e. a transition object between liner 2 and .",
    "@xcite studied the ionized gas kinematics using hst - stis in the central 2  looking for a super massive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "the rotation curve is very symmetric , indicating a regular rotation .",
    "their analysis indicates that the mass of the smbh ( upper limit @xmath5 ) is lower than that expected from the @xmath6-@xmath7 and @xmath6-@xmath8 relations .",
    "coccato et al .",
    "suggest that the smbh in ngc  4435 could be of the `` laggard '' type as discussed in @xcite , although these seem to lurk among galaxies that spend most of their lifetime in the field , at least apparently at odds with ngc  4435 s cluster location .",
    "in this paper we study the _ spitzer _ irs mir spectra of ngc  4435 presented in @xcite and perform a comprehensive analysis of the entire sed of the galaxy .",
    "in particular , the study of the mir region , rich in spectral features ( emission lines , pah , dust emission etc . ) provides an independent view of the nature of the nuclear activity of this galaxy @xcite .",
    "combined with the analysis of the panchromatic sed , it allows the characterization of the star formation activity and the estimate of the mass of stars formed during this interaction , shedding light on the rejuvenation mechanism in interacting early - type galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : observ ] we provide details of the observations and data reduction methods . in   [ sec : miranalysis ] we describe the results of the study of the spectrum in the mir region , while in   [ sec : sedglobal ] we extend the modeling to the entire galaxy sed . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the result of our analysis and compare them with other studies .",
    "finally in   [ sec : conclu ] we summarize the conclusions .",
    "_ spitzer _ irs spectral observations of ngc  4435 were obtained during the first _ spitzer _ general observer cycle on 2005 june 1 as part of a program ( i d 3419 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to study early - type galaxies that belong to the colour  magnitude relation of the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "the observations were performed in standard staring mode with low resolution ( @xmath9 64128 ) modules sl1 ( 7.515.3@xmath10 m ) , sl2 ( 57.6@xmath10 m ) and ll2 ( 14.121.3@xmath10 m ) , with 6 exposures of 60 seconds for each sl module and 10 exposures of 120 seconds for the ll2 module .    since the adopted irs pipeline ( version s12 )",
    "is specifically designed for point source flux extraction , we have devised a new procedure to flux calibrate the spectra that exploits the large degree of symmetry that characterizes the light distribution in early - type galaxies .",
    "the reduction procedure is described in detail in @xcite thus here we only summarize the main steps .    for sl observations ,",
    "the sky background was removed by subtracting observations taken in different orders , but at the same node position .",
    "ll segments were sky - subtracted by differencing the two nod positions .",
    "we obtained new e@xmath11/s to jy flux conversions by applying a correction for aperture losses ( alcf ) and a correction for slit losses ( slcf ) to the flux conversion tables provided by the spitzer science center ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . by applying the alcf and slcf corrections",
    ", we obtained the flux _",
    "received _ by the slit .    for each galaxy of the program , we simulated the corresponding observed linear profile along the slits by convolving a wavelength dependent bidimensional intrinsic surface brightness profile with the instrumental point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the adopted profile is a two dimensional modified king law @xcite . by fitting the observed profiles with the simulated ones",
    ", we can reconstruct the intrinsic profiles and the corresponding intrinsic sed .",
    "this procedure has also the advantage to recognize whether a particular feature is spatially extended or not .",
    "finally the spectrum was extracted in a fixed width ( 18  for sl and 10.2  for ll ) around the maximum intensity . in order to account for the different extraction area",
    ", the ll spectrum has been rescaled to match that of sl ( 3.6@xmath1218 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : hst ] we overplot the extraction area and the irs slit positions on an hst wfpc2/f814w image of the ngc  4435 nucleus by @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty on the flux was evaluated by considering two sources of noise : the instrumental plus background noise and the poissonian noise of the source .",
    "the former was evaluated by measuring the variance of pixel values in background - subtracted coadded images far from the source .",
    "the poissonian noise of the sources was estimated as the square root of the ratio between the variance of the number of e@xmath11 extracted per pixel in each exposure , and the number of the exposures .",
    "the total noise was obtained by summing the two sources in quadrature and by multiplying by the square root of the extraction width in pixels .",
    "we notice that the overall absolute photometric uncertainty of irs is 10% , while the slope deviation within a single segment ( affecting all spectra in the same way ) is less than 3% ( see the spitzer observer manual ) .",
    "irac and mips images of ngc  4435 were retrieved from the ssc archive .",
    "they were taken as part of the program i d 3649 .",
    "fluxes at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8  @xmath10 m were measured from the irac images as output from the `` post - bcd '' pipeline . the proximity of ngc  4435 to ngc  4438 results in a weak contaminating flux component .",
    "this was treated by estimating the median background flux from the image containing ngc  4435 so that the subtracted background included the contaminating light .",
    "fluxes were extracted in circular apertures centered on the brightest pixel at each wavelength .",
    "given that the calibration of extended sources for irac is still somewhat uncertain the fluxes so extracted have errors of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "similarly , we measured fluxes at 24 , 70 and 160  @xmath10 m from mips mosaics as output from the `` post - bcd '' pipeline .",
    "fluxes were extracted in circular apertures centered on the brightest pixel at each wavelength , subtracting the median background flux measured far from the source .",
    "uncertainties for mips fluxes are quoted to be @xmath14 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the spitzer observer manual ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in all mips images the galaxy appares almost as a point source ; in particular at 24  @xmath10 m where the angular resolution is higest the galaxy image is only slightly larger than the instrumental psf ( 6 ) .",
    "the final flux calibrated irs spectrum of ngc  4435 is shown in the top - left panel of figure [ fig : spectrum_tot ] .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by numerous pah features and shows several nebular emission lines , [ ] 7@xmath10 m , [ ] 12.8@xmath10 m , [ ] 15.5@xmath10 m and [ ] 18.7@xmath10 m , and molecular hydrogen rotational lines , h@xmath0 s(3 ) 9.66@xmath10 m , h@xmath0 s(1 ) 17.04@xmath10 m .    in order to measure the fluxes of emission lines and to identify the pah features , we fitted the spectrum via decomposition into various components : pah emission features , emission lines and underlying continuum .    for all the pah features but those at 11.2 and 12.5 @xmath10 m",
    ", we assumed a drude profile .",
    "the features at 11.2 and 12.5 @xmath10 m are very asymmetric thus we have used the profiles observed by @xcite , convolved to the sl1 resolution .",
    "it is worth noticing that the emission profiles derived by @xcite do not account for the blending of the wings of the pah features .",
    "consequently our underlying continuum shows a broad feature .",
    "however , since the main purpose of this section is to estimate the emission line intensities , this does not affect our conclusions .",
    "for the emission lines we adopted a gaussian profile , with a fwhm given by the resolving power of the corresponding irs module ( see the _",
    "observer s manual , v. 6.0 , sec .",
    "the resulting fits of the three most interesting spectral regions are shown in figure [ fig : spectrum_tot ] .",
    "+ [ fig : spectrum_tot ]      in the irs spectrum of ngc  4435 we can identify many pah emission features already known from iso and pre - iso studies : at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.2 , 8.6 , 11.2 , 11.9 , 12.7 , 13.5 , 14.5 , 15.9 , 16.4  @xmath10 m ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "besides those features , we also see a number of new components that have been revealed by recent _ spitzer",
    "_ observations .",
    "these are the feature at 10.7  @xmath10 m and , most notably , the complex around 17  @xmath10 m .",
    "the nature of the former is unknown but there is similar evidence in m82 @xcite , ngc  7714 @xcite and ngc  7331 @xcite spectra .",
    "the complex around 17  @xmath10 m ( figure [ fig : spectrum_tot ] , bottom - right panel ) is similar to that observed in the spiral galaxies ngc  7331 and in the extended emission of m82 @xcite .",
    "this complex is superimposed on h@xmath0 s(1 ) emission but in our case , since the h@xmath0 s(1 ) emission is fainter than that seen in ngc  7331 and m82 , we can more accurately extract the underlying emission components .",
    "in fact , while @xcite claimed the presence of a new broad emission feature at 17.1  @xmath10 m with a fwhm of 0.96  @xmath10 m , in our spectrum this feature appears to be a blend of two components ; a narrow component centered at 17.4  @xmath10 m with a fwhm of 0.33  @xmath10 m and a broad component centered at 16.9  @xmath10 m with a fwhm of 1.1  @xmath10 m . notice that the component centered at 17.4  @xmath10 m was observed by @xcite in various galactic star formation regions .",
    "thus our observations indicate that the new pah emission feature is centered at 16.9  @xmath10 m . in the same spectral region",
    "we also find an emission feature at 19.07  @xmath10 m that was observed in the ncg  7023 reflection nebula by @xcite .",

    "classically , the determination is done using optical emission lines .",
    "optical spectra of the nuclear region of ngc  4435 were observed by @xcite . using the diagnostic diagrams of @xcite , @xcite classified ngc  4435 as a transition object between liner and , via the value of [ ] 6300/h@xmath3 ( = 0.13 ) which",

    "@xmath27    where @xmath28 is the luminosity of the line emitted by the transition starting from the state @xmath23 , @xmath29 is the transition probability , and @xmath30 the frequency of the transition .",
    "assuming local thermal equilibrium , the ratio between number of molecules in state @xmath23 and the total number of h@xmath0 molecules per unit of volume is given by the boltzmann equation @xcite :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the h@xmath0 rotational constant .    for an isothermal gas",
    "all the data in the excitation diagram of figure [ fig : h2diag ] should lay on a linear relation @xmath33 with @xmath34 . however , the observed values do not lay on the same line , suggesting the presence of two ( or more ) components at different temperatures , a `` warm '' component at @xmath35 k traced by the s(1 ) line ( and the s(2 ) upper limit ) and a `` hot '' component at @xmath36 k , traced by lines at shorter wavelengths . with equations",
    "[ eq : nilum ] and [ eq : boltz ] we can estimate the mass of the `` warm '' and `` hot '' components . assuming a temperature of 200 k for the warm component , we find a mass of @xmath37 , while for the `` hot '' component we find a mass of @xmath38 .    the excitation mechanism for hot and warm molecular gas in galaxies is commonly attributed to uv flux from young stars in photodissociation regions ( pdr ) , shocks or x - ray flux from an active nucleus @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on the temperature derived from s(1 ) and s(2 ) lines excludes agn excitation .",
    "in fact @xcite find that in seyfert galaxies the temperature from these lines is typically around 350 k. indeed , the temperature we find is compatible with pdr models by @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the mass of the warm gas is only a tiny fraction ( @xmath39 ) of the total molecular gas observed in ngc  4435 from co lines ( @xmath40 , * ? ? ?",
    "this fraction is also significantly smaller than that found in typical powerful starbursts ( 1  10% ) or in seyfert galaxies ( up to 30% , * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with our finding that the star formation in ngc  4435 has already declined and is more characteristic of a post - starburst phase , as we discuss in the following sections .",
    "note that the above values are not corrected for dust attenuation .",
    "however , the attenuation we derived from the model fit to the global sed in the following sections is quite low ( @xmath41 ) at these wavelengths .      from the intensity of the pf@xmath3 , neon and argon lines we could obtain an estimate of the metallicity of the ionized gas , following the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "in fact , for a generic element x and as long as the current density is lower than the critical density for collisional de - excitation of the involved transitions , the abundance relative to hydrogen is given by : @xmath42}}{q_{\\rm [ xii]}h\\nu_{\\rm [ xii]}}+ \\frac{f_{\\rm [ xiii]}}{q_{\\rm [ xiii]}h\\nu_{\\rm [ xiii]}}+ .... \\right ) \\label{eq : abund}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the emissivity for the pf@xmath3 , and @xmath44}$ ] is the collisional excitation rate of [ ] transition ( for electronic density near to zero ) .",
    "the above abundances can be translated into metallicity estimations by dividing them by standard ism abundances .",
    "we notice however that , while we are confident on the determination of metal line intensities , the pf@xmath3 falls in the wing of a broad pah emission feature .",
    "the measurement of pf@xmath3 intensity is thus unreliable , even if the fitting procedure gives a small uncertainty ( reported in table [ tab : emlines ] ) .",
    "for this reason we do not proceed with a direct determination of the abundances in this way .",
    "however an alternative way to exploit the good measurements of metallic lines in order to derive the metallicity is to use the hydrogen line intensity as predicted from the fit to the global sed of the galaxy .",
    "this will be discussed in a following section .",
    "the analysis of the mir spectrum made in the previous section indicates that a star formation activity is present in the circumnuclear disk of ngc  4435 . in order to better characterize the emission mechanisms and the stellar population content of this galaxy we will model the panchromatic sed of ngc  4435 by means of our spectro - photometric code grasil with the recently updated treatment of pah emission based on iso data ( for details on grasil",

    "the uv / fir ratio implies that the burst luminosity is almost completely reprocessed by dust and emitted in the fir , thus the fir luminosity fixes the bolometric luminosity of the burst .",
    "the emission line luminosities and radio fluxes constrain the star formation rate in the last 50 myr determining the timescale @xmath62 .",
    "once the current sfr and @xmath62 are determined , the age of the burst is fixed by its luminosity .",
    "finally , the h@xmath3 and h@xmath61 constrain the attenuation at optical wavelenght ( see section [ sec : attlaw ] for more details ) .",
    "our assumption of an exponentially declining sfr is the simplest model consistent with a schmidt - type law that reproduces the multiwavelength sed .",
    "other more complex scenarios could probably be able to fit the data introducing , however , further free parameters that are not justified .",
    "indeed , stars in the obscured burst older than @xmath63 50 myr do not provide observable `` features '' to disentangle the detailed shape of the star formation history .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the effects of a underlying star formation activity already present in ngc  4435 before the interaction ( i.e. older than @xmath63 200 myr ) .",
    "stars originated from this activity would unlikely remain confined to the dusty disk .",
    "for example in our galaxy , stars older than 150 myr show larger spatial distribution than younger stars @xcite .",
    "thus the intermediate age stars would now be mostly outside the dusty disk and , as a consequence , they would suffer from only a small or negligiable attenuation . since stars 200500 myr old are still important emitters at uv wavelengths , they would contribute significantly to the galex fluxes .",
    "however , the measured uv galex and nir fluxes within the 5  aperture ( fig .",
    "[ fig : central_sed ] left panel ) , are already entirely accounted for by the old population and the obscured starburst .",
    "actually , the observed fuv flux within the 5  aperture corresponds to an activity not larger than sfr @xmath64 yr@xmath4 between 200 and 500 myr ago .",
    "this suggests that no significant underlying intrinsic star formation activity was present and , consequently , that the observed burst was triggered by the interaction .",
    "the old stellar population dominates the emission in the optical and nir range but is significant also in the mir .",
    "in fact we see from figure [ fig : central_sed ] that the fractional contribution of the starburst to the irs spectrum increases with wavelength .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the spatial analysis along the slit presented in section [ sec : irs_redu ] .",
    "we find that the continuum below @xmath65 @xmath10 m looks extended , while the emission at longer wavelengths ( in particular the pah features ) looks unresolved , in agreement with the different concentration observed in iso lw2 and lw3 images @xcite , irac and mips images , as detailed below .",
    "finally we notice that the fit of the sed does not require an agn component , which adds further support for the lack of agn activity in ngc  4435 .    in the following we discuss in more detail the results of the fit .",
    "the old stellar component is well fitted by a solar metallicity ssp of 8 gyr and a mass of @xmath66 .",
    "note that the value here derived for the stellar mass depends on the adopted imf .",
    "@xcite give an estimate of the mass to light ratio ( @xmath67 ) of the population that can be directly compared with our old stellar population .",
    "using the @xmath68 band they measured @xmath69 , while for our old stellar population it is @xmath70 .",
    "the discrepancy in the @xmath67 can be solved by changing the slope of the imf at lower masses ( as in the kroupa imf , * ? ? ? * ) or adopting a higher lower mass limit ( e.g. 0.2 @xmath57 ) without changing the predicted seds .",
    "the nuclear disk is in a post - starburst phase ( @xmath71 myr and @xmath46 = 186 myr ) with a current star formation rate ( sfr@xmath72  yr@xmath4 ) about one order of magnitude smaller than the average star formation rate ( @xmath73  yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "the quality of radio data , however , prevents a determination of @xmath62 better than @xmath74% ; this results in an uncertainty on the age of the sturburst @xmath46 of the same order .",
    "the mass of gas converted into stars during the burst is @xmath75 ; however with the adopted imf , only @xmath63 80% still survive .",
    "the star forming component emits 32% of the bolometric luminosity in the central 5  of the galaxy , while accounting for 1.4% of the stellar mass .",
    "most of the starburst luminosity is provided by a stars , reprocessed by the diffuse dust and re - emitted in the 8 - 1000  @xmath10 m spectral region ( @xmath76  w ) .",
    "a population of a stars in the central @xmath77 pc has already been detected by optical observations @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite estimated that the contribution of the young burst from 3000    to 5700    in the nuclear region ( 013 radius ) is around 12% . in the same spectral region",
    "we estimate that the fractional contribution of the starburst is only 6% .",
    "it is however hard to compare the two estimates because our value refers to a much larger region ( 5 ) .",
    "indeed it is sufficient that in the very central region the attenuation be reduced ( as estimated by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to eliminate this discrepancy without affecting significantly the constraints from the other spectral bands .",
    "the strongly declining sfr makes this galaxy a typical cases where different sfr indicators , probing different timescales , provide estimates that are apparently discrepant .",
    "in fact with the classical sfr estimation based on the ir luminosity provided by @xcite we get sfr@xmath78  yr@xmath4 , in between the average sfr and the current one . using the 1.4 ghz flux with the @xcite calibration we get sfr@xmath79  yr@xmath4 .",
    "this value is more similar to the current sfr value than the ir based estimate because the radio emission is due to free - free emission from hii regions and synchrotron emission from core collapse supernovae .",
    "though the star formation history is well constrained by the fit of the total sed , a further refinement to the relative spatial distribution of stars and dust can be obtained by the comparison of the predicted and observed h@xmath3 and h@xmath61 line intensities .",
    "it was shown in previous works that a system with an equal spatial distribution of stars and dust produces a much smaller reddening than a `` screen '' geometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "with the assumption of equal scales for stars and dust and given the strong attenuation implied by the observed uv / fir ratio , the h@xmath3 intensity predicted by our best fit model would be much smaller than the observed value ( @xmath68(h@xmath3)= 2.82@xmath80  w m@xmath81 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the predicted gas mass about twice the quoted value @xmath82 @xcite . to solve this discrepancy we need to decrease the attenuation in the optical band leaving unchanged that in the uv .",
    "without modifying the optical properties of dust grains , this can be achieved by assuming a geometry where the diffuse dust is more extended than the stellar distribution .",
    "this has the effect of increasing the reddening , because it reddens the attenuation law making it more similar to the extinction of a uniform slab . adopting a radial ( vertical ) scale length of 160 ( 22 ) pc for the diffuse dust and of 70 ( 14 ) pc for the stellar component",
    "the predicted intensities for h@xmath3 and h@xmath61 are @xmath68(h@xmath3)= 2.70@xmath80 w m@xmath81 , and @xmath68(h@xmath61)= 4.99@xmath83 w m@xmath81 well in agreement with the observed value ( 4.99@xmath83 w m@xmath81 for h@xmath61 from * ? ? ?",
    "the required dust mass is @xmath84 . for a solar metallicity , as predicted by other observables discussed below , this implies a gas mass @xmath85 , fairly near to the observational value .",
    "the estimated mean attenuation of the system in the v band is @xmath86 mags .",
    "the resulting attenuation law is shown in figure [ fig : attenuation ] . in the same figure we plot , for comparison , three different extinction curves from @xcite .",
    "we stress that the dust properties adopted in the model are such that they reproduce the galactic extinction law , corresponding to @xmath87=3.1 .",
    "thus the geometry of the model ( including the effects of age dependent attenuation ) produces an effective attenuation law which is very different from the adopted intrinsic extinction properties of the dust @xcite .",
    "the best fit to the ngc  4435 sed is obtained by adopting solar metallicity for both stars and gas in the starburst .",
    "following the detailed study of nebular emission models of @xcite we can also compute the predicted intensities of selected emission lines .",
    "this is particularly useful for abundance determinations with infrared lines in the absence of good measurements of hydrogen recombination lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as in the present case .",
    "in fact from the sfr obtained from the fit of the sed , grasil also computes the ionizing flux and thus , the observed intensity of the main emission lines .",
    "this can be considered as an alternative method to obtain the ionizing flux from a direct measurement of the hydrogen recombination lines . adopting solar metallicity and standard ism abundances",
    "we obtain the following predicted intensity : @xmath88pf@xmath89 w m@xmath81 , @xmath88[]@xmath90 w m@xmath81 , @xmath88[]@xmath91 w m@xmath81 , @xmath88[]@xmath92 w m@xmath81 and @xmath88[]@xmath93 w m@xmath81 . for the metallic lines",
    "these figures are in good agreement with the observed values reported in table [ tab : emlines ] , thus providing an independent confirmation that the gas metallicity is solar .",
    "the value found for pf@xmath3 is much lower than that derived from the fit of the line , suggesting that the blend with pah prevents an accurate measurement ( see section [ sec : abbdet ] ) .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : central_sed ] shows a detailed comparison mir _",
    "spectrum and the model .",
    "the continuum and pah features up to 13  @xmath10 m are well fitted by the starburst model . at wavelengths longward of 13  @xmath10 m , while the predicted continuum matches fairly well that observed , the predicted pah features are in disagreement with those observed , both in central wavelength and strength .",
    "only the 16.4  @xmath10 m feature is reproduced .",
    "we recall that our model for pah emission is based on the @xcite model , which predicts pah features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , 11.9 , 12.7 , 16.4 , 18.3 , 21.2 , and 23.1 @xmath10 m .",
    "the model of pah features at @xmath94 m was based on iso data for the diffuse galactic medium . while the fwhm and the cross sections for the features at @xmath95 @xmath10 m were taken from the theoretical study of 40 families of pahs driven by @xcite , because of the lack of corresponding observational data .",
    "more recently , iso extended the observed wavelength range , and confirmed the feature at 16.4 @xmath10 m , and also found new features at 14.2 and 17.4 @xmath10 m , as well as a weak plateau between 15 and 20 @xmath10 m @xcite .",
    "this plateau is attributed to a blend of many emission features provided by the interstellar pah families present in the sources , and its variation can be accommodated by variations in the pah populations @xcite .",
    "lately , the higher sensibility of _ spitzer _ confirmed the existence of pah features at 14.2 , 16.4 and 14.7 @xmath10 m , and a new and prominent feature at 17.1 @xmath10 m , among other weaker ones ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the lack of features at 18.3 @xmath10 m , 21.2 @xmath10 m , and 23.1 @xmath10 m has been confirmed .    the disagreement between model and data was already noticed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who , on the other hand , found very good agreement between the li & draine model and the data for @xmath96 @xmath10 m .",
    "they attributed the disagreement at wavelengths longward of 13 @xmath10 m to the large pah sensitivity to their global molecular structure , since they involve the motion of the molecules as a whole , and therefore , they are very dependent on the exact pah species in the emitting source .",
    "work is in progress to improve our pahs emission model based on new _",
    "observations .",
    "we have also compared our models with the total aperture sed of the galaxy .",
    "the total aperture sed includes the u , b , v , j , h , and k bands from goldmine ; the lw2 ( 6.75  @xmath10 m ) and lw3 ( 15  @xmath10 m ) iso bands from @xcite ; the uv ( 2000 ) from deharveng et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , all iras bands ( with the exception of 25  @xmath10 m ) , and the radio measurement described in section [ sec : sedglobal ] .",
    "these data are complemented by our irac flux measurements and galex data for the full aperture .",
    "the data are reported in table [ tab : data2 ] .",
    "the fit to the total aperture sed was done simply by changing the amount of the old stellar population and using the same starbust component that fits the central sed , as derived in the previous sections .",
    "the resulting total mass of the old stellar population is m@xmath97 .",
    "moreover , the star forming component emits 8% of the total bolometric luminosity of the galaxy , while its stellar mass is only 0.3% of the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "it is worth noting that the starburst in n4438 ( the late type companion ) accounted for a smaller fraction ( about 0.1% ) of its total stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the observed full aperture sed and the model is shown in the figure [ fig : total_sed ] .",

    "chandra _ by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was fitted with a thermal component in the soft ( 0.3 - 2 kev ) band attributed to hot gas , and a non - thermal component responsible for the 2 - 10 kev band emission . the hard component , with a luminosity of @xmath98 w , is mostly concentrated within 3from the galaxy center .",
    "this emission was attributed to a possible low luminosity agn ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) plus recent star formation activity .",
    "the observed hard x - ray luminosity of ngc  4435 is about five times larger than that expected from the fir luminosity and the x - ray ",
    "fir correlation found for starbursts galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , adopting the calibration by @xcite , the sfr implied by the observed hard x - ray luminosity turns out sfr@xmath99  yr@xmath4 , one order of magnitude higher than the current sfr derived from the fit to the global sed .    though this seems to support the agn nature of the hard emission component we need to consider the peculiar star formation history of ngc  4435 .",
    "in fact , due to the much higher sfr at the beginning of the burst , the average sfr is consistent with the x - ray estimate .",
    "for this reason we expect a significant contribution to the x - ray luminosity from intermediate mass stars accreting onto neutron stars and/or black holes , through roche - lobe mass transfer . to check this possibility we have computed the x - ray emission expected from the star formation activity derived previously , with the synthesis model of @xcite . the resulting value is consistent with the observed hard x - ray luminosity of ngc  4435 .",
    "moreover , we notice that the x - ray luminosity is much less dependent on the age of the stellar population ( the turn - off mass of the stars ) than the fir luminosity .",
    "this implies that , in post starburst galaxies , the x - ray  fir luminosity ratio tends to be larger than that of pure starbursts which are dominated by massive stars .",
    "another indication of the strength of the agn comes from the comparison of the hard x - ray luminosity and h@xmath3 emission .",
    "using the relation between @xmath100-@xmath101 , derived for agn @xcite , the expected h@xmath3 luminosity would be @xmath102 w. this value is about 15% of the observed @xmath101 corrected for extinction via the balmer decrement .",
    "this contribution to the ionizing flux is higher than the limit derived from mid infrared nebular lines ( sect .",
    "[ sec : sf_agn ] ) .",
    "however it must be considered as a generous upper limit because on one hand all the x - ray luminosity has been attributed to the agn and , on the other , it is known that the balmer decrement provides only a lower limit to the attenuation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact if we correct the observed @xmath101 with the attenuation derived from our best fit model we obtain an upper limit to the agn contribution @xmath635% , consistent with what is found from the [ ] / [ ] ratio .",
    "ngc  4435 is interacting with ngc  4438 ; in particular , simulations by @xcite suggest that ngc  4435 passed through the disk of ngc  4438 about 100 myr ago at a radial distance of 5 - 10 kpc .",
    "with such an impact parameter the interaction of the ism of the two galaxies is unavoidable .",
    "the age of the starburst @xmath103 derived from our fit is larger than the ( dynamically estimated ) time since the ism - ism collision ( around 100 myr ) , but it is consistent with the epoch of the onset of interaction .",
    "this suggests that the star formation was triggered by the interaction ( as often seen in galaxy - galaxy simulations , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) possibly producing a relevant activity also before the ism - ism collision .",
    "we can not , however , draw strong conclusions on the relative importance of the tidal interaction and ism - ism collision , because it is difficult to derive the detailed shape of the star formation history during the burst .",
    "another phenomenon that may be triggered by galaxy - galaxy interaction is agn activity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however the various lines of evidence shown in this work indicate a lack of current agn activity .",
    "the age of the circumnuclear starburst is several times larger than the typical duration of the agn phase and we can not rule out the possibility that an agn was once active in ngc  4435 .",
    "however the surrounding gas is predominantly in a cold phase with only a fraction in a hot component ( @xmath104 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is supported by circular motion @xcite , indicative of a relaxed ism .",
    "we conclude that the feedback from the possible agn was not strong enough to halt the star formation process which is now fading as a result of the gas consumption .",
    "alternatively , the agn activity has not been triggered yet ( and perhaps will not be triggered at all ) .",
    "@xcite provide a 3@xmath7 upper mass limit of 7.5@xmath105 for the possible central smbh , an order of magnitude lower than the value obtained from the @xmath6-@xmath7 and @xmath6-@xmath8 relations . in this case",
    "ngc  4435 could be a prototype of the so called `` laggard '' smbh which are believed to undergo slow gas fueling of the galactic center and limited growth of the smbh mass @xcite .",
    "the above picture sketched for the evolution of ngc  4435 would suggest that the star formation activity could inhibit the agn feeding both by consuming the gas and by sne feedback .",
    "both cases point towards a relatively low efficiency of the agn feedback with respect to that of the sne in intermediate / small mass galaxies like ngc  4435 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "irs spectra combined with irac and mips archival data and existing broad band measurements from x - ray to radio wavelengths .",
    "the pah features in the spectrum are very similar to those observed in other star forming galaxies . in particular , we report the detection of the pah feature observed at 17.1 @xmath10 m @xcite which , due to the lower contamination by the h@xmath0 s(1 ) rotational line , we show is actually a blend of two distinct components",
    ".                    the age of the starburst , @xmath106 myr , corresponds to the epoch of the last encounter with ngc  4438 derived from dynamical simulations , suggesting that this interaction has triggered the observed star formation event @xcite .",
    "however we can not draw strong conclusions on the relative importance of the tidal interaction and ism - ism collision , because of the difficulty in deriving the detailed shape of the star formation history during the burst .",
    "the combination of _ spitzer _ observations with the analysis of the complete sed allows an accurate determination of the mass and epoch of the rejuvenation episode .",
