    "the orion nebula is one of the most interesting hii regions that still reveals intriguing phenomena .",
    "indeed , orion is one of the nearest star forming regions ( located at a distance of 450 pc ) and , consequently the phenomena can be studied with the highest angular resolution . in the orion region",
    "coexist several phases of the interstellar medium , such as molecular , neutral , and ionized gas . with the development of near ir imaging and spectroscopy in recent years",
    ", new phenomena have been revealed that constitute important clues to the understanding of the process of star formation and the evolution of shocks in a molecular environment . in this work",
    "we show the results of a fabry - perot kinematical study of the orion nebula that was mainly motivated by :     the excellent hst image coverage of the orion nebula that reveals a plethora of new objects like herbig - haro ( hh ) objects and proplyds ( odell _ et al_. 1997a ) .    ",
    "the discovery of giant ( @xmath21 pc ) hh flows that challenge our ideas of the energetics and timescales involved in the star formation process ( reipurth _ et al_. 1997 ) .",
    "these giant hh flows are constituted of two or more hh objects that , in the past , were thought to be isolated .     the interest in studying jets which are photo - ionized by external sources such as the jet discovered in the trifid nebula ( cernicharo _ et al_. 1997 ) .",
    "this kind of jet have complex emission and kinematical properties which are now being studied theoretically .    with the aim of obtaining a global view on the kinematics of hh objects and jets in orion that allows us to search for large scale features that link",
    "the hh objects already known , we undertook the study of the inner 5 of the orion nebula by means of fabry - perot observations at h@xmath0 and [ nii](@xmath3 6583  ) . here",
    "we present some of the results derived from this study .",
    "the fabry - perot ( fp ) observations were carried out at the f/7.5 cassegrain focus of the 2.1 m telescope of the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir , b.c .",
    "( mxico ) using the unam scanning fabry - perot interferometer puma ( rosado _ et al_. 1995 ) .",
    "we used a 1024@xmath41024 thinned tektronix ccd detector , with an image scale of 0.59 arcsec  pixel@xmath1 .",
    "the interference filters used in the observations are centered at h@xmath0 and [ nii](@xmath3 6583  ) with bandpasses of 20 and 10  , respectively .",
    "the main characteristics of this interferometer are : interference order of 330 , free spectral range of 19.89   ( equivalent to a velocity range of 908 km  s@xmath1 ) and sampling spectral resolution of 0.41 (equivalent to 18.9 km  s@xmath1 ) , at h@xmath0 , achieved by scanning the interferometer gap at 48 positions .",
    "thus , the resulting data cubes have dimensions of 512@xmath4512@xmath448 .    with this setup ,",
    "we have obtained two nebular data cubes at h@xmath0 and [ nii ] with total exposure times of 48 and 144 min .",
    ", respectively .",
    "the data reduction and analysis were performed using the data reduction package cigale ( le coarer _ et al_. 1993 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the velocity map at @xmath5 = 127 km s@xmath1 ( i.e. ,   150 km s@xmath1 blueshifted relative to the velocity of the intense nebular background ) at h@xmath0 in which we have identified the different objects present in the inner 5 region of the orion nebula : the hh objects hh 202 , hh 269 ( barely seen at h@xmath0 ) , hh 203 and hh 204 , the e - w jet mentioned by odell _ et al_. ( 1997b ) . in what follows",
    ", we will describe some of our results on the kinematics of the hh objects hh 202 , hh 203 and hh 204 and discuss the possible existence of a large hh bipolar outflow .",
    "hh 202 was discovered by cant _ et al_. ( 1980 ) as an emission line object showing two knots embedded in an arc - shaped nebulosity .",
    "herbig & jones ( 1981 ) obtained proper motions for the knots , finding that the proper motion vectors were parallel and pointing towards the concave side of the curved shell and that there was a considerable dispersion in the tangential speeds of several of the knots : from 100 to 294 km s@xmath1 .",
    "more recently , odell _ et al_. ( 1997a ) have obtained wonderful hst images of the hh 202 region in the [ sii ] , h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] lines showing that the arc - shaped nebulosity is visible in [ sii ] , h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] lines .",
    "odell _ et al_. ( 1997b ) obtained [ sii ] and [ oiii ] fp spectroscopy of the trapezium region .",
    "they found a blueshifted portion of hh 202 that extends towards the nw .    from our fp work",
    "we see that hh 202 has a different morphology in h@xmath0 and in [ nii ] .",
    "figure 2 shows a close - up of the [ nii ] velocity map at @xmath5 =  90 km s@xmath1 showing the field near to hh 202 which is located at the nw corner . comparing with the h@xmath0 velocity map ( shown in figure 1 )",
    "we see that the hh 202 object itself has different morphologies at h@xmath0 and [ nii ] . indeed , while in [ nii ] we see the arc - shaped nebulosity ending to the sw in the southern knot , in h@xmath0 we detect , the arc - shaped nebulosity , but the southern knot is not easily disentangled from the emission of a bright nebulosity and several knots .",
    "instead , we see a bright head of irregular shape ( somewhat like an arrow head ) pointing in the e - w direction , with three faint filamentary extensions also oriented in the e - w direction .",
    "the longest filamentary extensions seem to form a rotated spur , or @xmath6 .",
    "another interesting feature revealed in figures 1 and 2 is that hh 202 seems to be part of a larger scale lobe ( of 82 `` @xmath4 25 '' and aperture angle of @xmath2 40 ) , oriented in the nw - se direction , ending at the position of hh 202 on one side , and in a point close to the e - w jet in its se end .",
    "the [ nii ] emission shows that , inside this lobe , two elongated cavities ( one of 35 `` @xmath4 9 '' and other of 55 `` @xmath4 12 '' , both with aperture angles of @xmath2 20 ) , somewhat similar to bow shocks are detected . in h@xmath0 ,",
    "the walls of the lobe are clearly seen but , the elongated cavities interior to the lobe ( hereafter called ` fingers ' ) , are confused with the bright background nebula .",
    "our fp data show that high internal motions of the known regions of hh 202 reach blueshifted velocities of up to 100 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the spur also shows this range of velocities indicating that it should belong to hh 202 . on the other hand , the lobe and the ` fingers ' inside it also have high blueshifted velocities reaching up to 100 km s@xmath1",
    "this shows that these new features are related to a high velocity flow , probably an hh flow , not catalogued as such because of the difficulties of disentangling it from the bright nebular background .",
    "it is unclear whether this flow is associated with hh 202 or whether it constitutes another hh system .",
    "these objects were discovered by munch & wilson ( 1962 ) .",
    "taylor & munch ( 1978 ) give radial velocities and velocity dispersions for several different features within these objects .",
    "however , it was cant _ et al_. ( 1980 ) who identified these objects as hh objects . hu ( 1996 )",
    "has measured tangential velocities of 0 and 70 km s@xmath1 for hh 203 and hh 204 , respectively , directed towards the apex of the bow .",
    "there are at least two important questions related to these objects : are hh 203 and hh 204 parts of the same object ? and , why does hh 204 show an asymmetry in its brightness distribution ? .",
    "our kinematical results show that :     hh 204 has a conical shape ( resembling a bow shock ) better appreciated at extreme heliocentric velocities : at @xmath5 = 50 km s@xmath1 and @xmath5 = + 45 km s@xmath1 .    ",
    "the apex of hh 204 has a complex velocity profile showing a splitting of the main velocity components ( at @xmath5 = 24 and + 20 km s@xmath1 ) and a blueshifted wing at @xmath5 = 120 km s@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the apex of hh 204 has the maximum blueshifted velocity of the region , in agreement with the predictions of bow shock models .",
    " hh 203 is more jet - like and it seems to be a different entity colliding with a lateral wall of hh 204 .",
    " we distinguish a pronounced asymmetry in brightness between the bow side of hh 204 near to the star @xmath7 a and the side located away from this star .",
    "henney ( 1996 ) has proposed that a transverse density gradient in the ambient medium where a bow shock propagates , could lead to an asymmetry in brightness of the bow shock .",
    "we find some evidence of a transverse density gradient because we find that there is a slight velocity gradient running perpendicular to the axis of hh 204 in the sense that the fainter regions have larger velocities .",
    " hh 203 and hh 204 seem to be part of a structure of large dimensions or lobe .",
    "indeed , figure 3 is a close - up of the [ nii ] velocity map at @xmath5 = 14 km s@xmath1 showing the field around hh 203 and hh 204 , which are located in the se of this figure .",
    "a careful inspection of this figure suggests the detection of an incomplete lobe ending in hh 204 on one side , and at the mark shown in figure 3 on the other side . this lobe is 132 \" or 0.29 pc long and it is more intense in its northern half .",
    "the possible existence of this lobe is also revealed in odell s image of the orion nebula published in the national geographic supplement ( grosvenor et al .",
    "our results show that hh 202 seems to be part of a larger scale lobe .",
    "this lobe is blueshifted relative to the main hii region velocity and shows the large internal motions characteristic of hh flows .",
    "the [ nii ] velocity cubes show that this lobe ( nw lobe ) is formed by two ` fingers ' starting from a region close to the e - w jet discovered by odell _ et al_. ( 1997a ) .",
    "hh 203 and hh 204 also seem to be part of a large structure or lobe ( se lobe ) of similar dimensions to the ones of the nw lobe .",
    "hh 204 is at one of the ends while the other end is located close to the e - w jet , as in the case of the nw lobe .",
    "furthermore , the se lobe shares the same orientation as the nw lobe . considering the results presented in the previous sections , we suggest that hh 202 and hh 203 - 204 , are part of a large bipolar outflow , 0.55 pc long , that arises from an object close to the e - w jet .",
    "besides , a preliminary analysis suggests that the nw lobe is blueshifted relative to the background nebula while the se lobe is redshifted .",
    "the measured proper motions of hh 203 - 204 agree with this interpretation while the proper motions measured a long time ago for hh 202 ( herbig & jones 1981 ) do not support this idea . on the other hand ,",
    "the region close to the e - w jet is so rich in objects that it is difficult to identify , by means of the existing stellar data , the object that could be the source of this suggested bipolar outflow .",
    "figure 4 shows the h@xmath0 velocity map at @xmath5 =  50 km s@xmath1 of the inner 5 of the orion nebula which allows us to have a global view of both lobes . at blueshifted velocities",
    "the nw lobe is better detected than the se lobe .",
    "however , jet - like features ( such as hh 203 and the ` fingers ' inside the nw lobe ) are detected inside these lobes .",
    "further studies of the stellar content close to the e - w jet and of proper motions of the hh 202 knots would be quite interesting for confirming or rejecting this suggestion .",
    "the authors wish to thank to alex raga for first suggesting the idea of studying the kinematics of the orion nebula with the puma equipment .",
    "they also wish to acknowledge the financial support from grants 400354 - 5 - 2398pe of conacyt and in104696 of dgapa - unam and from scholarships 124449 ( conacyt ) and dgep - unam .",
    "the authors also thank to alfredo daz and carmelo guzmn for the computer help ."
