    "an orientation on @xmath2 induces the counter clockwise ordering on the half edges of @xmath31 incident on each fixed vertex thus giving the abstract graph @xmath31 the structure of a _ fatgraph _ sometimes also called a ribbon graph . there is a combinatorial move on trivalent fatgraph spines @xmath30 called a _ flip _ as illustrated in figure [ flip0 ] , where one contracts an edge of @xmath31 with distinct endpoints and then expands the resulting 4-valent vertex in the unique distinct manner in order to produce another trivalent fatgraph spine .",

    "the super - teichmller space is of interest on its own as one of the higher teichmller theories associated with the simplest supergroup extension of @xmath91 , namely , the orthosymplectic group @xmath8 which is however special among supergroups in that its invariant bilinear form is non - degenerate .",
    "nevertheless , this should be the first step in a general approach to higher super teichmller theory as well as its quantization .",
    "notice that the symplectic or corresponding poisson structure of theorem b has constant coefficients opening the possibility of canonical quantization as in the bosonic case @xcite .",
    "furthermore just as for @xmath77-lengths in the bosonic case , our coordinates on decorated super - teichmller space provide a computationally effective description of super moduli geometry .",
    "another key reason for interest in the super - teichmller space is that it is a cornerstone of superstring perturbation theory , and the geometry of the supersymmetric moduli uncovered here is evidently more involved than its bosonic counterpart .",

    "this invariant @xmath108 of a pair @xmath109 of horocycles is called the _ lambda length _ , and these are the basic coordinates on @xmath93 .",

    "this construction evidently establishes a bijection between homotopy classes of trivalent fatgraph spines and homotopy classes of ideal triangulations of @xmath2 together with a natural identification between their edges .",
    "the dual of a flip , also called a flip , is the removal of an edge from @xmath110 with distinct triangles on either side followed by its replacement by the other diagonal of the quadrilateral formed by their union .",
    "a key point of the decorated space in the bosonic case is that the fiber @xmath112 of @xmath113 is identified with all @xmath114-tuples of ( lengths of ) horocycles in @xmath2 with one horocycle about each puncture ; this is precisely the sense in which a usual hyperbolic structure in @xmath5 is _ decorated with a horocycle at each puncture _ in @xmath93 .",

    "central projection of @xmath131 from @xmath132 to the disk at height zero establishes an isometry of @xmath131 and @xmath129 which continuously extends to the projection @xmath133 mapping @xmath103 to the center of the horocycle @xmath106 .",

    "this construction of @xmath144 and @xmath145 from lambda lengths is performed recursively as we shall recall in proving theorem b.    in our current case , there is an embedding of @xmath8 into the super lorentz group of the super minkowski space @xmath9 with pairing @xmath146 as described in the next section .",
    "there is again a positive light cone @xmath147 comprised of isotropic vectors so that the bodies of @xmath148 and @xmath149 are non negative .",
    "however , here is another fundamental distinction between the bosonic case and the general case treated here : whereas the action of @xmath137 on @xmath150 is transitive , an @xmath8-orbit of positive isotropic vectors is determined by a fermionic invariant @xmath151 up to sign . though most of the computations of this paper can be completed in the general setting , the super teichmller theory seems to require taking this fermion label @xmath152 .",
    "it is the special light cone @xmath153 consisting of those positive isotropic vectors with vanishing fermion label @xmath154 that provide the analogue of @xmath150 for us here .",
    "again , we define the @xmath77-length of a pair of points in @xmath155 to be the square root of their inner product and prove that this is the unique invariant of the @xmath8-orbit of a pair of linearly independent points in @xmath155",
    ".    we shall again recursively define a mapping @xmath156 which realizes @xmath77-lengths in the obvious sense and is @xmath140-equivariant with respect to the representation @xmath157 that we construct .",
    "here is yet another fundamental distinction between the bosonic case and the general case : whereas @xmath137 acts transitively on triples of rays in @xmath150 which are consistent with the positive orientation on @xmath7 , an @xmath8 orbit of a triple in @xmath155 whose underlying bosonic vectors in @xmath150 have this property is again determined by a fermion invariant @xmath158 up to sign .",
    "manin @xcite had already observed this basic phenomenon hence our term @xmath78-invariant for the odd invariants associated to vertices of a fatgraph spine in theorem b which come from consistent choices of signs and are , like @xmath77-lengths , realized by the mapping @xmath144 in the obvious sense .",
    "consistency here is given by an explicit relationship on signs of @xmath78-invariants for adjacent triangles in @xmath159 .",
    "there are thus three basic differences here from the bosonic case : the failure of transitivity of the @xmath8-action on points and on triples in @xmath155 already mentioned and the further fact that the identification of @xmath150 with the space of horocycles in @xmath131 has no known analogue in the general case .",
    "thus , the decorated super - teichmller space @xmath0 _ can only be defined here _ as the space of @xmath8 orbits of those maps @xmath156 that are @xmath140-equivariant for some super fuchsian representation with no intrinsic interpretation of _ super horocycle _ for the decoration beyond the analogous but un - illuminating affine dual in @xmath9 of a point in @xmath155 .",
    "indeed , in addition to the research frontiers discussed at the end of the previous section that the current work presumably illuminates , so also first glimpses of _ super hyperbolic geometry _ are hopefully to be gleaned here .",
    "the supergroup @xmath8 is defined as follows .",
    "the group elements are square @xmath160 supermatrices with superdeterminant equal to 1 which satisfy the relation @xmath161 where the superscript @xmath162 denotes the super transpose and @xmath163 .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix  i for more information about @xmath8 including the definition of super transpose ( or see ( [ action ] ) below ) and our sign conventions for products of supermatrices .",
    "the useful property @xmath164 is of course a direct consequence of ( [ ospdef ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the adjoint action of @xmath8 and to this end consider its even element @xmath165 we claim that the adjoint action @xmath166 of @xmath167 on @xmath168 leaves invariant @xmath146 since it is proportional to the quadratic form arising from the killing form of @xmath8 applied to @xmath168 .",
    "we shall prove this differently as follows .",
    "observe that in the 3-dimensional representation of @xmath8 owing to the property ( [ ainv ] ) , the element @xmath169 , where @xmath170 for any fixed constant @xmath171 , transforms as @xmath172 under the adjoint action .",
    "in particular when @xmath171 is invertible , this implies that the superdeterminant of @xmath173 is preserved under the action of @xmath8 sending @xmath174 to @xmath175 .",

    "<S> we introduce coordinates for a principal bundle @xmath0 over the super teichmller space @xmath1 of a surface @xmath2 with @xmath3 punctures that extend the lambda length coordinates on the decorated bundle @xmath4 over the usual teichmller space @xmath5 . in effect , the action of a fuchsian subgroup of @xmath6 on minkowski space @xmath7 is replaced by the action of a super fuchsian subgroup of @xmath8 on the super minkowski space @xmath9 , where @xmath8 denotes the orthosymplectic lie supergroup , and the lambda lengths are extended by fermionic invariants of suitable triples of isotropic vectors in @xmath9 . as in the bosonic case </S>",
    "<S> , there is the analogue of the ptolemy transformation now on both even and odd coordinates as well as an invariant even two - form on @xmath0 generalizing the weil - petersson khler form . </S>",
    "<S> this finally solves a problem posed in yuri ivanovitch manin s moscow seminar some thirty years ago to find the super analogue of decorated teichmller theory and provides a natural geometric interpretation in @xmath9 for the super moduli of @xmath0 . </S>"
