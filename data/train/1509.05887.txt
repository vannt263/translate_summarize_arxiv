    "<S> we calculate dilepton spectra in heavy - ion collisions using a coarse - graining approach to the simulation of the created medium with the urqmd transport model . </S>",
    "<S> this enables the use of dilepton - production rates evaluated in equilibrium quantum - field theory at finite temperatures and chemical potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> due to their penetrating nature , the invariant - mass and transverse - momentum spectra of dileptons are considered unique probes for the in - medium properties of hadrons in strongly interacting hot and dense matter , created in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dilepton - production rates are proportional to the electromagnetic current - correlation function of the source @xcite and thus provide insight into the corresponding excitations carrying the quantum numbers of the electromagnetic current . particularly from the restoration of chiral symmetry one expects substantial modifications of the spectral shape of this current - correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> particularly one hopes to gain insight into the microscopic realization of the chiral - symmetry restoration , e.g. , whether it is due to dropping in - medium hadron masses as predicted by the brown - rho - scaling conjecture or models implementing the vector manifestation of chiral symmetry or substantial broadening of the pertinent light - vector - meson spectral shapes due to hadronic interactions within the medium ( `` melting - resonance scenario '' ) as predicted by quantum - field - theoretical effective hadronic many - body theory ( for a review see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since the dileptons are produced and emitted undisturbed by final - state interactions during the entire evolution of the hot and dense medium , first a good understanding of all relevant microscopic sources of electromagnetic radiation in this medium is important .    for heavy - ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies , in the early hot stage the relevant degrees of the medium </S>",
    "<S> are quarks and gluons forming a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) close to local thermal equilibrium , as is inferred from the successful description of the hadronic bulk observables like @xmath0 spectra and angular anisotropies @xmath1 by hydrodynamical models for the evolving medium . here </S>",
    "<S> the main source of dileptons is the quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) . in the later stages of the fireball evolution ( or , in the case of heavy - ion collisions at lower energies , the entire evolution ) </S>",
    "<S> the medium is described as a hot hadronic gas . in the low invariant - mass range , @xmath4 the dilepton sources are thus hadronic and phenomenologically well described within a vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) model @xcite , i.e. , the assumption that the electromagnetic current of the hadrons is proportional to the light - vector meson field . </S>",
    "<S> this also implies that the electromagnetic transition form factors for the various dalitz decays of hadron resonances contributing substantially to the dilepton yield in the low - mass tail are describable within the vmd model . in the intermediate - mass range also </S>",
    "<S> `` multi - pion processes '' become relevant .     </S>",
    "<S> in+in collisions at the cern sps in ( a ) the low - mass ( lmr ) and ( b ) the intermediate - mass region ( imr ) in comparison to the data from the na60 collaboration @xcite . in the lmr </S>",
    "<S> the dilepton yield is dominated by the decays of the in - medium @xmath5 mesons ( dotted blue line ) and in the imr by qgp and multi - pion hadronic processes . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with a dilepton rate based on a thermal-@xmath5 contribution , neglecting the effect of baryon couplings , shows the importance of the these contributions for the tremendous broadening of the @xmath5-spectral function as well as the yield in the very - low - mass range close to the two - muon threshold . </S>",
    "<S> microscopically these contributions originate from dalitz decays of various baryon resonances . ]     </S>",

    "<S> microscopically these contributions originate from dalitz decays of various baryon resonances . ]    </S>",
    "<S> all these microscopic processes have to be evaluated in a hot and dense medium , which is at present available in detailed many - body quantum - field theoretical calculations only for a medium in thermal equilibrium , with some chemical off - equilibrium taken into account in terms of effective baryon densities and pion- as well as kaon - chemical potentials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been quite well established that the observed excess of low - mass dilepton production in heavy - ion collisions as compared to the expectations from the `` hadronic cocktail '' ( i.e. , from a simple scaling of the findings in pp collisions by the number of nucleon collisions in the nuclear reaction ) can be understood by effective hadronic models that predict a tremendous broadening of the light - vector mesons spectral shape with small mass shifts @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , one also has to describe the evolution of the hot and dense medium in a reliable way . </S>",
    "<S> this is usually done either by employing macroscopic descriptions , reaching from quite simple thermal - fireball parametrizations ( `` blast - wave fits '' ) @xcite to detailed ideal or viscous hydrodynamics simulations @xcite , or microscopic transport simulations @xcite .    in the latter approach </S>",
    "<S> it is challenging to fully implement the medium modifications of the partonic and hadronic dilepton sources . in our approach </S>",
    "<S> this problem is solved by mapping the kinetic description of the fireball evolution via monte - carlo transport simulations to a state close to local thermal equilibrium . in this work , an ensemble of collision events simulated by the urqmd model </S>",
    "<S> is used to calculate a coarse - grained energy - momentum tensor and net - baryon - number current on a space - time grid . </S>",
    "<S> then , using the eckart definition of the local rest frame , a temperature and baryo - chemical potential can be extracted via an equation of state ( eos ) , making use of a description of the energy - momentum tensor in terms of an anisotropic - fluid ansatz @xcite , where the pressure anisotropy , particularly relevant in the early stages of the fireball evolution , is taken into account . for the eos </S>",
    "<S> we match a parametrization of lattice - qcd results @xcite with a hadron - resonance gas eos @xcite , which match very well in the region of the parton - hadron transition around the critical temperature of @xmath6 .    in recent work @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have combined this coarse - graining method for the bulk - medium evolution of the strongly interacting fluid via the urqmd transport model with state - of - the art in - medium dilepton - production rates @xcite in order to evaluate the dilepton invariant - mass and @xmath0 spectra in @xmath7 in+in collisions as measured by the na60 collaboration at the cern sps and in @xmath8 ar+kcl and @xmath9 au+au collisions as measured by the hades collaboration at the gsi sis .    as exemplified by the comparison of the so calculated dimuon invariant - mass spectra in @xmath10 in+in collisions with the na60 data ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1 ] ) and corresponding dielectron invariant - mass spectra for @xmath11 ar+kcl collisions with data from the hades collaboration ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2 ] , left panel ) , the model successfully describes the data . in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2 ] we additionally provide our prediction for the @xmath12 au+au collisions as also measured by the hades collaboration .     and ( b ) for au+au at @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are normalized to the average total number of @xmath14 per event and shown within the hades acceptance . </S>",
    "<S> the results for ar+kcl are compared to the data from the hades collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the dilepton spectra between using the full model and omitting the contributions of direct baryon couplings to the @xmath5 and @xmath15 self - energies underlines the prevalence of the corresponding baryon - resonance dalitz - decay processes processes for the in - medium modifications of these vector mesons , shifting substantial spectral strength to the low - invariant - mass region . ]     and ( b ) for au+au at @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> both figures underline the importance of the interaction of the light vector mesons with baryons in the medium [ in the present model @xcite n(938 ) , @xmath16 , n(1440 ) , n(1520 ) , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , n(1720 ) , @xmath19 , n(2000 ) ] . as expected , these processes are prevalent at the low gsi - sis energy with high net - baryon densities but also relevant at cern - sps energies and even at higher rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the strong interaction is cp invariant and thus not the net - baryon density , @xmath20 , but the total baryon - antibaryon density , @xmath21 , is relevant for the in - medium modifications of the light - vector mesons spectral distributions .    in the near future </S>",
    "<S> we also plan to apply the model to dilepton production at rhic energies as well as photon production in heavy - ion collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank ralf rapp for providing the parameterization of the spectral function and many fruitful discussions . </S>",
