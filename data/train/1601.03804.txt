    "recently , the belle collaboration has reported the branching ratios of @xmath0 along with the first angular distribution asymmetries measured in the charmful three - body baryonic @xmath5 decays , given by  @xcite @xmath6 with the subscript @xmath7 as the angle between @xmath8 and @xmath9 moving directions in the @xmath10 rest frame , where @xmath11 represents the angular distribution asymmetry , with @xmath12 defined as the branching ratio of the positive ( negative ) cosine value . the data in eq .",
    "( [ data ] ) can be important due to the fact that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two of the few current - type processes among the richly observed baryonic @xmath1 decays , connected to the timelike baryonic form factors via the vector and axial - vector quark currents .",
    "note that although @xmath15 and @xmath16 are related to the timelike baryonic form factors , they also mix with the contributions from the scalar and pseudoscalar currents via the penguin diagrams .",

    "( [ data ] ) , the measured value of @xmath23  @xcite as the charmless counterpart is unexpectedly large .",
    "moreover , the experimental implication of @xmath24  @xcite looks mysterious as it breaks the isospin symmetry . since the decays of @xmath17 simply proceed through the ( axial)vector currents from the tree contributions , one suspects that @xmath25 is due to the additional ( pseudo)scalar currents from the penguin diagrams in @xmath26 .",
    "likewise , the charmless three - body baryonic decays of @xmath27 receive the main contributions from the tree and penguin diagrams , respectively , which may result in the wrong sign of @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "it is hence expected that @xmath29 from the tree - level diagrams can be more associated with @xmath30 . clearly , the systematic studies of the angular correlations in @xmath31 are needed .",
    "most importantly , since the theoretical approach for the three - body baryonic @xmath1 decays depends on the generalized factorization , according to the comments in ref .",
