    "in this work we perform use of the transverse expansion rate of clouds released from a highly oblate 2d potential as a probe of the _ in situ _ kinematics . as the magnetic field is left on after release , the @xmath23-wave scattering length remains high and the expansion takes place in the collisional regime .",
    "microscopically , this means that elastic collisions can occur during expansion which could redistribute energy from the radial motion into the transverse dimension , affecting the measured widths .",
    "it is therefore important to establish how significant this can be and what it means for the interpretation of our data . here",
    "we consider a ` worst - case scenario ' , to establish the largest effect that collisional dynamics could have on our data . by comparing this to our observations",
    "we readily see that the features in our data could not arise from collisions alone and must therefore originate from the _ in situ _ properties of the trapped cloud .    the expansion of both classical and quantum gases in the collisional regime can be described using a hydrodynamic picture @xcite .",
    "a quantitative simulation of the experiments here lies beyond the scope of this work , however , in certain limiting cases , it is possible to answer basic questions about the expansion of gases in the collisional regime . of relevance here , we can estimate how the energy transferred into the transverse dimension will scale with the total atom number @xmath11 , starting from an initially 2d cloud .",
    "specifically , we consider the expansion of a 2d gas after removing the transverse confinement with the magnetic field tuned to the pole of a feshbach resonance where the @xmath23-wave scattering length diverges and elastic collisions will be maximised .",
    "the amount of additional energy , @xmath100 , that can be transferred from the radial ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) dimensions to the transverse ( @xmath4 ) dimension in the expansion time @xmath56 will be set by ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the elastic collision rate and @xmath103 is the mean energy of particles in the radial dimension . at low temperature , @xmath104 ,",
    "@xmath103 will be determined by the 2d fermi energy , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the 2d density and @xmath20 is the atomic mass . in general",
    ", @xmath103 may be time - dependent , however , as we are only concerned with very short expansion times , @xmath107 , we make the conservative assumption that @xmath103 remains constant , i.e. that the radial kinetic energy is not significantly depleted via transfer into the @xmath4-dimension .",
    "once the transverse confinement has been removed atoms will collide in a 3d environment .",
    "moreover , as there now exists a continuum of transverse states available for particles to scatter into , pauli suppression will not play a role for collisions which transfer energy into the @xmath4-dimension .",
    "hence , we can use the classical expression for the elastic collision rate @xmath108 where the mean density is given by @xmath109 @xmath110 is the elastic collision cross - section and @xmath111 is the mean collision velocity . at the pole of the feshbach resonance @xmath112 where",
    "the mean collision wavevector @xmath113 is simply proportional to @xmath111 .",
    "( 2 ) then immediately gives @xmath114 .    during the short time",
    "@xmath56 the only time dependence in @xmath115 will stem from expansion along @xmath4 , as the radial density profile remains essentially static for times @xmath116 . to proceed , we make the conservative assumption that the time - dependence in @xmath115 is independent of the atom number , such that @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the initial mean density and @xmath119 is a time - dependent scaling function that describes evolution of the mean density along @xmath4 .",
    "while not necessarily exact , this assumption allows us to find an upper limit on @xmath100 due to collisions and also means we do not need to know the exact form of @xmath119 as we are only ever concerned with its integrated value that will be the same for all @xmath11 . the only term in eq .",
    "( 4 ) that is sensitive to the atom number is @xmath120 .    in an ideal gas",
    "we can evaluate @xmath115 analytically which , at @xmath62 , is proportional to @xmath121 .",
    "experimentally , we can determine @xmath120 for an interacting gas directly by integration over the 2d density profile according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) . from our data taken at the pole of the feshbach resonance ( 832 g )",
    "we find that the mean 2d density scales as @xmath122 for atom numbers below @xmath44 , due to the effect of interactions .    with this",
    "we arrive at a simple prediction for how the energy transferred from the radial to the transverse dimension scales with the atom number . as @xmath103 ( set by @xmath123 ) is proportional to the density , @xmath124 where we have used @xmath125 since , within our experimental uncertainties , the radial density has the same form for all atom numbers in the range considered here .    taking our measured scaling of @xmath120 with the atom number we find that the maximum amount of energy that can be transferred into the transverse expansion scales with the atom number to the power of @xmath126 .",
    "hence the growth of the mean cloud width @xmath55 goes with the square root of this energy such that we expect the strongest possible dependence to be @xmath127 .",
    "g for atom numbers @xmath128 .",
    "power law fit to this data which shows that the width grows as @xmath129.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we can compare this prediction with data from fig .",
    "3(a ) in the main paper .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "s1 above . also plotted is a free power law fit to the data ( blue line ) which yields @xmath130 .",
    "this is clearly a far stronger dependence on the atom number ( approximately five standard deviations larger ) than the predicted @xmath131 scaling from elastic collisions alone .",
    "we emphasise that , in arriving at this prediction , we assumed that the transverse width evolves independently of the atom number which we know from our data not to be the case . in reality",
    "we see that the density drops more rapidly for higher atom numbers which reduces the number of collisions during expansion such that the true @xmath11-dependence would be weaker than this .",
    "this analysis shows that , even though elastic collisions during expansion are expected to play a role , these alone can not account for the increased cloud widths we observe .",
    "furthermore , while the effects of collisions will vary with the magnetic field , we expect that they will remain qualitatively similar on the bcs side of the feshbach resonance .",
    "this power - law behavior is entirely inconsistent with the existence of a plateau for small atom numbers that we observe experimentally .",
    "we therefore conclude that our results provide clear evidence for the departure from 2d kinematics due to vibrationally excited atoms or molecules that were present in the trapped cloud .",
    "here we present a theory for the expansion of the two - body ground state initially prepared in our two - dimensional trap , where the atoms are tightly confined in the transverse ( @xmath4 ) direction , with weak radial confinement in the @xmath132 plane .",
    "we numerically calculate the two - body width @xmath133 after the transverse confinement is removed and the cloud expands for time @xmath134 when the magnetic field is varied across the feshbach resonance .    here",
    ", we make the assumption that the atoms are confined in a purely harmonic potential , which means the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "motion becomes decoupled from the relative motion and we can treat the two components separately .      the c.m .",
    "expansion represents a simple one - dimensional problem along the @xmath4-axis . at very low temperature @xmath9 ( @xmath135 ) , where @xmath136 is the large transverse trap frequency , the two atoms should initially occupy the c.m .",

    "the hamiltonian for the relative motion is @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the relative coordinate , and @xmath150 is the interatomic interaction , which we simply treat as a contact interaction . by solving the schrdinger equation for the relative - motion ,",

    "when the confinement along @xmath4 is switched off , the relative motion is described by the hamiltonian @xmath163 and the eigenvalue problem can be solved by following the route of yurovsky and olshanii @xcite .",

    "[ figs2 ] we plot the transverse width of the expanded two - body state as a function of the magnetic field across the feshbach resonance .",
    "note that to compare this with @xmath174 considered in the experiments we need to divide eq .",
    "( 25 ) by @xmath175 which is based on the two - particle variance .",
    "the two - body width shrinks quickly to the tightly - bound limit on the bec side of the resonance , where the main contribution is from the c.m .",
    "thus , far enough below the feshbach resonance , the two - body width becomes insensitive to the magnetic field . above the resonance",
    "the width grows but remains below the ideal atomic gas limit in this range of interactions .",
    "after release , the weak harmonic confinement in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane remains on and is included in the calculations so the strict two - body ground state is very weakly bound even after removing the transverse confinement .",
