    "a review of the extensive literature on this model see derrida @xcite .",
    "a significant step forward in the understanding of the mathematical aspects of the model was made with the realization , by derrida et al @xcite , that a stationary state solution , @xmath12 , of the master equation could be determined by the matrix product ansatz @xmath13 with normalisation factor @xmath14 given by @xmath15 provided that @xmath16 and @xmath17 satisfy the dehp algebra    [ algebra ] @xmath18    these equations are sufficient to determine @xmath19 but derrida et al @xcite also gave several interesting matrix representations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 , any one of which may be used to determine @xmath19 .    the primary result of this paper is to show that each of the three matrix representations of the dehp algebra can be interpreted as a transfer matrix for a different weighted lattice path problem .",
    "this then allows the normalisation , correlation function and other properties of the asep model to be interpreted combinatorially as certain weighted lattice path configuration sums  see section 2 .",
    "one of the path connections is similar to that discussed in derrida et .",
    "@xcite    the lattice path interpretation has two primary consequences : the first is that it provides a starting point for a new method ( the `` constant term '' or ct method ) for calculating the normalisation and correlation functions  see section 3 .",
    "this reproduces several existing results ( but by a new method ) and also provides several new results .",
    "one of note , the `` @xmath0-expansion '' , arises from a rearrangement of the constant term expression which leads to form of the normalisation in terms of the variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the coefficients in this expansion are catalan numbers , the asymptotic form of which enables a uniform approach to computing the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath14 as @xmath24 in the various phases of the asep model  see section 5 .",
    "the results agree with those found in @xcite , by steepest descent methods .",
    "a bonus following from the lattice path interpretation of the algebra representations is that one of the lattice path interpretations ( a slight variation of representation 3 ) has a natural interpretation as a polymer chain having a two parameter @xmath25 interaction with a surface . in this context",
    "@xmath14 is a partition function for the `` two - contact '' polymer model  see section 4 .",
    "we also obtain recurrence relations ( on the length variable ) for the partition function of this polymer model and hence also for the asep normalisation .",
    "the second primary consequence of the lattice path interpretation follows from the ct method itself , as the ct method has very natural combinatorial interpretations . for example",
    ", the normalisation can be written in several different polynomial forms depending on which variables you use : @xmath26 where all the polynomial coefficients , @xmath27 , are integers .",
    "( all the variables in these polynomials are related by simple equations eg .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 etc .",
    " see above and in later sections ) .",
    "since , in each of these cases , the normalisation arises from a weighted lattice configuration sum , all the above coefficients have a direct combinatorial interpretation as enumerating a particular subset of the paths ( eg .  those with exactly @xmath30 steps with the first weight and exactly @xmath31 steps with the second weight ) .",
    "however , we show that each of the above polynomial coefficients has an alternative combinatorial interpretation which corresponds to enumerating a different , _ unweighted _ , set of lattice paths eg .   in @xcite",
    "the coefficient , @xmath32 was given as @xmath33 which , with a simple rearrangement , can be seen to be a particular `` ballot number '' @xmath34 where @xmath35 enumerates ballot paths ( see section 3.1 for details ) of length @xmath10 and height @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath37 which enumerates a special set of paths with @xmath30 weights of type @xmath38 and @xmath39 weights of type @xmath40 is seen to be determined in terms of the much simpler combinatorial problem of enumerating _ unweighted _ ballot paths of length @xmath41 and height @xmath42 .",
    "this correspondence between between the two combinatorial problems ( one pair for each coefficient ) arises as a bijection between the two path problems .",
    "this result may be turned around : if a bijection between a particular ballot path problem and the weighted path problem can be proved then it provides an alternative derivation of the normalisation polynomial .    finally , in section 6 , the recurrence relations for the asep correlation functions derived in @xcite are shown to follow from the lattice path interpretations .",
    "the coefficients of the terms in the recurrence relation are also seen to be various ballot numbers .",
