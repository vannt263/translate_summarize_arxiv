    "wormholes , as well as black holes , are an extraordinary consequence of einstein s equations of general relativity . during recent",
    "last decades , there has been a considerable interest in the field of wormhole physics .",
    "two separate directions emerged : one relating to euclidean signature metrics  @xcite and the other concerned with lorentzian ones .",
    "the interest has been focused on traversable lorentzian wormholes ( which have no horizons , allowing two - way passage through them ) , and were especially stimulated by the pioneering works of morris , thorne and yurtsever  @xcite , where static , spherically symmetric lorentzian wormholes were defined and considered to be an exciting possibility for constructing time machine models with these exotic objects , for backward time travel ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "most of the efforts are directed to study static configurations that must have a number of specific properties in order to be traversable .",
    "the most striking of these properties is the violation of energy conditions .",
    "this implies that the matter supporting the traversable wormholes is exotic  @xcite , which means that it has very strong negative pressures , or even that the energy density is negative , as seen by static observers .",
    "however , one can also consider time - dependent wormhole configurations , such as rotating wormholes  @xcite or evolving wormholes in a cosmological background  @xcite .",
    "lower  @xcite and higher dimensional wormholes have also been considered by several authors .",
    "euclidean wormholes have been studied by gonzales ",
    "diaz and by jianjun and sicong  @xcite for example .",
    "the lorentzian ones have been studied in the context of the n  dimensional einstein theory  @xcite or einstein  gauss  bonnet theory of gravitation  @xcite .",
    "evolving higher dimensional wormholes also have been studied  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical construction of wormhole geometries is usually performed by using the method where , in order to have a desired metric , one is free to fix the form of the metric functions , such as the redshift and shape functions , or even the scale factor for evolving wormholes . in this way",
    "one may have a redshift function without horizons , or with a desired asymptotic .",
    "unfortunately , in this case we can obtain expressions for the energy and pressure densities which are physically unreasonable .",
    "in this paper we shall follow the conventional method for finding solutions in general relativity , and used also in theoretical cosmology",
    ". we shall prescribe the matter content by specifying the equations of state of the radial and the tangential pressures and then we solve the einstein field equations in order to find the redshift and shape functions together with the scale factor .",
    "specifically we shall consider that these pressures obey barotropic equations of state with constant state parameters .",
    "in other words , we shall find all evolving wormhole geometries which have the radial and the tangential pressures proportional to the energy density .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review some important aspects of static wormholes and give the definition of evolving wormholes . in sec .",
    "iii we find the metric of evolving wormholes with pressures obeying barotropic equations of state with constant state parameters . in sec .",
    "iv the properties of the obtained wormhole geometry are studied .",
    "we use the metric signature ( @xmath1 ) and set @xmath2 .",
    "before treating evolving lorentzian wormholes let us review the static ones .",
    "the metric ansatz of morris and thorne  @xcite for the spacetime which describes a static lorentzian wormhole is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the redshift function , and @xmath5 is the shape function since it controls the shape of the wormhole .",
    "morris and thorne have discussed in detail the general constraints on the functions @xmath5 and @xmath4 which make a wormhole  @xcite :    constraint 1 : a no  horizon condition , i.e. @xmath6 is finite throughout the space  time in order to ensure the absence of horizons and singularities .",
    "constraint 2 : the shape function @xmath5 must obey at the throat @xmath7 the following condition : @xmath8 , being @xmath9 the minimum value of the @xmath10coordinate . in other words",
    "@xmath11 .    constraint 3 : finiteness of the proper radial distance , i.e. @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 ) throughout the space  time .",
    "this is required in order to ensure the finiteness of the proper radial distance @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 the @xmath16 signs refer to the two asymptotically flat regions which are connected by the wormhole .",
    "the equality sign in  ( [ r finito ] ) holds only at the throat .",
    "constraint 4 : asymptotic flatness condition , i.e. as @xmath17 ( or equivalently , @xmath18 ) then @xmath19 .",
    "notice that these constraints provide a minimum set of conditions which lead , through an analysis of the embedding of the spacelike slice of  ( [ 4wormhole ] ) in a euclidean space , to a geometry featuring two asymptotically flat regions connected by a bridge .",
    "although asymptotically flat wormhole geometries have been extensively considered in the literature , one can study however other asymptotic behaviors that are worth considering .",
    "for instance asymptotically anti ",
    "de sitter wormholes may be also of particular interest  @xcite .",
    "we shall consider a simple generalization of the original morris and thorne metric  ( [ 4wormhole ] ) to a time - dependent metric given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "note that the essential characteristics of a wormhole geometry are still encoded in the spacelike section .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath22 and @xmath23 the metric  ( [ evolving wormhole ] ) becomes the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , and as @xmath24 it becomes the static wormhole metric  ( [ 4wormhole ] ) .    in general , in order to construct an evolving wormhole",
    ", one has to specify or determine the red  shift function @xmath4 , the shape function @xmath5 and the scale factor @xmath21 .",
    "so , one of them may be chosen by fiat and the others may be determined by implementing some physical conditions .",
    "for example in ref .",
    "@xcite an exponential scale factor is considered in order to explore the possibility that inflation might provide a natural mechanism for the enlargement of an initially small ( possibly submicroscopic ) wormhole to macroscopic size . in ref .",
    "@xcite also different choices for the scale factor @xmath21 are considered and the constraints are found on the minimum values of the throat radii .    in this paper",
    "we shall require that @xmath25 in order to have a family of evolving lorentzian wormholes conformally related to another family of zero  tidal force static wormholes , and to ensure that there is no horizon .",
    "we also shall require that the radial tension , which is the negative of the radial pressure , and the pressure measured in the tangential directions ( orthogonal to the radial direction ) have barotropic equations of state with constant state parameters .",
    "these simple choices will permit us to find explicit analytical expressions , by solving the einstein field equations , for the shift and shape functions , the scale factor , and the energy and pressure densities .",
    "in order to simplify the analysis and the physical interpretation ( with @xmath25 ) we now introduce the proper orthonormal basis as @xmath26 where the basis one  forms @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 these basis one  forms are related to the following set of orthonormal basis vectors defined by @xmath29 this basis represents the proper reference frame of a set of observers who always remain at rest at constant @xmath10 , @xmath30 , @xmath31  @xcite .    for these basises the only nonzero components of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor @xmath32 are precisely the diagonal terms @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which are given by @xmath37 where the quantities @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are respectively the energy density , the radial pressure , the radial tension per unit area , and lateral pressure as measured by observers who always remain at rest at constant @xmath10 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "thus for the spherically symmetric wormhole metric  ( [ evolving wormhole ] ) , with @xmath25 , the einstein equations are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and an overdot and a prime denote differentiation with respect to @xmath45 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "now we shall require that the radial tension and the lateral pressure have barotropic equations of state .",
    "thus we can write @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are constant state parameters .",
    "clearly , the requirement  ( [ c00 ] ) with @xmath49 allows us to connect the evolving wormhole spacetime  ( [ evolving wormhole ] ) with the standard frw cosmologies , where the isotropic pressure density is expressed as @xmath50 , with constant state parameter @xmath51 ( = @xmath49 ) .",
    "now , using the conservation equation @xmath52 , we have that @xmath53 which may be interpreted as the conservation equation and the relativistic euler equation ( or the hydrostatic equation for equilibrium for the matter supporting the wormhole ) respectively . from these equations",
    "we see that for @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 , we have the standard cosmological conservation equation @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , so if we want to isotropize the pressure with a barotropic equation of state and constant state parameters , then we can not have a pressure of the form @xmath58 , it will depend only on time @xmath45 .    now , with the help of the conservation equation and the relativistic euler equation we can easily solve the einstein equations  ( [ 00])([thetatheta ] ) . from the structure of these conservation equations",
    "we see that one can write the energy density in the form @xmath59 .",
    "thus from the conservation equation we obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an integration constant . now taking into account eq .",
    "( [ c00 ] ) , from eq .",
    "( [ ce2 ] ) we have that @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an integration constant . thus from expressions  ( [ rhot ] ) and  ( [ rhor ] ) we can write for the energy density @xmath64 where we have introduced a new constant @xmath65 in order to redefine the integration constants @xmath61 and @xmath63 .",
    "now , by subtracting eqs .",
    "( [ rr ] ) and  ( [ thetatheta ] ) , and using eq .",
    "( [ 00 ] ) , we obtain the differential equation @xmath66 clearly , from this equation we conclude that if we want to have a solution for the shape function @xmath67 we must constrain the state parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the following manner : @xmath68 thus obtaining for the shape function @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a new integration constant .",
    "now , from eqs .",
    "( [ 00 ] ) ,  ( [ rho ] ) ,  ( [ br ] ) and taking into account the constraint  ( [ constraint ] ) we find that the scale factor is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an integration constant , obtaining the following final expression for the energy density  ( [ rho ] ) : @xmath73 notice that in principle one would expect the scale factor to have the form @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a constant , but the field equations constrain this constant to be @xmath76 .",
    "thus the self  consistent solution for constant state parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ scf ] ) ,  ( [ br ] ) and  ( [ rhofinal ] ) , so obtaining for the line element  ( [ evolving wormhole ] ) the following wormhole metric : @xmath77 in this case the constraint  ( [ constraint ] ) implies that the radial and tangential pressures are given by @xmath78 so the energy density and pressures satisfy the following relation : @xmath79 note that there is another branch of spherically symmetric solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ 00])([thetatheta ] ) . by adding these equations and taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ c00 ] ) and  ( [ rho ] ) we obtain the equation @xmath80 which implies that we must take @xmath54 , thus obtaining from eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) that @xmath81 and , for the scale factor @xmath82 , i.e. the standard frw solution for an ideal fluid with @xmath83 .",
    "one interesting aspect to be considered is the possibility of sustaining a traversable wormhole in spacetime via exotic matter made out of phantom energy .",
    "the latter is considered as a possible candidate for explaining the late time accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite .",
    "this phantom energy has a very strong negative pressure and violates the null energy condition , so becoming a most promising ingredient to sustain traversable wormholes .",
    "notice however that in this case we shall use the notion of the phantom energy in a more extended sense since , strictly speaking , the phantom matter is a homogeneously distributed fluid , and here it will be an inhomogeneous and anisotropic fluid  @xcite , since @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "now we shall discuss the above obtained analytical solution . to start with",
    ", we shall consider first the static case .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath86 ( without any loss of generality we can set @xmath87 ) we have a static spherically symmetric spacetime . from the condition for the throat that the @xmath10coordinate has a minimum at @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath11 , we obtain for the integration constant @xmath88 , yielding for the shape function and the energy density @xmath89 respectively . in this case",
    "the metric is given by @xmath90 the radial coordinate @xmath10 has a range that increases from a minimum value at @xmath9 , corresponding to the wormhole throat , to infinity . from eqs .",
    "( [ whstatic ] ) and  ( [ evolving wormhole final estatico ] ) we can see that for a matter content with a radial pressure having a phantom equation of state , i.e. @xmath91 , we have an asymptotically flat wormhole with a positive energy density .",
    "this static wormhole solution is a traversable one and was firstly considered in ref .",
    "for @xmath92 we also have an asymptotically flat wormhole spacetime , but in this case the energy density is negative everywhere .",
    "let us now explore the features of the evolving wormhole .",
    "we shall consider the time interval @xmath93 for the evolution . in order to maintain the lorentzian signature we must require that @xmath94 ; if @xmath95 the signature of the spacetime changes to a euclidean one , obtaining an evolving euclidean wormhole .",
    "clearly , in order to have an evolving wormhole , as in the static case , we must require @xmath96 or @xmath97 , yielding in both these cases that @xmath98 . thus we conclude that the phantom energy can support the existence of evolving wormholes .",
    "now it can be shown that for @xmath99 and @xmath100 the metric component @xmath101 of the line element  ( [ evolving wormhole final ] ) is equal to zero for some value of the radial coordinate .",
    "effectively , from the formulated above constraints on the parameters , i.e. @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we have that @xmath105 at the vicinity of @xmath106 , while its first derivative @xmath107 .",
    "this implies that for any @xmath108 we have always a growing @xmath109 .",
    "thus we conclude that for some @xmath110 we have @xmath11 , implying that at the location @xmath111 is the throat of the wormhole .",
    "so , from the condition @xmath112 , we obtain for the integration constant @xmath113 yielding for the shape function , the metric component @xmath114 and the energy density @xmath115 respectively .",
    "let us now enumerate some characteristic properties of the found evolving wormhole geometry :    \\(i ) the weak energy condition ( wec ) for the energy ",
    "momentum tensor  ( [ emt ] ) reduces to the following inequalities @xmath116 for all ( t , r ) . by using the expressions  ( [ c00 ] ) and  ( [ constraint ] ) we can rewrite the wec as follows @xmath117 thus for @xmath102 the first and third inequalities of  ( [ wec ] ) are satisfied , while the second one is violated .",
    "so , as one would expect , these evolving wormholes , supported by an anisotropic phantom energy , do not avoid the violation of the wec .",
    "\\(ii ) the general form of the evolving wormhole solution implies that there is only the standard coordinate singularity at the throat , although for any @xmath0 const , the radial proper length between any two points @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xmath120 with @xmath121 , is required to be finite everywhere .",
    "there are , however , no spatial and temporal curvature singularities ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the energy density also is well behaved since at @xmath123 it is given by @xmath124 .",
    "a temporal singularity occurs at @xmath125 only for the case with @xmath126 .",
    "\\(iii ) from eq .",
    "( [ acceleration ] ) and the constraint  ( [ constraint ] ) we conclude that the expansion of the wormhole is not accelerated .",
    "so this family of evolving wormholes , supported by an anisotropic phantom energy , expands with a constant velocity . note that from eq .",
    "( [ pr pl ] ) we have that if @xmath102 then always @xmath127 , while @xmath128 .",
    "\\(iv ) from the metric  ( [ evolving wormhole final ] ) we can see that for wormholes supported by phantom matter at spatial infinity ( @xmath129 ) we have the following asymptotic metric : @xmath130 this metric has slices @xmath0 const which are spaces of constant curvature .",
    "this implies that the asymptotic metric  ( [ wormhole asintotico ] ) is foliated with spaces of constant curvature .",
    "so the form of the @xmath10dependent part of this metric may induce us to think that we have a four dimensional spacetime of constant curvature , implying that we have not an asymptotically flat wormhole .",
    "namely , since we have that @xmath104 , we would have an asymptotically anti ",
    "de sitter spacetime .",
    "however , if we calculate the riemann tensor for the metric  ( [ evolving wormhole final ] ) we find that its independent non ",
    "vanishing components are @xmath131 from these expressions we see that at spatial infinity these components vanish for a wormhole supported by a phantom matter",
    ". since the energy density  ( [ rhofinal ] ) also vanishes for @xmath132 thus we have an asymptotically flat evolving wormhole .",
    "notice that we obtain such an asymptotic behavior since the integration constant @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ br ] ) finally is constrained by the field equations to appear also in the general expression for the scale factor  ( [ scf ] ) .",

    "since the wormhole  ( [ evolving wormhole final ] ) evolves in time , each such slice will be different for different values of time .",
    "in other words , the shape of the wormhole is determined also by the scale factor @xmath21 .",
    "however , it can be shown that the form of the wormhole is preserved with time , by using an embedding procedure .",
    "the metric of a such a wormhole slice for @xmath145 const is given by @xmath146 where @xmath5 is given by the first expression of eq .",
    "( [ whevolving ] ) .",
    "one may rewrite this slice by rescaling the radial coordinate as @xmath147 .",
    "thus the metric  ( [ 35 ] ) may be rewritten in the following form : @xmath148 where we have introduced the definition @xmath149 .",
    "now , we shall embed this slice in a flat @xmath141dimensional euclidean space @xmath142 , which we shall write as @xmath150 comparing the metrics  ( [ 36 ] ) and  ( [ 37 ] ) we conclude that @xmath151 this implies that the evolving wormhole will remain the same size in the @xmath152 coordinates .",
    "on the other hand , we also conclude that in order to visualize the slice @xmath143 , @xmath144 embedded into the three - dimensional euclidean space we must require that the shape function @xmath5 must be positive and be such that @xmath153 in order to guarantee that the root @xmath154 be real , as for static wormholes  @xcite . in other words we can draw the graph @xmath155 only for @xmath153 with @xmath156 . in this case",
    "the embedded two dimensional section has a minimum radius at the throat @xmath111 and has the maximum upper radius at the mouth ( @xmath157 ) of the wormhole . for larger radii where @xmath158 the embedding process is no longer valid .",

    "thus the requirement @xmath159 emphases the fact that the importance of the embedding is near the throat of the wormhole . in our case ,",
    "as we stated above , far from the wormhole mouth the space is asymptotically flat . in principle , if one includes a cosmological constant , the space can be de - sitter or anti - de sitter far from the mouth .    now in order to maintain the shape of the traversable wormhole the flaring out condition must be required , i.e. @xmath160 . so from eq .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) we have that @xmath161 and taking into account the form of the shape function from eq .",
    "( [ whevolving ] ) we obtain @xmath162 which for @xmath104 is always positive , thus satisfying the flaring out condition for the entire range of the radial coordinate @xmath10 .",
    "so , as we have seen , a distribution of an anisotropic phantom energy provides the flare - out conditions for the throat of evolving wormholes .",
    "\\(vi ) let us now study the range of validity of the radial coordinate more adequately . from the condition @xmath163 , which we must impose in order to have a good embedding , we obtain that @xmath164 for @xmath165 implying that @xmath166 for @xmath167 .",

    "notice that the radius @xmath139 may be made arbitrarily large by taking @xmath169 , but still having an evolving wormhole .",
    "\\(vii ) in order for this evolving wormhole to be traversable , the tidal forces experienced by a traveller must not be too great .",
    "so a traveller should feel during its radial journey a tidal acceleration , between two parts of her body ( i.e. head to feet ) , which must not exceed by much one earth gravity .",
    "this traversability criteria was considered in ref .  @xcite . in general",
    "the tidal acceleration may be written as ( the greek indices take the values @xmath170 ) @xmath171 where the vector @xmath172 denotes the separation between the head and feet of the traveller s body , so @xmath172 is a spacelike vector .    in order to calculate the tidal acceleration felt by a traveller",
    "we introduce the orthonormal reference frame used by her : @xmath173 . since in this frame",
    "we have that @xmath174 and @xmath175 for the four velocity , and additionally the riemann tensor is antisymmetric in its first two indices , the tidal acceleration is purely spatial with components ( the latin indices take the values @xmath176 ) @xmath177 where the spacelike vector @xmath178 may be oriented along any spatial direction in the traveller s frame .",

    "the vector @xmath184 points along the direction of travel ( towards increasing radial proper distance @xmath185 ) .",

    "<S> contrary to the standard wormhole approach , where first a convenient geometry is fixed and then the matter distribution is derived , we follow the conventional approach for finding solutions in theoretical cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an analytical evolving wormhole geometry by supposing that the radial tension ( which is negative to the radial pressure ) and the pressure measured in the tangential directions have barotropic equations of state with constant state parameters . at spatial infinity </S>",
    "<S> this evolving wormhole , supported by this anisotropic matter , is asymptotically flat , and its slices @xmath0 constant are spaces of constant curvature . during its evolution </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the wormhole expands with constant velocity , i.e without acceleration or deceleration , since the scale factor has strictly a linear evolution . </S>"
