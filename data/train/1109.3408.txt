    "we show that certain eigenfunctions are `` expelled '' from the branch , i.e. , their amplitude along the branch decays exponentially fast . a similar `` expulsion '' effect is well known in optics and acoustics : a wave of wavelength @xmath1 can not freely propagate inside a rectangular channel of width @xmath2 smaller than @xmath3 because of the exponential attenuation @xmath4 along the channel @xcite .",

    "it is worth noting that the exponential decay of eigenfunctions of schrdinger operators in free space ( so - called strong localization ) has been thoroughly investigated in physical and mathematical literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the first exploration of this problem for arbitrary schrdinger potential bounded from below was given by schnol @xcite who proved an exponential decay of eigenfunctions in which the decay rate was related to the distance between the corresponding eigenvalue and the essential spectrum .",
    "this result is of remarkable generality because the essential spectrum may be arbitrary , for example with gaps , and may not consist of positive axis .",
