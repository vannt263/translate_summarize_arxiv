    "although the standard models of particle physics and cosmology have proven spectacularly successful , they together require 31 free parameters ( table  ) . why we observe them to have these particular values",
    "is an outstanding question in physics .",
    "this parameter problem can be viewed as the logical continuation of the age - old reductionist quest for simplicity .",
    "realization that the material world of chemistry and biology is built up from a modest number of elements entailed a dramatic simplification .",
    "but the observation of nearly one hundred chemical elements , more isotopes , and countless excited states eroded this simplicity .",
    "the modern @xmath3 standard model of particle physics provides a much more sophisticated reduction .",
    "key properties ( spin , electroweak and color charges ) of quarks , leptons and gauge bosons appear as labels describing representations of space - time and internal symmetry groups .",

    "all current cosmological observations can be fit with 5 additional parameters , though it is widely anticipated that up to 6 more may be needed to accommodate more refined observations ( table  ) .",
    "table   expresses some common quantities in terms of these 31 fundamental ones in table  , only fermions with mass below @xmath6 should be included . ] , with @xmath7 denoting cruder approximations than @xmath8 .",
    "many other quantities commonly referred to as parameters or constants ( see table   for a sample ) are not stable characterizations of properties of the physical world , since they vary markedly with time @xcite .",
    "for instance , the baryon density parameter @xmath9 , the baryon density @xmath10 , the hubble parameter @xmath11 and the cosmic microwave background temperature @xmath12 all decrease toward zero as the universe expands and are , de facto , alternative time variables .",
    "table  : input physical parameters.[multiblock footnote omitted ] those for particle physics ( the first 26 ) and @xmath13 appear explicitly in the the lagrangian , whereas the cosmological ones ( the last 11 ) are inserted as initial conditions . the last six are currently optional , but may become required to fit improved measurements .",
    "the values are computed from the compilations in @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "table   summarizes the constraints that we have discussed above .",
    "those not superseded by other stronger ones are also illustrated in , with @xmath14 fixed at its observed value .",
    "let us briefly comment on how they all fit together .",
    "the first key point to note in is that the various constraints involve many different combinations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , thereby breaking each other s degeneracies and providing interesting constraints on both @xmath16 and @xmath15 separately .",
    "the fragmentation constraint ( requiring disk instability ) constrains @xmath16 alone when @xmath14 is given whereas there are constraints on @xmath15 alone from both line cooling freezeout and primordial black hole trouble .",
    "the encounter and cooling constraints both have different slopes ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ) because they involve different powers of the baryon fraction . whereas the nonlinear halo constraint depends on the total halo density @xmath19 , the encounter constraint depends on the halo baryon density @xmath20 . the cooling constraint ( which is equation ( 11 ) in @xcite after changing variables to reflect the notation in this paper ) comes from equating the cooling timescale ( given by the inverse of the baryon density @xmath20 ) and the dynamical timescale ( given by the total density as @xmath21 , thus constraining the combination @xmath22 .",
    "the second key point in is that this combination of constraints reverses previously published conclusions about @xmath15 . where we should expect to find ourselves in depends on the priors for both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "recall that halos form only above whichever dotted line corresponds to the @xmath13-value .",
    "if the prior for @xmath13 is indeed uniform , then it is _ a priori _ ( before selection effects are taken into account ) 1000 times more likely for the halo constraint to be the upper dotted line than the middle one , and this is in turn 1000 more likely than the bottom dotted line . in other words , marginalizing over @xmath13",
    "relentlessly pushes us towards the upper right in , towards larger value of @xmath23 .",
    "this means that if @xmath16 is fixed and only @xmath15 can vary across the ensemble , marginalizing over @xmath13 pushes things towards the triangle at _ larger _",
    "this `` smoothness problem '' was pointed out in @xcite and elaborated in @xcite , suggesting that unless the @xmath24 falls off as @xmath25 or faster , it is overpowered by the selection effect and one predicts a clumpier universe than observed ( the star in should be shifted vertically up against the edge of the encounter constraint , to the triangle ) .",
    "shows that if @xmath16 too can vary , marginalizing over @xmath13 instead pushes things towards _",
    "@xmath15 , to the square , since this gives the greatest allowed halo density @xmath19 . in @xcite , it was found that certain low - energy inflation scenarios naturally predicted a rather flat priors for @xmath26  to determine whether they are ruled out or not thus requires more detailed modeling of the effect of the dark matter density on galaxy formation and encounters .",
    "table   illustrates that ( except for one rather unimportant logarithm ) , all constraints we have considered correspond to hyperplanes in the 7-dimensional space parametrized by ( , , , , q , , ) , providing a simple geometric interpretation of the selection effects . this means that if all priors are power laws , the preferred parameter values are determined by solving a simple linear programming problem , and will generically correspond to one of the corners of the convex 7-dimensional allowed region .",
    "above we have frequently used such sharp inequalities to help build intuition for the underlying physics . for future extensions of this work , however , it should be borne in mind that such inequalities are not necessarily sufficient to capture the key features of the problem , and that they can either overstate or understate the importance of selection effects .",
    "the ultimate goal is to test theories by computing the predicted probability distribution from , and almost no selection effects @xmath27 correspond to sharp cutoffs resembling a heaviside step function .",
    "some ( like the halo constraint ) are exponential and thus able to overpower any power law prior .",
    "others , however , may be softer , and it is therefore crucial to check whether their functional form falls of faster than than the relevant prior grows  if not , the `` constraint '' will be penetrated , and the most likely parameter values may lie in the allegedly `` disallowed region '' .",
    "conversely , if @xmath28 is rather flat in a large `` allowed region '' , then the most likely parameter values can lie well inside it , far from any edges , since it corresponds to the peak of the probability distribution rather than its edge .",
    "we have discussed predictions for the 31-dimensional vector @xmath29 of dimensionless physical constants in the context of `` ensemble theories '' producing multiple hubble volumes ( `` universes '' ) between which one or more of the parameters can differ .",
    "the prediction is the probability distribution of , where neither of the two factors is optional .",
    "although it is generally difficult to evaluate either one of the terms , it is nonetheless crucial : if candidate theories involve such ensembles , they are neither testable nor falsifiable unless their probabilistic predictions can be computed .",
    "although many scientists hope that @xmath30 in will be a multidimensional dirac @xmath31-function , rendering selection effects irrelevant , to elevate this hope into an assumption would , ironically , be to push the anthropic principle to a hedonistic extreme , suggesting that nature must be devised so as to make mathematical physicists happy .",
    "we must therefore face some difficult questions both about what , in principle , to select on , and how to quantitatively calculate that selection effect .",
    "for both statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics , it proved challenging to correctly predict probability distributions .",
    "if the analogous challenge can be overcome for theories predicting dimensionless constants , they too will become testable in the same fashion . the fact that we can only observe once",
    "is not a show - stopper : a single observation of a vertically polarized photon passing through a polarizer @xmath32 from vertical would rule out quantum mechanics at @xmath33 confidence .",
    "the outstanding difficulty is therefore not a  philosophical \" problem that we can not observe the full ensemble , but rather that we generally do not know how to compute the theoretical prediction @xmath34 .",
    "we have tackled this problem quantitatively for a particular example where both factors in computable : that of axion dark matter with its phase transition well before the end of inflation",
    ". we found that @xmath35 , , that the prior dark matter distribution has no free parameters even though the axion model itself does .",
    "we saw that this useful predictability gain has the same basic origin as that of the zero - parameter ( flat ) @xmath13-prior of @xcite : the anthropically relevant range over which @xmath36 is non - negligible is much smaller than the natural range of @xmath30 , so only a particular property of @xmath30 matters .",
    "for the famous @xmath13-case , the natural @xmath30-range involves either the supersymmetry - breaking scale or the planck scale @xmath37 whereas the relevant range is @xmath38 , so the property that @xmath39 is smooth on that tiny scale implies that it is for all practical purposes constant . for our @xmath16-case ,",
    "the natural @xmath30-range is @xmath40 where @xmath41 lies somewhere between the inflation scale and the planck scale , whereas the relevant range is much smaller , so the only property of @xmath42 that matters is its asymptotic scaling as @xmath43 .    in computing the selection effect factor @xmath44",
    ", we took advantage of the fact that none of these parameters affect chemistry or biology directly .",
    "we could therefore avoid poorly understood biochemical issues related to life and consciousness , and could limit our calculations to astrophysical selection effects involving halo formation , galaxy , solar system stability , the same simplifying argument has been previously applied to @xmath13 and the neutrino density ( , @xcite ) .",
    "we discovered that combining various astrophysical selection effects with all three parameters @xmath45 as variables reversed previous conclusions ( ) , pushing towards lower rather than higher @xmath15-values . in particular , we found that one can reach misleading conclusions by simply taking @xmath36 to be the matter fraction collapsing into halos , neglecting the fact that very dense halos limit planetary stability .",
    "in particular , we found that if we impose a stiff upper limit on the density of habitable halos , the predicted probability distribution for the dark matter density parameter ( ) can be brought into agreement with the measured @xmath16-value for reasonable assumptions , , that the pre - inflationary axion model is a viable dark matter theory .",
    "suppose that supersymmetry were to be discovered at the large hadron collider , indicating the existence of a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) with a relic density approximately equal to the observed dark matter density , , with @xmath46 .",
    "there would then be a strong temptation to declare the dark matter problem solved . based on our results , however",
    ", that would be quite premature !    as detailed in , it is not implausible that the function @xmath47 to be taken as input to the astrophysics calculation is a sharply peaked function whose relative width is much narrower than that of @xmath48 , perhaps only a few percent .",
    "this situation could arise if the fundamental theory predicted a broad prior only for the @xmath49-parameter in table   ( which controls the higgs vacuum expectation value ) , since this may arguably be determined to within a few percent from selection effects in the nuclear physics sector , notably stellar carbon and oxygen production .",
    "if the pre - inflationary axion model is correct , we would then have = + , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 would be for all practical purposes a constant .",
    "this gives @xmath52 for @xmath53 , zero otherwise , and the testable prediction becomes this times the astrophysical factor selection effects factor @xmath48 that we have discussed . repeating the calculation of @xcite , this implies that we should expect to find roughly comparable densities of wimp and axion dark matter .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "removing the assumption that @xmath47 is sharply peaked does not alter this qualitative conclusion .",
    "this conclusion would also hold for any other axion - like fields that were energetically irrelevant during inflation , even unrelated to the strong cp - problem .",
    "more generally , string - inspired model building suggests the possibility that multiple species of `` gimps '' ( gravitationally interacting massive particles that do not couple through the electromagnetic , weak or strong interactions ) may be present . according to recent understanding , their presence may be expected for modular inflation , though not for brane inflation @xcite . if such particles exist and have generic not - too - extreme priors ( falling no faster than @xmath54 and rising no faster than the selection effect cutoff ) , then our anthropic constraints on the sum of their densities again predict a comparable density for all of species of dark matter that have a rising prior @xcite .",
    "even before the lhc turns on , more careful calculation of the astrophysical selection effects determining @xmath36 could give interesting hints .",
    "if the constraints on dense halos turn out to be rather weak so that the improved version of predicts substantially more axion dark matter than observed , this will favor an alternative model such as wimps where @xmath55 is so narrow that @xmath56 is effectively determined non - anthropically . alternatively , if remains consistent with observation , then it will be crucial to follow up an initial lhc susy or other wimp detection , if it occurs , with detailed measurements of the relevant parameters to establish whether the wimp density accounted for ( which a linear collider might , in favorable cases , pinpoint within a few percent @xcite ) is exactly equal to the cosmologically measured dark matter density , or whether a substantial fraction of the dark matter still remains to be accounted for .    the authors wish to thank ed bertschinger , douglas finkbeiner , alan guth , craig hogan , andrei linde and matias steinmetz for helpful comments , and sam ribnick for some earlier , exploratory calculations .",

    "in this appendix , we derive a variety of fitting functions used in the paper , explicitly highlighting the dependence of standard cosmological structure formation on the dimensionless parameters @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath57 .",
    "since some of our approximations are quite accurate , we retain the exact numerical coefficients where appropriate .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the function ( x)x^1/3 ^ -1/3 , where @xmath59 and 1.43728 , describes how , in the absence of massive neutrinos , fluctuations in a @xmath60 @xmath61cdm universe grow as the cosmic scale factor @xmath62 as long as dark energy is negligible ( @xmath63 for @xmath64 ) and then asymptote to a constant value as @xmath65 and dark energy dominates ( @xmath66 as @xmath67 ) .    including the effect of radiation domination early on but ignoring baryon - photon coupling , the total growth factor is well approximated by @xcite g(x)1 + 32 ^ -1/3(x ) , which is accurate to better than 1.5% for all @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "in essence , fluctuations grow as @xmath69 between matter domination ( @xmath70 ) and dark energy domination ( @xmath71 ) , giving a net growth of @xmath72 .",
    "shows that they grow by an extra factor of 1.5 by starting slightly before matter domination and by an extra factor @xmath73 by continuing to grow slightly after dark energy domination .",
    "let us now simplify this result further . from the definition of @xmath16 , the matter density can be written @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the number density of photons . the latter is given ( in planck units ) by the standard black body formula = 2(3)^2 t^3,(3)1.20206 .",
    "the corresponding standard formula for the energy density is = ^215 t^4 for photons and = 218(411)^4/30.68132 for three standard species of relativistic massless neutrinos .",
    "the matter - radiation equality temperature where @xmath76 is thus = 30(3)^4 ^ -10.220189 , measured to be about @xmath77 in our hubble volume . since @xmath78 , we thus obtain = ^14230 ^ 3(3)^4 ^ 3 ^4 384.554 ^4 the above relations are summarized in tables   and  . in all cases of relevance to the present paper , the growth factor @xmath79 , allowing initial fluctuations @xmath80 to grow enough to go nonlinear .",
    "we can therefore drop the first term in , obtaining the useful result g(x)&&452 ^ 1/3(3)^4/3 ^ 14/3 ^ -1 ^ 4/3 ^ 1/3(x ) + & & 0.206271 ^4/3 ^ 1/3(x ) .",
    "the fluctuation amplitude @xmath82 in a sphere of radius @xmath83 are given by @xcite ^2 = 4 _",
    "0^ ^2 p(k ) k^2 dk(2)^3 , where @xmath84 .",
    "we are interested in the linear regime long after the relevant fluctuation modes have entered the horizon , when all modes grow at the same rate ( assuming a cosmologically negligible contribution from massive neutrinos as per @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath82 can be factored as a product of a function of time @xmath68 and a function of comoving scale : = q g(x ) s ( ) . here @xmath15 is the amplitude of primordial fluctuations created by , , inflation , defined as the scalar fluctuation amplitude @xmath85 on the horizon . as our measure of comoving scale , we use the dimensionless quantity ^2 m , where @xmath86 is the comoving mass enclosed by the above - mentioned sphere .",
    "the horizon mass at matter - radiation equality is of order @xmath87 , so @xmath57 can be interpreted as the mass relative to this scale .",
    "this equality horizon scale is the key physical scale in the problem , and the one on which the matter power spectrum has the well - known break in its slope .",
    "( fluctuation modes on smaller scales entered the horizon before equality when they could not grow ) . for reference , the measured vales from wmap+sdss give @xmath88 , @xmath89 solar masses and @xmath90 for a sphere of comoving radius @xmath83 .",
    "numerically , using and employing @xcite to compute @xmath91 , we find that the scale - dependence @xmath81 is approximately given by s()^1/ , where @xmath92 .",
    "this assumes that the primordial fluctuations are approximately scale - invariant and that massive neutrinos have no major effect , as indicated by recent measurements @xcite . for our observed @xmath16-value a galactic mass scale @xmath93",
    "thus corresponds to @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "again using measured parameter values , the common reference scale @xmath96 corresponds to @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we will now derive the virial density of a halo formed at time @xmath68 in a @xmath61cdm universe , generalizing the standard result @xmath100 .",
    "whereas past work on this subject @xcite has focused on accurate numerical fits to the observationally relevant present epoch and recent past ( @xmath101 ) , we need a formula accurate for all times @xmath68 .",

    "the fit ( x)(9 ^ 24x + 6.6x^0.3 + 2 ) is accurate to better than 4% for all @xmath68 and also becomes exact in both limits , but we will nontheless use the less accurate because it is analytically invertible and still accurate enough for our purposes . applying the virial theorem",
