    "we further discuss the _ irac _ power - law sources and other agn present in our sample in section  [ sec_agn ] .",
    "before performing different spectral line diagnostics , we did some general inspection of the qualitative and quantitative spectral characteristics of our @xmath0galaxies .",
    "each individual zcosmos spectrum covers the observed wavelength range @xmath33 and has a dispersion of @xmath66 .",
    "the quality of the spectra is quite uniform up to wavelengths @xmath67 . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the quality is degraded by fringing , which can become quite severe in some cases beyond @xmath68 .",
    "as we explain later , we only perform line measurements on individual spectra at @xmath69 , and all the measurements between @xmath70 and @xmath71 have been manually checked on an individual basis .",
    "stacked spectra can give a good qualitative idea of the mean optical spectra of @xmath0galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig_stack1 ] , [ fig_stack2 ] and [ fig_stack3 ] show the rest - frame average stacked spectra of our @xmath0galaxies with @xmath61 , @xmath62and @xmath9 , respectively , in different redshift bins .",
    "we constructed the stacked spectra on sets of 38 to 89 galaxies , depending on the redshift and ir luminosity bin .",
    "the zcosmos blagn have been excluded for the stacking .",

    "we only show the spectra up to rest - frame wavelengths corresponding to observed @xmath73 $ \\sim$}}~}8500 \\ , \\aa$ ] , i.e. we excluded the regions most affected by fringing .",
    "however , as we show in section  [ sec_line ] , even the longest wavelength regions show reasonably good average spectra when sufficient numbers of sources are stacked .",
    "this is due to the fact that the fringing pattern adds incoherently for different sources , so no systematic noise is propagated into the average stacked spectra .",
    "we obtained the average spectrum in each bin by re - normalising the individual rest - frame spectrum of each source to the average value of a featureless region of the continuum ( which was chosen depending on the redshift bin ) . in this way , all the individual spectra in a given redshift and ir luminosity bin are put on a same scale before stacking .",
    "we smoothed out regions lying on top of the main atmospheric absorption lines , except when source emission lines were present . at each rest - frame wavelength , we excluded the 5% smallest and largest values before computing the average .",
    "this sigma - clipping procedure helps to clean the stacks for possible remaining spurious lines in the individual spectra .",
    "these average spectra of @xmath0galaxies in different redshift and ir luminosity bins show that :    * as expected , all emission lines characterising star - forming galaxies are present .",
    "we note that these emission lines are a property of the average spectra of ir galaxies , but we do not necessarily observe all these lines in every spectrum on an individual basis ( because e.g. they are much extincted by reddening in some cases ) . on the average spectra , we also see some absorption lines characteristic of old stellar populations , as nad or caii h & k. this means that different generations of stars are present in many ir galaxies . *",

    ", they do not contain information about the variety of strengths of the spectral features among @xmath0galaxies in a same redshift and luminosity bin .",
    "we measured the fluxes and equivalent widths ( ew ) of emission lines in our zcosmos spectra by direct integration on the rest - frame spectra .",
    "we do not measure emission lines lying beyond observer - frame @xmath71 , to avoid being severely affected by fringing . for lines at observer - frame @xmath75",
    ", we manually checked the measurements on an individual basis using the iraf package ` splot ' .",
    "we also checked manually those lines lying on top of or near strong atmospheric absorption features , e.g. @xmath34 \\ , \\lambda 3727 \\,$]at @xmath76 .",
    "in all the following , except when otherwise stated , we only present and analyse line measurements when the corresponding rest - frame ew are @xmath77 , as those are the lines with the most secure measurements .",
    "the error bars have been computed as the sum of two components .",
    "the first error - component has been obtained by considering the variations of the continuum in a narrow region around the line and setting this to a minimum of 5% . on the other hand , @xmath48 of the sources on which we performed line measurements",
    "have duplicate good - quality spectra .",
    "we used these repeated line measurements to work out a second component for the error bars .",
    "the error bars computed in the first step have been then systematically shifted , in such a way that their median values coincided with the medians derived from the analysis of duplicates .",
    "the systematic percentual errors we added to the line fluxes are 12 , 15 , 12 , 9 and 12% for @xmath34 \\ , \\lambda 3727 \\,$ ] , @xmath5 , @xmath8 \\ , \\lambda 5007 \\,$ ] , @xmath4and @xmath78 \\ , \\lambda 6584 \\,$ ] , respectively .",
    "for the ew measurements , the systematic percentual errors added are 17 , 20 , 17 , 10 and 18% .",
    "all balmer emission lines have been corrected for stellar absorption . to do this , we fitted the continuum of each spectrum with synthetic stellar sed from the bruzual & charlot 2007 library ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ; bruzual 2007 ) .",
    "the medians of the stellar absorption corrections for @xmath4and @xmath5 in our galaxies are , respectively , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    in addition , we applied aperture corrections to all the spectral lines , as the slits in the vimos masks have a width of 1 arcsec .",

    "even galaxies with comparable ir luminosities at similar redshifts have lines whose ew differ , in some cases , by a factor 5 or more .",
    "there is a wide range of possible @xmath4ew values for galaxies with @xmath61up to @xmath85 .",
    "this is probably a spatial sampling effect , because the vimos slit only samples a small region of 1 arcsec width . within a star - forming galaxy , different regions such as hii nuclei",
    ", hotspots or disk hii regions are characterised by different @xmath4ew distributions ( e.g. kennicutt et al .",
    "1989 ) . at low redshifts ,",
    "these different regions can be resolved and they can individually dominate the optical light collected in the 1 arcsec - wide slit .",
    "in contrast , given the size of the _ mips _ psf at @xmath0(@xmath86 arcsec ) , the ir luminosity corresponds to the ir light in the integrated galaxy .",
    "the large dispersion in ew is not seen anymore for @xmath5at higher redshifts , where the different regions can not be resolved ( see figure [ fig_ewc ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath8 \\ , \\lambda 5007 \\,$]ew do span a wide range of values at these higher redshifts , indicating the existence and different importance of ionising sources in ir galaxies .",
    "when all the ultra - violet ( uv ) light produced by young stars in a star - forming galaxy is absorbed and re - emitted by the surrounding dust , the ir bolometric ( @xmath87 ) luminosity @xmath59is directly related to the sfr ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "sometimes , however , part of the light produced by young stars is not absorbed and can directly be observed at uv wavelengths ( for a discussion see e.g. , buat et al .  2007 ) .",

    "several conclusions can be extracted from inspection of figure [ fig_sfr ] .",
    "firstly , the general trend observed is that the derived sfr are @xmath104 .",
    "as reddening is larger at uv than at optical wavelengths ( and even larger than at ir wavelengths ) , this trend appears to be a consequence of the differential dust extinction .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the sfr obtained from @xmath5are in better agreement with the uv - only sfr than those derived from @xmath4(see left - hand side panels of figure [ fig_sfr ] ) .    for galaxies with @xmath61at @xmath7 , the observed @xmath4line produces a sfr that is typically a factor @xmath395 below the total ( ir+uv ) sfr .",
    "the differences are more dramatic when using the @xmath5line : for galaxies with @xmath62at @xmath84 , the sfr are underestimated by a factor @xmath105 .",
    "this indicates that the effects of dust extinction are very important in most ir sources .",
    "this is consistent with the results of previous spectroscopy studies of ir - luminous galaxies ( e.g. flores et al .",
    "2004 ; liang et al .  2004 ; choi et al .",
    "the exact factors obtained for the optical - to - total sfr conversion mainly depend on the recipes adopted to convert mid - ir into bolometric ir luminosities .    for some galaxies in our sample , especially among the @xmath9population ,",
    "the discrepancies between the @xmath5-derived and total sfr are much larger than the average ( @xmath44 $ \\sim$}}~}50 $ ] )",
    ". this could indicate the presence of either very - obscured star - forming galaxies or the presence of agn which are to some extent responsible for the ir emission .",
    "we note that , although we excluded from this analysis all the zcosmos identified blagn , narrow - line agn or mixed agn / star - forming systems might still be present in our sample .",
    "we mentioned in section [ sec_rflum ] the existence of some _ irac _ power - law sources within our sample .",
    "however , only one of the sources with highly discrepant sfr is actually an _ irac _ power - law . in some other cases , high ionisation line ratios",
    "are observed in their optical spectra . as we will discuss in section [ sec_young ] , star formation and",
    "agn activity might coexist in some of these systems .",
    "the discrepancies between the sfr derived from the emission lines in the optical spectra and the ( ir+uv ) indicators make necessary the study of dust extinction in our galaxies .",
    "the common procedure in the literature is to adopt a known reddening law to deredden the optical spectra . either the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the milky way ( mw ; fitzpatrick 1999 and references therein ) or the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; prvot et al .",

    "the latter quantity is related to the extinction at uv wavelengths @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath112 ( assuming a uniform geometry for the dust distribution ; see e.g. buat et al .",
    "2002 ) . to estimate the far - ir contribution",
    ", we used the rest - frame @xmath113 luminosity , which we compute based on the rest - frame @xmath0luminosities and assuming the @xmath53-@xmath114 relation calibrated by bavouzet et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the different thick colour lines indicate the relations obtained from different reddening laws .",
    "we see that both the mw and the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reddening laws produce basically the same curve .",
    "this is because of the following : we assumed that the observed @xmath4-to-@xmath5luminosity ratio is given by    @xmath115    i.e. the intrinsic case b recombination line ratio attenuated by the corresponding difference of extinctions .",
    "the extinction @xmath116 is proportional to the reddening @xmath117 , and thus    @xmath118    this means that the attenuation on @xmath119 is given by the slope of each reddening curve between the @xmath4-@xmath5and the 2000 @xmath14 spectral regions .",
    "as the mw reddening law is characterised by the presence of a graphite bump around @xmath120 that is absent in the calzetti et al .",
    "law , it might seem surprising that both curves in figure [ fig_redd ] are nearly coincident .",
    "this is due to the wavelengths we considered to study the attenuation : the slopes of the two reddening laws are basically the same between these precise wavelengths .",
    "if we had used a different uv wavelength for our analysis , the two curves would be slightly different .",
    "both the mw and the calzetti et al .",
    "reddening laws appear to correctly describe the average extinction observed in our @xmath0galaxies , within the error bars .",
    "the smc law , instead , has a quite flatter slope and tends to underestimate the observed @xmath119 ratio .",
    "so , to deredden the spectral lines in our galaxies , we decided to adopt the calzetti et al .",
    "reddening law , but the mw law should also be suitable for the @xmath5-to-@xmath4spectral region ( as , in practice , the region of the graphite bump is convolved with the nuv filter response function , so we are not sensitive to this structure ) .",
    "we observe in figure [ fig_redd ] that six galaxies in our sample display @xmath119 ratios that are equal to or lower than the case b recombination , but at the same time have significantly large @xmath121 ratios .",
    "five out of six of these galaxies are secure one - to - one @xmath0-zcosmos identifications , so this behaviour is not due to incorrect associations .",
    "the @xmath119 ratios of these sources can neither be explained by a linear combination of two components , one completely free of dust ( in a case b recombination ) and the other one following e.g. the calzetti et al .",
    "reddening law ( dot - dashed green line in figure [ fig_redd ] ) .    instead , the behaviour of the six outlier sources is probably the combination of two factors : 1 ) at @xmath106 , the 1-arcsec wide vimos slits only cover a small region within the galaxies and 2 ) the dust is not homogeneously distributed ; in particular , the optical spectra map regions where the uv / optical photons can escape with virtually no absorption .",
    "the _ hst / acs _ @xmath40-band images show that all five cases with secure identifications are galaxies with a bright optical nucleus and a quite fainter disky structure around ( see figure [ fig_stamps ] ) .",
    "this fainter structure is probably extincted by dust , which is itself responsible for the ir emission .",
    "the remaining sixth case corresponds to a merger , and the ir emission is likely to be produced by the dust surrounding the two merging galaxies .    except for these few cases with resolved internal regions ,",
    "the application of a single reddening law should be suitable for the majority of our galaxies .",
    "although sources with non - homogeneous dust distributions might also be present at higher redshifts , the possibility of resolving different regions within a single galaxy is much less likely .",
    "figure [ fig_av ] shows the @xmath122-band extinctions derived for different ir luminosity galaxies at different redshifts in our sample , assuming the validity of the calzetti et al .",

    "supernovae - driven outflows are also known to effectively remove metals from a galaxy ( e.g. dalcanton  2007 ) but it seems implausible that this mechanism alone can explain the under - abundance observed in ir galaxies ( see the discussion in rupke et al .",
    "more likely , a combination of the two phenomena could have taken place at the same time .",
    "thus , gas mixing produced by inflows and outflows during the ir phase could temporarily move galaxies appart from the mass - metallicity relation .",

    "this fact indicates that the sensitivity limit of the @xmath0survey is not the only factor that determines the ir detection of these sources .",
    "other physical differences might mean that some blagn are not ir - detected , even when lying at lower redshifts than others that are detected .    within the unification scheme for agn ( antonucci  1993 )",
    ", broad lines are present in the spectra when the source is oriented face - on and the central gas clouds are visible .",
    "the surrounding dusty torus is responsible for the ir emission .",
    "the flux at ir wavelengths depends on the incoming flux of uv photons from the central engine , so it is related to the amount of material accreted onto the central black hole .",

    "the distribution of @xmath0luminosities @xmath53of these galaxies compared to the distribution of luminosities for the blagn is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig_agn ] .",
    "it is clear from these two distributions that the blagn in our sample are considerably more luminous in the ir than the most powerful narrow - line agn .",
    "the fact that all of the identified most - luminous ir agn are blagn might be partially due to the optical magnitude cut limiting the zcosmos - bright survey .",

    ". the prevalence of blagn among the most - luminous ir galaxies detected in zcosmos - bright could also be consequence of the orientation effect : in blagn , the optical nucleus is more exposed than in edge - on - oriented active sources .",

    "30 out of 45 of these sources are also zcosmos - bright blagn . to inspect whether the remaining 15 irac power - law sources had also an independent signature of agn activity , we looked for counterparts of these sources in the x - ray catalogues for the cosmos field ( hasinger et al .",
    "we found that 11 out of 15 of the irac power - law sources not identified as zcosmos blagn are detected in x - rays .",

    "all these characteristics suggest that most of the irac power - law sources which are not individually identified with zcosmos blagn are either narrow - line agn or composite agn / starburst systems .",

    "in fact , the existence of young stars is expected in galaxies that are ir - selected , i.e. that are selected to have on - going star formation . however , an old ( @xmath189 ) galaxy with on - going declining star formation displays quite redder colours .",
    "the fact that @xmath182 is invariably small indicates that ir galaxies either are young systems or are experiencing a rejuvenation of their stellar content .",

    "we then measured @xmath15 only on average stacked spectra , for which the signal - to - noise ratio is much higher .",
    "we constructed 11 composites corresponding to galaxies of similar ir luminosities in narrow redshift bins between @xmath190 and 1.0 .",
    "each composite is the average of 17 to 32 individual spectra , depending on the case .    to correct the @xmath15 ew for line filling",

    ", @xmath191 is within the fringing - affected region of our spectra and its measurement becomes quite uncertain .",

    "ir galaxies occupy , on average , a well - defined place in the @xmath15 ew - @xmath182 diagram .",
    "the ideal single constant sfh is consistent with the average location of some ir galaxies but , still in this case , the associated ages are very young ( @xmath194 ) . for most ir galaxies , however , the track of a constant sfh is well above their location in the @xmath15 ew - @xmath182 diagram .",
    "the locus of ir galaxies in the @xmath15 ew - @xmath182 plane can , instead , be well explained by secondary bursts of star formation ( thin solid lines in figure [ fig_secb ] ; see also hammer et al .",
    "2005 ; marcillac et al .",
    "these secondary bursts only need to form an additional minor amount ( 5 - 10% ) of stellar mass in these galaxies to produce the @xmath15 ew and @xmath182 values observed . here",
    "we confirm that such a scenario can explain the average properties of the brightest ir galaxies found all the way from redshifts @xmath190 through 1.0 .",
    "two additional interesting conclusions can be extracted from figure [ fig_secb ] : firstly , the small @xmath182 values and relatively small @xmath15 ew displayed by some composites indicates that the rejuvenation of the stellar populations occurs , in many cases , in relatively old ( @xmath189 ) galaxies .",
    "we know that , at @xmath52 , lirgs and ulirgs are generally associated with intermediate - to - large stellar mass galaxies ( @xmath195 $ \\sim$}}~}1 \\times 10^{10 } \\ , \\rm m_{\\odot}$ ] ; see caputi et al .",
    "so , the brightest ir emission at these redshifts is being hosted by galaxies which already formed most of their stellar mass at earlier epochs .",
    "secondly , the average location of our sources on the @xmath15 ew - @xmath182 plane strongly constrains when the ir phase is being produced : on average , galaxies are ir bright in the elapsed time between @xmath16 and @xmath17 years after the onset of the secondary burst .",
    "we note that our results do not completely exclude the possibility that some galaxies have more prolonged ir phases characterised by more or less constant sfr .",
    "galaxies that still have sufficiently large gas reservoirs remaining at @xmath52 could in principle sustain the typical sfr of lirgs ( @xmath196 ) for some longer times .",
    "however , given the already - assembled stellar masses of lirgs and ulirgs , this situation is probably implausible in most cases .",
    "most of the dust contained in ir galaxies is produced by agb stars , which start to inject dust into the interstellar medium only a few hundreds of myr after the production of the burst ( e.g. dwek  2005 ) .",
    "the fact that the ir phase occurs between @xmath16 and @xmath17 years after the onset of the secondary burst indicates that the dust being heated during the ir phase is probably ` old dust ' , i.e. dust that has been created by previous generations of stars .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the bulk of the ir phase in galaxies at @xmath52 is observed , on average , @xmath197 years after the onset of a secondary burst of star formation .",
    "the minimum average time for the detection of the ir phase is in part simply due to the lower rate of galaxies that can be detected in shorter ( @xmath198 yr ) elapsed times .",
    "but , if this were the only factor determining the rate of detection of younger starbursts , one would possibly expect to find around one out of ten ir galaxies being at the earliest stages of a new burst of star formation .",
    "we looked for galaxies with signatures of young ( @xmath198 yr ) starbursts in their optical spectra within our @xmath0sample .",
    "at early stages of star formation , the ew of absorption features associated with high - order balmer lines is expected to be small ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig_secb ] ) .",
    "in addition , star formation should be sufficiently strong as to clearly detect even the higher - order balmer lines in emission ( except , maybe , for extremely - obscured sources ) . as we explained in section [ sec_irph ] , the typical ew widths measured for @xmath15 on different spectra are , in general , small and the associated errors quite large as to consider these measurements on an individual basis . in spite of this , we used these tentative measurements of @xmath15 to look for candidate galaxies to be hosts of very young starbursts .",
    "we found four likely candidates for young starbursts within our @xmath0sample .",
    "the spectra of all of these galaxies are characterised by the presence of @xmath15 and @xmath199 in emission .",
    "one case also shows a slightly broad heii line ( see example in figure [ fig_young ] ) , which is a signature of stellar winds originated in wolf - rayet stars in young - starburst galaxies ( schaerer et al .",

    "still , these presumably young starbursts seem to be quite less than @xmath3910% of our galaxy sample .",
    "this fact suggests that the onset of the ir phase within @xmath200 yr after the burst might be indeed a rare phenomenon .",
    "of course , given the optical magnitude cut of the zcosmos survey , we can not exclude that ir galaxies at the very earliest stages of a rejuvenating starburst are more common among optically faint sources .",

    "as expected , at low @xmath7 redshifts , our sample is dominated by ir - normal galaxies ( in our classification , strictly , @xmath61 ) .",
    "the optical spectra of these sources display a large variety of emission - line ew and ratios .",
    "this is in part due to a spatial sampling effect , because the 1-arcsec - width vimos slit maps only the central region within each galaxy , which in some cases is not representative of the entire galaxy .",
    "the same effect has been observed in the study of low - redshift _ iras _ galaxy optical spectra .",
    "but the variety of spectral characteristics also reveals the different physical conditions of the hosts of normal ir galaxies .",
    "this class includes galaxies with different degrees of chemical evolution and already - assembled stellar masses : from some low - mass , low - metallicity galaxies to many already massive , chemically enriched , galaxies .    at higher redshifts",
    ", we studied the variation of the ionisation levels in different luminosity ir galaxies , through their @xmath8 \\",
    ", \\lambda 5007 \\,$]/@xmath5line ratios .",
    "we found that the average @xmath8 \\ , \\lambda 5007 \\,$]/@xmath5ratio for @xmath9galaxies at @xmath204 is more than 0.6 dex higher than the average ratio of all zcosmos galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "this allows us to conclude that ulirgs have distinct optical spectral properties when compared to typical optically - selected sources .",
    "in particular , for some of our galaxies , we find very high @xmath141@xmath8 \\ , \\lambda 5007 \\,$]@xmath142@xmath5@xmath153 ratios , comparable to those of sub - millimetre galaxies at @xmath205 .",
    "these are cases where massive star formation and narrow - line agn activity are likely to coexist . near or mid - ir spectroscopy is necessary to provide further information on the ionisation source in these galaxies .    around @xmath167 of the galaxies for which we could derive metallicities at @xmath13 are unambiguously below the general mass - metallicity relation at the corresponding redshift .",
    "although , in some cases , the plausible presence of an agn could affect the derived metallicities , this is probably not the main cause of the discrepancies with the mass - metallicity relation . instead , gas mixing due to inflows and outflows during the ir phase could temporarily move sources out of the mass - metallicity trend ( see e.g. rupke et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the comparison of optical emission - line derived and fiducial ( ir+uv ) sfr indicates that ir galaxies are generally quite affected by extinction .",
    "sfr derived from the extincted @xmath4and @xmath5lines underestimate the real sfr , on average , by factors @xmath206 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "we note , however , that these discrepancies are expected to be maximal for the most luminous ir galaxies . in other galaxies",
    ", the @xmath4or @xmath5luminosities should constitute more reliable sfr estimators .    also from our spectroscopic analysis",
    ", we found that it is difficult to explain the properties of many ir galaxies at @xmath52 with a constant sfh .",
    "instead , a sfh characterised by secondary bursts of star formation can simultaneously explain the blue continuum and relatively small @xmath207 ew observed in most of these sources ( see also hammer et al .",
    "these results also constrain the epoch of ir activity : the lirg and ulirg phases for star - forming galaxies occurs , on average , between @xmath16 and @xmath17 years after the onset of the secondary burst .",
    "most of the hosts of intense ir activity at @xmath18 have older underlying stellar populations and have assembled most of their stellar mass in the past ( caputi et al",
    ".  2006a ) .",
    "the very short times for the onset of the ir phase after the burst also suggest that the dust being heated during these rejuvenating episodes of star formation must be ` old dust ' , i.e. dust produced by agb stars from previous stellar generations .",
    "all these conclusions are valid in general for all the galaxies we have analysed here , independently of their ir luminosity and redshift , suggesting that the way in which star formation proceeds is basically the same in most of these systems ( i.e. independently of the mechanism triggering the burst ) .",
    "finally , @xmath3910% of our galaxies are recognised as blagn from their zcosmos spectra .",
    "another @xmath208 are x - ray - luminous agn with narrow - line spectra",
    ". these figures are consistent with the fraction of agn - dominated ir sources found in the literature ( e.g. alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2006 ; caputi et al.2006a , b,2007 ) . however , agn activity might also be present in some other galaxies , as suggested by their high ionisation levels or _",
    "irac_-power law seds .",
    "the exact fraction of agn and agn / star - forming composite systems among ir galaxies is still far from being clear . in the future , very deep x - ray data and far - ir data obtained with the _ herschel",
    "_ telescope will be available for the cosmos field .",
    "both datasets analysed in conjunction should help to put stronger constraints on the agn contribution to the ir background .",
    "the results obtained in this paper offer some important clues of the role of the ir phase in star - formation history and galaxy evolution , mainly at @xmath52 .",
    "ir sources are the signposts of the most intense star formation activity and on - going build - up of stellar mass .",
    "but the ir phase is a kind of a transitory state in which some galaxy properties ( e.g. the strength of the @xmath209 break and , in some cases , the metallicity ) are perturbed from their regular values in the ir - inactive galaxy life .",
    "this should be kept in mind when considering ir sources for a census of galaxy properties , as the values measured for some of these properties could be well apart from those that will hold at long term once the ir phase has faded out .",
    "this paper is based on observations made with the vimos spectrograph on the melipal - vlt telescope , undertaken at the european southern observatory ( eso ) under large program 175.a-0839 . also based on observations made with the _ spitzer _ observatory , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under nasa contract 1407 .",
