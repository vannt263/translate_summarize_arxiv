    "before the contributions of a paper are brought to the notice of the research community , it has to usually pass through a peer - review process , whereby , the correctness and the novelty of the paper is judged by a set of knowledgeable peers .",
    "the primary intent of which is to prevent flawed research from getting into mainstream literature @xcite .    * debates on peer - review system : * the effectiveness of this system has been put to question in numerous cases ( @xcite ) with flawed research being added to literature while significantly novel contributions being rejected . that the reviewers often fail to reach consensus ( @xcite ) and that rejected papers are often cited more in the long run ( @xcite ) ,",
    "have already been pointed out .",
    "although there have been several proposals to make it more effective ( @xcite ) , the research community is coming to a conclusion that although peer - review system is indispensable it is nonetheless flawed @xcite .    * entities in the peer - review system : * the effectiveness of the peer - review system is dependent directly on the knowledge and training of the editors and reviewers .",
    "the editor is responsible for identifying the correct set of referees who can give expert comments on the submission and also for taking the final decision whether a particular paper should be accepted or rejected .",
    "the assisting reviewers send their views on the paper in the form of a report .",
    "this report is an important part of the whole process as it not only forms the basis of the acceptance / rejection decision but is also sent to the authors for further improvement of the paper .",
    "* anomalous behavior : * ideally impactful papers should be accepted for publication while flawed works should be rejected .",
    "we quantify the impact of a paper by the citations it garnered .",
    "thus , a paper getting accepted but managing to garner very less or no citation should be attributed to the anomaly of the system ; similarly , a paper getting rejected by the peer - review - system but garnering large number of citations in the long run is also an anomaly .",
    "we in this paper investigate the reasons behind the anomalous behaviors ( @xcite ) of the reviewers and editors as they are the most important entities of the peer - review system .",
    "note that although the number of such anomalous editors or referees might be small compared to the number of normal editors or reviewers ( as is usually the case with any anomalous set ) , the damage they can cause to the peer - review system could be irreparable and therefore a thorough investigation of this set is extremely necessary .",
    "* characterizing anomalous editors and reviewers : * a thorough investigation of the behavior of the * editors * shows that those editors who ( i ) are assigned papers more frequently , ( ii ) select reviewers from a very small set , ( iii ) assign themselves as reviewers more often ( rather than assigning other reviewers ) are often under - performers and hence anomalous .",
    "similarly , for * reviewers * we observe the following behaviors to be anomalous - ( i ) frequent assignments , ( ii ) very small or very large delay in sending reports , ( iii ) reviewing papers in very specific topics , ( iv ) assignments from a very small set of editors or in some cases a single editor , ( v ) very high or very low proportion of acceptance , ( vi ) large delay in informing the editor about inability to review and ( vii ) often declining to review .",
    "papers accepted by reviewers with such behaviors are often low cited while those rejected by them are often highly cited .    *",
    "identifying anomalous editors and reviewers : * all the above observations lead us to believe that anomalous editors and reviewers can be differentiated from the genuine contributors . to this aim",
    "we use these observations as features and by leveraging anomaly detection techniques we are indeed able to filter out the anomalous editors and reviewers . in specific",
    "we use @xmath7-means clustering @xcite to classify normal and anomalous editors and reviewers .",
    "we find @xmath5 of the editors and @xmath6 of the reviewers to be anomalous .",
    "we further observe that the papers accepted by these anomalous reviewers are on average cited less while those rejected by them are cited more .",
    "* organization of the paper : * the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ dataset ]",
    "we describe in detail the dataset we used for our analysis and point out certain important features . in section  [ anomalies ]",
    "we identify several factors which help in characterizing anomalous editors and referees . in section  [ prediction ]",
    "we identify anomalous editors and reviewers .",
    "we further assess the performance of the anomalous reviewers in section  [ profile ] .",
    "we finally conclude in section  [ conclusion ] by highlighting our main contributions and pointing to certain future directions .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the main aim of this work is to understand the anomalous behaviors of the peer - review system . for this purpose",
    ", we use the dataset provided to us by the journal of high energy physics ( jhep ) .",
    "jhep is one of the leading journals with an impact factor of @xmath8 ( 2014 ) and publishes theoretical , experimental and phenomenological papers .",
    "the dataset consists of * 28871 * papers that were submitted between 1997 ( year of inception ) and 2015 of which * 20384 * were accepted and * 7073 * were rejected .",
    "the rest of the papers were either withdrawn by the authors or the final decisions were not available .",
    "the meta information available for each paper are ( i ) title , ( ii ) name of the contributing authors , ( iii ) abstract , ( iv ) date of publication and ( v ) number of citations till 2015 .",
    "more importantly , we have for each paper full action history from the date of submission to the date of publication including the editor(s ) and the reviewer(s ) involved for the review of the paper , the report provided by the reviewer and the report sent to the authors by the editor .",
    "we further queried the _",
    "inspire _ database to obtain the meta information of the papers ( not published / rejected in jhep ) . using this information we created a citation profile for each paper i.e. , citations received by the paper per year from the year of its publication .",
    "garfield et .",
    "@xcite had noted that most papers receive the bulk of their citations within the first three years of publication .",
    "moreover it is known that old papers generally have more citations , as the paper had more time to accumulate the citations .",
    "thus to account for this effect , we calculated total citations received by each paper in the first three years from its year of publication ( e.g. , for a paper published in 2007 we consider the citations received by it till 2010 ) .",
    "for the rest of this article , by citation of a paper we refer to the number of citations it received in the first three years from the year of its publication and we only consider the papers published between 1997 to 2012 for our experiments .",
    "some general properties of the whole dataset are summarized below - + ( i ) number of unique editors in the dataset is 95 while the number of reviewers is 4035 .",
    "( ii ) there are @xmath9 unique authors in the dataset and of those @xmath10 have at least one accepted paper .",
    "( iii ) average number of submissions per author is @xmath11 while the average number of authors per paper is 2.87 .",
    "( iv ) average number of reviews for accepted and rejected are @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "( v ) average number of assignments per editor is @xmath14 while per reviewer it is @xmath15 .",
    "in the peer - review process each submission is assigned to an editor who in turn assigns one or more reviewers with the task of judging the quality of the contributions of the submitted paper .",
    "the reviewer submits a report to the editor who in turn takes the final decision as to accept or reject the paper based on the report .",
    "therefore , the editors and the reviewers are the two important entities of the peer - review system and they are mainly responsible for ensuring that flawed research does not get into the literature while at the same time correctly identify impactful contributions for publication .",
    "so in our setting we define the following two cases to be anomalous - + ( i ) accepted papers having low citation ( research wrongly judged as impactful ) .",
    "+ ( ii ) rejected papers having high citation ( quality research wrongly judged as flawed ) .",
