    "pump - probe experiments are the preferred technique to study the dynamical behaviour of atoms and molecules : the dynamics triggered by the pump pulse can be monitored by the time - dependent reaction of the system to the probe pulse , a reaction that can be measured in terms of , for example , the absorption of the pulse intensity , or of the emission of electrons .",
    "@xcite the time resolution of these experiments is mainly limited by the duration of the pulses  although it is also limited by the ability of the experimenter to ascertain their relative time delay and shape . in order to precisely fix this delay , the two pulses are coherently synchronized  in fact",
    ", they have the same origin , or one of them is used to generate the other  , so that the delay is gauged by an optical path difference.@xcite the electron dynamics has a natural time - scale in the range of attoseconds , and therefore could not be studied by pump - probe spectroscopy until the advent of attosecond - pulse laser sources one decade ago.@xcite nowadays time - resolved spectroscopy can be utilized to monitor electron dynamics in real time , giving birth to the field of attosecond physics .",
    "@xcite    a wealth of possibilities exists , depending on the frequencies , durations and intensities of the two pulses .",
    "a common set - up in attosecond physics employs a xuv attosecond pulse and the relatively more intense nir or visible longer ( few femtoseconds ) pulse used for its generation .",
    "combining two xuv attosecond pulses is in principle possible ( and has been theoretically analysed@xcite ) , but unfortunately the low outputs of current xuv attosecond pulses lead to much too weak signals .",
    "another choice to make is the final observable , i.e. what kind of system reaction is to be measured as a function of the time delay . in this work we focus on two common choices .",
    "one , observing the emission of electrons ( their energies , angular distribution , or total yield ) from the pumped system due to the probe pulse .",
    "this can be called time - resolved photo - electron spectroscopy ( trpes ) .",
    "two , observing the optical absorption of the probe signal , which can be called time resolved absorption spectroscopy , or transient absorption spectroscopy ( tas ) .",
    "both techniques can of course be used to look at longer time resolutions  and there is already a substantial body of literature describing such experiments . if we look at molecular reaction on the scale of tens or hundreds of femtoseconds , the atomic structure will have time to re - arrange .",
    "these techniques are thus mainly employed to observe modification , creation , or destruction of bonds , a field now named _",
    "femtochemistry_.@xcite    tas , for example , has been succesfully employed to _ watch _ the first photo - synthetic events in cholorophylls and carotenoids,@xcite that transform the energy gained by light absorption into molecular rearrangements .",
    "a review describing the essentials of this technique can be found in ref .  .",
    "note , however , that in addition to following chemical reactions , femtosecond - long pulses may also be used for example for characterizing the final electronic quantum state of ionized atoms.@xcite    in trpes , the probe pulse generates free electrons through photo - ionization , and one measures their energy or angular distribution as a function of time ; if this time is in the femtosecond scale one can follow molecular dynamics in the gas phase , as demonstrated already in the mid 1990s,@xcite although this technique had already been employed to follow electronic dynamics on surfaces.@xcite this methodology is well documented in recent articles.@xcite    if the goal as in this work is to study the electronic dynamics _ only _ , disentangling them from the vibronic degrees of freedom , then one must move down these spectroscopic methods to the attosecond regime.@xcite in this regime , both tas and trpes have recently been demonstrated .",
    "regarding tas , we may cite as a prototypical example the recent experiment of holler _ _",
    "et al__@xcite where , the transient absorption of an attosecond pulse train ( created by high harmonic generation ) by a helium gas target , was studied in the presence of an intense ir pulse .",
    "the absorption was observed to oscillate as a function of the time - delay of pump and probe .",
    "another example is the real - time observation of valence electron motion reported by goulielmakis _",
    "et al_.@xcite    several cases of use of trpes with attosecond pulses have also been recently reported .",
    "for example , uiberacker _",
    "et al._@xcite could observe in real time the light induced electron tunneling provoked by a strong nir pulse , demonstrating how this electron tunneling can be used to probe short lived electronic states .",
    "et al_@xcite also studied the ionization of an atom by an attosecond xuv pulse in the presence of an intense laser pulse , as a function of the time delay between both .",
    "et al_@xcite employed attosecond pulse trains and a helium target , and attosecond photoelectron spectroscopy was also demonstrated to yield useful information for condensed matter systems.@xcite",
    "all these advances demand an appropriate theoretical modeling .",
    "the use of more than one pulse of light intrinsically requires to go beyond any `` linear spectroscopy '' technique ",
    "although if the pulses are weak a perturbative treatment may still be in order .",
    "this non - linear behavior , provides much more information about the system at the cost of a increasingly difficult analysis .",
    "the use of two ( or more ) coherent pulses of light , with fine control over their shape ( sometimes called a `` multidimensional analysis '' ) , permits a deeper characterization .",
    "this fact was already acknowledged in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance , or later in femtochemistry ",
    "see for example refs .   and for theoretical treatments of these cases .",
    "a recent theoretical analysis of attosecond tas based on perturbation theory was given by baggesen _",
    "et al_.  @xcite gaarde _",
    "@xcite presented a study for relatively weak pumping ir pulses in combination with xuv ultrafast probes , for helium targets and based on the single active electron approximation ( sae ) .",
    "very recently , the experimented reported by ott _",
    "et al._@xcite , in which the ultrafast tas of helium displayed characteristic beyond - sae features , was theoretically analyzed in ref .",
    ", utilizing an exact solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , that can not however be easily extended to larger systems . finally , the above - mentioned experiment of goulielmalkis _",
    "et al_@xcite was analized with the model described in ref .  , which treated the pump ir pulse non - perturbatively .    indeed",
    ", it would be desirable to analyze these processes with a non - perturbative theory ( since at least one of the pulses is usually very intense ) , which at the same time is capable of going beyond the sae and accounting for many - electron interaction effects .",
    "this last fact is relevant since the attosecond time resolution obtained in this type of experiments is able to unveil the fast dynamical electron - electron interaction effects .",
    "the sae , which essentially assumes that only one electron actively responds to the laser pulse , has been successfully used to interpret many strong - field processes . however , its range of validity is limited , and roughly speaking it is expected to fail whenever the energies of multielectron excitations become comparable to the laser frequencies or the single electron excitations.@xcite    time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft )  @xcite in principle meets all requirements : it may be used non - perturbatively , includes the electron - electron interaction and can handle out - of - equilibrium situations .",
    "it has been routinely used in the past decades to study the electron dynamics in condensed matter _ in equilibrium_. by this we mean that , usually , one computes the linear or non - linear response properties of systems in the ground state ( or at thermal equlibrium ) . in pump - probe experiments , however , one must compute the response of a system that is being driven out of equilibrium by an initial pulse . in this work , we will explore the usability of tddft for this purpose , and show how , at least for the two cases of tas and trpes , the extension is straightforward .",
    "density - functional theory  @xcite establishes a one - to - one correspondence between the ground - state density and the external potential of a many - electron system .",
    "this implies that any system property is , in principle , a ground - state density functional .",
    "the computation of the ground - state density usually follows the kohn - sham ( ks)@xcite scheme , in which one utilizes a fictitious system of non - interacting electrons that has the same ground state density . for excited states , properties , however , or in order to simulate the behavior of the system in time - dependent external fields",
    ", one must use its time - dependent version , tddft.@xcite    in the case of tddft , a one - to - one correspondence also exists between the time - dependent densities and potentials .",
    "one also uses an auxiliary fictitious system of non - interacting electrons that produces the same time - dependent density .",
    "this substitution is the source of the great computational simplification , since a non - interacting system of electrons can in general be represented by a single slater determinant formed by a set of `` kohn - sham '' orbitals , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we will assume a spin - compensated system of @xmath2 electrons doubly occupying @xmath3 spatial orbitals .",
    "if the real system is irradiated with an external field characterized by a scalar potential @xmath4 ( the extension to vector potentials is also possible ) , the `` time - dependent kohn - sham '' ( tdks ) equations that characterize the evolution of the fictitious system are ( atomic units will be used hereafter ) : @xmath5(\\vec{r},t)\\varphi_i(\\vec{r},t)\\ , ,",

    "the exchange correlation potential is also a functional of the density and accounts for all the intricate many - electron effects .",
    "it is in practice unknown and must be approximated.@xcite    the tdks equations can be utilized , either directly or in appropriately transformed manner , to compute the response of a many - electron system to a perturbation , weak or strong . in the perturbative regime , ideally one wishes to obtain the response functions [ ( hyper)-polarizabilities , optical and magnetic susceptibilities ,  ] , since ( i ) these objects then permit to predict any reaction in the appropriate order , and ( ii ) experiments typically provide spectra that are directly related to the response functions ",
    "e.g. the optical absorption cross section of a gas is proportional to the imaginary part of the dipole - dipole molecular polarizability . in contrast , in the strong - field regime , where perturbative treatments become cumbersome , one normally computes the particular response of the system to the perturbation of interest by directly propagating the tdks equations in real time .",
    "the vast majority of tddft applications have addressed the first - order response of the ground - state system to weak electric fields  which can provide the absorption spectrum , the optically - allowed excitation energies and oscillator strengths , etc .",
    "this can be performed by linearizing the tdks equations in the frequency domain and casting the result into matrix - eigenvalue form , or by propagating the same equations in real time applying a sufficiently weak dipole perturbation . in any case",
    ", the response function computed in this manner will be that of the ground state .",
    "if we want to analyze a tas experiment , the objective is to obtain the response of the excited states that are visited by the system as it is driven by the pump pulse ( i.e. the response function of a system out of equilibrium ) .",
    "this extension will be treated in section  [ subsection : tas ] .",
    "likewise , tddft can be used to compute strong field non - linear photo - electron spectra of atoms and molecules , for example with the method recently developed by some of us.@xcite these spectra , however , are also characteristic of the ground state , although , as it will be shown in section  [ subsection : pes ] , the methodology can be easily extended to tackle the pump - probe case ( time - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy  @xcite ) .",
    "when an electromagnetic pulse passes through a gas sample , the molecules polarize , and this polarization modifies the otherwise free propagation of light ",
    "one of the consequences being the partial absorption of it . in a dilute gas , assuming the electric dipole approximation and a sufficiently weak pulse , the dipole - dipole linear dynamical polarizability entirely determines the polarization of the medium , and therefore the amount of absorption .",
    "this is usually understood _ at equilibrium _ : the gas is formed by molecules at thermal equilibrium ( perhaps at sufficiently low temperature so that they all can be considered to be at their ground state ) , and the only light pulse present is that whose absorption we want to measure .    in the pump - probe situation discussed here , however , one wishes to compute the absorption of a probe pulse by a set of molecules that is also irradiated by a pump , either simultaneously or with a given delay .",
    "the task is therefore to compute the response of the electric dipole with and without the probe pulse  the difference being the excess of polarization , responsible for the absorption of the probe .",
    "we will assume , as it is often the case , that the pump pulse is intense , whereas the probe is weak and can be treated in first order perturbation theory .",
    "this situation is amenable to a generalized definition of response functions , such as the one given in the appendix of ref .   and",
    "also discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "we will review here this definition , adapting it to the pump - probe situation .",
    "let us depart from a hamiltonian in the form ( we only treat the electric part neglecting the magnetic term of the electromagnetic field ) : @xmath13(t ) = \\hat{\\mathcal{h } } + \\mathcal{e}(t ) \\hat{v }    \\label{eq : hamiltonian - time - dependent}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the static hamiltonian that defines the system itself , and @xmath15 is the coupling to the `` pump '' laser pulse .",

    "<S> we show how the extra degrees of freedom ( pump pulse duration , intensity , frequency , and time - delay ) , which are absent in a conventional steady state experiment , provide additional information about electronic structure and dynamics that improve a system characterization . as an extension of this approach </S>",
    "<S> , time - dependent 2d spectroscopies can also be simulated , in principle , for large - scale structures and extended systems . </S>"
