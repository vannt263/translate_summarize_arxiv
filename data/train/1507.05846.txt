    "+ - in space - based surveys similar to cosmos , even at the highest magnitude cuts ( f814@xmath524.0 ) , the contamination levels are significantly lower than those at the brightest magnitudes in the ground - based surveys .",
    "the observational bias is insignificant for all parameters at magnitudes brighter than f814=21.0 ( except for the lt_lt galaxies ) .",
    "however , when going to fainter magnitudes the contamination increases , and depending on the diagram it changes from 2 - 25% at f814@xmath523.0 , to 6 - 35% for et , and 20 - 70% for lt galaxies at f814@xmath524.0 . in surveys similar to cosmos",

    "<S> we consistently analyse for the first time the impact of survey depth and spatial resolution on the most used morphological parameters for classifying galaxies through non - parametric methods : abraham and conselice - bershady concentration indices , gini , m20 moment of light , asymmetry , and smoothness . </S>",
    "<S> three different non - local datasets are used , alhambra and sxds ( examples of deep ground - based surveys ) , and cosmos ( deep space - based survey ) . </S>",
    "<S> we used a sample of 3000 local , visually classified galaxies , measuring their morphological parameters at their real redshifts ( z@xmath00 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we simulated them to match the redshift and magnitude distributions of galaxies in the non - local surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the comparisons of the two sets allow to put constraints on the use of each parameter for morphological classification and evaluate the effectiveness of the commonly used morphological diagnostic diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> all analysed parameters suffer from biases related to spatial resolution and depth , the impact of the former being much stronger . when including asymmetry and smoothness in classification diagrams , the noise effects must be taken into account carefully , especially for ground - based surveys . </S>",
    "<S> m20 is significantly affected , changing both the shape and range of its distribution at all brightness levels . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that diagnostic diagrams based on 2 - 3 parameters should be avoided when classifying galaxies in ground - based surveys , independently of their brightness ; for cosmos they should be avoided for galaxies fainter than f814=23.0 . </S>",
