    "since @xmath3 meson was observed by cdf in 1998 @xcite , the interests in studying of the meson @xmath3 are increasing and a new stage of the studies has been started . as pointed by the authors of refs.@xcite ,",
    "the product cross - section at large hadron collider ( lhc ) , cern , is much greater than that at tevatron , fermilab , therefore , more precise experimental studies of @xmath3 meson are expected at the forthcoming of lhc .",
    "indeed , some progress at lhc in the experimental study of @xmath3 physics can be achieved , especially at the beginning stage of lhc ( lhc just runs at low luminosity @xmath23 ) .",
    "however , when lhc runs at higher luminosity , such as the design luminosity @xmath24 later on , due to the requests coming from the main purposes of lhc ( such as searching for higgs particle and susy partners etc ) and the restricts from the abilities to record the events for the detector ( e.g. the detector can not record too frequently events etc ) , the condition for triggering the events occurring in collisions has to be set such that too many @xmath3 events via the direct hadronic production according to the theoretical estimate of ` direct ' @xmath3-production@xcite are cut off . as a result",
    ", the direct hadronic production of @xmath3 can not be expected to make much progress in @xmath3-meson study in the high luminosity stage of lhc runs .",
    "baring the situation pointed out here and the possible upgrade for lhc ( slhc , dlhc and tlhc etc@xcite ) in mind , the possibility to study @xmath3 meson experimentally via indirect production of @xmath3 meson , namely , via producing a huge amount of top antiquarks @xmath5 and their decays , is worthwhile to think seriously about .",
    "it is because that at lhc no matter how high the luminosity , the produced top quark(s ) shall never be cut off by the trigger condition set down for any experimental purposes , and the frequency of the @xmath4-quark production can be stood up for the detector always .",
    "furthermore , the mechanisms for producing the doubly heavy mesons , such as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath3 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath27 , are interesting too .",
    "the indirect production of @xmath3 or @xmath1(or @xmath31 ) , including its excited states , via @xmath5-decays or @xmath4-decays may offer some knowledge on the mechanisms , therefore , this paper is devoted to study the indirect production of @xmath3 or @xmath1 meson via @xmath5-decays or @xmath4-decays . without confusing and for simplifying the statements , later on we will not distinguish @xmath3 and @xmath1 unless necessary , and all results for @xmath3 and @xmath1 obtained in the paper are symmetric in the interchange from particle to anti - particle .    the doubly heavy meson production via top quark decays is special interesting from the point view of precise testing perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd)@xcite .",
    "the meson @xmath1 is the ground state of the heavy - flavored binding system @xmath0 , and it is unique ` doubly heavy - flavored ' anti - meson in standard model and is stable for strong and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "although in literature the ` direct ' hadornic production of @xmath1 meson has been thoroughly studied , e.g. see refs .",
    "@xcite ( references therein ) and cdf discovered the meson which just come from the ` direct ' production , as a compensation to understand the production mechanisms , it is quite interesting that to study the production of @xmath1 meson ` indirectly ' through @xmath4-quark decays , especially , considering the fact that numerous @xmath4-quarks may be produced at lhc .",
    "the theoretical studies of the direct production@xcite is based on nrqcd @xcite , so now we study the indirect production based on nrqcd too .    in the framework of effective theory of nrqcd ,",
    "a doubly heavy meson is considered as an expansion of a series fock states .",
    "the relative importance among the infinite ingredients is accounted by the velocity scaling rule .",
    "namely the physical state of @xmath1 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be decomposed into a series of fock states as follows : @xmath35 and @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the relative velocity between the components .",
    "the thickened subscripts of the @xmath0 denote for color indices , @xmath38 for color singlet and @xmath39 for color - octet ; the relevant angular momentum quantum numbers are shown in the parentheses accordingly . according to the velocity scaling rule of nrqcd , the probability of each fock state in the expansion is proportional to a definite power in @xmath37 as indicated as that in eqs.([eq:1],[eq:2 ] ) .",
    "since the value of @xmath40 is around @xmath41 @xcite , which is not too small , and the contributions from the two color - octet s - wave components to the @xmath13-wave production might be comparable with those from the color - singlet components .",
    "so we shall consider the two color - octet components : @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in addition to those color - singlet components in the mesons @xmath1 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the calculations of the process are very complicated and lengthy by using the conventional trace techniques to calculate the amplitude square due to the two massive particles and bound state effects .",
    "to shorten the calculations and to make the results more compact , we adopt the method used in ref.@xcite to do the calculations .",
    "for convenience , we will call it as the ` new trace amplitude approach ' . under this approach ,",
    "we first arrange the whole amplitude into several orthogonal sub - amplitudes @xmath44 according to the spins of the @xmath4-quark ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46-quark ( @xmath47 ) , and then do the trace of the dirac @xmath48 matrix strings at the amplitude level , which result in explicit series over some independent lorentz - structures , and finally , we obtain the square of the amplitude . during the calculating ,",
    "some useful tricks have also been introduced to make the expressions more compact .",
    "more detail of the techniques and all the necessary expressions for the amplitudes of @xmath49 with @xmath0-quarkonium in @xmath9 , @xmath50 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 ( with @xmath18 ) respectively are put in the appendix b. while the expressions for the contributions from the two color - octet components @xmath19 and @xmath51 can be obtained from those from the two color singlet @xmath8-wave components by changing the overall color - factor and the corresponding matrix elements .",
    "this approach is different from that of the spinor techniques or the so called ` helicity amplitude approach ' , which has been proposed in ref.@xcite and improved in ref.@xcite . under the ` helicity",
    "amplitude approach ' , one can also derive compact results that can be further expressed by spinor - products at the amplitude level and then do the numerical calculations .",
    "the above two methods are complement to each other and both can derive simple and compact expressions at the amplitude level .",
    "the ` helicity amplitude approach ' is more suitable for the numerical calculations and is more quicker for calculations , since full components of the helicity amplitude can be evaluated at the amplitude level . while for the ` new trace amplitude approach ' , at the amplitude level only the coefficients of the basic lorentz structures are numerical .",
    "however from the amplitude derived from the new trace amplitude approach , one can sequentially result in the squared amplitude , which is more easier to be compared with the results derived by the traditional trace techniques .    according to refs.@xcite",
    ", one may expect at lhc to produce @xmath52 @xmath53-pairs per year under the luminosity @xmath24 .",
    "considering the possible upgrade for lhc and the estimate by refs.@xcite , we will assume that one may obtain @xmath54 @xmath53-pairs per year to examine the possibility to observe the meson @xmath3 via decay of the produced @xmath53-pairs precisely and to examine the advantages in the indirect way to observe the meson @xmath3 and its excited states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we show our calculation techniques for the process @xmath55",
    ". then we present numerical results and make some discussions on the properties of the @xmath0-production through @xmath4-quark decays in sec.iii .",
    "the fourth section is reserved for a summary .",
    "all necessary expressions are put in the appendices finally .",
    "under the nrqcd framework @xcite , the total decay width for the production of @xmath0-quarkonium through the channel @xmath56 takes the form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 refers to the number of colors , @xmath59 stands for the involved state of @xmath60-quarkonium .",

    "moreover , the indirect production of the @xmath0-quarkonium may be traced back to @xmath4-quark decay and has the characteristics in @xmath180 shown in figs.(2,3 ) etc , that may be used to identify the @xmath0-quarkonium events .",
    "thus there may be some advantages in @xmath0-quarkonium studies via the indirect production in comparison with the direct production .",
    "especially when lhc is really upgraded to slhc , dlhc and tlhc , so @xmath181 @xmath53 per year may be produced , one may expect much progress in @xmath0-quarkonium studies is achieved then .",

    "in this section , we derive the phase space of @xmath182 .",
    "the decay width is proportional to the phase space : @xmath183 where @xmath184 . furthermore ,",
    "in the rest frame of top quark ( @xmath185 ) , we have @xmath186 where @xmath187 and @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "the step function @xmath191 is determined by ensuring @xmath192 , where @xmath193 all these step functions leads to the integration ranges : @xmath194}{2s_2 } \\\\ s_1^{\\rm max } & = & m^2_{1}+m_2 ^ 2-\\frac{\\left [ ( s_2-m_t^2+m^2_{1 } ) ( s_2-m_3 ^ 2+m^2_2)- \\sqrt{\\lambda(s_2,m_t^2,m^2_{1 } ) \\lambda(s_2,m_w^2,m^2_2 ) } \\right]}{2s_2 } \\\\ s_2^{\\rm min } & = & ( m_2+m_3)^2 \\\\ s_2^{\\rm max } & = & ( m_t - m_{1})^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath195 .",

    "the distribution for @xmath171 can be obtained in a similar way .",
    "now let us illustrate the method to calculate the amplitude squared .",
    "in general , the amplitude for the process in which two massive fermions with spin projection @xmath47 and @xmath45 are involved can be written as @xmath203 where @xmath204 and @xmath205 denote the momenta of the top quark and the charm quark with mass @xmath206 and @xmath207 , and @xmath69 is an explicit string of dirac @xmath48 matrices for the process , which can be read from eqs.([swave1],[swave2],[swave3],[swave4],[pwave1 ] , [ pwave2],[pwave3],[pwave4 ] ) .",
    "let us introduce a massless spinor @xmath208 with a light - like momentum @xmath209 and negative helicity first .",
    "thus @xmath208 is satisfied with the following projection relation : @xmath210 where @xmath211 . by introducing another spacelike vector @xmath212 which satisfies the relations : @xmath213 then the other , massless , independent and positive helicity spinor @xmath214",
    "may be constructed : @xmath215 it is easy to check that @xmath214 is satisfied with the projection @xmath216 where @xmath217 . using these massless spinors",
    ", one can construct the massive spinors for the fermion and antifermion as follows : @xmath218 with the spin vector @xmath219 : @xmath220 using the above identities , we can write down the amplitude @xmath221 with four possible spin projections in the trace form for the @xmath48-matrices : @xmath222 \\\\ m_{-s - s ' } & = & n tr[({\\not{\\!p_0}}+m_t)\\cdot \\omega_{+}{\\not{\\!k_0}}\\cdot({\\not{\\!p_2}}+m_c)\\cdot a ] \\\\ m_{-ss ' } & = & n tr[({\\not{\\!p_0}}+m_t)\\cdot \\omega_{-}{\\not{\\!k_0}}{\\not{\\!k_1}}\\cdot({\\not{\\!p_2}}+m_c)\\cdot a]\\\\ m_{s - s ' } & = & n tr[({\\not{\\!p_0}}+m_t)\\cdot\\omega_{+}{\\not{\\!k_1 } } { \\not{\\!k_0}}\\cdot({\\not{\\!p_2}}+m_c)\\cdot a]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the normalization constant @xmath223 .",
    "thus the squared unpolarized matrix elements can be written as @xmath224    next , we are to simplify the calculation . for such purpose , we recombine these @xmath225 into @xmath226 ( @xmath227 ) as follows : @xmath228 \\\\",
