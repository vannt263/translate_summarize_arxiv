    "because of the many applications of laser beam deflection measurement of a microcantilever a number of studies have explored how the laser spot may change the mechanical properties of the cantilever@xcite and affect the accuracy of its vibrational frequency measurement.@xcite it is known that joule heating , via both a temperature dependent young s modulus and thermal expansion , shifts the vibrational frequency to the red for silicon and silicon nitride.@xcite at low laser power the expected blue shift from radiation - induced pressure change in the vibrational frequency is usually too small to be important.@xcite recently we have observed a visible laser - induced blue frequency shift for the vibrational frequency of sin cantilevers , which may be the result of a surface stress generated by photo - excited carriers .",
    "this last experimental observation has opened up the opportunity to quantify a nonlinear dynamical effect that was reported some years back.@xcite    the earlier discovery that localized dynamical energy can be stabilized in a perfect nonlinear lattice by its discreteness had demonstrated that both extended and localized waves were necessary features of such systems .",
    "@xcite one end result was that dynamically driven intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) provided a new window into the nonlinear dynamics structure of discrete systems .",
    "@xcite our qualitative observation for a micromechanical array was that when heat from a focused ir laser was applied to a cantilever near a driven ilm on a 1-d lattice the ilm would move to the next lattice site , away from the laser spot , if the lattice had hard nonlinearity ( with increasing amplitude the frequency increases ) ; while , if the lattice had soft nonlinearity ( the converse ) the ilm would hop toward the ir laser spot .",
    "@xcite with sufficient laser power the ilm would track the moving laser spot .",
    "@xcite the recent discovery of the visible laser - induced blue shift of the cantilever resonance in sin now makes possible a detailed investigation of the dynamics behind the ir laser - induced pushing or visible laser pulling of the ilm in the same lattice .",
    "experimentally , a stationary ilm can be maintained in steady state using a driver to compensate for damping.@xcite in this case the ilm is frequency locked , and an auto - resonance ( ar ) state @xcite is achieved where the driver frequency controls the ilm amplitude . previously , it has been demonstrated that a linear response measurement in the driven 1-d array is a powerful tool for studying bifurcation dynamics of an ilm.@xcite    here this same technique is used to follow both the release and capture of an ilm by laser generated impurities . with application of the ir laser the soft impurity produces a nonlinear coupling between the natural frequency ( nf ) of the ilm and a nearby even linear local mode ( llm )  @xcite associated with the ilm , giving rise to parametric amplification of both of these modes .",
    "sufficient amplitude can be generated to induce translational ilm motion .",
    "when the ir laser spot is replaced by a visible one so that a hard impurity is generated the same mixing process again provides the necessary translational amplitude .",
    "the sign of the translation is controlled by the frequency of the impurity mode relative to the plane wave band .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that when it is a soft impurity mode the center of gravity of the ilm moves away from the impurity while the opposite occurs for a hard impurity mode .",
    "the next section illustrates the experimental setup and describes the measurement procedure for the micromechanical array .",
    "section  [ sec : experiment ] first presents the experimental results for the visible laser hardening of a single vibrating cantilever and then shows the linear response measurements for the driven nonlinear di - element lattice using a pump - probe method while either an infrared or visible laser generates a soft or hard impurity , respectively . in section  [ sec : simulation ] simulation results are compared with experiments .",
    "it is verified that the transition from stationary to moving ilm occurs when the natural frequency ( nf ) and the even - llm frequencies are symmetrically located about the driven ilm frequency .",
    "it is also demonstrated with a harmonic impurity - impurity model that the sign of the effect is consistent with the observed impurity - induced repulsion and attraction .",

    "the driver frequency is fixed during this transition measurement process . for the visible laser attraction case , a higher power ( 1 mw ) visible laser",

    "the driven ilm also gives rise to nearby llms .",
    "with a fixed boundary condition , or by symmetry breaking by the ar state , all linear modes can be classified into odd and even symmetries in terms of the vibrating spatial pattern and appear alternatively when ordered by their mode frequency .",

    "normally even modes are not recorded in these spectra but if an impurity exists at one side of the ilm , the symmetry is broken and the even mode becomes observable in our experiment .",
    "since laser radiation is used to produce the impurity we have checked the influence of the radiation on the lowest frequency mode response curve of a single cantilever made from the same sin material as the array as a function of different laser powers . for the ir laser the effect is simply to soften the linear spring constant so that the cantilever frequency decreases .",

    "[ fig:8](c ) and [ fig:9](c ) , where the lateral motion is growing with time .    clearly the even - llm is a key element .",

    "there could be two ways to approach this lateral transition of the ilm:(1 ) continuously soften the lateral vibration frequency so that the final translation is described by a frozen vibration of the lateral motion , or ( 2 ) a diverging amplitude of the lateral motion at a fixed frequency that overcomes the pinning barrier .",

    "the hopping mechanism for the visible attraction of the ilm is the same as for the ir laser repulsion case , e.g. , generation of the translational vibration at the symmetric frequency condition of the two linear modes .",
    "an experimental detail is that because of the very weak hardening of the spring constant , the translation can be seen only by scanning the driver frequency . at the symmetric even - llm and nf condition ,",
    "the transition takes place even if the hardening effect is very small . in our case",
    "the effect is so small that the translational motion happens only by controlling the ilm frequency to tune the even - llm and nf to satisfy the nonlinear mixing condition @xmath36 . in simulations ,",
    "we have succeeded in reproducing the translational oscillation plus the parametric effect with the impurity level @xmath37 , while the experimental value is much smaller : @xmath38 .",
    "this difference is most likely due to our approximate simulation model .",
    "it should be emphasized these hopping transitions appear similar to the lower bifurcation transition of the ar region without the impurity when the pump frequency is used as a control parameter.@xcite in that case nf@xmath7 coalesces and interacts with the top band mode at the transition.@xcite in our present picture this would correspond to the nf and the band mode frequencies being symmetrically placed with respect to the ilm frequency .",

    "the band gap of the silicon nitride is from 1.8 to 5.1ev , depending on stoichiometry .",
    "since the visible laser causes hardening while ir laser causes softening , this difference is most likely due to photo - excitation of electrons and holes in the nitride cantilever .",
    "no doubt if we used a much higher power visible laser there would be sufficient heat generated that the temperature effect would overcome the photo - carrier effect . in this case , the visible laser would repel the ilm . since the photon energy of the ir laser is smaller than the band gap of the sin , the radiation may not be absorbed strongly by the cantilever ; however , the power of the ir laser was much larger than for the visible case .",
    "in addition , the silicon substrate also absorbs the ir radiation because its band gap 1.1 ev is smaller than the photon energy .",
    "since cantilevers and overhangs rest on the silicon substrate , and the ir laser is softly focused , the heat absorbed by the silicon may warm up the local cantilevers .",
    "we have found that visible laser radiation hardens the silicon nitride cantilever , most likely due to photo - excited excess carriers , so that its impurity mode attracts the ilm .",
    "the attractive hopping transition of the ar - ilm by the visible laser and the repulsive transition induced by the ir - laser observed in the 1-d micromechanical cantilever array have been examined experimentally and numerically . at the transition points for both kinds of impurities , the nf and the even - llm",
    "are symmetrically positioned with respect to the ilm frequency so that the transition occurs when @xmath36 .",
    "this signature condition produces parametric excitation of the nf and even - llm , drives the lateral motion of the ilm , and this amplified lateral motion causes the translational hopping transition .",
    "interestingly numerical simulations with a harmonic model containing impurities correctly give the sign of the observed interaction but our nonlinear simulations demonstrate that the magnitude of the effect is enhanced in a nonlinear lattice .",
    "finally , casting these results in a larger framework the laser - induced impurity and its impurity mode simply provide a way to connect the ilm to the external world so that its intrinsic translational dynamics can be explored .",
    "should a different technique be applied to tickle a driven ilm in a general 1-d nonlinear lattice with onsite and intersite coupling , to explore its translational transition , then the intrinsic nf and even - llm excitations described here would still play the same defining dynamical role .",
