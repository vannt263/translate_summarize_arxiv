    "these features have already been observed in the case of interaction of ballistic trajectories with pre - fractal pores @xcite in the knudsen diffusion regime where the collision number distribution was found to be of the lvy type .",

    "thus , @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 , as found numerically .",
    "the collision spectrums obtained in the presence of surface micro - roughness , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) are shown in fig .",

    "the value of @xmath64 is decreasing with increasing @xmath29 as it is also seen in the collision number distribution ( fig .",
    "[ pdist ] ) that the maximum number of collisions is decreasing with @xmath29 .    to show the multifractal nature of the distribution @xmath1 , it is necessary to study the scaling of the @xmath0-moments of the measure over different length scales on the slit .",

    "the fact that a sequence of exponents are obtained irrespective of the generation @xmath18 confirms the multifractal nature of the spectrum .",
    "note that the multifractality obtained for the specular collision spectrum at @xmath50 angle of incidence corresponds to a uniform exploration of the irregular surface ( fig .",

    ", the micro - roughness @xmath29 has a significant effect on @xmath2 with respect to @xmath53 .",

    "this means that the spectrum are still of multifractal nature .    to determine the nature of the multifractality , the dimensions @xmath3 are obtained as usual as a function of the lipschitz - h@xmath101lder exponent @xmath102 through a legendre transformation @xcite @xmath103 of the sequence @xmath2",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fa45 ] , where the data for @xmath48 ( circles ) and @xmath120 ( squares ) collapse onto the same curve .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that @xmath5 is exactly equal to the dimension @xmath10 of the pre - fractal and @xmath121 .",
    "these features are specific of the prefractal geometry and the angle of incidence considered here .    always in the case of specular reflections , but",
    "for other angles of incidence like @xmath122 and @xmath123 , it is found that the @xmath3 versus @xmath102 curves also consist of two parabolas .",
    "however , in both cases , the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 keep on changing with the generation @xmath18 upto @xmath47th generation .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the multiplicative process in these cases is more involved than in the case of @xmath50 incidence .",
    "there should exist for these cases a cascade of different sequential values of @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 so that the asymptotic multifractal measure is still not reached for @xmath127 .",
    "the effect of micro - roughness of the surface on the @xmath3 curve is discussed now . in fig .",
    "[ fadf ] , @xmath3 versus @xmath102 curves are plotted for @xmath66 ( circles ) , @xmath99 ( squares ) , and @xmath100 ( diamonds ) at @xmath17 and @xmath48 .",

    "the triangles represent the results for an hypothetic `` totally '' diffusing surface for which re - emission would be isotropic , @xmath8 ; occuring randomly in any direction between @xmath128 to @xmath129 with respect to the normal , independent of the angle of incidence .",
    "this is equivalent to the @xmath130 limit .",
    "there are two important things to note .",
    "first , the micro - roughness ( or random character of the particle re - emission ) of the surface is unable to destroy either the multifractality or the trinomial nature of the multifractality even at the maximum possible value of @xmath29 , corresponding to the `` totally diffusing surface '' .",
    "second , the values of @xmath4 depends strongly on the degree of surface roughness @xmath29 whereas @xmath5 remains almost constant .",
    "the value of @xmath4 increases as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "this is expected . as @xmath29 increases , the value of @xmath64 decreases , the spectrum becoming more uniform as seen in fig .",
    "[ mux2 ] and the smaller value of @xmath64 corresponds to the larger value of @xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath5 could also be estimated from the knowledge of the minimum measure @xmath131 . for a single realization ,",
    "the total number of collisions is @xmath132 .",
    "thus , @xmath133 ( for a trajectory having a single collision ) and the value of @xmath5 is then given by @xmath134 very close to what is obtained here .",
    "since the value of @xmath131 is almost independent of the surface roughness ( total number of collisions almost independent of @xmath29 ) in this collision process , the value of @xmath5 remains unchanged .    from these results",
    ", it is found that the multifractality as well as the trinomial nature of the multifractality associated with this collision process remains unaltered irrespective of the surface micro - roughness .",
    "this is because , the multifractality of the collision spectrum is the outcome of a multiplicative cascade of the spatial sub - distributions which are independent of the various situations considered here .",
    "the trinomial nature of the multifractal is due to the type of pre - fractal chosen here to model the surface macro - irregularity : a quadratic koch curve , each element being divided into three elements in the next generation .",
    "a different pre - fractal generator , @xmath8 ; a different model of surface macro - irregularity will then lead to a different multifractal behavior .",
    "the information dimension @xcite is the value of @xmath3 when @xmath135 .",
    "the information dimension @xmath6 is found to be @xmath136 for @xmath50 angle of incidence with @xmath60 and at @xmath48 .",
    "this indicates that the measure is supported by a minor fraction of the particle trajectories .",
    "this also illustrates the fact that most of the trajectories interacts weakly with the fractal surface .",
    "interestingly , the information dimension increases with the random character of the particle - surface interaction . indeed for @xmath66 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 the values of information dimensions are @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively . for the diffused surface @xmath140 .",
    "this corresponds to more and more uniform collision number distribution on the slit .",
    "it is interesting to comment on the uniform exploration of the surface , each element receiving the same number of particles at least for an angle of incidence of 45 degrees .",
    "this is analogous to the results obtained by andrade et al @xcite through a molecular dynamics study of knudsen diffusion in the same geometry . in this last case , it is the first collision that is uniformly distributed over the perfectly absorbing surface whereas here , the surface is perfectly reflecting .",
    "the uniform exploration found in these both cases constitutes a qualitative evidence of the absence of screening in knudsen diffusion .",
    "it can be considered as a remarkable fact that , seen from the source of particles , the collision numbers are strongly non - uniform , while seen from the surface the exploration is uniform .",
    "this may have interesting consequences for catalyst deactivation which should also be uniformly distributed .",
    "the collision number distribution and their spatial behaviour are obtained for @xmath7 ballistic particles interacting with a pre - fractal curve of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "the trajectories considered here correspond to the knudsen diffusion regime .",
    "the micro - roughness of the surface , or the random character of the particle - surface interaction , is included through a randomness parameter @xmath29 in the reflection angle .",
    "it is found that most of the particles make only a few collisions whereas a few trajectories exhibit a large number of collisions .",
    "a multifractal measure of the spectrum is defined in terms of the relative collision number over a linear slit from which the trajectories are launched .",
    "a sequence of `` collision exponents '' @xmath2 , is determined by the box counting method and it is found that the sequence depends on the moment @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the spatial distribution of the collision numbers is a multifractal spectrum .",
    "the fractal dimensions @xmath3 depend on the random character of the particle re - emission @xmath51 .",
    "irrespective of the values of @xmath29 , the plot of @xmath3 versus lipschitz - h@xmath101lder exponent @xmath102 consist of two parabolas .",
    "the spectrum is then that of a multiplicative trinomial multifractal independent of surface micro - roughness .",
    "the information dimension @xmath6 of the measure is found to be smaller than @xmath32 and increases with the random character of the particle surface interaction .",
    "different type of surface macro - irregularity would lead to different multifractal behavior .",
