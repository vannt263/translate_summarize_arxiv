    "ultra - relativistic collisions between heavy ions are used to study the properties of nuclear matter at high energy density . in particular ,",
    "lattice qcd calculations predict a transition from confined hadronic matter to a state of deconfined quarks and gluons at a critical energy density around 1 gev/@xmath2  @xcite . for recent reviews of experimental results and theoretical developements see references  @xcite .",
    "the momentum distributions of the particles emerging from the pb ",
    "pb interactions are expected to be sensitive to the collision dynamics . in particular ,",
    "collective dynamics in the transverse direction is of major interest since it can only arise by the buildup of a pressure gradient in that direction ; this in turn would be strongly suggestive of thermal equilibration of the nuclear matter . indeed such an effect has already been observed at the highest sps and rhic energies .",
    "the shapes of the @xmath3  distributions are expected to be determined by an interplay between two effects : the thermal motion of the particles in the fireball and a pressure - driven radial flow , induced by the fireball expansion . in reference",
    "@xcite we have analyzed the @xmath4  distributions of strange particles ( , , , their anti - hyperons and ) based on the blast - wave model  @xcite , a parameterized model inspired to hydro - dynamics . due to the large number of particle species considered in that analysis , a simultaneous fit to the strange particle spectra allowed to disentangle the effect of the thermal motion from that of the collective expansion . with one particle species only , e.g. the negative pion , an oblongated confidence region can be obtained for the pair of freeze - out parameters temperature ( @xmath5 ) and average transverse flow velocity ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "a systematic study of the space - time extent and the dynamical behavior of the fireball at thermal freeze - out can be obtained via the identical particle interferometry technique , first used by hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt )  @xcite .",
    "the width of the correlation peak at vanishing relative momenta reflects the so - called length of homogeneity ( also called the `` hbt radius '' ) of the particle emitting source . only in static sources",
    "can the homogeneity length be interpreted as the true geometrical size of the system . in a dynamic system , the occurrence of space - momentum correlations of the emitted particles due to collective expansion generally leads to a reduction of the observed hbt radii .",
    "the degree of reduction depends on the gradients of the collective expansion velocity and on the thermal velocity of the particles at thermal freeze - out . a differential analysis of the hbt correlations in bins of the pair momentum ( in the longitudinal and transverse directions )",
    "thus provides valuable information both on the spatial extent and on the properties of the collective expansion of the system .",
    "combining single particle spectra and two particle hbt correlations allows us to disentangle the collective dynamics from the thermal motion relying on one particle species only .    in this paper",
    "we study the transverse mass spectra and the hbt correlation functions of unidentified negatively charged hadrons ( @xmath7 ) , which consist mainly of negative pions .",
    "descriptions of the na57 apparatus can be found in references  @xcite , and in reference  @xcite in particular for the 40 @xmath0  gev/@xmath1  set - up .",
    "the tracking device of the na57 experiment consisted of a telescope made of an array of silicon detector planes of 5x5 @xmath8  cross - section placed in an approximately uniform magnetic field of 1.4 tesla perpendicular to the beam line ; the bulk of the detectors was closely packed in an approximately 30 cm long compact part used for pattern recognition . to improve the momentum resolution of high momentum tracks a lever arm detector ( an array of four double - sided silicon micro - strip detectors )",
    "was placed downstream of the tracking telescope .",
    "the centrality of the pb - pb collisions is determined ( off - line ) by analyzing the charged particle multiplicity measured by two stations of micro - strip silicon detectors ( msd ) which sample the pseudo - rapidity intervals @xmath9  and @xmath10 .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on the analysis of the data sample collected in pb ",
    "pb collisions at 40 @xmath0  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the selected sample of events corresponds to the most central 53% of the inelastic pb ",
    "pb cross - section and has been divided into five centrality classes ( labelled with integers 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , class 4 being the most central ) according to the value of the charged particle multiplicity measured by the msd .",
    "the procedure for the measurement of the multiplicity distribution and the determination of the collision centrality for each class is described in reference  @xcite .",
    "the fractions of the inelastic cross - section for the five classes , calculated assuming an inelastic pb ",
    "pb cross - section of 7.26 barn , are the same as those used for the study of strange particles  @xcite and are given in table  [ tab : centrality ] .",
    ".centrality ranges for the five classes .",
    "[ tab : centrality ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as observed for the transverse expansion , the class 0 - 1 shows an expansion on a smaller scale , its freeze - out ( proper ) time @xmath11  being significantly shorter than for the two most central classes .",
    "it has been proposed that the existence of a strong first order phase transition and an accordingly long - lived mixed phase would be observable by a large outward radius @xmath12   compared to @xmath13 , indicating a long duration of the pion emission @xmath14",
    "@xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16  is the average transverse velocity of the pair .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath12  parameter on @xmath17  is shown in figure  [ fig : rout ] .",
    "+    we found that the ratio @xmath18 is compatible with one in the explored @xmath17  range ( figure  [ fig : ratio ] ) .",
    "values smaller than unity for this ratio can be expected for sources with surface dominated emission  @xcite , such as emission from an expanding shell .",
    "we plot the quantity @xmath19   for the individual centrality classes in figure  [ fig : deltat ] .",
    "the data do not support the scenario of a long - lived source , but more likely that of a sudden freeze - out , @xmath14  being of the order of a few fm/@xmath1 for small @xmath17  and nearly zero for high @xmath17 .",
    "in the first three rows of table  [ tab : comparison ] we have summarized the model parameters obtained from the study of @xmath7  single - particle @xmath4  spectra and two - particle correlation functions for the three centrality classes considered .",
    "these data provide implicitly a dynamical picture of the collision process .    to see",
    "if this picture is self - consistent , we can compare the two - dimensional rms width @xmath20   with the two - dimensional rms width of a cold lead nucleus @xmath21  fm .",
    "for the most central collisions ( class 3 - 4 ) , the system expands by a factor @xmath222 or , equivalently , by about 5 fm in the transverse direction",
    ". if the transverse flow velocity is equal to @xmath23  at the surface during the whole expansion , in a time of @xmath24 7.5 fm/@xmath1  nuclear matter would travel over @xmath25 5 fm in the transverse direction .",
    "this is consistent with the previous estimate from the difference @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the dynamical description of the system expansion is internally consistent .",
    "similar pictures can be drawn for the other two classes .",
    "in figure  [ fig : comp40 ] we show hbt radii versus @xmath17  measured in central pb ",
    "pb collisions at 40 @xmath0  gev/@xmath1  by various experiments .",
    "+    the overall agreement of the data is good for the @xmath13  and @xmath27  radii .",
    "a discrepancy is observed for the @xmath12  radius , with the ceres results significantly smaller than the others .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath28  depend strongly on the pair rapidity , hence a comparison with the ceres data , which are given at slightly backward rapidity , would not be straightforward . on the other hand , the agreement between na49 and na57 data , both shown at slightly forward rapidity over a similar rapidity range ,",
    "is satisfactory also for the @xmath28  parameter .",
    "na57 is the sole experiment that explores the high @xmath17  region and our data suggest that the hbt radii @xmath13 , @xmath12  and @xmath27  decrease steadily up to @xmath29  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "superimposed on the experimental data , we show in figure  [ fig : comp40 ] ( with asterisks , connected by lines ) results by qingfeng li et al .",
    "@xcite based on the urqmd v2.2 transport model  @xcite .",
    "the radii @xmath27  and @xmath13  are reasonably well in line with experimental data ; the predicted @xmath12  values are larger than those of the experimental data . as a consequence ,",
    "the extracted quantity @xmath30  of the pion emission source ( see equation  [ eq : deltatau ] ) becomes larger than the experimental evaluation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comprap ] we show the plot of the yano - koonin rapidity versus the pair rapidity , both evaluated in the centre - of - mass rest frame , as measured at different energies .",
    "figure  [ fig : comprap ] reveals a roughly universal dependence of @xmath31  on @xmath32   for pions from central collisions , depending weakly , if at all , on @xmath33 .",
    "this trend is particularly striking given the very different centre - of - mass projectile rapidities ( @xmath22 1.57 and 5.5 for @xmath33 = 5 and 200 gev , respectively ) and the corresponding widths of the pion distributions @xmath34 .",
    "the centrality dependence of hbt radii is shown in figure  [ fig : compene ] for a wide range of collision energies .",
    "the left panels show the dependence on the number of participating nucleons , @xmath35 .",
    "all of the radii exhibit a linear scaling in @xmath36 .",
    "only the slope of the @xmath27  dependence shows a significant increase from the ags to rhic , consistent with a lifetime that increases with both centrality and @xmath33 .",
    "the trend of increasing @xmath27  with increasing @xmath33 is reversed for @xmath37 5 gev  @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath12   radii from ceres at 40 @xmath0  gev/@xmath1  are well below the observed systematics .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ fig : compene ] show the same radii as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "the primary motivation for exploring the @xmath38   dependence is its relation to the final state geometry through the density at freeze - out .",
    "however , the two scaling quantities are highly correlated .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath39  shown on the right side of figure  [ fig : compene ] are derived ( as suggested in reference  @xcite ) from @xmath35  using the @xmath40  parameterizations given in  @xcite , and conversely , the @xmath35  values are often calculated from multiplicity distributions using a glauber model . given this caveat , the @xmath13  and @xmath27  values exhibit a linear dependence on @xmath38 .",
    "the similar behaviour from @xmath33 of 5 to 200 gev leads one to believe that the approximate @xmath35  scaling ( initial overlap geometry ) is a result of the scaling with multiplicity ( final freeze - out geometry ) and not the other way around .    in table",
    "[ tab : comparison ] we present , along with our results , a compilation of results on the source parameters obtained at the sps and rhic from blast - wave fits to hbt correlation functions . at all collision energies",
    "it is observed that , with increasing centrality : ( i )  the geometrical transverse dimension of the system at freeze - out , the average transverse flow , the proper time of the freeze - out and the duration of pion emission increase ; ( ii )  the thermal freeze - out temperature decreases .    with increasing @xmath33 , both the proper time of the freeze - out ( which can be assumed as the duration of the expansion ) and the average transverse flow velocity increase , thus resulting in a stronger increase of the transverse radius parameter @xmath41   at the freeze - out :",
    "after a faster expansion which lasts longer , the system ends up showing much larger spatial extent .",
    "the freeze - out temperature at top rhic energy is also significantly smaller than that measured at sps for a given collision centrality .",
    "this can be explained again as due to a longer and faster expansion , which causes the system to cool down more effectively . on the other hand , similar freeze - out emission durations of a few fm/@xmath1",
    "are observed independently of the collision energy .",
    "the analyses of transverse mass spectra of negatively charged hadrons and of hanbury - brown and twiss correlation functions have provided a description of the later stages of the expansion dynamics of the system formed in pb ",
    "pb collisions at 40 @xmath0  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "they have been performed over a centrality range corresponding to the most central 53% of the inelastic pb  pb cross section .    based on a model derived from hydro - dynamics ,",
    "we have determined parameters describing the spatial dimension and the dynamical / thermal state of the system , namely the transverse radius and the temperature of the fireball at kinetic freeze - out , the average velocity of the collective flow in the transverse direction , the proper time of the freeze - out and the mean duration of particle emission . for central collisions ,",
    "the system undergoes a strong collective expansion in the transverse directions , with an average velocity of about 45% of the speed of light , which lasts for about 7 fm/@xmath1 . after this expansion",
    ", the system has doubled its transverse size and it freezes out at a temperature of about 110 mev . for less central collisions , the expansion proceeds on a smaller scale ; the higher temperature at freeze - out may be interpreted as the remnant of an earlier decoupling of the expanding system .    concerning the time evolution , we have deduced that @xmath7  emission is a fast process ( @xmath42  fm/@xmath1 ) starting after @xmath437.5 fm/@xmath1  ( 5 fm/@xmath1 ) in the case of central ( semi - peripheral ) collisions , that takes places in the bulk ( i.e. it is not surface dominated ) .",
    "this resembles the decoupling process of photons in the early universe .    in the longitudinal direction ,",
    "the indications are that particles emitted at a given rapidity are produced by source elements moving collectively at the same rapidity .    the kinetic freeze - out conditions for @xmath7 , namely temperature and transverse flow , are compatible with those obtained , within the same model , by studying the @xmath4   spectra of singly - strange particles ( ,  and )  @xcite .",
    "quite universal kinetic freeze - out conditions are observed with increasing @xmath33  from sps to rhic , with moderate increases ( by less than 20% ) of the transverse flow velocity and of the duration of the expansion .",
    "the latter effect is consistent with the lower ( by @xmath2220% ) freeze - out temperatures measured at top rhic energy ( @xmath44  gev ) ; on the other hand , the combined effect of a faster and longer expansion causes the final transverse size at freeze - out to be significantly larger ( about a factor of two for central collisions ) at top rhic energy than at sps .",
