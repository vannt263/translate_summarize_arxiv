    "in his lectures in the summer of 1960 at michigan state university , alfred rnyi discussed several problems related to random sets @xcite . among them",
    "there was a problem regarding recovering a labeling of a set @xmath7 of @xmath0 distinct objects by asking random subset questions of the form `` which objects correspond to the labels in the ( random ) set @xmath8 ? '' for a given method of randomly selecting queries , rnyi s original problem asks for the typical behavior of the number of queries necessary to recover the hidden labeling .",
    "formally , the unknown labeling of the set @xmath7 is a bijection @xmath9 from @xmath7 to a set @xmath10 of labels ( necessarily with equal cardinality @xmath0 ) , and a query takes the form of a subset @xmath11 .",
    "the response to a query @xmath8 is @xmath12 .",
    "our contribution in this paper is a precise analysis of several parameters of rnyi s problem for a particular natural probabilistic model on the query sequence . in order to formulate this model",
    "precisely , it is convenient to first state a view of the process that elucidates its tree - like structure . in particular",
    ", a sequence of queries corresponds to a refinement of partitions of the set of objects , where two objects are in different partition elements if they have been distinguished by some sequence of queries .",
    "more precisely , the refinement works as follows : before any questions are asked , we have a trivial partition @xmath13 consisting of a single class ( all objects ) .",
    "inductively , if @xmath14 corresponds to the partition induced by the first @xmath15 queries , then @xmath16 is constructed from @xmath14 by splitting each element of @xmath14 into at most two disjoint subsets : those objects that are contained in the preimage of the @xmath17th query set @xmath18 and those that are not .",
    "the hidden labeling is recovered precisely when the partition of @xmath7 consists only of singleton elements .",
    "an instance of this process may be viewed as a rooted binary tree ( which we call the _ partition refinement tree _ ) in which the @xmath17th level , for @xmath19 , corresponds to the partition resulting from @xmath17 queries ; a node in a level corresponds to an element of that partition .",
    "a right child corresponds to a subset of a parent partition element that is included in the subsequent query , and a left child corresponds to a subset that is not included .",
    "see example  [ querysequenceexample ] for an illustration .",
    "[ querysequenceexample ] consider an instance of the problem where @xmath20 = \\{1 , ... , 5\\}$ ] , with labels @xmath21 respectively ( so @xmath22 ) .",
    "consider the following sequence of queries : = [ level distance=1.0 cm , sibling distance=2.5 cm ] = [ level distance=1.0 cm , sibling distance=1.5 cm ] = [ rectangle , minimum width=3pt , inner sep=0pt ] = [ circle , minimum width=3pt , fill , inner sep=0pt ]    1 .",

    "singletons are only explicitly depicted in the first level in which they appear .    in this work",
    "we consider a version of the problem in which , in every query , each label is included independently with probability @xmath1 ( the _ asymmetric case _ ) and we _ ignore inconclusive queries_. in particular , if a candidate query fails to nontrivially split some element of the previous partition , we modify the query by deciding again independently whether or not to include each label of that partition element with probability @xmath5 . we perform this modification until the resulting query splits every element of the previous partition nontrivially .",

    "our objective is to present precise probabilistic estimates of these parameters and to study the distributional behavior of @xmath2 .    the symmetric version ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) of the problem ( with a variation ) was discussed by pittel and rubin in @xcite , where they analyzed the typical value of @xmath3 . in their model , a query is constructed by deciding whether or not to include each label from @xmath10 independently with probability @xmath32 .",
    "to make the problem interesting , they added a constraint similar to ours : namely , a query is , as in our model , admissible if and only if it splits every nontrivial element of the current partition .",
    "in contrast with our model , however , pittel and rubin completely discard inconclusive queries ( rather than modifying their inconclusive subsets as we do ) . despite this difference , the model considered in @xcite is probabilistically equivalent to ours for the symmetric case .",

    "the question asked by rnyi brings some surprises . for the symmetric model ( @xmath32 ) pittel and rubin @xcite were able to prove that the number of necessary queries is with high probability ( whp )",
    "( see theorem  [ heightfilluptheorem ] ) @xmath33 in this paper , we re - establish this result using a different approach _ and _ prove that for @xmath1 the number of queries grows whp as @xmath34    where @xmath35 .",
    "note a phase transition in the second term .",
    "we show that a similar phase transition occurs in the asymptotics for @xmath4 ( see theorem  [ heightfilluptheorem ] ) : @xmath36 we then prove in theorem  [ depththeorem ] some interesting probabilistic behaviors of @xmath2 .",
    "we have @xmath37 ( in probability ) where @xmath38 , but we do not have almost sure convergence .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 appropriately normalized satisfies a central limit result , but not a local limit theorem due to some oscillations discussed below .",
    "we establish these results in a novel way by considering first the _ external profile _",
    "@xmath39 , whose analysis was , until recently , an open problem of its own ( the second and third authors gave a precise analysis of the external profile in an important range of parameters in @xcite , but the present paper requires nontrivial extensions ) .",
    "the external profile at level @xmath6 is the number of bijection elements revealed by the @xmath6th query ( one may also define the _ internal _ profile at level @xmath6 as the number of non - singleton elements of the partition immediately after the @xmath6th query ) .",
    "its study is motivated by the fact that many other parameters , including all of those that we mention here , can be written in terms of it .",
    "indeed , @xmath40=\\e[b_{n , k}]/n$ ] , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "we now discuss our new results concerning the probabilistic behavior of the external profile .",
    "we establish in @xcite precise asymptotic expressions for the expected value and variance of @xmath39 in the _ central range _ , that is , with @xmath43 , where , for any fixed @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( the left and right endpoints of this interval are associated with @xmath4 and @xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "specifically , we show that both the mean and the variance are of the same ( explicit ) polynomial order of growth ( with respect to @xmath0 ) ( see theorem  [ centralrangetheorem ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we show that both expected value and variance grow for @xmath46 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are complicated functions of @xmath50 , @xmath51 is an explicit constant , and @xmath52 is a function that is periodic in @xmath53 .",
    "the oscillations come from infinitely many regularly spaced saddle points that we observe when inverting the mellin transform of the poisson generating function of @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "finally , we prove a central limit theorem ; that is , @xmath55)}/{\\sqrt{\\var[b_{n , k } ] } } \\to \\normal(0,1 ) $ ] where @xmath56 represents the standard normal distribution .    in the present paper , we exploit the expected value analysis of @xmath39 in the central range to give precise distributional information about @xmath2 via the identity @xmath57 = \\e[b_{n , k}]/n$ ] .",
    "note that the oscillations in @xmath54 $ ] are the source of the peculiar behavior of @xmath2 .    in order to establish the most interesting results claimed in the present paper for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the analysis sketched above does not suffice : we need to estimate the mean and the variance of the external profile _ beyond",
    "_ the range @xmath45 ; in particular , for @xmath4 and @xmath3 we need expansions at the left and right side , respectively , of this range . this",
    ", it turns out , requires a novel approach and analysis , as discussed in detail in our forthcoming journal paper @xcite , leading to the announced results on the rnyi problem in ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "having described most of our main results , we mention an important equivalence pointed out by pittel and rubin @xcite . they observed that their version of the rnyi process resembles the construction of a digital tree known as a patricia trie @xcite .",
    "in fact , the authors of @xcite show that @xmath3 is probabilistically equivalent to the height ( longest path ) of a patricia trie built from @xmath0 binary sequences generated independently by a memoryless source with bias @xmath32 ( that is , with a `` 1 '' generated with probability @xmath5 ; this is often called the _ bernoulli model with bias @xmath5 _ ) ; the equivalence is true more generally , for @xmath58 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath4 is equivalent to the fillup level ( depth of the deepest full level ) , @xmath2 to the typical depth ( depth of a randomly chosen leaf ) , and @xmath39 to the external profile of the tree ( the number of leaves at level @xmath6 ; the internal profile at level @xmath6 is similarly defined as the number of non - leaf nodes at that level ) .",
    "we spell out this equivalence in the following simple claim .",
    "[ equivalencelemma ] any parameter ( in particular , @xmath59 , and @xmath39 ) of the rnyi process with bias @xmath5 that is a function of the partition refinement tree is equal in distribution to the same function of a random patricia trie generated by @xmath0 independent infinite binary strings from a memoryless source with bias @xmath58 .    in a nutshell",
    ", we couple a random patricia trie and the sequence of queries from the rnyi process by constructing both from the same sequence of binary strings from a memoryless source .",
    "we do this in such a way that the resulting patricia trie and the partition refinement tree are isomorphic with probability @xmath60 , so that parameters defined in terms of either tree structure are equal in distribution .",
    "more precisely , we start with @xmath0 independent infinite binary strings @xmath61 generated according to a memoryless source with bias @xmath5 , where each string corresponds to a unique element of the set of labels ( for simplicity , we assume that @xmath62 $ ] , and @xmath63 corresponds to @xmath17 , for @xmath64 $ ] ) .",
    "these induce a patricia trie @xmath65 , and our goal is to show that we can simulate a rnyi process using these strings , such that the corresponding tree @xmath66 is isomorphic to @xmath65 as a rooted plane oriented tree ( see example  [ querysequenceignoreexample ] ) .",
    "the basic idea is as follows : we maintain for each string @xmath63 an index @xmath67 , initially set to @xmath60 .",
    "whenever the rnyi process demands that we make a decision about whether or not to include label @xmath17 in a query , we include it if and only if @xmath68 , and then increment @xmath67 by @xmath60 .",
    "clearly , this scheme induces the correct distribution on queries .",
    "furthermore , the resulting partition refinement tree ( ignoring inconclusive queries ) is easily seen to be isomorphic to @xmath65 . since the trees are isomorphic , the parameters of interest are equal in each case .    thus , our results on these parameters for the rnyi problem directly lead to novel results on patricia tries , and vice versa .",
    "in addition to their use as data structures , patricia tries also arise as combinatorial structures which capture the behavior of various processes of interest in computer science and information theory ( e.g. , in leader election processes without trivial splits @xcite and in the solution to rnyi s problem which we study here @xcite ) .    similarly , the version of the rnyi problem that allows inconclusive queries corresponds to results on tries built on @xmath0 binary strings from a memoryless source .",
    "we thus discuss them in the literature survey below .",
    "now we briefly review known facts about patricia tries and other digital trees when built over @xmath0 independent strings generated by a memoryless source .",
    "profiles of tries in both the asymmetric and symmetric cases were studied extensively in @xcite .",
    "the expected profiles of digital search trees in both cases were analyzed in @xcite , and the variance for the asymmetric case was treated in @xcite .",
    "some aspects of trie and patricia trie profiles ( in particular , the concentration of their distributions ) were studied using probabilistic methods in @xcite .",
    "the depth in patricia for the symmetric model was analyzed in @xcite while for the asymmetric model in @xcite .",
    "the leading asymptotics for the patricia height for the symmetric bernoulli model was first analyzed by pittel @xcite ( see also @xcite for suffix trees ) .",
    "the two - term expression for the height of patricia for the symmetric model was first presented in @xcite as discussed above ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in @xcite , the second two authors of the present paper presented a precise analysis of the external profile ( including its mean , variance , and limiting distribution ) in the asymmetric case , for the range in which the profile grows polynomially .",
    "the present work relies on this previous analysis , but the analyses for @xmath3 and @xmath4 involve a significant extension , since they rely on precise asymptotics for the external profile outside this central range .    regarding methodology , the basic framework ( which we use here ) for analysis of digital tree recurrences by applying the poisson transform to derive a functional equation , converting this to an algebraic equation using the mellin transform , and then inverting using the saddle point method / singularity analysis followed by depoissonization , was worked out in @xcite and followed in @xcite . while this basic chain is common , the challenges of applying it vary dramatically between the different digital trees , and this is the case here . as we discuss later ( see ( [ pg1 ] ) and the surrounding text ) , this variation starts with the quite different forms of the poisson functional equations , which lead to unique analytic challenges .",
    "the plan for the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we formulate more precisely our problem and present our main results regarding the external profile , height , fillup level , and depth .",
    "sketches of proofs are provided in the last section ( the full proofs are provided in the journal version of this paper ) .",
    "in this section , we formulate precisely rnyi s problem and present our main results .",
    "our goal is to provide precise asymptotics for three natural parameters of the rnyi problem on @xmath0 objects with each label in a given query being included with probability @xmath58 : the number @xmath4 of queries needed to identify at least one single element of the bijection , the number @xmath3 needed to recover the bijection in its entirety , and the number @xmath2 needed to recover an element of the bijection chosen uniformly at random from the @xmath0 objects . if one wishes to determine the label for a particular object , these quantities correspond to the best , worst , and average case performance , respectively , of the random subset strategy proposed by rnyi .",
    "we call these parameters , the fillup level @xmath4 , the height @xmath3 , and the depth @xmath2 , respectively ( these names come from the corresponding quantities in random digital trees ) . one more parameter is relevant : we can present a unified analysis of our main three parameters @xmath69 and @xmath2 via the _ external profile",
    "_ @xmath39 , which is the number of elements of the bijection on @xmath0 items identified by the @xmath6th query .",
    "our analysis reveals several remarkable behaviors : the depth @xmath2 converges in probability but not almost surely and while it satisfies the central limit theorem its local limit theorem does nt hold . perhaps most interestingly ,",
    "the height @xmath3 and the fillup level @xmath4 exhibit phase transitions with respect to @xmath5 in the second term .",
    "to begin , we recall the relations of @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 to @xmath39 : @xmath70 = \\e[b_{n , k}]/n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the first and second moment methods , we can then obtain upper and lower bounds on @xmath3 and @xmath4 in terms of the moments of @xmath39 : @xmath71 \\leq \\sum_{j > k } \\e[b_{n , j } ] ,   \\ \\ \\   \\ \\       \\pr[h_n < k ] \\leq \\frac{\\var[b_{n , k}]}{\\e[b_{n , k}]^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath72 \\leq \\frac{\\var[b_{n , k}]}{\\e[b_{n , k}]^2 } , & &      \\pr[f_n < k ] \\leq \\e[b_{n , k}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the analysis of the distribution of @xmath2 reduces simply to that of @xmath54 $ ] .    in the next section , we show that the fillup level @xmath4 and the height @xmath3 have the following precise asymptotic expansions .",
    "both exhibit a phase transition with respect to @xmath5 in the second term .",
    "a complete proof can be found in our journal version of this paper @xcite .",
    "[ heightfilluptheorem ] with high probability , @xmath73 and @xmath74 for large @xmath0 .",
    "while the behavior of the fillup level @xmath4 could be anticipated @xcite ( by comparing it to the corresponding result in the version of rnyi s problem allowing inconclusive queries ) , the behavior of the height @xmath3 is rather more unusual .",
    "it is difficult to compare the height result to the analogous quantity for tries or digital search trees , because only the first term is given for @xmath1 in the literature : for tries , it is @xmath75 , while for digital search trees it is @xmath76 , as in patricia tries .",
    "focusing on the second term of each expression given in the theorem , this result says that the deviation of the typical height from @xmath76 is asymptotically larger when @xmath32 than when @xmath1 .",
    "that is , the height of the tallest fringe subtree ( i.e. , a subtree rooted near @xmath76 ) is asymptotically larger in the symmetric case",
    ". a complete explanation of this phenomenon would likely require consideration of the number of such subtrees ( i.e. , the internal profile at level @xmath76 ) and the number of strings participating in each of them . in the language of the rnyi problem , this latter parameter is the number of objects that remain unidentified after approximately @xmath76 queries .",
    "moving to the number of questions @xmath2 needed to identify a random element of the bijection , we have the following theorem ( note that due to the evolution process of the random patricia trie , all random variables can be defined on the same probability space ) .",
    "[ depththeorem ] for @xmath1 , the normalized depth @xmath77 converges in probability to @xmath78 , where @xmath38 is the bernoulli entropy function , but not almost surely .",
    "in fact , @xmath79 furthermore , @xmath2 satisfies a central limit theorem ; that is , @xmath80)/\\sqrt{\\var[d_n ] } \\to \\normal(0 , 1)$ ] , where @xmath81 \\sim \\frac{1}{h(p)}\\log n$ ] and @xmath82 \\sim c\\log n$ ] where @xmath83 is an explicit constant .",
    "limit theorem does not hold : for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is some explicit constant and @xmath87 , we obtain @xmath88 ~h(-1;_p / q p^kn ) @xmath88 for an oscillating function @xmath89 ( see figure  [ hfigure ] ) defined in theorem  [ centralrangetheorem ] below and an explicitly known constant @xmath51 .    0.375   for @xmath90 . , title=\"fig : \" ]    0.375   for @xmath90 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    0.375   for @xmath90 . ,",
    "title=\"fig : \" ]    again , the depth exhibits a phase transition : for @xmath32 we have @xmath91 almost surely , which does nt hold for @xmath1 .",
    "we note that some of the results on the depth ( namely , the convergence in probability and the central limit theorem ) are already known ( see @xcite ) , but our contribution is a novel derivation of these facts via the profile analysis .",
    "qualitatively , the oscillatory behavior of the external profile that is responsible for the lack of local limit theorem for the depth occurs also in both tries and digital search trees .",
    "we now explain our approach to the analysis of the moments of @xmath39 in appropriate ranges ( we follow @xcite ) . for this , we take an analytic approach @xcite . we first explain it for the analysis relevant to @xmath2 , and then show how to extend it for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "more details can be found in the next section .",
    "we start by deriving a recurrence for the average profile , which we denote by @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "it satisfies @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , with some initial / boundary conditions ; most importantly , @xmath96 for @xmath97 and any @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath98 for all @xmath0 and @xmath6 owing to the elimination of inconclusive queries .",
    "this recurrence arises from conditioning on the number @xmath17 of objects that are included in the first query .",
    "if @xmath99 objects are included , then the conditional expectation is a sum of contributions from those objects that are included and those that are nt .",
    "if , on the other hand , all objects are included or all are excluded from the first potential query ( which happens with probability @xmath100 ) , then the partition element splitting constraint on the queries applies , the potential query is ignored as inconclusive , and the contribution is @xmath101 .",
    "the tools that we use to solve this recurrence ( for details see @xcite ) are similar to those of the analyses for digital trees @xcite such as tries and digital search trees ( though the analytical details differ significantly ) .",
    "we first derive a functional equation for the poisson transform @xmath102 of @xmath101 , which gives @xmath103 this we write as @xmath104 we contrast this functional equation with those for tries @xcite and for digital search trees @xcite : in tries , the expression @xmath105 does not appear , which significantly simplifies the analysis in that case . in digital search trees ,",
    "the functional equation is a differential equation , and the analysis is consequently quite different .    at this point",
    "the goal is to determine asymptotics for @xmath106 as @xmath107 in a cone around the positive real axis .",
    "when solving ( [ pg1 ] ) , @xmath105 complicates the analysis because it has no closed - form mellin transform ( see below ) ; we handle it via its taylor series .",
    "finally , depoissonization @xcite will allow us to transfer the asymptotic expansion for @xmath106 back to one for @xmath101 : @xmath108    to convert ( [ pg1 ] ) to an algebraic equation , we use the _ mellin transform _",
    "@xcite , which , for a function @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 using the mellin transform identities and defining @xmath111 , we end up with an expression for the mellin transform @xmath112 of @xmath106 of the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 ( see ( [ a_kdefinition ] ) below ) is an infinite series arising from the contributions coming from the function @xmath105 : @xmath115 where we define @xmath116 for all @xmath117 . note that it involves @xmath118 for various @xmath117 and @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) . locating and characterizing the singularities of @xmath112 then becomes important .",
    "we find that , for any @xmath6 , @xmath114 is entire , with zeros at @xmath119 $ ] , so that @xmath112 is meromorphic , with possible simple poles at the negative integers less than @xmath120 .",
    "the fundamental strip of @xmath106 then contains @xmath121 .",
    "it turns out that the main asymptotic contribution comes from an infinite number of saddle points ( see ( [ saddlepoints ] ) below ) defined by the kernel @xmath122 .",
    "we then must asymptotically invert the mellin transform to recover @xmath106 . the mellin inversion formula for @xmath112",
    "is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is any real number inside the fundamental strip associated with @xmath106 .",
    "for @xmath6 in the range in which the profile grows polynomially ( that coincides with the range of interest in our analysis of @xmath2 ) , we evaluate this integral via the saddle point method @xcite . examining @xmath125 and solving the associated saddle point equation @xmath126 = 0,\\ ] ]",
    "we find an explicit formula ( [ rhodefinition ] ) below for @xmath49 , the real - valued saddle point of our integrand .",
    "the multivaluedness of the complex logarithm then implies that there are _ infinitely many _ regularly spaced saddle points @xmath127 , @xmath128 , on this vertical line : @xmath129 these lead directly to oscillations in the @xmath130 factor in the final asymptotics for @xmath101 ) .",
    "the main challenge in completing the saddle point analysis is then to elucidate the behavior of @xmath131 for @xmath132 along vertical lines : it turns out that this function inherits the exponential decay of @xmath133 along vertical lines , and we prove it by splitting the sum defining @xmath114 into two pieces , which decay exponentially for different reasons ( the first sum decays as a result of the superexponential decay of @xmath134 for @xmath135 , which is outside the main range of interest ) .",
    "we end up with an asymptotic expansion for @xmath106 as @xmath107 in terms of @xmath114 .",
    "finally , we must analyze the convergence properties of @xmath114 as @xmath136 .",
    "we find that it converges uniformly on compact sets to a function @xmath137 ( see ( [ a_kdefinition ] ) ) which is , because of the uniformity , entire .",
    "we then apply lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem to conclude that we can replace @xmath114 with @xmath137 in the final asymptotic expansion of @xmath106 .",
    "all of this yields the following theorem which is proved in @xcite .    [ centralrangetheorem ]",

    "furthermore , for the height and fillup level analyses we need to extend theorem  [ centralrangetheorem ] beyond its original central range for @xmath50 , as discussed in the next section .",
    "now we give sketches of the proofs of theorems  [ heightfilluptheorem ] and [ depththeorem ] with more details regarding the proof of theorem  [ heightfilluptheorem ] in the forthcoming journal version @xcite .",
    "in particular , in this conference version , we only sketch derivations for @xmath3 and for @xmath4 by upper and lower bounding , respectively .",
    "as stated earlier , the proof of theorem  [ centralrangetheorem ] can be found in @xcite .        .",
    "fixing any @xmath44 , we write , for the lower bound on the height , @xmath154 and , for the upper bound , @xmath155 for a function @xmath156 which we are to determine . in order for the first and second moment methods to work ,",
    "we require @xmath157 and @xmath158 ( we additionally need that @xmath159 = o(\\mu_{n , k_l}^2)$ ] , but this is not too hard to show by induction using the recurrence for @xmath160 , the poisson variance of @xmath39 . ) in order to identify the @xmath161 at which this transition occurs , we define @xmath162 , and the plan is to estimate @xmath54 $ ] via the integral representation ( [ mellininversionformula ] ) for its poisson transform .",
    "specifically , we consider the inverse mellin integrand for some @xmath163 to be set later .",
    "this is sufficient for the upper bound , since , by the exponential decay of the @xmath164 function , the entire integral is at most of the same order of growth as the integrand on the real axis .",
    "we expand the integrand in ( [ mellininversionformula ] ) , that is , @xmath165 and apply a simple extension of theorem  2.2 , part ( iii ) of @xcite to approximate @xmath166 when @xmath167 and is close enough to @xmath117 :        now , we continue with the evaluation of ( [ j_kformula ] ) .",
    "the @xmath17th term of ( [ j_kformula ] ) is then of order @xmath177 where we set @xmath178 the factor @xmath179 ensures that the bounded @xmath17 terms are negligible .",
    "our next goal is to find the @xmath17 which gives the dominant contribution to the sum in ( [ j_kformula ] ) ; that is , the @xmath17 for which the contributions @xmath180 dominate . by elementary calculus , we can find the @xmath17 term which minimizes @xmath181 : @xmath182 then @xmath183 for this value of @xmath17 becomes @xmath184 we then minimize over all @xmath185 , which requires us to split into the symmetric and asymmetric cases .",
    "when @xmath186 , we have @xmath187 , so that the expression for @xmath183 simplifies , and we get @xmath188 .",
    "the optimal value for @xmath183 then becomes @xmath189 we have thus succeeded in finding a likely candidate for the range of @xmath17 terms that contribute maximally , as well as an upper bound on their contribution .",
    "this gives a tight upper bound on @xmath190 and , hence , on @xmath191 , of @xmath192 .",
    "now , to find @xmath161 for which there is a phase transition in this bound from tending to @xmath193 to tending to @xmath194 , we set the exponent in the above expression equal to zero and solve for @xmath161 .",
    "this gives @xmath195 as expected .      on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath1 , the equation that we need to solve to find the minimizing value of @xmath185 for ( [ optimalnu ] ) is a bit more complicated , owing to the fact that @xmath196 now depends on @xmath185 : taking a derivative with respect to @xmath185 in ( [ optimalnu ] ) and setting this equal to @xmath194 , after some algebra , we must solve @xmath197 for @xmath185 . here",
    ", we note that we used the approximation @xmath198 which is valid since we are looking for @xmath199 .",
    "to find a solution to ( [ solvefors ] ) , we first note that it implies that @xmath200 ( since the first term involving @xmath201 is negative ) , and , if @xmath202 , this implies that @xmath203 the plan , then , is to use this to guess a solution @xmath185 for ( [ solvefors ] ) , which we can then verify .",
    "the equality ( [ psisinequality ] ) suggests that we replace @xmath204 with @xmath205 in ( [ solvefors ] ) , for some constant @xmath175 .",
    "then the equation becomes @xmath206 after some trivial rearrangement and multiplication of both sides by @xmath207 , we get @xmath208 setting @xmath209 brings us to an expression of the form that defines the lambert @xmath210 function @xcite ( i.e. , a function @xmath211 satisfying @xmath212 ) .    using the asymptotics of the @xmath210 function for large @xmath213 @xcite , we thus find that @xmath214 note that @xmath199 , as required .",
    "this may be plugged into ( [ optimalnu ] ) to see that it is indeed a solution to the equation .",
    "now , to find the correct choice of @xmath161 for which there is a phase transition , we plug this choice of @xmath185 into ( [ optimalnu ] ) , set it equal to @xmath194 , and solve for @xmath161 .",
    "this gives @xmath215 as desired .",
    "note that replacing @xmath161 in ( [ optimalnu ] ) with @xmath216 yields a maximum contribution to the inverse mellin integral of @xmath217 when we replace @xmath161 with @xmath218 , we get @xmath219 so that the upper bound tends to infinity ( in @xcite , we prove a matching lower bound ) .",
    "the above analysis gives asymptotic estimates for @xmath220 .",
    "we then apply analytic depoissonization @xcite to get @xmath221 ( where the second term can be handled in the same way as the first ) .",
    "this gives the claimed result .    .",
    "we now set @xmath222 and @xmath223 here , @xmath156 is to be determined so as to satisfy @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "we use a technique similar to that used in the height proof to determine @xmath161 , except now the @xmath164 function asymptotics play a role , since we will choose @xmath226 tending to @xmath193 . our first task is to upper bound ( as tightly as possible ) , for each @xmath17 , the magnitude of the @xmath17th term of ( [ j_kformula ] ) .",
    "first , we upper bound @xmath227 using the boundary conditions on @xmath134 .",
    "next , we apply stirling s formula to get @xmath228 multiplying ( [ am1 ] ) and ( [ am2 ] ) , then optimizing over all @xmath229 , we find that the maximum term of the @xmath117 sum occurs at @xmath230 and has a value of @xmath231 now , observe that when @xmath232 , the contribution of the @xmath117th term is @xmath233 .",
    "thus , setting @xmath234 ( note that @xmath235 ) , we split the @xmath117 sum into two parts : @xmath236 the terms of the initial part can be upper bounded by ( [ am3 ] ) , while those of the final part are upper bounded by @xmath237 ( so that the final part is the tail of a geometric series ) . this gives an upper bound of @xmath238 which holds for any @xmath17 .    multiplying this by @xmath239 gives @xmath240 maximizing over the @xmath17 terms , we find that the largest contribution comes from @xmath241 .",
    "then , just as in the height upper bound , the behavior with respect to @xmath124 depends on whether or not @xmath242 , because @xmath243 when @xmath244 and is dependent on @xmath124 otherwise .",
    "taking this into account and minimizing over @xmath124 gives that the maximum contribution to the @xmath17 sum is minimized by setting @xmath245 when @xmath244 and @xmath246 otherwise .",
    "plugging these choices for @xmath124 into the exponent of ( [ am4 ] ) , setting it equal to @xmath194 , and solving for @xmath161 gives @xmath247 when @xmath244 and @xmath248 when @xmath249 .",
    "the evaluation of the inverse mellin integral with @xmath250 as defined in ( [ k_lk_ufillup ] ) and the integration contour given by @xmath251 proceeds along lines similar to the height proof , and this yields the desired result .",
    "we remark that the lower bound for @xmath4 may also be derived by relating it to the analogous quantity in regular tries : by definition of the fillup level , there are no unary paths above the fillup level in a standard trie .",
    "thus , when converting the corresponding patricia trie , no path compression occurs above this level , which implies that @xmath4 for patricia is lower bounded by that of tries ( and the typical value for tries is the same as in our theorem for patricia ) .",
    "we include the lower bound for @xmath4 via the bounding of the inverse mellin integral because it is similar in flavor to the corresponding proof of the upper bound ( for which no short proof seems to exist ) .          for the typical value of @xmath2",
    ", we show that @xmath252 \\xrightarrow{n\\to\\infty } 0 , & &      \\pr[d_n",

    ", we consider the following sequences of events : @xmath259 is the event that @xmath260 , and @xmath261 is the event that @xmath262 .",
    "we note that all elements of the sequences are independent , and @xmath263 , \\pr[a'_n ] \\geq 1/n$ ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath264 = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\pr[a'_n ] = \\infty$ ] , so that the borel - cantelli lemma tells us that both @xmath259 and @xmath261 occur infinitely often almost surely ( moreover , @xmath265 by definition of the relevant quantities ) .",
    "this proves ( [ d_nnoalmostsure ] ) .    to show",
    "the claimed almost sure convergence of @xmath266 and @xmath267 , we can not apply the borel - cantelli lemmas directly , because the relevant sums do not converge .",
    "instead , we apply a trick which was used in @xcite .",
    "we observe that both @xmath268 and @xmath269 are non - decreasing sequences .",
    "next , we show that , on some appropriately chosen subsequence , both of these sequences , when divided by @xmath201 , converge almost surely to their respective limits . combining this with the observed monotonicity yields",
    "the claimed almost sure convergence , and , hence , the equalities in ( [ d_nnoalmostsure ] ) .",
    "we illustrate this idea more precisely for @xmath3 . by our analysis above , we know that @xmath270 = o(e^{-\\theta(\\log\\log n)^2}).\\ ] ] then we fix @xmath271 , and we define @xmath272 . on this subsequence , by the probability bound",
    "just stated , we can apply the borel - cantelli lemma to conclude that @xmath273 almost surely .",
    "moreover , for every @xmath0 , we can choose @xmath274 such that @xmath275 . then @xmath276 which implies @xmath277 taking @xmath278",
