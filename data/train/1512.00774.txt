    "among the achievements of hera , one of the major results was the experimental evidence @xcite that among the whole set of @xmath0 deep inelastic scattering events , almost 10% are diffractive ( ddis ) , of the form @xmath1 with a rapidity gap between the proton remnants @xmath2 and the hadrons @xmath3 coming from the fragmentation region of the initial virtual photon .",
    "there are two main approaches to theoretically describe diffraction .",
    "the first one involves a _ resolved _ pomeron contribution , see fig .",
    "[ resdirect ] ( left ) , while the second one relies on a _ direct _ pomeron contribution involving the coupling of a pomeron with the diffractive state , see fig .",
    "[ resdirect ] ( right ) .        for moderate invariant mass @xmath4 of the diffractively produced state @xmath3 ,",
    "such a state can be modeled in perturbation theory by a @xmath5 pair , or by higher fock states as a @xmath6 state for larger values of @xmath4 .",
    "based on such a model , with a two - gluon exchange picture for the pomeron , a good description of hera data for diffraction  @xcite could be achieved  @xcite . in the direct components considered there , the @xmath6",
    "diffractive state has been studied in two particular limits .",
    "the first one , valid for very large @xmath7 , corresponds to a collinear approximation in which the transverse momentum of the gluon is assumed to be much smaller than the transverse momentum of the emitter  @xcite .",
    "the second one  @xcite , valid for very large @xmath4 , is based on the assumption of a strong ordering of longitudinal momenta , encountered in bfkl equation  @xcite . both these approaches were combined in order to describe hera data for ddis  @xcite",
    ".    it would be natural to extend the hera studies to similar hard diffractive events at lhc .",
    "the idea here is to adapt the concept of photoproduction of diffractive jets , which was performed at hera  @xcite , now with a flux of quasi - real photons in ultraperipheral collisions ( upc )  @xcite , relying on the notion of equivalent photon approximation . in both cases ,",
    "the hard scale is provided by the invariant mass of the tagged jets .",
    "we here report on our computation  @xcite of the @xmath8 impact factor at tree level with an arbitrary number of @xmath9-channel gluons described within the wilson line formalism , also called qcd shockwave approach  @xcite . as an aside , we rederive the @xmath10 impact factor .",
    "in particular , the @xmath8 transition is computed without any soft or collinear approximation for the emitted gluon , in contrast with the above mentioned calculations .",
    "these results provide a necessary generalization of building blocks for inclusive ddis ( of potential significant phenomenological importance  @xcite ) as well as for two- and three - jet diffractive production .",
    "balitsky s shockwave formalism is very powerful in determining evolution equations and impact factors at next - to - leading order for inclusive processes  @xcite , at semi - inclusive level for @xmath11-broadening in @xmath12 collisions  @xcite or in the evaluation of the triple pomeron vertex beyond the planar limit  @xcite , when compared with usual methods based on summation of contributions of individual feynman diagrams computed in momentum space .",
    "it is an effective way of estimating the effect of multigluon exchange , formulated in coordinate space and thus natural in view of describing saturation  @xcite .",
    "we introduce the light cone vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14@xmath15 and the wilson lines as @xmath16\\ , .",
    "\\label{wl}\\ ] ] the operator @xmath17 is the external shock - wave field built from slow gluons whose momenta are limited by the longitudinal cut - off defined by the rapidity @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the typical large @xmath21 momentum of the problem , to be identified with @xmath22 later on .",
    "we will denote the longitudinal cut - off @xmath23    we use the light cone gauge @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the sum of the external field @xmath26 and the quantum field @xmath27@xmath28 where @xmath29 is a profile function .",
    "indeed , let us consider an external gluon field @xmath30 in its rest frame and boost it along the @xmath21 direction .",
    "one obtains : @xmath31 assuming that the field vanishes at infinity , one immediately gets that only its minus component survives the boost in the limit @xmath32 and that it does not depend on @xmath33 and contains @xmath34 thus justifying the form of @xmath35 in eq .",

    "we use intensively in the following the dipole operator constructed from the wilson line ( [ wl ] ) , namely @xmath36",
    "at leading order , the diagram contributing to the impact factor for @xmath37 transition is shown in fig . [ leading ] ,",
    "in which @xmath38 denote the coordinates of interaction points with the photon and the shock wave .",
    "after projection on the color singlet state and subtraction of the contribution without interaction with the shock wave , the contribution of this diagram can be written in the momentum space as ( factorizing out a global qed factor @xmath39 ) @xmath40 denoting @xmath41 , we get for a longitudinally polarized photon @xmath42 whereas for a transversally polarized photon @xmath43",

    "the explicit expressions for the functions @xmath47 for both longitudinally and transversally polarized photon can be found in ref .",
    "we first notice that the dipole operator @xmath48 involves terms at least of order @xmath49 .",

    "they are otherwise expressible as a simple convergent integral over the interval @xmath53 $ ] .",

    "the diagrams contributing to virtual corrections in which the radiated gluon does not cross the shock wave are shown in fig .",
    "[ nlo ] , and the diagrams in which the radiated gluon interacts with the shock wave are illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ nlosw ] .",
    "one should note that although these virtual corrections only involve one - loop diagrams , the complications arise due to the presence of many different scales .",
    "indeed , our aim is to obtain results in the general kinematics where the virtuality of incoming photon , the @xmath54channel momentum transfer and the invariant mass @xmath4 of the diffractive two - jet state are arbitrary . additionally , this impact factor is a function of the virtuality of @xmath54channel exchanged gluons .",
