    "infectious diseases are transmitted through social contacts between individuals .",
    "the relationships between the structure of social networks and the number of infected individuals have been extensively studied in mathematical epidemiology and network sciences .",
    "such studies have established that heterogeneity in contact rates enhances epidemics @xcite .",
    "the contact networks underlying , for example , sexually transmitted diseases of humans and computer viruses on the internet are considered to be static on the time scale of epidemics .",
    "however , the social networks underlying humans prevailing infectious diseases such as influenza are presumably dynamic even during a day .",
    "the dynamics of networks are induced by the migration of individuals among residences , workplaces , places for social activities , and so on .",
    "other animals also migrate between habitats .",
    "metapopulation models are useful in describing epidemics and ecological invasions in such a situation @xcite .",
    "a node in such a model represents a metapopulation or a habitat , and not an individual .",
    "a link represents a physical pathway connecting a pair of metapopulations .",
    "individuals travel from one node to another .",
    "simultaneously , interactions between individuals , such as infection , can occur in each metapopulation .",
    "the basic reproduction number and the condition for the occurrence of global epidemics have been theoretically determined for the susceptible - infected - suscepetible ( sis ) dynamics and its variants on metapopulation networks with general connectivity profiles @xcite .",
    "real metapopulation networks relevant to epidemics , such as networks of urban metapopulations and networks of airports , often have heterogeneous degree distributions ; some metapopulations are highly connected as compared to many others @xcite .",
    "colizza et al .",
    "put important efforts for understanding infectious dynamics on complex metapopulation networks @xcite . in particular , they showed that heterogeneous degree distributions enhance epidemics in uncorrelated networks of metapopulations ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "similar results have been established for models of epidemics on static networks of individuals ( see @xcite for reviews ) . however , the relationship between the epidemic threshold of the infection rate ( or population density ) above which large epidemics can occur and the degree distribution differs in these two classes of models .    for metapopulation models , effects of stochasticity in infection , recovery , and migration dynamics were also analyzed in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "other authors also investigated the threshold for infection and epidemic dynamics in uncorrelated heterogeneous networks of metapopulations @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the effect of diffusion on epidemics in metapopulation networks on which individuals diffuse .",
    "diffusion increases the possibility of epidemics for the sis model @xcite and its variants @xcite in conventional static networks of individuals .",
    "this is presumably because diffusion helps infected individuals to contact new susceptibles to be infected .",
    "the effect of traffic - driven diffusion on the epidemic threshold was also studied recently @xcite .",
    "we show that for epidemics in metapopulation networks , diffusion prohibits rather than enhances epidemic spreads in the sense of the epidemic threshold .",
    "although this result has been implicitly recognized in previous literature @xcite , we show it by developing an analytical method to calculate the epidemic threshold for arbitrary networks and diffusion rates .",
    "we then support this result by numerical simulations and further show that an intermediate diffusion rate magnifies epidemics near the epidemic threshold .",
    "qualitatively identical behavior is observed in numerical simulations of the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) dynamics on metapopulation networks .",
    "we assume connected and undirected networks of metapopulations ; extending the following results to the case of weighted networks is straightforward .",
    "each node represents a metapopulation or habitat and accommodates any number of individuals . for a network having @xmath0 nodes , the @xmath0 by @xmath0 adjacency matrix",

    "we consider the sis dynamics of diffusive individuals on this network using the continuous - time formulation developed in @xcite .",
    "the use of the original discrete - time formulation of the model @xcite does not essentially change the following results .",
    "the network contains @xmath8 individuals that independently diffuse on the network .",
    "each individual stays at a node and takes either a susceptible or an infectious state .",
    "the sis dynamics with infection rate @xmath9 and recovery rate @xmath10 occur in each metapopulation .",
    "we assume mass interaction and therefore do not normalize the infection rate by the number of individuals in the metapopulation @xcite . by doing so ,",
    "we focus on situations in which metapopulations that host relatively many individuals would be a source of epidemics once an infected individual is introduced to such a metapopulation .",
    "the infection event at node @xmath3 occurs at a rate of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the numbers of susceptible and infected individuals at node @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "this assumption implies all - to - all interaction within each metapopulation .    at the same time",
    ", individuals perform a simple random walk . in infinitesimal time @xmath14 , a susceptible ( infected ) individual at node @xmath3 with degree @xmath15 moves to one of its neighboring nodes with equal probability @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the diffusion rate for the susceptible ( infected ) individual and @xmath15 is the degree of node @xmath3 .",
    "we derive the epidemic threshold above which the endemic state ( _ i.e. _ , survival of infected individuals ) can occur .",
    "although general solutions have been formulated @xcite and solutions are known for uncorrelated random networks @xcite , we are concerned with the effect of the diffusion rate on the epidemic threshold in general heterogeneous networks .",

    "given @xmath23 , the steady state for the number of susceptible individuals is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the average degree and @xmath26 , the total population density .",
    "substituting eq .   in eq .",

    "the destabilization of the disease - free solution implies an endemic state , that is , @xmath29 ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "we focus on the threshold value of @xmath9 above which the endemic state is induced , which is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "we note that the threshold obtained below can also be expressed in terms of @xmath31 , as is done in previous literature @xcite , because @xmath9 and @xmath31 appear only as the multiple @xmath32 in eq .  .",
    "in the strong diffusion limit @xmath33 , eq .   implies @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total density of the infected individual . by substituting eq .   in eq .   and",
    "taking the summation over @xmath3 , we obtain @xmath36 which reproduces the threshold @xmath37 known for uncorrelated networks @xcite .",

    "in heterogeneous networks , we obtain @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath30 for @xmath38 is smaller than that of @xmath30 for @xmath33 .",
    "although this fact apparently indicates that the endemic state occurs more easily for @xmath38 than for @xmath33 , this statement is somewhat misleading because @xmath38 implies that the infection does not travel across metapopulations .",
    "when @xmath38 , the infection is confined in the metapopulations that contain index patients .",
    "assume that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are arbitrary .",
    "we develop a method to calculate the epidemic threshold for an arbitrary structure of networks and diffusion rates .",

    "when the real parts of all the @xmath0 eigenvalues of @xmath47 are negative , the disease - free solution is stable .",

    "the nonmonotonic dependence of the fraction of infected individuals on the diffusion rate near the epidemic threshold is derived from the fact that epidemics confined in a single metapopulation are irrelevant on the global scale .",
