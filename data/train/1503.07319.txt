    "the negative refraction index media , first considered by veselago @xcite , and recently realized in the form of metamaterials  @xcite exhibit many fascinating properties @xcite and potential applications such as imaging beyond the diffraction limit @xcite . in such materials , commonly called left - handed media ( lhm ) due to left - handed triada of vectors @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of propagating waves , many usual optical phenomena become reversed , however some of them are unreversed , just to mention the so - called rotational doppler effect @xcite as well as the spin hall effect in lhm @xcite .",
    "the class of reversed phenomena includes refraction @xcite , goos - hnchen shift  @xcite and the doppler effect @xcite .",
    "the reversed doppler shift has been observed in a variety of systems such as magnetic thin film  @xcite , photonic crystals  @xcite , transmission lines  @xcite and acoustical metamaterials  @xcite . in dispersive media ,",
    "the so - called complex doppler effect occurs , when a monochromatic source generates wave modes of multiple frequencies @xcite .",
    "another example of reversed phenomena in lhm is the cherenkov effect @xcite .",
    "this radiation , which was discovered experimentally in 1934 by cherenkov @xcite and later described theoretically by frank and tamm @xcite occurs when a charged particle moves at a speed exceeding the phase velocity of the waves in a medium and has been extensively applied for particle detection . in usual , right - handed materials ,",
    "the angle of radiation is smaller than @xmath3 , so that the energy is emitted in the forward direction .",
    "one of the important feature of negative index materials is a negative value of the phase velocity so the cherenkov effect is reversed and the waves are emitted in backward direction @xcite .",
    "it has been observed experimentally by xi _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "the cherenkov radiation in lhm has been studied by lu _",
    "@xcite for both lossless and lossy cases and they found that maintaining a forward @xmath4 vector of radiation in negative index media exhibits a backward emission .",
    "an elegant review of cherenkov radiation in photonic crystals describing a backward - pointing radiation cone and backward direction of emission was presented by luo _",
    "more recently in @xcite it was pointed out that the reversed cherenkov radiation has a distinct advantage which allows the photons and charged particle to naturally separate in opposite directions , minimizing their interference .",
    "nowadays there is a considerable interest in developing a new class of velocity - sensitive particle detectors based on left - handed materials @xcite which can be used to enhance the radiation @xcite or control its emission angle @xcite .",
    "here we present a simple , unified analytical description of the doppler and cherenkov phenomena in an idealized , dispersive medium .",
    "the description of the complex doppler effect presented in our previous paper @xcite is extended to the two - dimensional case .",
    "it is shown that a moving , monochromatic source generates two distinct frequency modes and the generated field exhibits features of both the doppler and the cherenkov effects . starting from the first principles , we are able to explain the angular distribution of the energy for the fast and slow frequency modes of the two - dimensional , complex doppler effect in lhm",
    ". moreover , the reversed cherenkov radiation emerges as a particular case of the presented theory as the source with the frequency @xmath5 is shown to be formally equivalent to a moving charge .",
    "the intrinsic feature of the reversed cherenkov effect in the considered lhm is the lack of a source velocity threshold above which this phenomenon occurs .",
    "this fact is explained in a general way and is shown to have a different origin than in the case of periodic media such as nanowire structures @xcite .",
    "the theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations based on the finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) method which is a common tool in the study of electromagnetic wave propagation in various media @xcite .",
    "the performed numerical simulations are in agreement with our theoretical predictions based on the first principle approach .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the theory of the complex doppler effect in two - dimensional lhm , section 3 is devoted to the description of the simulation setup . a spatial structure of fields emitted by a moving source characterized by nonzero and zero frequency , describing the complex doppler and the reversed cherenkov effect respectively ,",

    "conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "finally , in appendix a we prove that the cherenkov cone angle varies only within small interval and is almost insensible to the source velocity .",

    "the lorentz contraction and other factors affecting the field amplitude can be disregarded , as the following discussion of the radiation intensity is qualitative in nature and the relativistic effects at the considered speeds are not significant .    the simulation space is divided into 300x300 grid and is surrounded by absorbing boundaries to reduce reflections .",
    "the frequency @xmath43 was chosen to minimize the effect of the numerical dispersion and anisotropy @xcite .",
    "this is especially important in the case of a dispersive medium described above , where the high frequency modes are limited by the finite time step , and the low frequency , short wavelength modes are constrained by the spatial step .",
    "let s assume that the moving source emits a quasi - monochromatic wave packet with central frequency @xmath43 . according to eq .",

    "also , the transverse doppler shift for the waves emitted in a direction perpendicular to the source motion is caused only by the relativistic effects , so in the low velocity regime @xmath69 .",
