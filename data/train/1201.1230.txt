    "study of the electron transport through nanoscopic systems remains one of the most active areas of contemporary condensed matter physics .",
    "most of the theoretical research has been done so far with the use of keldysh nonequilibrium green s functions ( negf )  @xcite and scattering theory based approaches  @xcite .",
    "negf applications to electron transport were pioneered by caroli et al.@xcite in early 1970s .",
    "keldysh negf become particularly useful in the development of systematic perturbation theories for electron - vibronic and electron - electron interactions in the current - carrying nanosystem . in particular , nonequilibrium effects originated from electron - vibration coupling have attracted a lot of attention recently because of their importance in single - molecule electronics   @xcite .",
    "various kinds of perturbation theories to deal with electronic correlations have been also recently developed  @xcite .",
    "the electron transport through the system of interacting electrons ( either with themselves or with some vibrational fields ) involves two different energy scales : one energy scale is related to the tunneling coupling between the nanosystem and macroscopic leads and the second one is the strength of the interactions inside the nanosystems .",
    "negf usually treats the tunneling interaction exactly , but it has to rely on various types of perturbative calculations to account for correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "the approaches based on kinetic equations are able to treat the correlations inside the nanosystem very accurately ( even exactly in the case of simple model systems ) but the tunneling part is usually taken into account in the second or sometimes higher orders perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "this immediately rules out the application of kinetic equations to the one of the most interesting transport regimes when there is no energy scale separation between coupling to the electrode and the correlations in the the systems ( in other words , to the case when the tunneling time for electron becomes comparable with the characteristic time for the development of correlations in the dot ) .",
    "our approach to the use of kinetic equations for electron transport is different and will be elaborated in details in the sec .",
    "[ lindblad_kinetic_equation ] .",
    "we begin with relatively simple kinetic equation of the lindblad type , but we make it exact for the nonequilibrium steady state by the introduction of the finite buffer zones between the quantum dot and macroscopic leads ( so called embedding of the quantum dot )  @xcite . to fully link transport kinetic equations with the many - body methods we transform it to liouville - fock ( or super - fock ) space and it becomes equivalent to effective non - hermitian field theory with the right vacuum vector , which corresponds to nonequilibrium steady state density matrix .",
    "this combination of the embedding and the use of liouville - fock space enables us to overcome the usual limitations of the kinetic equation based approaches .",
    "the main goal of the paper is mostly methodological .",
    "namely , we develop nonequilibrium perturbation theory in terms of electron - vibronic and electron - electron interaction and test our theory against the negf results obtained for out of equilibrium local holstein and anderson models .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ lindblad_kinetic_equation ] , we derive the lindblad equation for embedded quantum dot and discuss the underlying approximations . in sec .",
    "[ lindblad_kinetic_equation ] , we also describe superoperator formalism and convert the kinetic equation to non - hermitian field theory in liouville - fock space . section  [ perturbative_calculations ] presents the main equations of nonequilibrium many - body perturbation theory , applications to local holstein and anderson models , and comparison with negf .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "we use natural units throughout the paper : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electron charge .",
    "we begin by considering a quantum system ( e.g. quantum dot , molecule , etc ) connected to two electrodes , left and right , with different chemical potentials .",
    "each electrode is partitioned into two parts ( fig  [ system ] ) : the macroscopically large lead ( environment ) and the finite buffer zone between the system and the environment .",
    "so the hamiltonian of the whole system is @xmath2 we assume that the environment and the buffer zones are described by the noninteracting hamiltonians @xmath3 here @xmath4 denote the continuum single - particle spectra of the left ( @xmath5 ) and right ( @xmath6 ) lead states , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) create ( annihilate ) electron in the lead state @xmath9 .",
    "the buffer zones have discrete energy spectrum @xmath10 with corresponding creation and annihilation operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the system hamiltonian is taken in the most general form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) create ( annihilate ) electron in the single - particle state @xmath16 in the dot and @xmath17 contains two - particle electron - electron correlations , and/or electron - vibration coupling . the buffer - environment and quantum dot - buffer couplings",
    "have the standard tunneling form : @xmath18 @xmath19        now we introduce an embedded system which consist of the quantum system itself and the buffer zones .",
    "we have recently demonstrated that if we take the buffer zones sufficiently large the density matrix of the embedded system obeys the kinetic equation of lindblad type .",
    "the technical details of the derivations and underlying approximations can be found in appendix of  @xcite .",
    "here we give only the sketch of the derivation with the emphasis on important physics relevant to our subsequent discussion .",
    "the starting point is the liouville equation for the total density matrix @xmath20 in the interaction picture @xmath21.\\ ] ] here the buffer - environment coupling @xmath22 is treated as an interaction hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . to derive the lindblad master for the reduced density matrix of the embedded system , @xmath25 , we take the trace over the environment in eq .   and make the following approximations :    1 .",
    "the total density matrix can be factorized as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is density matrix of the environment taken in the equilibrium grand canonical ensemble form ( born approximation ) ; 2 .",
    "the environment relaxation time is very fast , so we can use local - time ( markov ) approximation for the reduced density matrix ; 3 .   the single particle states in the buffer zone propagate as free states @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of discrete single particle levels of the buffer zone ; 4 .   rapidly oscillating terms proportional to @xmath30 $ ] for @xmath31 are neglected ( rotating wave approximation ) .    under these approximations ,",
    "the liouville equation   reduces to a master equation for the reduced density matrix in lindblad form . in the schrdinger representation",
    "it can be written as @xmath32 + { \\pi}\\rho(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the hamiltonian @xmath33 includes the lamb shift of the single - particle levels of the buffer zones @xmath34 and the non - hermitian dissipator is given by the standard lindblad form @xmath35 the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 are referred to as the lindblad operators , which represent the buffer - environment interaction .",
    "they have the following form : @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41^{-1}$ ] and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the imaginary ( real ) part of the environment self energy @xmath44 .",
    "the lindblad master equation describes the time evolution of the open embedded quantum system preserving the probability and the positivity of the density matrix .",
    "open boundary conditions are taken into account by the non - hermitian dissipative part of eq . , @xmath45 , which represents the influence of environment on the buffer zone .",
    "the applied bias potential enters into eq . via fermionic occupation numbers @xmath46 which depend on the temperature ( @xmath47 ) and the chemical potential @xmath48 in the left and right electrodes .",
    "let us convert the lindblad master equation   to a non - hermitian field theory suitable for perturbative many - body calculations . to this aim",
    "we need to introduce the concept of creation and annihilation superoperators acting on the liouville - fock space  @xcite .",
    "our introduction of the liouville - fock space closely follows schmutz work  @xcite .",
    "it is general and not restricted to the particular choice of the kinetic equation .",
    "let @xmath49 be a complete orthonormal basis set in the fock space @xmath50 @xmath51 it is formed by particle number eigenstates @xmath52 , such that @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the vacuum state and @xmath55 , @xmath56 are creation and annihilation operators for single - particle state @xmath57 . without loss of generality",
    "we focus on fermions , so we assume that @xmath55 and @xmath56 satisfy the canonical anti - commutation relations .",
    "the set of linear operators @xmath58 acting on @xmath59 form a linear vector space , which is called the liouville - fock space associated with @xmath59 .",
    "we denote an element of the liouville - fock space by @xmath60 .",
    "the scalar product of two elements of the liouville - fock space is defined as @xmath61 in the liouville - fock space we introduce a complete orthonormal basis @xmath62 , which satisfies @xmath63 here @xmath64^\\dag}|\\,}}={\\ensuremath{\\langle{|n)(m|}|\\,}}$ ] , and @xmath65 is the identity operator in the liouville - fock space .",
    "then , for an arbitrary element of the liouville - fock space we have @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , the identity operator @xmath68 in eq .   corresponds to @xmath69 the scalar product of a vector @xmath60 with @xmath70 is equivalent to the trace operation in the fock space , @xmath71 and for the density matrix we have @xmath72 .",
    "as was suggested by schmutz  @xcite we introduce superoperators @xmath73 , @xmath74 through their action on the basis vectors @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 . by analyzing the hermitian conjugate of the matrix elements of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , we find @xmath78 it follows from   and   that superoperators @xmath73 , @xmath79 simulate the action of @xmath80 and @xmath81 on @xmath82 from the left , while @xmath74 , @xmath83 simulate the action of @xmath81 and @xmath84 on @xmath82 from the right . here",
    "we would like to emphasize that our definition of tilde superoperators @xmath74 , @xmath83 differs from schmutz s definition by phase factors @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the reason for introducing these factors is that the so - called tilde - substitution rule ( see bellow ) becomes simpler .",
    "we also note that the alternative definition for superoperators is used in  @xcite , where the `` right '' creation and annihilation superoperators are not hermitian conjugate to each other .",
    "as follows from and , the superoperators @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 obey the fermionic anti - commutation relations : @xmath91 while other anti - commutators vanish @xmath92 it also follows from and that @xmath93 and the liouville - fock space basis vectors are generated from the vacuum @xmath94 by application of the creation superoperators @xmath95 moreover , basis vectors @xmath75 are `` superfermion '' number eigenstates @xmath96    using the definition of superoperators we can rewrite the identity   in the following form @xmath97 note , that because of the different definition of tilde superoperators , the obtained expression for @xmath98 differs from schmutz s analogous expression  @xcite by the phase factor @xmath99 in the exponent . from  ( [ an_sup],[cr_sup ] ) and",
    "we find that the superoperators @xmath89 and @xmath87 are connected to their tilde conjugate @xmath90 and @xmath88 by the relations @xmath100    for an operator @xmath101 given by the power series of creation and annihilation operators we define two superoperators @xmath102 here , the @xmath103 means the complex conjugate of the @xmath104-number coefficients .",
    "the relation between non - tilde and tilde superoperators is given by the following tilde conjugation rules @xmath105 applying tilde conjugation to @xmath75 we find @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "therefore @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath98 is tilde - invariant .",
    "generally , if @xmath101 is a hermitian bosonic operator then @xmath109 .    according to the definition of the superoperator @xmath110 ,",
    "if @xmath111 then @xmath112 and we obtain @xmath113 @xmath114 therefore , the expectation value of an operator @xmath101 in the state with the density matrix @xmath115 can be calculated as the matrix element of the corresponding superoperator @xmath116 sandwiched between @xmath70 and @xmath117 @xmath118 using   we can show that the following tilde - substitution rule is valid @xmath119 here @xmath120 if @xmath121 is a bosonic operator and @xmath122 if @xmath121 is a fermionic operator .",
    "moreover , taking into account that non - tilde and tilde fermion superoperators anti - commute we find that @xmath123 if both @xmath124 and @xmath125 are fermionic operators , and @xmath126 otherwise .",
    "it should be noted that schmutz tilde - substitution rule  @xcite is cumbersome and it takes the simple form like   only if all terms in the power series of @xmath127 have the common quantity @xmath128 . here",
    "@xmath129 is the number of creation ( annihilation ) operators .",
    "the general prescription to obtain equation for @xmath130 from the kinetic equation for @xmath131 is the following .",
    "first , we transform the kinetic equation for @xmath115 into the kinetic equation for @xmath132 by formally replacing all operators @xmath133 by superoperators @xmath134 .",
    "then , we multiply the kinetic equation from the right on vector @xmath98 and use  - to convert the kinetic equation to the schredinger - like equation for the vector @xmath135 : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the liouvillian which depends on both non - tilde and tilde superoperators . particularly , the liouvillian for the lindblad master equation   becomes @xmath138 where @xmath139 in derivation of   and   we took into account that @xmath132 is a bosonic superoperator which commutes with all tilde superoperators . due to the lindblad dissipators , the liouville superoperator   is non - hermitian .",
    "in addition , as @xmath140 is tilde - invariant , the liouvillian obeys the property @xmath141 .    taking the time derivative of @xmath142",
    "we find that @xmath143 , i.e. , @xmath144 the left zero - eigenvalue eigenstate of the liouvillian superoperator . since also @xmath70 is the vacuum for @xmath145 and @xmath146 superoperators , it is appropriate to call @xmath70 left vacuum vector .",
    "for the electron transport problem we focus on nonequilibrium steady - state where the current through the quantum dot is given by @xmath147 here @xmath148 is the current superoperator , and the stationary , steady - state solution of  , @xmath149 , is the right zero - eigenvalue eigenstate ( right vacuum vector ) of the liouville superoperator @xmath150 in the next section , we show how one can find @xmath149 perturbatively starting from the free - field approximation for nonequilibrium density matrix .",
    "let us make the important remark on the notation use in the rest of the paper : only creation / annihilation operators written with letters @xmath151 ( such as for example @xmath12 and @xmath152 ) are related to each other by the hermitian conjugation ; all other creation @xmath153 and annihilation @xmath154 operators are `` canonically conjugated '' to each other , i.e. , for example , @xmath155 does not mean @xmath156 although @xmath157 ( @xmath158 - bosons / fermions ) .",
    "we will also use the same notation for the non - tilde superoperators @xmath89 and @xmath87 as the ordinary operators @xmath159 and @xmath56 bearing in mind that all operators acting in the liouville - fock space are are superoperators .",
    "we start by rewriting the liouvillian   as @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the quadratic unperturbed part of @xmath137 , and @xmath162 is a perturbation . then using the equation of motion method @xmath163&=-\\omega_n c^\\dag_n , \\notag\\\\ [ c_n , l^{(0)}]&=\\omega_n c_n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we exactly diagonalize@xcite @xmath161 in terms of nonequilibrium quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators : @xmath164 here @xmath165 are obtained from @xmath166 by the tilde conjugation rules .",
    "the nonequilibrium quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators are connected to @xmath167 by canonical ( but not unitary ) transformations : @xmath168 where @xmath169 nonequilibrium quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators obey the fermionic anti - commutation relations . in particular , from @xmath170 and @xmath171 we find the following orthonormality conditions for amplitudes @xmath172    by construction , @xmath173 is the left vacuum for @xmath174 operators .",
    "the vacuum for @xmath175 operators , @xmath176 , is automatically the zero - eigenvalue eigenstate of the unperturbed liouvillian @xmath161 , i.e. , it is the steady state density matrix in the zeroth - order approximation : @xmath177 in other words , the the zeroth - order density matrix is the density matrix which does not contain nonequilibrium quasiparticle excitations .",
    "now we introduce the continuous real parameter @xmath178 , which will be set to unity in the end of the calculations , @xmath179 and expand the exact steady state density matrix in powers of @xmath178 , @xmath180 substituting ( [ ss_expansion ] ) into eq .  , we obtain equation for the @xmath181th - order correction to the zeroth - order density matrix : @xmath182 or @xmath183 . here , @xmath184 is expressed in terms of the nonequilibrium quasiparticles .",
    "thus , starting from @xmath185 we can find any @xmath181th - order corrections to it .",
    "in addition , @xmath186 for @xmath187 since @xmath188 contains excited nonequilibrium quasiparticles .    to calculate the current through the quantum dot we express the current superoperator @xmath189 in terms of nonequilibrium quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators and compute its expectation value with respect to @xmath70 and @xmath149 . as a result",

    "thus , the problem of computing the @xmath181th - order correction to the unperturbed current is reduced to finding @xmath195 by solving eq .  .",
    "using the same method we can obtain perturbative expansion for the population of a quantum dot single - particle level @xmath199 where @xmath200 the anti - commutation condition @xmath201 imposes the constraint on the amplitudes from which follows that @xmath202 is a real number .      as the first application of the method we consider the hamiltonian @xmath203 which describes one electronic single - particle level coupled linearly to a vibration mode ( phonon ) of frequency @xmath204 ( so - called local holstein model ) @xmath205 for simplicity",
    "we assume that the tunneling matrix element in eq .   is real number @xmath206 independent of indices @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "the electron spin does not play any role here , so we suppress the spin index in the equations in this section . replacing @xmath209 by @xmath210",

    "the retarded green s function is the solution of the dyson equation @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the noninteracting retarded green s function and @xmath293 is retarded self - energy evaluated in the presence of electron - electron or electron - vibration interaction . expanding @xmath293 with respect to electron - electron or electron - vibration coupling , @xmath294 , we obtain perturbative expansion of @xmath284 and consequently of the current @xmath295 \\gamma(\\omega ) \\notag\\\\ & \\times\\mathrm{im}[g^r_0(\\omega ) +   \\sum_{p=1 } \\lambda^pg^r_p(\\omega ) ] = \\sum_{p=0 } \\lambda^p j^{(p)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath296 is the current through the system without interaction given by the standard landauer formula .    in  @xcite we have shown that for the current through a system without interaction , @xmath296 , the exact agreement between negf and kinetic equation approach can be achieved by increasing the density of states in the buffer zones .",
    "below we show that this is also true for correlated electronic systems .",
    "in what follows , in the calculations based on the kinetic equation we will assume that @xmath29 single - particle levels in each buffer zone are evenly distributed within the energy bandwidth @xmath297=[-10,10]$ ] .",
    "this bandwidth is much larger than any energy parameter in the system , so it corresponds to the wide - band approximation used in negf calculations .",
    "the tunneling coupling strength @xmath206 is computed from @xmath298 , where @xmath299 is density of states in the buffer zone .",
    "we note here that the main approximation in the derivation of the lindblad master equation   is that the single particle states in the buffer zone propagate in time as free states ( [ sqrtn ] ) .",
    "it is evident from eq.([sqrtn ] ) that the larger the buffer zone , i.e. the larger the density of states @xmath300 , the better this approximation",
    ". this will be also explicitly demonstrated in the numerical calculations below .",
    "the parameter @xmath301 in the lindblad operators is chosen to be @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is the energy spacing between the energy levels in the buffer zone .",
    "in addition , although it is not necessary , we use a symmetric applied voltage , @xmath304 , and the temperature of the electrodes is zero , @xmath305 .            at the beginning",
    ", we consider the system with electron - vibronic interaction and compare the second - order correction to the current obtained in the section  [ evc ] with that calculated using negf formalism ( [ pe_negf ] ) .",
    "we use the following model parameters of the hamiltonian  : @xmath306 , @xmath307 .    in negf formalism",
    "the second - order correction to the current arises from the retarded self - energy @xmath308 which contains contributions from hartree and fock diagrams , @xmath309 .",
    "the hartree self - energy is  @xcite @xmath310 where @xmath257 is the electron level population in the zero - order approximation @xmath311 the expression for the fock self - energy is more complicated and can be found elsewhere ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in figs .",
    "[ hartree ] and [ fock ] we compare hartree and fock second - order corrections to the current obtained within our approach with different size @xmath29 of buffer zone and the exact ones .",
    "the corrections are shown as functions of the level energy , @xmath312 , for two values of the applied voltage @xmath313 and broadening @xmath314 .",
    "it is evident from the figures that the difference between exact and lindblad equation based results become negligible as we increase the leads density of states in the buffer zone .",
    "the reason is that increasing the number of single - particle state in the buffer zones we make the approximation ( iii ) , under which lindblad master equation  ( [ lindblad ] ) was derived , more justified .",
    "the deviation of the results obtained from the lindblad kinetic equation and negf becomes smaller at the larger applied voltage or @xmath314 .",
    "now we compare first - order corrections to the current for the anderson model .",
    "we put @xmath315 for the strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "within the negf formalism the first order correction is solely due to hartree diagram and it is @xmath316 where the population @xmath257 is given by  eq .  .",
    "the results of numerical calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ first_order_hartree ] for different values of  @xmath314 and applied voltage  @xmath313 . as we can see",
    "the results of the lindblad equation approach converge to the exact results with increasing value of  @xmath29 and the convergence is faster for larger values of applied voltage and @xmath314 .    in fig .",
    "[ total ] we show the current through the anderson model computed by means of lindblad equation by taking into account the first- and second - order corrections .",
    "we take @xmath317 , so the obtained results correspond to negf ones .",
    "as we can see from the figure , the first- and second - order contributions shift the maximum of the current towards the symmetric point @xmath318 .",
    "the first - order correction increase the maximum current , while the second - order correction acts in opposite direction .",
    "we also see from fig .",
    "[ total ] that for a given @xmath319 the relative value of the first- and second - order corrections show little dependence on the applied voltage  @xmath313 . in contrast , in  @xcite we have observed that nonequilibrium post - hartree - fock electronic correlations play important role at larger applied voltages and , as a result , the second - order correction to the current become more pronounced with increasing @xmath313 .",
    "this is due to the difference in the structure and spectrum of nonequilibrium quasiparticles .",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum , both @xmath220 and @xmath221 amplitudes depend on the voltage in the post - hartree - fock perturbation theory  @xcite , whereas in the present work the voltage enters only into @xmath221 amplitudes of the nonequilibrium quasiparticles through fermi - dirac occupation numbers of the buffer states .",
