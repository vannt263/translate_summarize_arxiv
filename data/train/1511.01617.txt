    "the structural and magnetic properties of core - shell nps are essentially determined by a ratio of metal core and oxide shell which is highly dependent on cluster size .",
    "the nps size can be varied by adjusting several parameters such as the ratio of argon ( ar ) to helium ( he ) gas , the power supplied to magnetron sputtering , the aggregation length and the temperature of the aggregation region .",
    "the deferent studied np sizes were achieved by changing the ar to he gas ratio and keeping the other parameters such as power , aggregation length and temperature constant .",
    "energetic metal atoms were sputtered from the target cooled by water using the mixture of gases ( ar and he ) leading to the nucleation of clusters .",
    "the pressure difference allowed the clusters to travel from the aggregation chamber to the deposition chamber .",
    "the nucleation and growth of clusters ceases after expansion through a nozzle . a small amount of oxygen ( 2 sccm ) in the deposition chamber reacts with zero - valent crystal iron nps and forms a protective shell of oxide on nps before it lands softly onto the surface of silicon si ( 100 ) substrate at room temperature .",

    "<S> we have developed a model for the interacting ore / shell nanoparticles , which we used to analyze the dependence of the coercive field @xmath0 , the remanent saturation magnetization @xmath1 and the saturation magnetization @xmath2 on the interfacial exchange interaction between the core and the shell , the size of the nanoparticles and their interaction for fe / fe@xmath3o@xmath4 nanoparticles have been carried out . it has been shown that the hysteresis characteristics increase together with the size of nanoparticles . @xmath0 and @xmath1 are changing nonmonotonic when the constant interfacial exchange interaction changes from negative to positive values . in the system of core / shell nanoparticles , magnetic interaction results in @xmath0 and @xmath1 dropping , which was confirmed by experiments .    </S>",
