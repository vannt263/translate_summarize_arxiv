    "the swift satellite @xcite promises the build - up of a significant sample of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with well - understood selection criteria useful for cosmological studies of high - redshift galaxies @xcite and the hubble diagram @xcite .",
    "the best way of securing grb redshifts is from absorption line studies of the afterglow .",
    "however , for the first 56 swift grbs only 11 redshifts have been obtained .",
    "alternatively , redshifts can be obtained from host galaxy spectroscopy although this requires that the host is sufficiently bright and has detectable emission lines .    in this letter",
    "we explore a third approach suitable for fainter host galaxies in case a spectroscopic absorption or emission line redshift has not been obtained . for a sample of 10 grb host galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath3 and photometric measurements in more than 4 bands , @xcite found that photometric redshifts were consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts in all cases , within @xmath4 .",
    "an advantage of the method is that it is independent of whether the host galaxy has emission lines .    as the next step in validating the photometric redshift approach",
    "we here predict a redshift from a host galaxy with multiband photometry which is sufficiently bright that a spectroscopic redshift can be measured , and thereby test the photometric redshift .",
    "our target is which is currently one of the brightest hosts without a spectroscopic redshift .",
    "grb 981226 was detected by the bepposax satellite on 1998 december 26.41 ut .",
    "it is consistent with being an x - ray flash ( xrf ) with the fluences satisfying @xmath5 @xcite . despite intense optical and near - infrared ( ir )",
    "follow - up observations initiated 6.5 and 8.4 hours after the burst , respectively @xcite no optical counterpart was found @xcite .",
    "the deep @xmath6-band observations carried out by @xcite showed @xmath7 mag at 9.9 hours after the grb .",
    "this makes grb 981226 a typical grb without any detected afterglow @xcite and close to being a dark burst @xcite .",

    "identification of the host galaxy was suggested based on the small angular separation between the radio afterglow and an extended object .",
    "high spatial resolution images from the hst / stis show that the galaxy colours change notably over its surface , with the northern part being significantly bluer @xcite .",
    "the position of the radio afterglow with respect to the galaxy is 0749@xmath10328 @xcite , which encompasses the blue northern part of the host .",
