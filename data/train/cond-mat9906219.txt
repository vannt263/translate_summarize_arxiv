    "for a long time , systems with long - range interactions have posed a great challenge to the application of monte carlo  ( mc ) methods . due to the large number of interactions that have to be taken into account ,",
    "simulations are very time consuming and hence restricted to relatively small system sizes .",
    "alternatively , the interaction is truncated beyond a certain distance , which may introduce severe errors in the calculation .",
    "thus , it is desirable to have an algorithm at one s disposal that allows the efficient simulation of systems with long - range interactions without making any approximation except for the inherent statistical errors .",
    "a few years ago , an algorithm fulfilling these requirements was indeed introduced for the simulation of spin models  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the cluster method introduced by swendsen and wang  @xcite and has the crucial property that the number of operations required to add a single spin to a cluster is _ independent _ of the number of interactions of this spin with other spins in the system .",
    "thus , the numerical effort to simulate ferromagnetic long - range models becomes comparable to that for short - range models .",
    "close to the critical point the application of the algorithm becomes particularly profitable , since there one also benefits from the inherent reduction in critical slowing down in cluster algorithms .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to discuss this algorithm in some more detail and to illustrate its power by means of some selected applications .",
    "to set the stage , we first briefly discuss the standard cluster algorithm for a system with short - range interactions .",
    "for simplicity , we will employ a formulation in terms of the wolff cluster algorithm  @xcite rather than that of swendsen and wang  ( sw ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the modifications required for the simulation of long - range interactions pertain to the cluster - formation process only , and hence can equally well be combined with the sw variant . since a detailed derivation of the wolff algorithm can be found in numerous references , we restrict ourselves here to a schematic outline . consider a @xmath0-dimensional lattice structure , where on each lattice site  @xmath1 a spin  @xmath2 is placed , which can take the values  @xmath3 and which has a ferromagnetic coupling  @xmath4 with its nearest neighbors .",
    "thus , the system is described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath5 where the sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbors . at each monte carlo step , a cluster of spins with identical sign is flipped .",
    "the nonlocal character of this operation leads to a rapid decay of correlations .",
    "the crucial step is the identification of a cluster :    1 .   randomly choose a spin  @xmath2 from the lattice .",
    "2 .   consider each spin that interacts with spin  @xmath2 .",
    "it is added to the cluster with a probability @xmath6 , provided that it has the same sign as @xmath2 .",
    "3 .   repeat step  2 in turn for each spin that is newly added to the cluster , where one now considers all spins that interact with this spin , rather than with  @xmath2 .",
    "this is iterated until all neighbors of all spins in the cluster have been considered for inclusion .",
    "this cluster - building process is based on the kasteleyn ",
    "fortuin mapping  @xcite of the potts model on a bond - percolation model .",
    "this mapping allows a generalization of the outlined procedure to systems with different interaction strengths  @xmath7 .",
    "in the second step , a spin is simply added with a probability @xmath8 if the interaction strength with the spin  @xmath2 is equal to  @xmath7 . as a side note",
    ", it is remarked that this implies that a cluster now not necessarily can be visualized as a contiguous collection of spins .",
    "although one can thus easily devise a cluster algorithm for systems with long - range interactions , its efficiency rapidly decreases with an increasing number of interactions .",
    "indeed , the typical value for the coupling  @xmath4 in such a system will be relatively small and hence each single spin that is considered for inclusion in the cluster will be added only with a small probability .",
    "so , a lot of operations are required to add a single spin to the cluster .",
    "in order to illustrate our approach , we take the example of a one - dimensional chain with a spin  spin interaction that decays as a power - law , @xmath9 .",
    "the cluster - building process starts with a spin on a randomly chosen site  @xmath1 and all other spins in the system are added to the cluster with a probability @xmath10 , where @xmath11 $ ] . for each spin that is actually added to the cluster , its address is also placed on the _",
    "stack_. when all spins interacting with the first one have been considered , we read a new spin from the stack and repeat the process , until the stack is empty .",
    "the spin from which we are currently adding spins will be called the _ current spin_. in order to avoid considering each single spin for inclusion in the cluster , we split up the probability  @xmath12 into two parts , namely the kronecker delta testing whether the spins @xmath2 and @xmath13 have the same sign and the `` provisional '' probability  @xmath14 .",
    "this enables us to define the concept of the _ cumulative probability _",
    "@xmath15 , from which we can read off which spin is the next one to be provisionally added to the cluster , @xmath16 with @xmath17 p_n \\;.\\ ] ] @xmath18 is an abbreviation for @xmath19 ( and @xmath20 ) , i.e. , we define the origin at the position of the current spin .",
    "@xmath21 is the probability that in the first step @xmath22 spins are skipped and the @xmath23th spin is provisionally added . now",
    "the next spin  @xmath24 that is provisionally added is determined by a ( pseudo)random number @xmath25 : @xmath26 spins are skipped if @xmath27 .",
    "if the @xmath24th spin has indeed the same sign as the current spin then @xmath13 is added to the cluster .",
    "subsequently we skip again a number of spins before another spin at a distance @xmath28 is provisionally added . due to the requirement @xmath28 we must shift the function  @xmath29 , @xmath30 p_k \\;,\\ ] ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : firstbond ] ) is simply a special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : shiftfirstbond ] ) .",
    "the appropriate cumulative probability is now given by a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumprob ] ) , @xmath31 by using the specific form of the probability  @xmath14 one finds that this reduces to @xmath32 i.e. , the probability that the next spin that will be added lies at a distance in the range @xmath33 $ ] is given by an expression that has the same form as the original probability , in which the coupling constant is replaced by the sum of all the couplings with the spins in this range .",
    "we now consider two possibilities of calculating the distance  @xmath34 from a given @xmath35 .",
    "a straightforward approach is the construction of a look - up table .",
    "this means that we explicitly carry out the sum in  ( [ eq : gcumprob ] ) for a large number of distances @xmath34 , up to a certain cutoff  @xmath36 , and store the results in a table . then , after drawing a random number , we can derive the corresponding spin distance from this table . in principle",
    "we need for each value of  @xmath24 another look - up table containing the @xmath35 .",
    "this is hardly feasible and fortunately not necessary , as follows from a comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cumprob ] ) and  ( [ eq : gen - cumprob ] ) .",
    "namely ( assume @xmath28 ) , @xmath37 c_j(k )                     \\nonumber \\\\                 & = & c(j ) + \\left [ 1 - c(j ) \\right ] c_j(k)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath38/[1-c(j)]$ ] .",
    "so we can calculate @xmath35 directly from  @xmath39 .",
    "in practice one realizes this by using the distance  @xmath24 of the previous spin that was provisionally added to rescale the ( new ) random number @xmath40 to @xmath41 ; @xmath42g$ ] .",
    "since we only consider ferromagnetic interactions , @xmath43 exists and is smaller than 1 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : gcumprob ] ) .",
    "this method is very fast , since we have to calculate all cumulative probabilities only once , but it has two major drawbacks .",
    "first , we can accommodate only a limited number of spin distances in our look - up table and must therefore devise some approximation scheme to handle the tail of the long - range interaction , which is essential for the critical behavior in the case of slowly decaying interactions ( small  @xmath44 ) .",
    "this issue is addressed below . secondly , this method is impractical in more than one dimension , as the number of distances for which the cumulative probability has to be calculated rapidly increases with the dimensionality of the system ( for a fixed cutoff ) .    for interactions that can be explicitly summed",
    "there exists a powerful alternative . in those cases , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gcumprob ] ) can be solved for  @xmath34 , yielding an expression for the spin distance in terms of @xmath35 , i.e. , in terms of the random number  @xmath40 . especially for the study of critical phenomena",
    "this is often a feasible approach , since in many cases one can modify an interaction such it can be explicitly integrated by only adding irrelevant terms that do not affect the universal critical properties . as an example , we consider again the power - law interaction @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding sum appearing in the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : gcumprob ] ) is ( for @xmath46 ) the truncated riemann zeta function , which can not be expressed in closed form .",
    "however , upon approximation of this sum by the integral @xmath47 one still has an exact monte carlo scheme , but for an interaction @xmath48 both interactions belong to the same universality class , so that , e.g. , for the determination of critical exponents one is free to make the most convenient choice .",
    "of course , all nonuniversal quantities , such as the critical temperature , will have different values . for the modified interaction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gcumprob ] ) reduces to @xmath49 \\ ; , \\label{eq : contcumprob}\\ ] ] where it should be noted that this is only the probability for adding a spin that lies in a single direction .",
    "we have not written @xmath50 and @xmath51 instead of @xmath24 and  @xmath34 , because we prefer to use continuous coordinates , which only in the last stage are rounded to a lattice site .",
    "equating @xmath35 to the random number @xmath40 we find @xmath52 ^{-1/\\sigma } \\;. \\label{eq : bonddistance}\\ ] ] rescaling of the random number is no longer required : the lowest value , @xmath53 , leads to a provisionally added spin at the same distance as the previous one , @xmath54 . if @xmath55 $ ] the next provisionally added spin lies at infinity and thus @xmath56 yields no spin at all .",
    "once the coordinates of the next provisionally added spin have been calculated by rounding to the nearest integer coordinate , the periodic boundary conditions are applied to map this coordinate onto a lattice site . for the following",
    "provisionally added spin , @xmath24 is set equal to @xmath34 ( _ not _ to the rounded distance ! ) and a new @xmath34 is determined .",
    "if no spin has been added yet , @xmath24 is set to @xmath57 , the lowest possible distance .",
    "for higher dimensionalities , @xmath58 additional random numbers are required to determine the direction in which the next spin is added .",
    "the above - mentioned limited size  @xmath36 of the look - up table can now be coped with as well : beyond the spin distance @xmath36 the sum in  ( [ eq : gcumprob ] ) is approximated by an integral .",
    "thus , if the random number  @xmath40 lies in the interval @xmath59 , the spin distance @xmath34 is determined from a modified version of  ( [ eq : bonddistance ] ) , where the lower part of the integral is replaced by an explicit sum @xmath60^{-1/\\sigma } \\;. \\label{eq : bonddist-1d}\\ ] ]      finally , we briefly illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm by means of an example .",
    "if the probability @xmath61 were equal for each spin pair , one out of @xmath62 spins would be added to the cluster , and it would take @xmath63 operations per spin to update a configuration , compared to @xmath64 operations _ per spin _ for a metropolis algorithm . taking into account the decrease in critical slowing down , we see that the efficiency of this method is typically a factor @xmath65 larger than the conventional monte carlo algorithm . in the case of a large but finite interaction range  @xmath66 , such as for the two - dimensional equivalent - neighbor model discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ising2d ] , one gains a factor  @xmath67 , provided that critical slowing down is completely suppressed in the cluster algorithm . far from the critical temperature ,",
    "the factor @xmath68 disappears , but one still has the advantage of a speed increase proportional to the number of interactions per spin .",
    "as a first application , we consider the ising chain introduced before , with spin  spin interactions that decay as @xmath69 . unlike the ising chain with short - range interactions , in which no long - range order is possible for nonzero temperatures , this system exhibits a remarkably rich behavior .",
    "the interested reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . in summary ,",
    "the system exhibits mean - field - like critical behavior for @xmath70 and nonclassical critical behavior for @xmath71 , with critical exponents that depend on  @xmath44 . for @xmath72",
    "the interactions are essentially short - ranged . at @xmath73 , the so - called inverse - square ising model",
    ", we have a very interesting situation : the spin chain displays a phase transition which is the one - dimensional analog of the kosterlitz ",
    "thouless  ( kt ) transition in the two - dimensional @xmath74  model .",
    "it has close connections to a variety of physical applications , such as the kondo problem , quantum tunneling in a two - state system coupled to a dissipative environment , quark confinement , etc .",
    "although the kt transition has received an enormous amount of attention over the past decades , there are still open questions .",
    "two peculiar properties of this transition are : ( 1 )  at the critical temperature  @xmath75 the order parameter exhibits a singular behavior _ superposed _ on a jump like one finds for a first - order transition ; ( 2 )  the correlation length  @xmath76 and the susceptibility  @xmath77 diverge exponentially for @xmath78 : @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath80 $ ] , with @xmath81 .",
    "these and related critical properties turn out to be very difficult to verify in numerical simulations of two - dimensional models , because the finite - size effects decay only logarithmically .",
    "the one - dimensional model , which now can be simulated with comparable efficiency , clearly offers a great advantage : rather than a linear system size of @xmath82 , like for @xmath83 , one can reach system sizes @xmath84 and thus approach the critical point much closer . since a detailed description of the critical properties and their numerical determination is beyond the scope of this paper , we restrict ourselves here to a study of the quantity @xmath85 , where @xmath4 is the coupling constant and @xmath86 the magnetization density , and its application for the determination of  @xmath75 ( or , equivalently , its inverse , the critical coupling  @xmath87 ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath88 is the analog of the spin - wave stiffness in the 2d  @xmath74 model . just like the latter quantity is predicted to have a universal jump  @xmath89 at criticality , @xmath88 is expected to have a jump of size  @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in figure  [ fig : psi ] , where @xmath90 is shown for system sizes up to @xmath91 , one can already clearly observe how such a jump develops with increasing system size .",
    "the superposed square - root singularity , @xmath92 is shown in the inset .     as a function of the coupling  @xmath4 , for system sizes @xmath93 .",
    "the inset shows @xmath94 for @xmath95 . ]",
    "we consider now three distinct ways to use this quantity for the determination of  @xmath87 , which for phase transitions in this universality class is notoriously difficult .",
    "first , one may use the predicted singular behavior of @xmath88 for @xmath96 . to this end",

    "secondly , @xmath90 in the high - temperature regime @xmath102 may be used to estimate  @xmath87 .",
    "indeed , within the finite - size regime one expects two types of corrections to scaling : corrections due to irrelevant fields , which decay as powers of @xmath103 , and temperature - dependent corrections which can be expanded in terms of @xmath104 .",
    "a least - squares fit of the numerical data to an expansion of the form @xmath105 has yielded @xmath106 and @xmath107 . fixing @xmath108 at the predicted value  @xmath57 we found @xmath109 . finally ,",

    "it is rewarding that the three different methods yield consistent estimates for the critical coupling .",

    "remarkably , most numerical results ( of which only few carry an explicit estimate of the uncertainty ) suggest a critical coupling around  @xmath113 . our estimate lies considerably higher and only agrees with the series - expansion result of ref .",
    "all methods that rely on an extension of mean - field theory clearly suffer from the extremely slow convergence to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the exact conjecture of ref .",
    "@xcite ( which is , interestingly , precisely twice as large as the mean - field result  @xmath114 ) has been refuted .      in order to illustrate that also for interactions with a large but strictly finite range the presented algorithm offers great advantages",
    ", we consider the so - called `` equivalent - neighbor '' model .",
    "this is a simple generalization of the ising model , in which each spin interacts equally strongly with all its neighbors within a distance  @xmath115 . in the limit",
    "@xmath116 this model becomes equivalent to the exactly - solved mean - field model , whereas all systems with a _",
    "finite _ interaction range belong to the ising universality class .",

    "another , experimentally very relevant , application of this model will be discussed here .",
    "as is well known , many thermodynamic properties show a characteristic power - law divergence upon approach of a critical point . these powers , or critical exponents , have universal values that only depend on a small number of _ global _ properties of the system under consideration .",
    "for example , binary mixtures , simple fluids , and uniaxial ferromagnets all exhibit the same set of critical exponents as the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "however , the corresponding power - law behavior is only observed asymptotically close to the critical point , whereas at temperatures farther away from  @xmath75 ( but still relatively close to it ) one may observe classical or mean - field - like critical behavior .",
    "crossover _ can be explained in terms of competing fixed points of a renormalization - group transformation and is in principle well understood .",
    "however , unlike the critical exponents , for which accurate results have been obtained from series expansions , renormalization - group calculations , experiments , and numerical calculations , the precise nature of the crossover from one universality class to another is still a point of discussion . in particular",
    ", it is an unsettled question to what extent this crossover is universal .",
    "there exist several field - theoretic calculations , but it has not yet been possible to verify their correctness by means of experiments .",
    "measurements in the critical region are not only difficult , one also has to take great care to make the temperature distance to the critical point not too large , since one then would leave the critical region .",
    "as stated by the ginzburg criterion , the crossover is a function of @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the reduced temperature and @xmath120 a system - dependent parameter . throughout the crossover region",
    ", @xmath121 has to be kept small , but @xmath118 has to be varied over several decades .",
    "the large extent of the crossover region also emphasizes its experimental relevance : many measurements of critical exponents are actually made within this region rather than asymptotically close to the critical point and hence a detailed knowledge of crossover functions is required for a proper interpretation of the data . since the ginzburg parameter  @xmath120 is a function of the interaction range , it is well possible to construct such crossover functions from data obtained by means of simulations of systems with different interaction ranges , where for each system @xmath121 is varied over a limited range only . in view of the large coordination numbers [ @xmath122 that have to be reached within this approach ,",

    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of this topic ) . in the 2d ising model ,",
    "the susceptibility  @xmath77 diverges for @xmath126 as @xmath127 and for @xmath128 as @xmath129 , where the amplitudes @xmath130 are known exactly .",

    "also the expectation that the crossover takes several decades in the parameter @xmath118 is confirmed .",
    "however , there is a striking difference between @xmath148 and  @xmath149 : whereas the latter exhibits a gradual decrease from @xmath135 to  @xmath136 when the distance to the critical point is increased , the former drops much more rapidly and even goes through a minimum where @xmath150 , before reaching its asymptotic value .",
    "interestingly , the occurrence of such a nonmonotonic variation has been inferred from rg calculations for three - dimensional systems .",

    "the fact that the curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : gamma - lt-2d ] and  [ fig : gamma - ht-2d ] overlap for different values of  @xmath66 suggests that the crossover functions possess a certain degree of universality .",

    "it has been suggested  @xcite that an additional length scale comes into play here . in order to investigate this possibility ,",
    "we have carried out simulations of two - dimensional models that are very similar to those studied above , except that the interaction profile has been modified  @xcite . instead of a constant interaction strength ( block - shaped profile ) ,",
    "a double - blocked potential was used , where each spin interacts with a strength  @xmath151 with its @xmath152 neighbors within a distance @xmath153 ( domain  @xmath154 ) and with a strength  @xmath155 with its @xmath156 neighbors within a distance @xmath157 ( domain  @xmath158 ) . in order to create a strong asymmetry ,",

    "also the order parameter must not necessarily be ising - like : the extension to general @xmath182 models  @xcite is similar to that for the original wolff algorithm and the first application to a potts model has already been published  @xcite .",
    "the generalization to a situation in which additional antiferromagnetic interactions are present is , in principle , also possible . whereas competing interactions will move the system away from the percolation threshold ( and thus critical slowing down",
    "will no longer be optimally suppressed ) , one still has the advantage that not every individual spin has to be considered for inclusion in the cluster .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to see whether this algorithm can be useful in other fields of physics where cluster algorithms have come to flourish .",
