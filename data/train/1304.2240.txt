    "an interesting and important development of string theory is the realization that coordinates determining the geometry may become noncommutative operators in a @xmath2-brane @xcite .",
    "this results in a fundamental discretization of spacetime due to the commutator @xmath3=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath4 is an antisymmetric matrix .",
    "there is an interesting similarity to the uncertainty principle in which the planck constant @xmath5 discretizes phase space @xcite . this noncommutative geometry is an intrinsic property of spacetime that does not depend on particular features such as curvature .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out in ref . @xcite that noncommutativity replaces pointlike structures by smeared objects , thereby eliminating the divergences that normally appear in general relativity .",
    "this smearing can be modeled by the use of the gaussian distribution of minimal length @xmath6 instead of the dirac delta function .",

    "the gaussian source has also been used by sushkov @xcite to model phantom - energy supported wormholes , as well as by nicolini and spalluci @xcite for the purpose of modeling the physical effects of short - distance fluctuations of noncommutative coordinates in the study of black holes .",

    "the necessary violation of the weak energy condition is attributable to the noncommutative - geometry background rather than to the use of exotic matter .",
    "he concluded that if string theory is correct , then the laws of physics allow macroscopic traversable wormholes with zero tidal forces that are stable to linearized radial perturbations .",

    "it is worth noting that wormholes with power - law @xmath14 gravity and a non - constant redshift function have been explored in the literature @xcite , but for simplicity and viability purposes , we shall restrict ourselves to the above assumption .",
