    "pnc is determined by a complex function @xmath8 via the one - form e^3 = du+ d + y d - y d v [ cong ] written in the null cartesian coordinates 2 ^ 12&= & x + i y , 2 ^ 12 = x - i y , + 2 ^ 12u & = & z + t , 2 ^ 12v = z - t .",
    "[ ncc ]    one of the most important solution of this class is the kerr - newman solution for the rotating and charged black hole .",
    "it has been mentioned long ago that the kerr - newman solution displays some relationships to the quantum world .",
    "it has the anomalous gyromagnetic ratio @xmath9 , as that of the dirac electron @xcite , stringy structures @xcite and other features allowing one to construct a semiclassical model of the extended electron @xcite which has the compton size and possesses the wave properties @xcite .",
    "so , we will be speaking on _ the kerr spinning particle _ , assuming a particle - like source of the einstein -maxwell field equations generating the external kerr - newman field and having a definite position of centrum of mass , and the definite momentum and orientation of angular momentum .",
    "principal null congruence ( pnc ) of the kerr - newman solution represents a vortex of the light - like rays ( see fig.1 ) which are _ twistors _ indeed .",
    "so , the kerr geometry is supplied by a _ twistorial structure _ which is described in twistor terms by the kerr theorem .",
    "in addition to the very important meaning for twistor theory @xcite , the kerr theorem represents in the kerr - schild approach @xcite _ a very useful technical instrument _ allowing one to obtain the kerr - newman solution and its generalizations .    in accordance with the kerr theorem ,",
    "the general geodesic and shear - free congruence on @xmath10 is generated by the simple algebraic equation f = 0 , [ kt]where @xmath11 is any holomorphic function of the projective twistor coordinates y , _1 = - y v , _2 = u + y .[tw ] since the twistor coordinates @xmath12 are itself the functions of @xmath13 , one can consider @xmath0 as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , so the solution of ( [ kt ] ) is a function @xmath8 which allows one to restore pnc by using the relation ( [ cong ] ) .",
    "we shall call the function @xmath0 as _ generating function of the kerr theorem . _",
    "it should be noted that the kerr theorem has never been published by r. kerr as a theorem .",
    "first , it has been published without a proof in the penrose work `` twistor algebra '' @xcite . however , in a restricted form it has practically been used in @xcite by derivation of the kerr - newman solution .",
    "the text of paper @xcite contains some technical details which allows one to reconstruct the proof of the kerr theorem in a general form which is valid for the kerr - schild class of metrics @xcite .",
    "we reproduce this proof in the appendix b.    the basic results of the fundamental work @xcite were obtained for the quadratic in @xmath13 generating function @xmath0 , which corresponds to the kerr pnc . in particular , for the kerr - newman solution the equation @xmath15 has two roots @xmath16",
    "@xcite , and the space - time is double sheeted , which is one of the mysteries of the kerr geometry , since the @xmath17 and @xmath18 sheets are imbedded in the same minkowski background having dissimilar gravitation ( and electromagnetic ) fields , and the fields living on the @xmath17-sheet do not feel the existence of different fields on the @xmath18-sheet .",
    "it has been mentioned in @xcite , that for quadratic in @xmath13 functions @xmath0 the kerr theorem determines not only congruence , but also allows one to determine the metric and electromagnetic field ( up to an arbitrary function @xmath19 ) .    in this paper",
    "we give the proof of an _ extended version of the kerr theorem _ which allows one to determine the corresponding geodesic and shear - free pnc for a very broad class of holomorphic generating functions @xmath0 , and also to reconstruct the metric and electromagnetic field , i.e. to describe fully corresponding class of the exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell field equations .",
    "in particular , we consider polynomial generating functions @xmath0 of higher degrees in @xmath13 which lead to the multiparticle kerr - schild solutions .",
    "these solutions have a new peculiarity : the space - time and corresponding twistorial structures turn out to be multi - sheeted .",
    "the wonderful twosheetedness of the usual kerr space - time is generalized in these solutions to multi - sheeted space - times which are determined by multi - sheeted riemann holomorphic surfaces and induce the corresponding multi - sheeted twistorial structures .",
    "twistorial structures of the i - th and j - th particles do not feel each other , forming a type of its internal space .",
    "however , the corresponding exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell field equations show that particles interact via the common singular twistor lines  the light - like pp - strings .",
    "the appearance of singular strings is typical for the known multiparticle solutions @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to the usual cases , these strings are light - like and do not have conical singularities .",
    "we find out that the mystery of the known two - sheetedness of the kerr geometry is generalized to some more mystical multi - sheetedness of the multiparticle solutions .",
    "we find out that besides the usual kerr - newman solution for an isolated spinning particle , there is a series of the exact solutions , in which the selected kerr - newman particle is surrounded by external particles and interacts with them by singular pp - strings .",
    "it is reminiscent of the known from quantum theory difference between the `` naked '' one - particle electron of the dirac theory and a multi - particle structure of a `` dressed '' electron which is surrounded by virtual photons in accordance with qed .",
    "the multiparticle space - time turns out to be penetrated by a multi - sheeted web of twistors .",
    "since they are not observable at the classical level , we conjecture that these multi - sheeted twistor congruences are related to a twistorial structure of vacuum and may be a substitute for the usual spin - foam of quantum gravity , in the spirit of the spin net - work proposals by penrose .",
    "taking also into account the other known relations of the kerr geometry to quantum theory , one can conjecture that multisheeted kerr geometry gives a hint for a new way to quantum gravity .",
    "basically , we use the notations of the fundamental paper by debney , kerr and schild @xcite , however , the the kerr - schild form of metric ( [ ksa ] ) is very convenient for derivation , but for applications an another equivalent form is more convenient    g _ = _",
    "+ 2h k_k_. [ ksnorm ] it is obtained by a simple replacement @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a function which normalizes the vector field @xmath22 , removing singularity by @xmath23 .",
    "function @xmath24 is also determined by the kerr theorem .    for the reader convenience we give in the appendix a a brief description of the basic relations of the kerr - schild formalism .",
    "in the appendix b we reproduce the derivation of the kerr theorem for the kerr - schild backgrounds , following to the papers @xcite . in the appendix c",
    "we describe briefly the results of @xcite , the basic kerr - schild equations for the general geodesic and shearfree congruences .",
    "appendix d is written for the mathematically oriented readers and contains a description of the double twistor bundle forming the geodesic and shearfree congruences on the minkowski and the kerr - schild space - times .",
    "the kerr - schild form of metric ( [ ksa ] ) has the remarkable properties allowing one to apply _ rigorously _ the kerr theorem to the curved spaces .",
    "it is related to the fact that the pnc field @xmath25 , being null and gsf with respect to the kerr - schild metric @xmath26 , @xmath27 will also be null and gsf with respect to the auxiliary minkowski metric , and this relation remains valid by an analytic extension to the complex region . in the appendix a we show that the geodesic and shear - free conditions on pnc coincide in the minkowski space and in the kerr - schild background .",
    "therefore , obtaining a geodesic and shear - free pnc in minkowski space in accordance with the kerr theorem , and using the corresponding null vector field @xmath28 in the kerr - schild form of metric , one obtains a curved kerr - schild space - time where pnc will also be null , geodesic and shearfree .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the quadratic in @xmath13 generating function of the kerr theorem can be expressed via a set of parameters @xmath29 which determine the position , motion and orientation of the kerr spinning particle .",
    "for some selected particle @xmath30 , function @xmath31 , may be represented in general form f_i(y|q_i)=a(x|q_i)y^2 + b(x|q_i)y + c(x|q_i ) [ fiabc ] .",
    "the equation @xmath32 can be resolved explicitly , leading to two roots @xmath33 which correspond to two sheets of the kerr space - time .",
    "the root @xmath34 determines via ( [ cong ] ) the out - going congruence on the @xmath17-sheet , while the root @xmath35 gives the in - going congruence on the @xmath18-sheet . by using these root solutions",

    "based on this ansatz , after rather long calculations and integration of the einstein - maxwell field equations _ performed in the work @xcite _ under the conditions that pnc is geodesic and shearfree ( which means @xmath37 and @xmath38 see appendix a ) , one can represent the function @xmath39 in the form h^(i)=12",

    "one should mention that it is a direct generalization of the well known two - sheetedness of the usual kerr space - time .",
    "since the twistorial structures of different particles are independent , it seems that the k - particle solutions @xmath65 form a trivial covering space @xmath66 over the sphere @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath66 is a trivial sum of k disconnected two - sheeted subspaces @xmath68 .",
