    "in the previous investigations the significant influence of the relevant ion - atom absorption processes on the solar photosphere opacity was already demonstrated .",
    "so , in @xcite and @xcite ) have been studied such symmetric ion - atom processes , as the molecular ion h@xmath3 photo - dissociation @xmath8 and the absorption charge exchange in ( h@xmath1 + h)-collisions @xmath9 where h = h(1s ) , h@xmath3 is the hydrogen molecular ion in the ground electronic state , and @xmath10 - the energy of a photon with the wavelength @xmath11 . the significance of these processes was established within the solar photosphere models from @xcite and @xcite in the optical , and from @xcite in far uv and euv regions of @xmath11 .",
    "later , the symmetric processes ( [ eq : sim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : sim2 ] ) were included _",
    "ab initio _ in one of the new solar photosphere models @xcite .",
    "then , in @xcite was undertaken the investigation of some non - symmetric ion - atom absorption processes , namely the photo - dissociation and photo - association of the the molecular ions @xmath12 @xmath13 and the absorption charge - exchange in the ion - atom collisions @xmath14 where @xmath5 is the ground state atom of one of metals , relevant for the used solar photosphere model , whose ionization potential @xmath15 is smaller than the hydrogen atom ionization potential @xmath16 , @xmath4 - the corresponding atomic ion in its ground state , h@xmath4 and ( @xmath17 - the molecular ion in the electronic states which are adiabatically correlated ( at the infinite internuclear distance ) with the states of the ion - atom systems h + @xmath4 and h@xmath1 + @xmath5 respectively .",
    "these processes were examined within the same solar photosphere model as in @xcite , i.e. the model c from @xcite , with @xmath5 = mg , si and al .",
    "also , in accordance with the composition of the solar atmosphere , the processes of the type ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) , but with atom he(1s@xmath18 ) and ion h@xmath1 instead h and @xmath4 , were included in the consideration .",
    "however , it was established that in the case of this atmosphere ( for the difference of some helium reach stellar atmospheres considered in @xcite ) such processes can be practically neglected .",
    "since the ion - atom systems with the mentioned @xmath5 are strongly non - symmetric , the examined processes generate the quasi - molecular absorption bands in the neighborhoods of @xmath11 which correspond to the energies @xmath19 . according to the values of @xmath20 with the mentioned x these absorption bands lie in the part of the far uv region .",
    "we should note here that the photo - dissociation of the molecular ion hsi@xmath1 was considered first time from the astrophysical aspect ( interstellar clouds and the atmospheres of red giant stars ) in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite was shown that , in the case of the quiet sun , ion - atom processes ( [ eq : sim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : sim2 ] ) and ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) together become seriously concurrent to some other relevant absorbtion processes in far uv and euv regions within the whole solar photosphere .",
    "this result is especially important , since among all possible ion - atom non - symmetric processes only those of them , for which the needed data about the corresponding molecular ions were known , were taken into account . because of that , it was natural to conclude that the non - symmetric processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) should be also included _ ab initio _ in the corresponding solar photosphere models .",
    "one can see that the previous investigations of the ion - atom absorption processes were performed only in the case of the quiet sun .",
    "however , it is well known how significant role for the solar atmosphere the sunspots play , and certainly it was interesting to see what is the situation with these processes in such objects . because of that , this investigation , whose some preliminary results were referred recently on a corresponding astrophysical conference @xcite , was undertaken .",
    "all considerations were within the sunspot model m from @xcite .",
    "such choice was caused by the fact that only this model , among other models mentioned in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , provided all data needed for the calculations of the absorption coefficients which characterize the considered absorption processes .",
    "certainly , the ion - atom absorption processes of the type ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) were included in the considerations .",
    "however , here we take into account also additional processes of the molecular ion photo - dissociation and photo - association @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ion in excited state with the excitation energy @xmath24 and h@xmath23 - the molecular ion in the electronic state adiabatically correlated with the state of the h + @xmath23 system , as well as the corresponding collisional excitation @xmath25 which realizes over creation of the quasimolecular complex ( h + @xmath26 in the excited electronic state adiabatically correlated with the state of the same system h + @xmath23 as in the process ( [ eq : sat3 ] ) .",
    "depending of the values of @xmath27 the absorption bands generated by the processes ( [ eq : sat1 ] ) - ( [ eq : sat2 ] ) can lie not only in far uv region of @xmath11 , but also in near uv and visible regions .",
    "the reason for the consideration of these processes is the fact that the absorption bands generated by some of them overlap with the bands generated by the processes ( [ eq : sim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : sim2 ] ) and ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) .",
    "if the radiative transition @xmath28 is allowed by the dipole selection rules the corresponding absorption band can be treated , as in the case of the similar phenomena caused by atom - atom collisions ( @xcite ) , i.e. as the satellite of the ion spectral line connected with the mentioned transition .",
    "the basic task of this investigation is to estimate the significance of the symmetric and non - symmetric ion - atom absorption processes in the case of the sunspot with respect to the processes of the negative hydrogen ion h@xmath29 photo - detachment and inverse `` bremsstrahlung '' in ( @xmath30 + h)-collisions , namely @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath30 and @xmath33 denote the free electron in initial and final channel , which , similarly to the previous papers , are treated here as the referent processes .",
    "it is connected with the concept of this paper which stays the same as in all previous papers .",
    "namely , the aim of these papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) was to pay attention on the considered ion - atom radiative processes as the factors of the influence on the opacity of the solar atmosphere .",
    "for that purpose it was needed ( and enough in the same time ) to show that the efficiency of these processes in the considered spectral region is close to the efficiency of some known radiative processes whose significance for the solar atmosphere is accepted in literature .",
    "it is clear that in the case of this atmosphere just the electron - atom processes ( [ eq : eat1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eat2 ] ) can be taken as the referent ones .",
    "because of that in these previous papers many other radiative processes have not been considered , including here the certainly very important processes of the metal atom photo - ionization , which were already discussed in the literature in connection with the quiet sun atmosphere in @xcite .",
    "we mean the processes @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the given metal atom in the ground state , i.e. @xmath5 , or in any possible ( under the considered conditions ) excited state , i.e. @xmath36 . however , within the sunspot we have a significantly smaller temperature than in the quiet sun photosphere ( see figure about model ) and consequently it is possible to expect there more larger efficiency of these photo - ionization processes , so that the position of the mentioned electron - atom processes as the referent ones is not so clear . because of that the processes of the metal atom photo - ionization were taken into account from the beginning of this investigation ( some of them were considered already in @xcite ) .         in accordance with above mentioned the following absorption processes are included in the consideration in this work : + - the symmetric ion - atom processes ( [ eq : sim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : sim2 ] ) ; + - the non - symmetric processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) with @xmath5 = na , ca , mg , si and al , for which the needed data about the corresponding molecular ions h@xmath4 are known ; + - the non - symmetric processes ( [ eq : sat1 ] ) - ( [ eq : sat2 ] ) with @xmath23 = ca@xmath37 , ca@xmath38 , ca@xmath39 , ca@xmath40 , ca@xmath41 and al@xmath42 , + - the electron - atom processes ( [ eq : eat1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eat2 ] ) ; + - the photo - ionization processes ( [ eq : phion ] ) with all metal atoms relevant for the used sunspots model , i.e. including the case @xmath5 = fe . + let us note that as in @xcite only such non - symmetric processes are taken into account here for which all needed data about the corresponding molecular ions are known from the literature .    it is well known that inside sunspot is needed to take into account the presence of its magnetic field . in connection with this we have to note that according to the existing data ( see e.g. @xcite ) this field is always not larger than 4000 gs . this is very important for us since it can be shown that in our further considerations the presence of such magnetic field can be completely neglected and all needed calculations can be performed as in the case of the quiet sun .         the aims of this work request determination of the corresponding spectral absorption coefficients for all mentioned ion - atom processes , as well as for the concurrent absorption processes ( [ eq : eat1 ] ) - ( [ eq : eat2 ] ) and ( [ eq : phion ] ) , as functions of @xmath11 and the height @xmath43 above the referent solar atmosphere layer .",
    "in this context the processes ( [ eq : sim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : sim2 ] ) , ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) and ( [ eq : sat1 ] ) - ( [ eq : sat2 ] ) are treated as the processes from the groups `` 1 '' , `` 2 '' and `` 3 '' respectively , which is denotes by the corresponding index : @xmath44 = 1 , 2 or 3 .",
    "let us note that here the spectral characteristics of the non - symmetric processes of the type ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) , but with @xmath5 = li , are also determined in rather wide regions of the temperatures and wavelengths .",

    "already this figure gives the possibility to expect that in the sunspot case these total efficiencies could be close at least in a part of the mentioned spectral region .",
    "it can be tested on the basis of the behavior of the quantity @xmath148 , defined by @xmath149 where @xmath95 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : kapaea ] .",
    "the behavior of this quantity ( also for several values of @xmath11 from the far uv region ) is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : f ] in the same interval of heights : -125 km @xmath150 200 km .",
    "this figure shows that : for any of the taken @xmath11 the total efficiency of all ion - atom absorption processes is close , or even larger than the efficiency of the referent electron - atom processes ( h@xmath29-continuum ) in the largest part of the mentioned interval of @xmath43 .",
    "this means that in the case of the sunspot it is needed to consider the discussed ion - atom absorption process in the mentioned part of the far uv region ( 110 nm @xmath7 230 nm ) always together with the referent electron - atom processes ( h@xmath29-continuum ) .",
    "consequently , the considered ion - atom processes should be also included _ ab initio _ in the corresponding models of sunspots of solar - type and near solar - type stars .",
    "due to possible future investigations of these ion - atom processes , the needed spectral rate coefficients are determined and presented in appendix b. since the ion - atom processes of the type ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) with @xmath5 = li could be interesting in connection with the so called lithium stars ( mentioned in the introduction ) , the corresponding spectral rate coefficients are also presented in this appendix .",
    "from the presented material it follows that the considered symmetric and non - symmetric ion - atom absorption processes influence on the opacity of sunspots in the considered spectral region ( 110 nm @xmath7 230 nm ) not less and in some parts even larger than the referent electron - atom processes .",
    "the presented results show that further investigations of the non - symmetric ion - atom absorption processes promise that their efficiency could be increased considerably .",
    "namely , the processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) with @xmath6 fe were not considered here because of the absence of the data about the needed characteristics of the corresponding molecular ion .",
    "however the fe component , according to fig .",
    "[ fig : abund ] , gives the significant contribution to the electron density .",
    "also , some of the possible processes of the ( satellite ) type ( [ eq : sat1 ] ) - ( [ eq : sat2 ] ) could be very efficient .",
    "it means that the inclusion in the consideration of all possible relevant non - symmetric ion - atom absorption processes would surely increase their total efficiency . because of that",
    ", we take such inclusion as the task for the investigations in the nearest future . for this purpose , here are presented the spectral characteristics of the considered ion - atom absorption processes which can be used in some further applications .",
    "finally , the presented results show that in far uv region the significance of the considered ion - atom absorption processes is sufficiently large that they should be included _",
    "ab initio _ in the corresponding models of the sunspots .",
    "apart of that , obtained results could be useful also in the case of different solar like atmospheres .",
