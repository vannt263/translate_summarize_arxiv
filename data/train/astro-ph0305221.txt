    "the dual - frequency radio measurements are not good enough to seriously constrain the radio spectrum ( see table  1 ) .",
    "they are in most cases consistent with both flat ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the radio flux density at a certain frequency @xmath27 ) spectrum radio emission as observed from low / hard state black holes , or the optically thin emission ( @xmath28 ) observed from x - ray transients ( i.e. non - simultaneous observation : @xmath29 ; _ g _ : @xmath30 ; _ h _ : @xmath31 ; _ i _ : @xmath32 ; _ j _ : @xmath33 ; _ k _ : @xmath34 ; _ l _ : @xmath35 ) .",

[ fr - fx ] have @xmath41 of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 for blackbody , power - law and total x - ray flux respectively ) .",

    "there is also a hint ( with only four points , treating with caution the observation _",
    "g _ ; see also   5 ) of a correlation between l@xmath20 frequency and the radio flux density .",
    "an opposite ( qualitative ) behaviour was found by muno et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the bhc grs  1915 + 105 ; they found that the ` radio plateau ' observations ( i.e. radio flux densities @xmath48  mjy at 15.2  ghz ) show lower 0.510  hz qpo frequencies than ` radio faint ' observations ( i.e. radio flux densities @xmath49 20  mjy at 15.2  ghz ) .",
    "the qpo frequencies are generally interpreted as being related to the motion of matter in the accretion disc at a certain radius . in particular , in low magnetic field ns systems , the khz qpos are thought to be related to motion of matter a few stellar radii from the star ( see van der klis 2000 for a review ) , and , as in e.g. miller , lamb and psaltis ( 1998 ) , correspond to the inner radius of the keplerian disc .",
    "according to most models ( see e.g. van der klis 2001 and references therein ) the khz qpos ( and also other timing features like the break and l@xmath18 that generally correlate with them ; di  salvo et al .",
    "2000 ; mndez , van der klis & ford 2001 ; van straaten et al .",
    "2002 ) are related to the disc mass accretion rate .",
    "therefore our radio flux / x - ray timing correlations represent independent ( i.e. different from radio : x - ray flux correlations ) evidence for a coupling between accretion and outflow rates . as a caveat , we note that the correlations discussed above are dominated by the difference between the two blocks of data , in 2000 and 2001 respectively . while the correlations themselves are not in doubt , further observations are required to establish if there is a smooth relation between the blocks or a more bimodal form of behaviour .",
    "we know that the x - ray flux does not trivially trace the disc mass accretion rate ; ` parallel tracks ' are observed between khz qpo frequencies and x - ray luminosity ( e.g. mndez et al .",
    "1999 ; ford et al .",
    "2000 ; mndez et al .",
    "the strong coupling between spectral and timing properties in x - ray binaries , suggests that the qpos are actually a more straightforward indicator , rather than luminosity , if not of the absolute value of @xmath50 at least of variations of the disc mass accretion rate and maybe of the inner radius of the accretion disc ( see van der klis 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , the radio : x - ray flux and even more the radio flux / x - ray timing correlations translate into the first evidence for a coupling between the accretion disc inflow and the jet outflow in an atoll source .    4u 172834 shows a correlation between radio flux density and x - ray flux qualitatively similar to that found for bhcs in the low / hard state ( hannikainen et al .",
    "1998 ; corbel et al .",
    "2000 ; corbel et al . 2002 ; gallo et al .",
    "2003 ) , although the index @xmath41 of the coupling ( see fig .",
    "3 ) is rather steeper . the observation _",
    "( star in fig .",
    "[ fr - fx ] , has the highest x - ray flux in our sample and a low ( compared to what ` expected ' from the radio : x - ray flux correlation we have found for the other observations ) radio flux density . since _",
    "g _ shows the same low frequency timing properties of the other observations in 2001 , this high x - ray flux can be interpreted as due to a ` parallel track ' effect ( see e.g. mndez et al .",
    "furthermore , in the power spectrum , although the low frequency features are in agreement with previous observations at the same position in the cd , the relative strengths of the khz qpos we find ( the ` lower ' khz qpo is stronger than the ` upper ' ) are usually observed in softer observations , i.e. in the banana state rather than in the is ( e.g. van straaten et al .",
    "2000 ) . a comparison with bhcs ( see e.g. gallo et al . 2003 )",
    "also show that _ g _ is almost at the same x - ray luminosity ( using a distance of 5.2  kpc : galloway et al .",
    "2002 ) as the ` radio quenching ' in bhcs ; this suggests ( nothing more than this , since it is only one point ) that suppression ( ` quenching ' ) of the radio jet may occur above some luminosity , as in bhcs .",
    "it is interesting to note that 4u 172834 , at the same x - ray luminosity as e.g. cyg x-1 ( gallo et al .",
    "2003 ) , show a radio luminosity @xmath51 times less than cyg x-1 ( i.e. scaled to 1 kpc the radio flux densities are @xmath52  mjy and @xmath53  mjy ) .",
    "this confirms ( also quantitively ) the fender & kuulkers ( 2000 ) finding of radio ` loudness ' difference between atoll - type nss and bhcs .",
    "x - ray ( i.e. mainly accretion ) properties in atoll sources and in bhcs ( in low / hard state ) seem to be qualitatively the same ( e.g. van der klis 1994 ) .",
    "this suggests that the same physical processes take place in both type of sources .",
    "what about the physical processes that connect inflow ( disc ) and outflow ( jet ) matter in x - ray binaries ?",
    "the key to answering this question lies in the study of atoll vs bhcs disc - jet coupling .",
    "the results presented in this paper may be a first step in that direction .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
