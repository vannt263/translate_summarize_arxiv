    "we can concentrate ourselves on the equatorial plane because of spherical symmetry . using the conservation of the energy @xmath13 and angular momentum @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the photon wave number , the photon trajectory is then given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the impact parameter of the photon .",

    "note that we have assumed @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the deflection angle can be expressed @xmath58 , where @xmath37 is a non - negative integer , denoting the winding number of the light ray .",
    "the ring image corresponds to the image angle @xmath49 for vanishing real angle @xmath59 . by the symmetry ,",
    "the image is necessarily a ring with the diameter angle @xmath49 .    since @xmath60 , we find that the ring image is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a unique root of the transcendental equation @xmath63 we should note that @xmath64 is monotonically increasing with respect to @xmath65 and changes from @xmath66 to @xmath67 as @xmath65 increases from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "the uniqueness of the root follows from the monotonicity .",
    "moreover , we can conclude that @xmath70 monotonically increases and approaches 1 as @xmath71 and hence the image angle @xmath72 monotonically decreases and approaches @xmath73 .    in the weak - field regime @xmath40",
    ", the winding number @xmath37 should be @xmath74 . using the deflection angle ( [ eq : weak_field_deflection_angle ] )",
    ", we can solve the equation ( [ eq : transcendental ] ) approximately and get the diameter angle of the einstein ring @xmath75 this approximation is good for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the relative error is @xmath78 for @xmath79pc and @xmath80 mpc .    in the especially strong - field regime , where the winding number @xmath37 becomes @xmath81 , we can easily check that @xmath82 or @xmath83 satisfies the transcendental equation ( [ eq : transcendental ] ) in numerical calculations .",
    "physically this means that the light rays which wind around the wormhole nearly on the photon sphere make the relativistic einstein rings @xcite .",
    "then the diameter angles of the relativistic einstein rings are approximately given by @xmath84 regardless of the values of @xmath46 , @xmath45 and @xmath7 , the relative error of the above approximation to the direct numerical solution of the outermost relativistic einstein ring ( @xmath85 ) is @xmath86 and those of the other relativistic einstein rings ( @xmath87 ) are smaller than @xmath88 .",
    "this implies that it is difficult to resolve each relativistic einstein ring separately .",
    "thus , we conclude that there is one einstein - ring image and countably infinite relativistic einstein - ring images , the latter of which accumulate to form the apparently single ring image of the throat with the diameter @xmath73",
    ". this conclusion does not depend on the value of @xmath89 .",
    "if we are given the distance @xmath90 to the source from the observer , the distance @xmath45 to the lens from the observer and the radius @xmath91 of the einstein ring , we can determine the radius of the throat @xmath7 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : worm_einstein_ring ] ) .",
    "then , we can use @xmath92 ( [ eq : worm_relativistic_einstein_ring ] ) to test the assumption that the lens object is a wormhole .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : worm_einstein_ring ] ) and ( [ eq : worm_relativistic_einstein_ring ] ) we obtain the relation between @xmath91 and @xmath92 by @xmath93 this relation generally holds in astrophysical situations , as long as @xmath94 and @xmath95 are satisfied .",
    "if the lens is identified with a wormhole , we can even estimate the radius of the wormhole throat in terms of @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath72 through @xmath96 this follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : theta_n_wormhole ] ) and ( [ eq : theta_0_n_wormhole ] ) .",
    "in this section we compare the einstein ring and the relativistic einstein rings in the ellis spacetime to the ones in the schwarzschild spacetime and show that we can distinguish between black holes and wormholes .",
    "now , we will briefly review the deflection angle , einstein ring and relativistic einstein rings for the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite and present the relation between @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    in the weak - field regime @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole of mass @xmath99 , the deflection angle is approximately given by @xmath100 the diameter angle of the einstein ring is given by @xmath101 we can determine @xmath102 in the same way as the radius of the throat @xmath7 .",
    "in the especially strong - field regime , where the winding number @xmath37 becomes @xmath81 , the impact parameter @xmath50 that satisfies the lens equation should be nearly the critical impact parameter @xmath103 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then the diameter angles of the inseparable relativistic einstein rings @xmath92 are given by @xmath104    it is useful to remember that the leading term of the deflection angle in the weak - field regime is the second order of the small amount @xmath105 on the ellis geometry ( [ eq : weak_field_deflection_angle ] ) , while it is the first order of the small amount @xmath106 on the schwarzschild geometry ( [ eq : weak_field_deflection_angle_black_hole ] ) .",
    "so the relation between @xmath91 and @xmath92 for the schwarzschild spacetime @xmath107 is different from that on the ellis spacetime ( [ eq : thata_ralation_ellis ] ) .",
    "2 shows the angle of the relativistic einstein ring @xmath92 versus the angle of the einstein ring @xmath91 for @xmath80mpc .",
    "thus , we can distinguish between black holes and wormholes in principle if we are given @xmath90 , @xmath45 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "versus the angle of the einstein ring @xmath91 for @xmath80mpc .",
    "the broken ( green ) and solid ( red ) lines plot the cases where the lens objects are a wormhole and a black hole , respectively .",
    ", width=328 ]    if the lens is identified with a black hole , we can estimate the schwarzschild radius and , hence , the black hole mass by @xmath108 in terms of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath90 .",
    "this follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : theta_n_blackhole ] ) and ( [ eq : theta_n_0_blackhole ] ) .",
    "it is well known that the qualitative features of the gravitational lensing on the ellis spacetime are very similar to the ones on the schwarzschild spacetime for their photon spheres and their asymptotic flatness @xcite .",
    "however , we realize that their quantitative features are very different due to their different weak - field behaviors .",
    "we consider the experimental situation where we know the separation @xmath90 between the observer and the source and the separation @xmath45 between the observer and the lens .",
    "we assume that we do not know whether the lens object is a black bole or a wormhole and do not know its parameter , i.e. , the mass @xmath99 or the radius @xmath7 of the throat in advance .",
    "we need at least two observable quantities to determine whether the lens object is a black hole or wormhole since the lens system has one parameter in this situation .",
    "first , we observe an einstein ring and determine the parameter for both possibilities .",
    "second , we observe relativistic einstein rings and tell the wormhole from the black hole . if the predicted relativistic ring angles by the black hole and by the wormhole were of similar size , we could not discern the difference .",
    "however , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : thata_ralation_ellis ] ) , ( [ eq : relation_diameter_angle_black_hole ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] show that we do not confuse them .",
    "we conclude that we can detect the relativistic einstein rings by wormholes which have @xmath0pc at a galactic center with the distance @xmath80mpc and which have @xmath2au in our galaxy with the distance @xmath80kpc using the most powerful modern instruments which have the resolution of @xmath3arcsecond such as a @xmath1-meter optical - infrared telescope .",
    "note that the corresponding black holes which have the einstein rings of the same size are galactic supermassive black holes with @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively , and that the relativistic einstein rings by these black holes are too small to measure with the current technology .",
    "in fact , our results imply that we can distinguish between slowly rotating kerr - newmann black holes and the ellis wormholes with their einstein - ring systems .",
    "this is because the leading term of the deflection angle for the lensing by the kerr - newmann black holes in the weak - field regime is equal to the one for the lensing by the schwarzschild black holes , while the black hole charge and small spin only slightly change the radii of the relativistic einstein rings @xcite .",
    "moreover , this also suggests that it is much more challenging to determine the charge and/or small spin of black holes than to distinguish between black holes and the ellis wormholes .",
    "we assumed that the observer , the lensing object and the source object are directly - aligned , though such a configuration is fairly rare .",
    "in general the strong gravitational lensing effect is observed as broken - ring images which are called relativistic images @xcite .",
    "therefore , more realistic problem is to size the relativistic images .",
    "our result suggests that we can distinguish black holes and wormholes by using the relativistic images .",
    "to observe the relativistic images is one of the challenging works with many difficulties .",
    "_ pointed out that relativistic images are always very faint with respect to the weak field images @xcite .",
    "the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) has high resolution @xcite but it will not work because of this demagnifying effect .",
    "we also assumed point - like sources , although astrophysical sources have their own size .",
    "if the source object is a galaxy , it may conceal the relativistic einstein rings , especially , in the case that the lens object is a black hole . testing some hypotheses of astrophysical wormholes by using the relativistic einstein rings and the einstein ring",
    "is left as future work .",
    "tejeiro and larranaga @xcite investigated the gravitational lensing effect of the wormhole solution obtained by connecting the ellis solution as an interior region and the schwarzschild solution as an exterior region @xcite .",
    "they concluded that we can not distinguish the schwarzschild black hole and the wormhole unless the discontinuity of the magnification curve at the boundary is observed .",
    "this does not contradict our results because their wormhole solution behaves as the schwarzschild solution in the weak - field regime .",
