    "the paper @xcite describes the construction of an extremal even unimodular lattice @xmath0 of dimension 72 of which the existence was a longstanding open problem .",
    "there are at least three independent proofs of extremality of this lattice , two of them are given in @xcite and rely heavily on computations within the set of minimal vectors of the leech lattice .",
    "the other one is also highly computational and uses the methods of @xcite .",
    "all these proofs do not give much structural insight why this lattice is extremal .",
    "the present paper uses the construction of @xmath0 as a hermitian tensor product to derive a more structural proof of extremality of @xmath0 with the methods in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the computational complexity of this new proof is far lower than the previously known ones .",

    "being ( uni-)modular implies certain invariance properties of the theta series of @xmath5 .",
    "in particular the theta series of an even unimodular lattice is a modular form for the full modular group @xmath7 .",
    "the theory of modular forms allows to show that the _ minimum _ @xmath8 of @xmath5 is bounded from above by @xmath9 .",
    "lattices achieving equality are called _",
    "extremal_.    several examples of extremal ( uni-)modular lattices obtained as hermitian tensor products of lower dimensional lattices were already known , see for instance @xcite for a construction of extremal lattices of dimension @xmath10 and @xmath11 related to the mathieu group @xmath12 .",
    "this situation is nevertheless rather exceptional .",
    "briefly , in order that a tensor product @xmath13 gives rise to a dense sphere packing , it has to contain simultaneously _ split _ and _ non split _ short vectors . obviously , the minimal length of a split vector @xmath14 is exactly @xmath15 while the minimal length of a non split vector @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) will usually be strictly smaller .",
    "the challenge , when allowing non split minimal vectors , is thus precisely to prevent their minimal length from dropping .    in the first section of this note ,",

    ", we comment on the behaviour of tensor product with respect to the associated sphere packing density . roughly speaking",
    ", we show that the tensor product of two lattices over @xmath18 of small dimension can not achieve a maximal density , even locally see proposition [ prop1 ] and its corollary ( here `` small '' means `` less than @xmath19 '' ) .    in contrast , tensor product over small field extensions , _",

    "these are then applied to give a construction of one extremal even unimodular 48-dimensional lattices as a hermitian tensor product over @xmath22 $ ] in section 4 before we give a new proof of the extremality of @xmath0 in section 5 .",
