    "dissociative recombination ( dr ) of the simplest polyatomic ion h@xmath0 @xmath1 has been studied for several decades both in experiment and theory @xcite",
    ". the measured rate of the reaction is relatively fast @xcite for electron energies below 1 ev , which was eventually attributed to the strong jahn - teller coupling between vibrational motion of the ion and the incident @xmath2-wave in the electronic continuum @xcite .",
    "currently , there is general agreement between theory @xcite and most recent experiments @xcite for the dr rate coefficient in h@xmath0 .",
    "however , the detailed energy dependence of the theoretical rate coefficient @xcite in the range 0 - 2 ev exhibits differences from the rate coefficient measured in recent high resolution storage ring experiments @xcite .",
    "one prominent point of disagreement is the much more pronounced resonance structure in the theoretical rate coefficient ; this plethora of resonances is associated with rydberg states of the neutral molecule h@xmath3 .",
    "although similar resonance structure is visible in the experimental data , it is much less pronounced .",
    "dissociative recombination of h@xmath0 is a four - body problem : because the dr process starts with an electron - h@xmath0 collision , one must account for the motion of the electron and its coupling with the molecular degrees of freedom . in order to represent jahn - teller coupling between electronic and vibrational motion",
    ", one must take into account at least two degrees of freedom of vibrational motion ( two hyperangles in our approach ) .",
    "finally , the third vibrational coordinate ( the hyper - radius ) should be included in order to describe the dissociative channel .",
    "therefore , the theoretical approach includes several ingredients @xcite and a number of approximations were made to simplify the calculations in our previous theoretical study @xcite .",
    "one of the important approximations used in refs .",
    "@xcite is the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation : motion in the hyper - radial coordinate was treated as adiabatic compared to motion in the hyperangles , i.e. motion in the hyperangles was considered to be much faster than motion in the hyper - radius .",
    "correspondingly , vibrational states @xmath4 of the ion have been represented as simple products of hyperangular and hyper - radial functions .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , this approximation describes reasonably well ( at about the 1% level ) vibrational energies of the ion for the low vibrational states in low - lying hyperspherical potential curves ( see table [ table : vibr_energies ] ) . for excited vibrational states with energies higher than 1 ev above the ground rovibrational level ,",
    "the error increased to the vicinity of 10 mev .",
    "such highly excited vibrational states may support rydberg states of the neutral h@xmath3 molecule in the energy region corresponding to the low - energy dr process under consideration .",
    "accordingly , the absolute positions of such rydberg states were presumably calculated with an error of about 10 mev . we should also mention that the highest vibrational levels that must be included in our theoretical treatment ( in order to represent the initial dissociation of the neutral molecule ) have around 4 ev of vibrational energy .",
    "another source of error in the position of rydberg states is the neglected energy - dependence of quantum defects used in refs .",
    "analysis of an _ ab initio _",
    "calculation @xcite shows that the quantum defects are in fact only weakly energy - dependent close to the equilibrium geometry of the molecular ion . the maximum error in positions of rydberg states for @xmath5 associated with this approximation",
    "is estimated to be around 10 - 15 mev , at least for rydberg states close to that equilibrium configuration .",
    "certain rydberg states appear in the dr spectrum as resonances and , therefore , play an important role in the detailed comparison of the theoretical dr rate coefficient with the high - resolution experimental data . on the other hand",
    ", the dr rate coefficient that has been thermally averaged over a maxwell - boltzmann distribution should be comparatively insensitive to the detailed positions of rydberg states , as long as the average level density and the resonance widths are described correctly .",
    "indeed , the theoretical thermal rate coefficient calculated in the previous study @xcite agrees with the experimentally - measured thermal rate coefficient .",
    "the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation implemented previously for the ionic vibrational eigenstate calculation neglected all non - adiabatic coupling between different adiabatic channels .",
    "this approximation could also adversely affect the calculated dr rate coefficient since the main dr mechanism in h@xmath0 is indirect : neglect of some non - adiabatic effects might therefore be expected to cause an underestimation of the theoretical dr rate coefficient .",
    "however , the most important coupling responsible for the high dr rate coefficient of h@xmath0 is non - born - oppenheimer jahn - teller coupling , which has been accounted for in the previous study .",
    "finally , in the previous study only a few rotational levels of the initial state of the ion were included up to @xmath6 .",
    "( the rotational state ( 3,1 ) was not included . here and below we use the generally accepted notations for rotational states of the ion @xcite , where the two numbers in ( ) are the total angular momentum @xmath7 of the ion and its projection @xmath8 on the ionic symmetry axis . )",
    "the inclusion of a larger number of rotational states has since been recognized as possibly important due to the following : if the electron energy is high enough , there is a large probability that the h@xmath0 ion is excited into a higher rotational level @xcite .",
    "in fact , the probability of this rotational excitation is high enough to be competitive with the dr process .",
    "thus , for electron energies above 10 mev , higher rotational states of the ion could be populated in the storage ring even though , initially , the ionic beam has been prepared in the ground rovibrational state .",
    "excitations can happen , for instance , when the ions pass through the toroidal region or the electron cooler @xcite .",
    "the present study improves upon two of the three approximations discussed above .",
    "first , we calculate accurate vibrational states of the ion instead of relying on the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation ; the adiabatic hyperspherical _ representation _ is still utilized , but since channel coupling is now included , the calculated eigenspectrum can be made arbitrarily accurate , in principle .",
    "second , we account for a larger number of initial rotational states .",
    "finally , we calculate the rate coefficients of dr processes that start from two different excited vibrational states of h@xmath0 .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly summarizes our theoretical approach and , in particular , the method to obtain accurate vibrational energies and wave functions of the ion .",
    "section [ sec : averaging ] discusses the various averaging procedures that must be performed on the raw theoretical dr rate coefficient in order to compare theory with the data from existing storage ring experiments .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents our results and section [ sec : conclusion ] gives our conclusions .",
    "the procedure of calculation of the cross - section is very similar to that described in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize the main steps .",
    "the treatment is based on construction of the multi - channel electron - h@xmath0 scattering matrix @xmath9 .",
    "the asymptotic channels @xmath10 of the matrix corresponds to different rovibrational levels of the ion . after a collision with the electron the rovibrational state of the ion may change : @xmath11 however , the collision conserves the overall symmetry of the system .",
    "( that is , @xmath9 is diagonal in the irreducible representation @xmath12 of the symmetry group @xmath13 of the hamiltonian . )",
    "we assume that the electronic state of the ion is the ground @xmath14 state . since protons are fermions , for h@xmath0 in the ground electronic state , the allowed irreducible representations of the total nuclear wave function ( including space and nuclear spin coordinates ) are @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the @xmath13 symmetry group .",
    "when the scattering matrix @xmath17 is constructed , highly excited vibrational levels of h@xmath0 are included .",
    "these vibrational levels in fact represent the discretized vibrational continuum , and they have finite lifetimes with respect to dissociation .",
    "the energy of the incident electron is not high enough for these levels to represent open channels for dissociative ionization , but the electron can be captured into the rydberg states attached to the highly excited levels .",
    "if this happens , the system dissociates instead of ionizing , because such low principle quantum number rydberg states are locally open for dissociation .",
    "this causes the electron - ion scattering matrix @xmath18 to be non - unitary , and the ` defect ' from unitarity of the relevant columns of @xmath18 can be identified with the dissociation probability .",
    "the total wave function of the ion - electron system is constructed by taking into account all symmetry restrictions determined by the two allowed irreducible representations of the system , which is discussed in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "the wave functions of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 irreducible representations of the channel states @xmath10 are constructed from the product of the rotational , vibrational , nuclear , and electronic degrees of freedom of the system ( see also eqs .",
    "( 2 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath19 the operator @xmath20 projects the product @xmath21 on the corresponding irreducible representation , @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "each factor in the second equation is calculated by the diagonalization of the respective hamiltonian , except @xmath22 . in the above equation",
    ", @xmath23 is the rotational wave function of the ion , @xmath24 is the vibrational wave function , @xmath25 is the nuclear spin wave function , and @xmath22 represents the wave function of the incoming electron .",
    "the functions @xmath22 do not diagonalize completely the clamped - nucleus electronic hamiltonian ; the matrix of the electronic hamiltonian represented by @xmath22 has non - diagonal elements responsible for jahn - teller coupling in h@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the rotational , nuclear spin , and electronic functions in the product @xmath21 are represented in the same way as in our previous study , ref .",
    "but the vibrational part @xmath24 is obtained differently here , because we no longer utilize the hyperspherical adiabatic approximation @xcite . in that approximation ,",
    "the non - adiabatic couplings between different hyperspherical adiabatic states of the same vibrational symmetry were entirely neglected , an approximation that works reasonably well for low vibrational levels of h@xmath0 ion . in this study",
    "we use much better vibrational states calculated using the slow variable discretization ( svd ) approach @xcite , where non - adiabatic couplings are taken into account .",
    "table [ table : vibr_energies ] compares accuracy of calculations of the present approach with the hyperspherical adiabatic approach .",
    "the calculations of h@xmath0 vibrational states by jaquet _",
    "@xcite , obtained for the same born - oppenheimer ionic surface that we use here @xcite , are taken as an ` exact ' reference .",
    "once @xmath21 are known , the matrix elements @xmath17 are calculated from the scattering matrix @xmath27 depending on three distances between protons in h@xmath0 and describing the @xmath28+h@xmath0 collision in the molecular frame , where the appropriate quantum numbers are projection @xmath29 of the electronic orbital momentum on the ionic principal axis and the set of internuclear coordinates @xmath30 . as in the previous study @xcite , we consider only the ` @xmath31wave ' of the electron , when it moves beyond the range of the ionic core .",
    "the nonspherical nature of the electron - ion interaction potential undoubtedly mixes other electronic orbital momenta when the electron is at short range , but scattering calculations have shown that the probability for an incident @xmath32 electron to scatter into an @xmath33 or @xmath34 orbital momenta is quite low in this near - threshold energy range .",
    "the matrix @xmath27 is obtained from the reaction matrix @xmath35 given by formulas in refs .",
    "@xcite . as was mentioned above , the electronic hamiltonian and , correspondingly",
    ", the matrices related to body - frame scattering , i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath36 , are not diagonal .",
    "the nonzero off - diagonal elements @xmath37/@xmath38 are due to the jahn - teller coupling .",
    "when the total energy of the @xmath28+h@xmath0 system is not high enough for all the channels @xmath10 to be energetically open for ionization , the usual situation , the physically meaningful scattering matrix @xmath39 is obtained from @xmath17 by the standard closed - channel elimination procedure of multi - channel quantum defect theory ( mqdt ) @xcite .",
    "the dissociative recombination rate coefficient is then calculated using the unitarity ` defect ' of the corresponding columns of @xmath40 @xcite . in order to compare our results with the data from storage ring experiments , we carry out a number of averaging procedures in order to model the experimental conditions , as detailed below .",
    ".accuracy test of the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation and the improved coupled - channels hyperspherical calculation adopted for the computations presented in this paper .",
    "specifically , this table compares several vibrational energies in @xmath41 calculated in the present approach with the older adiabatic approximation results and those taken from a full three - dimensional diagonalization @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ fig : alpha_sr_dif_rot ] demonstrates the theoretical dr rate coefficients we obtain for different ionic rotational temperatures @xmath42 . the results with higher @xmath42 agree better with the experiments than when the experimentally estimated rotational temperature is adopted .",
    "while this better agreement at a higher rotational temperature could be fortuitous , our results suggest that it is worth exploring whether the rotational temperature in both of the recent storage - ring experiments @xcite might be larger than 40  k or 13  k , respectively .",
    "( 40  k and 13  k are the estimated rotational temperatures in the two experiments ) . this conclusion would conflict with another suggestion by kreckel _",
    "@xcite , that only the two lowest rotational states are populated in the recent storage ring experiments @xcite and that , therefore , the rotational temperature @xmath42 is about 13  k40  k. in fact , it was demonstrated previously , that if the electron energy is high enough , the electron - ion collision might not only cause dr or result in an elastic collision , but it can also result in rotational excitation of the ions when they circulate in the storage ring @xcite . in all the tests we have carried out for temperatures in the range 13  k-40  k , the calculated dr rate coefficient has pronounced structure due to rydberg states present in the raw rate coefficient of eq .",
    "[ eq : cs ] .",
    "the experimental dr rate coefficient has some structure , but it is less pronounced than our averaged and convolved theoretical rate coefficient . since the resonances due to the rydberg states are smeared out in the experiments , it suggests the possibility that in the experiment there could be an additional source of broadening . the broadening could arise from a higher rotational temperature , from a broadened electron energy distribution , from additional broadening associated with the toroidal region , or perhaps from something else",
    "an alternative possibility that can not be ruled out is that our theoretical treatment might have underestimated the resonance widths . for the resonances that dominate the dr rate ,",
    "the predissociation partial width is larger than the autoionization partial width , and under those conditions , the calculated dr rate is comparatively insensitive to changes in the predissociation linewidth .",
    "thus , it would be a valuable benchmark for experiments ( or other , improved theories ) to determine the predissociation partial widths of individual resonances above the ionization threshold , to provide a direct test of the accuracy of our present calculations at the level of spectroscopic accuracy .",
    "one possible source of rotational excitation could be the repeated circulation of the molecular ions through electron cooler during the ramping of the cathode voltage @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite deduced that the rotational temperature is 40 k based on theoretical cross - sections of the rotational excitation of h@xmath0 given in ref .",
    "since then , the cross - sections have been reconsidered and corrected @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , we revisit here the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite based on the new inelastic probabilities determined by ref .",
    "if we take the ( 1,1)@xmath43(2,1 ) rotational excitation cross - section to be 710 @xmath44 from ref .",
    "@xcite instead of 210 @xmath44 from ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the relative population 7.5% instead of 2.2% in ref .",
    "if we take the ( 1,0)@xmath43(3,0 ) rotational excitation cross - section to be 270 @xmath44 from ref .",
    "@xcite instead of 120 @xmath44 from ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the relative population 4.6% instead of 2.0% in ref .",
    "the relative population 7.5% of the ( 2,1 ) states corresponds to the temperature @xmath42=96  k , the relative population 4.6% of the ( 3,0 ) states gives @xmath42=210  k. both values of the temperature are significantly higher than the values ( 40  k and 13  k ) quoted in the experimental papers , although not as high as 1000k , in our present estimation .",
    "the disagreement between the current theory and experimental data around energy @xmath45  6  mev ( see fig . [",
    "fig : alpha_sr ] ) could be caused by errors in the calculated positions of rydberg states in that region , which are attached to highly - excited rovibrational levels of the ion . in our calculation",
    ", we use energy - independent quantum defects even though they depend weakly on the principal quantum number .",
    "in addition , the accuracy of calculation of energies for the highly - excited rovibrational levels may be of the order of 6  mev .",
    "note that there is also a disagreement with experiment in the region of very small energies , below 0.2 mev .",
    "this region is well below the net effective energy resolution of the experiment ( @xmath462 mev ) .",
    "the experimental rate coefficient appears to behave there as @xmath47 , which is the same total energy dependence expected for the raw , unconvolved dr rate coefficient .",
    "however , in our theoretical calculation , we of course included the convolution according to the perpendicular energy distribution with the width @xmath462 mev .",
    "this makes the convolved theoretical dr rate coefficient become essentially flat at very low energy @xmath48 mev even though the raw theoretical rate coefficient also grows as @xmath49 at very low energy .",
    "this suggests that in the experiment , the distribution of relative electron energies could be even more complicated than discussed above , and in particular , the resolution might be even better at very low energies than the quoted energy resolution .",
    "another possible explanation for the disagreement is that a rydberg resonance exists in h@xmath26 at an energy just above ( + 0.3 mev ) the ( 1,1 ) rotational state of the ion .",
    "the predissociation linewidth of the resonance must also be of the order 0.3 mev .",
    "we have made a simple test calculation in which we artificially tuned one of the rydberg resonance to be placed just above the ( 1,1 ) ionization threshold .",
    "the resulting theoretical dr rate coefficient looks very similar to the experimental dr rate coefficients at energies below 0.5 mev .",
    "therefore , the sharp increase of the experimental dr rate coefficient for energies below 0.3 mev requires additional consideration .",
    "similar discrepancies have been observed between dr theory and experiment at very low parallel energies , in other systems such as lih@xmath50,@xcite so this could be a systematic issue for theory and experiment to confront which extends beyond the h@xmath0 system alone .",

    "however , the improved agreement with the experimental data in that energy range was only obtained when we assume that the rotational temperature @xmath42 of h@xmath0 is significantly larger than 40  k and 13  k , the values given in the experimental study @xcite . since no direct measurement of the temperature has actually been made inside the storage ring in those experiments ( except indirectly for zero - energy collisions ) , there is a possibility that the ions get rotationally excited before the dr rate coefficient measurements are conducted .",
    "it was shown previously that the probability of rotational excitation of the ion by electrons is comparable to or larger than the dr probability , at energies where rotational excitation is energetically allowed .",
    "thus , the rotational temperature in the experiment could be larger than 40 k or the ions might not even be in thermal equilibrium at any temperature .",
    "thus , it would be desirable to monitor the rotational temperature during the dr measurement .",
    "another possibile way to explore this effect is to artificially increase the temperature of the electron cooler or the width @xmath63 during the dr measurements and ascertain the temperature at which the dr rate coefficient starts to become sensitive to the temperature .",
    "we have calculated the dr rate coefficients for separate ortho- and para - configurations of h@xmath0 . at energies below 10 mev ,",
    "the dr rate coefficient for para - h@xmath0 is an order of magnitude larger than for ortho - h@xmath0 .",
    "the experiment also shows that the para - h@xmath0 dr rate coefficient is larger .",
    "however , since the ortho-/para - ratio in the experiment is not known it is not clear what is experimental dr rate coefficients for pure para - h@xmath0 and ortho - h@xmath0 .",
    "our previous calculations stressed that the ortho - para ratio of dr rates at very low collision energies should be used with some caution , because the rates at energies below 100k begin to get very sensitive to the specific resonance positions at the mev level .",
    "those cautionary remarks are still applicable to the present results for the ratio of ortho and para dr rates at low energy . however ,",
    "if the present order - of - magnitude difference of the low energy dr rate survives future improvements in theory and experiment , it will be interesting to explore possible implications of this difference for the chemistry of interstellar clouds .    finally , the calculated dr rate coefficient for ions prepared in excited vibrational states is larger than in the ground vibrational state .",
    "our new theoretical values for the dr rate coefficients of excited vibrational states will hopefully be tested one day in a storage - ring experiment .",
    "currently , experimental dr measurements are made after the ions have been cooled . in principle",
    ", it seems possible to carry out this measurement using vibrationally - hot ions and , to monitor the dr rate coefficient as a function of the vibrational temperature .",
