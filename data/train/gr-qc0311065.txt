    "in recent years modified dispersion relations which break lorentz invariance have appeared in different contexts of gravitational physics .    on the one hand , they appeared in several works which address the so - called _ trans - planckian problem _ @xcite . in black hole physics",
    "the modes responsible for hawking radiation reach arbitrarily high energies near the black hole horizon when measured by a free - falling observer .",
    "this observation has lead some authors to study the robustness of hawking radiation when modifying ( from the outset ) the dispersion relation beyond the planck scale @xcite .",
    "a similar problem appears in inflationary cosmology : the modes responsible for the large scale structure had length scales much smaller than the planck length in the early stages of inflation .",
    "therefore it is of interest to determine to what extent the properties of the fluctuation spectrum are sensitive to modifications of the dispersion relation at the planck scale @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the introduction of a nontrivial dispersion relation has been originally suggested by formal analogies with condensed matter @xcite .",
    "however , the main physical motivation is that unknown effects of quantum gravity ( such as radiative corrections ) might introduce nontrivial dispersion relations in these contexts .",
    "following t hooft s @xcite observation that strong gravitational interactions in the near horizon region might alter the semiclassical description of black hole evaporation , a first dynamical realisation of this line of sought has been pursued in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there have been hints from high energy astroparticle physics that we could already see the effects of a violation of the lorentz symmetry .",
    "in particular modified dispersion relations have been used in order to provide an explanation for observations of ultrahigh energetic cosmic rays ( with energies higher than @xmath0 ) beyond the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff @xcite . as in the trans - planckian problem ,",
    "several dispersion relations have been exploited , inspired by various approaches to quantum gravity @xcite , string theory @xcite , non - conmutative field theory @xcite , variation of couplings @xcite and multiverses @xcite .",
    "modified dispersion relations often break the energy degeneracy for a given three - momentum : the particle energy can become helicity dependent @xcite and light can become birefringent @xcite .",
    "a popular form for these modified dispersion relations below the planck scale is , in the cosmological rest frame , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is planck s mass and @xmath3 are coefficients of order 1 if the planck mass is the relevant scale .",
    "et al . _  have studied the constraints on the possible values of the parameters @xmath3 based on current astrophysical observational data @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that both the real and imaginary parts @xmath4 are already observationally constrained to be much smaller than 1 .",
    "this shows that the `` natural '' assumption that the @xmath3 should be of order 1 is perhaps too naive .",
    "the possibility of quadratic modifications of the dispersion relation is also strongly constrained @xcite .    as we learned from particle physics",
    ", lorentz invariance is a key element in renormalized quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it might be broken by quantum gravity at a fundamental level , or , alternatively , it may be broken in an effective way in nontrivial backgrounds only . indeed in backgrounds which possess a preferred reference frame , radiative corrections to self - energies might contain terms which effectively break the ( local ) lorentz invariance _i.e .",
    "_ , the lorentz invariance in the tangent plane .",
    "let us emphasize that this second possibility does not imply any kind of fundamental breaking of the lorentz symmetry or any new physics . rather by `` effective breaking of the lorentz invariance '' we mean that radiative corrections to the dispersion relation may contain terms which depend on vector or tensor fields characterizing the background .    in this paper",
    "we explore a model in the framework of this second alternative .",
    "we consider the propagation of a scalar particle immersed in a thermal bath of gravitons .",
    "our aim is to determine how the inertia of the thermal bath affects the propagation of the scalar particle through radiative corrections . to this end",
    ", we shall compute the thermal corrections to its self - energy .",
    "the real part of the self - energy gives the thermal mass shift and might introduce as well a nontrivial dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part instead gives the rate of approach to thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in fact it is well known that quantum effects evaluated in nontrivial backgrounds induce non lorentz invariant terms in the dispersion relation .",
    "for instance , the self - energy of a charged fermion immersed in a thermal bath of photons has been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the effects of the thermal bath on the speed of light have been studied in refs .",
    "let us mention also that electromagnetic interaction in curved spacetimes also leads to modifications of the dispersion relations .",
    "the effect of qed vacuum polarization on the speed of light in nontrivial spacetimes has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , most calculations done so far do not concern gravitational interactions .",
    "gravity - induced corrections should be dominant at energies approaching the planck scale , hence relevant for the situations concerned with the trans - planckian problem .",
    "additionally notice that gravitational interactions are universal and not limited to charged particles .",
    "two important points concerning our approach should be mentioned . on the one hand ,",
    "since gravitational interactions are non - renormalizable , the system of the scalar field coupled to gravity should be conceived as an effective field theory @xcite .",
    "although the full theory is non - renormalizable , low - energy predictions which do not depend on the planck scale behavior of gravity can be extracted @xcite . on the other hand , since thermal corrections do not affect the ultraviolet properties of the theory , thermal field theory fits well with the effective theory approach . at a technical level",
    ", we shall incorporate the thermal effects through the real - time description of thermal field theory @xcite , which can be seen as a particular application of the closed - time path ( ctp ) method in field theory @xcite .",
    "we should also emphasize that we shall compute only the lowest order corrections .",
    "hence , we deal with free gravitons ; _ i.e. _ , we neglect the backreaction of the scalar field on the metric perturbations .",
    "the modifications to the metric propagator can be computed both in the framework of stochastic gravity @xcite or in the large-@xmath5 limit of quantum gravity @xcite ( both approaches can be seen to be equivalent @xcite ) .",
    "a computation along these lines ( but in the semiclassical approximation ) has been carried out by borgman and ford @xcite .",
    "they study the fluctuations in the focusing of a bundle of geodesics , propagating in a spacetime with metric perturbations induced by a thermal scalar field . to our knowledge , the higher order corrections to the self - energy have not yet been computed in the quantum field theoretical framework .",
    "gravity - mediated modifications of the dispersion relation have been also considered by burgess _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . working in the context of brane - world scenarios ,",
    "these authors compute the change to the dispersion relation of photons and fermions generated by interaction with four - dimensional effective gravitons . in that case",
    "the primary source of violation of the lorentz symmetry is the modification of the dispersion relation of effective four - dimensional gravitons induced by certain extra - dimensional configurations . similarly to our case , this modification is communicated to brane - bound particles through gravitational interactions .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the action for the system considered namely , a scalar field coupled to gravity . in sec .",
    "iii we compute perturbatively the leading correction to the self - energy of the scalar field at zero temperature . in sec .",
    "iv we assume that the scalar field and the gravitons are in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature , and compute the corrections to the retarded self - energy .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "v we analyze the results and discuss the physical significance of the terms which break lorenz invariance .",

    "[ app : tft ] we give a brief account of the real - time approach to thermal field theory .",
    "appendix [ app : abcd ] is mostly technical and is devoted to the calculation of certain integrals that appear in the calculation of the thermal contribution to the self - energy .    throughout this paper",
    "we shall use a system of units with @xmath6 .",
    "the signature of the metric will be @xmath7 .",
    "we consider a minimally coupled real scalar field @xmath8 of mass @xmath9 propagating in a spacetime characterized by a metric @xmath10 .",
    "the action for the field is    @xmath11    and the action for the metric is @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the ricci scalar , @xmath14 is the determinant of the metric , and @xmath15 is the gravitational coupling constant , with @xmath16 being newton s constant and @xmath17 being planck s length .",
    "assuming that the metric is a small perturbation of minkowski spacetime , @xmath18 , the complete action @xmath19 can be decomposed into the free scalar field , graviton and interaction actions as @xmath20 .",
    "these actions , expanded in powers of @xmath21 , are    @xmath22    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the stress tensor of the scalar field , @xmath25 and @xmath26 indices are raised and lowered with the background metric @xmath27 .",
    "we have kept only the free terms in the action for the gravitons @xmath28 because we shall only compute the lowest order corrections of the self - energy of the @xmath8 field .    to compute these corrections we need to introduce counterterms in order to cancel divergences . since",
    "our system is non - renormalizable , it has to be understood as an effective field theory , a low - energy approximation of a more fundamental theory at the planck scale @xcite . in order to compute to a given precision @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the energy of the process",
    ", one has to introduce all possible counterterms compatible with the symmetry whose coefficients are of order @xmath31 at most . in our case",

    "the finite coefficient @xmath37 is _ a priori _ unknown and constitutes an external input of the theory",
    ". the value of @xmath37 should be determined by experiments or by knowledge of the underlying more fundamental theory . on the other hand ,",
    "we do not introduce counterterms to the interaction action because we shall not compute vertex corrections .",
    "additionally the graviton action must be supplemented with a gauge - fixing term .",
    "we will work with the harmonic gauge @xmath38 , whose appropriate gauge - fixing action is @xcite @xmath39 no faddeev - popov ghost fields are needed since we will not consider graviton self - interactions .",
    "the aim in this section is to compute the leading contribution to the vacuum self - energy of the scalar particle . at zero temperature",
    "the self - energy @xmath40 is related to the feynman propagator @xmath41 through @xmath42 we recall that the self - energy can be computed as the sum of all one - particle irreducible diagrams with amputated external legs @xcite . in order to regulate divergences appearing in the calculation",
    "we will use dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "the two diagrams which may contribute to order @xmath32 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feydiag ] .",
    "one must also take into account the contribution of the counterterms : @xmath43 we first concentrate on the first diagram @xmath44 . applying the feynman rules described in appendix [ app : feyrules ] we find , in @xmath45 spacetime dimensions , @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given in appendix [ app : feyrules ] , and @xmath50 is an arbitrary mass scale .",

    "the complete specification of the on shell renormalization scheme also involves fixing the residue of the pole , which implies an additional condition on the derivative of the self - energy @xcite .",
    "however this second condition is found to be singular due to the divergence of the logarithms when evaluated on shell .",
    "this kind of singularity is generic for theories with interacting massless particles because of the absence of well defined asymptotic regions in the presence of long - range forces . for a discussion of this point in the case of qed",
    "see ref .",
    "anyway in the paper we are just interested position of the pole , which is always well defined .    note",
    "that the only divergence arises from the field renormalization .",
    "in particular , the four - derivative coefficient @xmath37 does not get renormalized : there are no logarithmic corrections to the @xmath64 term in the self - energy , and @xmath37 coincides with its classical value @xmath65 .",
    "therefore it would have been consistent not to include the four - derivative counterterm and simply take @xmath66 from the beginning .",
    "the self - energy develops a negative imaginary part for @xmath67 , @xmath68 which , according to the optical theorem @xcite , accounts for the probability of a scalar particle with momentum @xmath69 to decay into an on shell scalar and an on shell graviton .",
    "notice that on shell ( @xmath70 ) the imaginary part of the self - energy vanishes , because there is no phase space available for the spontaneous emission of a graviton .",
    "in this section we compute the thermal contribution to the self - energy working within the real - time approach to thermal field theory . in this approach , which is briefly explained in appendix [ app : tft ] , the number of degrees of freedom is doubled , and one has to consider four propagators organized in a @xmath71 matrix @xmath72 . the self - energy also becomes a matrix @xmath73 .",
    "we will concentrate on the retarded propagator @xmath74 for the following reasons : first , it is the one that exhibits simple analytical properties at finite temperature ( analyticity in the upper @xmath75 plane ) ; second , as shown in appendix c , it is directly connected with the retarded self - energy @xmath76 through @xmath77 and , finally , the position of its poles have well defined interpretations in terms of energies and thermalization rates . furthermore , the retarded propagator is the one that is naturally obtained from analytic continuation from the euclidean propagator in the imaginary - time formalism . for more details",

    "for instance in the low - temperature case , for momenta satisfying @xmath165 , the effective dispersion relation can be expanded as @xmath166 it is worth mentioning the difference between this expansion and that of eq .  .",
    "in a fundamental approach to the lorentz symmetry breaking one expects each additional power of momentum to be suppressed by increasing powers of the planck mass , whereas in the effective breaking approach we have pursued there are several energy scales .",
    "hence there is more freedom in the possible values of the suppression factor .",
    "for instance , in the low - temperature regime _i.e .",
    "_ , in eq .",
    " the @xmath167 term is suppressed by @xmath168 in planck units .",
    "the fact that in the latter approach there are more energy scales also explains why modifications to the @xmath169 term are present in eq .   while they are not included in eq .  .",
    "notice also that the corrections that we found only contain even powers of the momentum , and thus are in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present universe",
    "the effects we discussed are completely negligible when applied to electrons or protons , both because they are proportional to the planck length square and because they are exponentially suppressed .",
    "to obtain relevant effects , one should consider planckian temperatures .",
    "however , in this case perturbation theory around a flat - spacetime approximation probably fails .",
    "therefore the results obtained here should be considered an indication that effective violations of lorentz invariance indeed occur , and that gravitational interactions can not be neglected when exploring highly energetic regions of dispersion relations .    whereas the real part of the self - energy gives the change in energy of the particle and hence the dispersion relation , the imaginary part accounts for the dissipative effects and gives the thermalization rate .",
    "as we have already commented , at the order @xmath32 the imaginary part of the self - energy is zero .",
    "we do not see the thermalization effect since all processes which could contribute to it , such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut ] ( on the left ) , are kinematically forbidden . in order to account for thermalization effects",
    "we should compute the imaginary part of the self - energy to order @xmath170 . at this order , the particle can exchange momentum with the thermal bath through processes such as the one to the right of fig .  [",
