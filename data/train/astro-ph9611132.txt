    "the problem of the formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies has been one of the crucial topic over the last years ( see _ e.g. _ colafrancesco et al .",
    "1989 , kaiser 1993 , antonuccio - delogu 1992 , colafrancesco et al .",
    "1995 and ryden & gunn 1987 ) .",
    "it is well known that the formation of cosmic structures is strictly related to the evolution of the density perturbations : in the present _ paradigma _ of structure formation , it is generally assumed that cosmic structures of size @xmath7 r form preferentially around the local maxima of the primordial density field , once it is smoothed on the filtering scale @xmath5 .",
    "these linear density fluctuations eventually evolve towards the nonlinear regime under the action of gravitational instability ; they detach from the hubble flow at _ turn around _ epoch @xmath8 , given by : @xmath9^{1/2 } ( 1+z)^{3/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the mean background density , @xmath11 is the redshift and @xmath12 is the mean overdensity within the nonlinear region . after the _",
    "turn around _ epoch , the fluctuations start to recollapse when their overdensity reaches the value @xmath13 . since the density field depends on the matter that dominates the universe , the mean characteristics of the cosmic structures depend on the assumed model . in this context",
    "the most succesful model is the biased cold dark matter ( hereafter cdm ) ( see _ e.g. _ liddle @xmath14 lyth 1993 ) based on a scale invariant spectrum of density fluctuations growing under gravitational instability . in such scenario the formation of the structures occurs through a `` _ bottom up _ ''",
    "+ a simple model that describes the collapse of a perturbation of density is that of gunn & gott ( 1972 , hereafther gg72 ) .",
    "this is in contradiction with the predictions of cdm models .",
    "it is well known that in a cdm universe , an abundant production of substructures during the evolution of the fluctuations is predicted .",
    "the presence of substructure is very important for the dynamics of collapsing shells of baryonic matter made of galaxies and substructure of @xmath15 , falling into the central regions of a cluster of galaxies . in presence of substructure",
    "it is necessary to modify the equation of motion : @xmath16 since the graininess of mass distribution in the system induces dynamical friction that introduces a frictional force term . in a material system",
    ", the gravitational field can be decomposed into an average field , @xmath17 , generated from the smoothed out distribution of mass , and a stochastic component of the field , @xmath18 , generated from the fluctuations in number of the neighbouring particles .",
    "the stochastic component of the gravitational field is specified assigning a probability density , @xmath19 , ( chandrasekhar & von neumann 1942 , hereafter cvn42 ) . in an infinite homogeneous unclustered system @xmath19",
    "is given by the holtsmark distribution ( cvn42 ) whilst in inhomogeneous and clustered systems @xmath20 is given by kandrup ( 1980 ) and antonuccio - delogu & atrio - barandela ( 1992 , hereafter aa92 ) and respectively .",
    "the stochastic force , @xmath21 , in a self - gravitating system modifies the motion of particles as if it was a frictional force .",
    "in fact , a particle moving faster than its neighbours produces a deflection of their orbits in such a way that the average density is greater in the direction opposite to that of motion , causing a slowing down in its motion . adopting the notation of gg72",
    "( see also their eqs . 6 and 8) and remembering that @xmath22 is the collapse time in the absence of dynamical friction ( gg72 ) , one can write : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the critical density at a time @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the _ average density _",
    "inside @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "the equation of motion of a shell of baryonic matter in presence of dynamical friction , using the dimensionless time variable @xmath29 , can be written in the form : @xmath30 ( antonuccio - delogu & colafrancesco 1994 , hereafter ac94 ) where @xmath31 is the overdensity within @xmath27 and @xmath32 is the coefficient of dynamical friction .",
    "supposing that there are no correlations among random force and their derivatives , we have : @xmath33 ( kandrup 1980 ) , where @xmath34 is the average _ `` duration '' _ of a random force impulse of magnitude @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the probability distribution of stochastic force ( which for a clustered system is given in eq .",
    "37 of aa92 ) .",
    "in a previous paper ( del popolo & gambera 1996 , hereafter dpg96 ) , one of us showed how the expansion parameter @xmath37 depends on the dynamical friction , solving eq.([eq : p ] ) numerically .",
    "dpg96 assigned some values to @xmath32 and then solved eq.([eq : p ] ) through a numerical method not taking into account the parameters on which @xmath32 depends . in this paper",
    ", we examine how the dynamical friction coefficient @xmath32 varies according to the parameters and how the collapse time depends on them .",
    "we solved eq.([eq : q ] ) numerically and the other equations on which it depends for a outskirts shell of baryonic matter with @xmath38 inside the spherical regions ( protocluster ) , for different values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where :    * @xmath43 is the peaks height ; * @xmath44 is the filtering radius ; * @xmath45 is the parameter of the power - law density profile ; theoretical work ( ryden 1988 ) suggests that the density profile inside a protogalactic dark matter halo , before relaxation and baryonic infall , can be approximated by a power - law : @xmath46 where @xmath47 on a protogalactic scale .",
    "* @xmath48 is the product @xmath49 where @xmath2 is the total number of peaks inside a protocluster and @xmath50 is the correlation function calculated in @xmath4 . aa92",
    "have demonstrated that in the hypothesis @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the average mass of the subpeaks , the dependence of the dynamical friction coefficient on @xmath2 and @xmath53 may be expressed as a dependence on a single parameter that we define as : @xmath54    after having determinated @xmath32 solving numerically eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) , we get @xmath55 as a function of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 solving eq.([eq : p ] ) .",
    "we perform these calculations for different set of values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; the results are shown in figs .",
    "@xmath56 . before commenting upon the figures , we want to remark that the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath57 is qualitatively shown in fig . 5 of ac94 .",
    "we observe that for @xmath58 the collapse time in presence of dynamical friction is always larger than in the imperturbated case but the magnitude of the deviation is negligible for larger @xmath57 , whilst for @xmath59 the deviations increase steeply with lower @xmath57 .",
    "then , having considered @xmath38 , the estimation we get for @xmath55 in  4 must be considered as a lower limit .    in figure 1",
    "we show the collapse time in presence of dynamical friction , versus the peaks height , for different values of @xmath42 . in this picture , we show how @xmath55 grows for larger values of @xmath39 and for larger values of @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , in fig .",
    "2 we note how @xmath55 increases for larger values of @xmath39 and of @xmath60 .",
    "the slope of the curves confirm our prevision on the behaviour of the collapse of a shell of baryonic matter falling into the central regions of a cluster of galaxies in the presence of dynamical friction : the dynamical friction slows down the collapse ( as dpg96 had already shown ) and the effect , as we are showing in figs .",
    "1 and 2 , increases as @xmath61 , @xmath40 , @xmath62 grow . here",
    "we want to remind that we are considering only the peaks of the local density field with central height @xmath63 larger than a critical threshold @xmath39 .",
    "this latter quantity is chosen to be the threshold at which @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath64 is the typical size of the peaks and @xmath67 is the average peak separation ( see also bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) . +    in figs . 3 and 4",
    "we show how the collapse time varies with the core radius of the protocluster @xmath68 .",
    "note how @xmath55 grows as @xmath68 decreases : the smaller the core of the protocluster , the larger the time of collapse in the presence of dynamical friction ; besides we show how this effect increases for larger values of both @xmath39 and @xmath42 .",
    "in the first part of this work we have shown how the collapse time @xmath55 of a shell of baryonic matter made of galaxies and substructure depends on some parameters . in figures 1 and 2",
    "we can see how @xmath55 grows when @xmath42 or @xmath60 or @xmath69 increases .",
    "it means that the effects of the presence of the dynamical friction should be more evident in the outer regions of rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "besides , we show how the collapse time of an infalling shell increases with decreasing values of @xmath68 , and becomes very large for @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "then the slowing down of the collapse of an outer shell , of baryonic matter , within a cluster of galaxies owing to the dynamical friction is more remarkable in the clusters with core of little dimension .",
