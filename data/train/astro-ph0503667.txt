    "the powerful diffraction grating instruments on board _ chandra _ @xcite and _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite have enabled the observation of k - shell x - ray absorption lines of the ionized plasma surrounding active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "absorption features attributed to various ionization stages of oxgygen ranging from neutral to as high as have been seen , for example , in ngc 5548 , ngc 3783 , ngc 4593 , and ngc 7469 @xcite .",
    "these new k - shell x - ray absorption measurements complement those in the ultraviolet band ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one important physical property that can be derived from such measurements is the outflow velocity , which is based on the shift of a given line from its wavelength at rest .",
    "clearly , the accuracy of this procedure depends strongly on the accuracy with which the rest frame wavelength is known @xcite .",
    "calculations offer only limited guidance , as calculations have a rather high uncertainty .",
    "a comparison showed that k - shell x - ray line positions of and calculated by several authors differ by as much as 60  m and 80  m , respectively @xcite .",
    "these differences correspond to uncertainties between 800 and 1100  km  s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the spread in the calculated rest frame wavelengths is thus significantly larger than the wavelength shift expected for typical outflow velocities , making most theoretical values nearly useless as rest frame reference standards for a given line . because of the difficulty of accurately predicting electron - electron correlations , the uncertainty is expected to increase further for calculations of the k - shell x - ray lines of the lower charge states of oxygen . only laboratory measurements can establish the rest frame wavelengths of a given line and provide an associated uncertainty estimate .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a laboratory measurement of the rest frame wavelengths of the k - shell x - ray resonance lines in and .",
    "the experimental precision was sufficient to determine flow velocities to within 20  40  km  s@xmath0 , exceeding the typical measurement accuracy of any current astrophysical x - ray instrument .",
    "these measurements were conducted by emission spectroscopy in the interaction of oxygen ions with electrons of sufficient energy to excite the respective k - shell transition . because the energy needed to excite a k - shell transition is significantly larger than the energy required to ionize all but heliumlike and hydrogenlike oxygen , the measurements had to be performed in a non - equilibrium , ionizing plasma .    here we report on measurements of k - shell x - ray lines from charge states of oxygen as low as .",
    "these measurements again utilize emission spectroscopy of oxygen ions excited by high - energy electrons in a non - equilibrium , ionizing plasma .",
    "the lines observed under such conditions may be similar to those observed in a photoionized spectrum , where ionization by an electron is replaced by ionization by x rays .",
    "the interpretation of non - equilibrium , ionizing plasmas is difficult .",
    "this has recently been shown in various analyses of k - shell iron spectra @xcite .",
    "difficulties arise ( 1 ) because the wavelengths of the lines are not well known so that the line assignment may be uncertain when clusters of lines are involved and ( 2 ) because the excitation processes may be complex , involving an interplay of various processes that are often not fully modeled ( if at all ) , e.g. , inner - shell ionization , inner - shell excitation , autoionization , and radiative cascades .    in the simplest case ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate all excitation , radiative , and autoionization rates affecting a given charge state .",
    "because levels in two neighboring charge states are involved in the formation of spectra due to the presence of autoionization transitions , we denote this model as a `` two - ion '' model .",
    "this model is insufficient to predict the emission in an ionizing plasma where , for example , inner - shell ionization of the neighboring , lower charge state can produce an excited state that in turn contributes to the observed spectrum when undergoing radiative decay .",
    "a complex  three - ion \" model is typically used to describe the emission from plasmas in which significant ionization and recombination processes take place .",
    "such a model was used , for example , by @xcite to examine the effect of ionization of and the recombination from on the x - ray emission .",
    "we show that the three - ion model is also insufficient to describe the k - shell oxygen emission observed in our ionizing plasma . in order to describe our observations , we present an  all - ion \" model . in this model ,",
    "the emission of a given ion is coupled to more than just its nearest neighbors .",
    "only this model is found to be able to satisfactorily reproduce the observed oxygen k - shell emission .",
    "the combination of the laboratory data and the all - ion model allows us to identify lines from , , , and that , to the best of our knowledge , have not yet been measured before .",
    "although many features are likely to be blends of several lines , the features are sufficiently narrow so that we can readily assign wavelengths with small uncertainties .",
    "in addition to aiding the identification of lines in absorption spectra , the measured line positions are useful for establishing the quality of wavelength computations and as empirical input for optimizing calculational schemes , such as those carried out recently by @xcite .",
    "the measurement was performed at the university of california lawrence livermore national laboratory using the ebit - i electron beam ion trap .",
    "the device has been used for laboratory astrophysics measurements for over a decade @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission of ebit - i was detected by a high - resolution grazing incidence spectrometer @xcite with an angle of incidence of 88.5@xmath1 .",
    "the spectrometer features a variable line - spaced reflective grating with an average line spacing of 2400  grooves / mm and a radius of curvature of 44.3  m. the spectral image of the ion cloud in the ion trap is nearly flat and permits the use of a two - dimensional charge - coupled device ( ccd ) as a multichannel detector .",
    "the detector is cooled by liquid nitrogen and employs a 27  mm  @xmath2  26  mm , thinned , back - illuminated ccd chip with 1340  @xmath2  1300 pixels of 20  @xmath3 m @xmath2 20  @xmath3 m nominal size ; the quantum efficiency is about 45% at 22   . in the present setting the detector spans a wavelength interval about 7   wide , which is ample to cover the present 21 - 24   range of interest .",
    "the resolving power of this setup , drawn from the measured spectra , is about 1100 .",
    "oxygen was introduced to the electron beam ion trap by injection of carbon dioxide .",
    "this option provided _ in situ _ calibration lines in form of helium - like oxygen ( ) as well as hydrogen - like carbon ( ) .",
    "we observed the resonance , intercombination , and forbidden lines of , denoted @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively , following the labeling convention introduced by @xcite .",
    "the wavelengths of these lines are well known from the calculations of @xcite and some also from measurements by @xcite .",
    "we also observed the lyman series in the hydrogen - like spectrum of , @xmath7 through @xmath8 , for which @xcite provide calculated wavelengths .",
    "all these calibration line wavelengths are presumed to be accurate to better than 1  m .",
    "figure  [ fig : mspec ] shows features from 21.723.5   .",
    "ten superimposed spectra , each with 120 min exposure time , show the reproducibility of weak emission features .",
    "the black trace in figure  [ fig : spec ] represents the sum of the ten spectra in the wavelength range of 21.4  23.2   , from 20  h of total observation time .",
    "each of the ten spectra was individually filtered against cosmic ray events , calibrated , and analyzed .",
    "the reproducibility of these ten measurements was used to assess statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the measured spectrum in figure  [ fig : spec ] is dominated by the he - like lines @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we also readily identify the li - like line pair @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these constitute the four strongest lines seen in the spectrum .",
    "in addition , the spectrum contains nine features , labeled @xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "these satellite lines belong to charge states between and .",
    "they are situated at the long - wavelength side of the spectrum , and their intensities are considerably weaker than those of the lines .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the upper levels of these transitions have high autoionization rates , and therefore small radiative branching ratios .",
    "another reason lies in the ionization balance ; at the electron energies that are needed to excite k - shell lines , the charge state distribution strongly favors , leaving only a small fraction of and a minute abundance of and lower charge states ( and ) .",
    "in fact , the ionization potential of and is about 114  ev and 77  ev , respectively , while for technical reasons we used an electron beam energy of 4  kev .",
    "we therefore continually supplied neutral oxygen and then detected the different charge states lines ( through ) during the ionizing phase , before the ionization equilibrium was reached .",
    "this procedure is similar to that used in earlier measurements of the k - shell emission of low charge state ions of iron @xcite .",
    "the wavelengths of all features , @xmath11 ",
    "@xmath12 , are determined relative to the reference lines from and , and are tabulated in table  [ tab : id ] .",
    "the uncertainty of the reference lines includes two contributions , one from the errors of their observed positions and the other from their wavelength errors .",
    "the uncertainty of reference line positions was added in quadrature to the uncertainty of the line positions of the measured line features .",
    "the uncertainty of the reference line wavelengths , which is assumed to be less than 1  m , was added linearly .",
    "the overall wavelength uncertainty ranges from 2 to 4  m for line features @xmath13  @xmath14 and @xmath12 , and about 10  15  m for @xmath11 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is not trivial to unambiguously identify the emission features @xmath11  @xmath12 with specific transitions in various oxygen ions . after examining several theoretical models , we find that only a complex multi - ion model including major collisional and radiative processes is able to account for all line features . in the following",
    "we explain the details of these theoretical models , and the most likely identifications of the observed emission lines .",
    "the modeling of k - shell emission spectra of l - shell ions under the ebit - i plasma conditions requires the inclusion of various atomic processes , such as electron collisional excitation , radiative decay , autoionization , and direct electron collisional ionization . with the present beam energy , recombination processes are generally insignificant in populating the excited levels .",
    "because no external radiation field is present in ebit , we do not include photoionization process in the model .",
    "the flexible atomic code ( fac ) is used in the present analysis for the basic atomic parameters .",
    "fac is a relativistic configuration interaction atomic code , and uses the distorted - wave approximation to treat electron - ion collision processes @xcite .    with the given non - equilibrium charge balance for o ions , inner - shell direct electron collisional ionization",
    "is expected to be a major process in forming the k - shell lines in addition to the collisional excitation . moreover , with an electron density of @xmath17  @xmath18 provided by the electron beam current of 120  ma in ebit - i , many levels in the @xmath19 configurations are significantly populated , and inner - shell excitation as well as ionization from these excited states also play important roles in forming the observed spectrum . to illustrate these effects ,",
    "we have constructed three theoretical collisional - radiative models with increasing sophistication , which we denote as two - ion , three - ion , and all - ion models . the electron density used in these models , @xmath20  @xmath18 ,",
    "is determined by matching the observed line ratio @xmath21 , which is density sensitive , to the theoretical result of the all - ion model . in all three models ,",
    "we only consider the atomic states belonging to the @xmath19 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) configuration complexes for each ion . in the calculation of atomic data , configuration interaction within the same complex",
    "is included .    in the two - ion model",
    ", we ignore the direct electron collisional ionization processes , and only include collisional excitation followed by radiative cascades and autoionization transitions into the next higher charge state .",
    "therefore , only levels of two neighboring charge states are involved in determining the spectrum of a particular ion .",
    "the emission lines from  are calculated separately , with the fractional abundance of each charge state adjusted to match the brightest lines observed .",
    "the result of this model is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the relative abundances of  ions are 0.36 , 0.42 , 1.44 , 0.77 , 1.00 , respectively . with this model ,",
    "it is clear that the intensities of lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the line features labeled as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 can not be explained .",
    "feature @xmath13 is attributed to the line @xmath27 , and features @xmath28 and @xmath12 are attributed to the and lines , respectively .",
    "features @xmath11 and @xmath15 do not seem to belong to the kll satellite transitions , and their nature is discussed later in this section .",
    "the failure of this model is due to the lack of ionization processes that make contributions to certain lines .    in the three - ion model",
    ", we add the next lower charge state to the modeling of the spectrum of a particular ion , and therefore we include the inner - shell electron collisional ionization processes forming k - shell lines in addition to the collisional excitation and autoionization",
    ". however , the spectral contributions from individual ions are again treated in separate calculations , with the fractional abundance of each charge state adjusted to match the brightest lines , which are the same as those used in the two - ion model , except that one more ion , with a fractional abundance of 0.12 is added to the spectral model of .",
    "the result of this model is shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the three - ion model represents a significant improvement over the two - ion model .",
    "the lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the line features d and f are now accounted for satisfactorily .",
    "however , feature @xmath16 , which is attributed to the lines @xmath29 and @xmath30 , is now overpredicted .",
    "lines @xmath29 and @xmath30 are mainly produced by the ionization of , whose abundance is fixed by matching the @xmath31 line , which is mainly produced by collisional excitation , to the line feature @xmath13",
    ". therefore the ratio of ( @xmath32)/@xmath27 in this model does not depend on the relative abundances of the and ions , and is in disagreement with the observed spectrum .",
    "moreover , the observed line feature @xmath14 can not be explained satisfactorily in this model . it can be tentatively attributed to the lines in its vicinity , which are mainly due to the ionization of ions .",
    "however , the ionization of ions also contributes to the intensity of line feature @xmath12 , and with the chosen abundance of 0.12 for , line @xmath12 is already overpredicted , while the lines in the vicinity of @xmath14 are not nearly strong enough to account for its intensity .",
    "the problems with the three - ion model arise from the fact that only levels in three adjacent charge states are allowed to influence the spectrum of the ion .",
    "for example , when calculating the spectrum of , only levels in , , and enter the model . at very low electron densities , where only the ground state of each charge state is significantly populated ,",
    "this is a good approximation . at the present electron density ,",
    "many states in the @xmath19 configurations have large populations relative to the ground state .",
    "the ionization of these excited states has an important role in populating the excited states of the next higher charge state , which in turn makes significant contributions to the k - shell lines of even higher charge states . in the example of , therefore , all ions having lower charge than can indirectly influence the level population of through successive ionization . with a three - ion model ,",
    "such indirect effects are lost . in order to address such far - reaching line formation processes ,",
    "we have constructed an all - ion model , which includes ",
    "charge states in a single collisional radiative model .",
    "the relative abundances of  are adjusted to be 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.36 , 0.77 , and 1.00 , respectively , in order to match the brightest lines in the observed spectrum .",
    "the small abundances of and are required by the lack of any significant lines at wavelengths longer than 23.2  ( see figure  [ fig : mspec ] ) .",
    "the result of this model is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "unlike the two and three - ion models , this model clearly accounts for all major emission lines in the observed spectrum .",
    "an interesting fact is that now line feature @xmath13 is mainly attributed to the lines @xmath33 and @xmath34 instead of @xmath27 , and feature @xmath14 is attributed to lines , both of which arise due to the step - wise ionization processes from the lower charge states .",
    "the observed spectrum also shows two significant features , @xmath11 and @xmath15 , on the long wavelength shoulder of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 lines .",
    "the theoretical models indicate that all @xmath35 transitions of , notably , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , are too weak to explain them , and no lines from lower charge states appear in this region",
    ". however , the models do give several lines resulting from the @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) transitions in the vicinity of this region , and they have intensities comparable to those observed .",
    "these lines are mainly produced by the inner - shell excitation of the ground state , and are enabled only through configuration interaction effects , since the radiative decay involves two - electron transitions .",
    "however , due to the difficulties in calculating the radiative and autoionization rates associated with these levels , the confidence in these identifications is somewhat limited .    in table",
    "[ tab : id ] , we list possible line identifications of all significant features from  in the observed spectrum .",
    "all of these features consist of multiple closely spaced lines , and the theoretical relative intensities of individual lines are given according to the all - ion model .",
    "we also compare the measured wavelengths with various theoretical calculations and astrophysical observations , wherever available . in the present calculation ,",
    "wavelengths are obtained with the configuration interaction ( ci ) method for all ions , and with a combined ci and second - order many - body perturbation theory method ( mbpt ) for the kll transitions of and @xcite .",
    "a second - order mbpt calculation is found to have no improvements over the ci method for charge states lower than , and therefore the corresponding results are not shown .",
    "for and , the mbpt correction does seem to improve the theoretical wavelengths significantly .",
    "based on the identifications presented in the previous section , we assign measured wavelengths and associated uncertainties to one or two strongest lines in each blended feature , as listed in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "the uncertainties not only reflect the measurement errors , but also take into account the fact that each observed feature contains contributions from weaker lines .",
    "one result of this modeling effort is the recognition that what we had taken to represent line @xmath27 of at 22.374(3 )   @xcite is now seen as a contribution to a line blend that is dominated by the satellite lines @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the line blend has the small wavelength uncertainty determined previously @xcite .",
    "the individual , unresolved line constituents now have to be assigned larger errors .",
    "as we do not see any distortion of the joint line profile from the instrumental profile , line @xmath27 may be assumed to lie within the half width of the line , giving it a line position uncertainty of about 30  m , or ten times more than that of the full line . by comparing the model calculations with the observed spectra",
    ", we notice that our new mbpt wavelenghts for other and lines agree very well with the measured values .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that the mbpt wavelength for line @xmath31 is reliable to within 10  m , and we assign it a wavelength of 22.370(10 )   .",
    "this uncertainty of 10  m is about three times larger than previously assumed , but still significantly better than that of _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the uncertainty corresponds to outflow velocity uncertainties of about 130  km  s@xmath0 and is comparable or better than the measurement uncertainty of any current astrophysical measurement .    line feature @xmath25 is mainly comprised of six transitions with lower and upper configurations of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "of these six lines , the @xmath44 transition is the strongest with roughly 40% of the total intensity .",
    "all six transitions have theoretical wavelengths within 4  m of each other .",
    "based on the representative wavelength measurement of the complex , we assign an uncertainty of 8  m to the lines in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "feature @xmath28 has two dominant components with 80% of the total intensity .",
    "the two transitions have similar theoretical wavelengths .",
    "we therefore expect the measured wavelength to be an accurate representation of these two transitions , and we assign a small uncertainty of 5  m to them .",
    "feature @xmath26 is almost entirely due to two transitions between @xmath45(@xmath46,@xmath47 ) and @xmath48(@xmath47 ) states .",
    "the two transitions have very close theoretical wavelengths , thereofore , we assign the measured wavelength to this blended feature with a small uncertainty .",
    "feature @xmath14 is mainly due to the transition @xmath42(2 ) ",
    "@xmath43(2 ) with 75% of the total intensity .",
    "the remaining blending have the calculated wavelengths very close to the main component .",
    "accordingly , a small uncertainty is assigned to the main component .",
    "feature @xmath16 is mainly due to the line pair @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "however , this feature is quite weak and broad . the calculated intensity of @xmath29 and @xmath30 does not agree with the observed intensity as well as other features do .",
    "it is possible that many weak transitions from other charge states contribute to this feature .",
    "we therefore assign a relatively large uncertainty of 20  m to this line pair .",
    "the major component of feature @xmath12 is the blend of the lines @xmath49(1,2 ) ",
    "@xmath50(1 ) with 70% of the total intensity , and having nearly identical theoretical wavelengths .",
    "we therefore assign the measured wavelength of this feature as belonging to these two transitions , with a small uncertainty of 6  m .",
    "the wavelengths determined for these transitions in the present work are all significantly better than what is achievable with _ ab initio _ calculations , and are better than or at least comparable to the accuracy of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ grating instruments .",
    "our data provide reliable reference lines for outflow velocity measurements in the absorption spectroscopy of agns and x - ray binaries .",
