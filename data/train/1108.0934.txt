    "galaxy clusters have long been known as radio synchrotron sources . given",
    "that observations show that the intracluster medium is typically magnetized at the @xmath2@xmath3 level ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , what is required for the radio emission is a nonthermal population of accelerated electrons . arguments for various scenarios responsible for cluster radio emission therefore hinge on the method of particle acceleration , using the observed radio and x - ray properties of galaxy clusters as discriminatory evidence .",
    "radio properties of the sources in galaxy clusters vary , though in general the types of sources can be separated into two basic categories , sources associated with individual galaxies and those associated with the diffuse intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "those associated to individual galaxies include the jet and lobe sources connected to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the diffuse sources can be further divided into two broad classes , radio relics and radio halos .",
    "radio relics include both steep spectrum re - energized agn jet lobes , as well as polarized sources likely associated with recently accelerated cosmic - ray ( cr ) electrons at merger shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these extended , elongated features are steep spectrum sources with curved shapes , spatially distinct and strongly argued as coincident with shocks from both observations and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "radio halos ( rhs ) , by contrast , are mpc - scale , diffuse , unpolarized , steep spectrum radio emitting regions typically centered on the x - ray center of the icm , with a spatial distribution similar to the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the origin of rhs is less certain than the radio relics , though it was recognized a decade ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observational evidence now continues to suggest that they are associated with merging clusters @xcite .",
    "for example , the recent work of @xcite uses radio observations ( with gmrt ) and _ chandra _ observations of an x - ray selected sample of galaxy clusters to make a strong case for a division in the observed x - ray morphological properties of rh and non - rh galaxy clusters . in brief , clusters that are more disturbed in the x - ray power ratios , centroid shift measures and have lower concentration parameters are those that tend to host radio halos . those with relaxed structure measures and higher concentrations tend to not have detectable large - scale radio emission .    recent observational and simulation work argues that rhs are created through merger - induced turbulent re - acceleration of an existing population of crs in the icm . the argument for turbulent re - acceleration of a pre - existing cr electron population as the cause of rhs appeals to a combination of observational properties .",
    "first , the radio emission is broadly distributed over a relatively large volume , roughly centered on the x - ray centroid of the cluster , and more or less spatially uniform ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "given the short synchrotron lifetimes of the cr electrons responsible for the emission , they must be accelerated _ in situ _ , ruling out acceleration from large individual shock structures on morphological grounds @xcite .",
    "turbulence provides a source of energy that is distributed relatively evenly over the cluster volume .",
    "second , this model naturally explains the connection of the presence of rhs to cluster mergers .",
    "though second order fermi processes are usually invoked @xcite , there are legitimate questions about the exact method by which the turbulent energy can be converted into accelerated particles .",
    "in addition , a key prediction of the turbulent re - acceleration model is the expected presence of very steep spectrum rhs ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "two recent rhs have been found to host so called ultra steep spectrum radio halos , a521 @xcite and a697 @xcite .",
    "these discoveries , though small in number so far , fit the turbulent re - acceleration model .",
    "another explanation proposed for the origin of rhs is hadronic production .",
    "this model invokes the production of secondary relativistic electrons generated by the collisions of relativistic protons and the thermal population of atomic nuclei in the icm . in the hadronic scenario ,",
    "the secondary electrons are responsible for the observed radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the proponents argue that the hadronic model more naturally explains the correlation of the radio emission with the x - ray emitting icm ( i.e. the target population for p - p collisions ) and the presence of both rhs and radio relics in clusters .",
    "merger induced enhancement of cluster magnetic fields is invoked to explain the rh - merger connection @xcite .",
    "however , recent @xmath5-ray upper limits from _ fermi _ observations of galaxy clusters are beginning to constrain the capability of hadronic models to account for rhs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the hadronic processes should also generate @xmath5-rays from neutral pion decay .",
    "the recent discovery of ultra steep spectrum radio sources described above is also not predicted in the hadronic scenario given the energetic considerations required by the @xmath5-ray upper limits .",
    "these and other constraints suggested by observations of rhs , such as the spectral and spatial properties of the radio emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , argue against the hadronic model .",
    "one more piece of observational evidence in the case of radio halos is the relationship between the bulk x - ray and radio properties of massive galaxy clusters .",
    "the radio luminosity at 1.4@xmath6 and the x - ray luminosity of massive radio halo galaxy clusters exhibit a strong correlation for many objects .",
    "however , there apparently exists a bimodal distribution in the @xmath7 plane , where many clusters have no radio detections , only upper limits in @xmath8 that lie well below the scaling relation .",
    "these objects are of similar mass and x - ray luminosity to those that clearly host radio halos and are on the scaling relation .",
    "there is a significant gap between the measured radio luminosity of the rhs and the upper limits of the non - rh objects , which suggests that the transition between the two phases ( radio halo versus non - rh ) must be relatively quick @xcite . while there were initial concerns that the bimodality of the @xmath7 relation might be an artifact of selection effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the depth of the radio data for the current samples appears to address that issue .",
    "the presence of a strong correlation of radio power with x - ray luminosity for rh clusters , the bimodality of the relation , and the inferred lifetime and transition times for rhs have been used to argue for or against models of radio halo production ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this case , numerical simulations provide a window into the evolution of the relevant physical properties of the icm .    in this paper , we study the evolution over time of massive clusters formed within a cosmological volume simulation , which allows us to track cluster mergers , the evolution of cluster structure , and the presence and evolution of turbulence . using simulations",
    ", we can investigate the frequency and timescale over which clusters exhibit elevated levels of turbulence and x - ray structures similar to those observed for rh clusters .",
    "the use of cosmological simulations turns out to be critical to accurately capture cluster merger histories .",
    "in particular , we attempt to understand the connection between the x - ray morphology of galaxy clusters and the putative energy source for cr acceleration in the icm : turbulence .",
    "we do not attempt to determine the method of particle acceleration , we merely discuss the probability of the turbulent re - acceleration model of rhs given the correlations between the physical properties of the simulated clusters and their observed morphological characteristics .",
    "we study both the `` snapshot '' correlations for our clusters between the x - ray structure measures ( power ratios and centroid shifts ) and the turbulence kinetic energy and the time evolution of these properties .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes the methodology of the analysis we undertake , including the details of the numerical simulations and analysis and the method of calculating the x - ray structure measures from the synthetic observations .",
    "section 3 describes the distribution of simulated galaxy cluster structures compared to observations , the time evolution of both the structure measures and turbulence kinetic energy , and compares how the turbulence kinetic energy correlates with the observed properties of radio halo clusters .",
    "section 4 gives estimates for lifetimes and duty cycles for radio halos based on the typical duration of episodes of elevated turbulence kinetic energy and the fraction of clusters in these states .",
    "section 5 summarizes and discusses the implications of our results .",
    "for this study we use a numerical cosmological hydrodynamic / n - body simulation generated using the ` enzo ` code , a publicly available adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) cosmology code developed by greg bryan and colleagues @xcite .",
    "the specifics of the enzo code are described in detail in these papers ( and references therein ) .",
    "this simulation is set up as follows .",
    "we initialize our calculation at @xmath9 assuming a cosmological model with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) , @xmath14 , and using an @xcite power spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath15 .",
    "the simulation is of a volume of the universe 128  h@xmath16  mpc ( comoving ) on a side with a @xmath17 root grid .",
    "the dark matter particle mass is @xmath18  h@xmath16  m@xmath19 .",
    "the simulation was then evolved to @xmath20 with a maximum of @xmath21 levels of adaptive mesh refinement ( a maximum spatial resolution of @xmath22  h@xmath16 comoving kpc ) , refining on dark matter and baryon overdensities of @xmath23 .",
    "this simulation includes a prescription for radiative cooling of the gas using non - equilibrium cooling and chemistry for h and he , and a spatially uniform but time - varying haardt - madau ultraviolet radiation background . in this case , we have not included metal line cooling as has been done in previous calculations , since in this study we are interested in the morphological properties of the clusters .",
    "many investigators have documented the over - cooling problems associated with including metal cooling in cosmological simulations , and in previous work we have shown that this over - cooling leads to a severe mismatch of structure measures between the observed and simulated cluster images .",
    "we perform all our post - processing analysis for this work using the ` yt ` analysis toolkit @xcite . for each of 132 simulation outputs equally spaced in time ( @xmath24 = 0.055 gyr ) in the redshift interval 0 @xmath250.9",
    ", we ran the hop halo - finding algorithm @xcite on the dark matter particle distribution to produce a dark matter halo catalog . for each halo catalog in each time interval , we create spherically averaged radial profiles of a set of physical properties ( including density and mass ) to calculate the value of @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the identified halos .",
    "@xmath27 refers to the total mass inside a radius of @xmath26 , the radius at which the overdensity average inside the sphere centered on the cluster is 200 times the critical density .",
    "we then took all the halos at @xmath28=0 with @xmath29 ( a relatively arbitrary cutoff ) as our sample .",
    "we choose the high mass objects so that we can make a reasonable comparison to the very high mass objects of @xcite , and to limit our sample to the best resolved objects in the simulation .",
    "this cut results in a sample at @xmath28=0 of 16 galaxy clusters .    following the identification of the sample",
    ", we generated a set of synthetic 0.3 - 8.0 kev x - ray images of each cluster generated from the ` cloudy ` software @xcite .",
    "we then make a corresponding image of each of these clusters from each of the 132 time outputs described above .",
    "each initial image represents a projected area of 8 by 8 mpc around each cluster in order to study both the cluster and the surrounding structures .",
    "the x - ray images are output in fits format with the correct angular scale for their redshift , and with the flux modified by the distance .",
    "therefore , we are left with a series of synthetic x - ray surface brightness images that we can analyze in a similar way to observed images of galaxy clusters .",
    "each series represents a time history of each of our 16 clusters .",
    "additionally , we have calculated the bulk properties of each cluster and its most massive predecessors throughout this time history .",
    "the association of radio halos with clusters undergoing mergers , known visually for quite some time , has been established quantitatively through the presence of significant substructure or disturbed cluster structure in the x - ray surface brightness distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite use three structure measures based on x - ray images of the clusters in their sample : the centroid shift @xmath30 , the third order power ratio @xmath31 , and the concentration @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite show that giant radio halo clusters can be efficiently separated from non - radio halo clusters and radio mini - halos in the plane defined by any two of these structure measures ( i.e. @xmath30 vs. @xmath31 , @xmath32 vs. @xmath30 , or @xmath32 vs. @xmath31 ) .    here",
    "we will employ the former two statistics , the centroid shift and @xmath31 , the calculations of which have been discussed in detail in previous papers @xcite . in brief , the centroid shift measures the variation ( here standard deviation ) of the position of the centroid of the x - ray surface brightness of a cluster relative to the x - ray peak in apertures of increasing radius , and w is normalized relative to the largest aperture considered .",
    "the power ratios are based on the multipole moments of the x - ray surface brightness in an aperture of a given size ; specifically they are proportional to the sum of the squares of the moments divided by the total cluster flux @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 is the third order power ratio and is sensitive to deviations from mirror symmetry . for consistency with @xcite",
    ", we employ the same overall aperture size of 500 kpc for both @xmath30 and @xmath31 as well as the same aperture spacing of 25 kpc for the centroid shift ( see for example equations 1 - 5 in @xcite ) . in the case of the centroid shift ,",
    "we remove the central 50 kpc surrounding the x - ray peak from consideration .",
    "the centroid shift @xmath30 and the power ratios within an aperture of 500 kpc are calculated for every time output over the history of our 16 simulated clusters .",
    "we do not use the concentration parameter , which is defined by @xcite as the ratio of the x - ray surface brightness within the central 100 kpc to the surface brightness within 500 kpc . with this definition ,",
    "the typical cluster concentration evolves significantly with redshift as a fixed 100 kpc aperture encloses more or less of the cluster volume .",
    "this evolution makes a fixed cut for relaxed or disturbed clusters impossible .",
    "a different definition of concentration based on overdensity radii would provide a better criterion for clusters spanning a large redshift range but would not allow a direct comparison to the observed radio halo sample of @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that in the redshift range spanned by the @xcite sample , we find a similar median concentration for our simulated clusters to that of the observed clusters once the x - ray peak is removed ( as was done for the centroid shifts ) .      to evaluate the connection between the morphological structure measures and the physical state of the cluster",
    ", we have made a calculation of the mass - averaged turbulence kinetic energy ( tke ) for each cluster inside the same radius ( 500 kpc ) that we have calculated the structure measures .",
    "here we use a common definition of the turbulence kinetic energy density ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the orthogonal components of the peculiar velocity of the gas in each grid zone ( subtracting the bulk halo velocity ) , and @xmath0 is the specific kinetic energy .",
    "the bulk halo velocity is calculated as the mass - weighted average velocity of all dark matter particles identified by the halo finding algorithm as halo members . for our analysis",
    "we calculate a mass - averaged value of @xmath0 in a sphere with @xmath35=500 kpc around each cluster center .",
    "we note that we are not truly calculating the energy of the full turbulent cascade . we can calculate a physical reynolds number for flows of characteristic length scale equal to the minimum grid scale ( for grid elements at the peak spatial resolution ) of the simulation .",
    "our grid size at peak spatial resolution and the characteristic parameters of the icm flows can be combined into a dimensionless reynolds number @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fluid velocity , @xmath38 is a characteristic length , and @xmath39 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid . we can estimate the values for @xmath37 and @xmath38 to be roughly the sound speed @xmath40 and minimum grid scale .",
    "estimates of the viscosity are trickier , but the viscosity for a fully ionized unmagnetized thermal plasma @xcite can be written as @xmath41 for typical values of the icm temperature ( @xmath4210 kev ) and density and assuming a sound speed of @xmath40=1000 km / s , the reynolds number at our peak grid resolution is roughly @xmath43 . flows with these reynolds numbers are below the expected threshold for transition from laminar to turbulent flow in an ideal gas . additionally , for our simulations , the details of turbulent flow ( should it exist ) are not captured at our smallest grid scale or below .",
    "however , @xmath44 scales linearly with the characteristic length of the flow , and large scale eddies should be captured .",
    "we expect that turbulence injection in the icm happens at scales well above our grid size ( @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "what we do capture in this calculation is the kinetic energy associated with bulk random motions of the icm gas at and above the grid scale of the simulation .",
    "this motion would be converted to thermal energy through the turbulent cascade ( and through shock dissipation ) in the real icm .",
    "so this calculation is made to simply characterize the available energy in random bulk motion of the icm , which we assume will eventually be dissipated into heat ( and possibly crs ) through the turbulent cascade .",
    "indeed , recent work by @xcite indicates that our metric @xmath0 should be relatively insensitive to the spatial resolution of the simulation grid .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 is tracked with time in the history of each cluster to determine the change in the tke .",
    "if the paradigm that cluster radio halos are powered by turbulent re - acceleration of crs is correct , increases in the tke should lead to an increase in the radio brightness .",
    "therefore , we can make estimates of the lifetime of radio halos by tracking the tke evolution",
    ". we also study the correlation of the x - ray structure measures with the tke ; since the presence of a radio halo is observed to be linked to x - ray structure , the tke should likewise be correlated to cluster structure if indeed turbulence is connected to the production of radio halos .",
    "@xcite show that radio halo clusters can be distinguished from non - radio halo clusters based on their observed x - ray structure .",
    "in particular , in terms of the two structure measures we consider , @xcite find that clusters hosting radio halos tend to lie in the upper - right quadrant of the @xmath46 plane with high centroid shifts and high @xmath31 .",
    "below , we compare the distribution of clusters structures for our simulated clusters to observed clusters from the @xcite sample and show that they are similar .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the distribution of structures of our simulated clusters in the @xmath46 plane for all time outputs with @xmath47 , the redshift range spanned by the @xcite sample .",
    "@xcite make cuts for radio halo versus non - halo clusters based on the median of each structure measure , which for their sample gives @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "most of the radio halo clusters in their sample do in fact have @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for our simulated sample in a similar redshift range ( @xmath47 ) ,",
    "we find median values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , similar particularly for the centroid shift to the @xcite values .",
    "both the @xcite structure cuts ( red lines ) and the median values in the simulations ( black lines ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "we find that in the @xmath47 redshift range , @xmath54 of the simulated cluster images have structures above the @xcite cuts ( @xmath50 and @xmath55 ) while @xmath56 have structures above the median values for the simulated sample .",
    "overall there is a good match between the structure of clusters in our simulations and observed clusters in terms of both the typical cluster structure and range of structure measures .",
    "comparing figure 1 to figure 1 in @xcite gives the visual impression that a larger fraction of simulated clusters lie in the off - diagonal ( lower - right and upper - left ) regions of the structure plane implying a less strong correlation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in figure 1 , a total of @xmath57 ( depending on the cuts used ) of the simulated cluster images lie in the two off - diagonal quadrants compared to 5 out of 32 in the @xcite sample , not a significant difference given the sample size .    the fraction of simulated clusters in the upper - right quadrant of the @xmath46 plane , which have x - ray structures similar to those observed for radio halo clusters , is a good match to the @xmath58 of x - ray luminous clusters found to host radio halos in the survey of a complete cluster sample with the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) @xcite ( from which the @xcite sample is drawn ) and to the 12 out of 32 clusters hosting giant radio halos in the @xcite sample .",
    "if we consider instead the full redshift range of the simulations ( @xmath59 ) , we find that clusters have radio halo like structures @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) of the time given the @xcite ( simulated ) structure cuts . as we will show in later sections , some clusters spend most of their time in disturbed states while other clusters are relaxed over nearly all of their history .     versus @xmath31 plane for all the simulated cluster images in the redshift range @xmath47 ( the range in @xcite ) .",
    "red lines indicate the structure cuts from @xcite , black are the median values for our simulated clusters.,width=336 ]      we follow the evolution of both the structure measures and the tke for individual simulated clusters through time .",
    "this reveals a wide range of cluster histories .",
    "we investigate the effect of mergers on measured cluster structure ( i.e. the observable effects of mergers ) and on the tke .",
    "we can then ask when clusters have structure measures similar to those observed for radio halos and how this relates to the tke and merger history .",
    "the time histories of the tke in 6 of the simulated clusters in our sample are shown in figure [ all_ke_z ] .",
    "the clusters are chosen to represent a wide range of time histories .",
    "we use the kinetic energy density as defined earlier to remove the effect of increasing mass on the result . in each case , for the purposes of comparison with the structure measures , we only examine the value of @xmath0 inside a radius of 500 kpc .",
    "it is clear from these histories that the value of @xmath0 undergoes major variations as a function of time in each cluster .",
    "these variations can change the value by factors of 5 or more over time intervals of 0.5 - 1 gyr .",
    "the strong increases in the tke will be shown in later sections to correspond directly to the incidence of merging events .",
    "these merging events , as has been shown in previous investigations , also correspond to changes in the x - ray structure measures",
    ".        however , for the structure measures , the variations with time for individual clusters are not as smooth as those for the tke .",
    "figure [ p3_z ] shows the variation in the @xmath31 power ratio as a function of redshift for the same 6 simulated clusters shown in figure [ all_ke_z ] . while the tke rises and falls smoothly during merger events , the value of the x - ray @xmath31 power ratio jumps up and down significantly during the whole life of the cluster . from previous studies ,",
    "we were aware that the power ratios can vary significantly on short time scales .",
    "merger phase can have a strong effect on the structure measures .",
    "strong dips in @xmath31 are often seen , for example , at the moment of core passage in major mergers .",
    "the x - ray structure measures tend to be highest in the pre - merger and post - core passage re - expansion phases when subclusters are well - separated and/or asymmetric features are most prominent .",
    "statistically , x - ray structure measures like @xmath30 and @xmath31 correlate strongly with cluster dynamical state , but significant scatter is present for individual cluster measurements ( projection effects also contribute to the scatter ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , though a correlation between the turbulence kinetic energy and the x - ray structure measures is expected , it is not immediately obvious from individual cluster time histories that this is the case .        to further illuminate the effects of cluster mergers , in figures [ halo4_merg ] , [ halo14_merg ] , and [ halo13_merg ] we show three example mergers from our simulated cluster sample which exhibit quite varied merger progessions . during the mergers ,",
    "we have measured the value of both @xmath62 and @xmath31 , as well as the turbulence kinetic energy @xmath0 . in each figure , the images from left to right in both the upper and second row are a time series of x - ray surface brightness ( upper ) and x - ray weighted temperature ( second ) .",
    "the two plots in the second row from the bottom show the progression in time of the tke ( left ) and the position in the @xmath31-@xmath62 plane .",
    "the bottom panels show the evolution of the individual structure measures as a function of redshift .",
    "letters indicate the position in the time series . in figure [ halo4_merg ] , we see in panel a a subhalo approaching the main cluster ; in panel b , this subcluster is driving an obvious large shock into the gas .",
    "point b in the tke time series is associated with the peak of the enhancement , and also the structure measures have moved into the disturbed area of the @xmath31-@xmath62 plane . as the subcluster passes through the main cluster , the tke declines gradually , and the structure measures move back into the `` relaxed '' regions of the structure plot . between points b and c ,",
    "the structure measures show the typical progression seen in cluster mergers : both @xmath31 and @xmath62 show a peak near point b when the subcluster enters the 500 kpc aperture ; as the cluster undergoes core passage between points b and c , the structure measures both dip ; @xmath31 and @xmath62 then show a second peak following core passage in the re - expansion phase before declining again .",
    "point c is near the end of re - expansion and outgoing shocks can be seen in the temperature map .",
    "compared to the structure measures , the tke evolves smoothly throughout the merger . at point d",
    ", the small remaining core of the subcluster can been seen re - entering the cluster , but this more minor event does not lead to as large a rise in the structure measures or the tke .",
    "figure [ halo14_merg ] shows a slightly more complicated merger .",
    "first , we have two approaching subclusters ( seen in the upper center and upper right of panel a ) .",
    "the first merger drives a large shock , seen in the temperature image of panel b. this again leads to a spike in the tke and a movement of the structure measures in to the disturbed regime . before the cluster can relax , the second , apparently smaller subcluster plunges in , enhancing the tke again and again boosting the structure measures toward the disturbed regime ( point c ) .",
    "after an extended period , the tke declines and the structure measures move in to the relaxed quadrant of the @xmath63 plane ( point d ) .",
    "figure [ halo13_merg ] shows a very complex scenario . in panel a we see two subhalos in the center left of the image which are in the process of merging . in panel b , the subhalos have merged with each other and are in a re - expansion phase ( note the merger shock in the temperature image of panel a , and the outgoing shocks in b ) .",
    "they then pass by the main cluster on either side , with the leading shock sweeping over the main cluster .",
    "meanwhile , in panel c , note another approaching subcluster to the upper right , which by panel d has plunged into the main cluster .",
    "this multiple merger , as seen in the context of the tke and structure measures , has an increase in @xmath0 during both merger events , while the structure measures remain high throughout .",
    "this is a very dynamic environment , where multiple mergers take place throughout the cluster lifetime , leading to long periods of elevated tke and disturbed structure measures .        in general",
    ", we find that there is no `` typical '' cluster history .",
    "some clusters undergo complex mergers or progressions of successive mergers leading them to be disturbed over most of their history , while other clusters are nearly always relaxed , experiencing only one or two minor mergers from @xmath64 to the present .",
    "this diversity highlights the importance of using cosmological scale simulations , since idealized mergers would not capture the full complexity of cluster evolution .",
    "it is clear from the cluster histories that the tke can increase drastically during cluster mergers ( as you would expect ) and that clusters can display quite different tke evolutionary histories . in this section",
    ", we consider how the tke correlates with the observed properties of radio halo clusters and if this is consistent with the turbulent re - acceleration model of radio halo production .",
    "specifically , we examine the tke in clusters with and without x - ray structures consistent with those observed for radio halo clusters , and we look at the correlation between total tke and cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "one of the main relevant questions of our investigation is whether the presence of enhanced tke correlates with the value of the structure measures for the x - ray images .",
    "we show in figure [ all_wp3 ] the @xmath31-@xmath62 plane for each of the clusters shown in figure [ all_ke_z ] .",
    "each data point in these images represents one time interval from the simulated data for the cluster in question .",
    "the data points are colored by their relative tke , to indicate the level of turbulence at the time the structures are measured .",
    "the colors go from red ( @xmath65 ) to yellow ( @xmath66 ) , to green ( @xmath67 ) , to blue ( @xmath68 ) . in each case",
    ", @xmath69 represents the minimum value of @xmath0 over the full time interval for which the cluster and its predecessors have @xmath70 .",
    "using @xmath69 may lead to scatter in the results , however , it is not clear from any of the histories what the base value for @xmath0 should be . in many objects , increases in @xmath0 due to a new merger occur before @xmath0 has finished decreasing from prior mergers . certainly , by eye the visual effect of mergers lasts longer than the time between mergers for many of the objects .",
    "the resulting correlations vary from cluster to cluster , but in general , figure [ all_wp3 ] shows an obvious trend for more disturbed power ratios and centroid shifts to be accompanied by a higher tke state .",
    "we can quantify this result further by examining the correlation of cluster structure with the tke in a global sense across all the clusters .",
    "one key measurement is the amount of time spent in both an elevated tke state and in the upper right quadrant of the @xmath31 - @xmath62 plane .",
    "conversely , we can also check that the lower left quadrant of this plot is more likely to be populated by clusters with lower tke .",
    "figures [ highke_upperright ] and [ highke_lowerleft ] show the correlation between the turbulence kinetic energy and the location of the cluster s projected structure measures .",

    "while the origin of radio halos is still a matter of debate , it has been suggested that merger generated turbulence could accelerate a pre - existing relativistic electron population ( from supernovae , agn , previous merger / shock activity ) to energies sufficient to produce the radio emission .    in this paper",
    ", we study the evolution with time of massive clusters formed within a numerical hydrodynamic , cosmological simulation and investigate whether a subset of the x - ray and radio observational evidence from clusters is consistent with the turbulent re - acceleration model for radio halos . in particular , we track the evolution of random bulk icm motions , the kinetic energy of which is dissipated through shocks and the turbulent cascade .",
    "we study the relationship between turbulence kinetic energy and x - ray structure measures , how these evolve during mergers , and whether the level of turbulence in simulated clusters with radio halo - like cluster structures supports the turbulent re - acceleration model .",
    "we show that the distribution of the x - ray structure measures ( centroid shift @xmath30 and third order power ratio @xmath31 ) used by @xcite to separate radio halo and non - radio halo clusters are reproduced fairly well in our simulated cluster sample and that a similar fraction of simulated clusters have `` disturbed '' x - ray structures compared to observations .",

    "both @xmath31 and @xmath98 are noisier than @xmath0 as a function of time in our simulated clusters .",
    "a classic example in many of our simulated clusters is the sharp reduction in the values of the structure measures as a merger proceeds through the core passage of a subcluster .",
    "though the turbulence kinetic energy is high at this stage , the object could be called `` relaxed '' using the structure measures and significant substructure is not visible in the x - ray image .",
    "the result of this difference is that the time scales for continuously elevated @xmath0 are of order 2 - 3 times longer than those for elevated structure measures .",
    "the median interval for enhanced @xmath0 to twice the minimum for a given cluster is approximately @xmath99=1 gyr . for @xmath31 and @xmath62 , this number is closer to @xmath99= 0.33 gyr . for these reasons , translating from the observed structure measures to the dynamical state , or more specifically to the energetics of the bulk motion of the gas ,",

    "* ) , we show that @xmath0 drops significantly in cluster volumes over much shorter timescales ( @xmath100 gyr ) .",
    "however , these results may be consistent , given that the @xcite result uses a different criterion ( turbulent pressure @xmath101% of the total pressure ) than we do for elevated turbulence .",
    "the relatively quick drop in tke , coupled to short synchrotron cooling times , may account for the sharp difference in x - ray structure for rh versus non - rh clusters .",
    "an interesting result of this work is that we find that many clusters spend a large fraction ( @xmath280+% ) of their time in disturbed states , while others spend very little time ( @xmath210% ) in such states .",
    "thus , it may be the case that some galaxy clusters are rarely , if ever radio halo clusters during their lifetime , while others almost always host radio halos .",
    "while the typical timescale for the turbulence kinetic energy to be elevated is @xmath102 gyr , these periods can be as long as 5 or more gyrs in cluster which experience complex or repeated mergers .",
    "finally , we find no obvious evidence for bimodality of the @xmath77-@xmath103 relation ( where @xmath103 could be a proxy for radio power ) in our simulated sample of clusters .",
    "however , this is not necessarily surprising given that there are a number of reasons why such a gap may exist in the observed @xmath77-@xmath76 relation that are unrelated to the dynamical state of the gas .",
    "for example , we have not modeled magnetic field variations , and the turbulent re - acceleration mechanism requires a pre - existing population of crs on which to operate , both of which may vary from cluster to cluster .",
    "@xcite have shown that the relationship between the kinetic energy in turbulence and the fixed band radio luminosity is not linear .",
