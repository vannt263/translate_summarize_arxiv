    "nearby galaxies ( z @xmath2 0.1 ) are characterized by large angular scale and high apparent brightness , which can be studied in more details and with higher accuracy than high - redshift galaxies . for nearby galaxies , the ultraviolet ( uv ) imaging provides unique information .",
    "massive , young stars emit strong uv energy , which dominates the integrated uv light of star - forming galaxies .",
    "thus , the uv flux is widely used as an excellent and accurate measurement of the current star formation rate ( sfr ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the interstellar dust can absorb the uv light and then re - emit at far - infrared wavelength .",
    "the comparison between infrared and uv emission can effectively trace the dust attenuation in galaxies .",
    "radiative transfer models suggest that the ratio of far - infrared to uv luminosity is a reliable estimator of the dust attenuation @xcite , depending weakly on the geometry of stars and dust , the extinction law , and the stellar population .",
    "the uv galaxy samples in the local universe are important for understanding the evolution of galaxies with cosmic time @xcite .",
    "there have been considerable attempts to explore the sfr , morphology , dust attenuation , and their evolutions by constructing uv - selected local galaxies @xcite .    based on _ galex",
    "_ public release 2 and 3 ( gr2/gr3 ) , @xcite ( hereafter _ galex _ atlas ) presented a uv catalog of 1034 nearby galaxies selected from the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "they selected those galaxies whose optical diameters of the @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 isophote ( d25 ) are larger than 1 .",
    "the fuv and nuv images were mainly taken from _",
    "_ nearby galaxies survey ( ngs ) . from the surface brightness profiles",
    ", they obtained asymptotic magnitudes , colors , and concentration indices . in combination with archival optical and infrared data",
    ", they analyzed the color - magnitude and color - color diagrams , relations between colors and morphologies , irx@xmath5 relation , dust attenuation , and structural properties for different types of galaxies .    in february 2013 , _",
    "gr7 data was available .",
    "it includes more than 45000 images , almost three times larger than gr2/gr3 . with deeper observations ( up to 250 kilo - second )",
    ", it is now possible to create a relative complete uv sample of nearby galaxies . in this work ,",
    "we provide an updated uv catalog of nearby galaxies with deepest fuv and nuv images from gr6/gr7 , archival optical and infrared photometry , and make some similar analysis to @xcite .    in section  [ data ]",
    ", we present our sample selection of nearby galaxies . in section",
    "[ sbm ] , the method of measuring the surface brightness profile is described in detail .",
    "the catalog content including the uv parameters and other archival data are described in section [ cc ] .",
    "the parameter comparison of our catalog with _",
    "altas is shown in section [ compga ] .",
    "section [ aa ] presents some analyses and application examples of our catalog .",
    "the summary is in section [ sum ] .",
    "all magnitudes presented in the paper are corrected for the galactic extinction using the galactic reddening map of @xcite .",
    "we use the reddening law of @xcite to convert @xmath6 to the uv extinction : @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the nearby galaxies in this paper are extracted from hyperleda ] @xcite .",
    "hyperleda is a catalog of extragalactic sources , which gives accurate coordinates of objects ( typical accuracy better than 2@xmath9 ) , morphological parameters ( e.g. size , axis ratio , position angle , morphogical type , etc . ) , and astrophysical parameters ( optical magnitudes and colors , surface brightness , distance , kinematic quantities , etc . ) .",
    "it includes 3.7 million galaxies , much more than rc3 as used by @xcite .",
    "the catalog provides doppler distances for 20314 galaxies and redshift - independent distances for 2013 galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig1]a shows the distributions of major - axis diameters in both hyperleda and rc3 catalogs , while figure [ fig1]b presents the same distributions but with d25 @xmath10 .",
    "the majority of hyperleda galaxies have diameters less than 1 , and over 99% rc3 galaxies are included in hyperleda .",
    "the hyperleda galaxies with diameters above 1 are more than those of rc3 by a factor of 3 .",
    "we adopt the same criterion of optical diameters as @xcite used , that is , d25 is larger than 1@xmath11 .",
    "there are 22948 galaxies satisfying this constraint .",
    "we retrieve fuv and nuv images for these galaxies from _ galex _ gr6/gr7 to obtain their intensity maps .",
    "three imaging surveys are involved : medium imaging survey ( mis ) , nearby galaxy survey ( ngs ) , and deep imaging survey ( dis ) .",
    "we require the galaxies ( 1.5 @xmath12 d25 ) to be fully covered by the _ galex _ field of view ( fov ; 1.2 in diameter ) .",
    "those galaxies with low signal - to - noise ratio or contaminated by surrounding galaxies and bright stars are excluded .",
    "the optical diameter d25 of m31 is about 3.0 , far beyond the _ galex _ fov .",
    "we obtain 26 tiles of m31 in fuv and nuv from ngs and dis , which are stacked to form very deep mosaics by montage .",
    "the final sample contains 4138 galaxies , 2321 of which have both fuv and nuv observations .",
    "there are 14 and 1803 galaxies having only fuv and nuv observations , respectively .",
    "we present their basic parameters given by hypeleda in table 1 , including the positions , sizes , morphological types and distances . for galaxies whose distances are not available , we get their distances from ned ( the nasa / ipac extragalactic database )",
    ". there are 4047 galaxies with either luminosity distances or redshift - dependent distances .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the normalized distributions of d25 diameter , morphological type , and distance in _ galex _ atlas and our sample .",
    "by contrast , our sample gives more galaxies with smaller diameters , earlier types , and larger distances .",
    "_ galex _ provides sky background subtracted images , but the background near the galactic center is overestimated , especially for galaxies with large apparent sizes .",
    "we introduce a new procedure to better estimate the sky background , which is quite similar to the method in @xcite .",
    "sextractor @xcite is used to separate source pixels from background pixels .",
    "the source pixels , together with the region with the galactocentric distance @xmath13d25 , are masked .",
    "then , the remaining pixels are fitted with a two dimensional polynomial function to generate the background map .",
    "finally , the fitted map is subtracted from the intensity image .",
    "foreground stars contaminate the galaxy flux and need to be masked in the intensity map .",
    "we get the point sources ( mostly stars ) within the image from _ galex _ photometric catalogs .",
    "the mask aperture is determined by the growth curve , where the corresponding aperture magnitude is close to the total magnitude presented in the catalog . however",
    ", the catalogued point sources might include some star formation regions , whose uv color is much bluer than normal stars . since the number of star formation regions is strongly dependent on the galaxy type , we separate our entire sample into two subsamples according to the morphological type : one with t @xmath14 @xmath150.5 identified as spiral / irregular galaxies ( types from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ) and the other with t @xmath18 @xmath150.5 identified as elliptical / lenticular galaxies ( types from @xmath19 to @xmath20 ) . for early - type galaxies , all point sources detected by _",
    "galex _ are regarded as foreground stars and masked . for late - type galaxies",
    ", we only mask the point sources with ( fuv @xmath15 nuv ) @xmath21 1 , and keep bluer point sources with ( fuv @xmath15 nuv ) @xmath18 1 as star forming regions .",
    "the nuclei of galaxies , also point - like , are not masked . for galaxies with single uv - band observations , we define foreground stars by visually inspecting both the uv image and the color image of the digitized sky survey .",
    "we then use the matlab package of astronomy and astrophysics for the measurement @xcite .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile is computed with a series of elliptical annuli , whose major radii range from 3@xmath9 to at least 1.5 times the d25 radius .",
    "the brightness errors are estimated with the method in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows some examples of the false color images and surface brightness profiles of galaxies in our sample .",
    "the radial ( fuv @xmath15 nuv ) color profile is also plotted .",
    "we adopt the technique introduced by @xcite to calculate the asymptotic magnitudes .",
    "first , the accumulated flux and the gradient of the growth curve at each radius are computed .",
    "then , an appropriate radial range away from the galaxy center is visually chosen , where an error - weighted linear fit to the relation of accumulated flux vs. the gradient of the growth curve is performed .",
    "finally , the intercept of this linear fit is regarded as the asymptotic magnitude , and corresponding magnitude error is derived from the error of the linear fit .",
    "we also calculate the aperture magnitudes inside the d25 ellipses .",
    "the errors are estimated from the random noise inside the apertures and the uncertainties of the sky background subtraction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "all the errors do not include the uncertainty of nuv and fuv photometric zeropoints , which are about 0.15 and 0.09 mag , respectively .      based on the growth curve",
    ", we derive the radii containing 50% , 20% , 25% , 75% , 80% of the total luminosity ( @xmath22,@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , resepectively ) .",
    "the effective surface brightness is calculated as @xmath27 and the concentration indices are calucated as c31=@xmath25/@xmath24 and c42 = 5log(@xmath26/@xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "multi - wavelength data of nearby galaxies could improve our understanding of their physical nature .",
    "we add some corollary data from other optical and infrared surveys into our catalog .",
    "hyperleda provides the total @xmath28 magnitude ( @xmath29 ) and the total @xmath30 magnitude ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "a total of 4064 galaxies have @xmath29 magnitudes and 3265 galaxies have @xmath31 magnitudes .",
    "there are 640 and 813 galaxies in our sample with @xmath32 and @xmath33 colors , respectively . in near infrared ( nir )",
    ", we compile @xmath34-band photometry from the 2mass large galaxy atlas ( lga ) @xcite .",
    "if galaxies are unavailable in lga , @xmath34 photometry in 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ) are used .",
    "a total of 3708 galaxies have @xmath34 magnitudes . in mid and far infrared ( mir and fir ) , the photometry in 12@xmath35 m , 25@xmath35 m , 60@xmath35 m and 100@xmath35 m are obtained from infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) .",
    "we follow the priority given by @xcite to compile the photometry ( @xcite and the @xmath36 point source catalog ) .",
    "the 60@xmath35 m and 100@xmath35 m are used to estimate the far infrared emission .",
    "there are 1570 galaxies with infrared fluxes in both 60@xmath35 m and 100@xmath35 m .",
    "the uv properties and archival optical and ir data are presented in presented in table [ tab2 ] and table [ tab3 ] , respectively .",
    "we show the photometric comparisons between _ galex _ atlas and our sample in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "figure [ fig4]a  d display the differences of asymptotic and aperture magnitudes between our catalog and _ galex _ atlas .",
    "there are 94% and 93% galaxies in the fuv and nuv with the difference of asymptotic magnitudes within 0.5 mag .",
    "we check the galaxies with differences larger than 0.5 mag and find that these differences might be caused by the different sky - background estimation and elliptical parameters inherited from their parent catalogues .",
    "we fit a sky background map for each galaxy , while _ galex _ atlas only use a single background value .",
    "for example , the average background of pgc 4085 ( eso 243-g041 ) given by _ galex _",
    "atlas is 5.59 @xmath12 10@xmath37 counts s@xmath38 in the nuv , while the average value of our computed background is 2.24 @xmath12 10@xmath39 counts s@xmath38 , which leads to the magnitude difference of 0.59 . after checking the intensity image , our fitted background is more reasonable , since the flux of no - signal area around the galaxies is about 2 @xmath12 10@xmath39 counts s@xmath38 .",
    "there are many galaxies in _ galex _ atlas and our sample with different axis ratios and d25 diameters .",
    "when galaxies become fainter , the difference of the axis ratios can reach a factor of 9 , which leads to different growth curves and results in different magnitudes .",
    "for example , the axis ratio of pgc 4190 ( ngc 0407 ) given by hyperleda is 6.9 , while _ galex _ atlas gives 4.3 .",
    "these differences lead to the different magnitudes between _ galex _ atlas and our sample .",
    "figure [ fig4]e and f show the differences between the ( fuv - nuv ) colors of asymptotic and aperture magnitudes .",
    "the colors of our sample is consistent with those in the catalogues of _ galex _ atlas with standard deviations of 0.19 and 0.13 for asymptotic and aperture colors , respectively .",
    "the differences of the concentration indices for the two samples are displayed in figure [ fig4]g and h. the concentration indices in both fuv and nuv of our samples are on average smaller than those in _",
    "galex _ atlas , probably due to the differences of the growth curves .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the distributions of uv properties of the galaxies in our catalog .",
    "figure [ fig5]a - g presents the histograms of asymptotic magnitudes , morphological type , luminosities , ( fuv @xmath15 nuv ) colors , effective radii , and concentration indices .",
    "the median asymptotic magnitudes in fuv and nuv are 17.55 and 17.20 mag , respectively . in our sample , about 5@xmath40 galaxies show asymptotic magnitudes larger than d25 magnitudes . for these galaxies ,",
    "the diameters corresponding to asymptotic magnitudes are smaller than the d25 diameters due to the lack of diffuse emission . the residual flux after background subtraction within d25 ellipses leads to additional uv flux in the d25 magnitudes .",
    "there are 1030 ( 25% ) and 2899 ( 70% ) early and late - type galaxies ( figure [ fig5]b ) , and 209 ( 5% ) galaxies without morphological types given by hyperleda .",

    "the galaxies are on average slightly more concentrated in the nuv than in the fuv by differences of 0.03 in c31 and 0.10 in c42 , which may be due to the different fractions of the bulge component in spiral galaxies in these two bands @xcite .",

    "the late - type galaxies are brighter and located in a narrow color range , while the early - type galaxies are fainter and distributed with broader and redder color span .      the plot of effective surface brightness versus the fuv luminosity is presented in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "this figure shows a trend of slight increasing effective surface brightness with increasing luminosity , indicating that galaxies with large effective radii turn to be more luminous @xcite . *",

    "both of them have very compact nuclei in the fuv , and the optically thick accretion disks around super - mass black holes probably dominates their fuv luminosity @xcite .",
    "compared to the optical colors @xcite , the combination of uv and ir should be more efficient in separating the early and late - type galaxies , given their different sfrs and dust attenuation @xcite .",
    "since the uv emission is very sensitive to the presence of recent star formation activity and the @xmath50 band emission is sensitive to the accumulated star formation @xcite , the ( fuv @xmath0 ) color provides a robust discrimination between early and late - type galaxies as analyzed by @xcite .    figure [ fig7]a shows the relation between ( fuv @xmath0 ) color and galactic morphology .",
    "here we convert the 2mass @xmath50 band vega magnitudes to the ab system by adding 1.84 mag @xcite .",
    "we calculate the dividing ( fuv @xmath0 ) color to separate early and late - type galaxies by minimizing the number of galaxies that are misclassified by the dividing magnitude , which leads to ( fuv @xmath0 ) = 6.84 .",

    ", the irx-@xmath1 relation is not valid for early - type galaxies , since a substantial part of dust heating is due to photons emitted by old stars which do not emit primarily in uv and the dust attenuation would be overestimated by irx @xcite .",
