    "accumulated cosmological and astrophysical observations have confirmed the existence of the cold dark matter @xmath3",
    "@xcite , which requires an extension to the minimal standard model ( sm ) . since the nature of the dark matter and the way it interacts with the sm particles remain mysteries , it catalyzes various portals of the dark matter .",
    "strengths of interactions between ordinary matter and dark matter are severely constrained by the observed dark matter relic abundance and exclusion limits from dark matter direct and indirect detections .",
    "thanks to the advancement of the technology , many well - motivated dark matter models were tested and excluded by the dark matter direct and(or ) indirect detection experiments !",
    "it raises challenge to the dark matter model building , but shows people hope of discovering dark matter in the laboratory .    among various dark matter models ,",
    "flavored dark matter  @xcite is interesting and appealing for the following three reasons : ( 1 ) it may naturally explain the galactic center gamma ray excess  @xcite observed by the _ fermi - lat _  @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) it is tightly connected with the flavor physics .",
    "( 3 ) it may release the tension between the observed dark matter relic density and constraints from underground laboratory direct detections .",
    "besides , collider searches of the flavored dark matters are accessible and it was pointed out that collider searches are remarkably complementary for the quark(lepton)-portal dark matter models  @xcite . notice that dark matter could be incorporated into numerous models of flavors .",
    "it deserves a systematic study of these models .",
    "in this paper we study phenomenologies of the tau lepton flavored dark matter by assuming dark matter is a dirac fermion and mainly couples to the third generation leptons with an extra scalar doublet and a charged scalar singlet as mediators .",
    "we focus on the following aspects of this model : i ) the dark matter electromagnetic form factors , ii)its relic density , iii ) signatures in the dark matter direct detection and iv ) the impact of the model to the @xmath4 coupling as well as @xmath5 coupling , where @xmath6 is the sm - like higgs .",
    "our findings can be summarized as the followings :    * the tension between the dark matter relic density and direct detection is highly loosed even for @xmath7 yukawa couplings of the dark matter with tau lepton .",
    "the charge radius of the dark matter dominates the scattering of the dark matter with the nuclei for light dark matter case while the magnetic moment plays more important role in direct detections for the heavy dark matter case . * the yukawa coupling of @xmath8",
    "can be significantly changed compared to the sm case .",
    "tau lepton mass arises from two parts in this model : the general yukawa interaction and the one - loop radiative correction , whose effect is roughly proportional to the dark matter mass .",
    "it turns out the loop effect can contribute about @xmath0 of the total tau mass . *",
    "higgs to diphoton decay rate can be slightly modified in this model .",
    "the ratio @xmath9 can be in the range @xmath10 , which is still consistent the current bounds given by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "the signatures of the dark matter at colliders are also briefly discussed in the paper . compared with previous studies of lepton portal dark matter models , as was mentioned in the references ,",
    "our studies are new in the following aspects : ( 1 ) we focus on the multi - mediator scenario ; ( 2 ) the yukawa couplings of @xmath11 and @xmath5 can be significantly modified in this model .",
    "let s comment on a possible extension of this tau flavored dark matter model .",
    "if one assumes the dark matter couples both to the muon and tau leptons , then the observed higgs to @xmath12 decay rate  @xcite can be generated , but it also gives an overly estimated branching ratio of @xmath13 .",
    "thus the lepton flavored dark matter model can hardly explain the higgs lepton - flavor - violating decays .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows : we briefly describe our model in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "section  [ sec : pheno ] is focused on the phenomenologies of the model , including dark matter relic density , signatures in direct detections , the @xmath14-lepton mass , @xmath15 and @xmath16 decay rate .",
    "the last part is concluding remarks .",
    "we extend the sm with an inert scalar doublet , a singly charged scalar singlet and a dirac dark matter , which is stabilized by a @xmath17 discrete flavor symmetry , under which dark matter and the third generation leptons are odd while all other particles are even . in the following we first describe scalar interactions , then go to the dark matter interactions .",
    "the scalar potential can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the sm higgs doublet , @xmath20 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath21 is the inert scalar doublet , @xmath22 is the singly charged scalar singlet and @xmath23 has mass dimension + 1 .",

    "notice that all direct detection limit lines intersect at four points when @xmath137 just like the case of the relic density contours .",
    "this is because @xmath138 and @xmath139 are both independent on the mixing angle @xmath35 in this scenario and the contribution arising from the anapole moment is velocity suppressed and thus negligible .",

    "<S> in this paper we preform a systematic study of the tau flavored dark matter model by introducing two kinds of mediators ( a scalar doublet and a charged scalar singlet ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic properties of the dark matter , as well as their implications in dark matter direct detections , are analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the model turns out contributing a significant radiative correction to the tau lepton mass , in addition to loosing the tension between the measured dark matter relic density and constraints of dark matter direct detections . </S>",
    "<S> the loop corrections can be @xmath0 of the total tau mass . </S>",
    "<S> signal rates of the higgs measurements from the lhc in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels , relative to the standard model expectations , can be explained in this model . </S>"
