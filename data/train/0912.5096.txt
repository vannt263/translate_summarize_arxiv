    "two - dimensional incompressible and inviscid flows are described by the 2d euler equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the vorticity , @xmath2 the stream function and @xmath3 the velocity field ( @xmath4 is a unit vector normal to the flow ) .",
    "the 2d euler equations are known to develop a complicated mixing process which ultimately leads to the emergence of large - scale coherent structures like jets and vortices @xcite .",

    "one question of fundamental interest is to understand and predict the structure and the stability of these quasi stationary states ( qsss ) .",
    "this can be done by using elements of statistical mechanics adapted to the 2d euler equation .    in recent years",

    "they propose a pragmatic approach where only the robust constraints ( energy and circulation ) are taken into account while the fragile constraints ( casimirs ) are treated canonically .",
    "this is equivalent to introducing a prior vorticity distribution @xmath6 .",
    "this prior vorticity distribution is assumed to be determined by the properties of forcing and dissipation . the equilibrium state is then obtained by maximizing a relative entropy @xmath7 $ ] ( depending on the prior ) while conserving only energy and circulation ( robust constraints ) .    some relaxation equations towards the statistical equilibrium state",
    "have been proposed in each case .",
    "considering the mrs approach , robert & sommeria @xcite obtained a relaxation equation from a maximum entropy production principle ( mepp ) by maximizing the production of entropy @xmath5 $ ] at fixed energy , circulation and casimirs . on the other hand , considering the eht approach , chavanis @xcite showed that the prior determines a generalized entropy @xmath8 $ ] and that the mean flow is a maximum of generalized entropy at fixed energy and circulation .",
