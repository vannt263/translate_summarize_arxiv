    "low energy ( large distance ) effects in qcd can only be studied by approximate ( nonperturbative ) methods in the framework of various effective models or in terms of lattice calculations . at present time , one of the most popular qcd - like effective theories is the well - known nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , which is a relativistic quantum field theory with four - fermion interactions .",
    "the physics of light mesons ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , diquarks @xcite and meson - baryon interactions @xcite-@xcite based on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking can be effectively described by njl chiral quark models .",
    "moreover , njl models are widely used in nuclear physics and astrophysics ( neutron stars ) for the investigation of quark matter @xcite , to construct alternative models of electroweak interactions @xcite and in cosmological applications @xcite . moreover",
    ", its ( 2 + 1)-dimensional analogue serves as a satisfactory microscopic theory for several effects in the physics of high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "the njl model displays the same symmetries as qcd .",
    "so it can be successfully used for simulating some of the qcd vacuum properties under the influence of external conditions such as temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the role of such considerations significantly increases especially in the cases , where numerical lattice calculations are not admissible in qcd , i.e. at nonzero density and in the presence of external electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown in the framework of a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional njl model that an arbitrary small external magnetic field induces the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath2sb ) even under conditions , when the interaction between fermions is arbitrary weak @xcite .",
    "later it was shown that this phenomenon ( called magnetic catalysis effect ) has a rather universal character and gets its explanation on the basis of the dimensional reduction mechanism @xcite .",
    "( the recent reviews @xcite consider the modern status of the magnetic catalysis effect and its applications in different branches of physics . )    as an effective theory for low energy qcd , the njl model does not contain any dynamical gluon fields .",
    "such nonperturbative feature of the real qcd vacuum , as the nonzero gluon condensate @xmath3 can , however , be mimicked in the framework of njl models with the help of external chromomagnetic fields . in particular , for a qcd - motivated njl model with gluon condensate ( i.e. in the presence of an external chromomagnetic field ) and finite temperature , it was shown that a weak gluon condensate plays a stabilizing role for the behavior of the constituent quark mass , the quark condensate , meson masses and coupling constants for varying temperature @xcite .",
    "then , in a series of papers , devoted to the njl model with gluon condensate , it was shown that an external chromomagnetic field , similar to the ordinary magnetic field , serves as a catalyzing factor in the fermion mass generation and dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry as well @xcite .",
    "the basis for this phenomenon is the effective reduction of the space dimensionality in the presence of external chromomagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "there exists the exciting idea proposed more than twenty years ago @xcite-@xcite that at high baryon densities a colored diquark condensate @xmath4 might appear . in analogy with ordinary superconductivity ,",
    "this effect was called color superconductivity ( csc ) .",
    "the csc phenomenon was investigated in the framework of the one - gluon exchange approximation in qcd @xcite , where the colored cooper pair formation is predicted selfconsistently at extremely high values of the chemical potential @xmath5 mev @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such baryon densities are not observable in nature and not accessible in experiments ( the typical densities inside the neutron stars or in the future heavy ion experiments correspond to @xmath6 mev ) .",
    "the possibility for the existency of the csc phase in the region of moderate densities was proved quite recently ( see e.g. the papers @xcite-@xcite as well as the review articles @xcite and references therein ) . in these papers",
    "it was shown on the basis of different effective theories for low energy qcd ( instanton model , njl model , etc . )",
    "that the diquark condensate @xmath4 can appear already at a rather moderate baryon density ( @xmath7 mev ) , which can possibly be detected in the future experiments on ion - ion collisions .",
    "since quark cooper pairing occurs in the color anti - triplet channel , the nonzero value of @xmath4 means that , apart from the electromagnetic @xmath8 symmetry , the color @xmath9 should be spontaneously broken down inside the csc phase as well . in the framework of njl models",
    "the csc phase formation has generally be considered as a dynamical competition between diquark @xmath4 and usual quark - antiquark condensation @xmath10 .",
    "however , the real qcd vacuum is characterized in addition by the appearence of a gluon condensate @xmath11 as well , which might change the generally accepted conditions for the csc observation . in particular",
    ", one would expect that , similarly to the case of quark - antiquark condensation , the process of diquark condensation might be induced by external chromomagnetic fields . for a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quark model , this was recently demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "there , a @xmath12 chirally symmetric ( 2 + 1)-dimensional njl model with three colored quarks of two flavors was considered at zero @xmath13 .",
    "it was shown that in this case for arbitrary fixed values of coupling constants there exists a critical value of the external chromomagnetic field at which a csc second order phase transition is induced in the system .",
    "since the two - flavored qcd@xmath14 and the considered njl model are not in the same universality class of theories ( qcd@xmath14 with n@xmath15 has a higher flavor symmetry @xmath16 ) , the obtained results are intrinsic to real qcd@xmath17 rather than to qcd@xmath14 . indeed ,",
    "our recent investigations on the basis of a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl model @xcite and @xmath18 show that some types of sufficiently strong external chromomagnetic fields may catalyze the diquark condensation .",
    "as argued above , csc might occur inside neutron stars and possibly become observable in ion - ion collisions , i.e. at nonzero baryon densities .",
    "taking into account the fact that at finite chemical potential the magnetic generation of dynamical @xmath2sb qualitatively differs from the @xmath18 case @xcite , one might expect analogous effects for csc , too . by this reason ,",
    "the investigation of the chromomagnetic generation of csc under the influence of a finite chemical potential ( finite particle density ) is a very interesting and actual physical problem .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the influence of external conditions such as chemical potential , temperature and especially of the gluon condensate ( as modelled by external color gauge fields ) on the phase structure of quark matter with particular emphasize of its csc phase . to this end",
    ", we shall extend our earlier analysis of the chromomagnetic generation of csc at @xmath18 @xcite-@xcite to the case of an ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl type model with finite chromomagnetic field , temperature and chemical potential presenting a generalization of the free field model of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections ii and iii the extended njl model under consideration is presented , and its effective potential ( @xmath19 thermodynamic potential ) at nonzero external chromomagnetic field , chemical potential and temperature is obtained in the one - loop approximation .",
    "this quantity contains all the necessary informations about the quark and diquark condensates of the theory . in the following section iv the phase structure of the model",
    "is discussed on the basis of numerical investigations of the global minimum point of the effective potential . as our main result , it is shown that the external chromomagnetic field can induce the transition to the csc phase and diquark condensation even at finite temperature .",
    "thereby , the characteristics of the csc phase can significantly change in dependence on the strength of the chromomagnetic field .",
    "finally , section v contains a summary and discussion of the results .",
    "some details of the effective potential calculation are relegated to an appendix .",
    "let us first give several ( very approximative ) arguments motivating the chosen structure of our qcd - motivated extended njl model introduced below .",

    "finally , by performing a fierz transformation of the interaction term , one obtains a four - fermionic model with @xmath28and @xmath29interactions and an external condensate field @xmath30 of the color group @xmath20 given by the following lagrangian as well as pseudo - scalar , vector and axial - vector - like @xmath29 -interactions . for our goal of studying the effect of chromomagnetic catalysis for the competition of quark and diquark condensates ,",

    "it was supposed earlier in some papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) that quantitative features of the color superconducting phase transition might indeed depend on the value of the form factor parameter @xmath181 .",
    "so , in order to check the @xmath181-dependence of our results , we perform the investigations for three different values of the cutoff , @xmath1890.6 gev , 0.8 gev and 1 gev . for each value of @xmath181",
    ", the corresponding value of @xmath190 is selected from the requirement that the gmp of the function @xmath191 at @xmath192 is at the point @xmath193 gev , @xmath194 in agreement with phenomenological results and @xcite .",
    "then , the value of @xmath195 is fixed by the relation ( [ gg ] ) .",
    "this yields , for example , @xmath196 at @xmath197 gev , @xmath198 at @xmath199 gev etc .",
    "note , further that in the case of zero temperature we have @xmath200 @xmath201 in order to study the phase structure of the model using numerical methods , the summation over @xmath154 in ( [ 21 ] ) is limited by a maximum value @xmath202 , where other terms of the series can be neglected due to their smallness .",
    "first of all , it should be remarked that , as in paper @xcite at @xmath184 , a mixed phase of the model was not found for @xmath171 , i.e. for a wide range of parameters @xmath203 we did not find a global minimum point of the potential ( [ 21 ] ) , at which @xmath204 , @xmath205 .",
    "the results of our numerical investigations of the gmp of @xmath206 are graphically represented in the set of figs . 1 - 6 , where the notations i , ii and",
    "iii are used for the symmetric phase , for the phase with chiral symmetry breaking and for the csc phase , respectively . for the points from region",
    "i the gmp of the potential lies at @xmath207 , @xmath208 . in region",
    "ii we have a phase with broken chiral symmetry , corresponding to the gmp of the potential at @xmath204 , @xmath208 . finally , the color superconducting phase with the gmp of the potential at @xmath207 , @xmath205 , corresponds to the points from region iii of these figures .    in fig . 1 , one can see the phase portrait of the model in terms of @xmath209 at @xmath210 for each of the above mentioned values of the cutoff @xmath181 .",
    "the boundary between phases iii and ii is practically @xmath181-independent and represents a first order phase transition curve @xmath211 .",
    "it is necessary to note also that for each value of @xmath181 and a fixed value of @xmath212 there is a critical chemical potential @xmath213 , at which the gmp is transformed from a point of type iii to a symmetric point of type i. however , this phase transition is remarkably @xmath181-dependent . indeed ,",
    "even in the simplest case with @xmath170 we have @xmath214 gev at @xmath215 gev , @xmath216 gev at @xmath197 gev , @xmath217 gev at @xmath199 gev .",
    "it is well - known from the one - gluon exchange approximation in qcd @xcite that csc can exist even at enormously high values of the chemical potential @xmath5 mev .",
    "so the above mentioned njl framed transition from phase iii to phase i looks , in the case @xmath210 , rather like an artefact of the regularization procedure .",
    "the diquark condensate vanishes , which is the consequence of the regularization by a form factor . in this region",
    ", it might be necessary to use another approximation for the csc investigation . ] thus , since this phase transition turns out to be unphysical , it is not shown in fig .",
    "the critical curves of this figure are obtained by interpolation in the most simple manner , i.e. by a second order polynomial , of numerical points lying at @xmath218 gev@xmath219 ( for technical reasons , such points are explicitely shown in fig.2 , rather than in fig.1 ) earlier , in the papers @xcite the model ( 1 ) at @xmath220 and in the presence of an external magnetic field was considered . as shown there , for small values of the magnetic field strength the critical curves , as well as various thermodynamical and dynamical parameters of the system ,",
    "demonstrate oscillating behaviour . in order to make more accurate interpolations and to become sure whether analogous oscillations appear in the present case ( i.e. , for the critical curves in figs.1 , 2 ) as well , or do",
    "not , one should make an enormous amount of numerical calculations , which proved to be rather difficult to accomplish . due to this",
    ", we can make only a conjecture of an oscillating behavior of the critical curves judging from the positions of the points we have really calculated .",
    "note further that in the region of low chromomagnetic fields , @xmath221 gev@xmath219 , we have extrapolated the critical curves to the known points at @xmath184 .    in fig .",
    "2 , the phase portrait of the model in terms of @xmath209 at @xmath222 gev is presented for each value of parameter @xmath1890.6 gev , 0.8 gev , and 1 gev .",
    "one can see that the boundary between ii and iii phases ( a critical curve of a first order phase transition ) only slowly changes with varying @xmath181 .",
    "the second order phase transition from the csc phase iii to the symmetric phase i , which for finite t is now supposed to really exist , also has a weak @xmath181-dependence for @xmath221 gev@xmath219 . at greater values of @xmath212",
    "the boundary between iii and i phases has , however , a stronger @xmath181-dependence .",
    "the phase diagrams in the @xmath223 plane for @xmath184 and @xmath224 gev@xmath219 are schematically represented in fig .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath225 plane for @xmath226 gev is represented in fig .",
    "4 . for both figures",
    "we choose @xmath197 gev , for simplicity .",
    "it is necessary to point out that at @xmath184 the numerical results of figs .",
    "14 coincide with those obtained in @xcite at @xmath197 gev .",
    "moreover , it should be emphasized that in all the above mentioned figures , a second order phase transition takes place at the boundary of the region i. at the boundary between regions ii and iii a first order phase transition takes place .",
    "let us for a moment fix the value of the chemical potential and temperature at varying values of @xmath212 . in this case , in the figs . 1 , 2",
    ", one will have a straight line parallel to the @xmath212 axis .",
    "in particular , if @xmath226 gev and @xmath210 , in fig.1 this line originates at @xmath184 in the csc phase iii . at some ( critical ) value @xmath227 gev@xmath219",
    "it crosses the line @xmath211 and then , at yet greater values of @xmath212 , it passes through the phase ii .",
    "accordingly , at @xmath228 the gmp of the effective potential lies at the point @xmath229 , where @xmath130 is equal to the diquark condensate in the true stable vacuum , whereas at @xmath230 the point @xmath231 ceases to be a gmp . in this case",
    "it is only a local minimum point , so that @xmath205 corresponds to a metastable ground state of the system ( for the stable ground state at @xmath230 the gmp is of the form @xmath232 ) .",
    "thus , the value @xmath233 is the so - called evaporation point for the diquark condensate .    in fig . 5 ,",
    "the diquark condensate @xmath130 is depicted as a function of @xmath212 for three values of the temperature at @xmath226 gev and @xmath197 gev ( in this figure , due to problems with distinguishing closely positioned points for different cutoff values , we restricted ourselves to plotting curves for only one cutoff value @xmath234 gev . ) .",
    "thick curves correspond to a stable diquark condensate ( the point @xmath231 is the global minimum of the effective potential ) , and thin curves correspond to a quasistable diquark condensate ( this is a local minimum ) .    here",
    "we should note that recent investigations yield the following value of the qcd gluon condensate at @xmath235 : @xmath236 gev@xmath219 @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the framework of a quark - meson model at ordinary nuclear density @xmath237 the gluon condensate decreases by no more than six percent , compared with its value at zero density .",
    "at densities @xmath238 the value of @xmath239 decreases by fifteen percent .",
    "this means that for values of the chemical potential @xmath240 gev the gluon condensate is a slowly decreasing function vs @xmath1 . taking in mind this fact",
    ", one can draw an important conclusion from our numerical analysis : at @xmath170 , @xmath210 and @xmath226 gev there should exist the csc phase ( see @xcite ) . however , if the condensate value @xmath241 gev@xmath219 is taken into account at @xmath226 gev , then our model consideration concludes that the csc phase does not exist at @xmath210 for such a large value of the gluon condensate ( cf . figs . 4 , 5 ) .",
    "assuming that our results would remain valid also for more realistic condensate fields , this would seemingly render it difficult to observe a csc phase for @xmath210 at @xmath226 gev .",
    "notice , however , that our results change at finite temperature .",
    "first , if one takes @xmath242 gev and @xmath226 gev , then at sufficiently small values of @xmath212 there is a symmetric phase of the theory , where both @xmath10 and @xmath4 condensates are zero ( see fig .",
    "however , at the point @xmath243 gev@xmath219 there is a second order phase transition to the csc phase ( here only @xmath244 ) , and at the point @xmath245 gev@xmath219 the external field destroys the csc in favour of the chiral phase , where @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed at @xmath222 gev and @xmath226 gev ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . secondly",
    ", if one takes @xmath222 gev and @xmath248 gev , then at sufficiently small values of @xmath212 there is a symmetric phase of the theory , where both @xmath10 and @xmath4 condensates are zero ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . however , at the point @xmath249 gev@xmath219 there is a second order phase transition to the csc phase , where only @xmath244 .",
    "hence , in some cases the gluon condensate can induce the csc ( the so - called chromomagnetic catalysis effect of csc ) .",
    "this effect is further illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , where the diquark condensate vs @xmath212 is depicted at @xmath250 gev for two temperatures @xmath210 , @xmath222 gev and two values of @xmath197 gev and @xmath199 gev .",
    "one can easily see that the value of @xmath251 for @xmath222 gev is identically zero for @xmath252 gev@xmath219 with @xmath234 gev , and for @xmath253 gev@xmath219 with @xmath254 gev , i.e. , for each value of @xmath181 , there exists a critical value of @xmath212 at which the nonzero diquark condensate is generated .",
    "finally , let us make some additional remarks concerning the diquark condensate at @xmath250 gev . as it follows from our numerical analysis at @xmath210",
    "( see fig . 1 , 6 ) , for @xmath250 gev , @xmath184 , the gmp of the effective potential corresponds to the csc phase with a stable diquark condensate @xmath255 gev .",
    "however , assuming that the value of the gluon condensate @xmath256 gev@xmath219 would hold for the above nonvanishing chemical potential , one would get a value of the diquark condensate @xmath257 gev , which is significantly larger in magnitude , than at @xmath184 .",
    "it follows from fig . 6",
    "that the diquark condensate noticeably depends on @xmath181 .",
    "one could suppose that this is due to the rather high value of the considered chemical potential , @xmath250 gev .",
    "however , as our calculations show , a similar @xmath181-dependence of the diquark condensate occurs for smaller values of @xmath1 as well .",
    "these results confirm the conclusions of the paper @xcite obtained at @xmath170 that the value of the diquark condensate varies with @xmath181 , if the form factor regularization is used in the njl model .",
    "in contrast , the points of the boundary between ii and iii phases do not show a remarkable @xmath181-dependence ( see fig .",
    "1,2 ) .    as a general conclusion",
    ", we see that taking into account an external chromomagnetic field at least in the form as considered in the model above , might , in principle , lead to remarkable qualitative and quantitative changes in the picture of the diquark condensate formation , obtained in the framework of njl models at @xmath170 .",
    "this concerns , in particular , the possibility of a transition to the csc phase and diquark condensation at finite temperature . clearly , a detailed quantitative discussion would , however , require to have additional information on the gluon condensate as a function of the temperature and chemical potential and on a possible @xmath1-and @xmath212-dependence of the cutoff parameter @xmath181 .",
    "a further interesting generalization could be to extend this kind of approach to inhomogeneous background field configurations @xcite .",
    "this concerns , in particular , the nonabelian condensate fields of the stochastic vacuum model of qcd realizing wilson s area law of confinement @xcite .",
    "in the present paper the influence of different physical factors on the phase structure of the two - flavor njl model ( 1 ) with two independent structures of four - quark interactions has been considered .",
    "this model is adequate for the description of the low energy physics of two - flavor qcd both in @xmath258- and @xmath259 channels . in the papers @xcite-@xcite it was shown that in qcd - motivated type of models ( 1 ) with @xmath170 the new color superconducting ( csc ) phase can exist for moderate values of the chemical potential ( baryon density ) . as generalization of the `` free field '' njl model of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have , in particular , taken into account such nonperturbative feature of the real qcd vacuum as the nonzero gluon chromomagnetic condensate @xmath260@xmath261 , which in the framework of a njl model can be simulated by an external chromomagnetic field .",
    "the recent estimates give the following fixed value @xmath262",
    "gev@xmath219 @xcite for the gluon condensate in qcd at @xmath263 .",
    "despite of this fact , we considered it , however , useful to treat @xmath264 as a free external parameter of the model .    since in the csc phase the original @xmath265(3 ) symmetry of the theory",
    "is spontaneously broken down to @xmath265(2 ) , five color gauge bosons acquire masses .",
    "the corresponding external fields are expelled from the csc phase ( meissner effect ) . however , the other three `` color isospin '' gauge bosons remain massless , in accordance with the residual @xmath265(2 ) symmetry of the vacuum .",
    "clearly , the corresponding external fields may then penetrate into the csc phase .",
    "it is just the influence of these types of external chromomagnetic fields on the formation of csc which was studied in our previous paper @xcite in the framework of a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional njl model for vanishing chemical potential and temperature .",
    "there it was shown that chromomagnetic fields may induce the csc phase transition . in the present paper ,",
    "the chromomagnetic generation of csc has been studied in the framework of a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl model for finite chemical potential and temperature .",
    "the vector - potential of the external chromomagnetic field was chosen to be of the matinyan - savvidy form ( [ x7 ] ) and lies in the algebra of the residual @xmath265(2 ) group , too .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath169 of our model ( 1 ) are considered as free independent parameters . in our numerical estimates , we found it convenient to use the relation ( [ gg ] ) in order to `` normalize '' our calculations at @xmath171 on the known results at @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "however , we hope that our qualitative conclusions remain also valid for values of @xmath169 in some neighbourhood of ( [ gg ] )",
    ". the results of numerical investigations of the effective potential ( [ 21 ] ) are presented in a set of figs 16 , where phase diagrams for the extended njl model ( 1 ) in terms of @xmath266 as well as the behaviour of diquark condensates versus @xmath212 are shown .",
    "first of all we should note that the form factor regularization of the njl model ( 1 ) is used throughout in the present paper . as shown in @xcite , in this case",
    "even at @xmath170 the features of csc depend on the value of the form factor parameter @xmath181 .",
    "so , in order to clarify the corresponding situation at @xmath267 , we have used three different values of @xmath1890.6 gev , 0.8 gev , and 1 gev in the regularization scheme under consideration .",
    "one can see that phase transitions between the chirally broken and csc phases have rather weak @xmath181-dependence ( see figs 1,2 ) , whereas the diquark condensate values noticeably depend on @xmath181 ( see , e.g. fig . 6 ) .",
    "the main conclusion of our investigations is that the inclusion of an external chromomagnetic field can significantly change the phase portrait , obtained at @xmath170 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath268 the values of the chemical potential corresponding to the csc phase approximately lie in the interval @xmath269 gev ( see fig .",
    "if the external chromomagnetic field of the type ( [ x7 ] ) is switched on at @xmath226 gev , then at @xmath270 gev@xmath219 there is a transition of the system from csc to a phase , where only chiral symmetry is broken down .",
    "thus , at @xmath262 gev@xmath219 , @xmath226 gev and @xmath210 the csc can not be observed at all .",
    "however , if @xmath210 and the chemical potential is fixed at @xmath250 gev , then at least for all values @xmath271 gev@xmath219 one can observe the csc phase in which the diquark condensate @xmath272 is nonzero .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in this case the function @xmath272 is monotonically increasing ( see fig .",
    "6 ) and the value of the diquark condensate at @xmath273 turns out to be significantly greater in magnitude than at vanishing @xmath264 .",
    "the real gluon condensate is the same as at @xmath274 .",
    "however , using a given @xmath275-dependency of the gluon condensate , it would be possible to extract physical informations about the csc phase using our phase diagrams in figs",
    ". 1 - 4 and plots of @xmath272 functions in figs . 5 , 6 .",
    "]    finally , one should note that at @xmath276 the external chromomagnetic field can induce the csc phase transition .",
    "for example , at @xmath222 gev and @xmath250 gev there is a symmetric phase of the theory in which @xmath277 ( both chiral and diquark condensates are zero ) for sufficiently small values of @xmath212 ( see fig .",
    "however , at some critical point @xmath278 , a phase transition of the second order from the symmetric to the csc phase is induced by the external chromomagnetic field .",
    "notice that the csc induction by some types of external chromomagnetic fields was observed in the framework of a njl model at zero @xmath1 , @xmath0 ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the present analysis shows that this effect takes place at some nonzero values of @xmath275 , too , which in principle could be important for heavy ion - ion collisions taking place at nonzero temperature .",
    "clearly , a somewhat unpleasant feature of the above njl approach , which requires some caution , is the @xmath181 dependence of some of the results .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the above results are interesting and may serve as a starting point for further investigations of this issue .",
