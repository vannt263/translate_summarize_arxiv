    "the radiative capture reaction @xmath0 ( @xmath3  mev ) takes place during stellar core helium burning @xcite , where @xmath4c is produced by the triple - alpha process . the capture cross section @xmath5 at the relevant gamow energy , @xmath6  mev for @xmath7",
    "k , determines  together with the convection mechanism at the edge of the stellar core @xcite  the abundances of carbon and oxygen at the end of helium burning .",
    "this , in turn , strongly influences the nucleosynthesis of elements up to the iron region for massive stars @xcite and the composition of co white dwarfs , whose progenitors are intermediate and low mass stars @xcite .",
    "a recent experiment confirmed that the reaction rate of the triple - alpha process is known with a precision of about 10% for temperatures near 10@xmath8 k @xcite .",
    "a similar precision is needed for the rate of @xmath4c(@xmath9)@xmath1 to provide an adequate input for stellar models @xcite .",
    "the remarkable experimental efforts over the last decades @xcite focused on the observation of the capture @xmath10-rays , including one experiment @xcite that used the coincident detection of the @xmath1 recoils . due to the low cross section and various background sources depending on the exact nature of the experiments ,",
    "@xmath10-ray data with useful but still inadequate precision were limited to center - of - mass energies @xmath11 to 3.2  mev . at the low - energy range ,",
    "the data were limited e.g. by cosmic - ray background and at the high - energy range the data were limited by intense background reactions such as @xmath12c(@xmath13,n)@xmath14o ( for an @xmath13-beam experiment ) and @xmath4c(@xmath4c , n)@xmath15 mg ( for a @xmath4c - beam experiment ) .    the cross section @xmath5 is expected to be dominated by p - wave ( e1 ) and d - wave ( e2 ) capture to the ( @xmath16 ) @xmath1 ground state .",
    "two bound states , at 6.92 mev ( @xmath17 ) and 7.12  mev ( @xmath18 ) , which correspond to subthreshold resonances at @xmath19 and @xmath20  kev , appear to provide the bulk of the capture strength @xmath5 through their finite widths that extend into the continuum .",
    "r - matrix analyses are performed , in order to model the energy dependence of the cross section . in these analyses",
    "the contribution of each amplitude to the total cross section is expressed in terms of a small number of resonances and a direct capture contribution .",
    "the parameters of the model are determined by a fit to the experimental data .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath21  mev is sensitive to the properties of the nearby levels , but it is sensitive also to the properties of the high lying resonances , since their tails extend to low energy .",
    "the effect of these resonances is usually included by a single high energy `` background '' resonance ",
    "one for each amplitude ; these resonances are needed to obtain a good fit to the data .",
    "analyses of the available capture data together with data from the @xmath22c elastic scattering and the @xmath23-delayed @xmath13-decay of @xmath14n still lead to large uncertainties in the extrapolation to e@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this is partly caused by large errors , both statistical and systematic , affecting the low energy capture data , and partly due to the weak experimental constrains of the background resonances .",
    "clearly , new measurements at low energies are needed . however , of equal importance are also new measurements at significantly higher energies , well above the range of the recent experiments , which may improve the experimental characterization of the background resonances and may thus reduce the uncertainty in the extrapolated astrophysical s factor s(e@xmath24 ) .",
    "there may exist even an s - wave capture ( monopole e0 ) and significant capture amplitudes to excited @xmath1 states .",
    "since the various capture amplitudes have different energy dependences , a better knowledge of the individual amplitudes requires new data at both low and high energies to provide an improved basis for their extrapolation to e@xmath24 .",
    "schematic diagram of the recoil separator erna .",
    "wf = wien filter , qs = quadrupole singlet , qd = quadrupole doublet , qt = quadrupole triplet , st = steerer , fc = faraday cup , ss = slit system , ap = aperture . at the end of the separator , there is a @xmath25e - e telescope for particle identification.,width=302 ]    a new experimental approach ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) has been developed at the 4  mv dynamitron tandem accelerator in bochum , called erna = european recoil separator for nuclear astrophysics @xcite . in this approach , the reaction is initiated in inverse kinematics , @xmath26he(@xmath4c,@xmath10)@xmath1 , i.e. a @xmath4c ion beam with a particle current of up to 10  @xmath27a is guided into a windowless @xmath26he gas target .",
    "a beam contamination in the order of @xmath28 @xmath14o ions per incident @xmath4c projectile was found , by far too high for a direct detection of the @xmath14o recoils .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of beam purification , there is one wien filter before the analysing magnet ( wf1 , not shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) and one before the gas target ( wf2 ) ; with this combination a beam purity better than 10@xmath29 could be achieved @xcite . the windowless gas target - entrance and exit aperture of the gas cell with a diameter of 6  mm - includes an ar post - target stripping system .",
    "after the gas target , the separator consists sequentially of the following elements : a quadrupole triplet ( qt ) , a wien filter ( wf3 ) , a quadrupole singlet ( qs ) , a 60@xmath30 dipole magnet , a quadrupole doublet ( qd4 ) , and a wien filter ( wf4 ) . the recoil separator suppresses the intense @xmath4c beam ; the @xmath1 recoils in a selected charge state are then counted in a @xmath25e - e telescope placed at the end of the beam line .",
    "the ratio between leaky @xmath4c events detected in the telescope and the number of @xmath4c projectiles is in the range of @xmath31 at the high energy limit and @xmath32 at the lower limit .",
    "additionally , a beam suppression factor of the telescope alone of 10@xmath33 - ratio of @xmath14o and leaky @xmath4c in the @xmath25e - e matrix ( fig .",
    "[ matrix ] ) - can be achieved leading to a total suppression factor of better than @xmath34 .",
    "erna is designed to study the reaction over the energy range @xmath35 to 5.0  mev .",
    "the detection of the @xmath1 recoils allows , for the first time , a direct measurement of the total cross section of @xmath36 , including possible non radiative transitions .",
    "the number n@xmath37 of recoils collected in the telescope is given by the relation    @xmath38    where n@xmath39 and n@xmath40 represent , respectively , the target number density and the number of projectiles impinging on the target , @xmath41 is the cross section at the effective interaction energy e@xmath42 , t@xmath43 is the transmission of erna for the recoils in the selected charge state of probability @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the detection efficiency of the telescope .",
    "therefore @xmath41 can be determined with high precision , if all quantities in eq .",
    "1 are known with high accuracy .",
    "identification matrix of the @xmath25e - e telescope at @xmath46  mev for the standard @xmath26he target and ar post - stripper density ( upper panel ) .",
    "the different components are labeled .",
    "the lower panel shows the background at the same energy measured only with the ar post - stripper after removing the @xmath26he target gas .",
    "the running time for both spectra is the same.,width=264 ]    the thickness of the extended windowless he gas target was determined using the @xmath26he(@xmath47li,@xmath10)@xmath48b reaction at @xmath49  mev @xcite , energy loss measurements of different ions @xcite , and the @xmath26he(@xmath47li,@xmath26he)@xmath47li@xmath50 reaction at @xmath51  mev @xcite .",
    "the weighted average of the results yields n@xmath52  atoms/@xmath53 with an effective target length of @xmath54  mm , that corresponds to an energy loss , e@xmath55 , for the @xmath4c ions smaller than 25 kev in the investigated energy range .",
    "the small target thickness leads to a nearly constant cross section along the target , thus e@xmath42 = ( e@xmath56/2)*m@xmath39/(m@xmath57 ) .",
    "the number of projectiles n@xmath40 is determined through the detection of the elastically scattered @xmath26he nuclei in two collimated silicon detectors located in the target chamber at 75@xmath30 from the beam axis .",
    "calibration runs performed at each energy before and after the measurement runs allowed to relate the observed scattering rate to the concurrent beam current .",
    "the scattering rate was measured in short runs of typically 60 s to achieve a statistical precision of better than 1% .",
    "the beam current without target gas was monitored in a faraday cup ( fc2 ) located after the quadrupole triplet before and after the determination of the scattering rate .",
    "this procedure was found to be independent of the beam focussing and reproducible within the statistical error .",
    "a 100% transmission of the incident beam through the gas target is a requirement of the separator @xcite and was verified by the full transmission through a retractable focussing aperture in front of the gas cell with a diameter of 3  mm .",
    ".[table1]astrophysical s(e ) factor of @xmath0 .",
    "the quoted errors are statistical only .",
    "the data in the energy range of the narrow resonances are left out . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the charge state distribution @xmath44 of the @xmath1 recoils produced in the @xmath26he gas target depends on the geometric origin in the target : @xmath1 recoils produced in the upstream part of the target will most likely reach an equilibrium charge state distribution in the passage of the remaining target length , while those produced near the downstream end of the target will not , i.e. they will keep memory of the charge state at the moment of their formation . since this effect is not accurately predictable @xcite , the charge state distribution of the @xmath1 recoils after passing the he gas is affected by a significant uncertainty .",
    "to remove this uncertainty , an ar stripper was installed after the @xmath26he gas target with a number density @xmath58  atoms/@xmath53 .",
    "this density is sufficient for all ions produced at different locations in the @xmath26he target to reach the same charge state distribution .",
    "finally , the observed @xmath1 charge state distribution in the combination of @xmath26he and ar gas was measured over the full energy range @xcite : for each charge state the separator was set properly and the resulting current observed at the end of the separator in fc4 ( fig . [ setup ] ) .",
    "the measured charge state distribution differs from the equilibrium charge state distribution of @xmath14o ions in ar gas @xcite due to the effect of charge exchange in the @xmath26he rest gas in the downstream pumping stages of the gas target after the post - target stripper .",
    "this effect is energy and charge state dependent and amounts to a chance of the equilibrium charge state distribution of 20  % at most .",
    "the transmission of the separator t@xmath43 essentially depends on its acceptance compared to the emittance of the recoils , which in turn depends on @xmath10-ray emission , target effects , and the beam emittance .",
    "the angular acceptance of erna has been measured using an @xmath1 beam and an electrostatic deflection unit @xcite , which can deflect the beam at any position within the target region in order to simulate the recoil ion angular opening at the different geometrical locations where @xmath1 recoils are produced .",
    "the energy acceptance was measured by varying the beam energy from the accelerator . for both quantities ,",
    "erna turned out to fulfill the requirements for measuring @xmath41 in the energy range @xmath59 to 5.0  mev within a region of @xmath60  mm around the target center , that includes 96% of the target nuclei .",
    "the angular straggling of the recoils in the gas target results in a loss of recoils less than 0.5  % , which gives a final value of @xmath61 @xcite . the detector efficiency @xmath62 is reduced by the transparency t@xmath63 of the grids of a parallel grid avalanche counter at the entrance window of the @xmath25e - e telescope leading to a total detection efficiency @xmath64 .",
    "it is important to note that the 100  % transmission of the recoils in the selected charge state is a key requirement for measuring reliably the absolute capture cross section @xmath41 using a recoil mass separator .",
    "indeed , this is a condition for determining @xmath41 without a detailed knowledge of the distribution of the recoils in the phase space , which depends on the @xmath10-ray energy and @xmath10-ray angular distribution , on target effects and beam emittance .    finally , background runs ( fig .",
    "[ matrix ] lower panel ) were performed at each energy using the ar post - target stripper only .",
    "the measurements showed the presence of an @xmath1 background , where at energies above 2.0  mev a signal - to - background ratio of typically 20 was observed .",
    "the observed background rate in the region of interest was normalized to the number of projectiles and subtracted at each energy .",
    "an investigation of this @xmath1 background excluded as possible sources a beam contamination , which is suppressed by the erna beam purification system , as well as elastic scattering on rest gas .",
    "there are strong indications that the background is mostly due to the fraction of the @xmath4c beam impinging on the plates of the first wien filter , and possibly other beamline components , producing @xmath1 via @xmath4c+@xmath4c fusion , e.g. the @xmath4c(@xmath4c,@xmath8be)@xmath14o reaction .",
    "since the fraction of the beam impinging on the plates increases with decreasing energy , measurements at energies lower than @xmath65  mev are affected by a signal - to - background ratio significantly poorer than at higher energy .",
    "[ sfactor ] and table [ table1 ] show the total s(e ) factor at @xmath66 to 4.9  mev obtained with erna ; the statistical error is of the order of 4% or less at energies above 2.2  mev and the systematic error is 6.5% ( 3% n@xmath67 , 2% n@xmath68 , 1% t@xmath69 , 2% @xmath70 , 0.5% @xmath45 ) . in fig .",
    "[ sfactor ] we present also a comparison of our data with the sum of the different amplitudes as reported in @xcite , i.e. the ground state transition ( e1 and e2 ) plus cascade transitions . note the good agreement in absolute s(e ) values between previous work and the present data on top of the @xmath71 , 3.2 , and 4.3  mev resonances .",
    "the r - matrix calculation represents the best fit to the available experimental data at that time including resonance information from @xcite .",
    "one should note that in this analysis the interference effects of the cascade transitions are neglected .",
    "there is a clear disagreement at energies around @xmath72 and 4.0  mev , where the calculation of @xcite underestimates the total cross section , while it slightly overestimates the cross section on the high energy tail of the broad j@xmath73=1@xmath74 resonance at @xmath71  mev .",
    "a preliminary analysis indicates that these discrepancies may be partly caused by a wrong choice of the interference pattern of the different amplitudes , especially of the e2 amplitude .",
    "the analyses @xcite show that the @xmath75-fit is hardly sensitive to different e2 interference patterns leading to a broad range of extrapolated @xmath76 values .",
    "a detailed study of the influence of the present data on s(e@xmath24 ) is in progress , that requires an r - matrix code including a fit to the different amplitudes ( see for example @xcite ) as well as to the total cross section .",
    "finally , a new resonance was found in @xmath0 at @xmath77  mev , corresponding to a known 0@xmath78 state ( @xmath79  kev ) reported in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the recoil data results in a resonance strength @xmath80  mev .",
