    "shortly after bose einstein condensation @xcite was obtained in trapped alkali atoms @xcite , many theoretical and experimental studies focused on the quantum coherence properties of such systems .",
    "it was shown that apart from the usual decoherence , which stems from the imperfect isolation from the environment , the system also suffers phase diffusion @xcite , which is due to the atomic number fluctuations in the condensate @xcite .",
    "there is a third source of decoherence which limits the life time of excitations in becs .",
    "this mechanism is based on the existence of a group of _ thin spectrum _ states @xcite .",
    "the relation of thin spectra with decoherence of excitations is recently proposed and applied to lieb - mattis model and superconductors by the same authors @xcite .",
    "effect of a thin spectrum on quasiparticle excitations on becs is discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we review these ideas with some extensions and also discuss the decoherence that a double well bec experiences .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii begins with a review of a toy model for zero mode dynamics , studying coherent , squeezed coherent and thermal coherent ground state lifetimes",
    ". a toy model for a double well condensate is also introduced and coherent and squeezed coherent states in such a system is studied . in section iii",
    "we apply the thin spectrum formalism to atomic becs and discuss its similarities and differences with other calculations . after making some comments about the existence of a second thin spectrum in a double well system and outlining the calculation of lifetime in a double well system ,",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "acknowledgements are in section v.",
    "in order to understand the basic idea underlying the phase diffusion at zero temperature , it is useful to introduce a toy model @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian of a homogeneous bose einstein condensate in the weakly interacting limit is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the annihilation operator of the @xmath2 mode and @xmath3 is the parameter determining the strength of interactions between bosons , that is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the quantization volume . in order to fix the average number of atoms , a chemical potential @xmath6",
    "is also included in single particle energy : @xmath7 .",
    "we are interested in the zero - mode dynamics of the system , so we discard terms including @xmath8 and redefine @xmath6 in order to get the basic @xmath9 gauge symmetric hamiltonian : @xmath10 the grounstate of such a hamiltonian is clearly a fock state with a number @xmath11 determined by @xmath6 .",
    "however , fock states have no definite phase and since bose einstein condensation entails a phase - symmetry broken state , the groundstate we seek can not simply be a fock state . the simplest idea is to consider a coherent state @xmath12 with @xmath13 , as coherent states are the simplest states carrying a ( almost ) definite phase . a second step can be considering squeezed coherent states @xcite , which again carry some phase information , but the uncertainty in their phase can be larger or less than a corresponding coherent state . and finally , it is important to find a state which both carries phase information and is temperature dependent . for this purpose",
    ", we are going to introduce the _ thermal coherent states _ after studying the zero - mode evolutions of coherent and squeezed coherent states .      the coherent ( or quasi - classical @xcite )",
    "state @xmath14 is defined as the right eigenstate of the annihilation operator and has the fock state expansion @xmath15 this simple expansion makes it possible to calculate the time dependence of the expectation value of the annihilation operator @xmath16 , which we consider as the order parameter , possible .",
    "we define the energy of the @xmath17-th fock state @xmath18 as @xmath19 through @xmath20 .",
    "this gives the simple time dependent expression @xmath21\\right){\\rm e}^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\mu t } , \\label{gte}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose short time behavior is found to be @xmath22 therefore , the order parameter decays exponentially @xcite . at longer time scale @xmath23 revives due to discrete and thus periodic nature of the exact time evolution ( [ gte ] ) .",
    "however , the ratio of the revival time @xmath24 to the collapse time scales as @xmath25 , and hence in the thermodynamic limit the collapse is irreversible . denoting the density of condensed atom numbers in the quantization volume as @xmath26",
    ", collapse time @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 to see its behavior in the thermodynamic limit more directly .",
    "as @xmath29 is fixed in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath11 and @xmath5 increases indefinitely , we see that @xmath30 increases indefinitely .",
    "revival time @xmath31 increases with @xmath11 linearly . in practice ,",
    "the available condensates contain small number of atoms and furthermore , they are in traps that makes them inhomogeneous systems .",
    "our homogeneous system hamiltonian can qualitatively describe their collapse time behavior by letting @xmath5 denote the condensate mode volume , though @xmath32 would have different expressions for the case of a trapped condensate .",
    "in particular , collapse time of a harmonically trapped three dimensional isotropic condensate in a coherent state behaves like @xmath33 in the thomas - fermi limit @xcite .",
    "homogenous condensate collapse time is growing much faster , as @xmath34 . despite these quantitative differences",
    ", we can still express @xmath30 of homogeneous bec in terms of parameters of a trapped bec .",
    "for that aim we shall only eliminate @xmath35 via the characteristic length scale for a harmonic trap potential as @xmath36 in terms of the harmonic trap frequency @xmath37 .",
    "we find @xmath38 where @xmath39 . assuming a typical situation of current experiments with @xmath40 , @xmath41 nm , @xmath42 @xmath6 m , and @xmath43 m@xmath44",
    ", we get @xmath45 . for a harmonic trap with @xmath46 hz",
    ", this amounts to @xmath47 seconds , clearly within the regime to be confirmed and studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "the squeezed coherent state @xcite @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the unitary squeezing operator and @xmath51 is the displacement operator .",
    "this again is a minimum uncertainty state , but the quantum fluctuations of two quadratures are not equal to each other",
    ". arguments of @xmath52 and @xmath53 determine which quadrature is _ squeezed _ at the expense of increased uncertainty of the other one .",
    "in particular , if both parameters are real and positive , then the state is _ number squeezed _ , that is the uncertainty of the number operator is reduced whereas the conjugate variable , phase , has a higher uncertainty .",
    "such a state resembles a fock state more than a coherent state and therefore is expected to have a longer life time , since the phase collapse speed is generally proportional to @xmath54 , which is smaller in this case , as have recently observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "this situation is analogous to the dispersion of a wavepacket consisting of different frequency components .    in terms of a new parameter @xmath55",
    "the fock state expansion of the squeezed coherent state is @xcite @xmath56 here , @xmath57 is the n - th hermite polynomial .",
    "the order parameter becomes @xmath58 which is not possible to evaluate analytically .",
    "we therefore attack the problem using simple numerical methods , and plot the time dependence of the order parameter for various values of @xmath59 , both real and imaginary .",
    "it is clearly seen in figure [ figstm1 ] that squeezing in the number direction increases the life time , whereas in figure [ figstm2 ] we see squeezing in phase direction leads to a faster decay .     and @xmath60 .",

    "when the results for single and double well systems are compared , it is seen that although decay times are both in the same order of magnitude , a double well condensate with equal number of atoms in each well as a single well condensate suffers faster decay .",
    "this agrees with the analytical results obtained in @xcite using the same ansatz for single and double well ground states .",
    "by thin spectrum , we refer to a group of states whose energy spacings are so low that they are not controllable by any experiment and whose effect on the free energy becomes zero in the thermodynamic limit . that the existence of a thin spectrum leads to decoherence of excitations at finite temperature",
    "is proved in @xcite . in @xcite",

    "@xmath142 is the multi - mode squeeze operator @xcite .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider a system with quasiparticle excitations in only one mode .",
    "we denote such a system with @xmath17 atoms in the condensate and @xmath35 quasiparticles with @xmath143 by @xmath144 .",
    "then , @xmath145 @xmath146 we consider single - particle regime such that quasiparticle and particle occupation numbers become the same . due to the number conservation ,",
    "sum of condensate atoms and the quasiparticles should remain the same . to excite @xmath35 quasiparticles",

    "now we bring the system to a superposition of the zero - quasiparticle state and the one quasiparticle state , that is we bring each @xmath148 to @xmath152 .",
    "such a state can be interpreted as a particular qubit @xcite . for thin spectrum to affect the system",
    ", it is essential that we bring the system to a superposition rather than simply exciting a quasiparticle .",
    "now , the off diagonal element of the resulting state s density matrix will evolve according to @xmath153 which gives @xmath154 after omitting terms with only a phase factor . although the denominator and the numerator have quite different forms , we find that both decay in a time proportional to @xmath155 . this is the same result that wezel _ et .",
    "al . _ have found for a crystal @xcite .    for a bec",
    ", we can let @xmath156 and @xmath157 k. this gives @xmath158 seconds , which is much larger than even the ground state life times .",
    "unlike the room temperature mesoscopic system discussed in @xcite , becs are extremely cold systems therefore one single excitation has such a long life time .",
    "however , this does not make the calculation unuseful .",
    "this life time is given only for a single quasi - particle excitation .",
    "in general it might be useful to have more than one quasiparticles excited at a time .",
    "if , for example , the condensate will be used as the building block of a quantum computer , having an excitation consisting of @xmath159 quasiparticles will make observation of the qubit ( superpositions of states with @xmath160 and @xmath35 quasiparticles ) , easier . in order to find a decay time for @xmath161 ,",
    "the only approximation required is @xmath162 and the timescale will be inversely proportional to m. for @xmath163 , so long as it is not the case that @xmath164 , we have @xmath165 seconds . this time scale is much smaller than both the observed and expected ground state life times , therefore is of interest .",
    "there are different studies @xcite concerning the life times of quasiparticle excitations , such as using perturbation theory , etc .",
    "namely , @xcite has found a linear temperature dependence for high energy quasiparticles .",
    "our calculation will make a quantitative contribution to this decay rate .",
    "however , low energy excitations are shown to have more complex temperature dependencies @xcite .",
    "our calculations do not make any predictions for that regime , since we have assumed @xmath166 .",
    "also , our theory predicts a certain dependence of the life time on the number of quasiparticles excited ( which is almost linear for small @xmath35 ) , and this might be used to differentiate it from other theories .    as discussed before , for a group of states to be a thin spectrum , their effect on",
    "the free energy must vanish .",
    "for this purpose , we write the partition function as @xmath167 with @xmath168 . again replacing the sum by an integral",
    "we find that the leading term in the free energy per particle @xmath169 .",
    "this means that the mode we consider has no effect on free energy and satisfies all the criteria to constitute a thin spectrum .",
    "the next step might be to generalize the calculations for coherent of squeezed coherent zero mode occupations .",
    "however , following this path does nt give any finite life time , since the excitation decay due to thin spectrum requires finite temperature , but coherent states have no temperature characteristic .",
    "but it is natural to do the same calculations for thermal coherent zero mode occupation .",
    "such a calculation is presented in @xcite .",
    "decay rate does not have a linear temperature dependence in this case , therefore it might be possible to differentiate between thermal and thermal coherent occupations experimentally .      in @xcite , it is shown that the phase related part of the hamiltonian of a double well condensate can be reduced to the form @xmath170 here , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 are parameters depending on system details , @xmath174 and @xmath175 are the momenta corresponding to the total and relative phases of the condensates , and @xmath176 is the coordinate corresponding to the relative phase .",
    "@xmath110 , again , is a number parameterizing the tunneling between different wells .",
    "( this hamiltonian , originally derived for a condensate consisting of two different types of atoms in a single potential well , is applicable to a double well system when the parameter corresponding to collisions between different types of atoms is taken to be zero . )",
    "when coupling @xmath110 between the wells is taken to be zero , this hamiltonian reduces to one of two free particles : @xmath177 it is seen that the system has two modes corresponding to motions without restoring forces .",
    "the reason is that now that there are two wells , there is an extra symmetry that is spontaneously broken . therefore , there are two different thin spectra .",
    "cumulative effect of multiple broken symmetries ( and hence multiple thin spectra ) on excitation lifetime is studied in @xcite .",
    "if lifetime corresponding to individual thin spectra are @xmath178 and @xmath179 , then the resultant collapse time is the harmonic sum of individual life times : @xmath180 using @xmath53 s corresponding to the system under consideration , it is thus possible to find the resultant life time , which is supposed to be in the same order of magnitude with the smaller life time .",
    "generalizing the toy model calculations @xcite , we discussed the phase decoherence of coherent , squeezed coherent and thermal coherent states . for visual clarity , time dependence of various q functions is shown .",
    "a generalization of the toy model to double well systems is also discussed and time evolution of the order parameter is studied for coherent and squeezed coherent states .",
    "this step , being important not only for double well becs , might bear important results for any josephson - coupled system .",
    "the effect of thin spectrum @xcite on quasiparticle excitations in becs is briefly reviewed .",
    "it is shown that the presence of the so called thin spectrum states , which have vanishing level spacing , also has no effect on free energy per particle in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "qualitative dependence of life time on the number of excitations is given . finally , as a simple example of a system with more than one spontaneously broken symmetry @xcite , a calculation of excitation life time in a double well system is outlined .",
