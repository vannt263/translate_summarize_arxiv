    "modifying the interaction of atoms with the electromagnetic ( em ) field by means of a cavity is at the origin of cavity - qed @xcite . in the first place ,",
    "a perfectly reflecting cavity reduces the density of em states accessible to the spontaneous emission of a single atom .",
    "this results in an enhancement of the atomic lifetime as well as in a shift of the atomic levels . on the other hand",
    ", the strong coupling between the cavity modes and the atomic charges drives the coherent exchange of excitations between the atom and the cavity field .",
    "ultimately , these effects make possible the coherent manipulation of quantum states , the entanglement between separated quantum systems @xcite , and the storage of quantum information .    considering the cavity as a macroscopic system hardly affected by the presence of the atoms inside , the interaction of the free em field with the cavity plates can be integrated out in an effective hamiltonian .",
    "the resultant em interactions of the atoms are commonly referred to as cavity - assisted interactions @xcite .",
    "this is a good approximation as long as the excitation and emission spectra of the atoms and the cavity material do not overlap , and as long as the time resolution of observation is much larger than the time of flight of photons from the atoms to the cavity plates . under these conditions , transient transitions",
    "average out and the effective cavity - assisted interactions become stationary .",
    "the net result is that photon states get _ dressed _ by multiple scattering processes with the cavity plates , and so does the photon propagator .",
    "it is the modes of the dressed em field which are commonly referred to as cavity modes of the cavity field .    for the case of a perfectly reflecting planar cavity , both the atomic level shifts @xcite and the modified lifetimes @xcite of an excited atom have been profusely studied theoretically , and probed experimentally @xcite . in this article we concentrate on the cavity - assisted dipole - dipole interactions between two atoms placed in the middle of a perfectly reflecting cavity  see fig.[fig0qed ] .",
    "this is a common setup in the generation of quantum entanglement with rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches , our calculation applies to any interatomic distance .",
    "we compute several quantities of interest in the non - degenerate , perturbative regime .",
    "these are , the van der waals ( vdw ) potentials for the case that both atoms are in their ground states , for the case that both atoms are excited , and for the case that one atom is excited while the other , of a different kind , is in its ground state .",
    "in addition , we calculate the electrostatic potential between two induced atomic dipoles .",
    "we give in each case the corresponding phase - shift rate of the two - atom wavefunction .",
    "the vdw interaction in the non - perturbative regime will be addressed in a separate publication .",
    "physically , the vdw and electrostatic potentials can be observed through the forces experienced by each atom when placed inside harmonic traps , which are proportional to the displacements of the atoms with respect to their equilibrium positions in the absence of interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase - shift of the two - atom wavefunction can be observed using atom interferometry .",
    "for instance , it is the shift that is observed in the binary interaction of rydberg atoms through the measurement of population probabilities @xcite .",
    "concerning our approach , we apply time - dependent quantum perturbation theory , up to fourth order , in the electric dipole approximation .",
    "the calculation is performed in the non - degenerate , perturbative regime , where the energy difference between the intermediate and initial atomic states is much greater than the interaction energy itself . for the case of the interaction between excited atoms",
    ", the excitation is assumed adiabatic with respect to the detuning between the atomic species , which is a situation commonly encountered in experiments .",
    "the main achievements of this work are , in the first place , the computation of the green function for the cavity field which mediate the interaction between two atomic dipoles placed in the middle of the cavity .",
    "the effects of the confinement of the em field to two spatial dimensions are revealed .",
    "second , we find out novel expressions for the resonant components of the vdw potentials of each atom when excited .",
    "the difference between each atom s potentials as well as their discrepancy with the phase - shift of the wavefunction are exposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[lasec2 ] we describe the setup of the problem and compute the relevant components of the green function of the cavity field . in sec.[lasec3 ] we calculate the vdw potentials and the phase - shifts on two - atom systems in the perturbative regime . in sec.[lasec4 ] we compute the electrostatic potential of two induced dipoles .",

    "we aim at computing the cavity - assisted dipole - dipole interactions between two atoms , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , placed in the middle of a perfectly reflecting planar cavity of thickness @xmath2 , and separated by a distance @xmath3 along an axis parallel to the cavity plates ( see fig.[fig0qed ] ) .",
    "these interactions are mediated by virtual photons created and annihilated at the position of each atom .",
    "hence the relevant quantity to be computed is the green function of the cavity field that the atomic dipoles induce at the position of each other .    to this end",

    "our semiclassical approximation with regard to the interaction between the em field and the cavity plates consists of assuming that the virtual photons created at the location of one of the atoms reflect off the plates any number of times before being absorbed either by itself or by the other atom . in each reflection process",
