    "the leading logarithmic ( @xmath0 ) and the double - logarithmic approximation schemes provide results about the perturbative regge asymptotics .",
    "these results apply to semi - hard processes where besides of the large energy @xmath1 there is a second large scale @xmath2 controlling the coupling , @xmath3 .",
    "the predictions for the small @xmath4 behaviour of structure functions and on features of the hadronic final state in deep - inelastic scattering at small @xmath4 are in qualitative agreement with experiment and usually attention is paid to the features deviating from the glap evolution . on the other hand the @xmath2 dependence of the small @xmath4 asymptotic results",
    "is determined by the asymptotics of the anomalous dimensions for the continued moment number @xmath5 ( angular momentum ) approaching some integer value .",
    "the relation of the perturbative regge results to anomalous dimensions is well known @xcite .",
    "these asymptotic anomalous dimensions involving the contributions from all orders are useful for checking complete higher order calculations and for improving the kernels in the glap evolution @xcite .",
    "the perturbative regge asymptotics for the vacuum exchange channel , the bfkl pomeron @xcite , has now its place in semi - hard phenomenology .",
    "it is natural to look for situations where the asymptotics of other exchange channels shows up .",
    "the case of flavour non - singlet exchange dominated by fermion and antifermion with the same chirality in the @xmath6 channel has been studied for many years .",
    "the first methods of double - logarithmic approximation to the perturbative regge asymptotics have been worked out in qed @xcite and partially extended to qcd @xcite .",
    "the method of separation of the softest particle @xcite provided an essential simplification and allowed to treat both signature channels .",
    "alternatively the two - fermion exchange can be treated in close analogy to the two - gluon exchange of the bfkl pomeron @xcite . in this way",
    "all contributions with @xmath7 from the longitudinal part of each loop integral are summed up . there may be further single @xmath7 contributions . in this approach",
    "the negative signature case has not been treated yet , because it is related to a three reggeon exchange .",
    "the positive signature part of this channel contributes to the flavour non - singlet @xmath8 structure function @xcite .",
    "the application of the negative signature part to the flavour non - singlet part of the spin structure function @xmath9 has been considered first in @xcite .    the flavour singlet part of @xmath10 corresponds to odd parity exchange . besides of the quarks also",
    "two gluons can be exchanged .",
    "however at least one of the two gluons is of a different type ( helicity state ) compared to the one generating the asymptotics in the vacuum ( bfkl ) channel @xcite .",
    "the leading double log asymptotics has been worked out recently @xcite .",
    "both quark - antiquark and two - gluon intermediate reggeon states give rise to a singularity near @xmath11 and the mixing of these channels has to be considered .",
    "the positive signature part of the odd parity channel can be related to the spin counterpart of the structure function @xmath12 , which is called @xmath13 @xcite or @xmath14@xcite .",
    "odd parity can in principle be transferred by more than two leading ( bfkl type ) gluons .",
    "the corresponding coupling structure ( impact factor ) is not known and is eventually related to higher twist .",
    "this would give rise to a singularity near @xmath15 beyond the leading logarithmic approximation .    from studying the multi - regge",
    "effective action @xcite it is evident that there are two types of fermion exchanges characterized by chirality or helicity and resulting in the same asymptotics .",
    "the resulting two kernels of reggeized two - fermion interactions have been treated in analogy to the bfkl case @xcite .",
    "the case with equal chirality of the two fermions has been mentioned above .",
    "the other case of opposite chirality ( parallel helicity ) of the exchanged quark and antiquark shows some unusual features @xcite .",
    "the leading regge asymptotics ( near @xmath16 ) has no double logarithmic contributions .",
    "double logs contribute at the subleading ( @xmath17 ) level and are connected to the ( one - loop ) glap evolution .",
    "these features are expected to show up in the structure function @xmath18 which appears in the drell - yan process and measures the transversity distribution @xcite .",
    "the multi - regge effective action is a convenient formulation of the leading @xmath0 approximation , i.e. for summing contributions with the leading logarithm arising from the longitudinal momentum integration .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite as a starting point for investigating unitarity corrections ( multi - reggeon exchange with multi - regge kinematics in all @xmath1-channels ) and genuine next - to - leading logarithmic corrections ( quasi - multi - regge kinematics ) .",
    "this action can be derived from the qcd action by separating the gluon and the quark fields into modes according to the multi - regge kinematics .",
    "the `` heavy '' modes , which do not correspond to exchanged or scattered particles , are eliminated .",
    "the exchanged modes correspond to momenta @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the light cone components ( essentially in the direction of the incoming particles ) and @xmath22 are the transverse components . in the light - cone",
    "axial gauge the transverse components of the vector potential @xmath23 describes the physical degrees of freedom of the gluon .",
    "there are two types of exchange fields expressed in terms of the modes ( 1 ) of @xmath24 , @xmath25 the first exchange field gives rise to the leading asymptotics ( @xmath26 ) , whereas the exchange of each @xmath27 leads to a suppression by one factor of @xmath28 .",
    "there are also two types of fermion exchanges characterized by the two chirality projections .",
    "each of them leads to a suppression by a factor of @xmath29 compared to the leading asymptotics .",
    "the two gluon and the two fermion exchanges can be related by supersymmetry .",
    "the terms in the effective action describing the non - leading @xmath27 exchange are not completely known yet .",
    "the effective production vertices with the other three exchanges give rise to the following two - reggeon interaction kernels @xcite , @xmath30 the kernel @xmath31 is not needed for our discussion here .",
    "the first expression in ( 3 ) is the well known bfkl kernel @xcite in the complex notation for the transverse momentum vectors .",
    "the momentum transfer is @xmath32 .",
    "the second kernel @xmath33 corresponds to the equal chirality exchange .",
    "the @xmath34-dependent factors appear due to the double logarithmic behaviour at @xmath35 and at @xmath36 .",
    "the third kernel describes opposite chirality exchange and does not lead to a logarithmic transverse momentum integral .    taking the reggeization into account",
    "the kernels are modified and become infrared finite operators , @xmath37 @xmath38 is the one - loop trajectory function of the gluon ( @xmath39 ) or the quark ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the equations and the resulting @xmath41 reggeon green functions are analogous to the bfkl case .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of vanishing momentum transfer ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "@xmath43    @xmath44 are the eigenvalues of the kernel @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the corresponding eigenfunctions @xcite , @xmath47 @xmath48 denotes the propagator of the exchanged quark ( @xmath49 ) or gluon ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the regge singularities ( branch points ) are located at the point in @xmath34 where two poles in @xmath51 arising from the denominator pinch the @xmath51 integration contour .",
    "also the resummed anomalous dimensions @xmath52 are obtained from this denominator .",
    "it is given by a zero @xmath53 such that @xmath54 for gg or @xmath55 for @xmath56 has a perturbative expansion , i.e. vanishes for @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the analogy to the bfkl case extends also to the remarkable properties of conformal symmetry , factorizability and integrability .",
    "double logarithmic contributions arise in different situations and kinematical regions .",
    "the small @xmath4 asymptotics of the glap evolution matches the large @xmath58 asymptotics of the bfkl evolution . both are dominated by double logarithms from strong ordering in logitudinal and transverse momenta .",
    "the regge asymptotics in the channels of equal chirality quark - antiquark exchange ( @xmath56 ) and odd parity two - gluon exchange ( @xmath59 ) is dominated by double logs , whereby the transverse momentum integral is logarithmic in two regions ( compare @xmath33 in ( 3 ) ) .",
    "the glap evolution in these channels at small @xmath4 accounts for only the logarithms from strongly ordered transverse momenta and therefore does not match the perturbative regge behaviour @xcite .",
    "summing all double logs in these channels leads to involved linear integral equations in momentum representation .",
    "the method of separation of the softest particle leads directly to much simpler equations in terms of partial waves with a quadratic non - linearity @xcite .",
    "one separates a loop in the configuation of transverse momenta in all loops where the one of the separated loop is the smallest .",
    "if the loop is built by a bremsstrahlung gluon gribov s theorem allows to express the low @xmath22 contribution of this loop by contributions with the gluon radiated and absorbed by the external legs of the amplitude without this soft loop @xmath60 .",
    "the second argument indicates that the transverse momenta in all loops are larger than @xmath22 .",
    "the bremsstrahlung contribution has the form @xmath61 the gluon loop leads in particular to a change of the colour state in the @xmath6-channel .",
    "this is described by the matrices @xmath62 and @xmath63 depending to which external legs the gluon is attached .",
    "we change to patial waves @xmath64 the signature factor @xmath65 behaves for small @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "the positive signature contribution of the bremsstrahlung gluons to the partial wave is given by @xmath68 and the negative signature contribution by @xmath69 @xmath70 is diagonal and the element corresponding to the colour singlet channel vanishes .",
    "the positive signature part contributes as a inhomogeneous term to the negative signature channels , which follows from the small @xmath34 behaviour of the signature factor .",
    "the separated soft loop can also be built by a two - particle ( @xmath71 or @xmath59 ) intermediate state in the @xmath6-channel .",
    "this contribution to the amplitude is expressed by a loop integral involving two amplitudes of lower order . in terms of partial waves we obtain",
    "@xmath72 this term conserves signature and all other @xmath6-channel quantum numbers .",
    "it is easy to understand without explicite calculation that the exchange @xmath73 of two leading ( bfkl type ) gluons @xmath74 does not give rise to a double log contributions with these gluons carrying the smallest @xmath22 . by gauge invariance",
    "the amplitudes with external @xmath74 vanish proportional to the small transverse momentum of this gluon .",
    "therefore there is no logarithm from the small transverse momentum integration range .",
    "now the regge amplitude with the double logarithms of the types ( 7 ) and ( 11 ) summed up is the solution of the equation in fig .",
    "1 . starting from the born term one iterates by adding bremsstrahlung loops and by inserting soft @xmath6-channel intermediate states .",
    "the born term has the form @xmath75 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath76 depends on the colour state in the @xmath6-channel . for the colour singlet state we have @xmath77 for @xmath56 and @xmath78 for @xmath59 exchanges . in the parity odd flavour singlet case one",
    "has to consider the coupled channel of both exchanges with born terms describing the transitions in the @xmath6-channel @xmath79 the coefficients @xmath80 coincide with the residues at @xmath81 of the corresponding one - loop anomalous dimensions .    due to the mentioned structure of @xmath70the derivative terms ( 9 ) or ( 10 )",
    "are absent in the colour singlet equation and we have just quadratic equations . we write the solutions for the @xmath71 case . @xmath82 the solution for the colour octet channel @xmath83 enters the solution for the negative signature colour singlet partial wave .",
    "the corresponding equation is of riccati type and the solution is expressed in terms of the parabolic cylinder functions .",
    "the equation for the vitual compton amplitude reduces to a linear equation with the ( appropriate projection of the ) regge amplitude as the born term .",
    "therefore the large @xmath2 behaviour is determined by @xmath84 ( 12 ) , which turn out to be ( up to a factor ( @xmath85 ) the asymptotic anomalous dimensions at @xmath86 .",
    "notice that the born coefficient @xmath80 in the @xmath87 channel is large compared to the @xmath56 channel .",
    "this implies for the position of the regge singularities @xmath88 the large @xmath89 is the origin of the large effect of the double logs on the small @xmath4 behaviour in the flavour singlet @xmath90 obtained in @xcite .",
    "this large effect demands to study the next - to leading log contributions . on the other hand it provides a qualitative understanding of the large gluon contribution to @xmath90 which is observed in the emc effect .",
