    "the inset is schematic edge states for the whole brillouin zone.,width=264 ]    the band structure plot displayed in fig .",
    "[ bulk](a ) shows that monolayer snte is a semiconductor with a small indirect gap located around the @xmath10 point .",
    "moreover , the nearby @xmath18-shape conduction band and @xmath19-shape valence band provide a clear sign of band inversion at @xmath10 point with a large inverted gap ( denoted by @xmath20 ) of about @xmath21 ev at its optimized equilibrium lattice constant of @xmath22   . negative sign of @xmath20 indicates an _ inverted _ gap . to confirm this band inversion , we performed first - principles calculations of monolayer snte under a series of biaxial elastic strain @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ bulk](b ) , when lattice constant ( @xmath13 ) increases , @xmath20 monotonically enlarges and reaches zero at a critical lattice constant of @xmath23   . beyond @xmath24 , @xmath20 becomes positive , indicating a trivial topological phase .",
    "the monotonical change of @xmath20 is very similar to those in bi2se3-type topological insulator  @xcite , which comes from the different parities of bottom conduction band and top valence band at x points : one corresponds to bonding states and the other corresponds to anti - bonding states , whose energy changes oppositely under the biaxial strain . however , the fundamental gap ( denoted by @xmath12 ) has a different behavior . when @xmath25   , @xmath12 is negative , manifesting a semi - metallic nature . as @xmath13 increases , @xmath12 first increases to a local maximum ( @xmath2680  mev ) at @xmath17   , and then decreases to zero at @xmath24 , forming a dirac cone at @xmath10 point as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ bulk](b ) .",
    "the above strain - dependent band structure analysis demonstrates that monolayer snte without strain has an inverted gap at @xmath10 point with a negative value .",
    "according to the parity criteria @xcite , it can not be z2 topological insulator as there are two @xmath10 points in the whole bz .",
    "however , bulk snte has rocksalt crystal structure , and therefore its ( 001 ) monolayer thin films possess @xmath4 mirror symmetry which allows us to define the corresponding mirror chern number @xmath27@xcite . following the similar analysis and argument @xcite",
    ", we can infer monolayer snte is a 2d tci with non - zero mirror chern number @xmath28 .",
    "the physical manifestation of non - zero mirror chern number is the existence of gapless helical edge sates which are protected by @xmath4 mirror symmetry . by performing dft calculations on the 20nm - wide ribbon of monolayer snte",
    ", we explicitly simulated the topological protected edge states .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ edge ] , for the ribbon with small lattice constant 6.4   in the inverted regime ( fig .",
    "[ bulk](b ) ) , there are two bands with linear dispersion crossing each other and connecting from the conduction bands to valence bands . due to time - reversal symmetry , another pair of dirac - type edge states is also present in the gap as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ edge ] , which is consistent with the previous analysis @xmath29 .",
    "since the bands forming the dirac point have different eigenvalues of @xmath4 mirror operation , both inter- and intra- back scattering are forbidden between those states .",
    "thus , if the mirror symmetry is strictly preserved , those edge states can realize quantized transport .",
    "moreover , the mirror is connected with the spin in the system , and transport current should be also spin - polarized .",
    "we also performed dft calculations for multi - layer thin films using the experimental lattice constant of bulk snte , @xmath30   , complementing our previous work  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ orbit](a ) reveals a _ non - monotonically _ change in @xmath20 with increasing thickness .",
    "two critical thickness values divide the phase diagram into three parts .",
    "more specifically , except three , five , and seven layers of snte thin films , all other thin films have negative ( or , inverted ) @xmath20 . for thin films of more than 17 layers",
    ", @xmath20 almost stays constant , reaching the gap of bulk snte .",
    "as the thickness gradually decreases , the confinement effect increases , driving @xmath20 to decrease and reach zero at about 7 layers",
    ". however , the gap did nt continue its monotonic change for thin films of less than 5 layers .",
    "instead , gap closes again between monolayer and 3 layers due to the aforementioned negative inverted gap @xmath20 in monolayer snte .",
    "the thickness - dependent inverted gap is consistent with our previous work @xcite in the multi - layer case , providing a complete phase diagram shown in fig .",

    "( b ) schematic of band evolution in snte .",
    "( i ) in the atomic limit , spin - orbital coupling splits the @xmath9 orbital ; ( ii ) in the bulk limit ( @xmath5 is set along [ 111 ] direction ) , strong chemical bonding between sn and te induces band inversion between @xmath31 of sn and @xmath32 of te , which drives bulk snte into 3d nontrivial tci phase ; ( iii ) for snte ultrathin films of 3 , 5 , and 7 layers , the confinement effect surpasses the inverted bulk gap and removes the band inversion formed in step ( ii ) ; ( iv ) for monolayer ( @xmath5 is set along [ 001 ] direction ) , very different chemical bonding environment of @xmath0 and @xmath1 leads to the asymmetric crystal field effect . as a result , the onsite energy of @xmath1 will be lower ( higher ) than @xmath0 for sn ( te ) , pushing all the @xmath33 states from sn ( te ) to lower ( higher ) energy and hence re - introducing band inversion.,width=321 ]    to elucidate the underlying mechanism of band inversions , we analyzed the orbital evolution in detail and the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ orbit](b ) .",
    "previous works show that the fundamental gap of iv - vi semiconductor is around @xmath13 ( @xmath10 ) points for bulk ( thin films ) , and the bands near the fermi level are mainly composed of @xmath9 orbitals of cation and anion ( sn and te for snte ) @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ orbit](b ) , we start from the atomic limit where the chemical bonding between different atoms are ignored and focus on the @xmath9 orbitals . after taking soc into account ,",
    "the six - fold degenerate @xmath9 orbitals split into four - fold degenerate @xmath34 states and two - fold degenerate @xmath35 states .",
    "@xmath34 states are pushed up while @xmath35 states are lowered down in energy as shown in step ( i ) .",
    "we then included the hopping between those atomic orbitals ( chemical bonds ) .",
    "for the bulk states , the @xmath36 hopping between cation and anion vanishes at @xmath13 points , and the @xmath37 and @xmath38 hopping will play a vital role and lead to the four - fold degenerate @xmath34 states to further split into @xmath39 and @xmath40 states ( @xmath5 along [ 111 ] direction ) .",
    "more importantly , the splitting is even strong enough to lower sn s @xmath41 states than te s @xmath42 states , driving snte into 3d tci phase ( step ( ii ) ) . while for pbte , the splitting induced by chemical bonding is not large enough to promote the band inversion although soc is even stronger .    for the thin films ,",
    "the states around @xmath10 points mainly inherit from the bulk states at @xmath13 point .",
    "when films are thick enough , all the properties of those states such as orbital weights and band orders are preserved , which ensure all the thin films thicker than a critical thickness ( 7 layers for snte ) have negative inverted gap at @xmath10 points and possess the nontrivial topological phase , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath28 . however , as the thickness decreases , the confinement effect will increase , hence enlarge the energy gap between anion and cation like in the normal semiconductor , giving rise to vanishing band inversion ( see step ( iii ) in fig .",
    "[ orbit](b ) ) and topological phase transition as shown around 7 layers in fig .",
    "[ orbit](a ) .",
    "so far , all @xmath43 orbitals are treated equally .",
    "this is reasonable for bulk and thick films , since the difference between all @xmath43 orbitals is negligible .",
    "however , it is no longer true for _ atomically _ thin 2d materials as the chemical environment ( crystal field ) for @xmath1 and @xmath0 is completely different , where @xmath5 is along [ 001 ] direction . for @xmath0 orbitals ,",
    "the crystal field is similar to the bulk where the @xmath0 orbitals between anion and cation form both @xmath44 and @xmath45 type bonding .",
    "however , @xmath44 bond is absent for the @xmath1 orbitals in monolayer .",
    "such kind of asymmetric crystal field leads to the on - site energy of @xmath1 higher or lower than @xmath0 for cation ( sn ) or anion ( te ) , respectively , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this onsite energy difference @xmath48 will push down ( up ) all the @xmath40 states composed of sn cation ( te anion ) orbitals since all those states couple with each other and involve with @xmath49 states ( _ i.e. _ @xmath1 orbital ) . from the dft calculations",
    ", we found the asymmetric crystal field effect is strong enough to invert the bands between anion and cation again as shown in step ( iv ) in fig .",
    "[ orbit](b ) .",
    "we also confirmed this band inversion mechanism and the corresponding topological phase transition by tuning the onsite energy difference in tb calculations .",

    "all the materials have _ negative _ inverted gap at @xmath10 point and @xmath14 . gey ( y = s , se , te ) are semi - metal and all other materials are fully gapped semiconductors . among them , monolayer pbte has the largest fundamental gap of 260 mev.,width=302 ]    it is worth to emphasize that the above band inversion mechanism in _ atomically thin films _ does nt depend on the band inversion in _",
    "bulk_. instead , it critically relies on the competition between the trivial band gap and the strong crystal field effect @xmath48 on the @xmath43 orbitals in the monolayer .",
    "if @xmath48 is big enough , we can also achieve nontrivial topological phases in monolayers of other materials even if their bulk forms do nt have inverted gap . motivated by this mechanism , we calculated other monolayer iv - vi semiconductors xy ( x = ge , pb sn and y = s , se , te ) and found that all them are 2d tcis with @xmath28 in the optimized structure . the detailed band structures can be found in the supplementary materials . in fig .",
    "[ gap ] , we plot the inverted gap at @xmath10 point ( @xmath20 ) and the fundamental gap @xmath12 . except gey ( y = s , se , te ) which are semi - metals@xcite with the largest inverted gap at @xmath10 , all other materials including pby and sny ( y = s , se , te ) are fully gapped semiconductors . among the latter ones , monolayer pbte has the largest fundamental gap of about 260 mev , comparable with all existing and proposed 2d topological materials .",
    "we have confirmed nontrivial topological phases in all the materials by direct edge state calculations @xcite . from the materials perspective",
    ", pbte is perhaps the most promising material to realize the novel application of topologically - protected edge states .",
    "first , pbte holds the highest mobility among all those materials @xcite .",
    "second , pbte can have both _ n_-type and _ p_-type carriers @xcite and its quality is easier to control in experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , except ges , all other materials can realize the rocksalt structure under proper conditions @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that monolayer iv - vi semiconductors in rocksalt structure can be synthesized in experiments and realize the nontrivial topological phase presented above .",
    "in conclusion , using first - principles calculations we theoretically studied the electric structures of monolayer iv - vi semiconductors along [ 001 ] direction . remarkably , contrary to the expectation from the quantum confinement effect , all these materials are 2d tcis with mirror chern number @xmath28 , and monolayer pbte possesses the largest fundamental band gap of 260 mev .",
    "the 1d metallic edge states in these monolayer tcis are protected by top - to - bottom mirror symmetry and robust against any perturbation preserving the mirror symmetry .",
    "the unexpected nontrivial topological phase originates from the strong asymmetric crystal field effect on @xmath0 and @xmath51 orbitals due to the unique characteristic of ultrathin 2d materials .",
    "our work makes monolayer iv - iv semiconductors a promising materials platform to realize novel applications of topological edge states , and offers a new strategy to find other 2d topologically nontrivial materials .",

    "<S> this unexpected nontrivial topological phase stems from the strong _ crystal field effect _ in the monolayer , which lifts the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals and leads to band inversion between cation @xmath1 and anion @xmath0 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> this crystal field effect induced topological phase offers a new strategy to find and design other atomically thin 2d topological materials .    </S>",
    "<S> topological insulators ( tis ) have attracted extensive attention owing to their fundamental theoretical interests and potential applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between crystallography and electronic band topology has further given birth to a new type of topological phases , termed topological crystalline insulators ( tcis ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first example of tcis was recently predicted in snte class of iv - vi semiconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they host even number of dirac cones on their ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) surface @xcite , which were subsequently observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic boundary states of tcis are protected by crystal symmetry rather than time - reversal in tis , and therefore these states can acquire a band gap under perturbations that break the crystal symmetry by either distortion @xcite or electric field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to fundamental interests , tcis may realize novel device applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have further predicted / proposed a wide class of new tci materials in antiperovskites @xcite , pyrochlore iridates @xcite , multi - layer graphene @xcite and heavy - fermion compounds @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more recently , based on tight - binding ( tb ) calculations @xcite , we predicted that two - dimensional ( 2d ) tcis exist in ( 001 ) multi - layer thin films of snte and pb@xmath2sn@xmath3se(te ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that thin films thicker than a critical thickness are topological nontrivial with metallic edge states protected by mirror symmetry @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is normal to the film ) . as thickness of tci thin films decreases , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum confinement effect will increase and eventually overcome the inverted gap , turning these 2d tcis into normal insulators @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that when materials become _ atomically _ thin , the reduced dimensionality may lead to physical properties dramatically different from their 3d counterparts , as found in graphene @xcite , monolayer mos@xmath6 @xcite , monolayer @xmath7-sn @xcite and fese @xcite . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , there are great interests in the exploration of nanostructure of tcis in experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these motivates us to study iv - vi semiconductors in the monolayer form , whose electronic structures may not be captured by the bulk tb parameters @xcite used in previous works .    here , using first - principles calculations , we systematically studied the electronic structures of ( 001 ) monolayer iv - vi semiconductors xy ( x= ge , sn , pb and y= s , se , te ) in the rocksalt structure . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we found all of them are 2d tcis and possess metallic edge states protected by @xmath8 mirror symmetry , contrary to the expectation from the quantum confinement effect . </S>",
    "<S> this unexpected nontrivial topological phase originates from the band inversion due to the strong crystal field effect on @xmath9 orbitals in the monolayer , which significantly lowers ( raises ) the onsite energy of cation ( anion ) @xmath1 orbital , thereby facilitating or even driving the band inversion towards the tci phase . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that this novel mechanism does not rely on the electronic topology of the 3d bulk states : for example , despite that pbte is topologically trivial in the bulk form , monolayer pbte is a 2d tci with a large fundamental gap of 260 mev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore our work reveals a unique advantage of atomically thin 2d materials in realizing 2d topological phases . </S>"
