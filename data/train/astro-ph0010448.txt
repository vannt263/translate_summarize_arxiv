    "the existence of two distinct groups of hot white dwarfs , having either hydrogen - rich or helium - rich photospheres is now , qualitatively at least , understood to arise from the number of times the progenitor star ascends the red giant branch and the amount of h ( and he ) lost through the successive phases of mass - loss .",
    "consequently , it seems clear that each group descends from their respective proposed progenitors , the h - rich and he - rich central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) .",
    "nevertheless , there remain several features of the white dwarf cooling sequence that can not be readily explained .",
    "for example , while the hottest h - rich da white dwarfs outnumber the he - rich dos by a factor 7 ( fleming _ et  al . _  1986",
    ") , the relative number of h- and he - rich cspn is only about 3:1 .",
    "in addition , there exists a gap in the he - rich track between @xmath3k and 30000k between the hot do and cooler db white dwarfs , confirmed by a detailed spectroscopic analysis of all the then known hot he - rich objects by dreizler and werner ( 1996 ) .    to understand white dwarf evolution ,",
    "we need to know accurately several physical parameters for each star . for example",
    ", a measurement of effective temperature ( @xmath4 ) establishes how far along its evolutionary sequence the star has progressed .",
    "a key result has been the establishment of the temperature scale for da stars through the determination of  from the balmer line profiles in optical spectra .",
    "the reliability of this work depends on the assumption that the balmer line profile technique is a reliable estimator of in all cases .",
    "however , barstow holberg &  hubeny ( 1998 ) have shown that the presence of substantial blanketing from photospheric heavy elements does significantly alter the balmer line profiles at a given effective temperature .",
    "hence , the temperature scale of the hottest , most metal - rich da white dwarfs , realised by studies using only pure h photospheric models , can not be viewed as reliable and must be revised taking into account the photospheric composition of each star .    until recently very few da white dwarfs were known to have effective temperatures above @xmath5k .",
    "therefore , the proposed direct evolutionary link between h - rich cspn and white dwarfs has hardly been explored . in particular , there have been no measurements of the photospheric composition of what might be termed super - hot das , to distinguish them from the cooler ranges studied in detail . using a new grid of non - lte , heavy element - rich model atmospheres and a combination of _ hst _  stis and _ fuse _  spectra ,",
    "we have made the first measurements of photospheric abundance for a sample of very hot da white dwarfs .",
    "for comparison , we have also re - examined the archive data of the cooler da stars .",
    "all the new far - uv spectroscopic observations were obtained as part of a joint _ hst _",
    "stis ( cycle 8) and _ fuse _  ( cycle 1 ) programme .",
    "fuse_observations are discussed elsewhere in these proceedings ( barstow _ et  al . _  2000 ) , with examples of typical spectra .",
    "our stis data were all obtained with the e140 m grating and cover the wavelength range from 1150 to 1700 .",
    "figure  1 shows sample regions of the stis spectrum of rej0558@xmath1371 ( for which we also have _ fuse _",
    "data ) , illustrating the detection of nv , ov , siiv and fev .",
    "the stis spectra are typically more sensitive to fe and ni than the _ fuse _  observations and n is not detected by _",
    "fuse_. on the other hand , p and s which are detected in the _ fuse _  range can not be seen by stis .",
    "hence , the two instruments acquire complementary information .",
    "we have calculated a new grid of model stellar atmospheres using the non - lte code . these are based on work reported by lanz _ et  al._(1996 ) and barstow , hubeny &  holberg ( 1998 , 1999 ) . in this case",
    "we have extended the temperature range of the calculations up to 90,000k , to deal with the hotter da stars included in this analysis . to take account of the higher element ionization stages that are likely to be encountered in these objects",
    ", we have added new ions of ovi , fevii / viii and nivii / viii to the model atoms as well as extending the data for important ions such as civ to include more energy levels . as before ,",
    "all the calculations were performed in non - lte with full line - blanketing .",
    "we initially fixed the abundances of the heavy elements at the values determined from our earlier homogeneous analysis of g191@xmath1b2b ( he / h=@xmath6 , c / h=@xmath7 , n / h=@xmath8 , o / h=@xmath9 , si / h=@xmath10 , fe / h=@xmath6 , ni / h=@xmath11 ) . but taking into account that the civ lines near 1550  have subsquently been resolved into multiple component by stis .",
    "abundances were estimated for each element in each star of the sample by matching the data to a synthetic spectrum calculated from the  non - lte model nearest in  and log g using .",
    "abundances were then varied within a narrow range within  to obtain the formal values that give the best representation of the data , summarised in table  1 .",
    "for the hot group of stars ( rej0457 and above ) , gaps in the abundance data arise mostly from the absence of data in the appropriate spectral range , rather than a true absence of these elements . for gd246 and pg1123 , which are of similar temperature to rej0457 ,",
    "the situation is not completely clear cut .",
    "stis observations are available for both these stars , but at higher dispersion with the e140h grating and over a narrower wavelength range than the e140 m .",
    "hence , the 1550  civ resonance lines are not covered while nv , siv and ov are . for the cooler stars gaps in the table",
    "are indicative that the element is not present at abundances detectable by stis or _ iue_.    .table 1 .",

    ", < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "it is no surprise that significant quantities of heavy elements are present in the majority of stars with  in excess of 50,000k .",
    "what is particularly interesting for these hot objects is that the abundances seen in the hottest object are quite similar to those seen in the temperature regime near g191@xmath1b2b , the prototypical star of this group .",
    "however , it is also clear that the abundances are not identical from object to object .",
    "this variation may well be explained by small differences in  and log g altering the precise balance of the radiative levitation and diffusion processes .",
    "schuh ( 2000 ) has shown that including these effects self - consistently within the model atmosphere calculations can give a good match to the observed euv and uv spectra of several of these stars . however",
    ", this agreement may break down in the hotter objects if a wind is present and schuh s analysis should be extended to pg1342 , rej0558 and rej1738 .",
    "the cooler white dwarfs ( @xmath2k ) can be divided into two broad categories , those where heavy elements ( typically c , n and si , e.g. rej1032 ) are detected and those where the atmospheres seem to be devoid of such material ( e.g. rej2156 ) .",
    "where heavy elements are detected in the far uv , the euv spectra appear to arise from a pure h envelope , indicating that the atmospheres are highly stratified , with the heavy elements residing in the outermost regions ( see holberg _ et  al . _  1995 ,",
    "et  al . _",
    "1999 ) . in the case of one of these stars",
    "( rej1032 ) schuh has demonstrated that the stratification ( and resulting spectra ) is a natural consequence of the balance between radiative levitation and downward gravitation .",
    "however , it is difficult to reconcile this picture with the increasing abundance of n towards lower temperatures in rej1614 and gd659 .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to explain the dramatic difference between objects at similar temperature and gravity , such as rej1032 and rej2156 which has no heavy element content .",
    "one or two objects appear to be anomalous in some way .",
    "while they fit within the broad categories outlined above , the abundance of at least one element is extreme compared to any other object .",
    "for example , the c abundance measured from the _ fuse _  spectrum of pg1342 is by far the greatest value in the entire sample , by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "similarly gd394 contains a si abundance well in excess of any other star . in this case ,",
    "et  al . _  ( 2000 ) have found the star to be peculiar in other ways , exhibiting a 1.15d   euv photometric modulation .",
    "the data suggest that gd394 is accreting material , but a possible source has not yet been identified .",
    "all the above work deals with measured abundance of elements heavier than h or he . however , the absence of he in the hot das remains a mystery .",
    "cspn typically have significant abundances of photospheric he but this seems to disappear before the central star appears as a white dwarf .",
    "one key aim of the stis observations of the hottest white dwarfs was to search for the presence of the heii 1640  in the spectra .",
    "he was not detected in either rej1738 nor rej0558 , but is clearly present in wd2218 + 706 ( figure  2 ) and lies at the photospheric velocity .",
    "the implied abundance of @xmath12 is well below previous optical and uv limits and less than predicted theoretically for = 56900k and log g=6.9 , appropriate for this star .",
    "it is tempting to mark this as the first detection of photospheric he in an isolated hot da ( all other detections appear to be associated with binary systems or possible merged das ) .",
    "however , the gravity is rather low for an isolated star , suggesting a binary origin , even though there is no companion known .",
    "in addition , this star is associated with a known planetary nebula ( deht5 ) .",
    "we have reported a series of systematic abundance measurements for a group of hot da white dwarfs in the temperature range @xmath0k , based on far - uv spectroscopy with stis on _ hst _ , _ iue _  and _ fuse_. using our latest heavy element blanketed non - lte stellar atmosphere calculations we have addressed the heavy element abundance patterns for the hottest stars for the first time , showing that they are similar to objects like g191@xmath1b2b .",
    "the abundances observed in the cooler ( @xmath2k ) white dwarfs are something of a mystery . some of the patterns ( e.g. rej1032 ) can be explained by self - consistent levitation - diffusion calculations but there is then a serious difficulty in understanding the appearance of the apparently pure h atmospheres .",
    "new observations of other stars lying in this temperature range are need to test the self - consistent model calculations .",
    "the work reported in the papers was based on observations made with the _ fuse _  and _ hst _  observatories .",
