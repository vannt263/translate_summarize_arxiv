    "the sector of light scalar mesons has been a topic of intense discussions for years @xcite .",

    "an extensive updated discussion on the issue can be seen in the report @xcite .",
    "the discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite reveal the large amount of empirical information favoring a dynamical picture in which the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons in coupled channels and constraints of unitarity generate scalar mesons , which would qualify as multichannel pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar molecular states .",
    "the successful picture incorporating the constraints of unitarity in coupled channels and the dynamics of the chiral lagrangians @xcite is known as the chiral unitary approach , and either using the inverse amplitude method @xcite or the coupled channels bethe - salpeter equations @xcite , the success in providing an accurate description in the different reactions where these resonances are produced is remarkable .",
    "detailed reviews of such reactions can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite in relation to @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 decays involving these resonances as dynamically generated .",
    "tetraquark pictures have also been invoked @xcite , but the standard configurations chosen to account for the masses , run into one or another problem in different reactions .",
    "a detailed discussion on this issue can be seen in section iv of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "what ultimately sets the balance in favor of one or another theoretical picture is the power to provide an accurate explanation of multiple reactions , and in this sense there is nothing more convincing than making predictions for reactions not yet measured and having the predictions realized a posteriori by experiment .",
    "this is the aim of the present paper where we make predictions for the decay @xmath0 looking into the invariant mass distributions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the distributions",
    "we find a very clear and strong signal for the @xmath7 , and also weaker but clearly seen signals for @xmath5 and @xmath6 excitations .",
    "we are confident on the results up to invariant masses of about 1200 mev and propose the measurement of the reaction that can easily be implemented in besiii .",
    "there is a precedent for the @xmath0 reaction in the @xmath8 decay , which has been measured at besiii ( preliminary results are already available @xcite ) . in this reaction",
    "one can see a neat @xmath7 signal in the @xmath15 mass distribution with its typical cusp shape and with very little background . on the other hand ,",
    "in the @xmath16 mass spectrum one sees a very clear peak for the @xmath5 and a smaller , but visible peak for the @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath16 spectrum also shows a pronounced signal for the @xmath17 excitation .",
    "a theoretical study for this reaction using the chiral unitary approach has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite and a good reproduction of the shapes and relative strengths of the invariant mass distributions was obtained up to about 1200 mev , the present limit of applicability of the chiral unitary approach in the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the @xmath0 has many things in common to the @xmath8 , but also differences .",
    "the @xmath18 has quantum numbers @xmath19 , the @xmath20 has @xmath21 . in the @xmath8 ,",
    "if the @xmath16 is in s - wave to create the @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the @xmath22 must be in p - wave to conserve angular momentum and parity . in the @xmath20 decay",
    "the process can proceed in s - wave . concerning the @xmath17 excitation , in the @xmath8 reaction",
    ", the same process with @xmath22 in p - wave , and the @xmath16 in d - wave , can produce the resonance . in the @xmath0",
    "we will need a d - wave for @xmath22 in the production vertex , in addition to the internal d - wave of @xmath16 .",
    "this mechanism should be suppressed versus the one of @xmath5 or @xmath6 production and then the signals for the scalar mesons would be cleaner than those in the @xmath8 reaction . with this perspective",
    "we perform the calculations and make predictions for the reaction . in the absence of the @xmath17 excitation we also make predictions for the background .",
    "our limitations to the range below 1200 mev for the energies of the interacting meson pairs , induce uncertainties on the background , but we can show that these uncertainties are small in the region of @xmath16 or @xmath15 invariant masses below 1200 mev , thus making our predictions really solid . with these results and clear predictions",
    ", we can only encourage the performance of the experiment which is easily implementable at besiii .",
    "we follow closely the work of @xcite with the particular differences of this case . as commented before , the process proceeds in s - wave .",
    "we consider that @xmath20 behaves as a singlet of su(3 ) , since it does not have @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 quarks and , hence , we must construct an su(3 ) singlet with the product of three pseudoscalars . for this",
    "we write the @xmath9 matrix @xmath26 and we find that @xcite @xmath27    since @xmath28 is already an su(3 ) scalar , the scalar that we can construct from @xmath29 is the trace of @xmath30 , and then @xmath31 = { \\rm trace } [ mmm].\\ ] ]    by writing @xmath32 in terms of the physical mesons with the matrix @xmath33 we have    @xmath34    then we obtain    @xmath35 } & \\equiv { \\rm trace } ( \\phi \\phi \\phi)=\\\\ \\nonumber &    = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3 } } \\eta \\pi^+ \\pi^-     + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3 } } \\eta \\pi^0 \\pi^0     + \\frac{1}{3 \\sqrt{3 } } \\eta \\eta \\eta \\\\ &    + 3 \\pi^+ k^0 k^- + 3 \\pi^- k^+ \\bar k^{0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this expression gives us the relative weights in which trios of pseudoscalars are produced from @xmath20 decay in a first step , prior to the final state interaction of these mesons .    the next step is to allow them to interact . by letting all possible pairs to interact and make transitions , and isolating the final @xmath1 channel , the diagrams to be considered are given in fig .",

    "then the amplitude that sums all terms is given by    @xmath36    where the tree - level amplitude is @xmath37 and the first transition amplitude is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant coefficient , common to all four terms , that accounts for the matrix element of the tree - level @xmath40 mesons transition , up to @xmath41 coefficients , which are the factors multiplying each combination of three mesons in eq .",

    "the @xmath46 and @xmath47 functions , depending on the invariant masses of @xmath16 , @xmath49 , are taken from the chiral unitary approach , and we follow refs .",
    "the factor @xmath50 is a symmetry factor to account for identical particles , @xmath51    similarly , we have @xmath52 where in the sum over @xmath48 we have the states @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and @xmath55 where now in @xmath48 we have @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we take as reference the @xmath16 and @xmath56 invariant masses and write the double differential distribution @xcite    @xmath58    from this formula we obtain @xmath59 and @xmath60 by integrating over the other invariant mass . by labeling 1 , 2 ,",

    "however , this mass is given in terms of the other two variables since one has @xmath71",
    "in fig . [ fig : dalitz ] we show the dalitz plot for @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the @xmath0 decay .",
    "we are interested in @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the region of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "if we take @xmath74 mev we see that @xmath72 goes from 500 - 2300 mev , but the range is similar for values of @xmath73 up to 2400 mev .",
    "this means that the strength of the @xmath14 distribution will be spread along a wide range of @xmath73 and we expect roughly a background following phase space . at @xmath75",
    "mev the range of @xmath72 is reduced to 800 - 1700 mev and we can expect to obtain contribution from the @xmath76 mev region , which we have under control .",
    "altogether we might anticipate that the background below the @xmath7 peak will be moderate and controllable .",
    ", in the @xmath77 and @xmath14 masses.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    if we now fix @xmath72 in 500 - 1000 mev , the range of @xmath73 is large and we should expect a background evenly distributed according to phase space .",
    "however , for @xmath78 mev the range of @xmath73 begins at 1200 mev , thus for these energies we will not have contribution from the large peak of the @xmath7 and the background will be small .    in order to evaluate the differential mass distributions we must bear in mind that the chiral unitary approach that we use only makes reliable predictions up to 1100 - 1200 mev .",
    "one should not use the model for higher invariant masses . with this perspective",
    "we will have to admit uncertainties in the mass distributions , particularly at invariant masses higher than 1200 mev which are a large part of the dalitz plot .",
    "yet , we are only interested in the region of invariant masses below 1200 mev both in @xmath72 and @xmath73 and it is just there where we would like to know uncertainties of our model . for that purpose we take the following prescription : we evaluate @xmath79 combinations up to @xmath80 . from there on we multiply @xmath81 by a smooth factor to make it gradually decrease at large @xmath82 . thus we take @xmath83    we take the values @xmath84 1100 mev and 1150 mev , with @xmath85 0.0037 mev@xmath86 , 0.0054 mev@xmath86 and 0.0077 mev@xmath86 , which reduce @xmath81 by about a factor 3 , 5 and 10 , respectively at @xmath87 mev .",
    "we show the results in figs .",

    "[ 3 ] we show our results for @xmath60 ( the @xmath92 is identical ) .",
    "the results are obtained with @xmath88 mev and the three values of @xmath89 .",
    "what we see is that from 1200 mev on we have appreciable uncertainties , but below this energy , in the region of the @xmath7 the uncertainties are very small , what makes the predictions in that region rather reliable . since the amplitude @xmath93 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) sums coherently all terms , it is interesting to see what is mostly responsible for the peak . for this",
    "we keep in @xmath93 the tree - level amplitude @xmath94 and @xmath69 , since @xmath69 is the term that contains the direct @xmath95 dependence in @xmath96 .",
    "the result obtained with only these two terms are shown in fig . [ 3 ] by the solid line .",
    "this is what we call in the figure , `` no background '' .",
    "we can see that the `` background '' created in that region by the other two terms , @xmath97 and @xmath98 is rather small . yet , in the region from @xmath99 700 mev to 990 mev , this `` background '' reduces a bit the contribution obtained by @xmath100 only .",
    "it is interesting to note that the `` no background '' prescription was taken in @xcite and a smooth background was added incoherently to the @xmath14 mass distributions in the @xmath8 , but not to the @xmath77 mass distribution .",
    "the @xmath7 mass distribution was in quite good agreement with experiment @xcite , but was a bit higher in the @xmath101 mev region , by an amount similar to the difference seen in fig . [ 3 ] between the solid and other curves .",
    "the results obtained here could be easily translated there , with the consequent improvement of the agreement with the data .",
    "similarly , at energies above 1050 mev the `` background '' increases the `` no background '' curve , and this would also help the results of @xcite to get in better agreement with the data of @xcite .",
    "the strong cusp shape of the @xmath7 and the small background , qualify this reaction , together with the @xmath8 , as the reaction where @xmath7 shows up more strongly and more neatly .     as a function of @xmath72 for @xmath88 mev and three different values of @xmath89 .",
    "see text for explanations.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ 4 ] , we show the same results but now @xmath84 1150 mev .",
    "the results are similar and the uncertainties in the region of @xmath102 mev are a bit bigger than before .",
    "what matters for our purpose is that below the @xmath7 region , again the background is small and so are the uncertainties .    in fig . [ 5 ] we present the results with the two @xmath91 values and @xmath103 mev@xmath86 .",
    "we can see better here that the results below 1100 mev are basically the same and not affected by the value chosen for @xmath91 .     for @xmath90 mev.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ 6 ] we show the analogous results of fig . [ 3 ] but for the @xmath104 mass distribution .",
    "we see that taking @xmath84 1100 mev , there are uncertainties in the region of @xmath105 mev for the different values of @xmath89 chosen , but the uncertainties are much smaller in the region below 1200 mev , what makes the predictions done more solid .",
    "it is more interesting to see that we observe a neat signal for the @xmath5 and a much smaller , but clearly visible , signal for the @xmath6 .",
    "we also show the results with `` no background '' obtained taking for @xmath93 the sum @xmath106 , since in @xmath98 we have the terms @xmath107 .",
    "we can see that the `` background '' does not affect the mass distribution below 450 mev , but gives a sizeable contribution from 550 mev to 1200 mev .",
    "once more , in the @xmath8 reaction studied in @xcite , where only the `` no background '' terms were considered , it was found that an `` empirical '' background of this size was needed to reproduce the data of @xcite .",
    "again , all these facts reinforce the reliability of the predictions made here .    in fig .",
    "[ 7 ] we show the results for @xmath84 1150 mev .",
    "they are similar to those of fig . [ 6 ] , with the uncertainties in the region of @xmath108 mev a bit bigger . however , below the @xmath109 mev the results are practically identical .",
    "this is better seen in fig . [ 8 ] , where we show the results for the two values of @xmath91 and @xmath103 mev@xmath86 .",
    "we see indeed , that the region below 1200 mev is not affected by the choice of @xmath91 .",
    "for two different values of @xmath91 and one value of @xmath89.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the results obtained are shown in arbitrary units ( the calculations are done taking a value of @xmath110 ) , however , the relative weights for the @xmath72 and @xmath73 mass distributions of the figures are also predictions that can be tested in actual experiment . as we can see , the strength of the peak of the @xmath7 is about three times the strength of the @xmath5 peak .",
    "we should note that in the region of @xmath72 or @xmath73 above 1200 mev one should expect contribution from other resonances , not accounted for here .",
    "however , the small uncertainties of the spectrum below 1200 mev due to the uncertainties above 1200 mev , indicate that the corrections below 1200 mev due to the contribution of higher energy resonances would still be small .",
    "we have done a theoretical study of the @xmath0 decay paying attention to the final state interaction of the pairs of mesons . we evaluate @xmath59 and @xmath60 and make predictions that should be confronted by a future experiment .",
    "the first step is to see the weight of the possible trios of mesons coming from @xmath20 decay , prior to any final state interaction , which is done assuming that @xmath20 is an su(3 ) singlet and then using su(3 ) symmetry in the trios of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "after that , the interaction of all possible pairs in the trios ( not only @xmath1 ) are allowed to interact , leading to the final @xmath1 .",
    "the calculations are done using the chiral unitary approach for the interaction of mesons , which has a limit of applicability up to @xmath111 mev .",
    "we observe a large and clean signal for the @xmath7 in the @xmath112 mass distribution , and a relatively large signal for @xmath5 and a smaller one for @xmath6 in the @xmath16 mass distribution .    given our ignorance above 1200 mev , we kill gradually the loop functions and amplitudes beyond a @xmath91 around 1200 mev and , with different options , we estimate uncertainties . what we observe in that ,",
    "while uncertainties indeed appear in the region of @xmath113 mev , they are very small below that energy , rendering our predictions rather solid . the shape and strength of the mass distributions , up to a global factor , the same for all of them , are predictions of the theory which could be confronted with experiment",
    ". the ultimate aim would be to provide support to the picture in which the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonances are dynamically generated from the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar interaction .",
    "since neat predictions , more than reproduction of measured data , have a higher value to support one or another picture for the scalar mesons , we encourage both , calculations of the reaction in different models , as well as the performance of the reaction , which in analogy to the @xmath8 already measured at besiii , could be measured in this or other facilities .",
