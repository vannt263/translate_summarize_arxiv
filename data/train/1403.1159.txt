    "a fundamental problem of statistical mechanics is the determination of the phase diagram of interacting many - particle systems in the absence of an external field . for a single - component system of @xmath4 particles in a large region of volume @xmath5 in @xmath6-dimensional euclidean space @xmath7 , the interaction",
    "is represented by the potential energy @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the configurational coordinates .",
    "a theoretically simple and computationally widely used form of the potential energy is the following pairwise form : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an isotropic pair potential and @xmath12 is the distance between the @xmath13th and @xmath14th particles .    even for this simple class of potentials ,",
    "our understanding of the phase diagram , including the @xmath15 ground state , is still far from complete .",
    "two approaches have been used to study phase diagrams of isotropic pair potentials . in the _ forward _ approach , one first specifies the isotropic pair potential @xmath11 and then probes the structures in its phase diagram .",
    "this venerable approach has identified a variety of structures with varying degrees of complexity and order @xcite . in the _ inverse _ approach , a target many - particle configuration or physical property is first specified and then one attempts to determine an isotropic pair potential @xmath11 under certain constraints that achieves the targeted behavior @xcite . the target behavior can be ground state configurations @xcite or excited - state properties , such as negative thermal expansion @xcite and negative poisson ratio @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the use of inverse statistical mechanics to determine isotropic pair potentials that produce unusual targeted crystalline structures as unique ground states , as in multiple previous works @xcite .",
    "contrary to the conventional view that low - coordinated crystal structures require directional bonds as in chemical covalency , earlier works employing the inverse approach have found optimized isotropic pair potentials ( under certain constraints ) stabilizing a variety of low - coordinated crystal structures as ground states .",
    "target structures that have successfully been stabilized include the square lattice @xcite and honeycomb crystal @xcite in two dimensions , and the simple cubic lattice @xcite , diamond crystal @xcite , and wurtzite crystal @xcite in three dimensions .",
    "these isotropic pair potentials have been designed using the following steps @xcite : a functional form was chosen for the isotropic pair potential in terms of some parameters .",
    "one then optimized an objective function that is related to the stability of the target structure over competitors ( for example , energy difference @xcite or the target structure s stable pressure range @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , the validity of the optimized potential was verified by cooling liquid configurations to absolute zero temperature via simulated annealing and by establishing that the target structure contains no phonon instabilities @xcite .",
    "these results provide good counterexamples to the aforementioned intuition that low - coordinated structures require directional bonding .",
    "however , all of these target structures are globally highly symmetric , and the local environments around each of the particles in these structures are identical up to spatial inversions or rotations .    here",
    ", we further probe the limitations of isotropic pair potentials to produce ground - state structural extremes using inverse statistical - mechanical techniques .",
    "doing so has required us to improve upon previous optimization algorithms devised for inverse statistical mechanics for reasons that we will elaborate below .",
    "our improved optimization algorithm not only allows each competitor structure to deform to become more competitive during the optimization , but also incorporates the local mechanical stability of the target structure ( i.e. enthalpy cost to deform the target structure ) into our objective function .",
    "we test our improved optimization algorithm by targeting the standard kagome crystal , rectangular lattices , the rectangular kagome crystal , and the three dimensional caf@xmath3 crystal inhabited by a single particle species . compared to previous target structures ,",
    "these new targets have lower symmetry , and particles in some cases have different local structural environments .",
    "we restrict ourselves to short - ranged potentials ( i.e. @xmath16 for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a constant ) because they are both computationally easier to treat and experimentally simpler to realize . for all of our targets , except for the rectangular kagome crystal , we are able to stabilize them with smooth short - ranged monotonic repulsive potentials , which would be easier to produce experimentally . for the rectangular kagome crystal , we found that a potential with a shallow well is needed for the class of functions considered .",
    "in contrast to some previous inverse statistical mechanical approaches @xcite , in which the specific volume @xmath19 ( @xmath4 is the number of particles and @xmath5 is the volume ) is fixed and the classical ground state is achieved by the global minimum of the potential energy @xmath8 , we fix the pressure @xmath20 rather than the specific volume . at constant pressure @xmath20 and number of particles",
    "@xmath4 , the classical ground state is achieved by the global minimum of the configurational enthalpy per particle : @xmath21 there are two advantages to fixing the pressure rather than the specific volume .",
    "first , at zero temperature , phase separation ( coexistence ) only occurs at a unique pressure for a given potential , while it can occur over a nontrivial range of densities . by fixing the pressure rather than the density during simulations ,",
    "we minimize our risk of encountering phase separation .",
    "second , allowing the volume to change will enable us to fully deform the simulation box , thus minimizing the boundary effect during simulations .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "a _ lattice _ in @xmath7 is an infinite periodic structure in which the space @xmath7 is divided into identical regions called _ fundamental cells _ , each of which contains just one point specified by the _ lattice vector _ @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the lattice vectors and @xmath24 spans all the integers for @xmath25 .",
    "crystal _ is a more general notion than a lattice because it is obtained by placing a fixed configuration of @xmath26 points ( where @xmath27 ) , located at @xmath28 , within one fundamental cell .",
    "the coordination structure of a crystal can be represented by the theta series @xmath29 @xcite , which is the generating function of squared distances of the vector displacements between any two particles of the crystal structure and has the following form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance from a particle at the origin ( measured in units of the nearest neighbor distance ) and @xmath32 is the associated average coordination number ( average number of particles at a radial distance @xmath31 ) .",
    "see appendix  [ targets_structure ] for the vectors that specify the particle locations and lattice vectors of the crystal as well as the first few terms of the corresponding theta series of our target structures .",
    "for the special case of periodic structures , eq .",
    "( [ enthalpy_def ] ) can be written more explicitly in terms of coordination structure : @xmath33 where @xmath34^t$ ] is the generator matrix @xcite ( a matrix whose rows consist of the lattice vectors ) and @xmath35 is the specific volume , which depends on @xmath36 .",
    "the ground state is achieved by the global minimum of enthalpy per particle @xmath37 .    for each target crystal structure , we use the following steps to attempt to find an isotropic pair potential @xmath11 and a pressure @xmath20 such that the target is the ground state",
    ".      a target configuration can not possibly be the unique ground state if a different structure has exactly the same coordination structure up to the range of the potential and the same specific volume @xmath38 . in this degeneracy searching step , we start from a random configuration and minimize the `` difference '' between the coordination structure of the configuration and that of the target structure ; see appendix  [ coordination_difference ] for a detailed description . after minimizing the difference , if there is no difference between the two coordination structures and specific volumes , we check if the resulting configuration is equivalent to the target structure . two structures are considered to be `` equivalent '' if they are related to each other through translations , rotations , inversions , uniform scalings , or combinations of the above transformations @xcite . if the resulting configuration is different from the target structure , then we have found a degenerate structure and thus have proven that the target structure can not be the unique ground state of any isotropic pair potential .",
    "if after trying to minimize the difference multiple times ( often thousands of times ) no degenerate structure is found , we tentatively assume that the target structure is unique and continue to the next step . in this step ,",
    "we visually inspect the configurations to determine whether two structures are equivalent .",
    "however , in the upcoming optimization and verification steps , since we have already assumed that the target structure has a unique coordination structure , we can test whether another structure is equivalent to the target structure by comparing their coordination structures using the computer .",
    "if the target structure has a unique coordination structure , it might be stabilized by an isotropic pair potential with finite range .",
    "we can specify a family of potential functions and optimize for the target structure s stability .",
    "since extremely long - ranged potentials are both computationally inefficient and experimentally challenging to realize , we restrict ourselves to potential functions with compact support of the following form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are parameters .",
    "this form is realistic because it contains a stiff core @xmath45 and smoothly approaches zero as @xmath46 approaches @xmath43 . if this form does not work well",
    ", we will add additional terms of different types , for example , gaussian wells centered at some @xmath47 . since the energy and length scale of the pair potential are arbitrary , we fix these scales so that :    1 .",
    "the nearest neighbor distance of the target structure is 1 . 2 .",
    "the absolute value of the pair potential at the nearest neighbor distance of the target structure , @xmath48 , is 1 .",
    "we also require that @xmath49 so that the effect of the gaussian core is to decrease @xmath11 as @xmath46 increases rather than to increase @xmath11 .",
    "we further require that @xmath50 in order to ensure that the potential is relatively short - ranged .",
    "after the potential form is chosen , we optimize the parameters . although previous objective functions worked for previous target structures with high symmetry , they must be modified for less symmetric and more complex target structures .",
    "the result of maximizing the energy difference or enthalpy difference is very sensitive to structurally close competitors ( i.e. a slight deformation of the target structure ) because they are not differentiated from structurally remote competitors ( competitors that are not structurally close competitors ) .",
    "figure  [ closecompetitorproblem ] illustrates the close - competitor problem schematically .     as the enthalpy difference between the target and the lowest competitor and",
    "maximize it , we will encounter the `` close - competitor problem . ''",
    "if the competitor list contains structurally close competitors , @xmath51 will be controlled by a structurally close competitor , causing an abnormal lifting of the enthalpy of structurally close competitors .",

    "( a ) : if the target structure is not a local minimum of the enthalpy surface , the inherent structure of the target will not be identical to the target and will have a lower enthalpy .",
    "@xmath51 becomes negative .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) : if the target structure is a local minimum of the enthalpy surface , the inherent structure of the target will be identical to the target .",
    "@xmath51 becomes the enthalpy difference between the target and a different inherent structure .",
    "thus @xmath51 might be positive .",
    "( b ) : however , after maximizing @xmath51 , the curvature near the target structure might be very small , leading to an undesirable phonon spectrum .",
    "( c ) : by maximizing @xmath52 , we sacrifice some @xmath51 to increase the curvature near the target structure while favoring short - ranged potentials .",
    "note that we usually can not find all inherent structures in the complex , multi - dimensional enthalpy surface .",
    "if we miss a inherent structure that has a lower enthalpy than our target , that inherent structure will be discovered in the later verification step by simulated annealing .",
    ", width=604 ]    optimization over a pressure range solves the close competitor problem @xcite , but introduces its own problems .",
    "first , some structures with lower symmetry do not naturally have a stable pressure range .",
    "for example , consider the rectangular lattice with aspect ratio @xmath53 .",
    "( a precise definition of rectangular lattices and their aspect ratio is given in appendix  [ targets_structure ] . ) since the structure is anisotropic , it is expected to have different elastic constants in different directions ; see appendix  [ elasticconstants ] for examples .",
    "thus , when the pressure is changed by a small amount , the aspect ratio will also change .",
    "second , after the optimization , there will be many competitors that are enthalpically close to the target",
    ". however , these competitor structures can be very different from the target , and converting from one to another may require crossing a large enthalpy barrier .",
    "this makes it especially hard to find the ground state in the later simulated annealing step .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an improved objective function that removes these shortcomings , enabling us to target ground - state structures with considerably greater complexity than previous targets .",
    "the improved objective function of the optimization is calculated by the following steps :    1 .",
    "given a set of potential function parameters , an isotropic pair potential @xmath11 is determined .",
    "using this potential function , we calculate the pressure of the target structure ( knowing that the nearest neighbor distance of the target structure is 1 ) . for this pressure , we find the inherent structure of the target structure and each competitor structure .",
    "the inherent structures are obtained by minimizing the enthalpy per particle @xmath37 in the isobaric ensemble , changing particle positions @xmath54 and lattice vectors @xmath36 . in the current implementation ,",
    "the minimizations are performed with the minop algorithm @xcite .",
    ", we compare each of the inherent structures with the target structure to test if they are structurally equivalent .",
    "3 .   for each inherent structure that is not equivalent to the target",
    ", we calculate its enthalpy per particle @xmath55 . after calculating all the @xmath55 s",
    ", we find their minimum value , @xmath56 .",
    "the difference between @xmath56 and the enthalpy per particle of the target structure is : @xmath57 4 .",
    "having @xmath58 will establish the target as the ground state .",
    "however , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ potentialsurface_cartoon ] , @xmath51 does not reflect the enthalpy cost to deform the target structure .",
    "thus , optimizing for @xmath51 can lead to undesirable phonon spectra . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we incorporate quantities that enable us to modify the second derivative of the enthalpy around the target structure . for a fixed @xmath26 ,",
    "the enthalpy per particle @xmath37 is a function of particle positions and lattice vectors .",
    "the hessian matrix of this function is calculated and its lowest non - zero eigenvalue , @xmath1 , is calculated .",
    "( in @xmath6 dimensions , the matrix has @xmath59 zero - valued eigenvalues corresponding to the translation of particles and the rotation of the fundamental cell . )",
    "maximizing @xmath1 will improve phonon stability .",
    "we also want to favor the smallest possible potential cut - off distance @xmath18 . therefore",
    ", we choose to maximize the objective function @xmath52 , where @xmath60 is proportional to the volume of the influence sphere of the potential . to sum up ,",
    "the optimization problem is specified by the following description : @xmath61    having defined the objective function , we use an optimizer to maximize it .",
    "we employ the optimizer to evaluate this objective function thousands of times using different parameters .",
    "note that each objective function evaluation requires multiple inherent structure calculations .",
    "when optimizing for this objective function , the success rate can be low .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that the objective function is neither differentiable nor continuous .",
    "we found that the nonlinear `` subplex '' optimization algorithm @xcite is relatively robust in optimizing this objective function .",
    "however , we usually still need to implement the optimization hundreds of times starting from different , random sets of parameters to ensure that we obtain the best solution in a computationally feasible way . to relieve the problem ,",
    "we optimize for the local stability of the target structure before optimizing for the above mentioned objective function .",
    "more precisely , we find target structure s inherent structure ( which is the target structure itself if the target structure is locally stable ) , calculate the coordination structures of the target structure and its inherent structure , and minimize the difference between the two coordination structures .      after the optimization step",
    ", we cool , via simulated annealing , liquid configurations of particles interacting with the putative optimized potential to absolute zero temperature to verify that the target is indeed the ground state .",
    "to increase computational efficiency , we use relatively small systems ( 1 to 24 particles ) in a fully deformable simulation box under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we also use the thermodynamic cooling schedule , which is given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) of ref .  .",
    "in this step , if we discover new structures that are more stable ( i.e. , have a lower enthalpy ) than the target structure , we add them to the competitor list and return to step  c. if we can not find any competitor and can find the target structure multiple times ( 10 times in the current implementation ) , then the target structure is deemed to be the ground state of the optimized potential .",
    "we finally check the result by calculating the target structure s phonon spectrum and ensure that all of the phonon frequencies are real .",

    "while rigorous answers to these questions are beyond the scope of the present paper , we can offer some general principles that may provide guidance in determining whether certain target structures can be achieved as ground states by a particular class of radial pair potentials .",

    "for example , the diamond crystal has been stabilized with both a monotonic potential @xcite and a potential with wells @xcite .    concerning the second question",
    ", the minimum range of the pair potential varies for different targets , but is usually comparable to the longest diagonal length of the fundamental cell @xmath120 of the target crystal .",
    "it seems that in order for the particles to self - assemble into the target crystal , the pair potential only needs to encode coordination information within a range comparable in size to the fundamental cell ( since the crystal is the replication of the fundamental cell under periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "for certain relatively symmetric target structures , the fundamental cell consists of particle subsets that differ only by translations , rotations , and inversions .",
    "thus , the pair potentials for these targets may only require a cut - off distance @xmath18 that is shorter than the longest diagonal of the fundamental cell .",
    "examples include our kagome and caf@xmath3 potentials , a previously designed body - centered - cubic potential @xcite , and a kagome potential found with the forward approach @xcite . for certain relatively challenging target such as",
    "the rectangular kagome crystal ( it is challenging because of the reasons explained in sec .",
    "[ result_reckagome ] ) , the range of the potential can be somewhat longer than the longest diagonal of the fundamental cell .",
    "in fact , the length and symmetry of the fundamental cell are the most important factors determining the required range of the potential .",
    "this is demonstrated by the caf@xmath3 crystal inhabited by a single particle species , which is symmetric but challenging ( because it contains particles in different local environments ) .",
    "the optimized potential that we have obtained here contains a relatively high - order polynomial , but its range is surprisingly short .",
    "table  [ cut - off2 ] summarizes the minimal cut - off distance @xmath18 that we found for the targets considered in this paper . to further support the notion that the minimal potential cut - off distance @xmath18 need only be comparable in size to the longest diagonal of the fundamental cell , we have also generated short - ranged isotropic pair potentials using our algorithm for several other simpler targets . except for the fcc crystal ,",
