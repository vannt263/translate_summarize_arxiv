    "stochastic evolution equations have been an active area of research for many years .",
    "there are two main approaches in the study of nonlinear stochastic evolution equations .",
    "first studies equations of type @xmath0 in a hilbert space where @xmath1 is the infinitesimal generator of a @xmath2 semigroup of linear operators , @xmath3 is a wiener process or more generally a martingale and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are assumed to be lipschitz . among studies taking this approach one can note da prato and zabczyk  @xcite , in which the existence and uniqueness of the mild solution for stochastic evolution equations with wiener noise is proved as well as kotelenez  @xcite in which the general martingale noise is considered .",
    "the second approach considers equations of type @xmath6 in a hilbert space @xmath7 equipped with a banach space @xmath8 with dense embeddings @xmath9 , where @xmath3 is a wiener process with values in a hilbert space and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are generally assumed to be unbounded nonlinear operators that satisfy certain monotonicity and coercivity properties .",
    "this approach is called the variational method . among studies in this framework",
    "one can note pardoux  @xcite , krylov and rozovskii  @xcite , liu and rckner  @xcite and rckner  @xcite .",
    "as one typical example of spde with this approach , the stochastic porous media equation has been studied by barbu , da prato and rckner  @xcite .",
    "each of these two approaches are stochastic versions of well known deterministic methods in nonlinear analysis .",
    "another deterministic method is the semigroup approach to semilinear evolution equations with monotone nonlinearities , and it first appeared in the works of browder  @xcite and kato  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been generalized to stochastic evolution equations in zangeneh  @xcite and  @xcite to study equations of the type @xmath12 where @xmath3 is a wiener process and @xmath4 has a monotonicity assumption , i.e. there exists a real constant @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "we call such @xmath4 a",
    "_ semimonotone _ operator . in the case",
    "that @xmath15 , @xmath4 is called a _ monotone",
    "_ operator .",
    "monotone operators are also called _ dissipative _ operators in the literature and they are generalizations of decreasing real functions . every operator of the form @xmath16 where @xmath5 is monotone and @xmath17 is lipschitz , is a semimonotone operator and vice versa .",
    "hence this approach is a generalization of the first approach .",
    "this generalization is useful since there are natural semimonotone functions which are not lipschitz ; examples include decreasing real functions , such as @xmath18{x}$ ] , or sum of a non differentiable decreasing function with a lipschitz function .",
    "figure  [ figure : semimonotone ] shows a semimonotone real function .",
    "[ figure : semimonotone ]     the semigroup approach to semilinear stochastic evolution equations with monotone nonlinearities also has an advantage to the variational method since it does not require the coercivity property .",
    "there are important examples , such as stochastic partial differential equations of hyperbolic type with monotone nonlinear terms , for which the generator does not satisfy the coercivity property and hence the variational method is not applicable directly to these equations .",
    "pardoux  @xcite has developed a new theory to apply the variational method to the second order hyperbolic equations . but as is shown in example  [ example : second_order_hyperbolic ] , this problem can be treated directly in our setting .",
    "another advantage of the semigroup approach to semilinear stochastic evolution equations with monotone nonlinearities is that it allows a unified treatment of different problems , such as stochastic partial differential equations of hyperbolic and parabolic type and stochastic delay differential equations .",
    "there are a number of papers that have considered monotone ( dissipative ) nonlinearities but they assume the special case of additive white noise , see e.g da prato and rckner  @xcite .",
    "the general case of multiplicative white noise has been considered by zangeneh  @xcite and existence and uniqueness of the mild solution has been proved .",
    "jahanipur and zangeneh  @xcite has derived sufficient conditions for exponential asymptotic stability of solutions of  .",
    "jahanipur  @xcite considered stochastic delay evolution equations and proved existence and stability of mild solutions .",
    "jahanipur  @xcite generalized the results to stochastic functional evolution equations with coefficients depending on the past path of the solution .",
    "hamedani and zangeneh  @xcite considered a stopped version of   and proved existence and uniqueness of the solution using a stopped maximal inequality for @xmath19-th moment of stochastic convolution integrals , which they proved in  @xcite .",
    "dadashi and zangeneh  @xcite studied the large deviation principle for  . zamani and zangeneh",
    "@xcite studied a limiting problem of such equations arising from random motion of highly elastic strings .",
    "finally , zangeneh  @xcite studied the stationarity of a mild solution to a stochastic evolution equation with monotone nonlinear drift .    in recent years",
    "some research has appeared on stochastic evolution equations with lvy noise which use the first and second approaches above , see e.g. peszat and zabczyk  @xcite , albeverio , mandrekar and rdiger  @xcite and marinelli , prvt and rckner  @xcite for the case of lipschitz coefficients and brzeniak , liu and zhu  @xcite for coercive and monotone coefficients .",
    "there are a number of works that have considered monotone ( dissipative ) coefficients but they assume the special case of additive lvy noise , see e.g peszat and zabczyk  @xcite and albeverio , mastrogiacomo and smii  @xcite .",
    "we should also mention the article by marinelli and rckner  @xcite which considers dissipative nonlinear drift and multiplicative lvy noise but only the uniqueness of the mild solution is proved there . as far as we know ,",
    "the existence and continuity of the mild solution with respect to initial conditions for equations with monotone nonlinear drift and multiplicative lvy noise has not been studied before .    in this article",
    "we are concerned with the equation @xmath20 where @xmath3 is a cylindrical wiener process on a hilbert space @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a compensated poisson random measure .",
    "we assume @xmath4 is semimonotone and @xmath5 and @xmath23 are lipschitz . in section  [ section : problem ]",
    "the assumptions on coefficients are stated precisely .",
    "we prove the existence and uniqueness of the mild solution in theorem  [ theorem : existence and uniqueness ] in section  [ section : existence and uniqueness ] .",
    "the continuity of the solution with respect to initial conditions and coefficients will be proved in theorem  [ theorem : continuity i ] in section  [ section : continuity with respect to parameter ] and a sufficient condition for the exponential stability of the solutions will be derived in corollary  [ theorem : exponential stability ] .",
    "section  [ section : markov property ] is devoted to proving the markov property of the solutions .",
    "some of the statements have been published previously in  @xcite , but the proofs were just outlined .    our method in proving",
    "the existence of the solution is a certain iterative method that is specific to this type of equations .",
    "the main tool in our study is an it type inequality that gives a pathwise bound for the norm of stochastic convolution integrals , which has been proved in  @xcite and will be stated in section  [ section : stochastic convolution integrals ] . since the usual inequalities for stochastic convolution integrals are not applicable to our equation , the so called inequality plays a central role in our study .    in the last section we will provide some concrete examples that our results could apply .",
    "the examples consist of a stochastic delay differential equation and three semilinear stochastic partial differential equations .",
