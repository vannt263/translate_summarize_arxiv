    "during the processes , a part of the rotation - energy flux of a neutron star @xmath6 converts to the particle kinetic energy flux .",
    "the primary particles which are significantly accelerated by the electric field emit the curvature radiation , and the created secondary ( and higher generation ) pairs with non - zero pitch angle emit synchrotron radiation .",
    "thus , observations of pulsed emissions provide the location of particle acceleration and particle creation , and the efficiency of the energy conversion to the particle energy .",
    "pulsed emission in gev @xmath0-ray band is an important tool for probing the particle acceleration in the magnetosphere .",
    "gev @xmath0-ray emission is detected in young pulsars with characteristic age @xmath7 yr , except for millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "the emission mechanism is considered as the curvature radiation from the primary particles . since the gev spectrum observed by _",
    "show that the cutoffs are more gradual than exponential @xcite , the emission comes from the outer region of the magnetosphere such as the outer gap model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observed cutoff energy is distributed around @xmath8 gev @xcite , which provides the energy of the accelerated particles .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray luminosity roughly seems to follow the trend @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the trend is expected in models that the @xmath0-ray luminosity is simply proportional to the gj current @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath0-ray observations provide the constraints on the energy conversion efficiency and the location of the particle acceleration , the information could be inadequate to understand the particle acceleration for the whole population of rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "since gev @xmath0-ray emissions are detected from only young pulsars , the efficiency of energy conversion is less constrained for older , non-@xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "it is difficult to obtain the reliable value of the @xmath0-ray luminosity of the @xmath0-ray pulsars that are not detected in radio because of the uncertain distance from the observer .",
    "in addition , the energy conversion efficiency may be underestimated by only @xmath0-ray observations because of the pair creation process .",
    "for example , the inner accelerator could also work to supply huge number of pairs required in the observations of pulsar wind nebulae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0-ray photons from the inner region are significantly absorbed via magnetic ( b@xmath0 ) pair creation process , so that total energy flux radiated in @xmath0-ray is larger than that estimated from the @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "the non - thermal pulsed emissions are also detected in lower energy bands such as x - ray and optical bands .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray luminosity seems to follow the relation @xmath10 with @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , although scatter about the relation is significant @xcite .",
    "critical lines below which all the data locates on @xmath12 versus @xmath6 plane are empirically suggested @xcite , although the physical mechanism of the restriction of x - ray luminosity is unknown .",
    "the non - thermal optical luminosity also seems to depend on the spin - down luminosity in a manner similar to the x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the emission mechanism for both x - ray and optical bands is widely believed as the synchrotron radiation from the secondary ( and higher generation ) particles ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray and optical emissions , and the combination with @xmath0-ray observations provide valuable information about the particle acceleration .",
    "in contrast to gev @xmath0-ray , the x - ray and optical emissions are detected even from old pulsars whose ages are up to @xmath13 yr @xcite .",
    "a photon whose energy is much less than a electron rest mass energy is not absorbed via the magnetic pair creation process .",
    "then , we can detect the x - ray and optical emissions even if their emission regions reside at the inner region of the magnetosphere .",
    "these emissions provide the energy flux of secondary particles created in the magnetosphere for almost all pulsars .",
    "since @xmath0-ray , x - ray and optical emitting particles are related through a pair cascade process , if the @xmath0-ray emission is detected , their flux ratios which do not depend on the distance are useful to understand the pair cascade process in the magnetosphere .",
    "one of the reasons for the investigation of the energy conversion for old pulsars and the comparison with that for young pulsars is that some of old pulsars have intensity and pulse profile modulations such as nulling and mode changing in radio observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of these modulated pulsars significantly increases from their characteristic age @xmath14 yr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is unknown whether the characteristic age is a control parameter for the modulation phenomena or not .",
    "recently , the correlation between the state changes of radio emission and the change of braking properties have been discovered @xcite .",
    "this correlation suggests that the modulation phenomena are linked and caused by the change of the magnetospheric state .",
    "moreover , the synchronous radio and x - ray switching between two modes was also reported @xcite . therefore , the differences of the location of the x - ray emission region and the energy conversion efficiency between young and old pulsars give hints to understand such modulation phenomena .    recently ,",
    "enegy dissipation in the magnetosphere has been investigated by numerical simulations such as dissipative magnetohydrodynamic approaches @xcite and global particle - in - cell simulations @xcite .",
    "their results indicate that most particle acceleration takes place in the current sheet close behind the light cylinder @xcite .",
    "the x - ray and optical synchrotron radiations from pairs in the current sheet have been discussed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the x - ray and optical emissions would provide valuable constraints on the current sheet emitting scenario .    in this paper , using the analytical model",
    ", we calculate the luminosity of the synchrotron radiation as the emission mechanism of the non - thermal x - ray and optical bands .",
    "we parameterize the efficiency of energy conversion from the spin - down luminosity to the energy flux of primary particles .",
    "we are interested in the efficiency of the energy conversion and the emission region in whole population including @xmath0-ray detected pulsars ( @xmath7 yr ) and old pulsars ( @xmath14 yr ) . in @xmath0-ray pulsars , pair creation occurs at the outer magnetosphere via two - photon collision ( @xmath15 ) . as pulsar gets old , it is suggested that @xmath15 pair creation becomes ineffective at the outer magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider two pair creation processes , b@xmath0 and @xmath15 pair creations . in previous study @xcite",
    ", we assume that the energy of the primary particles equals to the maximum potential drop across the polar cap . using this assumption ,",
    "we avoid assuming the value of accelerating electric field which is highly uncertain . for young pulsars ,",
    "the characteristic energy of the curvature radiation from such primary particles is much higher than the observed cutoff energy . here",
    ", we use the typical value of the observed cutoff energy in gev @xmath0-ray band to derive the energy of primary particles in @xmath15 pair creation case . in b@xmath0 pair creation case",
    ", we use the maximum potential drop across the polar cap to derive the energy of primary particles .",
    "note that in this case , the results do not depend on the energy of primary particles in our model . in section [ sec : model ] , we describe our model for the radiative transfer and the luminosity of the synchrotron radiation . in section [ sec : results ] , we provide the luminosity of the synchrotron radiation as a function of the efficiency of the energy conversion for each pair creation case .",
    "we also provide the allowed range of the emission region of the synchrotron radiation in x - ray and optical bands .",
    "discussion is presented in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we consider synchrotron radiation emitted from created pairs via @xmath15 or b@xmath0 pair creation process in the magnetosphere . in this paper",
    ", we use the term ` primary particles ' as electrons or positrons that are accelerated in the magnetosphere and emit curvature photons whose energy is high enough to convert pairs . we also use ` secondary particles ' as electrons and positrons created outside of the acceleration region and emit synchrotron radiation . since we are interested in particles which emit the synchrotron radiation , ` secondary particles ' include second and higher generation particles which could emit synchrotron radiation .    in our model , we make three main assumptions that ( a ) the physical quantities at the regions of the particle acceleration , creation and emission are described as a function of the radius @xmath16 from the centre of the neutron star to the radius of the light cylinder @xmath17 , ( b ) the energy source is only the rotational energy of a neutron star and other sources such as the magnetic field dissipation do not contribute to the particle energy flux , and ( c ) the dipole component of the magnetic field dominates near the light cylinder , where the radius of the light cylinder is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the speed of light .",
    "note that although we only consider the region inside the light cylinder as in assumption ( a ) , the model with @xmath20 is applicable to the the case where significant dissipation of poynting flux takes place close behind the light cylinder ( @xmath21 ) as indicated by recent global models @xcite .",
    "moreover , the synchrotron luminosity becomes maximum at @xmath22 if our model extends outside the light cylinder as discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] . from assumption ( b ) , the total energy flux of primary particles is limited by the spin - down luminosity .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless conversion efficiency @xmath23 from the spin - down luminosity @xmath6 to the energy flux of the primary particles as a model parameter ( see also equation [ dotn_p ] ) .",
    "the radius , mass and dipole magnetic moment of a neutron star are @xmath24 cm , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively , where @xmath27 is moment of inertia . for the @xmath15 pair creation process , we consider the thermal x - ray photons from the heated polar cap as the seed photons to create the secondary pairs , while we neglect the thermal photons from the entire surface and the synchrotron photons .",
    "this is reasonable approximation except for very young pulsar such as the crab pulsar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the synchrotron luminosity in ingoing case , where synchrotron emitting pairs are created by the curvature photons emitted by the ingoing primary particles , is lower than the luminosity in outgoing case as shown in previous studies @xcite .",
    "we only consider the synchrotron radiation from pairs created by the curvature photons emitted by the outgoing primary particles .",
    "we consider two pair creation processes , @xmath15 and b@xmath0 pair creations , separately .",
    "the schematic pictures of two scenarios are shown in figure [ image ] . in @xmath15 pair creation scenario ( upper panel ) , the curvature photons ( blue arrow ) collide with the thermal photons ( green arrow ) from the heated polar cap .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that we can easily estimate the optical depth for @xmath15 pair creation .",
    "since the optical depth for the propagation of curvature photons is typically much lower than unity ( see section [ sec : luminosity ] ) at the outer magnetosphere , most curvature photons escape from the magnetosphere .",
    "these pulsars are detected as @xmath0-ray pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "except for the synchrotron radiation , inverse compton scattering may work to contribute to the observed non - thermal emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the non - resonant compton scattering , the efficiency should be low because of the small value of the optical depth as seen in @xmath15 scenario . in the case of resonant compton scattering ,",
