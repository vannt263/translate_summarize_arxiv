    "the universal features of turbulent 2d flows are determined by the time invariant probability measures carried by the global attractor @xmath2 of the 2d navier - stokes equations(nse ) @xcite .",
    "some of these features involve the time average of energy per unit mass @xmath3 , enstrophy per unit mass @xmath4 , and palinstrophy per unit mass @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the study of the triplet @xmath6 , associated with a solution @xmath7 , for all @xmath8 , is of intrinsic interest .",
    "a question which arises naturally in this context is whether the past ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) of @xmath10 is sufficient to uniquely determine the solution @xmath11 for all @xmath8 . a particularly intriguing version of this problem was considered in @xcite , namely , whether or not it is possible for @xmath12 , corresponding to a nonstationary solution @xmath11 , with @xmath13 , for all @xmath8 , to be constant in time . in this paper",
    ", we continue the study of such solutions , which were called ghost solutions in @xcite . we assume , as in @xcite , that the force @xmath14 is an eigenvector of the stokes operator @xmath15 , namely , @xmath16 , where , @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 the period . in the case",
    "@xmath20 , the global attractor @xmath2 is reduced to a single point ( see @xcite ) , hence there are no ghost solutions .",
    "one interesting feature of ghost solutions is that , with only one exception , the scalar products of any two different terms in the functional form of the nse are constants in time . in order to extract geometric properties from this feature ,",
    "we introduce two different reference frames that are rigidly carried by the solutions .",
    "we first define a moving reference frame consisting of four orthonormal functions in the real separable hilbert phase space @xmath21",
    ". then we project each term of the nse onto the reference frame .",
    "the stokes operator @xmath15 and the inertial term in the nse can be represented by a symmetric positive definite matrix and by a tensor , respectively .",
    "it turns out that with two possible exceptions , the coordinates of these above specified projections are constant in time .",
    "moreover , we find there is an unitary transformation between any two ghost solutions . however , if either a sequence of ghost solutions converge to a stationary solution , or a ghost solution converges to a fixed point when @xmath22 , this reference frame loses stability and degenerates to a three dimensional frame .",
    "this kind of instability problem is avoided by introducing another reference frame . for the new reference frame ,",
    "the degeneracy problem occurs only when there exist some @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 .",
    "denote the set of these @xmath25 s as @xmath26 .",
    "we show that if the set @xmath26 has an accumulation point , then the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are all constants in time . for convenience ,",
    "if a ghost solution satisfies the relation @xmath29 , for all @xmath23 , and for some time independent coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , we will call it chained .",
    "it can be shown that any chained ghost solution @xmath11 will be a sum of three components .",
    "one component is a scalar multiple of @xmath14 , and the other two @xmath33 , @xmath34 are eigenvectors of @xmath15 , namely , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it turns out that numerically finding a possible chained ghost solution is equivalent to solving a galerkin system of a particular form .    in the particular case @xmath38",
    ", we can show that @xmath39 and @xmath40 . and as a consequence , we prove that there is no chained ghost solutions . in the process of proving this result ,",
    "we show that the chained ghost solutions in this case , if they existed , must project only on a small portion of a parabolic curve in the @xmath41-plane .",
    "then , a careful exploitation of the interaction between the wave numbers and active modes in this galerkin system leads to several useful annihilations that allow us to show that there do not exist chained ghost solutions .",
    "this , in turn , guarantees the stability of the new reference frame .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives the background and settings for our discussion . in section 3 ,",
    "we present some inequalities which are necessary later and also recall some results from @xcite . in section 4 , the geometric structure associated with a ghost solution",
    "is constructed , as is a unitary transformation between two ghost solutions .",
    "section 5 shows that the closure of @xmath42 in @xmath43 is the union of @xmath44 and a set of all stationary solutions .",
    "section 6 describes the geometric behavior of chained ghost solutions in detail . in section 7 , a particular galerkin method for finding a possible chained ghost is given .",
    "section 8 has the proof that there do not exist chained ghost solutions in the case when @xmath45 .",
    "in this paper , we consider the following imcompressible navier - stokes equations ( nse ) in @xmath46 ^ 2 $ ] @xmath47 where @xmath0 is the velocity of fluid at time @xmath25 , at point @xmath48 ; @xmath49 and @xmath50 are unknown , @xmath51-periodic functions , and @xmath52 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "@xmath19 is the period , @xmath50 is the pressure , and @xmath53 is the `` body '' force as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the real separable hilbert space @xmath54 is formed by the set of all @xmath55-valued functions @xmath56 , which has the fourier expansion @xmath57 + where @xmath58 and @xmath59 , for all @xmath60 , satisfying @xmath61 @xmath62 for all @xmath63 , and @xmath64 the scalar product in @xmath54 is taken to be the usual @xmath65 ^ 2$]-product @xmath66 denote by @xmath15 the stokes operator , which is the linear map defined by @xmath67 where @xmath68 it is well known that the operator @xmath15 is self - adjoint , with a compact inverse @xmath69 , and the specturm ( cf .",

    "the functional form then becomes @xmath94 after dropping the tildes .    also , recall the following form of navier - stokes equation in terms of the fouier series coefficients , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is given in ( [ coef_for_b ] ) . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that @xmath97 since for eigenvector @xmath14 of stokes operator @xmath15 , we have @xmath98 , whose proof can be found in appendix b of @xcite .",
    "this yields that there exists @xmath99 that satisfies @xmath100 , the stationary nse . for @xmath101 , see @xcite .",
    "then , the energy and enstropy balances are @xmath102 @xmath103      we recall that the global attractor @xmath2 of the nse is the collection of all elements @xmath104 in @xmath21 for which there exists a solution @xmath11 of nse , for all @xmath105 , such that @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "to give another definition of @xmath2 , we need to recall several concepts .",
    "first , as is well - known , for any @xmath108 , there exists a unique continuous function @xmath49 from @xmath109 to @xmath21 such that @xmath106 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath49 satisfies the nse for all @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , one can define the map @xmath113 by @xmath114 where @xmath115 is as above .",
    "since @xmath116 , the family @xmath117 is called the  solution \" semigroup . furthermore , a compact set @xmath118 is called absorbing if for any bounded set @xmath119 there is a time @xmath120 such that @xmath121 for all @xmath122 .",
    "the attractor can be now defined by the formula @xmath123 where @xmath118 is any compact absorbing subset of @xmath21 .",
    "equivalent characterizations of the global attractor @xmath2 are the followings , namely , @xmath124 and ,    @xmath125",
    "we first recall the definition of ghost solutions first introduced in @xcite .",
    "a ghost solution is a nonstationary solution @xmath126 , such that @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are referred to as the energy and enstrophy , respectively .    using ( [ en_bal ] ) and ( [ ens_bal ] )",
