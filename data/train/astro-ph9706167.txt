    "the earth orbit is immersed in a multicomponent cloud of interplanetary dust and particles of various sizes .",
    "the structure and dynamics of this cloud are very important both for space missions _ _ and interpretations of numerous astronomical data . small dust particle scattering ( the zodiacal light ) and emission contribute substantially to infrared data at @xmath4 m ( hauser 1995 ) .",
    "the dynamics and evolution of interplanetary particles are determined by several basic effects which include : ( i ) the poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag ; ( ii ) resonance effects associated chiefly with jupiter , mars , earth , and venus ; ( iii ) gravitational encounters with these planets , which occur in the form of elastic gravitational scattering of the particles by the planets ; ( iv ) mutual collisions of the particles , and ( v ) evaporation of dust particles .",
    "as we have shown earlier ( gorkavyi , ozernoy , & mather 1996 , 1997 ) , the dust flow evolution governed by those processes can be conveniently described by the continuity equation written in the space of orbital coordinates : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is velocity along the @xmath8-th axis in the phase space . in this equation ,",
    "div_-term @xmath9 describes _ slow _ processes of change of particle orbital elements such as the particle transport due to both the p - r drag and the resonance effects .",
    "the terms @xmath10 and @xmath11 are responsible for _ fast _ processes such as the gravitational scattering of particles by the planets and the contact impacts of particles with each other and with the planets .",
    "let us address the evolution of interplanetary particles governed by only two processes : ( i ) the p - r drag that _ continuously _ changes the particle s orbit ; and ( ii ) the gravitational scattering of particles by the planets , which changes the particle s orbit like a _ jump _ ( for detail , see gorkavyi , ozernoy , & mather 1997 referred to hereinafter as gom ) .",
    "we introduce a small parameter @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the changes , per unit time , due to the appropriate processes in the number density of dust particles at the typical point of the @xmath15-space , @xmath16 being semimajor axis and @xmath17 being eccentricity .",
    "this small parameter makes it possible to derive , by the chapman - enskog approach , a set of equations to get the first two consecutive approximations for particle density of the flow : @xmath18 @xmath19 eq . ( 2 ) gives a first approximation to particle density associated with p - r drag , which is then used to get , with help of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , a correcting term associated with the ( second order ) process of gravitational scattering .",
    "( 3 ) applied to the dynamics of particles governed by gravitational scattering was analyzed in our previous paper ( gom ) . in the present paper , we emphasize eq .",
    "( 2 ) by exploring the poynting - robertson drag as the leading effect for the dynamics of small particles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in ch . 1",
    ", we derive the integrals of motion of dust particles , assuming the pr - drag as the dominating effect . in ch .",
    "2 , we find solutions of the continuity equation for the dust flow from a point source of dust ( such as a comet or an asteroid ) .",
    "we also consider here the spatial distribution ( in the coordinate space ) of dust particles from such a source . in ch . 3 , we generalize those analytical solutions for evaporating dust particles , whose radii decrease with time . ch .",
    "4 deals with dust flows produced by numerous real sources ( 217 comets and 5000 asteroids ) . in ch . 5",
    ", we summarize our results and discuss the underlying assumptions as well as further work .",
    "the rates @xmath20 ( i.e. @xmath21 ) for the pr - drag have been given in a number of papers ( , burns et al . 1979 ; liou , zook & jackson 1995 ) : @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the mass of the sun , and @xmath26 is the ratio of the solar radiation pressure force to the gravitation force : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the solar luminosity , @xmath29 is the gravitational constant , @xmath30 is the speed of light , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the particle s radius and density , accordingly .",
    "the coefficient @xmath33 depends on the optical properties of the particle and the ratio of its size to the wavelength of light ; for a perfect particle @xmath34 for an asteroidal dust particle , we adopt @xmath35 @xmath36 m and @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 ( e.g. , dermott et al . 1994 ) .    along the particle s trajectory",
    ", one gets @xmath39 by integrating this equation , the particle s trajectory in @xmath40-space is easily obtained to be @xmath41 in agreement with wyatt & whipple ( 1950 ) .",
    "this integral of motion implies a continuity of the particle s trajectory in ( @xmath40)-space . the trajectory is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "_ the flow of particles _ along evolutionary trajectories shown in fig.1 is governed by an equation ( derived in the appendix ) that depends only on the variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath42 ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the value of @xmath47 is given here for the case when the particle size does not depend on the orbital parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( for a more general case , see appendix ) .",
    "the characteristics of the partial differential equation ( 9 ) ( the integrals of motion ) are @xmath48 found above [ eq.(8 ) ] and @xmath49 given by @xmath50 the number density @xmath51 of dust particles along the particle trajectory in @xmath40-space is shown as a function of semimajor axis @xmath16 in fig . 2 for various @xmath49 . the physical meaning of the integrals @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the _ conservation of the particle s flux _ along the flow under the p - r effect ( note that the flux of the particles is conserved in conditions when the energy is not ) . @xmath48 and @xmath49 as the integrals of motion for the particle s flow under the p - r drag qualitatively play the same role as the tisserand criterion does in the process of gravitational scattering ( see gom ) .",
    "as is shown in gom , gravitational scattering results in  jumps \" in the particle s coordinates in @xmath40-space . however , those jumps obey the tisserand criterion implying the conservation of the particle s energy in the planet s coordinate system under the gravitational scattering , which is an elastic process . for a particle moving under the p - r drag alone ,",
    "the energy is _ not _ conserved and the tisserand criterion obviously breaks down , but the role of the integrals of motion is taken by @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "meanwhile for the particles which experience , along with the p - r drift , the ( in fact , instantaneous ) gravitational scattering by a planet , the tisserand criterion holds as well .",
    "indeed , during a short time interval of a gravitational scattering , the pr - drag practically does not change the particle s energy .",
    "the integrals @xmath48 ( 8) and @xmath49 ( 10 ) fully describe a stationary flow of dust particles produced by an arbitrary source of dust . as for the dust distribution in the coordinate space",
    ", it can be transformed from that in @xmath15-space with the help of @xmath48 and @xmath49 by using the haug ( 1958 ) double integral .",
    "this numerical procedure is rather complicated but , if we constrain ourselves to _ point sources _ in @xmath15-space ( such as comets and asteroids with known @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , the dust flows from such sources can be analyzed by means of a much more simple analytical technique to be presented in the next section .",
    "for a point source in @xmath15-space , two simple , 1-d continuity equations apply : @xmath52 @xmath53 in orbital coordinates , 1-d distributions of the particle number density along the @xmath16-axis and @xmath17-axis are given , in the stationary state , accordingly by @xmath54 @xmath55 here @xmath56 is a constant to be found from boundary conditions , and @xmath17 in equation for @xmath57 can be eliminated with the help of the integral of motion @xmath48 that describes , for a point source , the trajectory of motion of the entire dust flow .    a transform from the space of orbital elements @xmath15 to @xmath58-space",

    "it is convenient to introduce the surface density @xmath67 where @xmath68 and therefore    @xmath69 with @xmath70 it is worth mentioning that functions ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) diverge at the pericenter and apocenter points .",

    "if the region under consideration , @xmath76 , includes the pericenter or apocenter of the dust particle orbit , the integration should be done as far as the pericenter or apocenter , accordingly .",
    "equation ( 22 ) , as opposed to eqs .",

    ", one can find , by using the solution ( 14 ) for @xmath77 of the continuity equation ( 12 ) , the total dust mass in any region @xmath76 of the plume ( taking into account the comment on the integration limits ) is : @xmath78 the result is given by @xmath79 @xmath80 -\\arcsin{1\\over e}\\bigl [ { r_1(1-e^2)\\over c_1 e^{4/5}}-1 \\bigr ] \\biggr\\}\\,de}.\\eqno(24)\\ ] ] the integration limits are easily found by comparing the location of the apocenter or pericenter of particle orbit relative to the boundaries of the region under consideration , @xmath76 .",
    "thus the problem of a transform from the space of orbital elements to the @xmath58-space is solved by reducing it to a comparatively simple single integration to be done numerically .",
    "the above technique can be applied to both stationary and non - stationary flows .",
    "the source of dust can appear owing to an instantaneous ejection , e.g. be associated with a collision of asteroids ( sykes 1990 ; mann et al .",
    "the resulting drift of dust particles ( assumed to have the same size and located initially as a point source at @xmath81 ) is shown , for three instants of time , in fig .",
    "3 .    let us address a situation when the source of dust has recently appeared and continues to operate .",
    "this happens , for example , when a new comet appears in a given point of @xmath15-space as a result of a ` jump ' due to the strong gravitational scattering of that comet by a planet .",
    "suppose that the first dust particles ejected from such a source have reached the semimajor axis @xmath82 . in order to derive the density distribution in the formed dust cloud ,",
    "it is sufficient to integrate equations(23 ) and ( 24 ) down to @xmath83 , and not through the entire dust plume .",

    ", small eccentricities result in the surface density @xmath84 const , which implies that the _ volume density _ ( i.e. accounting for inclination @xmath8 ) is @xmath85 .",
    "this result reproduces the well - known characteristic density run of the interplanetary dust .",
    "if the source of dust has an eccentric orbit ( such as the encke comet ) , the density run is much steeper .",
    "the boundary between the plateau and cut - off of all three curves on fig .",
    "5 is located at the pericenter of the source of dust , @xmath86 , which is due to the fact that the pericenter of a particle experiencing the p - r drag undergoes the least shift compared to its semimajor axis and apocenter .",
    "here we deal with a situation , important in the dynamics of the interplanetary particles , when one needs to take into account an evaporative effect of the solar wind upon a particle ( see e.g. johnson 1991 ) .",
    "we describe the mass loss of a particle of mass @xmath87 by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the mass of molecules sputtered from the dust particle s surface , @xmath90 is the molecular weight , @xmath91 is the proton mass , @xmath92 is the number of particles of the @xmath8-th kind in the solar wind colliding with the dust particle , and @xmath93 is the sputtering coefficient , i.e. the number of moleculs sputtered from the dust particle by one wind particle .",
    "if the dust particles that drift to the sun owing to the pr - drag have small eccentricities , the particle s size , @xmath94 , changes according to a simple law @xmath95 , where the power law index @xmath96 is given by ( shestakova 1994 ) : @xmath97 here @xmath98 is an average molecular weight of the solar wind , @xmath99 is the ratio of the corpuscular luminosity of the sun to the radiative one @xmath100 , and it is assumed that @xmath101 . if one only accounts for the contribution of protons and @xmath102-particles to the dust particle s mass changes , one finds ( shestakova 1994 ) : @xmath103 which yields @xmath104 for silicates , and @xmath105 for ice ( h@xmath106o ) . bearing in mind that both @xmath26 and @xmath107 , equation ( 9 ) takes the form ( see appendix ) : @xmath108}.\\eqno(28)\\ ] ] from this equation , the first integral given by eq .",

    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) . in order to determine the mass of dust in any region @xmath72",

    "6 demonstrates a ` plume ' formed from a typical asteroid for different @xmath114 .",
    "as the sources of dust , we have incorporated the first 5000 numbered asteroids ( ita 1994 ) , which comprise several distinct families ( zapalla et al . 1995 ) as well as 217 comets with @xmath115 taken from marsden & williams ( 1992 ) .",
    "the positions of these sources on the diagram @xmath116 are presented on figs . 7 ( asteroids ) and 8 ( comets ) .",

    ", we adopt the simplest assumptions : ( i ) all 5000 asteroids produce dust particles with the same rate and ( ii ) comets produce dust particles whenever they pass pericenter so that their contribution into the zodiacal cloud is @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the comet orbital period and typically @xmath124 .",
    "we neglect the comets ( sungrazers ) with @xmath125 , assuming that the dust produced so close to the sun evaporates very soon .    to visualize easily any deviations of @xmath120 from the ` standard ' solution @xmath126 while making comparison with the data on the volume density distribution of interplanetary / zodiacal dust , it is convenient to deal with @xmath127 .",
    "the expected contribution of the above 5000 asteroidal sources to @xmath128 is shown in fig .",
    "9 . it can be seen that the cut - off at @xmath129 au , associated with the asteroidal distribution in @xmath130 , is mainly due to the asteroids belonging to the inner and middle groups .",
    "we have also computed @xmath120 due to the 1000 largest asteroids with a result that differs insignificantly from the entire sample .",
    "therefore , our neglecting the asteroidal distribution in sizes is not critical for our conclusions .",
    "the expected contribution of the above 217 comet sources to @xmath128 is shown in fig . 10 .",
    "it can be seen that the density run does not have kinks at @xmath131 au and is much steeper compared to what is due to the asteroidal sources ( see fig .",
    "let us consider the combined cometary and asteroidal contributions into the interplanetary dust density .",
    "the total value of @xmath132 for a mixture of 25% ( in number density ) cometary and 75% asteroidal components is shown in fig .",
    "the density run has been approximated by @xmath133 .",

    "accounting for evaporation of dust particles changes the results in a more substantial way : if one takes @xmath137=0.025 for asteroidal dust and @xmath138=0.56 for cometary dust ( shestakova 1994 ) then one gets the power law index @xmath139 in the region @xmath140 au when the ratio of the volume densities ( asteroids / comets ) equals 45%/55% .",
    "the asteroidal / cometary mass ratios , which provide the observed @xmath139 for different possible values of @xmath141 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , are given in table 2 .",
    "% % editor : put table 2 here % %    the mass ratios presented in table 2 for spherical layers at various @xmath58 differ from the ratio of volume densities in the ecliptic plane ( the 4th line of table ) because of different inclinations of the cometary and asteroidal sources of dust and , therefore , of different thickness of the dust cloud . the last column of table 2 is fairly consistent with the estimations for asteroidal / cometary ratios obtained from the iras observations while modelling the shape of the zodiacal cloud ( liou , dermott , & xu 1995 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the evaporative power law index @xmath137 influences those results insignificantly : if one puts @xmath137=0.0 , the data in the last column of table 2 would change by no more than 1% .",
    "the continuity equation written in the space of orbital elements , which we have proposed to use as a tool for studying the dynamical evolution of interplanetary particles , is very effective not only for gravitational scattering ( gorkavyi , ozernoy & mather 1996 , gom ) but , as is shown above , for the chief factor of dynamical evolution of the interplanetary dust cloud  the poynting - robertson effect . by solving the continuity equation ,",
    "we have found two integrals of motion governed by the p - r drag and , as a result , have derived _ the density run for a quasi - stationary state of the interplanetary dust cloud . _    based on our approach , we are able to compute the formation of a dust cloud from many cometary , asteroidal , etc .",
    "dust sources , either observed or assumed to exist , by adopting various reasonable assumptions about the rates of dust production . as an outcome , we get the theoretical model for dust distribution both in radius and latitude , in the solar system .",
    "we call ` the reference model ' the model that only accounts for the solar gravitational field and the p - r effect . by accounting for the other dynamical factors",
    ", we can get corrections to the reference model .",
    "computations performed in the framework of the reference model yield radial density runs of the interplanetary dust obtained under various model assumptions and described above .",
    "they enable us to derive some general conclusions as follows :    * the asteroidal component of the interplanetary dust is typically characterized by @xmath85 up to 1.7 au with a sharp cut - off at @xmath142 au [ e.g @xmath143 at @xmath144 au ] .",
    "the predicted cut - off is entirely consistent with what is observed for the zodiacal cloud and the main core - population of the dust in the solar system ( divine 1993 ) ; * the power law index @xmath134 in the distribution of the volume density of the zodiacal dust particles , @xmath1 , depends on several factors : * * at radii smaller than the pericenter of the source of dust , ( @xmath145 ) , the index @xmath146 differs significantly from that , @xmath147 , at radii larger than the pericenter of the source of dust , ( @xmath148 ) ; * * both @xmath149 and @xmath150 depend strongly on eccentricity of the source : as @xmath17 increases from 0 to 1 , @xmath149 increases from @xmath151 to 0 whereas the value of @xmath150 increases from @xmath152 to @xmath153 ; * * accounting for the particle s evaporation , both @xmath149 and @xmath150 tend to increase ( see fig .",
    "6 ) ; * * for a system of dust sources distributed in @xmath16 and/or @xmath17 , the index @xmath134 differs substantially inside and outside the system ( see fig . 12 ) . for such distributed sources",
    ", there is a smooth transition between ( and not a jump from ) @xmath149 and @xmath150 near the pericenter .",
    "* in the region @xmath154 au , observations yield @xmath155 ( divine 1993 ) or @xmath156 ( levasseur - regourd 1996 ) . the observed deviation from the classical law @xmath157",
    "may be related to the contribution of the cometary dust component .",
    "this component ( which alone would result in @xmath158 ) is expected to contribute as much as about 25% in number density ( or about 50% in mass ) to the dust cloud near earth ; * the ratio of the cometary dust contribution to that of the asteroidal dust into @xmath120 has a minimum at @xmath159 1.8 - 2 au and it is large in the inner region of the solar system ( @xmath160 au ) as well as in the outer region of the main asteroid belt ( @xmath161 au ) . * the dust created by the kuiper belt should fill the inner region of the solar system as a more or less homogeneous layer with @xmath162 . at @xmath163",
    "au that dust may dominate over the comet and asteroidal dust components .",
    "let us turn to discussing how the adopted approximations influence our conclusions .",
    "the basic approximations of our reference model are : ( i ) a steady - state character of the model and ( ii ) neglect of other dynamical factors except the p - r drag .    approximation ( i )",
    "could be easily abandoned  we are able to compute the non - stationary processes as well .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "4 shows different stages of dust plume formation of a source that once appeared and continues to produce dust particles .",
    "therefore , this approximation does not imply any restriction in our approach or a failure of our model ; it only results from an incompleteness of our knowledge of whether the real sources of dust are stationary or not .    approximation ( ii ) implies that our solutions fail to describe such phenomena as the resonance circumsolar dust rings near earth ( jackson & zook 1989 ) , which may contain as many as @xmath164% of the particles of the zodiacal cloud ( dermott et al .",
    "1994 ; liou , dermott , & xu 1995 ) . in our further work , we will fully incorporate the resonance and related effects .    some minor approximations in our computations , such as the intensity of comets as dust sources as a function of their distances from the sun , and the law of dust particle evaporation , are also worth refining .",
    "besides , we have ignored in the above computations the distribution of dust sources in size and chemical abundance as well as the effects of observational selection in asteroidal and cometary populations",
    ". however , all uncertainties in the those efffects can be easily explored by varying the parameters of the model for the zodiacal cloud formation .",
    "for instance , while computing a multi - component model of the dust cloud , we need to compute the reference model and get the structure of the dust cloud consisting of the particles of a given size . the value of @xmath26 influences not just the speed of a particle s motion along the orbital trajectories but , when @xmath26 is not too small compared to 1 , one needs to account for the change of orbital coordinates of the dust particles beginning with the instant of their escape from the source ( see , e.g. , jackson & zook 1992 ) .    despite the above approximations ,",
    "our reference model has many principal advantages .",
    "being semi - analytical it is flexible enough to be able to compute the dust cloud formation from a large number of various sources having an arbitrary distribution in size , composition , etc .",
    "it takes a short cpu time ( e.g. , 4 min for 217 comets and 1 hour for 5000 asteroids with a 486/dx4 - 100 ) to compute the typical reference model .",
    "therefore it is feasible to deal with multi - variant dust population sources while fitting the available cometary , asteroidal , and far infrared cobe data",
    ". then one could employ our basic model of the dust cloud to incorporate the other effects such as gravitational scattering of dust particles by planets ( gorkavyi , ozernoy & mather 1997 ) , resonance capture of dust ( jackson & zook 1989 ; dermott et al .",
    "1994 ) , particle multiple collisions , etc .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing that our continuity equation ( 1 ) is well suited to the study of various large scale properties of the interplanetary dust cloud . our approach might be fruitful for solving a number of related problems , including the structure of protoplanetary and circumstellar disks .",
