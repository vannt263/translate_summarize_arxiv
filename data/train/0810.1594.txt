    "the results are consistent with the _ asca _ results , but the abundance and the ionization time scale are better determined thanks to the better energy resolution of xis .",

    "the absorption column of g359.0@xmath00.9 is smaller than sources in the galactic center ( gc ) , thus this snr is likely a foreground source . on the other hand",

    "@xcite reported that hess  j1745@xmath0303 region  a had spatial coincidence with a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the tev emission is also associated with the neutral iron line emission , although we can not unambiguously conclude that due to the poor statistics . the positional coincidence of the neutral iron line and the molecular cloud reminds us of reflected x - rays originating in the past activity in the gc ( e.g. , * ?",
    "if the molecular cloud is optically thin , the line emission intensity , @xmath22 , should be proportional to the mass of the molecular cloud and the viewing angle from the gc , so that @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the mass of the molecular cloud , the angular size of the molecular cloud viewed from the gc , and the angular separation between the cloud and the gc , respectively @xcite .",
    "we compared the masses of the molecular cloud coincident with source  a of hess  j1745@xmath0303 and the most famous x - ray reflection nebula , sgr  b2 @xcite .",

    "this estimated value is compatible with the observed one , @xmath21  ph  s@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this molecular cloud is a new example of x - ray reflection nebula and that the molecular cloud is located in the gc region .",
    "we believe that hard x - ray observations are the strong tools to judge whether the molecular clouds are in the gc region or not .",
    "we derive a 90% x - ray flux upper - limit for the hess  j1745@xmath0303 region  a in the 210  kev band of @xmath1  ergs  s@xmath2@xmath3 , which is tighter than the _ xmm _ results @xcite .",
    "the flux ratio between 210  kev and 110  tev , @xmath7 , is larger than 4 , which could be larger than tev emitting shell - type snrs and pwne @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we discuss specific models of the emission mechanism to reproduce the observed results of x - ray and tev gamma - rays for the region a of hess  j1745@xmath0303 .",
    "in particular , we focus on whether or not the upper limit of nonthermal x - ray emission , which is derived in the present work , gives us significant constraints on the theoretical models .",
    "we consider hadronic and leptonic models separately .",
    "since is near the galactic center , the gev emission may be overlaid with the intense galactic diffuse emission and uncertainty is very large .",
    "hence we neglect it here for simplicity , and take into account only x - ray and tev gamma - ray bands .      in hadronic models , tev gamma - rays originate from accelerated protons .",
    "it is assumed that the proton energy spectrum has a form of @xmath29 with an index , @xmath30 , and cut - off energy , @xmath31 . here",
    ", the value of @xmath30 is highly uncertain , so we adopt @xmath32 as a typical value .",
    "the high - energy protons collide with target protons in the ism or molecular cloud , generating neutral ( @xmath33 ) and charged ( @xmath34 ) pions .",
    "the former decays into gamma rays , while the decay of the latter causes secondary electrons and positrons producing bremsstrahlung , inverse compton , and synchrotron emission .",
    "although it may be likely that the region  a of is associated with a molecular cloud and target matter density @xmath35 is high , the low-@xmath35 case can not be , at present , excluded .",
    "so , we consider two cases , in which @xmath36  @xmath37 and @xmath38  @xmath37 , independently . the value of @xmath35 in the latter case is adopted according to @xcite . generally speaking , in the former , bremsstrahlung emission is not dominant in the tev gamma - ray band , while it may often be dominant in the latter .    at",
    "first we consider the case @xmath36",
    "@xmath37 ( see the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "since the value of @xmath35 is small , emissions from secondary electrons is dim in the gamma - ray band , so that the @xmath33-decay emission dominates .",
    "we find that as long as @xmath39  @xmath37 , the bremsstrahlung emission of secondary electrons and positrons is not dominant in the gamma - ray band .",
    "we fix @xmath40  tev in order to fit the observed spectral shape in the tev energy range .",
    "then , as can be seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , derived upper limit on nonthermal x - rays are explained if the magnetic field @xmath41  mg .",
    "this is rather loose limit on the magnetic field . because of the small value of @xmath31 , the maximum energy of secondary electrons and positrons is small , @xmath42  tev , so that the large value of @xmath43 is necessary for bright synchrotron x - rays emitted by them",
    "this comes from the fact that the characteristic frequency of electron / positron synchrotron radiation is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the energy of secondary electrons or positrons . for assumed distance of 8.5  kpc ,",
    "the total energy of accelerated protons is estimated as @xmath46  erg .",
    "next we consider the case @xmath38",
    "@xmath37 ( see the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "if the magnetic field strength is small ( @xmath47 g ) , the bremsstrahlung emission from secondary electrons and positrons is comparable to the @xmath33-decay gamma - ray emission .",
    "however , in the strong field cases , the synchrotron cooling effect significantly suppresses the number of @xmath48 , resulting small contribution to the gamma - rays . on the other hand ,",
    "the synchrotron radiation of secondary @xmath48 is brighter for larger @xmath43 .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath36  @xmath37 , the magnetic field is no larger than @xmath49  mg .",
    "@xcite derived the relatively high magnetic field value , 0.20.6  mg , which is measured from the zeeman splitting of maser lines . the molecular cloud associated with the region",
    "a might have the similar magnetic field strength , and then , @xmath50 mg field and the number density of the cloud @xmath51",
    "@xmath37 is roughly consistent with the previous result on other molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "as long as the field strength in the cloud is @xmath52  mg or less , the expected flux of secondary synchrotron radiation in the x - ray band is rather small and below the observed upper limit . for assumed distance of 8.5  kpc ,",
    "the total energy of accelerated protons is estimated as @xmath53  erg .",
    "then , the mean energy density of high - energy protons at region  a of is calculated as @xmath54  ev  @xmath37 if we assume the volume of the molecular cloud of @xmath55  @xmath56 @xcite ,      in the leptonic model , tev gamma - rays arise via bremsstrahlung and inverse compton process ( with cmb seed photons ) emissions of primarily accelerated electrons , and x - rays arise from their synchrotron radiation .",
    "again we assume that the electron energy spectrum has a form of @xmath57 with an fixed index , @xmath58 , and the cut - off energy , @xmath59 . as well as the hadronic model , both low- and high-@xmath35 cases",

    "then , the relatively weak magnetic field , @xmath62  @xmath63 g , is necessary in order for the flux of synchrotron x - rays to be smaller than the observed upper limit .",
    "we find that for an assumed distance of 8.5  kpc , the total energy of accelerated electrons is estimated as @xmath64  erg , which is very large compared with the typical young snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath37 ( see the right panel of fig .  [",

    "the total energy of accelerated electrons is estimated as @xmath67  erg and @xmath68  erg for @xmath69  @xmath63 g and @xmath70  @xmath63 g , respectively . if we assume the volume of the molecular cloud of @xmath55  @xmath56 @xcite , the mean energy density of high - energy protons at region  a of is calculated as @xmath71  ev  @xmath37 and @xmath72  ev  @xmath37 for @xmath69  @xmath63 g and @xmath70  @xmath63 g , respectively .    in the case of @xmath38  @xmath37 ,",
    "the energy - loss time scale , @xmath73 , for tev - emitting electrons via synchrotron and bremsstrahlung radiation is less than @xmath74  yr .",
    "then , the diffusion length scale is estimated as @xmath75  pc , where we assume the bohm type diffusion , @xmath76 .",
    "even if @xmath77 , this length scale is much smaller than the source size of region  a of ( @xmath78  pc assuming the distance of 8.5  kpc ) , which implies that the high - energy electrons coming from a nearby accelerator can not penetrate into deep interior of a molecular cloud . on the other hand , when @xmath60  @xmath37 , relatively large energy of accelerated electrons is required .",
    "so , the leptonic models considered above may be unlikely .",
    "however , in order to derive the firm conclusion , we need to discuss further detail with more information on , such as the intrinsic source size , the number density of target matter , more precise spectrum in all wavelength ( from radio to gev  tev gamma - rays ) , and so on",

    "<S> _ suzaku _ observations of a tev unidentified ( unid ) source , hess  j1745@xmath0303 , are presented . a possible excess of neutral iron line emission is discovered , and is likely associated with the main part of hess  j1745@xmath0303 , named `` region  a '' . it may be an x - ray reflection nebula where the x - rays from previous galactic center ( gc ) activity are reflected by a molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this result further strengthens the assumption that the molecular cloud which is spatially coincident with region a of hess  j1745@xmath0303 is located in the gc region . </S>",
    "<S> the tev emission from molecular clouds is reminiscent of the diffuse tev gamma - rays from the gc giant molecular clouds , and it could have the same emission mechanism . with deep exposure mapping observations by _ suzaku _ , a tight upper - limit on the 210  kev continuum diffuse emission from region a is obtained , as @xmath1  ergs  s@xmath2@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the flux ratio between 110  tev and 210  kev is larger than 4 . </S>",
    "<S> possible scenarios to reproduce wide - band spectra from kev to tev are examined . </S>",
    "<S> thermal x - rays from nearby two old supernova remnants , g359.0@xmath00.9 and g359.1@xmath00.5 , are detected , and their emission properties are well determined in the present study with deep exposure . </S>"
