    "the study of discrete one - dimensional chains of particles with the nearest - neighbor interactions provides insight to the dynamics of various physical and biological systems , such as crystals , wave systems , and biopolymers  @xcite . in the thermal equilibrium state",
    ", such nonlinear chains can be described by the canonical gibbs measure  @xcite with the hamiltonian h=_j + + v(q_j - q_j+1),[intro_hpq ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the momentum and the displacement from the equilibrium position of the @xmath3-th particle , respectively , @xmath4 is the anharmonic part of the potential , and the mass of each particle and the linear spring constant are scaled to unity . in this article , we only consider the potentials of the _ restoring _ type , i.e. , the potentials for which the gibbs measure exists . in order to study interactions of waves in such systems ,",
    "one usually introduces the canonical complex normal variables @xmath5 via a_k=,[intro_a ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the fourier transforms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , and @xmath8 is the linear dispersion relation of the waves represented by @xmath5 . in terms of the @xmath5 ,",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ intro_hpq ] ) becomes h=_k|a_k|^2+v(a)[ham_a ] , where @xmath9 is the combination of various products of @xmath5 and @xmath10 corresponding to various wave - wave interactions . if the potential in eq .",
    "( [ intro_hpq ] ) is harmonic , i.e. , @xmath11 , then @xmath5 correspond to ideal , _ free _ waves , which have no energy exchanges among different @xmath12 modes . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the boltzmann distribution @xmath13 with temperature @xmath14 , gives rise to the following properties of free waves a_k^*a_l&=&n_k^k_l,[intro_asa ] + a_ka_l&=&0[intro_aa ] , for any @xmath12 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the power spectrum .",
    "if the anharmonic part of the potential is sufficiently weak , then corresponding waves @xmath5 remain almost free , and eqs .",
    "( [ intro_asa ] ) and  ( [ intro_aa ] ) would be approximately satisfied in the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "however , when the nonlinearity becomes stronger , waves @xmath5 become strongly correlated , and , in general , the correlations between waves [ eq .  ( [ intro_aa ] ) ] no longer vanish . in particular ,",
    "@xmath17 , as will be shown below .",
    "naturally , the question arises : can the strongly nonlinear system in thermal equilibrium still be viewed as a system of almost free waves in some statistical sense ? in this article",
    ", we address this question with an affirmative answer : it turns out that the system  ( [ intro_hpq ] ) can be described by a complete set of _ renormalized _ canonical variables @xmath18 , which still possess the wave properties given by eqs .",
    "( [ intro_asa ] ) and  ( [ intro_aa ] ) with a renormalized linear dispersion .",
    "the waves that correspond to these new variables @xmath18 will be referred to as _ renormalized _ waves .",
    "since these renormalized waves possess the equilibrium rayleigh - jeans distribution  @xcite and vanishing correlations between waves , they resemble free , non - interacting waves , and can be viewed as statistical normal modes .",
    "furthermore , it will be demonstrated that the renormalized linear dispersion for these renormalized waves has the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the linear frequency renormalization factor , and is _ independent _ of @xmath12 as a consequence of the gibbs measure .    in our method , the construction of the renormalized variables @xmath18 does not depend on a particular form or strength of the anharmonic potential , as long as it is of the restoring type with only the nearest neighbor interactions , as in eq .",
    "( [ intro_hpq ] ) .",
    "therefore , our approach is non - perturbative and can be applied to a large class of systems with strong nonlinearity . however , in this article , we will focus on the @xmath0-fpu chain to illustrate the theoretical framework of the renormalized waves . we will verify that @xmath18 effectively constitute normal modes for the @xmath0-fpu chain in thermal equilibrium by showing that ( i ) the theoretically obtained renormalized linear dispersion relationship is in excellent agreement with its dynamical manifestation in our numerical simulation , and ( ii ) the equilibrium distribution of @xmath18 is still a rayleigh - jeans distribution and @xmath18 s are uncorrelated . note that similar expressions for the renormalization factor @xmath21 have been previously discussed in the framework of an approximate virial theorem  @xcite or effective long wave dynamics via the zwanzig - mori projection  @xcite . however , in our theory , the exact formula for the renormalization factor is derived from a _ precise _ mathematical construction of statistical normal modes , and is valid for all wave modes @xmath12  no longer restricted to long waves .",
    "next , we address how renormalization arises from the dynamical wave interaction in the @xmath0-fpu chain",
    ". we will show that the @xmath0-fpu chain can be _ effectively _ described as a four - wave interacting hamiltonian system of the renormalized resonant waves @xmath18 .",
    "we will study the resonance structure of the @xmath0-fpu chain and find that most of the exact resonant interactions are _ trivial _ , i.e. , the interactions with no momentum exchange among different wave modes . in",
    "what follows , the renormalization of the linear dispersion will be explained as a collective effect of these trivial resonant interactions of the renormalized waves @xmath18 .",
    "we will use a self - consistency argument to find an approximation , @xmath22 , of the renormalization factor @xmath21 .",
    "as will be seen below , the self - consistency argument essentially is of a mean - field type , i.e. , the renormalization arises from the scattering of a wave by a mean - background of waves in thermal equilibrium via trivial resonant interactions . we note that our self - consistency , mean - field argument is not limited to the weak nonlinearity .",
    "very good agreement of the renormalization factor @xmath21 and its dynamical approximation @xmath22  for weakly as well as strongly nonlinear waves  confirms that the renormalization is , indeed , _ a direct consequence _ of the trivial resonances .",
    "we will further study the properties of these renormalized waves by investigating how long these waves are coherent , i.e. , what their frequency widths are .",
    "therefore , we consider _ near - resonant _ interactions of the renormalized waves @xmath18 , i.e. , interactions that occur in the vicinity of the resonance manifold , since most of the exact resonant interactions are trivial , i.e. , with no momentum exchanges , and they , can not effectively redistribute energy among the wave modes .    we will demonstrate that near - resonant interactions of the renormalized waves @xmath18 provide a mechanism for effective energy exchanges among different wave modes .",
    "taking into account the near - resonant interactions , we will study analytically the frequency peak broadening of the renormalized waves @xmath18 by employing a multiple time - scale , statistical averaging method . here",
    ", we will arrive at a theoretical prediction of the spatiotemporal spectrum @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the fourier transform of the normal variable @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the frequency .",
    "the predicted width of frequency peaks is found to be in good agreement with its numerically measured values .",
    "in addition , for a finite @xmath0-fpu chain , we will mention the consequence , to the correlation times of waves , of the momentum exchanges that cross over the first brillouin zone .",
    "this process is known as the umklapp scattering in the setting of phonon scattering  @xcite .",
    "note that , in the previous studies  @xcite of the fpu chain from the wave turbulence point of view , the effects arising from the finite nature of the chain were not taken into account , i.e. , only the limiting case of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the system size , was considered .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sect_hformalism ]",
    ", we discuss a chain of particles with the nearest - neighbor nonlinear interactions .",

    "we show how to construct the corresponding renormalized variables with the renormalized linear dispersion . in section  [ sect_fpu ] , we rewrite the @xmath0-fpu chain as an interacting four - wave hamiltonian system .",
    "we study the dynamics of the chain numerically and find excellent agreement between the renormalized dispersion , obtained analytically and numerically . in section  [ sect_dispersion ] , we describe the resonance manifold analytically and illustrate its controlling role in long - time averaged dynamics using numerical simulation . in section  [ sect_renormalization ] , we derive an approximation for the renormalization factor for the linear dispersion using a self - consistency condition . in section  [ sect_width ] , we study the broadening effect of frequency peaks and predict analytically the form of the spatiotemporal spectrum for the @xmath0-fpu chain .",

    "if only the nearest - neighbor interactions are present , then the chain can be described by the hamiltonian h = h_2+v,[ham_pq ] where the quadratic part of the hamiltonian takes the form h_2=_j=1^np_j^2+(q_j - q_j+1)^2,[h2 ] and the anharmonic potential @xmath29 is the function of the relative displacement @xmath30 . here",
    "periodic boundary conditions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are imposed .",

    "we consider the systems with the anharmonic potential of the restoring type , i.e. , the potential for which the integral in eq .",
    "( [ zpq ] ) converges .",
    "it can be easily shown that for system  ( [ ham_pq ] ) the average kinetic energy @xmath36 of each mode is independent of the wave number k_k = k_l,[kkind ] where @xmath12 and @xmath15 are wave numbers , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 denotes averaging over the gibbs measure .",
    "similarly , the average quadratic potential @xmath39 of each mode is independent of the wave number u_k = u_l,[qkind ] where @xmath40 .    if the nonlinear interactions are weak , then it is convenient to further transform the hamiltonian  ( [ ham_pq ] ) to the complex normal variables defined by eq .",

    "i.e. , @xmath41 , we obtain a standard virial theorem in the form k_k_v=0=u_k_v=0.[free ] as a consequence of this virial theorem , we have the properties of free waves , which were already mentioned above [ eqs .",
