    "a _ minimal surface ( submanifold or hypersurface ) _ in a manifold @xmath3 is a surface ( submanifold or hypersurface ) whose mean curvature vanishes everywhere .",

    "hence , by using compactness theorem for integral currents ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , he gets a convergent subsequence for @xmath43 _ for each _ @xmath33-ball . then , by using diagonal subsequence argument , he extracts a convergent subsequence @xmath44 where @xmath13 is an area minimizing integral p+1-current with @xmath45 .",
    "this result is one of the most important results in the field .",
    "this seminal paper can be considered as the beginning of the study of the asymptotic plateau problem .",
    "later , we will see various generalizations of this result to different settings .",
    "note that the embeddedness assumption on the given asymptotic boundary is very essential . in @xcite , lang constructed immersed examples in @xmath8 with no solutions to asymptotic plateau problem .",
    "( interior regularity ) by interior regularity results of geometric measure theory @xcite , @xcite , when @xmath46 , the currents in theorem are smoothly embedded hypersurfaces except for a singular set of hausdorff dimension @xmath47 .",
    "in particular when @xmath48 , @xmath13 is a smoothly embedded hypersurface in @xmath10 . in the higher codimension case ( @xmath49 ) , the interior regularity results say that the absolutely area minimizing currents are smoothly embedded p+1-submanifolds in @xmath10 except for a singular set of hausdorff dimension @xmath50 .",
    "later , again by using geometric measure theory methods , lang and bangert generalized this result to gromov hyperbolic hadamard manifolds with bounded geometry , and some other special cases in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite let @xmath3 be a gromov hyperbolic hadamard @xmath51-manifold with bounded geometry .",
    "let @xmath52 be a @xmath38 dimensional closed submanifold in @xmath30 .",
    "then there exists a complete , absolutely area minimizing locally integral p+1-current @xmath13 in @xmath3 asymptotic to @xmath32 at infinity .",
    "note that the varieties constructed in theorems above are absolutely area minimizing , and has no topological restrictions on them .",
    "another interesting case is the fixed topological type .       + in above result , anderson got absolutely area minimizing varieties asymptotic to given submanifold in the asymptotic sphere .",
    "as there is no topological restriction on the objects , we have no idea about the topological properties of them .    another interesting case in plateau problem",
    "is the fixed topological type .",
    "the question is to find the smallest area surface in the given topological type with the given boundary .",
    "its generalization to the asymptotic plateau problem is natural .    on the other hand ,",
    "hyperbolic @xmath53-manifolds , and essential @xmath29-dimensional submanifolds in them are very active research area . by essential , we mean @xmath54-injective surfaces , and they are very important tools to understand the structure of the hyperbolic manifold by using geometric topology tools . at this point ,",
    "when we pass to the universal cover of the hyperbolic manifold and essential surfaces in them , the asymptotic plateau problem in disk type becomes an important technique for construction of area minimizing representative of these essential surfaces in @xmath53-manifolds .    in @xcite ,",
    "anderson focused on the asymptotic plateau problem in disk type , and gave an existence result in dimension @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite let @xmath52 be a simple closed curve in @xmath55 .",
    "then , there exists a complete , area minimizing plane @xmath13 in @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "the proof is very similar to the proof of the previous theorem .",
    "the basic difference is instead of using area minimizing surfaces @xmath58 with @xmath39 , he used the area minimizing _ embedded _",
    "disks @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the existence of the disks comes from the solution of plateau problem in disk type . however , the essential point is that the disks are embedded and they are given by @xcite ( later more general result given by @xcite ) .",
    "hence , by using similar ideas , anderson extracted a limit @xmath61 where @xmath13 is an area minimizing plane in @xmath10 with @xmath16 .",

    ". it might be possible to construct area minimizing hyperplanes in @xmath10 for any dimension , by generalizing these ideas and white s results in @xcite to replace the sequence of disks @xmath62 in anderson s proof with compact area minimizing hyperplanes in @xmath10 .",
    "also , in @xcite , anderson constructed special jordan curves in @xmath55 such that the absolutely area minimizing surface given by theorem 3.1 can not be a plane ( @xcite , theorem 4.5 ) .",
    "indeed , he constructed examples with genus @xmath63 for any given genus @xmath64 .",
    "he also used these surfaces for some nonuniqueness results which we mention later .    in the same context ,",
    "de oliveira and soret showed the existence of a complete stable minimal surface in @xmath56 for any given topological type of a surface with boundary .",
    "also , they studied the isotopy type of these surfaces in some special cases .",
    "the main difference with anderson s existence result is that anderson starts with the asymptotic boundary data , and gives an area minimizing hypersurface where there is no control on the topological type , while de oliveira and soret starts with a surface with boundary and constructs a stable minimal embedded surface of this type whose asymptotic boundary is essentially determined by the surface .",
    "@xcite let @xmath65 be a compact orientable surface with boundary .",
    "then @xmath66 can be minimally , completely , properly and stably embedded in @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , the embeddings extends smoothly to an embedding from @xmath65 to @xmath67 , the compactification of @xmath56 .    on the other hand",
    ", gabai gave another construction for theorem 3.3 .",
    "indeed , he needed this results for more general metrics , and he gave a topological construction for such area minimizing planes in more general settings .",
    "@xcite let @xmath3 be @xmath56 with a different riemannian metric induced from a metric on a closed @xmath53-manifold .",

    ", gabai starts with a sequence of area minimizing disks @xmath62 in @xmath3 with @xmath73 . to get a limiting plane here , instead of using the compactness theorem of geometric measure theory , he extracts some kind of gromov - hausdorff limit @xmath70 of the sequence @xmath62 by using minimal surface tools and techniques of @xcite .",
    "in particular , the sequence @xmath74 of embedded disks in a riemannian manifold @xmath3 _ converges _ to the lamination @xmath70 if    \\i ) for any convergent sequence @xmath75 in @xmath3 with @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a strictly increasing sequence , @xmath78 .",

    "we call such a lamination @xmath70 a _ @xmath69-limit lamination_. here , the _ topological _ limit @xmath70 is essentially all the limit points of a very special subsequence .",
    "then , since locally these are limits of area minimizing disks , by using the techniques of @xcite he shows first that the leaves of the lamination @xmath70 are minimal planes . then by using topological arguments , gabai proves that these planes are not only minimal , but also area minimizing .",
    "then , he shows that this lamination must stay in a neighborhood of the convex hull of @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the convex hull of @xmath52 and @xmath93 is a constant independent of @xmath52 .",
    "then , he shows that @xmath94 and finishes the proof .    until this paper ,",
    "all the existence results on this problem came out via the techniques of geometric measure theory .",
    "the disadvantage of geometric measure theory is that it is very powerful with absolutely area minimizing submanifolds , but you have to work very hard to get results in fixed topological type case . on the other hand , gabai s techniques are very natural for the fixed topological type case as you can control the limiting process and limiting object topologically .",

    "after the above existence theorems , the next natural question was the regularity of the hypersurfaces @xmath13 obtained as a solution of the asymptotic plateau problem . by the interior regularity theorems of geometric measure theory , @xmath13 is real analytic hypersurface of @xmath10 away from a singular subset of hausdorff dimension @xmath47 .",

    "in particular , if there was a sequence of singular points escaping to infinity ( or converging to a point in asymptotic boundary ) , by rescaling @xmath13 with hyperbolic isometries , they get new area minimizing hypersurfaces , and the images of the singular points in these new area minimizing hypersurfaces would contradict the earlier interior regularity result .",
    "later , by studying the following quasilinear , non - uniformly elliptic equation whose solutions are minimal hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space , lin and tonegawa got higher regularity near asymptotic boundary . in the upper half space model of @xmath10 , let @xmath105 be a domain and @xmath106 be a function . consider @xmath107 which defines a hypersurface in @xmath10 . the volume of @xmath108 where @xmath18 is a compact subset of @xmath109 can be described as follows :    @xmath110    then , the corresponding euler - lagrange equation of this variational integral would give the following dirichlet problem :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 .",

    "if one wants to focus on the boundary regularity of the solution of this dirichlet problem , an equivalent local description of the problem can be given by considering @xmath115 near a point of the asymptotic boundary as a graph over a vertical plane which is tangent to the asymptotic boundary at the given point .",

    "hence , in addition to smooth examples in @xcite , @xcite gives completely nonrectifiable simple closed curve examples where cmc hypersurfaces with the given asymptotic data foliate the hyperbolic space .",
    "also in @xcite , wang constructs a simple closed curve @xmath52 in @xmath55 ( as limit set of a quasi - fuchsian 3-manifold ) which is similar to the one in @xcite , where there can not be a foliation of @xmath56 by cmc surfaces with asymptotic boundary @xmath52 .",
    "other than existence , regularity and number of solutions to the asymptotic plateau problem , there have been other important features which are studied .       + the properly embeddedness of the solution of the asymptotic plateau problem is one of the interesting problems which is under investigation .",
    "namely , the question is whether a solution to the asymptotic plateau problem @xmath13 with @xmath16 where @xmath52 is a codimension-1 closed submanifold in @xmath8 is properly embedded , or not ?",
    "in other words , if @xmath299 is an embedding with @xmath300 , then is @xmath126 proper ?",
    "i.e. whether the preimage of a compact subset @xmath18 of @xmath10 , @xmath301 , is compact in @xmath4 for any @xmath18 .",
    "anderson implicitly talks about this property in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "gabai conjectures the existence of a properly embedded area minimizing plane in @xmath56 ( and for any cocompact metric on @xmath56 ) for any given simple closed curve @xmath52 in @xmath55 .",
    "later , soma proved the existence of such an area minimizing plane in more general situation ( gromov hyperbolic spaces ) in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "later , the author gave an alternative proof for soma s results in @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite let @xmath3 be a gromov hyperbolic @xmath53-space with cocompact metric , and @xmath55 be the sphere at infinity of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath52 be a given simple closed curve in @xmath55 .",
    "then , there exists a properly embedded area minimizing plane @xmath13 in @xmath3 with @xmath16 .    in recent years",
    ", the properly embeddedness of the complete minimal surfaces has also been in serious attack in @xmath213 case .",
    "this is called as calabi - yau conjecture for minimal surfaces , and has been shown by colding and minicozzi in @xcite .",
    "later , the author showed an analogous result for hyperbolic space .",
    "in particular , he showed that for any area minimizing plane @xmath13 in @xmath56 with asymptotic boundary @xmath52 which is a simple closed curve with one smooth point , then @xmath13 is properly embedded in @xmath56 .",
    "the technique is very different from colding and minicozzi s techniques . while colding - minicozzi relates intrinsic distances and extrinsic distances for embedded minimal surface in @xmath213 by using very powerful analytical techniques , the author s techniques are purely topological .",
    "@xcite let @xmath13 be a complete embedded area minimizing plane in @xmath56 with @xmath57 where @xmath52 is a simple closed curve in @xmath55 with at least one smooth ( @xmath100 ) point .",
    "then , @xmath13 must be proper .",
    "( sketch ) assume that @xmath13 is a non - properly embedded area minimizing plane in @xmath56 with @xmath57 where @xmath52 is a simple closed curve in @xmath55 with at least one smooth point .",
    "the author gets a contradiction by analyzing the disks in the intersection of @xmath13 with the balls @xmath302 which exhaust @xmath56 .",
    "first , he shows that for sufficiently large generic @xmath303 , @xmath304 contains infinitely many disjoint disks .",
    "then , he categorize these disks as separating and nonseparating depending on their boundary in the annulus @xmath305 is essential or not .",
    "then , he establishes the key lemma which shows that the nonseparating disks in @xmath302 must stay close to the boundary @xmath306 .",
    "in particular , he proves that if @xmath307 is a nonseparating disk in @xmath308 , then there is a function @xmath309 which is a monotone increasing function with @xmath310 as @xmath311 , such that @xmath312 where @xmath313 is the distance .",
    "he proves the key lemma by using a barrier argument ( see figure 3 ) . in other words , by using the smooth point assumption , he proves the existence of a least area annulus @xmath314 in @xmath56 with @xmath315 , where @xmath316 are simple closed curves sufficiently close to @xmath52 in opposite sides .",
    "since they are area minimizing , any nonseparating disk @xmath307 must stay in one side of the least area annulus @xmath314 . as @xmath317",
    "the distance from @xmath6 to @xmath314 will give the desired function .",
    "hence , this shows that nonseparating disks do not come close to @xmath6 point , and stay close to the boundary @xmath318 .",
    "finally , the author proves the main result by using the key lemma as follows .",
    "a separating disk @xmath319 in @xmath320 will be a subdisk in a nonseparating disk @xmath321 in @xmath322 where @xmath323 . by choosing @xmath324 appropriately and by using the fact that the separating disk @xmath319 is a subset of the disk @xmath321",
    ", he shows that the nonseparating disk @xmath321 comes very close to @xmath6 point , which is a contradiction .",
    "we should add that it would be very interesting to generalize colding - minicozzi s result on calabi - yau conjecture for minimal surfaces to this context @xcite , i.e. relating the intrinsic distances with the extrinsic distance for any embedded minimal surface in @xmath56 .",
    "note that properly embeddedness of absolutely area minimizing hypersurfaces in @xmath10 is almost automatic .",
    "this is because a nonproperly embedded area minimizing hypersurface in @xmath10 would have an intersection of infinite volume with a sufficiently large compact ball in @xmath10 , which is impossible for absolutely area minimizing hypersurfaces .",
    "also , in a forthcoming paper @xcite , the author constructs examples of non - properly embedded minimal planes in @xmath56 .",
    "+ on the other hand , the space of all solutions to the asymptotic plateau problem is another interesting problem , and its structure gives powerful global analysis tools to get important results on the number of solutions to the asymptotic plateau problem .",
    "in particular , the author showed that the space of minimal planes in @xmath56 with asymptotic boundary @xmath198 smooth simple closed curve is a manifold and its projection to the asymptotic boundary is a fredholm map in @xcite . by using these results ,",
    "the author showed a generic uniqueness result ( theorem 5.4 ) for @xmath187 smooth simple closed curves in @xmath55 , @xcite .    very recently , by using different techniques , alexakis and mazzeo generalized author s results to complete properly embedded minimal surfaces of any fixed genus in convex cocompact hyperbolic @xmath53-manifolds ( @xmath56 is a special case ) .",
    "@xcite let @xmath3 be a convex cocompact hyperbolic @xmath53-manifold , and @xmath325 is the space of properly embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath3 of genus @xmath138 with asymptotic boundary @xmath198 simple closed curve in @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath199 be the space of all @xmath198 curves in @xmath30 .",

    "another interesting property of the solutions to the asymptotic plateau problem is that their intersections mostly controlled by their asymptotic boundary . in many cases ,",
    "if the asymptotic boundaries are disjoint , then the solutions to the asymptotic plateau problem are also disjoint .",

    "to generalize the idea of previous theorem , first by using the regularity result of hardt - lin in @xcite ( theorem 4.1 ) , it can be showed that @xmath163 and @xmath164 are separating . as asymptotic boundaries @xmath161 and @xmath162 are disjoint",
