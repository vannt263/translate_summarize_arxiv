    "our detailed knowledge of stars in the main sequence comes from analyses of eclipsing double - lined spectroscopic binaries .",
    "solutions to light and velocity curves of such objects can define masses and radii of the component stars well enough to challenge the details of calculated internal structure and evolution .",
    "in contrast , defining the basic properties of evolved stars is normally much more difficult .",
    "the long periods and correspondingly large separations of binaries containing them make eclipses unlikely , and the existing binaries tend to be only single - lined .",
    "the @xmath0  aur binaries , however , with their eclipses and composite spectra , give us a unique opportunity to determine physical properties of a few massive supergiant stars reliably in the same way we can for many main - sequence stars .",
    "a good example of this is the way bennett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) defined the properties of @xmath0  aur .",
    "wright ( 1970 ) discussed these systems , particularly the three classical systems @xmath0  aur , 31  cyg , and 32  cyg , all three of which have supergiant k primaries paired with b stars close to the main sequence .",
    "table 1 gives their fundamental properties .",
    "most close binaries have circular orbits , although all possible eccentricities seem equally likely among newborn systems , at least those with longer periods ( e.g. , abt 2006 ) .",
    "the three classical @xmath0  aur systems all have sizable eccentricities . for this reason , they ought to be subject to certain binary proximity effects in ways other stars are not . for instance , they will be subject to a non - radial pulsation driven by the variable tidal distortion inevitable in an eccentric binary ( cowling 1941 ; eaton 2008 ; sepinsky et al .  2007 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is equivalent to the ellipsoidal variation from the equilibrium tidal distortion in circular , synchronously rotating binaries . because of the different orientations of their orbits , the two closer systems @xmath0  aur and 32  cyg would manifest different phase dependence of this effect in ways giving clues about the internal properties of supergiants .",
    "guinan & mccook ( 1979 ) claimed to have detected this phenomenon in 32  cyg .",
    "wilson ( 1979 ) included a theory for it in the wilson ",
    "devinney code for calculating binary light curves .",
    "the other major proximity effect , the so - called reflection effect , might be detectable in these systems as well .",
    "all the cool giants and supergiants seem to be variable , probably through radial pulsations .",
    "henry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argued that all stars to the red of the linsky ",
    "haisch coronal dividing line are pulsational variables .",
    "even the red giants to the blue of it are variable given precise radial velocities ( walker et al .",
    "the components of @xmath0  aur binaries would be expected to manifest the pulsations of similar supergiants .",
    "such pulsations would be in addition to the aforementioned proximity effects .",
    "differences in their pulsational periods _ might _ give us an idea of how mass is distributed in their interiors .",
    "zeta aur itself is the most interesting of the three classical systems in terms of its binary interactions .",
    "it has the shortest period ( 970 d ) and biggest eccentricity ( @xmath3 @xmath2 0.4 ) , and these qualities make it most interesting for looking for the effects of a tidally driven non - radial pulsation .",
    "griffin ( 2005 ) discussed the orbit recently , using all the many radial velocities then available .",
    "why , then , should we waste our time redoing his analysis ?",
    "our data are several times as precise , cover one orbit continuously , and thereby begin to show coherent deviations of the k star from its orbital velocity .",
    "we will ( 1 ) improve the orbital elements for two of the three classical @xmath0  aur binaries , ( 2 ) assess the rotation of these stars , ( 3 ) model the ellipsoidal light variations in order to interpret the driven pulsations of the cooler components of these systems , ( 4 ) look for the intrinsic ( radial ) pulsations of these stars and use them to restrict the radii , and ( 5 ) look for evidence of proximity effects and other variation in h@xmath1 .",
    "observations consist of new spectra and photometry for the three classical systems , spanning roughly 3.5 years since 2004 .",
    "all these data come from the completely automatic observatory tennessee state university ( tsu ) maintains at fairborn observatory , a private site in southern arizona ( eaton , boyd , & henry 1996 ) .",
    "we observed @xmath0  aur , 31  cyg , and 32  cyg between jd2,452,860 and jd2,454,200 , obtaining echelle spectra of roughly 30,000 resolution , with the tsu 2-m automatic spectroscopic telescope ( eaton & williamson 2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "this set consists of 302 , 217 , and 348 useful spectra , respectively , for the three stars .",
    "we reduced and analyzed them with standard pipeline techniques to derive radial velocities and equivalent widths of h@xmath1 .",
    "these measurements are available electronically as table 2 . listed are ( 1 ) hjd , the heliocentric julian date of observation ( minus 2,400,000 ) , ( 2 ) @xmath4 , the radial velocity of the k star , ( 3 ) ew1 , an equivalent width of h@xmath1 absorption , and ( 4 ) ew2 , an equivalent width of enhanced absorption in the blue wing of h@xmath1 .",
    "the other column is a tag identifying the star by its hd number .",
    "missing data in this table are identified with a  9.999 \" .",
    "the measured velocities from the ast have a formal external error of 0.100.11 km  s@xmath5   and are 0.35@xmath60.09 km  s@xmath5  more negative than the iau radial - velocity system ( eaton & williamson 2007 ) . the velocities in table 2 are the raw velocities without the + 0.35 km  s@xmath5  correction to the iau system .",
    "values of systemic velocities , @xmath7 , from our orbital solutions , listed in table 4 , are transformed to the iau system .",
    "our h@xmath1 data consist of observed equivalent widths in a wide band ( 6561.36565.05     in the rest frame of the star ) , ew1 , designed to measure the total absorption in the normal profile of such a star , and a narrow band ( 6559.76561.3   ) , ew2 , to detect enhancements of the blue wing of the profile that may signal episodic mass ejections in a star s wind . in measuring the spectra , we adjusted the continuum to a common level by defining 13 pseudocontinuum points in the range 65226600   , automatically measured their levels in the spectra , and renormalizing the spectra to line segments between those points .",
    "the ew s depend on the two points at 6559.3 and 6568.1   .",
    "several hundred spectra of the k giants @xmath1  tau , @xmath1  boo , and @xmath1  ari , which ought to be @xmath2 constant in h@xmath1 , give standard deviations per measurement of 0.046 and 0.020  , respectively , for ew1 and ew2 .",
    "we shall use these values as the uncertainties of measurement .",
    "we also collected @xmath8 observations of the three stars with the tsu 0.4-m automatic photometric telescope ( apt ) , obtaining measurements over complete cycles of both @xmath0  aur and 32  cyg and 4.0 years for 31  cyg .",
    "these measurements consist of nightly means of differential measurements with respect to a comparison star , hd  34412 for @xmath0  aur and hd  192985 for both 31 and 32  cyg .",
    "the check star for @xmath0  aur was hd  30834 , with 32  cyg observed as a check star for 31  cyg .",
    "these data should have an external error near 0.004 mag ( henry 1995 ) .",

    "we identify missing data , such as the nonexistent @xmath10@xmath11 s , with a  99.999 \" .",
    "this arrangement preserves the format of photometric data available on our internet site .",
    "we shall analyze the three stars to find out how their radial velocities deviate from purely orbital motion and combine these results with photometry to assess what forms the pulsations and proximity effects take in them .",
    "the great precision of our ast data lets us solve velocity curves of these three long - period binaries and look for deviations from elliptical orbits .",
    "table 4 gives the results for the three stars , listing the usual spectroscopic elements . for 31  cyg",
    "we have only about one - third of a full orbital cycle of data , so we have combined our data with those listed by wright & huffman ( 1968 ) and weighted all the data equally .",
    "the solution to this combined data set is the same as wright & huffman s to within the putative errors .",
    "the difference between the spectroscopic period we have derived and the photometric period ( 1.8  d ) corresponds to a shift of @xmath160.21 km  s@xmath5  of wright & huffman s velocities with respect to ours .",
    "this shift gives a flavor of the kind of uncertainties that indeterminate zero - point shifts introduce into orbital analyses .",
    "the values of the major elements ( @xmath17 , @xmath3 , and @xmath18 ) for both @xmath0  aur and 32  cyg agree with previous determinations to within the likely errors of those determinations . in particular , they agree with griffin s ( 2005 ) values for @xmath0  aur to within 2@xmath19 of his formal errors . for 32  cyg , they should be a significant improvement on the elements of wright ( 1970 ) , with which they agree to within the likely errors of that analysis .",
    "this excellent agreement means that the shapes and orientations of the orbits of both stars are known well enough to support rigorous analyses of their atmospheric eclipses , driven nonradial pulsations , and eclipse timings .",
    "figure 1 shows the velocity curves of the three stars .",
    "all three are obviously variable with non - orbital shifts superimposed on the dominant orbital velocities .",
    "figure 2 shows the time dependence of these deviations , which can be rather extreme .",
    "the 250 d , 0.75 km  s@xmath5 , deviation of 31  cyg around 53700 , for instance , if pulsational , would correspond to a 23 @xmath20  change in the stellar radius , about 12% , even without any allowance for foreshortening .",
    "alternatively , it could represent some sort of truly global circulation .",
    "the variation seen in figure 2 seems cyclic on timescales of 100300 d , so one might suspect that some of it could be seasonal observational effects .",
    "however , the major effects do not correlate very well in 31 and 32  cyg , which we observed over the same observing season , occasionally on the same nights , and there is absolutely no hint of such effects in velocities of hd  14214 at levels above 0.05 km  s@xmath5  ( eaton & williamson 2007 ) .",
    "three other k supergiants observed over roughly the same time interval , @xmath21  peg ( k2  ib ) , @xmath22  cyg ( k45 ib - ii ) , and 63  cyg ( k4 ib - iia ) , show long - term variations at least as great as the three binaries , although we have far fewer data for these single stars .",
    "we have used two techniques to look for periodicity in the residuals . in the first , using a program written by d.  s.  hall , we fit sine curves for a spectrum of periods to the data [ @xmath10@xmath23 = @xmath24@xmath25(2@xmath26hjd/@xmath27 + @xmath28 ) ] and identified minima of @xmath29  of these fits as possible periods . in the second",
    ", we applied the techniques of vanek ( 1971 ) , as we have for the multiperiodic @xmath7  doradus stars ( e.g. , kaye et al .",
    "1999 ; henry et al .",
    "this second approach lets us reliably find multiple periodicites without  prewhitening , \" an advantage , especially in the low - frequency domain .",
    "we searched for periods in the range 11200  d. both methods identified essentially the same periods , but , because the second method gives more systematic results , we will use them in the following analysis . table 5 lists the periods found and amplitudes of sinusoids fit to the data for them . if the velocity variation represents a radial pulsation , we may integrate the ( sinusoidal ) variation over half a cycle to get the total excursion in radius , @xmath10@xmath30 = @xmath22@xmath31/@xmath32 , where @xmath22 @xmath33 1.35 is a correction for the fact that expansion of most of the disc is only partially in the line of sight ( e.g. , gray & stevenson 2007 ) .",
    "the periods derived here likely reflect the timescales of some physical phenomena in these stars but not truely coherent long - duration pulsations .",
    "this is especially so for the longest periods , those comparable to the @xmath21200  d duration of our observations .",
    "additional tests for shorter periods ( 0.031.0  d ) with the method of vanek found none , as expected .",
    "if the cool components of these binaries were rotating synchronously , they would have significant rotational velocities , @xmath34  = ( 1 + 2)1/a for synchronous rotation with the usual assumptions about orientation of the motions . for pseudosynchronous rotation ( hut 1981 ; hall 1986 ) , the velocity would be even bigger . for @xmath0  aur , the values would be 8.3 and 16.6 km  s@xmath5 , respectively , with the enhancement for pseudosynchronous rotation calculated with hut s eq .  42 .",
    "rotational velocities , hence line broadening , for the other two systems would be less , an unobservable @xmath34  = 2.71 and 3.6 km  s@xmath5   for 31  cyg , for example , although it should be observable for 32  cyg at @xmath34  = 6.50 and 10.4 ( or 10 and 15 if we adopt the much bigger relative radius implied by tidal distortion ) .",
    "if @xmath0  aur were rotating pseudosynchronously , we could easily detect it by comparing profiles of its metallic lines with those in 31  cyg and other , single , stars .",
    "a couple of well exposed single spectra of @xmath0  aur and 31  cyg do not show shallower , hence broader , lines in @xmath0  aur than in 31  cyg , nor do the spectra of @xmath0  aur binaries and other k supergiants plotted by eaton ( 1995 , fig .",
    "a19 ) show an apparent difference in depths of strong metallic lines .",
    "to get an idea of the magnitude of the expected broadening , we artificially broadened a spectrum of the k2  ib supergiant @xmath21  peg to @xmath34  = 8.3 and 16.6 km  s@xmath5  and compared the line profiles in the broadened spectra with unbroadened profiles .",
    "both values gave measurably shallower lines , by 10 and 30% , respectively .    to quantify this result ,",
    "we have looked at the strengths and depths of strong metallic lines in three other cool supergiants , @xmath21  peg , @xmath22  cyg , and 63  cyg , plotting them up with composite spectra for the three @xmath0  aur binaries for phases when the k supergiants were not illuminated by their b companions .",
    "depths of strong 1 lines in the three single stars vary by @xmath2 2% .",
    "the lines in @xmath0  aur itself in these composites were actually somewhat shallower than in most of the other stars , but by only of the order of 3% .",
    "this implies a rotational velocity @xmath2 30% synchronous , or 2.5 km  s@xmath5 . on the other hand , 32  cyg , which ought to be rotating about as fast as @xmath0  aur , has lines as deep as in any of the single stars .",
    "another way to gauge the rotation in these systems is to look for shifts of shell lines formed in the lower chromosphere during the atmospheric eclipses .",
    "many investigators have done this .",
    "griffin et al .",
    "( 1990 ) argued they had found a displacement 8.5 km  s@xmath5 , corresponding to synchronous rotation , in a single precise observation of @xmath0  aur .",
    "earlier measurements of such displacements in @xmath0  aur were not so clear cut .",
    "mckellar & petrie ( 1952 ) found that metallic lines in a 1950 eclipse gave displacements of only 2.5 km  s@xmath5 , possibly from rotation much slower than synchronous .",
    "wilson & abt ( 1954 ) found positive shifts in ingress and negative shifts in egress , as expected for rotation , but these shifts came with significant scatter and a temporal dependence different from that of rotation .",
    "mckellar & butkov ( 1956 ) found that lines of ionized metals in the near ultraviolet , which would be unblended with photospheric lines , followed the velocity of the k star to a few km  s@xmath5  in 19551956 .",
    "bauer ( 1994 ) reviewed the evidence for 31  cyg , finding that velocities of the metallic shell lines ( e.g. , 1 ) were always about the same as the orbital velocity and that in most cases the differences were not consistent with rotation . because it has a grazing total eclipse ,",
    "32  cyg might not be expected to show rotational displacements of metallic shell lines , and it does not ( wright & hesse 1969 ) .",
    "these stars are clearly not rotating pseudosynchronously , or even synchronously _ unless the single stars are rotating much faster than generally thought _ , and we see no convincing evidence they are rotating significantly faster than single stars . in conducting this analysis ,",
    "we have implicitly assumed that single k supergiants are not rotating , inasmuch as we have no theoretically calculated comparison spectra for such stars , nor would we trust them if we did .",
    "analyses of bright giants ( class ii stars ) by gray & toner ( 1986a ) find rotation @xmath34@xmath35 3 km  s@xmath5 , although gray & toner ( 1987 ) find higher rotation ( @xmath34@xmath35 7 km  s@xmath5 ) for the class ib supergiants .",
    "eventually it ought to be possible to directly test the idea that k supergiants are rotating at rates like those inferred by gray & toner by using more precisely measured velocities of chromospheric shell lines in these binaries .",
    "guinan & mccook ( 1979 ) analyzed the light outside eclipse for 32  cyg and concluded they had found the ellipsoidal variation of that star .",
    "fredrick ( 1960 , fig .",
    "4 ) had previously detected variation looking like ellipsoidal variation on the even longer period of vv  cep .",
    "figure 3 shows the measured brightnesses of the three stars over the past 4.0 years in the @xmath13 band ; data for @xmath12 are similar .",
    "we seem to have detected the ellipsoidal variation of both @xmath0  aur and 32  cyg , along with its strong periastron effect around primary eclipse .",
    "the phase dependence for 32  cyg is not as clear cut as in @xmath0  aur or in guinan & mccook s photometry , probably because of intrinsic variation . however , these two sets of photometry for 32  cyg actually agree fairly well , especially close to periastron .",
    "our data for 32  cyg for the last two seasons illustrated have unexpected shifts that mask the periastron effect to some extent .",
    "the light curve for 31  cyg is incomplete , although it does show a sinusoidal wave ( p = 1200  d ) over our period of observation that is not consistent with ellipsoidal variation . if this wave actually results from variation of their common comparison star , correcting for it would make the brightness of 32  cyg more consistent with the calculated ellipsoidal variation .",
    "the theoretical curves plotted in figure 3 represent the ellipsoidal variation for these binaries calculated with the wilson  devinney code roughly for the elements given in tables 1 and 4 .",
    "they assume the stars are hardly rotating ( 0.1 synchronous ) and incorporate the usual assumptions about the surface brightness , namely linear limb darkening ( @xmath36=0.80 ) and lucy s ( 1967 ) convective gravity darkening . however , it is not clear that a star with a driven non - radial pulsation could legitimately have its surface - brightness distribution specified by gravity darkening .",
    "gravity darkening is an equilibrium , diffusive theory that supposes timescales much longer than the typical pulsation , driven or intrinsic .",
    "furthermore , we know that pulsating stars can have a complicated , double - valued dependence of temperature on radius . if we assume to first order that _ radially _ pulsating stars are both apparently brighter and hotter when they are smaller , we might parameterize their variation of surface brightness , @xmath37 , with gravity , @xmath38@xmath2@xmath39 , as gravity darkening [ @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath41 @xmath43 .",
    "then the gravity exponent , @xmath44 , would be @xmath2 1.0 for such a star to stay the same brightness as it pulsates .",
    "adiabatic pulsation would give a much higher effective value of @xmath44 .",
    "intrinsically driven pulsations of stars are far from adiabatic , and this leads to phase lags between the radial compression and the star s brightness , which depend on details of the star s structure and driving mechanism ( e.g. , szab , buchler , & bartee 2007 ) .",
    "non - radial pulsators are theoretically more complicated because horizontal motions relieve horizontal pressure variations , at least for non - radial pulsation much slower than the natural frequency of the star .",
    "buta & smith ( 1979 ) calculated the light variations of non - radial pulsators , finding that these horizontal adjustments greatly reduce the temperature variations predicted by dziembowski s ( 1971 ) theory for adiabatic pulsation .",
    "in fact , they found that geometrical effects alone can explain most of the light variations of some actual non - radially pulsating stars .",
    "furthermore , their calculations implied that the temperature variation might well be period dependent .",
    "what phase lags one might expect of non - radial pulsation is also open to conjecture ( e.g.   townsend 2003 ) .",
    "theory obviously does not give us especially good guidance for predicting how temperature varies over the surface of a star with a driven pulsation .",
    "we may get a better idea of how flux depends on gravity as a star pulsates by considering some actual pulsating stars . as a first stab at doing this , we have looked at analyses of @xmath45  cep stars , which are often suspected of having nonradial pulsations ( e.g. , stamford & watson 1977 ; odell 1980 ) .",
    "calculations used to predict the complicated line profiles for assumed pulsation modes ( e.g. , stamford & watson 1976 ) often do not even include the effect of pulsation - induced effective temperature variations .",
    "however , we can get an estimate of that effect in an actual star by using kubiak s ( 1972 ) analysis of bw  vul as an example .",
    "the values of effective temperature and effective gravity in his table 6 , admittedly somewhat double valued , give a slope of @xmath10log/@xmath10log @xmath33 0.18 , or g @xmath33 0.7 .",
    "this is larger than one might expect form extant theories of gravity darkening , but even contact components of algol binaries , which seem to conform to the assumptions behind the theory , seem to require @xmath44 @xmath2 0.5 , somewhat larger than lucy s 0.32 ( eaton 2008 ) .    the data for @xmath0  aur in figure 3 and geometry derived by bennett et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are precise enough to give a crude test of the theory incorporated into the wilson - devinney code .",
    "the solid curve is calculated for @xmath46=0.163  is the radius in the orbital plane perpendicular to the line between the centers of the two stars , measured in units of the orbital separation ( semimajor axis ) . ]",
    "( 148 @xmath20 ) with @xmath44=0.32 .",
    "the dashed curve represents the case @xmath46=0.163 with @xmath44=1.0 .",
    "the calculated phase dependence is excellent , meaning that there is no appreciable phase lag in the non - radial pulsation .",
    "the calculated amplitude is too small for @xmath44=0.32 but somewhat large for @xmath44=1.0 . from this evidence",
    ", it appears the effective gravity darkening is @xmath44 @xmath33 0.70.8 .",
    "the theory thus seems to work to first order and restricts the radius to better than about 10% , as we judge for other calculations for @xmath30 = 130 and 182 @xmath20 .",
    "the theory fails to predict the ellipsoidal variation of 32  cyg , however , and this failure implies the radius must be much bigger than thought , as guinan & mccook found in their own analysis , or the gravity darkening must be _ much _ larger than allowed by @xmath0  aur .",
    "we have plotted the predicted variation for two cases in figure 3 , @xmath30=217 @xmath20  ( dashed ) and @xmath30=271 @xmath20  ( solid ) , both for @xmath44 = 0.7 .",
    "the radius required to fit the amplitude with @xmath44=0.7 is @xmath46=0.23@xmath60.02 ( 260@xmath620@xmath20 ) .",
    "the phase dependence of the periastron effect might be improved with a bigger eccentricity .",
    "however , the orbital elements are known very reliably from the radial velocities , and we therefore see no justification for using @xmath3 as an aphysical fitting parameter in a light - curve solution .",
    "our rather crude analysis of the tidal distortion is about all anyone could expect to do without a much better theory of the surface brightness of these stars with driven pulsations .",
    "cool giants as a group seem to be pulsating , and the supergiant components of @xmath0  aur binaries should be no exception .",
    "our new photometry has very little evidence of pulsation beyond that driven by tides , but the radial velocities plotted in figure 2 show unmistakable evidence of cyclic , if not periodic , variation in all three stars ( see table 5 ) .    as for the photometry",
    ", it is difficult to detect long - term periods in any of these stars because of the strong , somewhat poorly modelled ellipsoidal light variation . there is obvious deviation from the calculated light curves in figure 3 .",
    "thirty - two cyg seems to have a coherent sinusoidal pulse of 105  d period around 53125 , which may have been a random pulsation .",
    "there seems to have been an anticorrelated change in the radial velocity , but the data sets did not overlap very well for that year , and they were rather noisy at the level of this effect",
    ". there also seems to be quasiperiodic variation of the brightness on shorter periods ( e.g. , near 53500 ) but at the level of the noise in these data .",
    "we may estimate the pulsational periods expected for these stars by using theoretical pulsational constants ( e.g. , fox & wood 1982 ) [ @xmath47  ] and mean densities derived from the information in table 1 .",
    "all three stars have roughly the same mean density , which is about one - tenth that of @xmath1  tau .",
    "we would thus expect longer pulsational periods , by several times , than found in the normal giants .",
    "values are @xmath48/@xmath27 = 1.34 , 1.23 , and 1.35 @xmath49 10@xmath50 , respectively , for @xmath0  aur , and 31 and 32  cyg .",
    "the expected fundamental periods ( @xmath48@xmath20.080.18 ) would be near 100 d , and the first overtone ( @xmath48@xmath20.030.04 ) , near 25 d. alternatively , we can invert this process and calculate @xmath48 s for observed periods to get the values listed in the fifth column of table 5 .",
    "these values are much larger than expected from any known pulsational mechanism , and are reminiscent of the unexplained long - period variations observed in many agb stars ( wood , olivier , & kawaler 2004 ; hinkle et al .",
    "2002 ) .    whether the periodic variations we see in the radial velocities represent pulsation or",
    "some other phenomenon is open to conjecture . given the lack of _ photometric _ variation correlated with these variations of the radial velocities , we think it unlikely that the velocities result from pulsation of the stars .",
    "the aforementioned 105  d pulse of 32  cyg has the right length for the radial fundamental , especially if we accept the reality of the apparent pulses at periods closer to the first overtone .",
    "this pulse has an amplitude @xmath2  0.5 km  s@xmath5  peak - to - peak , giving an excursion of only 1.9  @xmath20 , or about 0.71.1% of the radius of the star .",
    "likewise , the apparent 125  d periodicity in the radial velocities of 31  cyg , if a radial pulsation , implies that the radius changes by 0.7  @xmath20 , or 0.4% .",
    "some of the longer periods detected in radial velocities , however , imply much bigger changes in radius , the 429 d periodicity of 32  cyg ( 0.4 km  s@xmath5  peak - to - peak ) , for example , corresponding to 4.4  @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the singular excursion in the velocity of 31  cyg near 53700 corresponds to a change of @xmath5112% of the radius , if pulsational .",
    "if the changes in radius implied by cyclic radial velocities reflect radial pulsation , they must affect the timing of eclipses , and there is some evidence of this effect in the literature .",
    "when the radius of the star changes by 12% , the duration of total eclipse must also change by a comparable amount , roughly 0.5  d in systems like @xmath0  aur and 31  cyg , so eclipse timings would give a way of testing for the existence of pulsations .",
    "the problem here is that eclipse timing is very difficult to measure in these systems , and the typical photometric analysis is compromised by being pieced together from data from many sources for the same eclipse .",
    "the best results seem to be for 31  cyg , for which stencel et al .",
    "( 1984 ) determined times very precisely for the eclipses of 1962 and 1982 .",
    "we can use their precise ephemeris to predict times in the 2004 eclipse observed with the apt and place a limit on how much the timing varies .",
    "their @xmath52 for ingress of 1982 , extrapolated forward by 2 cycles , agrees with our observations to at least @xmath60.1  d. this is a @xmath60.3% change in the semiduration , or @xmath2 0.6 @xmath20  in radius .",
    "a reflection effect in these stars could take several forms , ( 1 ) heating of the atmosphere , detectable in changes of temperature - sensitive line ratios with phase , ( 2 ) increased ionization of the photosphere , detectable in weakening of very strong lines like 1 d and strengthening of lines of singly ionized species , and ( 3 ) higher ionization in the chromosphere , detectable as a change in h@xmath1probably an increase in its strength .    to look for effects of direct heating of the atmosphere",
    ", we have made composites of spectra of @xmath0  aur and 32  cyg at phases when the b star is behind the k star and when it is in front . if there are any differences in the photospheric absorption lines , they are very subtle .",
    "we looked for enhancements of such potentially sensitive lines as 2 @xmath536416.93 and 6432.68 , finding a possible _ very _ slight enhancement with the hot star in front .",
    "the 1 d lines may have been a bit weaker in the irradiated spectrum of 32  cyg , and h@xmath1 was definitely stronger in both stars , as seen in figure 4 .",
    "direct heating of the chromosphere by the b star could potentially change the strength of h@xmath1 .",
    "there are at least two ways h@xmath1 might vary in cool supergiants , ( 1 ) an overall change in the mass of the @xmath2 hydrostatic chromosphere where the bulk of the line forms ( e.g. , cram & mullan 1979 ) and ( 2 ) an enhancement of the blue wing in the stellar wind ( e.g. , mallik 1993 ) , which is observed occasionally in supergiants ( e.g. , smith & dupree 1988 ; eaton & henry 1996 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the time / phase dependence of h@xmath1 in these three stars .",
    "we see variations much greater than the expected observational errors or the variations expected in normal ( class iii ) giants .",
    "the few single supergiants and bright giants measured by eaton ( 1995 ) showed a much greater range of equivalent width , however , and the values for our three @xmath0  aur components fall into that range .",
    "furthermore , the three supergiants @xmath21  peg , @xmath22  cyg , and 63  cyg have fluctuations of this amount during the same span of time",
    ". the phase dependence of h@xmath1 in the three binaries does not correlate neatly with their orbits .",
    "the strong enhancement seen in 32  cyg over the range 5320053550 , for instance , occurred roughly when the cool star s irradiated face was pointing towards us , but its superior conjunction was near the end of this range , and the range does not coincide at all well with the time between the ascending and descending nodes , marked in the figure .",
    "our new data for these stars show very few of the eruptions / enhancements of winds seen in other supergiants .",
    "there are 4 instances of enhanced absorption in the blue wing of h@xmath1 apparent in figure 5 .",
    "an enhancement for @xmath0  aur near 53840 seems to be a real change in the stellar profile .",
    "the elevation for 31  cyg near 53800 is also probably stellar , as well .",
    "however , the high points for 32  cyg marked  ? \" in the figure are probably telluric , and the high points for 31  cyg near 54000 could be also .",
    "on the other hand , the general enhancement in the absorption after 53500 for 31  cyg seems to reflect a genuine change in the profile .",
    "the photometry and radial velocities of these three stars raise more questions about pulsation than they answer . in only one very restricted case",
    "do we see something like a pulsation in both the brightness and radial velocity of the star .",
    "this pulse in 32  cyg may have been a radial pulsation of the k star , and the same star shows flickering on shorter timescales , at the level of the photometric errors , that may be pulsation in overtones .",
    "the roughly coherent variation of 31  cyg s radial velocity at 125  d may also reflect pulsation , but it is not accompanied by changes in the brightness .",
    "radial pulsation at the 12% level is consistent with eclipse timings in these stars .",
    "the k supergiants in these systems fall in a part of the hr diagram with rather low pulsation ( e.g. , maeder 1980 ; henry et al .",
    "stars with lower masses are generally stable in their lower radial modes but become increasingly susceptable to pulsation in high overtones ( xiong & deng 2007 ) .",
    "such high overtones are a possible source of the apparently random flickering of the rather stable k giants and supergiants .",
    "one way to get a better idea of the level of any changes in radius from pulsation is to look critically at the timing and duration of eclipses , as we have illustrated with three eclipses of 31  cyg .",
    "we do not think the existing data are good enough to do this in any meaningful way . however , this approach should be possible with photometry from robotic telescopes , but it would take a communal effort over many years .",
    "other changes in both brightness and velocity are completely inconsistent with the known stability of light variation of these systems and with the expected pulsations of their k components .",
    "especially perplexing is the 200-day drop in velocity of 31  cyg , corresponding to a 12% change in the star s radius .",
    "this kind of change would be accompanied by changes of several days in the eclipse timing .",
    "it is much more likely to be a nonpulsational change in the circulation of the star s atmosphere , like the famous starpatch in @xmath22  boo  a ( toner & gray 1988 ) . the range of photospheric velocity caused by granulation or other flows in cooler supergiants ( gray & toner 1985 , 1986a , 1986b ; 1987 ) seems big enough ( @xmath2 610 km  s@xmath5 ) to admit fluctuations at the level we are observing .",
    "however , once again we are thus reminded that  there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in [ our ] philosophy . \"",
    "all three of these stars had photometric variations on timescales longer than expected for pulsation .",
    "thirty - one cyg showed a 1250  d sinusoidal variation in our photometry , covering @xmath2 the length of our observations .",
    "there is no mechanism for producing this effect , and it may simply reflect variation of the comparison star . both @xmath0  aur and 32  cyg also had variations in brightness beyond their ellipsoidal variation .",
    "cool components in these three classical systems seem to be rotating no faster than similar single supergiants .",
    "in contrast , griffin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and eaton & shaw ( 2007 ) found evidence the chromosphere of 22  vul is rotating _",
    "faster _ than synchronously .",
    "this is a close binary in a circular orbit , which may have been a much closer , interacting system in a previous visit to the giant branch .",
    "likewise , the supergiant component of the relatively close but eccentric binary hr  6902 ( g9  ii+b8  v ) seems to be rotating even faster than pseudosynchronously ( griffin & griffin 1986 ) .",
    "these rotational velocities would seem to be an important clue to the evolutionary history of supergiant binaries once somebody becomes clever enough to interpret them .",
    "we have detected the ellipsoidal variation and its periastron effect in two of the stars and used it to discuss how the driven nonradial pulsations in such a star should change the surface brightness . in this context",
    ", we question the use of the concept of gravity darkening in such stars and propose a methodology for determining an effective gravity darkening for such pulsations .",
    "we find the light variations of @xmath0  aur require larger gravity darkening than predicted by lucy s ( 1967 ) diffusive theory . along these same lines",
    ", we may have detected a chromospheric reflection effect in the h@xmath1 strength .",
