    "due to their promising applications in a wide range of areas , ultracold ground - state polar molecules with high phase - space density have been pursued intensively in the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "although recent years have seen significant progress in direct laser cooling of ground - state molecules  @xcite , the most successful way of producing near - quantum - degeneracy molecular samples is still association of ultracold atoms with the help of magnetic feshbach resonances  @xcite . with a properly designed",
    "two - photon stimulated raman process , the weakly - bound molecules formed can be transferred to the lowest energy level of the molecular ground state with the high initial phase - space density preserved  @xcite .",
    "this was successfully implemented for @xmath6k@xmath1rb molecule  @xcite in 2008 , and very recently for @xmath1rb@xmath7cs  @xcite and @xmath0na@xmath6k  @xcite molecules . for @xmath6k@xmath1rb",
    ", two - body chemical reaction can happen , which induces large inelastic losses  @xcite .",
    "@xmath1rb@xmath7cs and @xmath0na@xmath6k are stable against two - body chemical reactions  @xcite , but other loss mechanisms may still exist  @xcite .",
    "the bosonic @xmath0na@xmath1rb molecule in its ground state is also chemically stable against two - body collisions  @xcite . besides , it possesses a permanent electric dipole moment of 3.3 debye , larger than all the aforementioned molecules  @xcite .",
    "it is thus another important candidate for investigating ultracold polar molecules . in the past two years",
    ", we have prepared an ultracold mixture of @xmath0na and @xmath1rb  @xcite and studied their feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have successfully produced @xmath0na@xmath1rb feshbach molecules by sweeping the magnetic field across a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "the next critical step for making ground - state @xmath0na@xmath1rb molecules is to find a path for an efficient stimulated raman process . as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] , the internuclear distances between the ground - state and the feshbach molecules are vastly different .",
    "besides , as our feshbach molecules are mainly of triplet character , the intermediate level must have strong triplet / singlet mixing to make the connection to the @xmath8 state .",
    "thus , for this task , a detailed understanding of the excited states is necessary .",
    "historically , @xmath0na@xmath1rb has been a popular molecule for spectroscopic study .",
    "the two electronic ground states , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , were investigated in detail with fourier transform spectroscopy  @xcite and further refined by measurement of the feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "several low - lying excited states shown in fig.[fig1 ] , including @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite were also well studied by various conventional spectroscopy methods .",
    "however , as is typical for conventional molecular spectroscopy , the long - range parts of the excited state potentials are not covered well . in this work ,",
    "we study the long - range states near the na(@xmath13)+rb(@xmath14 ) asymptote starting from feshbach molecules which are weakly bound with a large amplitude vibrational motion and is thus a nice choice for this purpose . besides its importance in understanding fundamental molecular dynamics , this work is also an important step toward finding the intermediate level for raman transfer .",
    "one of the primary choices satisfying our requirements is the strongly mixed levels of the @xmath10 and @xmath15 admixture  @xcite .",
    "as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the equilibrium distance of the @xmath8 state matches well with the classical inner turning points of some high vibrational levels of the @xmath10 and @xmath15 mixture ; thus favorable strengths are expected for both the pump and dump transitions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] , we describe our feshbach molecule preparation system and the spectroscopy setup . in sec .",
    "[ result ] and sec .  [ discussion ] , we show the high resolution spectrum and our analysis . sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] concludes the article .",
    "the experiment reported here is carried out on the same setup as our previous works  @xcite . after preparing the ultracold mixture of na and rb atoms in their @xmath16 hyperfine states in an optical dipole trap ,",
    "we perform magneto - association by sweeping the magnetic field across the inter - species feshbach resonance located at 347.8 g. after removing residual atoms , we typically end up with about 1500 feshbach molecules with a temperature of 450 nk , which is the starting point for the current work .",
    "the final magnetic field is at 340 g , where the molecules have a binding energy of @xmath17 mhz and about 80@xmath18 closed channel fraction .",
    "the trap lifetime of the pure molecule sample is more than 20 ms  @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic laser is a free - running external cavity diode laser with a maximum power of 50 mw and a typical linewidth of 2 mhz .",
    "its frequency is measured by a wavelength meter ( highfinesse , ws7 ) with an absolute accuracy of 60 mhz .",
    "the laser beam propagates perpendicular to the magnetic field and is focused to a waist of @xmath1945 @xmath20 m . as the transition strength varies with the binding energy , we adjust the laser power to maintain similar loss ratios over the whole scan range . for the strongest transitions ,",
    "@xmath21 100 @xmath20w power is enough to deplete all the feshbach molecules .",
    "the typical excitation duration is 100 @xmath20s , much shorter than the trap lifetime .",
    "we obtain the bound - bound spectrum by tuning the spectroscopic laser from 12816.5 @xmath22 to 12806 @xmath22 with typical steps of 50 mhz .",
    "after the excitation , we ramp the magnetic field back to dissociate the remaining feshbach molecules , as our absorption detection is only sensitive to atoms . we have to prepare a new sample after each cycle , which takes about 45 seconds .",
    "our detuning measurements are all made with respect to the transition from the ground - state hyperfine asymptote @xmath0na(3@xmath23 , @xmath24 ) + @xmath1rb(5@xmath23 , @xmath24 ) to the center of gravity of the na(@xmath13)+rb(@xmath14 ) asymptote .",
    "after taking the zeeman shifts at 340 g into account , the excited - state asymptotic limit is taken as 12816.724 @xmath22 .",
    "the small binding energy of the feshbach molecules is neglected .",
    "in fig .  [ fig2 ] we show the whole spectrum near the na(@xmath13)+rb(@xmath14 ) asymptote . levels with detuning less than -1.2 @xmath22 are not resolved , probably due to the very dense and strong resonances near this region , as well as predissociation - induced broadening which we will discuss below . at a first glance",
    ", the spectrum seems rather complex , reflecting the fact that there are 5 attractive long - range potentials , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , associated with this asymptote .",
    "here we are using the hund s case ( c ) notation typical for such long - range molecules , with the number in the parenthesis representing @xmath30 , the projection of the total angular momentum of the electrons on the molecular axis , and the first number their order with increasing energy in this symmetry .    scrutinizing the lineshape patterns and level spacings ,",
    "we have picked out 4 vibrational series from the spectrum and listed them in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "one key to achieve sensible assignments is the well resolved hyperfine and zeeman structures for @xmath31 states . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and ( b ) , vibrational levels in two of the identified series have sharp sub - structures . to tell which state they belong to",
    ", we compare our spectrum to calculated vibrational levels based on the rydberg - klein - rees ( rkr ) potential of @xmath10 state given by pashov et al . in ref .",
    "the 4(1 ) state is correlated to the @xmath10 state at long range .",
    "good matching to the series including the level in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a is found by an overall -0.15 @xmath22 shift of the calculated vibrational levels .",
    "this series is thus assigned to the 4(1 ) state .    .",
    "summary of the observed long - range vibrational levels near the na(@xmath13)+rb(@xmath14 ) asymptote .",
    "the @xmath32 index is deduced from a leroy - bernstein fit ( see text ) .",
    "note that @xmath33 represents the highest vibrational level .",
    "the linewidths of levels with predissociation are also listed . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    the uncertainties of our results for the @xmath5 coefficients can be discussed by estimating the contribution of the next term in the multipolar expansion of the long - range interaction energy , i.e @xmath34 . at the internuclear distance of 30 @xmath35 already reached by several of the observed vibrational levels , and using @xmath36 values from ref.@xcite , this term amounts for a noticeable fraction of about 11@xmath18 of the van der waals energy . however",
    ", a fitting using an improved lb formula  @xcite including both @xmath37 and @xmath34 contributions does not give satisfactory results as there are too many free parameters compared to the number of observed lines .",
    "we believe that scanning for deeper bound levels will not help to improve the results , as we are already close to the internuclear distance where exchange potential and higher order terms in the multipolar expansion should play a role .",
    "thus we will have uncertainties on our @xmath5 values because we are at the limit of what we can do with the lb formula .",
    "we also note that the lb formula should be applied to molecules in zero magnetic field only , while our spectra are taken at 340 g. the zeeman and hyperfine interactions result in complicated structures corresponding to successive series converging in principle toward different hyperfine zeeman dissociation limits , such that application of the lb formula , strictly speaking , is impossible . in this work , we defined a center of gravity for each structured line assuming equal weighting of all observed substructures , and the detuning ( binding energy ) corresponding to this center of gravity is determined with respect to the single dissociation limit as defined in sec.[experiment ] .",
    "although both the zeeman shift and the overall substructure width are much smaller than the vibrational level spaces , the @xmath5 values extracted could still be slightly distorted .",
    "a sample of ultracold feshbach molecules is a good starting point for investigating excited - state molecular potentials with very high resolution , especially for long - range states hard to access with thermal samples . in this work",
    "we have investigated the near dissociation levels of the @xmath0na@xmath1rb molecule correlated with the na(@xmath13)+rb(@xmath14 ) asymptote and observed the 5 long - range states with attractive potentials .",
    "we have extracted the @xmath5 coefficients with the lb model and found reasonable agreements with previous theoretical calculations .    however , the current study is already covering internuclear distances violating the long range model .",
    "thus the experimental @xmath5 parameters are a kind of `` effective '' parameters which already include significant contributions from short - range potentials .",
    "similar difficulties were already met on the lik long - range state analysis  @xcite .",
    "this situation is probably quite true for such molecules with light reduced masses ( and thus a smaller density of states ) . to better match the experimental values ,",
    "the asymptotic models for calculating the van der waals coefficients will need some refinements .",
    "in particular , such models predict identical @xmath5 values for molecular states  @xcite , which is not what we found experimentally .    in future works , extension of this spectroscopy to much deeper levels matching the range already addressed by conventional spectroscopy should be feasible .",
    "combining these works together will lead to a full understanding of the relevant excited states and help us identify the suitable intermediate levels for raman population transfer to the ground state .",
