    "the full optimal potential has a second peak at @xmath107 and both the height of the peaks and the linear slopes between the peaks diverge .",
    "a finite peak potential is not a @xmath108-function , but can be considered as a result of a limiting process from a triangular shape , see fig .",
    "[ fig : peaklimit ] .",
    "it is important that the peak arises at the discontinuity of the temperature profile , namely that the rising side of the peak is in one temperature area and the other side is in the other temperature area .",

    "since the peak has infinitesimally small width , the forward rate is not decreased by a higher peak potential , contrary to a rising barrier with finite width .",
    "a finite peak in a constant temperature area would not contribute to integrals and thus would have no effect on mean first passage times .",
    "in contrast , for a dichotomous temperature profile and a finite peak at the interface , mean first passage times involving a crossing of the peak are affected by its height . the backward mean first passage time increases exponentially with the peak height .",
    "in contrast and somewhat counter - intuitively , the forward mean first passage time decreases with increasing peak height due to the strong suppression of peak recrossings from the cold side .",
    "a finite peak with height @xmath109 superimposed on a flat potential causes a depletion of the particles on the high temperature side and an accumulation on the other side . with increasing peak height @xmath109 ,",

    "[ fig : peakdis ] . in a sawtooth potential ,",

    "[ fig : sawpeak ] .",
    "if we combine both effects by superimposing a finite peak on a sawtooth potential , the depletion can compensate the accumulation , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sawpeak ] .",
    "the compensation of the accumulation is the main reason for the divergent current . for a sawtooth potential with large amplitude",
    ", the particles would accumulate in front of the barriers .",
    "the peaks counteract this effect and allow the particles to overcome the barriers . in between the peaks , the particles ( on average ) follow the steep potential with large mean velocity . for finer discretization ,",
    "the peaks get larger and the potential in between steeper corresponding to a stronger force which increases the mean velocity and thus the current .",
    "this behavior is only valid under the assumption of an overdamped dynamics where the particle instantaneously adjusts its velocity according to the langevin equation ( [ eq : leover ] ) . in the underdamped case",
    ", the particle needs a certain distance to reach the velocity corresponding to the local force .",
    "the overdamped limit is a good approximation as long as the relaxation time of the momentum @xmath110 is small compared to the ( mean ) time @xmath111 it takes for the particle to cross a region with basically constant force .",
    "considering the potential above with discretization @xmath97 , both the peaks and the linear slopes between the peaks should not become too large for the overdamped limit to be appropriate .",
    "the peaks constitute the largest slope in the optimal potential and therefore are crucial for the appropriateness of the overdamped description . considering a peak with height @xmath109 and width @xmath112",
    ", the relaxation time @xmath113 should be small compared to @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the ( mean ) stationary velocity .",
    "therefore , the overdamped limit is approriate for @xmath116 for a given value of @xmath117 , the discretization @xmath97 thus can not become too small for the overdamped limit to be still valid . since the divergence of the current occurs with decreasing values of @xmath97 , the current presumably does not diverge in any realistic system , where the underlying dynamics is underdamped .",
    "this question , however , is hard to decide conclusively , since the current for underdamped dynamics can only be determined numerically for a given potential .",
    "the optimization of the potential ( with an infinite number of degrees of freedom ) is a computationally difficult task to be reserved to future work . for a colloidal particle of radius @xmath118 in a temperature profile with @xmath119 and periodicity @xmath120 ,",
    "we get @xmath121 where we have used stokes friction @xmath122 and the mass @xmath123 with viscosity @xmath124 and density @xmath125 . even for the finest discretization @xmath126 used in our study",
    ", we have @xmath127 and condition ( [ overd ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the overdamped description thus is valid for the optimal potential for any realistic ( finite ) temperature gradient .",
    "the ( large ) currents shown in fig . [ fig : pert ] thus are in principle observable in experiments , provided the necessary temperature jump can be generated on the scale of @xmath128 .",
    "a genuine divergence of the current , on the other hand , may be prohibited by the onset of inertia effects .",
    "using variational calculus , we have developed a method to calculate the optimal potential which maximizes the current in ratchet heat engines for a continuous temperature profile . in the load free case , we have shown that the maximum current depends linearly on the amplitude of the temperature profile .    in the case of a piecewise constant temperature ,",
    "the current diverges for the optimal potential consisting of steep linear parts and peaks at the boundaries which induce a long range effect in the probability distribution .",
    "however , the underlying assumption of an overdamped dynamic is limited by the slopes of the optimal potential presumably resulting in a bounded current for a particle with finite mass .",
