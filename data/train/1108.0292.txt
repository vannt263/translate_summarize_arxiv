    "high energy cosmic rays permeate the universe , but their origins remain uncertain . many types of acceleration sites have been suggested , such as supernova remnants , micro - quasars and active galactic nuclei ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "if such objects are sources of cosmic rays , high energy neutrinos may also be produced .",
    "these may be detected as a diffuse flux @xcite , but the observation of point - like sources of cosmic neutrinos would offer a unique opportunity to identify and study the sites and mechanisms of cosmic ray acceleration . in this paper ,",
    "results are presented of a search for cosmic point - like sources of high energy muon neutrinos performed with the first data taken by the antares telescope . located in the mediterranean sea ,",
    "the antares experiment is predominantly sensitive to neutrinos from the southern hemisphere in the tev to pev energy range .",
    "in particular , this allows the study of galactic sources and complements the icecube observatory , which primarily explores the northern hemisphere .",
    "the detection principle relies on measuring cherenkov light emitted by high energy charged particles that result from neutrino interactions inside or near the instrumented volume . in particular , charged current interactions of muon - neutrinos produce high energy muons .",
    "the muon direction closely follows that of the neutrino and can often be reconstructed with sub - degree accuracy .",
    "the large background from downgoing muons due to cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere is reduced by selecting only upgoing muons as neutrino candidates .",
    "the cherenkov light is detected by an array of photomultiplier tubes , each housed in a pressure resistant glass sphere called an optical module ( om ) @xcite .",
    "the oms are placed in storeys of triplets along vertical detector lines , which are anchored to the sea bed at a depth of 2475 meters with a spacing of approximately 60 meters .",
    "each of the 12 detector lines contains up to 25 storeys , separated by 14.5 meters .    the arrival time and charge of the photomultiplier signals",
    "are digitized @xcite into ` hits ' and transmitted to shore .",
    "an online filter identifies events containing muons within the data stream that otherwise consists of optical backgrounds due to natural radioactive decays and bioluminescence .",
    "the selected events are stored for offline reconstruction .",
    "a detailed description of the detector , the data acquisition and the online filtering algorithms is given in @xcite .",
    "the data presented here were collected between january 31st , 2007 and december 30th 2008 . during this time , the construction of the antares detector was still in progress .",
    "the detector consisted of 5 lines for most of 2007 and of 9 , 10 and 12 detector lines during 2008 .",
    "the total live time of the data used for the analysis is 304 days .",
    "( 144 , 38 , 48 and 74 days with 5 , 9 , 10 and 12 detector lines respectively ) .",
    "the online event selection identifies triplets of oms that detect multiple photons , either as a high - charge hit , or as hits separated by less than 20 ns on adjacent oms .",
    "at least 4 of such triplets are required throughout the detector , with the relative photon arrival times being compatible with the hypothesis of the light being emitted along the track of a relativistic particle .",
    "the arrival times of the hits are calibrated as described in @xcite .",
    "the inter - line timing has been measured in an iterative procedure by comparing the expected hit times to those measured in a large sample of reconstructed downgoing muons .",
    "in addition , a similar , independent measurement has been done using light from the optical beacon system , with compatible results .",
    "the positions and orientations of the oms vary because of the sea currents .",
    "an acoustic positioning system , combined with compasses and tiltmeters located along the detector lines , measures the positions and orientations of the oms , with an accuracy of @xmath310 cm .      from the timing and position information of the hits ,",
    "muon tracks are reconstructed using a multi - stage fitting procedure , based on @xcite .",
    "the initial fitting stages provide the hit selection and starting point for the final fit .",
    "the final stage consists of a maximum likelihood fit of the observed hit times and includes the contribution of optical background hits . in order to maximize the robustness against inaccuracies in the simulation of the optical background",
    ", the charge information of the hits is not used in the present analysis .",
    "neutrino candidates are selected from upgoing events using criteria that have been determined in a blind manner ; i.e. before performing the search analysis on the data .",
    "the criteria are chosen to optimize the sensitivity , which is defined as the expected median value of the upper limit on the neutrino flux . the angular uncertainty obtained from the muon track fit",
    "is required to be smaller than 1 degree .",
    "tracks are also required to have a good reconstruction quality .",
    "the latter is quantified by a parameter @xmath4 , which is based on the value of the likelihood function obtained for the fitted muon ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the cumulative distribution of @xmath4 for muons which are reconstructed as upgoing is shown in figure [ fig : lambda ] along with the simulated contributions from atmospheric muons and neutrinos .",
    "the simulation uses the ` bartol ' model @xcite for the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "the atmospheric muons are simulated by the qgsjet @xcite and corsika @xcite packages with the primary cosmic ray flux from @xcite .",
    "the final sample of neutrino candidates consists of 2190 upgoing events with @xmath5 and an angular uncertainty @xmath6 degree , which were selected out of a total of @xmath3 100 million ( down going ) reconstructed muons .",
    "the simulation indicates that the selected sample contains about 60% atmospheric neutrinos ; the rest are mis - reconstructed atmospheric muons .",
    "the agreement between data and simulation in the selected sample is well within the @xmath330% systematic uncertainty on the neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution and effective area of the detector for neutrinos passing the selection cuts have been determined using simulations and are shown in figure [ fig_angres ] .",
    "the simulations include the stochastic energy loss of muons via electromagnetic shower production , the propagation of cherenkov photons through sea water and a detailed simulation of the detector electronics .",
    "the cumulative distribution of the angle between the reconstructed muon direction and the neutrino direction is shown in figure [ fig_angres ] ( left panel ) for neutrino events with a neutrino spectrum proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the neutrino energy .",
    "the median of this angular error is 0.5 @xmath9 0.1 degrees . for the subset of data in which the full 12-line detector was operational ,",
    "the resolution is estimated to be @xmath10 degrees .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on this quantity has been estimated by varying the time resolution of the oms @xmath11 in the simulation .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath11 is determined by requiring that the @xmath4 distribution in the resulting simulation be compatible with the observed atmospheric neutrino events . the best agreement between data and simulation",
    "is obtained for @xmath12 ns . hence , this value is used for all simulations in this analysis , in particular for extracting the central value of the allowed range of angular resolutions .",
    "a time resolution of 3.4 ns is found to be incompatible with the neutrino flux model at the 2@xmath13 level , where the uncertainty is taken from @xcite .",
    "this places an upper bound on the time resolution , which translates into a 1 @xmath13 systematic uncertainty on angular resolution of 0.1 degrees .",
    "this uncertainty incorporates , to first order , all effects which have a net result of degrading the time resolution , such as possible mis - alignments and inaccuracies in the simulation of light propagation in the water or the transit time distribution of the pmt . a similar analysis with analogous results",
    "has been performed using downgoing muon data instead of upgoing neutrino candidates .",
    "the absolute orientation of the detector is known with an accuracy of about @xmath14 degrees @xcite ; this uncertainty is taken into account as an independent effect .    , for upgoing events in data ( black points ) which have an error estimate @xmath6 degree .",

    "it can be computed by convoluting @xmath21 with @xmath22 . for declinations",
    "@xmath23 degrees , @xmath20 and @xmath15 are approximately constant . for @xmath24 degrees ,",
    "the functions decrease because of the requirement that the tracks are upgoing . for a source declination of -90 ( 0 ) degrees , @xmath20 = 3.2 ( 1.8 ) @xmath25 .",
    "this means a total of 3.2(1.8 ) neutrinos would be detected and selected from a point source with a flux of @xmath26 .",
    "for this flux model , the energy of 80% of the selected signal is in the range @xmath27 tev .    to constrain the systematic uncertainty on the acceptance ,",
    "the atmospheric neutrino data have been compared to a simulation in which the efficiency of each om is reduced .",
    "the maximal reduction for which data and simulation are still compatible corresponds to a 15% reduction in the acceptance for signal neutrinos with an @xmath7 spectral shape .",

    "two distinct approaches to look for point - like neutrino sources have been used . in the _ full sky search _ , a search is made for an excess of events over the atmospheric neutrino background anywhere in the field of view .",
    "in addition , a _ candidate list search _ is made , where the presence of a signal is tested at the locations of 24 known pre - defined high energy gamma ray sources which could be expected to emit neutrinos .",
    "they include supernova remnants , microquasars and bl lac objects .",
    "while more restrictive in scope , the candidate list search requires less signal to reach a significant excess , compared to the all - sky search .",
    "the addition of the candidate search may therefore be thought of as a way to give extra _ a - priori _ weight to the preselected sources .",
    "the search method is based on the likelihood of observing the events , which is defined as : @xmath28 - \\mu_{\\rm sig }                             - n_{\\rm bg } \\label{eq : lik1}\\ ] ] where the sum is over the neutrino candidate events , and @xmath29 is a parametrization of the point spread function .",

    "the likelihood is maximized for each candidate by numerically fitting the source intensity @xmath35 to the events located within 20 degrees of the source , with the source coordinates fixed to the known position . in the full sky search ,",
