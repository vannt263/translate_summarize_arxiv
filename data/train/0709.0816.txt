    ", feynman derived the sourceless set of maxwell s equations which are galileo invariant .",
    "the interpretation of the feynman s derivation of the maxwell s equations has aroused@xcite a great interest among physicists .",
    "in particular tanimura @xcite has generalized the feynman s derivation in a lorentz covariant form with a scalar time evolution parameter .",
    "an extension of the tanimura s approach has been achieved@xcite in using the hodge duality to derive the two groups of maxwell s equations with a magnetic monopole in a flat and in a curved spaces . in ref .",
    "the descriptions of relativistic and non relativistic particles in an electromagnetic field was studied , whereas in ref .   a dynamical equation for spinning particles was proposed .",
    "a rigorous mathematical interpretation of feynman s derivation connected to the inverse problem for the poisson dynamic has been formulated in ref .  .",
    "also in refs .   and the feynman s derivation is considered in the frame of the helmholtz s inverse problem for the calculus of variations . other works@xcite have provided new looks on the feynman s derivation of the maxwell s equations .",
    "more recently@xcite , some of the authors embedded feynman s derivation of the maxwell s equation in the framework of noncommutative geometry . as feynman",
    "s brackets can be interpreted as a deformation of poisson brackets we showed that the feynman brackets can be viewed as a generalization of the moyal brackets defined over the tangent bundle space@xcite .",
    "the mathematical foundations of feynman s formalism is presented in section [ formalism ] and is used to review the feynman s derivation of the maxwell s equation in section [ maxwell ] .",
    "it is well known that velocities do not commute in the presence of an electromagnetic field .",
    "for this reason the angular algebra symmetry , _",
    "e.g. _ the so(3 ) symmetry in the euclidean case , is broken . in section [ so3 ]",
    "we show how to restore such a symmetry and we point out in this context the necessity of adding the poincar momentum @xmath0 to the simple angular momentum @xmath1 .",
    "the direct consequence of this restoration is then the generation of a dirac magnetic monopole .",
    "a natural extension of feynman s formalism is to consider the dual momentum space . in section [ nqm ]",
    "we embed then our work in the natural generalization of quantum mechanics involving noncommutative coordinates .",
    "this generalization was originally introduced by snyder@xcite as a short distance regularization to improve the problem of infinite self energies inherent in a quantum field theory . due to the advent of the renormalization theory this idea was not very popular until connes@xcite analyzed yang mills theories on noncommutative space . more recently a correspondence between a noncommutative gauge theory and a conventional gauge theory was introduced by seiberg and witten@xcite .",

    "moreover the particle acquires an effective dual mass in the same way that an electron moving in a periodic potential in solid state physics . again the angular algebra symmetry is naturally broken and the restoration of this symmetry gives then a dual dirac monopole in momentum space field configuration .",

    "the commutation of the momentum implies that there is no external magnetic field .",

    "the fact that the field is homogeneous in space is an essential property for the vacuum .",
    "in addition , one easily see that a particle in this field moves freely , that is , the vacuum field does not act on the motion of the particle in the absence of an external potential .",

    "in the case of an harmonic oscillator expressed in terms of the original @xmath84 coordinates the hamiltonian reads @xmath85 from which we have @xmath86 , @xmath87  and the equation of motion @xmath88 which corresponds formally to a particle in a harmonic oscillator submitted to an external constant magnetic field . from equation ( [ theta ] )",
    "we deduce that @xmath89  @xmath90 , so @xmath91 , and the hamiltonian can then be written @xmath92 with @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the dual tensor of the maxwell constraint tensor .",
    "note that the interaction with the field @xmath96 is due to the presence of the position dependent harmonic potential and leads to a dual paramagnetic interaction which could be experimentally observable . like an electron in the effective periodic potential of ions",

    "consequently we have @xmath111 which is the dual of the famous poincar momentum introduced in positions space @xcite .",
    "then the generalized angular momentum @xmath112 is a genuine angular momentum satisfying the usual algebra .",
    "it is the summation of the angular momentum of the particle and of the dual monopole field .",
    "one can check that it is a conserved quantity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the use of this formalism with these coordinates had been made also for massless particles in the context of anyons @xcite .",
    "the duality between the monopole in momentum space and the dirac monopole is due to the symmetry of the commutation relations in noncommutative quantum mechanics where @xmath30 = i\\hbar q_{\\theta } \\varepsilon ^{ijk}\\theta _ { k}(\\mathbf{p})$ ] and the usual quantum mechanics in a magnetic field where @xmath113 = i\\hbar q\\varepsilon ^{ijk}b_{k } ( \\mathbf{x})$ ] .",
