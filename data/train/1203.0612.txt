    "in the minkowski background , the classical stability of a vacuum of a scalar field is guaranteed if its mass squared ( ie the curvature of the potential ) is positive .",
    "however , this does not imply the quantum stability of the vacuum .",
    "it may be metastable depending on the global shape of the potential .",
    "if the vacuum is a local minimum but not a global minimum of the potential , it may decay into a stabler state via the bubble nucleation due to quantum tunneling  @xcite .",
    "this situation remains essentially the same even if we take gravity into account  @xcite .    in an ads background ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "indeed , it is known that an ads vacuum may be classically stable even if the mass squared is negative , provided that it is at or above the bf bound  @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the curvature radius of the ads spacetime and @xmath2 is the spacetime dimension .",
    "of course , as in the case of the minkowski spacetime , this does not guarantee the quantum stability of the system .",
    "however , in contrast to the minkowski case , one can not judge the stability of a tachyonic vacuum just by looking at the global shape of the potential .",
    "in fact , the system is perfectly stable even for an unbounded potential such as an inverted quadratic potential provided that the mass squared satisfies the bf stability bound .",
    "so , the question is how to judge the stability of a vacuum .    to this end",
    ", we mention that there exists an algebraic criterion for the global stability of an ads vacuum .",
    "it was proved that if the potential takes the form , @xmath3 then any non - trivial field configuration has a positive definite energy  @xcite .",
    "hence , the system is stable .",
    "in other words , considering ( [ super ] ) as a first - order nonlinear differential equation for @xmath4 for a given potential @xmath5 , the existence of a real solution for @xmath4 guarantees the absolute stability of the system .",
    "this is a sufficient condition for the stability ( the stability condition is further refined recently in @xcite ) . even for this sufficient condition , knowing the explicit form of a potential does not help us much to know the stability since it involves solving the nonlinear differential equation .",
    "given this situation , we take another strategy .",
    "namely , we consider instability conditions instead of stability conditions . it is known that if there exists an instanton in the system , then it is quantum mechanically unstable",
    ". thus we look for instanton solutions . specifically , we look for a class of potentials which admit exact analytical instanton solutions .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no one has found instantons representing the decay of a tachyonic vacuum ( except for instantons with unconventional boundary conditions  @xcite which are not related to the vacuum decay ) .",
    "this means no one has found a potential which is classically stable but quantum mechanically unstable .    in this paper , extending the method developed in @xcite , we look for exact instantons for a class of potentials which satisfies the bf stability bound .",
    "the class of potentials contain two parameters ; one of them controls the value of the mass squared and the other the global shape of the potential .",
    "we compute everything analytically .",
    "in particular , the bounce action is analytically computed and found to be positive and finite .",
    "thus we find a class of tachyonic vacua which are classically stable but quantum mechanically unstable .",
    "interestingly , our method automatically excludes the existence of instanton solutions for a potential with mass squared below the bf bound . since the vacuum for such a potential is already classically unstable , this result seems reasonable , though we should not perhaps claim it as a general theorem at the moment because we have not proved the complete generality of our method yet .    in order to understand better the reason behind the quantum mechanical instability , we calculate various quantities as functions of the model parameters . comparing the algebraic criterion with our findings",
    ", we discuss stability criteria for tachyonic vacua in ads spacetime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formulate instanton solutions in an asymptotically ads spacetime . in section iii",
    ", we shows that instantons exist only for the potential with the mass squared above the bf bound . in section iv , we find exact instanton solutions , which represent the instability of the tachyonic state at or above the bf bound .",
    "the final section is devoted to discussion and conclusion .",
    "we consider the @xmath2-dimensional euclidean action for a scalar field @xmath6 coupled with gravity : @xmath7\\ , , \\label{basicaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the ricci scalar of the metric @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the determinant of the induced metric on the boundary , and @xmath12 is the trace part of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the second term is necessary to make the variational principle consistent when the spacetime is non - compact , called the gibbons - hawking boundary term  @xcite .    here",
    "we note that the critical case @xmath13 needs special care . in this case , one has two different theories depending on the choice of the asymptotic boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "one may stick to the original action  ( [ basicaction ] ) .",
    "but in this case it is known that the theory is unstable  @xcite .",
    "so to discuss the quantum instability , we consider the theory with an additional boundary term , @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes a unit normal vector of the boundary @xmath16 .",
    "it is known that adding this boundary term makes the system perturbatively stable  @xcite . in subsequent sections we consider",
    "this theory when the mass squared saturates the bf bound .",
    "assuming @xmath17-symmetry , we consider the metric of the form , @xmath18 and the scalar @xmath19 . under the @xmath17-symmetry",

    "\\label{hc1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now construct an exact instanton solution in the presence of gravity by extending the method developed in @xcite .",
    "namely , instead of giving the form of the potential first , we consider the condition on the form of the scale factor for the existence of a regular instanton solution and look for a function describing the scale factor that enables us to derive the potential as a function of the scalar field analytically .",
    "since we are interested in the decay of an ads vacuum , instantons are required to be asymptotically ads . for a pure ads spacetime with the curvature radius @xmath1 , we have @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) where @xmath30 corresponds to spatial infinity and @xmath31 to the origin .",
    "thus for an asymptotically ads spacetime , we set the scale factor in the form , @xmath32 where the function @xmath33 is assumed to be regular at @xmath29 , and @xmath1 is the ads curvature radius in the asymptotic region .",
    "since the function @xmath34 describes deformation from ads spacetime , we call @xmath34 the deformation function .",
    "the above form of the scale factor guarantees the asymptotic ads nature of the metric . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath35 by @xmath36 . in terms of @xmath35",

    "thus , if we specify the function @xmath43 in these equations , both of @xmath47 and @xmath5 are given as a function of @xmath35 . integrating the expression for @xmath47 one",
