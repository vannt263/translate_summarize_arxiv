    "more than 35 years ago , a correlation between the 10@xmath0 m mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) and 1.4ghz luminosities in galactic nuclei was first noticed by @xcite . in 1983",
    ", the launch of the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ brought a new era in collecting large samples of data in the infrared , and sparked numerous studies investigating the above mentioned correlation in star forming galaxies .",
    "both the radio and infrared emission are closely related to star formation activities .",
    "the radio continuum is known to originate from two processes : thermal free - free emission from ionized gas in hii regions and non - thermal synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons that are accelerated in the supernovae remnants ( snrs ) ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the thermal emission usually has a rather flat spectrum with f@xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 while the non - thermal component often has a much steeper spectral slope with f@xmath3@xmath4@xmath6 . in normal galaxies",
    "the relative contribution of the two components varies with frequency and at 1.4ghz the radio continuum is dominated ( at nearly @xmath790% ) by the non - thermal component .",
    "the infrared emission is due to the thermal re - radiation of starlight from dust surrounding hii regions @xcite .",
    "based mostly on _ iras _ data , it has been shown that the far - infrared ( fir , 40 - 120@xmath0 m ) to radio correlation holds well over a remarkably wide range of star forming galaxies , spanning several orders of magnitude in luminosities @xcite .",
    "the availability of deep observations of distant galaxies by the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ and recently by _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite showed that the correlation between the ir and radio emission is not limited to the local universe but also extends in galaxies at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "it was also revealed that in addition to the fir , the mid - ir emission at @xmath724@xmath0 m correlates with the 20 cm radio continuum , though with more scatter @xcite .",
    "a number of very deep _ spitzer _ mid - ir and fir surveys can now probe a population of galaxies with low infrared luminosities for which ancillary data , including deep radio imaging , are becoming available ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is particularly interesting since in the near future @xmath8 m is the longest wavelength which will likely be probed by the james web space telescope .",
    "it is thus instructive to examine the mid - ir to radio correlation in more detail in these low luminosity nearby systems , for which little is known to date .",
    "as ubiquitous as the fir / radio correlation appears to be , there are a few significant deviations from it .",
    "radio excess exists in some instances , such as galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "external magnetic field compression due to the interaction with nearby galaxies could also produce extra emission in the radio continuum @xcite .",
    "conversely , synchrotron deficiency has been found in some nascent starburst galaxies studied by @xcite which was attributed to the lack of time for massive young stars to evolve into supernovae ( sn ) since these galaxies are just at the onset of a starburst episode . on the other hand , in the infrared",
    ", dust emission can be damped in an optically - thin environment , because the ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical light may not be fully reprocessed by the dust , as seen in low luminosity dwarf galaxies .",
    "blue compact dwarf galaxies are a group of extra - galactic objects that are characterized by their blue optical colors , small sizes ( @xmath91kpc ) and low luminosities ( m@xmath10 - 18 ) .",
    "these galaxies do not display any agn signature@xmath1114.3/24.3@xmath0 m are detected ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . ] and have recent bursts of star formation in a relatively unevolved chemical environment . as such",
    "they have been proposed as nearby analogs of star formation in young galaxies in the early universe . in a metal poor environment ,",
    "star forming regions are usually optically thin and emit less in the infrared .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that in a low luminosity galaxy , the radio emission also decreases , and probably faster than the infrared .",
    "the deficiency in both the non - thermal radio and fir emission may counterbalance each other and result in a similar fir / radio ratio to the one observed in normal spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "this was examined by a study of star formation rates ( sfrs ) in bcds performed by @xcite , in which the authors found an excellent agreement between the sfrs estimated from 1.4ghz and 60@xmath0 m luminosities .",
    "as @xcite has pointed out though , the fir / radio correlation is almost linear , not because the ir and radio emission reflect the sfrs correctly , but because in low luminosity galaxies they are both underestimated by similar factors .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite , who found from their modelling work in disk galaxies that the transparency of the disk was about the same to both re - emission processes .",
    "@xcite in their analysis of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of low metallicity bcds , noticed that these systems do not follow several of the usual correlations between the mid - ir , fir and radio emission and display a scatter of a factor of @xmath710 .",
    "the _ spitzer _ space telescope has enabled us to study the infrared properties of a large sample of bcds , probing the lower end of the luminosity and metallicity range . in this paper ,",
    "the fifth in a series @xcite , we examine their mid - ir and fir to radio correlation extending the work of @xcite . we describe the sample selection and the observational data in  2 . a detailed study of mid - ir and fir / radio correlation , as well as its dependence with other parameters , such as metallicity and dust temperature",
    "are presented in  3 .",
    "we also discuss two extreme cases , izw18 and sbs0335 - 052 in  3 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  4 .",
    "as part of the irs @xcite guaranteed time observation ( gto ) program ( pid : 85 ) , we have compiled a sample of bcd candidates ( @xmath764 ) selected from the second byurakan survey ( sbs ) , bootes void galaxies @xcite , and other commonly studied bcds .",
    "these sources are known to have low metallicities ranging from 0.03z@xmath12 to 0.5z@xmath12 .",
    "their 22@xmath0 m fluxes have been published in @xcite .",
    "we also include 10 galaxies from @xcite ( pid : 59 ) , which are mostly bcds and starburst galaxies , and span a larger metallicity range ( 0.03z@xmath12@xmath71.5z@xmath12)m fluxes by doing a color correction to the _ iras _",
    "25@xmath0 m fluxes because of the aperture difference between these two band filters . ] . for all galaxies with 22(24)@xmath0 m detections , we searched the literature as well as the public archives ( nvss and first ) for 1.4ghz radio continuum data .",
    "we restirct our sample to sources with both mid - ir and radio detections which results in a sample of 23 galaxies .",
    "finally , we also include 5 galaxies that have 22@xmath0 m detections and 1.4ghz upper limits published by hopkins et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for comparison between ours and hopkins samples .",
    "note that the sample was not selected based on infrared properties , but merely on bcd - type objects and the availability of both infrared and radio data . as a result ,",
    "our sample is not complete , but the large number of sources that only became detectable in the infrared with _ spitzer _ , allows us to probe the properties of low luminosity dwarf galaxies , and provide statistically meaningful results .",
    "the observational information for this sample and previously published data are presented in table [ tab1 ] , which includes the positions of the sources , their mid - ir , fir and 1.4ghz flux densities , as well as oxygen abundances of the ionized gas .",
    "all sources in this study have mid - ir flux measurements either at 22@xmath0 m with the irs red peak - up camera and/or at 24@xmath0 m with mips @xcite .",
    "the photometric fluxes of these two bands differ by less than 10% for galaxies in the local universe .",
    "this was confirmed by using a suite of @xmath7100 spectra of nearby galaxies from our irs / gto database and calculating their synthetic 22 and 24@xmath0 m fluxes after convolving the spectra with the corresponding filter response curves . for consistency , in our analysis",
    "we use the mips 24@xmath0 m measurements , and the 22@xmath0 m values are only used when the 24@xmath0 m values are not available . for sources above the irs 22@xmath0 m and mips 24@xmath0 m saturation limits we use the irs low resolution spectrum to estimate a synthetic 24@xmath0 m flux .",
    "we also obtained far - infrared fluxes for our sample from the archival _ iras _ 60 and 100@xmath0 m data @xcite .",
    "most of the 1.4ghz radio continuum data are from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) @xcite , while one is from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm ( first ) @xcite , along with some individual observations ( references in table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "a total of seven sources were too faint and were not included in the nvss catalogue .",
    "for those we used the values of @xcite who studied a similar bcd sample and remeasured the 1.4ghz fluxes using the images from nvss and first , providing radio detections for 2 sources and better upper limits for another five sources that overlaps with the galaxies in our sample .",

    "these two competing factors , dust and radio emission , counter balance each other ( see * ? ? ?",
    "bcds though , are typically small , less than @xmath71kpc in size , and have fewer hii regions with massive stars ( w.r.t . normal galaxies ) which heat the dust and go supernovae to produce cosmic rays . as a result the averaging effects in the sampling of the properties of the interstellar medium which result from the limited spatial resolution in dense galactic disks is not so prominent in bcds .",
    "furthermore , the small number of statistics may also contribute to the observed higher dispersion in q@xmath1 ratios in metal - poor dwarf galaxies .",
    "we investigate how metallicity affects the q@xmath1 ratios by dividing the dwarf galaxies in our sample into two groups : a lower metallicity group with 12+log(o / h)@xmath98.0 and a higher metallicity group with 12+log(o / h)@xmath158.0 .",
    "this metallicity threshold was selected following @xcite who noticed a change in the properties of the star - forming dwarf galaxies they studied around this metallicity value .",
    "we find a mean q@xmath421.1@xmath200.1 for the first group and q@xmath39 1.3@xmath200.1 for the second one .",
    "if we calculate the q@xmath1 for the low metallicity group without including sbs0335 - 052e , we find a much lower q@xmath39 0.9@xmath200.1 .",
    "we also notice that it appears q@xmath1 generally decreases with reduced metallicity for sources with 12+log(o / h)@xmath138.0 , with sbs035 - 052e as a clear outlier , and the slope flattens out at 12+log(o / h)@xmath158.0 ( see fig .",
    "this scatter in q@xmath1 at higher metallicities could be attributed to the more dispersion in the mid - ir emission in these sources and is consistent with a number of other studies that have found increased dispersion in the q ratios for very high luminosity galaxies ( which usually have higher metallicities ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite have found evidence that , for a given galaxy , there is a small decrease in f(100@xmath0m)/s(20 cm ) when the dust temperature increases .",
    "the latter can be traced by the ratio of f(60@xmath0m)/f(100@xmath0 m ) .",
    "@xcite reached a similar result for the starburst galaxies they studied , in which they detected an anti - correlation of q@xmath2 with f(60@xmath0m)/f(100@xmath0 m ) .",
    "however , performing the same test for the q@xmath1 ratios on our dwarf galaxy sample which spans a range of flux ratios -0.4 @xmath13log ( f(60@xmath0m)/f(100@xmath0m))@xmath130.2 we find no such clear trend .",
    "it is conceivable that this is partly because our sample is too small to identify a trend due to the intrinsic scatter in q@xmath1 .",
    "both the radio and infrared emission can be used to estimate the star formation rates ( sfrs ) in galaxies . however , these correlations depend on a number of parameters including dust content , optical depth and metallicity .",
    "this topic and potential caveats have been discussed extensively in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . for dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the topic has been addressed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the recent wealth of data from _",
    "spitzer _ has also provided sufficient motivation to establish a calibration for the sfr using the infrared . @xcite and",
    "more recently @xcite have explored this topic using a large sample of star forming regions and nearby galaxies .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot the ir estimated sfr for our sample using the calibrations proposed by @xcite and @xcite respectively : @xmath43    @xmath44^{0.885}\\ ] ]    as a function of the well - known radio to sfr formula of @xcite :    @xmath45    the @xcite work is based on a global correlation without separating the low metallicity sources from metal rich galaxies . as can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , a good agreement exists between the radio and ir estimated sfrs ( indicated by diamonds ) . if we use the more recent calibration by @xcite on sfrs from 24@xmath0 m luminosities , we find that most of the mid - ir estimated sfrs ( marked as filled circles ) are located below the 1:1 proportionality line , and thus they are consistently lower than both the sfrs estimated from the radio or from @xcite .",
    "this is not unexpected since eq",
    ". 2 is calibrated based on the high metallicity sources that have significant 24@xmath0 m emission , while most of our sources are metal - poor galaxies .",
    "we should also note that @xcite measure the sfr in individual hii regions in apertures within disks and subtract a `` disk background '' , which could partly explain the deviations we see from our analysis .",
    "these authors have also mentioned that the sfrs of low metallicity galaxies would be underestimated by a factor of 24 depending on how metal - poor the galaxies are .",
    "this deviation from a linear correlation is likely due to the lower opacities for decreasing metal content @xcite .",
    "when we fit the filled circles on fig .",
    "4 , we find that log(sfr[ir])=0.94@xmath17log(sfr[1.4ghz]/3.98 ) , which is consistent with the metallicity correction factor suggested by @xcite .",
    "we should stress once more though that as @xcite has noted , the good agreement between the ir and radio estimates of sfrs does not necessarily mean that these are the `` true '' sfrs for the dwarf galaxies we study , but rather the competition of the lower dust content and suppressed synchrotron emission balances each other .      despite this overall agreement between the ir / radio correlation in our dwarf sample and the corresponding values of normal galaxies , the two lowest metallicity galaxies in our sample , izw18 and sbs0335 - 052e , deviate markedly from the correlations and in opposite directions ( see fig .",

    "a number of plausible scenarios were considered to explain this result , though none appears convincing . as discussed in @xcite , because the optical depth of izw18 is small , it could be that a significant fraction of the uv light has leaked out without being absorbed by the dust , thus resulting in a damped 24@xmath0 m emission .",
