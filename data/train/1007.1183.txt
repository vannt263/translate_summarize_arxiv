    "higher dimensional black holes have played an important role in understanding basic properties of fundamental theories , such as string theory .",
    "a number of interesting solutions of higher dimensional black holes have been discovered recently  @xcite , revealing much richer structure of their solution space than that of four - dimensional black holes , and we are naturally led to address the question of how to classify them .",
    "there have already appeared several papers that generalize the black hole uniqueness theorems  @xcite to higher dimensions  @xcite , upon some additional assumptions concerning the horizon topology , symmetry properties , asymptotic structures , etc . in particular ,",
    "five - dimensional generalizations of the uniqueness theorems have been shown , in various theories , for stationary , axisymmetric ( with two rotational symmetries ) black holes being non - compact , as a simple higher dimensional generalizations of the well - known four - dimensional setup . however , since our real , observable world is macroscopically four - dimensional , extra - dimensions have to be compactified in realistic , classical spacetime models  .",
    "therefore it is of great interest to consider higher dimensional kaluza - klein black holes , which look like four - dimensional , at least at large distances .",
    "classifying such kaluza - klein solutions may also help us to get some insights into the major open problem of how to compactify and stabilize extra - dimensions in string theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address such a classification problem , showing a uniqueness theorem for stationary kaluza - klein black hole solutions of five - dimensional minimal supergravity .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of kaluza - klein black holes is a black - string , a direct product of a four - dimensional vacuum black hole and a circle . a more non - trivial class of kaluza - klein black holes is given by",
    "_ squashed _ kaluza - klein black holes , found recently by ishihara - matsuno  @xcite , applying the squashing technique to five - dimensional black holes .",
    "the idea is that for , e.g. , the simplest static vacuum case , one first views the @xmath0 section ( or horizon manifold ) of a five - dimensional schwarzschild - type black hole spacetime as a fibre bundle of @xmath2 over @xmath3 , and then considers a deformation that changes the ratio of the radii of the fibre @xmath2 and base @xmath3 , so that the resultant spacetime looks , at large distances , like a twisted @xmath2 over a four - dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime , hence a kaluza - klein spacetime , while it looks like a five - dimensional black hole near the event horizon .",
    "the basic structure of squashed kaluza - klein black holes can in fact be seen in the much earlier works of refs .",
    "@xcite , whose solutions asymptote to a twisted @xmath2-bundle over a four - dimensional spacetime as studied in  @xcite .",
    "a number of further generalizations of squashed kaluza - klein black holes has been made lately  @xcite .",
    "the recent accumulation of this new type of kaluza - klein black hole solutions also motivates us to address the classification problem of kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "all known exact kaluza - klein black hole solutions in five - dimensions admit the isometry group that describes the stationarity and two ` axial ' symmetries , one along @xmath3 base space and the other along @xmath2 fibre , or simply @xmath4 .",
    "these symmetries are mutually commuting , hypersurface orthogonal , and form the isometry group @xmath5 . in this paper , we consider kaluza - klein black holes that possess this symmetry property and that are purely bosonic as solutions to the minimal supergravity .",
    "the topology of horizon cross - sections can be either @xmath0 , @xmath6 , or lens space @xmath7 is not allowed under the assumption of null energy condition . ] .",
    "more precisely we shall show the following :    * theorem .",
    "* _ consider the bosonic sector in five - dimensional minimal supergravity , i.e. , in five - dimensional einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theory with a certain special value of the chern - simons coupling constant [ given by eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) below ] , a stationary charged rotating black hole with finite temperature that is regular on and outside the event horizon and asymptotically kaluza - klein spacetime [ the precise definition is given below ] .",
    "assume that the black hole spacetime admits , besides the stationary killing vector field , two mutually commuting axial killing vector fields so that the isometry group is @xmath8 and that the topology of the horizon spatial cross - sections is either @xmath0 , or @xmath9 , or @xmath10",
    ". then ( i ) if there exists no nut in the domain of outer communication , the black hole spacetime with @xmath0 , or @xmath9 horizon cross - section is uniquely characterized by its mass , and two independent angular momenta , electric charge , nut charge and magnetic flux , and ( ii ) if the topology of the black hole exterior region is @xmath11 , the black hole spacetime with @xmath1 horizon cross - section is uniquely characterized by its dipole charge and rod structure in addition to their charges and magnetic flux . _",
    "it is known that the bosonic sector of minimal supergravity that possess the above symmetry group can be reduced to a non - linear sigma model  @xcite , which is much more complicated than the well - known four - dimensional electrovacuum case .",
    "nevertheless , one can derive formulas similar to those used in the four - dimensional uniqueness proof , such as the coset matrix representation of the equations of motion , the divergence ( mazur ) identity , etc .",
    ",  @xcite , as we will discuss below .",
    "apart from the difference in the sigma - model , another main difference from the four - dimensional case can be seen in the boundary value analysis , in particular , along the symmetry axis and the horizon .",
    "this is because we have a larger variety of the horizon topology in five - dimensions .",
    "we can specify the horizon topology in terms of the ` rod - structure ' ( or interval structure )  @xcite .    the new part of the job that is particular for our asymptotic kaluza - klein case is in the boundary value analysis at infinity .",
    "we need to consider fall - off conditions of the sigma - model fields at infinity more carefully than the globally flat case . when inspecting the asymptotic fall - off behavior of the perturbations , we find that the perturbations of the metric and the gauge field decouple each other at least in the leading order .",
    "then , imposing boundary conditions for the asymptotically kaluza - klein spacetime , we will identify the parameters which are used to characterize the solutions .",
    "for example , from the leading order of the fall - off behavior of the gravitational sector , we find @xmath12 which describes how much the @xmath2-fibre ( i.e. , the compactified @xmath13th - dimension ) is twisted with respect to the @xmath3 base space , and @xmath14 which may be viewed as the ` angular ' momentum along @xmath13th - dimension , in addition to the usual angular momentum @xmath15 along @xmath16 of the base space . from the maxwell part",
    ", we have , besides the electric charge @xmath17 , the magnetic flux @xmath18 over the base space at infinity , and furthermore the dipole charge @xmath19 if the topology of the horizon cross section is @xmath1 ( see the next section for their precise definitions . ) .",
    "the main interest of this paper is in the context of minimal supergravity , and we therefore restrict our attention to the einstein - maxwell - chern - simons ( emcs ) theory with a certain value of the coupling constant .",
    "however , one can expect that a similar uniqueness theorem may also hold in other similar theories .",
    "for example , restricting attention to some integrable sector of the five - dimensional pure einstein - maxwell theory , a uniqueness theorem similar to the above has recently been shown  @xcite , based on the classification of kaluza - klein black holes in arbitrary , @xmath20-dimensional , vacuum einstein gravity  @xcite with @xmath21 killing symmetries .",
    "the sigma - model for the integrable sector of five - dimensional pure einstein - maxwell system appears quite different , but the basic strategy for the proof is essentially the same as the one we will consider below .",
    "however , we should note that the integrable sector considered in  @xcite corresponds to a highly restricted class of the solutions in which the electric part of the maxwell field and , at least , one of the two angular momentum are required to vanish .",
    "for this reason , the boundary value analysis in the asymptotic region ( i.e. , at large distances ) in  @xcite seems rather simple and straightforward .",
    "furthermore , for the solutions dealt with in  @xcite , some of the parameters in our above theorem turn out to be identically zero .",
    "in this paper we consider more ( perhaps the most ) general class of kaluza - klein black hole solutions with a single horizon of the minimal supergravity that possess the above isometry group , so that the solutions can admit two independent arbitrary ` angular ' momenta ( one of which may be called the momentum along the compactified dimension ) and non - vanishing electric component of the maxwell field .",
    "we find that for such a general solution , for example , the parameter @xmath18 appears , in contrast to the case of asymptotically flat cases  @xcite for which @xmath18 vanishes .",
    "note also that for some known exact solutions  @xcite , the parameter @xmath18 seems to be related to so - called gdel parameter , whose square is proportional to the energy density of magnetic field .",
    "as well known  @xcite , the five - dimensional gdel type universe is filled with the pressureless magnetic field and due to the rapid rotation of the magnetic field , the spacetime admits closed timelike curves in far regions , but for kaluza - klein black holes  @xcite it exhibits no causal pathology outside the event horizon , thanks to the appropriate compactification .",
    "as far as we know , the most general solution with all independent parameters has not yet been found .",
    "hence , we would like to show that the such a solution is characterized by their parameters and therefore must be unique _ if it exists_.    in the next section , we will briefly describe our strategy for the proof and write down some necessary formulas , such as the equations of motion , the definitions of relevant sigma - model fields . in section  [ sec :",
    "infinity ] , by solving straightforwardly emcs equations near infinity , we derive the kaluza - klein asymptotics the asymptotic behaviors of the metric and gauge potential of maxwell - chern - simons field-in the weyl - papapetrou coordinate system . in section  [ sec : bh ] we perform the boundary value analysis for black holes with a spherical horizon topology and complete our proof . in section [ sec : br ] we consider the boundary value analysis for black rings with @xmath1 horizon cross section and show the uniqueness theorem . in section [ sec : bl ]",
    "we also discuss the boundary value analysis for black lenses . in section [ sec : summary ]",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "first we briefly describe the basic strategy for our uniqueness proof , which roughly proceeds as follows .",
    "( i ) we first reduce the ( bosonic sector of ) five - dimensional minimal supergravity theory with three commuting independent killing symmetries to a non - linear sigma model , that is , set of equations for eight scalar fields @xmath22 on two - dimensional orbits space @xmath23 , with the target space isometry @xmath24 . with the aid of @xmath24",
    ", the action of the sigma model can be described in terms of a symmetric , unimodular matrix , @xmath25 , on the coset space @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an isotropy subgroup of @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the solutions of the original system can be expressed by the matrix @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the matrix @xmath25 formally defines a conserved current , @xmath15 , for the solution .",
    "( ii ) next , we introduce the _ deviation matrix _ , @xmath28 , which is essentially the difference between two coset matrices , say @xmath29}$ ] and @xmath30}$ ] , so that when two solutions coincide with each other , the deviation matrix vanishes , and vice versa . what we wish to show",
    "is that @xmath28 vanishes over the entire @xmath23 when two solutions satisfy the same boundary conditions that specify relevant physical parameters characterizing the black hole solution of interest . for this purpose ,",
    "we construct a global identity , called the _",
    "mazur identity _ , ( the integral version of ) which equates an integration along the boundary @xmath31 of a derivative of the trace of @xmath28 to an integration over the whole base space @xmath23 of the trace of ` square ' of the deviation , @xmath32 , of the two conserved currents , @xmath33}$ ] and @xmath34}$ ] .",
    "the latter is therefore non - negative .",
    "( iii ) then , we perform boundary value analysis of the matrix @xmath28 . we identify boundary conditions for @xmath25 that define physical parameters characterizing black hole solutions and that guarantee the regularity of the solutions . then we examine the behavior of @xmath28 near @xmath31 . for higher dimensional case ,",
    "this is the point where the topology and symmetry properties , translated into the language of the rod - structure , come to play a role as additional parameters to specify solutions .",
    "also this is the place where we have to take into consideration the nature of asymptotic structure of the spacetime .",
    "when the integral along the boundary @xmath31 , say the left - side of the mazur identity , vanishes under our boundary conditions , it then follows from the right - side of the identity , i.e. , the non - negative integration over @xmath23 , that @xmath32 has to vanish , hence the two currents , @xmath33}$ ] and @xmath34}$ ] , must coincide with each other over @xmath23 , implying that the deviation matrix @xmath28 must be constant over @xmath23 . then",
    ", if @xmath28 is shown to be zero on some part of the boundary @xmath31 , it follows that @xmath28 must be identically zero over the entire @xmath23 , thus proving the two solutions , @xmath29}$ ] and @xmath30}$ ] , must be identical .    in our present case ,",
    "the first two steps ( i)-(ii ) completely parallel those in paper @xcite , and step ( iii ) is the new result of this paper . in the following",
    "we provide some of the formulas for steps ( i ) and ( ii ) , such as the definitions of the relevant sigma - model fields , in order to establish our notation .",
    "the reader can also find them in paper  @xcite .",
    "some relevant formulas , such as the coset matrix representation of the sigma - model field , are also summarized in the appendix .",
    "we start with the five - dimensional minimal supergravity action @xmath36 \\ , ,   \\label{action } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we set a newton constant to be unity and @xmath37 . varying this action ( [ action ] ) , we derive the einstein equation @xmath38 and the maxwell equation @xmath39 which have the extra term coming from the chern - simons term of ( [ action ] ) . we are concerned with asymptotically kaluza - klein , stationary , charged rotating black hole solutions of this theory .",
    "we additionally impose two independent axial symmetries , so that the total isometry group is @xmath40 with @xmath41 being stationary symmetry , generated by mutually commuting three killing vector fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 . using the einstein equations and the maxwell equations , we can show that the generators @xmath44 of the isometry group satisfy type of integrability conditions discussed in ref .",

    "see e.g. , @xcite . furthermore , by using the maxwell s equation and einstein s equations , we introduce the magnetic potential @xmath58 and twist potentials @xmath59 by @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "then , the nonlinear sigma - model reduced from the theory ( [ action ] ) with the symmetry assumptions consists of the target space with the isometry @xmath62 and the eight scalar fields @xmath63 on the base space @xmath23 .",
    "all the other fields such as @xmath64 , etc can be determined by @xmath22 through the equations of motion .",

    "<S> more precisely , under the assumptions of the existence of two commuting axial isometries and a non - degenerate connected event horizon of the cross section topology @xmath0 , or lens space , we prove that a stationary charged rotating kaluza - klein black hole in five - dimensional minimal supergravity is uniquely characterized by its mass , two independent angular momenta , electric charge , magnetic flux and nut charge , provided that there does not exist any nuts in the domain of outer communication . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that under the assumptions of the same symmetry , same asymptotics and the horizon cross section of @xmath1 , a black ring within the same theory  if exists  </S>",
    "<S> is uniquely determined by its dipole charge and rod structure besides the charges and magnetic flux . </S>"
