    "in recent years there has been an enormous increase in the number of proteins that can be isolated , due to the rapid advances in biotechnology .",
    "however , the determination of the function of these proteins has been slowed by the difficulty of determining their crystal structure by standard x - ray crystallography .",
    "a major problem is that it is difficult to grow good quality protein crystals .",
    "experiments have clearly shown that this crystallization depends sensitively on the physical factors of the initial solution of proteins .",
    "an important observation was made by george and wilson @xcite , who showed that x - ray quality globular protein crystals only result when the second virial coefficient , @xmath0 , of the osmotic pressure of the protein in solution lies within a narrow range .",
    "this corresponds to a rather narrow temperature window . for large positive @xmath0",
    ", crystallization does not occur on observable time scales , whereas for large negative @xmath0 , amorphous precipitation occurs .",
    "rosenbaum , zamora and zukoski then showed @xcite that crystallization of globular proteins could be explained as arising from attractive interactions whose range is small compared with the molecule s diameter ( corresponding to the narrow window of @xmath0 ) . in this case",
    "the gas - fluid coexistence curve is in a metastable region below the liquidus - solidus coexistence lines , terminating in a metastable critical point .    when a system undergoes a phase transition the change in the gibbs free energy @xmath1 consists of two terms - an enthalpy change @xmath2 and and an entropy change @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "the change in the gibbs free energy must be negative in order for the transition to occur .",
    "the enthalpy change is negative because in the separated state the more dense phase has a larger number of contacts and therefore its contact energy is lower .",
    "however , the dense state has a lower entropy and its entropy change is also negative .",
    "these two terms compete and at low temperatures the free energy change due to particles going from the dilute phase to the dense phase is negative and phase separation occurs .",
    "however , above some temperature the entropy loss exceeds the enthalpy loss , so that the change in the gibbs free energy is positive and phase separation does not occur .",
    "the solvent can change this picture dramatically @xcite . consider the free energy change of the particle going from the dilute phase to the dense phase . @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the enthalpy change of the particle between the dense and dilute phases , @xmath7 is the entropy of the solute particle change , @xmath8 is the enthalpy change of the solvent and @xmath9 is the entropy change of the solvent .",
    "the first two terms on the right side of ( [ energychangeseparation ] ) behave exactly as described above .",
    "the last two terms , however can be either negative or positive .",
    "as an example of this , consider water .",
    "water has a large number of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the bulk state .",
    "when one adds a hydrophobic particle to water , some of these bonds break .",
    "this leads to an increase in the entropy of water and to a decrease in its enthalpy .",
    "however , the further rearrangement of the water molecules around the solute particle leads to even stronger bonds , thereby decreasing solvent entropy and decreasing the solvent enthalpy .",
    "when particles aggregate the water molecules return to the original bulk state so the entropy and the enthalpy of the water increase to their original values@xcite .",
    "this is an example how the @xmath9 and the @xmath8 terms in ( [ energychangeseparation ] ) can be positive .",
    "if the sign of the total enthalpy and the total entropy change is positive , then decreasing temperature can lead to the opposite behavior , when the system tends to be separated above some temperature and uniform below .",
    "this leads to a lower critical point .",
    "this phenomenon has been experimentally observed in different systems @xcite .",
    "the most interesting example of a lower critical point in context of our work is the phase diagram of sickle hemoglobin , which is thought to have an upside down fluid fluid coexistence curve @xcite , as inferred from the observation of an upside down spinodal curve .",
    "below the lower critical point the water molecules build strong hydrogen bonds around solute particles preventing them from aggregating .",
    "as one increases the temperature the free energy decrease of the aggregating particles surpasses the free energy gain of the water and the system phase separates .",
    "if one increases the temperature further , the total entropy loss due to aggregation becomes larger than the total enthalpy loss , so the phase separation becomes less favorable again and above some upper critical temperature the system becomes uniform .",
    "thus for the hydrophobic particles one can have both an upper and a lower critical point ; in other words , the fluid - fluid phase diagram has the form of a _ closed loop_. this can be the case for different protein - water solutions .",
    "in this paper we present a simple model for the role of the solvent .",
    "we model the multicomponent protein - solvent system as a binary system in which the solute molecule is much bigger than the solvent .",
    "we assume that the role of other components in the system are subsumed in the effective solute - solute interaction .",
    "the role of a salt , for example , is assumed simply to screen the charge on the proteins , inducing the effective inter particle attraction , whose strength is controlled by the salt concentration .",
    "this assumption permits us to predict three qualitatively different effects of the role of the solvent for globular proteins in solution , all of which are consistent with experimental observation @xcite .",
    "the first is a negative enthalpy and entropy of crystallization , which gives a normal liquid - solid line .",
    "lysozyme is an example of this , as it has a negative enthalpy of crystallization , of the order of minus 75 @xmath10 .",
    "the second is a positive enthalpy of crystallization , which gives the upside down ( retrograde ) behavior of coexistence curves .",
    "this has been seen in hemoglobin c ( co - hbc ) , which has a high positive enthalpy of 155 @xmath10 of crystallization .",
    "this system exhibits a strong retrograde solubility dependence on temperature ( figure [ fig_hbcsolubility ] ) .",
    "another example of retrograde behavior is chymotrypsinogen a @xcite .",
    "the third is a zero enthalpy of crystallization , which gives vertical coexistence curves .",
    "apoferritin has an enthalpy of crystallization close to zero and has a solubility which is independent of temperature ( vertical behavior in the temperature - solubility diagram ) .",
    "details of the fitting procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the figure was nicely granted by p. g. vekilov .",
    ", width=377 ]    we consider a situation in which the solute particle - particle interactions are described by a repulsive hard core together with an attractive interaction .",
    "for example , the interparticle potential might be described by the dlvo potential @xcite , which consists of a debye - h@xmath11ckel interaction and a van der waals interaction .",
    "other model potentials are the square well and modified lennard - jones models that have been used successfully in recent years to describe globular proteins in solution .",
    "if the attractive part is short - ranged then these effective potentials can qualitatively describe the canonical phase diagram of the globular protein solution .",
    "we can therefore consider that solvent contribution was accounted in these effective potentials and there is no need to add the solvent - solute interactions into potential .",
    "examples of proteins that have canonical phase diagram are lysozyme @xcite and @xmath12-crystallin @xcite .",
    "however for proteins that have completely different phase diagram ( like apoferritin or hbs , hbc ) these effective potentials fail to describe the phase diagram even qualitatively . in this case",
    "the solvent contribution was nt successfully included into effective potential .",
    "the model presented in this paper is an attempt to account for the solvent effect to describe the phase diagrams of the proteins like apoferritin , hbs , hbc at least qualitatively .",
    "we then include a simplified solute - solvent interaction to the solute - solute interaction , which is similar to one used recently to describe hydrophobic interactions @xcite .",
    "our particular interest is globular proteins in solution , but our treatment in principle includes other systems .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a description of our model , while section 3 contains a discussion of the particular case of a square well system with solvent . for this particular choice of solute - solute interaction , we are able to obtain the phase diagram of the square - well potential model * with * solvent contribution from the phase diagram of the square - well potential * without * solvent contribution .",
    "section 4 discusses three cases of this mapping , for different choices of parameter values , that yield upper critical points , lower critical points , and closed loops , respectively .",
    "section 5 contains a derivation of a modified clausius - clapeyron equation in the presence of the solvent , that takes into account the temperature dependence of the effective interaction potential .",
    "section 6 contains the results of a simulation of a modified lennard - jones model plus solvent .",
    "the modified lennard - jones model was originally introduced to describe the phase diagram and nucleation rates for globular proteins in solution @xcite .",
    "we show that for a particular choice of parameter values the solvent produces a fluid - fluid coexistence curve with a lower critical point .",
    "the liquid - solid coexistence lines for this model are also shown .",
    "finally , section 7 contains a brief conclusion .",
    "in this section we will derive a phenomenological model that describes the influence of the solvent on a system of interacting protein particles . consider a system of protein particles interacting via a short ranged pairwise potential @xmath13 .",
    "the total energy of such a system is @xmath14 where the subscript @xmath15 denotes the potential energy in the absence of the solvent .",
    "the corresponding helmholtz free energy @xmath16 of the system is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of particles in a volume v , @xmath19 is the thermal de broglie wavelength , @xmath20 the coordinates of the particles and @xmath21 is a boltzman constant . to take into account the effect of the solvent on this system",
    ", we note that a particular solvent molecule can be either in the bulk or in a `` shell '' region around a protein particle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_mlg ] ) .",
    "we define the energy and entropy ( in units of @xmath21 ) differences between these two states to be @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "in general these quantities depend on the temperature @xcite , i.e. @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "thus the free energy difference between a solvent molecule in the bulk and in the shell is @xmath26 .",
    "the total energy of the protein - water system therefore is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of water molecules around the @xmath29 particle .",
    "we now assume that this number is proportional to the available area on the protein molecule surface and approximate this area as proportional to the maximum possible number of contacts of the protein molecule with other protein molecules .",
    "that is , the available energy is proportional to @xmath30 minus the actual number of contacts @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 we absorb the proportionality coefficient into @xmath33 and @xmath23 .",
    "next , define two particles to be in contact when the distance between their centers of mass is less than some value @xmath34 and greater than @xmath35 , where @xmath35 is the hard core diameter .",
    "define the function @xmath36 to be equal to one if the distance between particles @xmath37 and @xmath38 is less than @xmath34 , but greater than @xmath35 and is zero otherwise .",
    "if the distance between the particles is less than their hard core diameter , the total energy of the system is infinite , which is the value of @xmath39 , so one can define @xmath40 at that distance .",
    "the number of contacts for the @xmath29 particle is then given by @xmath41 combining equations ( [ total_energy ] ) , ( [ water_contacts ] ) and ( [ protein_contacts ] ) , we find that the total energy of the system is @xmath42 we can combine the first and the last terms on the right hand side and define a modified intermolecular interaction parameter @xmath43    in summary , our model assumes that a water molecule can be either in the bulk or close to the protein particle ( shell ) ; the number of water molecules near the particle is proportional to the available area on the surface of the particle ; the available area on the protein surface is proportional to the maximum possible number of protein - protein contacts minus the actual number of contacts .",
    "in order to simplify this expression for the energy , we consider a system with a repulsive hard core and an attractive square - well ( sw ) potential , whose range of attraction is @xmath44 .",
    "we can write @xmath45 in the form of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the well depth .",
    "the total energy of such a system is @xmath48 the first term on the right hand side is just the energy of the square - well potential with the well depth @xmath49 .",
    "this simplification allows us to map the phase diagram of this square - well potential model * with * solvent contribution onto the phase diagram of the square - well potential * without * solvent contribution .",
    "denote the free energy of the square - well system with well depth @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of ( [ total_energysw ] ) does not depend on the position of the particles .",
    "therefore the free energy of the sw system * with * solvent @xmath52 the free energy density of the system is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the free energy density of the square - well system ( without solvent ) .",
    "denote @xmath55 and @xmath56 as the chemical potential and grand canonical free energy density respectively . in this case @xmath57 and @xmath58 . to obtain the phase diagram for the square - well system one needs to solve the phase coexistence conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "suppose that we have obtained this phase diagram in some way ( numerically , for example ) .",
    "the square - well coexistence curve has the following functional form @xmath61    to obtain the phase diagram of a square well system * with * the solvent we should write the chemical potential and grand canonical free energy in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 . @xmath62 as we can see the phase diagram for the protein solvent system maps to the square well phase diagram with the well depth @xmath63 : @xmath64 assuming that @xmath33 and @xmath23 do not depend on temperature , the relationship between the phase diagrams for these two models is given by @xmath65    in summary , we are able to obtain the phase diagram for an interacting protein system that includes the effect of solvent in terms of the interacting protein system without solvent , assuming that the protein - water attractive interactions are given by a square well potential ; that the range of the protein - water interaction is equal to the range of the protein - protein interaction @xmath66 and that the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath23 are constants .",
    "in this section we consider examples of the phase diagram mapping for the square well model with solvent .",
    "let @xmath67 in ( [ coeqistence ] ) be a fluid - fluid coexistence curve .",
    "the critical point can be determined by the following condition @xmath68 if we define the left hand side of ( [ coexistence1 ] ) as @xmath69 then @xmath70 this means that the critical density of the modified system is the same as the critical density of the original square well system .",
    "the second derivative shows whether there is an upper or lower critical point . taking into account that @xmath71 at the critical point , we obtain @xmath72 the original square well model has an upper critical point , so @xmath73",
    ". therefore the sign of the denominator determines the type of the critical point .",
    "if @xmath74 then there is an upper critical point .    in our simplified model with constant @xmath33 and @xmath75 we can calculate @xmath76 explicitly @xmath77 .",
    "this gives the first condition for upper or lower critical points .",

    "one of the possible fluid - fluid coexistence curves is a closed loop @xcite with both upper and lower critical points . in order to obtain this behavior from our model",
    "we must have temperature dependent @xmath33 and @xmath23 .",
    "we use the four level muller , lee , and graziano ( mlg ) model of water @xcite to obtain @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in this model water molecules",
    "can be either in disordered ( broken hydrogen bonds ) or ordered states .",
    "when the protein particles are added , each state of a water molecule splits into shell and bulk states .",
    "thus we have a four level model ( fig . [ fig_mlg ] ) .",

    "moelbert and de los rios @xcite considered a lattice model using the four level approximation and found by monte carlo simulation a fluid - fluid coexistence line in the form of a closed loop        using the above values of energies and degeneracies we can calculate the energy levels of the shell and bulk states : @xmath90 in the same way we determine the values of the entropies for the bulk and shell states : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the parameters of our model @xmath33 and @xmath23 are the differences of the energies and entropies in the bulk and shell states respectively , @xmath94 substituting ( [ energy_diff ] ) and ( [ entropy_diff ] ) into ( [ coexistence1 ] ) we can numerically map the square well phase diagram onto the mlj - model phase diagram . figure [ fig_loopmapping ] shows the dependence of the left hand side of ( [ coexistence1 ] ) versus the temperature of the system ( mapping curve ) in the presence of solvent for three different values of the protein - protein interaction strength . the horizontal line in fig .",

    "the horizontal dashed line shows the critical temperature of the original square well system ( without solvent ) .",
    "all curves intersects  the critical temperature of the system without solvent twice .",
    "this means that the mlg system in these cases has two critical points - one is the lower critical point ( the slope of the curve is negative ) , the other is the upper critical point ( the slope of the curve is positive ) .",

    "this permits us to determine the upper and lower critical points . in the low temperature limit @xmath97 and in the high temperature limit : @xmath98 one necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition to have both upper and lower critical points is ( [ low_kt ] ) to satisfy conditions ( [ lower_conditions ] ) and ( [ high_kt ] ) to satisfy ( [ upper_conditions ] ) .",

    "so far we have considered a special case in which the range of the solute - solute interaction is equal to the that of the shell region . in general",
    "this is not the case . in this section",
    "we develop an approximate mapping for such systems .",

    "the terms inside the brackets on the right hand side of ( [ brilliantovrelationship ] ) are explained in @xcite .",
    "this mean - field approximation has different precision for different interactions and even for the same interaction with different parameters .",
    "division of the potential into the repulsive and attractive parts adds more freedom to obtaining parameter @xmath102 ( [ interactionintegral ] ) , equal to zero for @xmath105 less than hard core diameter @xcite ] which also reduce quantitative precision .",
    "the assumption made in this section is that the critical density is the same for the systems with and without solvent .",
    "this is approximately true for @xmath106 , where the critical density is about 0.4 . for higher values of @xmath99",
    "this assumption fails .",
    "the analysis given in this section therefore can provide only qualitative understanding of the behavior of the critical temperature for different @xmath100 .",
    "what is important is that the right hand side of ( [ brilliantovrelationship ] ) depends only on the isothermal compressibility and its derivatives with respect to density of the hard sphere system @xcite .",

    "the main difference is that the relationship ( [ coexistence2 ] ) is for all temperatures , while the ( [ brilliantovmappingcritical2 ] ) is only for the critical point .",

    "so we approximately change the system with solvent and @xmath119 by the system with solvent and effective parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath118 .",
    "this allows us to perform a mapping of the sw system phase diagram onto the effective system with solvent phase diagram using ( [ brilliantovmappingcritical ] ) .",
    "we can consider the latter as the qualitative behavior of the system of interest .",
    "now we consider a liquid - solid coexistence in the presence of the solvent . to determine the solid - liquid coexistence curve we use gibbs - duhem integration proposed by kofke @xcite .",

    "a rearrangement of the solute particles leads to a rearrangement of solvent particles .",
    "the entropy of the system consists of two parts : the entropy of the protein particles and the entropy of the solvent molecules . since in our model",
    "we do nt consider separate solvent molecules , but rather just average their contribution , the effective interaction ( [ modified_energy ] ) has the temperature dependent term due to having integrated out the solvent degrees of freedom .",

    "while the difference between the solid and the liquid of the entropy is generally negative ( the solid state is more ordered ) , the total solvent plus solute entropy difference can be positive .",

    "[ fig_mapping ] ) corresponding to the temperature @xmath157 are also the coexistent densities of the system with solvent at a temperature @xmath160 .",
    "now choose another temperature @xmath161 , invert it , using the mapping curve , to @xmath162 and use densities @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mapping ] ) as the coexistent densities at @xmath162 for the system with solvent . by continuing this process",
    "we obtain the phase diagram for the system with solvent ( figure [ fig_phasediagramsolvent1 ] ) .",
    "as one can see , this has a lower critical point and in general an upside down coexistence curve as compared with fig .",
    "[ fig_canonicalswphasediagram ] .",
    "the interesting feature of this phase diagram is that at a temperature equal to @xmath165 the effective depth of the square well becomes zero and the particles behave as hard spheres , with the corresponding coexistent densities equal to the hard spheres case . in the figure [ fig_phasediagramsolvent1 ] @xmath166 .     and",

    "x denotes liquid - solidus line ; + denotes fluid - fluid coexistence.,width=453 ]    the next step is to invert the mapping curves shown in the figure [ fig_loopmapping ] . for this purpose",
    "we have to solve numerically equation ( [ coexistence1 ] ) with parameters given by ( [ energy_shell ] ) - ( [ entropy_bulk ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig_closedloopsall ] shows three fluid - fluid coexistence curves corresponding to the three mapping curves shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_loopmapping ] .",
    "one can see that indeed the phase diagrams have the form of closed loops .",
    "this is because each temperature @xmath151 of the system without solvent corresponds to two temperatures @xmath160 and @xmath162 for the system with solvent .",
    "this can be understood from consideration of the mlg energy level model ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mlg ] ) . at low temperatures",
    "the solvent molecules mostly occupy the lowest level , corresponding to the ordered shell .",
    "this state corresponds to the uniform distribution of the solute particles surrounded by the structures of solvent molecules . at high temperatures",
    "the solvent molecules mostly occupy the top energy level , which corresponds to the disordered shell .",
    "so the system again tends to be in the uniform state , but now the solvent surrounding the solute particles is disordered . at intermediate temperature",
    "the system tends to occupy the bulk energy levels , which favors the phase separation .",
    "this is the property of the mlg model that reflects the picture described in the introduction .    .",
    "the choice of solvent parameters is determined by equations ( [ energy_shell ] ) - ( [ entropy_diff ] ) .",
    "the case with @xmath168 qualitatively corresponds to the situation described in @xcite where two proteins interact as hard spheres ( on lattice).,width=453 ]    the mapping curves shown in the figure [ fig_loopmapping ] produce the closed loop like fluid - fluid coexistence curves .",
    "figure [ fig_closedloopwhole ] shows the behavior of the liquid - solid line in this case .",
    "the liquid - solid line also displays a behavior similar to the fluid fluid coexistence line .",
    "we are unaware of any experimental observations of such a liquid - solid coexistence behavior and do not know whether it is simply an artifact of our particular model .     for the choice of parameters determined by equations ( [ energy_shell ] ) - ( [ entropy_diff]).,width=453 ]      in this section consider the effect of solvent on particles interacting via a modified lennard - jones ( mlj ) potential given by    @xmath169^{6 } }                     -                     \\frac{\\alpha}{[(r/\\sigma)^{2}-1]^{3}})&\\mbox{$r\\ge\\sigma$}.                     \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    [ eq_mlj ] it has been shown that at the critical point the nucleation rate is many orders of magnitude greater than at other points in the phase diagram .",
    "this suggests that the nucleation of protein particles can be achieved near the critical point .",
    "the model has been well studied and its critical point accurately determined .",
    "for the case of the mlj model , we again choose to use a solvent - solute interaction range , @xmath170 , that is equal to the protein - protein particle interaction range .",
    "because the particles interacting via this potential have an effective hard - core diameter , care must be taken such that we choose an appropriate value for @xmath170 .",
    "we calculate the effective hard - core diameter using    @xmath171,\\ ] ]    where @xmath172 is the repulsive part of the potential .",
    "the range over which the particles interact is controlled by the parameter @xmath173 in [ eq_mlj ] .",
    "we choose @xmath174 as in other studies .",
    "it has been shown that for @xmath175 , one can obtain an equivalent range in terms of @xmath99 , the parameter denoting the range in the square well system .",
    "we use the value @xmath176 . to account for the effects of the effective hard - core diameter",
    ", we actually use @xmath177 for the solvent - solute interaction range .",
    "the values @xmath178 and @xmath179 were used as before to obtain an upside - down phase diagram .    to calculate the solid - fluid phase boundaries , we use a modified gibbs - duhem equation given by eq . 43 .",
    "a coexistence point was calculated using free - energy methods and simulations of a coupled einstein lattice .",
    "isobaric - isothermal ( npt ) simulations were performed in parallel for @xmath180 particles on a periodic simulation cell to obtain the entire coexistence curve .",
    "equilibration and production times were five million and ten million monte carlo steps , respectively .",
    "we calculated the fluid - fluid coexistence curve using the gibbs ensemble monte carlo method .",
    "two physically separated , but thermodynamically connected , simulation cells are allowed to exchange particles and undergo volume displacements such that the total number of particles @xmath181 and total volume @xmath182 remain constant .",
    "simulations were performed on an @xmath183 particle system .",
    "equilibration and production runs were fifty million and one hundred million monte carlo steps , respectively .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ fig_solvent ] .    as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "the phase diagram for this model with the particular parameters used is very similar to that for the square well model shown in figure [ fig_phasediagramsolvent1 ] .",
    "the model presented in this paper takes into account the solvent contribution to the solute - solvent free energy of globular proteins in solution .",
    "the contribution depends on the parameters that describe the free energy of the solvent molecule change , @xmath33 and @xmath23 .",
    "these parameters play the role of the solvent enthalpy and entropy change per solvent particle as the molecule goes from the bulk to the vicinity of the protein molecule .",
    "the solvent enthalpy and entropy change per solute particle upon changing from the fluid phase to the solid phase(parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 from ( [ energychangeseparation ] ) ) can be calculated as equal to @xmath33 and @xmath23 times the difference of the average number of contacts per molecule in these two phases .",
    "these relationships allow us to relate @xmath33 and @xmath75 to the three cases of the solubility dependence described in the introduction - normal solubility dependence , retrograde solubility dependence and constant solubility ( as in the case of apoferritin ) .",
    "all we need is the sign of the total enthalpy change @xmath2 . for the square well case , @xmath185 is a condition for @xmath2 being negative and therefore the solubility curve being normal .",
    "if the range of attraction is short this qualitatively describes the lysozyme phase diagram .",
    "the condition @xmath186 is a condition for @xmath187 being positive and therefore the solubility curve being retrograde .",
    "this corresponds to the case of the hbc solubility curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig_hbcsolubility ] ) .",
    "indeed we can see that the liquidus line in the figure [ fig_phasediagramsolvent1 ] has qualitatively the same behavior as the hbc solubility curve . if @xmath188 , so that the enthalpy change is small , then the solubility curve is almost vertical , with the sign of the slope determined by the sign of the enthalpy change .",
    "the advantage of this simplified model is that in the particular case of the square well , with the particle - particle range of interaction equal to the width of the shell region around the particle , one can obtain the phase diagram by a mapping of the square well phase diagram without solvent .",
    "therefore one does nt have to perform monte carlo simulations or theoretical approximations to obtain the phase diagram for the model with solvent .",
    "the exact mapping is also possible for the hard sphere model with solvent . in this case",
    "the hard sphere case is interesting in two aspects .",
    "first , one can obtain an exact mapping procedure for any solvent - solute interaction .",
    "second , the hard sphere interaction does nt include any initial solvent contribution ( unlike the case with an effective solute - solute interaction ) .",
    "this can be the case of noninteracting neutral colloidal particles in the solvent .",
    "if we put such particles into water , the hydrogen bonds break and rearrange , as explained in the introduction and in @xcite . therefore we can use the mlg model to get solvent parameters @xmath33 and @xmath23 .",
    "we can consider the hard sphere interaction to be a square well with @xmath168 and @xmath190 . then using a mapping curve as in the figure [ fig_loopmapping ] ( the one with @xmath168 )",
    "we can obtain the phase diagram of the neutral , noninteracting spherical particles in water . if the critical temperature of the square well system with a range of interaction equal to @xmath100 intersects the mapping curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig_loopmapping ] ) , the colloidal system has a closed loop type phase diagram ( fig [ fig_closedloopsall ] with @xmath168 ) . as the value of @xmath100 decreases ( the size of the particle increases ) , the fluid - fluid coexistence curve shrinks and disappears .",
    "so larger noninteracting particles do nt have a fluid - fluid phase separation in this model .",
    "however , if the particles starts to interact , the mapping curve lowers ( fig [ fig_loopmapping ] ) and phase separation may occur again .    for the case of constant solvent parameters we can have either an upper critical point with a normal solubility dependence , or a lower critical point with a retrograde solubility dependence .",
    "the temperature dependent parameters allow us to have a combination of these behaviors .",
    "a natural way to derive the temperature dependent solvent parameters for water is to use the mlg model .",
    "this model , together with our solvent - solute interaction , has closed loop phase diagrams , similar to @xcite .",
