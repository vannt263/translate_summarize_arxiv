    "the _ precision cosmology _ is often mentioned in present day cosmology in the sense that the model parameters are constrained with a few percent precision level @xcite .",
    "the future projects for cosmological observations also forecast the sub - percent level parameter estimation in the optimistic situation ( e.g. , see @xcite for euclid project ) . however , most of considerations for the observational precision rely on the concordance cosmology based on the @xmath1cdm model with the cosmological constant @xmath1 as the dark energy , the cold dark matter ( cdm ) as the dominant dark matter , and the initial density and gravitational wave power spectra provided by the inflation era in the early universe . for the @xmath1 , the effect of dark energy on the evolution of universe at",
    "the early epoch is negligible or small . even in the dynamical dark energy models ,",
    "attentions have been paid on the late - time behavior of the dark energy that starts to dominate the matter component only at very recent epoch , @xmath2 .    as soon as we introduce a dynamical dark energy ,",
    "its prehistory could become important @xcite , and it is certainly allowed that the dark energy may dominate at some earlier epoch without violating observational constraints , but with differing cosmological parameter estimations . in order to demonstrate such possibilities of alternative cosmological parameter estimations in einstein s gravity , here",
    "we would like to investigate one such a model based on a known dark energy model proposed in the literature as an example . by introducing an early dark energy ( ede ) which becomes ephemerally dominant in the early cosmological era",
    ", we will show that there exists room for alternative cosmological parameter estimation based on the same cosmological observations .",
    "a simple _ fluid _ model of ede is known in the literature which accommodates the scaling behavior of dark energy so that the dark energy density parameter is constant before the onset of the late - time acceleration @xcite .",
    "observational constraints on the fluid - based ede model were given by several groups using the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) , type ia supernovae ( snia ) , lyman-@xmath3 forest , and hubble constant data @xcite .",
    "the recent constraint on the ede density parameter from the planck observation is @xmath4 ( 95% confidence limit ) @xcite .",
    "there are also studies on the transient acceleration models where the universe might be decelerated in the near future @xcite .    here",
    ", we consider an early episodically ( or ephemerally ) dominating dark energy model based on the scalar field which transiently becomes important in the radiation- or early matter - dominated era before the onset of the late - time acceleration .",
    "our aim is to investigate the observational effects and the consequent cosmological parameter estimations based on the observationally indistinguishable altered dark energy models .",
    "our field theory based model can accommodate the purely scaling behavior of dark energy component and is free from the ambiguity seen in the fluid - based ede model . for the latter model ,",
    "the behavior of the dark energy perturbation variables strongly depends on the definition of sound speed and the method of dealing with the dynamical property of the dark energy clustering .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : ede ] describes the scalar - field - based ede model adopted here .",
    "we present the numerical calculations of background evolution of the ede model and provide the empirical method of obtaining the initial conditions of the scalar field variables . in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs_eff ] , we show how matter and cmb power spectra are affected by the presence of ede , and constrain the conventional cosmological parameters for selected ede models using the recent cosmological observations . the summary and conclusion are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . throughout this paper , we set @xmath5 .",
    "to mimic the episodic behavior of dark energy we consider a minimally coupled scalar field with the potential @xmath6 e^{-\\lambda \\phi }            + v_1 e^{-\\beta \\phi}. \\label{eq : v}\\ ] ] the first term is known as the albrecht - skordis potential with two interesting points @xcite : ( i ) it allows the _ near _ scaling evolution where the energy density of the scalar field scales with the dominant fluid density during the evolution , and ( ii ) it drives the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "it is known that both the permanent ( @xmath7 ) and the ephemeral ( @xmath8 ) accelerations are possible depending on a choice of parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the previous studies on the transient nature of dark energy with the albrecht - skordis potential were mainly focused on its recent transient behaviors @xcite . on the other hand , here we consider a different case in which the transient dark energy domination occurs before the onset of the late - time acceleration that will be driven by the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) ( see @xcite for a similar work ) . for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath11 throughout this work .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath12 behaves as the cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig : bg_example ] shows an example of evolution of our ede model , where an extremely shallow local minimum was set by choosing @xmath13 , @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is related to the initial dark energy density parameter as @xmath16 during the radiation - dominated era and has been chosen to satisfy the big bang nucleosynthesis bound ( @xmath17 ) @xcite . in this case",
    "the scalar field starts to roll down the potential with scaling behavior , gets slower until it arrives at the local minimum , and then suddenly kicks and rolls rapidly down the potential out of the minimum .",
    "the rolling becomes slower as time goes by , and the dark energy acquires the scaling nature again because the field rolls down the potential which is effectively similar to the exponential one .",
    "we consider a special case with a large value of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ; gray curves ) , which shows the effective scaling behavior without the episodic dark energy domination .",
    "hereafter , we refer to such a model as the scaling dark energy ( sde ) model .",
    "we evolve a system of multiple components for radiation , matter , and a minimally coupled scalar field without direct mutual interactions among the components .",
    "our convention and the basic equations are summarized in refs .",
    "a set of initial conditions for the scalar field has been obtained with an empirical method to give the scaling behavior of dark energy . from the scaling evolution of the scalar field",
    ", we have energy density and pressure as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy density of the dominant fluid with equation - of - state parameter @xmath22 .",
    "combining the time - derivatives of @xmath23 and @xmath24 with the equation of motion for scalar field gives a relation @xmath25 where a prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "next , at the initial epoch @xmath27 we choose a trial initial value of @xmath28 within a sufficiently wide interval of @xmath29 , and obtain the initial condition for @xmath30 using the above relation . from the scaling evolution of dark energy ,",
    "we impose a condition that the second derivative @xmath31 should vanish at the initial stage ( numerically @xmath32 ; see the constant nature of @xmath33 for sde model ; fig .",
    "[ fig : bg_example ] , top - right panel ) . by changing the value of @xmath28 using the bisection iteration technique",
    "we obtain very accurate initial conditions for @xmath34 and @xmath33 within trials of about 30 times . for each background evolution with these initial conditions ,",
    "the value of @xmath12 has been adjusted to satisfy the condition @xmath35 at the present epoch , where @xmath36 is the hubble parameter . during setting these initial conditions",
    ", we simply set @xmath37 . in the appendix",
    ", we present the initial conditions of background scalar field variables ( @xmath28 , @xmath30 ) together with the potential parameters of ede ( sde ) models considered in this paper .    for the scalar field perturbation variables , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we have adopted the scaling initial conditions for the pure exponential potential case @xcite , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the growing - mode solution of density perturbation variable for the dominant @xmath22-fluid .",
    "these initial conditions are valid to use because the background evolution of our ede model shows very accurate scaling evolution in the early era .",
    "although these are not the exact initial conditions , the actual evolution of perturbation variables shows a scaling behavior quite well .",
    "figure [ fig : pert_example ] shows evolution of density perturbations of baryon ( @xmath42 ) and scalar - field dark energy ( @xmath43 ) in the cdm - comoving gauge , together with that of scalar field perturbation variables ( @xmath38 , @xmath44 ) at two different comoving scales ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) for the ede model ( @xmath14 , @xmath13 , @xmath15 ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : bg_example ] . note that the evolution of baryon density perturbations ( red dotted ) slows down during the episodic domination of dark energy ( around @xmath47 ) , compared with the cases of @xmath0 ( black solid ) and sde models ( gray dotted curves ; fig .",
    "[ fig : pert_example ] left panels ) , and that the amplitude of dark energy perturbations becomes quite weaker during the recent epoch when the late - time acceleration is driven by the cosmological constant .",
    "in order to see observational signatures of our scalar - field based ede model , we consider both the scalar- and tensor - type perturbations in a system of multiple components for radiation , matter , and a minimally coupled scalar field without direct mutual interactions among the components . for this purpose , we modified the publicly available camb and cosmomc packages @xcite by including the evolution of background and perturbation of the scalar field quantities .",
    "figure [ fig : bgpert_examples ] shows the evolution of background densities and dark energy equation of state , baryonic matter density power spectrum , and cmb temperature and polarization power spectra in the ede model with some chosen values of @xmath48 . here the strength of the ephemeral domination has been fixed to @xmath49 by adjusting the potential parameter @xmath9 . for smaller @xmath48 the epoch of the ephemeral domination occurs earlier .",
    "we note that the dark energy component shows scaling behavior during the radiation and matter dominated era except for the transient domination period and that episodically dominating dark energy strongly affects the evolution of perturbations .",
    "figure [ fig : bgpert_examples ] implies that for the same episodic strength the ede domination has weak observational effects if it occurs before the radiation - matter equality ( the cases of @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , the ede domination near ( or after ) that epoch induces significant deviations from @xmath0 model prediction .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath19 which corresponds to ede domination near radiation - matter equality , we observe highly oscillatory features at small angular scales in the cmb temperature anisotropy and the strong deviation from @xmath0 model at all angular scales in the polarization power spectra .",
    "though the effects are much weaker , the same is true in the case of @xmath52 .",
    "compared with the cmb anisotropy , however , the matter power spectrum is less sensitive to the presence of episodic domination of dark energy .    in the next two subsections ,",
    "we explore the parameter constraints of the conventional cosmological parameters in the presence of episodic domination of dark energy using the recent cmb data together with other external data sets .",
    "first , we probe the overall ranges of potential parameters that are favored by cmb and large - scale structure data .",
    "figure [ fig : prob_example ] shows probability distributions of the scalar field potential parameters obtained with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 7-year data @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 luminous red galaxies ( sdss dr7 lrg ) power spectrum @xcite . here only the potential parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath9 , have been probed in a gridded space while other cosmological parameters are fixed with the fiducial @xmath0 best - fit values ( see table 14 of @xcite ) .",
    "the relative logarithmic probability is defined as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the minimum chi - square determined within the area probed .",
    "it is shown that the epoch and strength of dark energy domination are controlled by @xmath48 and @xmath9 : the smaller @xmath48 ( @xmath9 ) gives the earlier ( stronger ) dark energy domination .",
    "the presence of ede has a major effect on the cmb anisotropy after the radiation - dominated era ( @xmath55 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the matter density perturbation is generally less sensitive to the ede , being affected by only the strong ede domination near the radiation - matter equality ( @xmath56@xmath57 ) .",
    "therefore , as noted earlier , the parameter constraint are not much improved by adding the galaxy power spectrum . in this example",
    ", we directly use the galaxy power spectrum measured from the sdss data . during the model constraining , we have effectively excluded the galaxy power spectrum information at scales @xmath58 where the nonlinear clustering dominates . the effect of bias parameter of galaxy clustering relative to the underlying dark matter distribution is taken into account by marginalizing over the overall amplitude of the galaxy power spectrum ( see sec .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "we have not used the snia data because it is sensitive only to the late - time acceleration of the universe and does not affect the behavior of our ede models with a limited range of @xmath59 . in this example",
    ", the potential parameters with the larger value of @xmath48 and the smaller value of @xmath9 seem to be disfavored by the observational data .",
    "however , we will see later that such potential parameters ( denoted as triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob_example ] as an example ) can be favored by the current observations if different values of conventional cosmological parameters are chosen .",
