    "optical excitation of graphene can result in the interband population inversion and negative real part of the dynamic conductivity of a graphene layer @xmath1 in the thz range of frequencies  @xcite .",
    "the negativity of the real part of the dynamic conductivity implies that the interband emission of photons with the energy @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the reduced planck constant , prevail over the inraband ( drude ) absorption . if the thz photon losses in the resonant cavity are sufficiently small , the thz lasing can be realized in graphene - based devices with optical pumping  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the optically pumped thz lasers with a fabri - perot resonator were considered . in this paper , we propose and evaluate the thz lasers based on multiple - graphene - layer ( mgl ) structures with a metal slot - line waveguide ( slw ) or a dielectric waveguide ( dw ) pumped by optical radiation .",
    "the specific features of characteristics of the mgl - based lasers under consideration are associated with the frequency dependences of the absorption in the waveguides and the gain - overlap factor , which is sensitive to the spatial distribution of the thz electric field .",
    "as show in the following , the characteristics of the lasers with slw and dw are fairly similar , so that we will mainly focus on the device with slw . this in part because the structures with slw exhibit somewhat better confinement and can be used not only for mgl - based lasers with optical pumping but also in mgl - based injection lasers with lateral p - i - n junctions ( both electrically induced  @xcite and formed by pertinent doping of mgl structure ) .",
    "we consider lasers with an mgl structure on a sic or si substrate with the side highly conducting metal strips and a highly conducting back electrode at the substrate bottom or on the top of a dw .",
    "the cross - sections ( corresponding to the @xmath4 plane ) , of the device structures under consideration are schematically shown in fig .  1 . the axis @xmath5 correponds to the direction of the electromagnetic wave propagation , whereas the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions are in the mgl structure plane and perpendicular to it , respectively ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the mgl plane corresponds to @xmath8 .",
    "the finiteness of the mgl structure thickness can be disregarded .",
    "it is assumed that the mgl structure under consideration comprises @xmath9 upper gls and a highly conducting bottom gl on a sic substrate or @xmath9 gls ( without the bottom gl ) on a si substrate .",
    "epitaxial mgl structures with up to @xmath10 gls with very long momentum relaxation time of electrons and holes ( @xmath11  ps ) were recently fabricated using the thermal decomposition from 4h - sic substrate  @xcite .",
    "mgl structures without the bottom gl can be fabricated using chemical / mechanical reactions and transferred substrate techniques which include chemically etching the substrate and the highly conducting bottom gl  @xcite ( or mechanically peeling the upper gls ) and transferring the upper portion of the mgl structure on a si or equivalent transparent substrate .",
    "since the electron density and fermi energy @xmath12 in the bottom gl is rather large ( @xmath13  mev  @xcite ) , the drude absorption in this gl can be significant although it can be overcome by a strong emission from the upper gls if their number is sufficiently large .",
    "the mgl structures without the bottom gl can exhibit significant advantages ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and below ) .",
    "it is assumed that the mgl structure is illuminated from the top by light with the energy of photons @xmath14 .",
    "the optical waveguide input of the pumping radiation is also possible .",
    "when @xmath14 is close to @xmath15 , where @xmath16  ev is the optical phonon energy and @xmath17 is an integer , the photogeneration of electrons and holes and their cooling associated with the cascade emission of optical phonons , result in an essentially occupation ( population inversion ) of low energy states near the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band . at elevated electron and hole densities ( i.e. , at sufficiently strong optical pumping ) , the electron and hole distributions in the range of energies @xmath18 in the @xmath19th gl ( @xmath20 ) can be described by the fermi functions with the quasi - fermi energies @xmath21 .",
    "the quasi - fermi energies in the gls with @xmath22 are mainly determined by the electron ( hole ) density in this layer @xmath23 , i.e , @xmath24 and , therefore , by the rate of photogeneration @xmath25 by the optical radiation at the @xmath19th gl plane .",

    "the latter is different from the situation in the mgl lasers with the fabri - perot resonator  @xcite in which eliminating the bottom gl can lead to a pronounced decrease in @xmath78 .",
    "this is attributed to the effect of slw : the variation of the frequency results in a redistribution of the spatial distribution of the thz electric field and , hence , in a change in the gain - overlap factor . due to this , the spacing between the mgl structure @xmath71 and the back electrode affects the the frequency dependences of the thz gain .",

    "this can primarily be explained by the effect of the spatial distribution of the thz electric field on the gain - overlap factor [ compare figs .",
