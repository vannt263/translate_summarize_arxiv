    "understanding how crystalline solids form from fluid phases is a problem that both poses significant intellectual challenges and is a basic input for materials science @xcite .",
    "the standard picture implies that nanoscopic nuclei of the solid are formed due to spontaneous thermal fluctuations when the fluid density has a value exceeding the fluid density at fluid - solid coexistence . due to the cost in surface excess free energy caused by the crystal - fluid interface @xcite , a free energy barrier in phase space needs to be overcome in every event of this so - called homogeneous nucleation @xcite process . in the present paper",
    ", we are neither concerned with the further crystal growth processes @xcite that follow after the crystal nuclei have been formed , nor shall we consider the fact that in practice heterogeneous nucleation @xcite may dominate ( since the free energy barrier may be significantly reduced for nuclei attached to the walls of the container , or to seed particles @xcite , etc . ) .    due to the large value of the nucleation barrier ( which in typical cases is several ten s of the thermal energy @xmath0 @xcite ) and the nanoscopic size of these nuclei ( typically they contain only a few hundred particles @xcite )",
    "nucleation events are rare and difficult to observe directly ( either in experiment or in simulation ) . also the detailed properties of the nuclei that are formed are non - universal and depend upon the particular system under study .",
    "experiments often infer the nucleation rate indirectly from later stages of the process , when the phase transformation from fluid to solid reaches completion @xcite .",
    "of course , this procedure inevitably involves questionable assumptions .",
    "simulations of nucleation kinetics , however , often are feasible only under conditions where the barrier is only of order 10@xmath0 or less @xcite . then it is inevitable that the nuclei are extremely small and strongly fluctuating objects , for which the `` classical '' description in terms of a competition between bulk and surface free energies @xcite fails @xcite",
    ".    many of the difficulties alluded to above are already encountered when one considers nucleation of fluid droplets from a supersaturated vapor @xcite .",
    "however , for nucleation of crystals from melts there occur three additional complications ( i ) the interface tension @xmath1 between a crystal surface and the fluid depends on the orientation of the unit vector @xmath2 normal to the surface relative to the axes of the crystal lattice @xcite .",
    "the shape of the nucleus then is not a spherical droplet as in the case of vapor to liquid nucleation , but also exhibits anisotropy . for strong enough anisotropy , facetted nanocrystals",
    "are expected @xcite . in general , the equilibrium crystal shape is nontrivial and can only be obtained from @xmath3 via the wulff construction @xcite .",
    "( ii ) also kinetic processes , such as attachment of particles to the surface of a nanocrystal , may depend on the surface orientation @xcite .",
    "if the nucleation barrier is not very high , and nucleation plus growth proceed relatively fast , crystal shapes rather different from the equilibrium shape could result @xcite .",
    "( iii ) often , a fluid at the melting / crystallization transition is rather dense , and enhancing the density further a glass transition is encountered @xcite .",
    "then the variation of the kinetic prefactor in the nucleation rate with density becomes an important factor @xcite .",
    "far from the equilibrium coexistence conditions a separation of a static boltzmann factor involving the nucleation barrier and a kinetic prefactor may be impossible .",
    "similar problems arise in other systems where the liquid to solid transition is not driven by enhancing the density , as is done in the generic case of colloids described as a hard sphere fluid @xcite , but by reducing the temperature : in fluids such as silica @xcite , triphenyl phosphite @xcite and ortho - terphenyl @xcite strong supercooling is possible and ultimately a glass transition @xcite is reached .",
    "nucleation competing with glass formation @xcite shall not be considered here , and also the interplay of crystallization with a liquid - liquid unmixing , as it has been proposed for water and various other liquids @xcite is out of our focus .",
    "the present paper hence is only concerned with the first problem , of predicting the nucleation barrier associated with the formation of crystalline nuclei , but avoiding the assumption that @xmath3 actually is isotropic and the nuclei are spherical . a central element of the present paper , however , is , that the nucleation barrier can be obtained directly from a careful analysis of the equilibrium conditions for the nucleus and the surrounding fluid phase @xcite . while in the thermodynamic limit this surrounding fluid phase is metastable",
    ", we show that in finite systems there actually occurs a stable equilibrium between the small crystalline nucleus and this surrounding fluid phase .",
    "we show , using a simple model for a suspension of colloids with short - range attractive interactions , that in this method there is no longer any need to obtain @xmath3 and to carry out the wulff construction .",
    "while the precise shape of the crystalline nucleus is not found in this approach , nucleation barriers can be estimated with reasonable precision .    in the next section",
    ", we shall describe the model that we use , a variant of the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model @xcite for colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite , and summarize what is known on the thermodynamic properties of this model in the bulk .",
    "we recall here that the ao model contains the widely studied case of the hard sphere fluid as special case , but has the merit that the control parameters of the attractive part of the potential ( its depth and its range , respectively ) can easily be tuned ( experimentally this could be done by varying the concentration of polymers in the suspension , and their size via choosing different molecular weights @xcite ) .",
    "since in this way both the density gap @xmath4 ( onset of melting of the crystal occurs at a density @xmath5 , onset of freezing of the fluid occurs at @xmath6 ) and the interfacial tension @xmath3 can be varied over a wide range , the system qualifies as a model suitable to stringently test the theory .    in section 3 , the preparation of the inhomogeneous systems , where a crystalline nucleus coexists with surrounding fluid in a finite simulation box , is described in detail , since the equilibration of such systems exhibiting two - phase coexistence is notoriously difficult @xcite .",
    "we also introduce the local bond orientational order parameters @xcite that are used to identify ( in each system configuration that needs to be further analyzed ) where the crystalline nucleus ( and its interface separating it from the surrounding fluid ) is located .",
    "note that the identification of interfaces between coexisting phases at the single particle level involves important ambiguities @xcite ; we feel that previous work where the estimation of the nucleation barrier as function of the nucleus size was attempted , based on such methods , possibly somewhat suffered from this ambiguity .    in sec .",
    "4 the thermodynamic method utilized in the present paper , where the density @xmath7 , pressure @xmath8 , and chemical potential @xmath9 of the liquid surrounding the crystal nucleus are accurately estimated , for a wide range of total particle densities @xmath10 ( varying the simulation box volume @xmath11 for several choices of the number @xmath12 of colloidal particles ) . we explain how from an analysis of this equilibrium we can infer both the volume @xmath13 of the crystalline nucleus , and the associated free energy barrier @xmath14 .    finally , in sec .",
    "5 we give a brief summary of our results , and an outlook on further related problems .",

    "one can avoid polymer adsorption on the colloids , and screen out the attractive van der waals interaction between the colloids , avoiding their aggregation .",
    "the ao model provides a simplified description of the statistical thermodynamics of such a system , representing the colloids as hard spheres of diameter @xmath23 , and the polymers as soft spheres of diameter @xmath24 .",
    "while polymer - colloid overlap is also strictly forbidden , polymers can overlap each other with zero energy cost @xcite . as is well known the depletion effect causes an ( entropic ) effective interaction between the colloids .",
    "note that the molecular solvent in this model is not explicitly regarded at all .",
    "if the size ratio @xmath25 is small enough @xmath26 @xcite ) , one can derive an equivalent one - component model ( which we refer to as `` effective ao model '' in the following ) of a colloidal fluid , where the particles interact with the following effective potential : @xmath27 here @xmath16 is the radial distance between two colloidal particles , and @xmath28 the polymer fugacity ( @xmath29 is the polymer chemical potential and @xmath30 their thermal de broglie wavelength ) . in the following",

    "there is no need to stick exactly to the potential , eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , but one can equally well consider a model where the singular behavior at @xmath33 has been replaced by a smooth function .",
    "thus we replace the hard core part of eq .",

    "[ eq1 ] and eq .",
    ".    for this softeffao model the application of the virial formula is straightforwardly possible , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the equation of state of both models is very similar , for the choice @xmath18 , and @xmath38 that will be studied here .",
    "here we have defined the packing fraction @xmath39 of the colloids and the polymer reservoir packing fraction @xmath40 as @xmath41 @xmath42     normalized pressure @xmath43 plotted vs. @xmath39 for both the effao model ( squares ) and the soft effao model ( circles ) .",
    "full curves through the data points are guides to the eye only , and statistical errors are smaller than the size of the symbols , and hence not shown .",
    "note that the equation of state contains two disjunct functions ; one for the liquid branch @xmath44 ) and one for the crystalline solid ( @xmath45 ) ( which has a face - centered cubic ( fcc ) structure ) , respectively .",

    "3 ) , and the coexistence packing fractions then result from @xmath49 with @xmath50 being the inverse functions of @xmath51 .",

    "[ fig2 ] contains two branches , the liquid branch ( at the left ) and the solid branch ( representing a face - centered cubic ( fcc ) crystal , at the right ) .",
    "actually the solid branch was computed in the npt ensemble , choosing a cubic box with @xmath52 particles , arranged at the sites of a fcc lattice as initial condition .",
    "simulations where only the total volume @xmath54 is allowed to fluctuate or where the simulation box linear dimensions @xmath55 in the three cartesian directions are allowed to fluctuate independently gave ( within statistical errors ) identical results for the function @xmath56 that is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in our simulations , we have disregarded the alternative hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) structure throughout , since it is not expected to be the stable phase  @xcite .",
    "of course , it nevertheless would be interesting to study crystal nuclei having the hcp structure surrounded by fluid , applying the technique of the present work , and to compare their nucleation barriers to those of fcc nuclei .",
    "however , this interesting issue must be left to future work .",
    "the liquid branch was obtained from both runs in the @xmath57 ensemble and in the nvt ensemble ( sampling then @xmath58 at given fixed @xmath39 from the virial expression @xcite ) . within statistical errors ,",
    "the results from the npt and nvt ensembles agree precisely , indicating hence that finite size effects on the isotherms for @xmath59 are already negligible .",
    "we also note that for the ranges of @xmath39 shown we never could observe a spontaneous crystallization of the liquid , nor a spontaneous melting of the solid .",
    "this implies that the time span of the simulation runs was too short to observe a decay of a metastable phase via nucleation and growth .",
    "it also is interesting to ask for the effect of choosing different parameters @xmath60 and @xmath35 in the potential , eq .  [ eq2 ] .",
    "one can show that increasing @xmath60 has the effect of displacing the liquid branch slightly ( and almost uniformly ) to the left .",
    "the effect on the solid branch is much more pronounced , however , it is shifted to the left by much larger extent , and hence the width of the liquid - solid coexistence region decreases @xcite .    in thermal equilibrium",

    "this conclusion seems to be at variance with both experimental and simulation studies on nucleation in colloidal suspensions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , we feel that most of this work has been done for conditions where @xmath284 is much larger than in the present work , so actually the nucleation barrier is then rather small ; our pressure range @xmath285 for the pressure of the metastable fluid ( fig .  [ fig11 ] ) translates into packing fractions @xmath286 of the fluid surrounding the crystalline nucleus in our box .",
    "these numbers are close to @xmath287 , the relative distance from the transition where freezing sets in is at most 6% .",
    "in contrast , experiments @xcite and simulations for hard spheres @xcite typically deal with packing fractions in the range @xmath288 ( note that within the available accuracy @xmath153 in our model agrees with the corresponding value for hard spheres ) .",
    "note that this range of the experiments corresponds to huge values of @xmath289 ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and correspondingly the estimate      that classical nucleation theory would imply yields droplet radii that do not exceed about two colloid diameters , and barriers that are only of the order of 5 to 10 @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that for such small nuclei the approximations of the classical nucleation theory are expected to fail . on the other hand , for",
    "such dense colloidal suspensions the nucleation rate will be strongly affected by the slowing down that sets in when the colloidal glass transition @xcite is approached .",
    "in fact , radu and schilling @xcite have pointed out a strong and nontrivial effect due to the kinetic prefactor of the nucleation rate .",
    "since the slowing down associated with the glass transition is not a well understood problem @xcite , studies attempting to test nucleation theory should avoid this region , and focus on the region close to @xmath153 , as done here .",
    "finally , we discuss the issue why the spherical approximation is such a good approximation to the actual crystal shape in this case .",
    "the simple explanation is that the anisotropy pf the interfacial tension of the crystal fluid interface in this model is very weak , the difference between @xmath291 and @xmath292 is a few % only .",
    "a similar situation also arises in the lattice gas model @xcite , at temperatures well above the roughening temperature .",
    "recent work @xcite has studied the angular dependence of the interface tension in this model over a wide range of temperatures , showing that the dependence on interface tension on interface orientation amounts to a variation of typically a few % as well ( this anisotropy vanishes at the critical point of this model ) .",
    "the corresponding enhancement of the nucleation barrier was found to be of the order of 10 % as well @xcite ; only at low temperatures , where facetted crystal shapes occur , large derivations from the spherical approximations were found @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that the present findings are generic for all systems where the anisotropy of the interfacial tension at melting conditions amounts only a few % .    :",

    "<S> as a model for a suspension of hard - sphere like colloidal particles where small nonadsorbing dissolved polymers create a depletion attraction , we introduce an effective colloid - colloid potential closely related to the asakura - oosawa model but that does not have any discontinuities . in simulations , </S>",
    "<S> this model straightforwardly allows the calculation of the pressure from the virial formula , and the phase transition in the bulk from the liquid to crystalline solid can be accurately located from a study where a stable coexistence of a crystalline slab with a surrounding liquid phase occurs . for this model , </S>",
    "<S> crystalline nuclei surrounded by fluid are studied both by identifying the crystal - fluid interface on the particle level ( using suitable bond orientational order parameters to distinguish the phases ) and by `` thermodynamic '' means . </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , the latter method amounts to compute the enhancement of chemical potential and pressure relative to their coexistence values . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the chemical potential can be obtained from simulating thick films , where one wall with a rather long range repulsion is present , since near this wall the widom particle insertion method works , exploiting the fact that the chemical potential in the system is homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the surface excess free energy of the nucleus is obtained , for a wide range of nuclei volumes . from this method </S>",
    "<S> , it is established that classical nucleation theory works , showing that for the present model the anisotropy of the interface excess free energy of crystals and their resulting nonspherical shape has only a very small effect on the barrier . </S>"
