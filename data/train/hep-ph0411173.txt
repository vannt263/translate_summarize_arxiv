    "<S> the similarities and differences between both scenarios are discussed . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the lifetimes of these mesons decrease significantly at the critical point , although this might not be sufficient to observe enhancement of these decays in heavy - ion collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of pseudoscalar meson observables at high density or temperature is a topic that has attracted a lot of attention , having in mind that possible modifications in the mass spectrum , lifetime and widths of those mesons could provide signatures for the restoration of symmetries associated to phase transitions that are expected to take place at high temperature or density @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic decays of the neutral pseudoscalar mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 deserve special attention and calculations of such observables in the framework of different models may be found in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the decays @xmath3 are responsible for the great percentage of photons in the background of heavy - ion collisions , which makes these processes particularly interesting . </S>",
    "<S> an open question is whether enhancement or suppression of @xmath3 will be found in experiments of heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> although the lifetimes of these neutral mesons are much longer than hadronic time scales and its decays might not be observed inside the fireball , it is nevertheless important to understand the physics underlying these processes , that is probably the same of more complex anomalous mesonic decays ( @xmath4 ) , relevant for heavy - ion collisions @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    temperature effects on the process @xmath5 have been object of several studies @xcite but less attention has been given to the investigation of @xmath6 . since the structure of the @xmath2 exhibits a mixing of strange and non strange quarks , the calculation of temperature and density effects for this decay , which is more involved than for @xmath7 , might carry relevant information concerning the restoration of symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , chiral symmetry shows a tendency to be restored in the non strange sector , but the same is not evident for the strange sector , which makes the study of the electromagnetic @xmath2 decay particularly interesting . </S>",
    "<S> although , in general , the behavior of several observables with temperature is qualitatively similar to that with density , there are fundamental differences between media with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition is probably a smooth crossover and there are threshold effects on the mesons , that dissociate in @xmath10 pairs at the mott temperature ; in the second case the phase transition is first order and the threshold effects mentioned above do not generally take place . </S>",
    "<S> the question whether these differences will affect significantly the decays @xmath11 should be clarified .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform our calculations in the framework of the three  flavor nambu - jona - lasinio model [ njl ] @xcite , including the determinantal t hooft interaction that breaks the @xmath12 symmetry , that has the following lagrangian : @xmath13 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & g_d\\,\\{\\mbox{det}\\,[\\bar q\\,(1+\\gamma_5)\\,q ] + \\mbox{det } \\,[\\bar q\\,(1-\\gamma_5)\\,q]\\}. \\label{1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the calculation of the decays @xmath14 we consider the triangle diagrams for the electromagnetic meson decays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding invariant amplitudes are given by ( the details can be found in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) : @xmath15 as we have shown in @xcite , there is a good overall agreement between our results for these quantities , calculated in the vacuum , and the experimental values @xcite .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we plot @xmath16 , as functions of temperature and density for @xmath1 and for the @xmath2 .     </S>",

    "<S> 1 , right panel ) , although qualitatively similar to @xmath5 , it depends on the strange and non strange quark masses and related quantities , on the couplings of the meson to the quarks and also on the mixing angle @xmath21 ( see @xcite , fig . 2 and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the mixing angle is very smooth , but threshold effects on the remaining quantities lead to a behavior similar to the case of the pion . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is that the peak for the decay amplitude occurs before the mott temperature for the @xmath2 , @xmath22 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us discuss our results at finite density . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case of asymmetric quark matter with strange quarks in @xmath23equilibrium @xcite .    our results for the medium effects on the two photon decay of @xmath1 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , </S>",
    "<S> are plotted in fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , left panel . </S>",
    "<S> a meaningful difference between the behavior at @xmath26 and @xmath27 is that , in the last case , although with a weaker coupling to the quarks , the mesons are still bound states , even at high densities . as a consequence , the sharp threshold effects occurring in the finite temperature case do not take place now , and the behavior of the different quantities is more smooth . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of @xmath28 , as well as @xmath29 has a simple interpretation , it reflects the fact that @xmath30 and @xmath31 decrease with density . </S>",
    "<S> as it was shown in @xcite , the decrease of the quark mass is more pronounced than the decrease of @xmath31 , in the region @xmath32 the behavior of the transition amplitude is dictated by a compromise between the behavior of the mass and the meson quark coupling , and above @xmath33 the mass decrease seems to be the dominant effect . </S>",
    "<S> concerning @xmath34 it has a maximum at about the critical density , since there are two competitive effects , on one side the decrease of the transition amplitude and , on the other side , the increase of the pion mass . above the critical density the two photon decay of </S>",
    "<S> the pion becomes less favorable , what reflects that it turns a weaker bound @xmath10 pair , as already mentioned before . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with recent experimental results indicating that pionic degrees of freedom are less relevant at high densities @xcite .    concerning the @xmath6 decay , although qualitatively similar to @xmath5 , there are differences that are related to the evolution of the strange quark content of this meson and the behavior of the strange quark in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> it was show in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the mixing angle ( @xmath35 in the vacuum ) decreases with density , has a minimum @xmath36 ) at @xmath37 , equals to zero at @xmath38 , then it increases rapidly up to the value @xmath39 , when strange valence quarks appear in the medium ( @xmath40 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , at high densities the @xmath2 is governed by the behavior of the strange quark mass but , the results for the observables of the @xmath6 decay , which are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , right panel , are qualitatively similar to those of @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is that the width @xmath42 almost vanishes above @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior of the @xmath2 seems to indicate that the role of the @xmath12 anomaly for the mass of this meson at high densities is less important .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we show that these anomalous decays are significantly affected by the medium , leading to an enhancement of the width around the mott temperature and @xmath33 . however , this enhancement is probably not sufficient to lead to lifetimes shorter than the expected lifetime of the fireball . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental results from phenix @xcite show that @xmath1 production is suppressed in the central region of au@xmath44au collisions as compared to the peripherical region . </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath5 decay could only be interesting for experimental heavy - ion collisions at intermediate temperatures and densities . </S>",
    "<S> however , although the peak of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 widths are at moderate temperature , the decays are probably observed only after freeze - out , since its life times , @xmath45 , are still of the order of @xmath46s and @xmath47s , respectively , much larger than the expected lifetime of the fireball , @xmath48s . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion is obtained for matter at finite density and zero temperature , although the behavior of the relevant observables is more smooth . </S>"
