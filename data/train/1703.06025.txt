    "<S> the energy difference between the initial and asymptotic states of the chain and mode @xmath34 is given by : @xmath41 note that in the limit of large @xmath40 , the energy balance of the mode @xmath34 is the difference between the energies of the initial and the asymptotic state of the mode @xmath34 : @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be equal to the energy lost of the whole mode @xmath34 plus _ dicc _ system , which holds for signal states satisfying @xmath43 .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , erasure of the state of mode @xmath34 can be performed without energy change of our reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> such an action seems to contradict the famous landauer s erasure principle : in order to erase information irreversibly , by action of the environment , energy transfer into the environment need to occur @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this principle was formulated for classical systems . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum landauer s principle holds under different assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> these consist of the reservoir being a closed , gibbs state system , which is entirely uncorrelated with the signal state . </S>",
    "<S> if the reservoir is not isolated from the environment , the applicability of the landauer s principle is questionable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the use of an additional quantum system coupled to the reservoir allows the state of the signal to be erased without entropic change . </S>",

    "<S> the dissipative coupling of bosonic modes can allow light to flow like heat , whilst retaining coherence and even entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> a linear system of dissipatively coupled waveguides can act as an optical equaliser , smoothing fluctuations in amplitude and phase towards a common output . </S>",
    "<S> non - classical input will evolve into a completely symmetrized , correlated , state of the whole system . </S>",
    "<S> this equalising action has been experimentally demonstrated in an elementary photonic circuit ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) and for the chain of five waveguides ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , we have outlined dissipative circuits which can catalytically direct the flow of light across multiple channels , or even support stationary lattice states without impurity . in context of quantum thermodynamics , the _ dicc </S>",
    "<S> _ itself can be considered as a reservoir with non - trivial properties . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the state of the reservoir can remain unchanged throughout the process of interaction with an external , `` signal '' mode and allow non - landauer erasure to be performed . </S>",
    "<S> further , the optical equalisation and quantum evolution towards a stationary state can be used to study equilibration and thermalisation processes in quantum theory , one of the central problems in quantum thermodynamics @xcite . in the future , we believe that diffusive photonic systems will find practical application both in studying the fundamental processes of structurally engineered open systems and in an array of integrated photonic technologies .    </S>",

    "<S> was mounted on @xmath46-@xmath47-@xmath23 translation stages ( abl1000 ) . </S>",
    "<S> each waveguide was fabricated by translating the stages once through the focus of the fs laser pulses generated by an yb - doped fibre laser ( menlo systems , bluecut ) . </S>",
    "<S> the waveguide arrays were characterised using single - mode - fibre input coupling and free - space output coupling . to excite waveguides with tunable wavelength of light , </S>",
    "<S> a photonic crystal fibre  @xcite was pumped by sub - picosecond laser pulses of @xmath48  nm wavelength to generate a broadband supercontinuum . </S>",
    "<S> a tunable monochromator placed after the supercontinuum source was used to select narrow band ( @xmath49  nm ) light , which was coupled into an optical fibre ( smf-@xmath50 ) . </S>",
