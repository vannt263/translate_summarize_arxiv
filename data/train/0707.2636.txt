    "the co integrated intensity ( ) and temperature maps ( ) both show the same features : a bright nucleus , a broad asymmetrical spiral arm pattern and the overall asymmetrical distribution of the disk emission .",

    "the rms of these 10.4  channels is three times as high as for co(1 - 0 ) , so the maps are less sensitive to faint emission .",

    "the bright nucleus and asymmetric distribution of arm and disk emission are also apparent in the integrated intensity , , and peak main beam brightness temperature , , maps ( figures [ co21.m0tb]a and [ co21.m0tb]b ) . the co(2 - 1 ) emission in ngc  6946 is almost as extensive as that of the co(1 - 0 ) : the north - south and east - west dimensions are only 1  shorter .",
    "the observed co(2 - 1 ) emission covers the brighter portions of the dss optical image of ngc  6946 , figure [ co21.m0tb]c .",
    "the nuclear peak of the co(2 - 1 ) integrated intensity map is at ( j2000 ) with @xmath53 . using a galactic disk @xmath41",
    ", this corresponds to a peak column density of @xmath54   or 450  averaged over the 790 pc beam .",

    "the largest  value , 0.85 k , occurs at the same location as the peak and both peaks are consistent with the location of the  peak .    at the resolution presented of maps , inside a 2  ( 3.5 kpc ) radius both the co(2 - 1 ) and co(1 - 0 ) emission trace a broad 2 arm pattern . at a 2.5  radius ( 4.4 kpc ) the co(2 - 1 ) still traces a broad 2 arm pattern while the co(1 - 0 ) emission from a larger beam has clearly bifurcated into a 4 arm spiral ( figure [ coaz]a ) . at a 3.5  radius ( 6.1 kpc ) 5",
    "arms are discernible in azimuthal emission plots of both co emission lines ( figure [ coaz]b ) .",
    "along the optical arm pattern the co(2 - 1 ) emission is uneven , ( figure [ co21.m0tb]c ) with typical variations of 15 and 5  separated by 40  or less .",
    "this same clumpy pattern of co arm emission can be seen in the 22  co(1 - 0 ) and co(3 - 2 ) maps presented by @xcite .",
    "the emission on each arm at the same galacto - centric radius is also uneven as can be seen in figures [ coaz]a and b.    at 27  resolution it becomes possible to distinguish between arm and interarm emission .",
    "the  contrast between the brighter , on arm , clumps and obvious off - arm regions is @xmath57 . using the dss optical image to mask the outer ( r@xmath4 2.5 ) arm / interarm regions ,",
    "we obtain a mean arm / interarm contrast of 2.4 . this is higher than both the",
    "1.2 and 1.8 values found from co(1 - 0 ) and co(3 - 2 ) iram observations of @xcite who interpret the increase in contrast at the higher co transitions verses co(1 - 0 ) as evidence that the on - arm molecular gas is warmer .",
    "the presence of widespread interarm gas becomes plainly apparent in a comparison to an optical image , figure [ co21.m0tb]c .",
    "the fact that interarm co(2 - 1 ) is present and at emission levels comparable to co(1 - 0 ) suggests that the interarm gas is also not very cold and that it must be warmer than @xmath58 k. this widespread distribution of interarm gas is not seen in the @xcite co(2 - 1 ) survey of the milky way .",
    "a co ratio map , @xmath59 , is presented in figure [ rco]a .",
    "the co(2 - 1 ) channel cube was convolved to the beam size of the co(1 - 0 ) data and the @xmath60 emission from the beam matched cubes was used to produce the  map .",
    "the spiral pattern is only weakly reflected in the  map .",
    "outside of the inner few arcminute radius the pattern breaks up into a patchwork of high and low  regions .",
    "the ratio uncertainty for the regions of strong emission is dominated by the error in the conversion to main beam temperature , while the uncertainty for the weaker emission regions is dominated by the rms noise in the contributing channels of emission .",
    "adding in quadrature the fractional uncertainties from the  maps we obtain an error estimate on the order of 15% at the nucleus , 25% along the spiral arm pattern , and 40% for the outer disk ratios .",
    "we were concerned that the ratio might be biased towards higher values due to the uncertainty in the denominator .",
    "we performed a standard statistical analysis to correct a ratio for bias this bias .",
    "the bias corrected  map was not significantly different from the map presented in figure [ rco]a and well within our reported error . despite the large uncertainty estimates , our ratios are consistent with those derived from other independent observations @xcite .    in principle , , the ratio of co(2 - 1 ) to co(1 - 0 ) integrated intensities , gives information on the excitation of the co emission and depending on circumstances , the kinetic temperature , .",
    "the observed main beam temperature at frequency , @xmath61 , is related to a planck function , , with excitation temperature , , by the areal beam filling factor , , a conversion to the rayleigh - jeans temperature scale , and radiative transfer through a optical depth , : @xmath62including a correction for the cosmic microwave background contribution to the beam , , at temperature 2.73 k. standard assumptions are that  is the same for both emission lines , that both lines are optically thick ( @xmath63 ) and that the emission can be characterized by a single   @xcite . with these assumptions",
    "we can naively derive  values for the emission :  = 0.9 corresponds to  = 20 k , while  = 0.5 corresponds to  = 3.5 k. higher ratio values are found in the nuclear regions of starburst galaxies where elevated star formation heats the molecular gas ; lower values are typical of cold or subthermally excited ( @xmath64 ) disk molecular clouds .",
    "values of @xmath65 indicate optically thin gas in this picture .    within 1  of the nucleus , @xmath66 .",
    "this is consistent with other studies @xcite that indicate the presence of relatively dense molecular gas as temperatures of about @xmath67 k. this is comparable to the milky way mean  of 0.74 @xcite .    along",
    "the optical arms the mean  is 0.83 , ranging from 0.44 to 1.4 . to within our uncertainties , this is the same as the 0.73 mean found for milky way molecular arms where a similar range of   values is found @xcite . from a naive interpretation of the ratios , a mean  of 12 k is implied for the arm co in ngc  6946 .",
    "@xcite concluded that the interarm  does not differ significantly from that of the arms based on observations of two circular regions in the arms , one on the east side of ngc  6946 , the other on the west side .",
    "the two circular regions they observed have a mean  of 0.8 in our ratio map , also not significantly different from that of the arm regions .",
    "however when larger regions of the co disk are sampled , a very different picture emerges .",
    "there are regions ( 5% of the ratio map ) where @xmath68 indicating cold ( @xmath69 5 k ) or sub - thermally excited co. there are also much larger regions where @xmath65",
    ".    very high ratio , @xmath65 , gas covers 50% of our ratio map ; and these are predominantly interarm regions , figure [ rco]b .",
    "we have eliminated the possibility that these very high ratios are due to contributions from the telescope error beam at 230 ghz : the error beam at the 12 meter telescope is a measured quantity and modeling of the error beam contribution in the individual channel maps shows that it contributes at most a few percent of the emission in the  map .",
    "the high  ratios appear to indicate the presence of widespread , warm , optically thin co - emitting gas in the interarm regions . while optically thin co emission is not typical of galactic molecular clouds , our large beam and unusual perspective from outside the disk of ngc  6946 may allow us to trace a component that is difficult to detect in the galaxy .",
    "we note that the photon - dominated regions ( pdr ) around cool stars can produce bright co emission with high temperatures @xcite since their softer radiation fields allow the co to be photoelectrically - warmed at low a@xmath70 .",
    "also , as pointed out by @xcite it does not take much optically thin gas to swing the emissivity ; the co(2 - 1 ) emission that we see could easily come from a small amount of optically thin , but ",
    "co - loud \" gas that is not the dominant cloud population .",
    "other less likely possibilities are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have also seen a have a high overall @xmath71 in m83 @xcite ; confirming earlier reports of unusually high  in these two galaxies @xcite .",
    "large scale  maps of the milky way @xcite show high ratios in immediate proximity to pockets of star formation .",
    "the widespread regions of high  seen in m83 and ngc  6946 are not seen in surveys of co in our galaxy .",
    "although co emission covers only 15% of the hi disk surface area , ngc  6946 is nevertheless a molecular gas - rich galaxy ; 1/3 of the hydrogen gas disk is in molecular form .",
    "this is consistent with the 36% value from @xcite once the flux missed in the interferometer hi maps is taken into account .    in figure [ hico]a , we present our co(1 - 0 ) emission in contours superimposed on a grey scale image of the hi emission .",
    "this image shows that co emission fills the inner 6  of the hi disk .",
    "the hi disk has a central depression , which rises to peaks in a clumpy ring of emission .",
    "the hi ring is coincident with the outer boundary of co(1 - 0 ) . while spiral structure is readily apparent in the outer hi disk @xcite , it is insignificant in the inner disk , r@xmath72  ( 9 kpc ) , where the hi column densities decline and @xmath73 takes over . at 1  resolution",
    "there are no obvious systematic displacements of the hi relative to the co(1 - 0 ) spiral structure other than the strongest hi tends to be near the outermost ends of the co(1 - 0 ) arms .",
    "in fact , if anything , hi and co peaks tend to coincide , which is more apparent in the higher resolution co(2 - 1 ) maps .",
    "the co(2 - 1 ) image in contours is shown in figure [ hico]b , again with a grey scale image of hi . outside the inner 2  ( 3.5 kpc ) region of the hi depression",
    ", the peaks of co(2 - 1 ) emission tend to coincide with hi peaks along the ring .",
    "this could be evidence for photodissociated  creating a higher hi column density at these locations . @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggest the same explanation for hi in the spiral arms of m51 , m83 and m33 .    from these images ,",
    "we have constructed plots of the azimuthally - averaged gas surface densities , ,  and , as a function of galactocentric radius in figure [ sdg_r ] ( corrected for inclination ) .",
    "this is similar to the plot of @xcite , which was based on a radial cross map , and those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "dominates the neutral gas distribution in within the central 3  ( 5 kpc ) of ngc  6946 , rapidly fading into a predominantly hi disk beyond .",
    "a least squares fit of an exponential to over the entire range of radii has a scale length of @xmath74 ( 1.8 kpc ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite obtained scale lengths of 1.5and 1.4  for the co disk from fcrao and iram single disk observations ; @xcite obtained 1.3  from the bima interferometer survey data combined with nrao 12 m observations .",

    "<S> the very high ratios are predominantly from interarm regions and appear to indicate the presence of wide - spread optically thin gas . </S>",
    "<S> star formation tracers are better correlated with the total neutral gas disk than with the molecular gas by itself implying @xmath3 . using the 100  and 21 cm continuum from ngc  6946 as star formation tracers , we arrive at a gas consumption timescale of 2.8 gyr , which is relatively uniform across the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the high star formation rate at the nucleus appears to be due to a large accumulation of molecular gas rather than a large increase in the star formation efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the mid - plane gas pressure in the outer ( r @xmath4 10 kpc ) hi arms of ngc  6946 is close to the value at the radial limit ( 10 kpc ) of our observed co disk . if the mid - plane gas pressure is a factor for the formation of molecular clouds , these outer hi gas arms should contain molecular gas which we do not see because they are beyond our detection limit . </S>"
