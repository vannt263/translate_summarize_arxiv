    "these fluctuations are of course present , and they may lead to broader and less pronounced response maxima and minima . therefore , in this paper we shall study the frequency dependence of the response to a modulated energy input rate into a system where turbulent fluctuations are included . in particular , we shall address the question whether the response maxima and minima can still be well identified in the presence of fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , we not only consider a modulated energy input rate , but also discuss the slightly different case of a modulated driving force in order to compare with the above mentioned experiments .    an appropriate way to numerically study the problem of modulated turbulence would be a direct numerical simulation of the navier - stokes equation for this specific time - dependent energy input rate .",

    "the goy model has been successfully used in a study about decaying and kicked turbulence @xcite .",

    "we calculate the response of the system to a modulated energy input rate within a reduced wave vector set approximation ( rewa ) , @xcite , where the navier - stokes equation is solved on a reduced , geometrically scaling subset of wave vectors .",
    "this method is much closer to the navier - stokes dynamics than the goy - model , as it contains ( i ) much more modes than goy , ( ii ) it solves the navier - stokes equation for those modes and not only a model equation , and ( iii ) it is three dimensional .",

    "the higher order maxima and minima are not visible in the simulations , but are completely washed out by fluctuations . on the other hand , we emphasize that the turbulent fluctuations in the goy model are strongly overestimated due to the extreme mode reduction in this model . in the rewa simulation , an artificially large kolmogorov constant @xmath39 is found .",

    "therefore , the higher order maxima are not visible in the rewa simulations .",
    "the cascade time shows about 2% fluctuations in rewa as shown in fig .",
    "[ tauwidthrewafig ] . however , at small response amplitudes these fluctuations are already large enough to wash out the higher order response maxima .    in conclusion ,",
    "the rewa system reproduces qualitatively the features of modulated turbulence as predicted by the mean - field model including the first response maximum .",
    "the latter is considerably weakened due to the large kolmogorov constant in rewa .",
    "another consequence of the large @xmath39 is , that the crossover between constant amplitude and @xmath0-decay is shifted towards smaller frequencies , and therefore the higher order maxima and minima are already at very small amplitudes where the fluctuations in the cascade time scale are finally large enough to wash them out .",
    "we can not clarify , at present , how close the response in direct numerical simulations  which lead to an order of magnitude",

    "well reproduce the basic trend , i.e. , the constant amplitude for small @xmath5 and the @xmath0-decrease for large @xmath5 .",
    "the main response maximum can be observed in both numerical models , although it is weakened due to fluctuations .",
    "the higher order maxima and minima as predicted by the mean - field theory can not be identified in the simulations . obviously , they are strongly washed out by fluctuations . in the goy model",
    "the large fluctuations are explicitly visible in a broad cascade time distribution .",
    "we attribute these fluctuations to the strong mode reduction in the model , i.e. , they are an artifact of the model properties and not a feature of real turbulence . in the reduced wave vector set approximation of the navier - stokes equation these fluctuations",
    "are much weaker , and , we believe , more realistic for real turbulence , as more modes are taken into account . however , due to an overestimated kolmogorov constant @xmath39 in rewa the higher order maxima are considerably reduced , and therefore washed out by the fluctuations although being smaller than the goy - fluctuations",
    ". therefore , we believe , that in real turbulence with a realistic kolmogorov constant the first maximum should be clearly observable and possibly also the higher order extrema in the response . thus , the predictions of the mean - field model , which excludes _ all _ fluctuations , might be quite reasonable for real turbulence . to further study the response maxima numerically ,",
    "it is necessary to perform full numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equation , as then all relevant time scales including their fluctuations are reproduced realistically , which turned out to be essential for the observation of the response maxima .",

    "we have studied this case also within the mean - field model and have found basically the same behavior of the energy response as for a modulated energy input rate .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the energy input rate showed `` wiggles '' at the same frequencies where the energy response had maxima . in the experiments",
    "the response maxima were measured in the energy input rate , which can be regarded as a response of the system as well in this case .",

    "also in this simulation , the response amplitude behaves basically as in the mean - field model , i.e. , it decreases as @xmath0 .",
    "the energy response amplitude as well as the amplitude of the energy input rate show the main maximum .",
    "due to the above mentioned large fluctuations all higher order maxima are washed out in the goy model .",
    "there are two regimes in the frequency behavior of the response amplitude , namely a constant amplitude at low @xmath5 and a decreasing amplitude at high @xmath5 .",
    "the present simulations give further confidence that the crossover frequency between these two regimes gives the correct order of magnitude of the cascade time scale , i.e. , in experiments it can be used to measure this time scale as suggested in reference @xcite .",
