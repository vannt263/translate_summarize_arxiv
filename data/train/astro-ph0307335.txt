    "as photons from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) travel to us from the surface of last scattering , they can experience a number of physical processes .",
    "these include the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz@xcite ) effect , which is the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by a hot ( @xmath0 k ) ionized gas@xcite , and the late integrated sachs  wolfe ( isw@xcite ) effect , which is the integrated differential gravitational redshift caused by the evolution of gravitational potentials along the path traveled by the photons . at frequencies less",
    "than @xmath1 ghz , the sz effect produces an anti - correlation between the temperature of the cmb and galaxies on small angular scales .",
    "the isw effect generates a weak positive correlation at large angular scales for all frequencies@xcite . for a universe with a flat geometry@xcite ,",
    "the detection of any isw effect provides strong physical evidence for the existence of dark energy , and can be used to measure its equation of state @xcite . in this paper , we attempt the detection of the isw and sz effects through the cross - correlation of new , large area , clean galaxy and cmb maps of the sky @xcite , which reduce the errors due to sample variance on large scales and the poisson error on small scales relative to that of previous attempts@xcite .",
    "the parent sdss galaxy data used herein is nearly 25 million galaxies taken from @xmath2 square degrees of the sky imaged by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss@xcite ) .",
    "we apply a flux limit of @xmath3 and regions with poor image quality have been excluded from our analysis ( _ i.e. _ , data with a point ",
    "spread function of worse than 1.5 arcseconds ) . from this basic data set ,",
    "we have constructed four different subsets of galaxies using both the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) selection method@xcite and a photometric redshift estimate for every galaxy@xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : lrg_dndz ] , these subsamples span a range of redshift from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , providing an efficient method for tracing the large  scale distribution of galaxies in the universe as a function of redshift .     the photometric redshift distributions for the four lrg subsamples , taking into account the covariance between photometric redshift and galaxy type .",
    "to select these galaxies , we imposed a color cut of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we then define @xmath8 , and step through @xmath9 in increments of 0.2 starting at @xmath10 and ending at @xmath11 to determine our four redshift samples , from lowest to highest redshift respectively .",
    "there are 0.4 million lrgs in the @xmath12 subsample , 0.8 million in the @xmath13 subsample , 1 million in the @xmath14 subsample , and 0.7 million in the @xmath15 subsample . ]    for the cmb data , we use the 3 primary combined - channel maps ( q , v , w ) from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap@xcite ) , and the `` clean '' map of tegmark et al.@xcite .",
    "we also apply a mask to exclude foreground contamination from the galaxy ( kp12 for the v & w bands and kp2 for the q band ) . to isolate the isw effect",
    ", we also generate a smoothed version of the `` clean '' map , by applying a gaussian kernel with a fwhm of one degree to remove cmb primary anisotropies on small angles .",
    "the natural pixelization scheme for the wmap maps is healpix while for the galaxies it is sdsspixscranton / sdsspix ] .",
    "the latter is a new , hierarchical equal - area pixelization scheme developed specifically for the sdss geometry and fast correlation statistics . for our primary calculations we use the higher resolution sdsspix for accurate weighting , while for the extensive monte carlo simulations discussed below",
    ", we use healpix to take advantage of the spice@xcite for fast cross ",
    "correlation estimations .",
    "both methods required re  pixelization of the original maps .",
    "we have tested our re - pixelization methods by comparing the auto - correlation functions of the original and re  sampled maps and we find identical results and errors .    for the cross - correlation measurement , we use a simple pixel - based estimator . for each pixel",
    "@xmath16 in our map , we determine the galaxy and temperature over - densities ( @xmath17 & @xmath18 , respectively ) , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the temperature in pixel @xmath16 , @xmath21 is the mean temperature , @xmath22 is the total number of galaxies in pixel @xmath16 , and @xmath23 is expected number of galaxies in pixel @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , we can optimally weight each pair of pixels to account for the variation of signal - to - noise ( s / n ) in the pixels .",
    "therefore , the two  point cross - correlation function at angular separation @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath24 is the central value of an angular correlation bin , @xmath26 is the fraction of pixel @xmath16 unmasked , @xmath27 is the inverse of the noise in the wmap pixel , and @xmath28 is unity if the separation between the pixels is within this angular bin and zero otherwise . on large angular scales",
    "the optimal cmb weighting is uniform ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath29 , except where masked ) as the signal is dominated by sample variance rather than poisson noise . for completeness , we calculate the cross - correlation functions for both the uniform and noise  weighted schemes .    to estimate the covariance @xmath30 , we use two methods : jack  knife errors and random cmb maps . for the former ,",
    "we divide our total area into @xmath31 equal - area subsamples and use the jack ",
    "knife estimator@xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mean of @xmath34 for the @xmath31 measurements and @xmath35 is the measurement of the cross - correlation excluding the @xmath16th subsample . in order to produce a stable estimation of the covariance matrix ( non - singular and positive definite ) , we set @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of angular bins .",
    "tests with different values of @xmath31 near to @xmath38 generally produced values of @xmath39 ( see section [ sec : significance ] ) within 15% of the values obtained using @xmath36 .    while the jack  knife method gives a good approximation of the sample variance , it is less sensitive to variance on angular scales larger than the survey size . for a more conservative estimate of the covariance ,",
    "we generated 200 random cmb maps based on the angular power spectrum of the `` clean '' map and 200 random cmb maps based on the angular power spectrum of our smoothed wmap map .",
    "these maps were cross - correlated against the four galaxy maps ( using spice@xcite ) and the results were re - sampled into the same angular bins as used in the sdsspix analysis .",
    "the covariance matrix is then @xmath40",
    "we present the cross  correlation functions for the four redshift subsamples and the four wmap maps in figure  [ fig : lrg_w_gt ] . for the three highest redshift galaxy subsamples ,",
    "we find a consistent non  zero signal .",
    "we also find that the cross ",
    "correlation signal is achromatic in the q , v , w frequency maps .",
    "we see little evidence for an anti - correlation between the galaxy density and cmb temperature on the smallest angular scales , as expected from the sz effect . for the lowest redshift subsample",
    ", we see a different shape to the cross  correlation function and all the angular bins are consistent with zero within their errors .",
    "this lowest redshift subsample also shows a lack of agreement between the q , v , and w frequency maps .",
    "jack  knife errors for the `` clean '' galaxy  wmap cross - correlation function .",
    "the errors on the other functions are nearly identical .",
    "the q map is given by the red line , v by the green line , w by the blue line and smoothed map by the cyan line . ]",
    "our primary concern is the possible contamination of the cmb signal by residual galactic synchrotron or dust emission and the galaxy catalogs by galactic stars .",
    "this could result in a non  zero correlation between the maps . to check against this",
    ", we calculate the stellar over - density in each pixel , using the same color cuts as for the four galaxy subsamples discussed above , and substitute these over - densities into equation  [ eq : estimator ] . for the three highest redshift subsamples ,",
    "we find flat , featureless star - wmap cross - correlation functions consistent with zero at the @xmath41 level .",
    "for the lowest redshift sample ( @xmath42 ) , the star - wmap cross - correlation function is nearly identical to the galaxy  wmap measurement , suggesting significant contamination .",
    "the cross  correlation functions for the three highest redshift galaxy subsamples are achromatic in the wmap q , v and w frequency maps .",
    "in addition to the visual agreement in figure  [ fig : lrg_w_gt ] , we cross - correlated the three highest redshift galaxy subsamples against four linear combinations of the q , v , and w maps .",
    "these combination were designed to detect achromatic effects ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) and possible contamination from synchrotron ( @xmath45 ) and dust emission ( @xmath46 ) . in all 12 cross - correlation functions ,",
    "the signal was suppressed relative to our original galaxy  wmap signal by a factor of @xmath47 on all angular scales with errors consistent with poisson noise from the galaxies . likewise , the shapes of the cross - correlation functions were dissimilar to those seen for the galaxy ",
    "wmap cross - correlation functions .",
    "these observations confirm that our galaxy  wmap measurements are not due to contamination by synchrotron or dust emission from the galaxy , or synchrotron emission the host galaxies themselves@xcite , _ i.e. , _ over the frequency range probed by wmap , the intensity of any synchrotron emission should decrease by an order of magnitude from q to w.      as with any angular correlation measurement , the individual angular bins are highly correlated .",
    "therefore , we need to consider the the full covariance matrix ( @xmath48 ) when checking the statistical significance of our measurements against the null hypothesis of a zero cross  correlation function .",
    "our @xmath39 values are given by @xmath49 where @xmath48 is the covariance matrix derived from either eqn  [ eq : random ] ( random maps ) or eqn  [ eq : jackknife ] ( jack  knife errors ) respectively .",
    "the @xmath39 values for each of our uniform weighted cross  correlation functions , including the smoothed map , are given in table  [ tab : chi2 ] using both covariance matrices .",
    "these values are in reasonable agreement with other measurements of similar cross - correlation functions at larger angles @xcite .",
    "the choice of weighting for the cmb pixels does not change our results significantly .",
    "for the three highest redshift samples , we exclude the null hypothesis at @xmath50 confidence for every wmap band and the `` clean '' and smoothed maps using the jack  knife errors . for the random map errors",
    ", we can exclude the null hypothesis at @xmath50 for only the two highest redshift samples ( excluding the q band and smoothed map ) .",
    "excluding angular bins on scales @xmath51 degrees increases the significance of the smoothed detection with the random map errors but not to the 90% confidence threshold . checking the number of random maps with @xmath39 greater than the values in table  [ tab : chi2 ] verifies that our confidence estimates are correct .",
    "@xmath39 values derived from both covariance matrices ( jack  knife errors given in parentheses ) for @xmath52 angular bins [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we complement the @xmath39 statistical analysis by applying the false discovery rate ( fdr @xcite ) technique to the combination of all of our cross  correlation functions into a single significance test of our whole signal .",
    "the utility of the fdr statistic over combining the individual @xmath39 s for different redshift slices comes from the fact that it is conservative and designed to work with highly correlated datasets .",
    "fdr works by controlling @xmath53 , the fraction of false detections compared to the total number of detections@xcite . for a given @xmath53 ,",
    "the fdr technique provides a threshold above which bins are rejected from a null hypothesis , in this case @xmath54 for all @xmath16 angular bins , with the guarantee that the true number of errors is always @xmath55 . using the three highest redshift subsamples ,",
    "cross - correlated with the five cmb maps ( @xmath56 bins in total ) , we reject , with an @xmath57 , 144 bins with the jack  knife errors and 113 bins for the random cmb map errors .",
    "therefore , at least 108 ( 84 ) of our 150 angular bins are rejected from the null hypothesis using the jack ",
    "knife ( random maps ) errors .",
    "we now compare our results to simple physical models of the isw and sz effects .",
    "a more detailed theoretical analysis of our results will appear in a future paper .",
    "we assume here a @xmath58cdm cosmology given by the fits to the wmapext data@xcite : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "we expect our observed cross - correlation functions to be the sum of the induced correlations from the isw and sz effects@xcite , _ i.e. _ , @xmath65 the isw effect is generated by the decay of gravitational potentials in an open or dark energy dominated universe .",
    "this decay couples to the dark matter momentum , meaning that our galaxy - temperature cross - correlations will be a function of the galaxy - momentum power spectrum : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the co - moving distance , @xmath68 is the linear growth factor , @xmath69 is the linear dark matter power spectra and @xmath70 is the linear galaxy bias at the peak of the galaxy redshift distribution ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the kernel ( @xmath72 ) is given by @xmath73   j_0(k\\theta\\chi),\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the hubble constant , @xmath75 is the cmb temperature today in @xmath76k , @xmath77 is the normalized galaxy distribution and @xmath78 is the zero order bessel function .",
    "the sz effect is the cross - correlation of the average free - electron pressure ( @xmath79 ) along the line of sight , with the projected galaxy density .",
    "the pressure - galaxy power spectrum is therefore , @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are the electron density , electron temperature , and pressure bias of the gas respectively , while @xmath84 represents the path length weighted average . in the rayleigh - jeans portion of the thermal cmb spectrum probed by wmap , the kernel ( @xmath85 ) is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the thompson scattering cross - section and @xmath88 is boltzmann s constant . if we set @xmath81 to the mean electron density at @xmath71 , we have two free parameters to fit to the data , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath70 and @xmath89 .    figure  [ fig : theory_comp ] presents an example of our best fit models for the @xmath14 galaxy subsample cross - correlated with the w - channel wmap map . for this cross ",
    "correlation function , we find that the best fit model is preferred to the null hypothesis ( section [ sec : significance ] ) at the 99% confidence level , based on the observed difference between the @xmath39 values of the model fit ( @xmath90 ) and the null hypothesis ( @xmath91 ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath92 for 2 degrees of freedom , using the jack  knife errors .",
    "if we consider the three highest redshift galaxy subsamples , cross  correlated with the 5 wmap maps ( w , q , v,clean,smoothed ) , we find that , using the jack  knife covariance matrix ( @xmath93 ) , 14 of these 15 cross  correlation functions are better fit by our physical model than by the null hypothesis at the @xmath94 confidence level ( based on the @xmath95 values ) . if we assume the more conservative random map covariance matrix ( @xmath96 ) , then four of the fifteen functions are again rejected at the same confidence ( or eight at @xmath97 confidence ) . in summary , a majority of our cross  correlation functions are much better fit by our physical model than by the null hypothesis .",
    "we find a somewhat stronger sz signal in the higher redshift bins , although the sz effect is always sub - dominant to the isw signal . we also see higher values for @xmath70 for the @xmath15 galaxy subsample than for @xmath13 galaxy subsample , but the fit values of @xmath70 are sensitive to the details of our photometric redshift distributions .",
    "we will present a more detailed analysis and interpretation in a future paper .",
    "galaxy subsample .",
    "the fitted isw cross - correlation function is given by the red line , the sz by the green line and the sum of the two is given by the blue line .",
    "we find @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where the errors are unmarginalized . ]",
    "we present here measurements of the cross - correlation function between the currently available sdss galaxy data and the wmap cmb maps of the sky .",
    "the individual measurements in figure  [ fig : lrg_w_gt ] are significant at the @xmath100 confidence , while fdr strongly rejects the null hypothesis .",
    "the achromatic nature of the signal ( in the q , v , and w frequency channels ) confirms the signal is of cosmological origin .",
    "our results are consistent with the nvss - cmb correlations@xcite , but may be harder to reconcile with other optical  cmb measurements of the isw effect@xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with the predicted isw effect ( which is largely independent of dark energy properties ) and a minor sz contribution . assuming a flat universe , our detection of the isw effect provides independent physical evidence for the existence of dark energy . in future papers , analyzing all available sdss data , we will present a more detailed comparison between the theoretical models and the data , as well consistency checks of the observed correlation amplitude with galaxy biases and dark energy models .",
