    "the first remark is that one can always restrict to _ minimal _ triangulations without losing any potentially interesting manifold .",
    "however , it turns out that dual to a triangulation which is minimal among triangulations of the same manifold , there is often a special spine which is not minimal among simple spines of the same manifold . of course",
    "this can only happen if the corresponding manifold violates one of the topological constraints of proposition  [ special : prop ] , but we know from theorem  [ obstructions : teo ] that in this case the manifold is not hyperbolic , so we can discard it .",

    "it is only step ( 1 ) of the enumeration strategy ( the listing of special spines ) that is not suited to manifolds with annular cusps , and the reason why these manifold are ruled out from @xmath38 .",
