    "<S> we consider the `` modified minimal analytic '' ( mma ) coupling that involves an infrared cut to the standard ma coupling . the mma coupling is a stieltjes function and , as a consequence , the paradiagonal pad approximants converge to the coupling in the entire @xmath0-plane except on the time - like semiaxis below the cut . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence between the narrow width approximation of the discontinuity function of the coupling , on the one hand , and this pad ( rational ) approximation of the coupling , on the other hand , is shown . </S>",
    "<S> we approximate the analytic analogs of the higher powers of mma coupling by rational functions in such a way that the singularity region is respected by the approximants . </S>",
    "<S> several comparisons , for real and complex arguments @xmath0 , between the exact and approximate expressions are made and the speed of convergence is discussed . motivated by the success of these approximants , an improvement of the mma coupling is suggested , and possible uses in the reproduction of experimental data are discussed . </S>"
