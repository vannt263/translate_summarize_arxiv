    "the standard cosmological model has been successfully tested until the nucleosynthesis era , if one assumes the existence of the so called dark sector .",
    "however , the extrapolation of this scenario to higher energies leads to a singularity , where the volume of the universe becomes null , and physical quantities such as energy densities and the space - time curvature diverge in a finite cosmic time .",
    "a natural alternative is to investigate possible quantum effects in this high energy limit , which may avoid such cosmological singularities . indeed , many investigations have shown the elimination of the singularities in quantum cosmological models using the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) @xcite and loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) quantization schemes @xcite .",
    "however , some authors have argued that in the wdw approach the singularity is not avoided @xcite .    in order to deal with these questions",
    ", one must define precisely how one can obtain physical information from the quantum state of the universe : as we know , the standard copenhagen interpretation can not be used in quantum cosmology because it needs a classical external domain where measurements are made outside the quantum system in order to give a physical meaning to the quantum state , and in cosmology one is dealing with a closed quantum system , the universe , without any external classical observers .",
    "hence , one has to use an alternative quantum theory , where external agents do not play any special role , and there are many viable proposals in the literature , for example the ones proposed in @xcite .    among the papers mentioned above questioning the wdw approach , only two ( @xcite ) have specified the interpretation of quantum mechanics they are using , which was the consitent histories approach @xcite . in this framework , probabilities are not assigned to events as in usual quantum mechanics , but to whole histories .",
    "a history of a closed physical system is a succession of properties of this system occurring at different times .",
    "an example of a property of a system is the sentence ` the eigenvalue of the observable @xmath0 is in the set @xmath1 ' . to each property",
    "is associated a projector operator . in the above example",
    ", it would be the projector @xmath2 onto the subspace of the hilbert space containing all eigenvectors of @xmath0 with eigenvalues in the set @xmath1 .",
    "however , as we know , we can not assign probabilities to every history in quantum mechanics .",
    "the interference figure obtained from the two slit experiment is an evidence of this fact .",
    "hence , we must establish what are the conditions on families of histories in order to be possible to assign probabilities to all members of such families .",
    "once we obtain these conditions , we will have the possibility of saying that a history of the universe is more probable than another one , without mentioning observers or measurements .",
    "the wheeler - dewitt quantization of a spatially flat friedmann cosmological model with a massless free scalar field was implemented under this framework .",
    "the resulting wheeler - dewitt equation is a klein - gordon like equation . in that case , as shown by craig and singh @xcite , the cosmological singularities are not avoided if one takes the square - root of the klein - gordon equation and their associated newton - wigner states , and histories concerning properties of the quantum system at only two specific moments of time : the infinity past and the infinity future .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , if one considers the two frequency sectors of the resulting klein - gordon like equation and/or three or more instants of time , the family of histories are not consistent anymore , and no conclusion about the existence of singularities can be made .",
    "furthermore , if one analyzes the same physical system within the de broglie - bohm quantum theory , in which trajectories can be unambiguosly defined through the so called guidance relations , there are plenty of states where quantum bounces occurs in both quantization schemes , and the cosmological singularity disappears . also , in ref .",
    "@xcite the reasons for these discrepant results coming from these two different quantum approaches were discussed : it is due to the fact that the resulting wheeler - dewitt equation of the minisuperspace quantum cosmological model considered is a klein - gordon like equation , not an usual schrdinger like equation .",
    "as we know , the predictions of these two approaches agree in usual physical systems investigated in the laboratory , which obey the schrdinger equation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss carefully this same question concerning the existence of singularities in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) quantum universes , but now considering that the matter content is described by a perfect hydrodynamical fluid , in which case it is known that the resulting wheeler - dewitt equation is a schrdinger like equation .",
    "in this situation , we expect that the consistent histories approach should give the same results as the ones already obtained within the de broglie - bohm quantum theory , namely , that the cosmological singularities are eliminated @xcite . and",
    "indeed , our analysis have shown that in the cases where it is possible to define consistent probabilities for histories ( the models where the spatial curvature is not positive definite ) evaluated in two specific moments ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , the histories without singularities have probability one to occur , as in the de broglie - bohm case . for positive spatial curvature",
    ", we have shown that no consistent probability can be associated to histories concerning those two moments .",
    "the paper will be divided as follows : in section [ ch ] we present the consistent histories framework . in subsection [ classico ]",
    "we present the classical cosmological model and in subsection [ quantico ] we discuss the quantization of the latter . in section [ csflrw ]",
    "we discuss the flrw model in the consistent histories interpretation and then , in subsection [ singularity_criteria ] , we present the criterion for a nonsingular universe in this context . in subection [ resultados ]",
    "we evaluate the probabilities of the flrw quantum universes to reach a singularity in @xmath5 in flat and open universes and in [ fechado ] we discuss the closed case",
    ". finally in [ conclusao ] we present our final remarks .",
    "numerical calculations supporting our results are shown in the appendix .",
    "the consistent histories approach , also known as generalized quantum mechanics ( gqm ) , was proposed initially by griffiths @xcite and omnes @xcite , and later developed in the gravity context mainly by hartle and gell - mann @xcite and halliwell @xcite .",
    "it is a framework in which probabilistic predictions can be made about quantum systems avoiding the need of external classical observers , and preserving most of the conceptual structure of the standard copenhagen interpretation . in this section",
    ", we will present some general aspects of this interpretation that are relevant to the issue of the presence of singularities in quantum cosmology . in this approach , instead of associating probabilities to a single eigenvalue , we assign them to a history , that is , a sequence of time ordered eigenvalue intervals . for a given set of observables @xmath6 with eigenvalue intervals",
    "@xmath7 , a history @xmath8 may be represented by a class operator @xmath9 defined as :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the projector onto the subspace for which the @xmath12th eigenvalue of the observable @xmath13 in time @xmath14 is in the interval @xmath15 . the time dependent projectors are defined using the heisenberg operators , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the evolution operator of the quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath18 ,    @xmath19},\\ ] ]    where we considered @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the imaginary unity .",
    "we are interested in asking questions about the eigenvalue intervals of the scale factor operator , @xmath22 , at some moments of time . the time independent projector operator associated with this is    @xmath23    at this point , we may distinguish two kinds of histories .",
    "the fine - grained histories are the most precise descriptions of a physical system , and deals with the smallest intervals of eigenvalues . on the other hand ,",
    "the coarse - grained histories are partitions of the fine - grained ones , considering larger intervals of eigenvalues .",
    "those histories are defined to answer physical relevant questions , which in our case is whether the universe is singular or not .",
    "the wave function that represents the amplitude for a given initial state to follow the history @xmath8 , the branch wave function , is defined as    @xmath24    which is not normalized .",
    "the branch wave function in ( [ funcao_onda_historia ] ) represents a physical system evolving through a set of instants of time @xmath25 , generally discontinuous .",
    "since it is not a function of time @xmath14 , the branch wave function does not satisfy the schrdinger equation .    in order to have a meaningful notion of probability",
    ", we must require some reasonable conditions upon the probability @xmath26 we want to assign to each history :    [ cond ]    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the identity operator .",
    "following the hartle - gell - mann @xcite approach , we define the decoherence functional for a set of histories @xmath31 , considering pure states only , as    @xmath32    it has been shown that in order to satisfy ( [ cond ] ) , the sufficient condition is :    @xmath33    if the family of histories satisfy ( [ consistencia ] ) , we say that this family is consistent .",
    "since @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 and the decoherence functional is normalized because @xmath36 the probability of a history can then be written as    @xmath37    using ( [ consistencia ] ) , ( [ soma_historias_geral ] ) and ( [ probabilidade_hist ] ) , and considering a consistent family of histories , we can write the decoherence functional as    @xmath38    where @xmath39 represents the probability that the system follows a history @xmath8 . one can interpret condition ( [ consistencia ] ) as demanding that no interference can occur between histories .",
    "with the quantum interpretation specified in the last section , we will calculate the probabilistic predictions concerning the existence of singularities in specific cosmolgical models . in this section",
    "we will introduce flrw models where the matter content is described by a radiation fluid with @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the result can easily be generalized to any equation of state @xmath41 @xcite .",

    "this criterion is developed in @xcite . in the subsection ( [ singularity_criteria ] )",

    "after that , we evaluate the quantum model presented in section [ quantico ] .      to address the question whether the universe is singular or not , one must construct a suitable family of histories . to pursue that , we focus on the behavior of the scale factor . we say that a history is singular if the scale factor is within an interval @xmath106 $ ] , where @xmath107 is a fiducial value , which can be arbitrarily small .",

    "<S> recently it has been claimed that the wheeler - dewitt quantization of gravity is unable to avoid cosmological singularities . however , in order to make this assertion , one must specify the underlying interpretation of quantum mechanics which has been adopted . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , several nonsingular models were obtained in wheeler - dewitt quantum cosmology in the framework of the de broglie - bohm quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , there are specific situations where the singularity can not be avoided in the framework of the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics . in these specific situations , </S>",
    "<S> the matter content is described by a scalar field , and the wheeler - dewitt equation looks - like a klein - gordon equation . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is to study the wheeler - dewitt quantization of cosmological models where the matter content is described by an hydrodynamical perfect fluid , where the wheeler - dewitt equation reduces to a genuine schrdinger equation . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the conclusions of the consistent histories and the de broglie - bohm approaches coincide in the quantum cosmological models where the curvature of the spatial sections is not positive definite , namely , that the cosmological singularities are eliminated . in the case of positive spatial curvature , </S>",
    "<S> the family of histories is no longer consistent and no conclusion can be given in this framework . </S>"
