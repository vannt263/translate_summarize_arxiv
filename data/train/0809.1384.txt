    "high - mass stars predominantly form in clustered environments much more distant than typical well - investigated low - mass star - forming regions .",
    "thus , high spatial resolution is a prerequisite for making progress in the observational study of high - mass star formation .",
    "furthermore , all pre - main sequence phases are usually deeply embedded .",
    "this often forces observers of embedded massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) to move to the mid - infrared ( mir ) where the resolution of conventional imaging is limited to @xmath1 025 even with 8-m class telescopes .",
    "hence , one traces linear scales still several hundred au in size even for the nearest mysos , and conclusions on the geometry of the innermost circumstellar material remain ambiguous .",
    "mir emission moderately resolved with single telescopes may even arise from the inner outflow cones . + a versatile method to overcome",
    "the diffraction limit of single telescopes is to employ interferometric techniques .",
    "we are conducting a larger survey toward mysos based on mir interferometry . in total , we have observed 10 sources so far .",
    "all these sources , mostly comprising bn - type objects @xcite , are clearly resolved with the interferometer baselines we applied ( @xmath2 m ) .",
    "this in itself is a major step forward compared to the previous more or less unresolved thermal infrared imaging with 4- to 8-m class telescopes for these sources .",
    "visibilities in the mid - infrared wavelength range 813@xmath3 m have been obtained with the instrument midi @xcite at the very large telescope interferometer . within the framework of guaranteed time observations for midi as well as director s discretionary time",
    ", we observed our objects at several 8.2-m unit telescope ( ut ) baseline length / baseline orientation combinations between june 2004 and may 2006 .",
    "additionally , first observations with the 1.8-m auxiliary telescopes ( ats ) have been performed in autumn 2006 and spring 2007 for three of our sources .",
    "+ we refer to for a more detailed description of the standard observing procedure for midi observations . for all our observations ,",
    "the so - called highsens mode was used : during self - fringe tracking , all the incoming thermal infrared signal is used for beam combination and fringe tracking , while the photometry is subsequently obtained in separate observations .",
    "we use the midi prism as the dispersing element , hence , we finally get spectrally dispersed visibilities with a spectral resolution of @xmath4 .",
    "hd 169916 was used as the main interferometric and photometric standard star ( procyon in the case of the orion bn object ) and was observed always immediately after the science objects . in addition , all calibrator measurements of a night were collected to create an average interferometric transfer function and to assign error margins to the measured visibilities .",
    "we have reduced the interferometric data with the mia+ews package , version 1.5 , developed at the mpia heidelberg and the university of leiden . +",
    "one way to interpret visibilities is to use a combination of simple geometrical configurations like gaussians , disks , rings , or point sources to construct a synthetic intensity distribution similar to the observed one .",
    "still , to learn more about the potentially more complicated intensity structure , such an ansatz might not always be sufficient .",
    "further , more physically motivated modelling is often necessary for interpretation .",
    "+ we apply self - consistent continuum radiative transfer modelling in order to produce synthetic mir intensity maps and to compare their spatial frequency spectrum with the observed visibilities . here , we are mainly concerned with the question which spatial distribution of the circumstellar material can account for both , the sed and the visibilities of our targets .",
    "+ we used the sed online fitting tool of robitaille et al .",
    "@xcite that can in principle comprise yso models including an envelope plus circumstellar disk .",
    "we refer to this publication for details on the setup of these models . for parameter combinations well fitting",
    "the sed , the underlying radiative transfer code of whitney et al .",
    "@xcite is then used to produce high - resolution mir intensity maps for these selected models .",
    "comparing the resulting synthetic visibilities with the observed ones indicates which models finally account for the observed sed _ and _ visibilities .",
    "in this contribution , we concentrate on two objects for which we have reached considerable progress .",
    "they show visibilities in the order of 0.20.3 at ut baselines .",
    "we note that such visibilities , although not reaching the relatively high levels of most herbig ae / be stars , are qualitatively different from the very low visibilities ( 0.010.05 ) found for several of the other objects in our sample as well as recently reported for two other massive ysos @xcite .",
    "this is a prominent bn - type myso at a distance of roughly 1.5 kpc . although m8e - ir was a well investigated object in the 1980 s , the spatial resolution for most of the ir observations of m8e - ir was poor .",
    "an exception is the work by @xcite who speculated on the existence of a small circumstellar disk around m8e - ir based on thermal infrared lunar occultation data .        for sed fitting",
    ", we use the m8e - ir photometric data collected in @xcite plus new 1.2 mm data from .",
    "we want to stress that no ( sub-)millimeter interferometry on m8e - ir is reported in the literature which could spatially disentangle the flux contributions from m8e - ir and the radio source 8@xmath5 away .",
    "hence , we consider the m8e - ir fluxes for @xmath6 m just as upper limits in our modelling . furthermore , we include new optical photometry in the b , v , and i filters reported by as well as our new subaru 24.5 @xmath3 m photometry .",
    "in addition , the 813 @xmath3 m total flux spectrum taken in the course of the midi measurements was used to further constrain the multitude of viable models .",
    "we show the sed of the best fitting model in fig .",
    "[ fig : m8eir ] ( left ) .",
    "+ the best - fit model comprises a very compact circumstellar disk ( @xmath0 50 au ) , a larger envelope with small bipolar cavities , and a cool central object ( @xmath7 4500 k ) .",
    "we mention explicitly , that among the well - fitting models there are also configurations without a disk ( axisymmetric flattened envelope + outflow cavities only ) , but also including a cool bloated central star .",
    "these nevertheless give almost the same high visibilities .",
    "this suggests that in the case of m8e  ir , the choice of the central object might actually govern the resulting visibility levels ( see below ) .",
    "+ traditionally , such bn - type objects have been modelled as a spherical dust shell surrounding a hot , non  bloated central star @xcite . to check if even such canonical configurations can account for the sed and the visibilities we employed well - tested models , based on the code used in @xcite . with a purely spherically symmetric geometry and a 24,000 k central star it is possible to find models that reasonably fit the sed of m8e - ir . still , compared to the measured visibilities , these models result in far too low visibilities ( @xmath0 0.05 ) for m8e - ir in the baseline range 3060 m over the whole 813 @xmath3 m range .",
    "the error margins of the midi visibilities ( on average 10% ) do not account for such large differences . in fig .",
    "[ fig : m8eir ] ( right ) , as an example the _ u , v_-spectrum of the 12 @xmath3 m synthetic images based on the cool star models are included as black solid and blue dashed line .",
    "they are compared to the corresponding image from the above - mentioned spherically symmetric modelling with hot central star ( red dotted line ) .",
    "although the _ u , v_-spectra of the models with cool central object still show somewhat lower visibilities than the measured ones , obviously they are qualitatively different from the spherically symmetric model with hot central star which fails to match the observational data .",
    "+ the best - fitting models for m8e - ir in the robitaille model grid feature central stars of 1015 m@xmath8 which are strongly bloated ( 120150 r@xmath8 ) and , therefore , have relatively low effective temperatures . such solutions can occur since the robitaille grid comprises the full range of canonical pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks from the geneva group as possible parametrisation of the central objects .",
    "m8e - ir probably can not straightforwardly be identified with correspondingly very early evolutionary stages , and we refer to @xcite for an extensive discussion on the intricate dependencies in the model grid",
    ". however , the tendency for a bloated central star in the case of m8e - ir may be valid . as demonstrated already in , accretion with high rates onto main sequence stars can temporarily puff up such stars .",
    "further encouragement to consider this comes from recent modelling of the pre - main - sequence evolution of stars in dependence of the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "these groups find that for accretion rates ( onto the forming star ) reaching 10@xmath9m@xmath8/yr , the protostellar radius can temporarily increase to @xmath10r@xmath8 , in accordance with our indirect findings from the model fitting .",
    "interestingly , @xcite revealed high - velocity molecular outflows from m8e - ir based on m - band co absorption spectra and speculated on recent ( @xmath11 yr ) fu ori - type outbursts for this object . if these multiple outflow components really trace recent strong accretion events , the central star could have indeed been affected .",
    "in addition , m8e - ir is not detected by cm observations with medium sensitivity .",
    "this could be explained by large accretion rates still quenching a forming hypercompact hii region @xcite .",
    "furthermore , also a bloated central star with @xmath12 k would give a natural explanation for these findings .      in order to give another example for the abilities of mir interferometry to assess the viability of different geometric models for a massive yso",
    ", we report here on results for the object m17",
    "irs1 @xcite , also called the kleinman - wright ( kw ) object .",
    "we have obtained three visibility measurements with different position angles for ut baselines from 43  m to 56  m. furthermore , for the first time , we show here midi observations towards massive ysos utilising the 1.8-m ats .",
    "we find clearly different visibility levels for the five measurements , staying at a 0.10.3 level for the ut measurement but reaching more than 0.5 for the shorter at baselines . also here , we consulted the robitaille sed fitter in order to find models reproducing the sed .",
    "since the sed of m17 irs1 is less constrained in the literature than in the case of m8e - ir , the fitter allows for a larger variety of models , all however including an intermediate - sized circumstellar disk and only a very small envelope contribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kwo ] ( left ) we show one example where the 32-m at measurement is compared to 9 well - fitting models . here , midi can be used as a discriminator . among the sed - fitting models it rejects very strongly inclined ( 87@xmath13 ) edge - on models where we see relatively diffuse mir emission only , since the view onto the central compact disk rim",
    "is obstructed by the outer disk .",
    "consequently , such models result in far too low n - band visibilities and do _ not _ reach the measured elevated visibility levels for any baseline orientation . the less inclined 75@xmath13 model to the right at least provides a direct view onto the inner hot disk rim and therefore results in clearly higher visibilities than edge - on models .",

    "the total disk size is not well constrained by the models , and the data allow also for an envelope - only configuration .",
