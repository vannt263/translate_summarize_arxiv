    "compton backscattering ( cbs ) of laser light against relativistic electron could be a promising method to obtain polarized monochromatic @xmath0 rays with small divergence angle .",
    "this idea was pointed out by milburn @xcite , arutyunian and tumanian @xcite for the first time in 1963 .    among @xmath0-ray producing techniques , cbs method possesses several significant advantages @xcite .",
    "first , compton scattering is well understood within qed framework , and there are definite relations among energy , emitting angle , cross section , polarization , etc . of the scattered photons .",
    "second , the scattered photons has a sharp cut - off near the maximum energy and the largest fraction of photons is in the high energy region .",
    "third , cbs @xmath0-rays based on relativistic e@xmath4 have a very small divergence angle , that allows experiments with both compact targets and detectors .",
    "fourth , cbs method provides a convenient and swift way to steer the polarization of @xmath0-rays by changing polarization of injected laser beams .    the first @xmath0-ray facility based on cbs method , the ladon beam , started to operate in 1978 @xcite .",
    "till now , there are several @xmath0-ray facilities all over the world @xcite .",
    "most of them produce @xmath0-ray from several hundred mev to several gev .",
    "also , there are a few mev @xmath0-ray facilities : hi@xmath0s@xcite on duke storage ring , bl05ss@xcite on spring-8 storage ring and bl-1@xcite on newsubaru .    the future shanghai synchrotron radiation facility ( ssrf ) @xcite provides precious opportunity to build a @xmath0 source of high quality .",
    "recently , shanghai laser electron gamma source ( slegs ) , a @xmath0-ray beam line based on cbs method has been proposed . in the coming sections , basic relations of cbs method will be described briefly , the proposed slegs facility and @xmath0-ray it generated will be illustrated and compared with other cbs @xmath0-ray facilities of ten mev order .",
    "laboratory frame , b@xmath5 electron rest frame , and c@xmath5 feynman diagram of compton scattering.,width=340 ]    compton scattering between e@xmath6 and photon can be described within qed framework@xcite .",
    "the kinematics of cbs in laboratory ( lab ) frame a ) , electron rest ( er ) frame b ) , and related feynman diagram c ) is shown as fig.[bcs ] .",
    "energy of cbs @xmath0 photon @xmath7 is related to the emitting angle @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the energy of incident e@xmath4 , @xmath11 the relativistic factor , @xmath12 mev mass of e@xmath4 at rest and @xmath13 the energy of incident laser photon . in case of relativistic e@xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , formula([elabtheta ] ) can be simplified as : @xmath16 which indicates that the maximum energy of cbs photon is proportional to @xmath17 approximately",
    ".    the angular differential cross - section of cbs @xmath0-rays in er frame follows klein - nishina formula@xcite .",
    "the angular differential cross - section in lab frame can be derived by lorentz transformation . in case of relativistic e@xmath4 , the angular divergence of cbs @xmath0-rays in lab frame",
    "is in order of 1/@xmath0 .",
    "when injected laser beam is totally polarized , the degree of polarization of cbs @xmath0 photons has a clear relationship with the scattering angle@xcite .",
    "the ideal flux @xmath18 of cbs @xmath0 rays is related to the impact geometry and spatial densities of electron and laser beams .",
    "the spatial density of electrons is treated as product of gaussian distributions , the corresponding widths are determined by beam qualities and twiss functions of the storage ring@xcite .",
    "the spatial density of laser is also treated as product of gaussian distributions , the corresponding widths are determined by optics of gaussian beams@xcite .    in a typical head - on setup ,",
    "the ideal flux of cbs @xmath0 rays is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the laser power , @xmath21 the current of e@xmath4 beam , and @xmath22 the luminosity : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the total compton cross section , @xmath25 the transversal dimension of laser , @xmath26 the horizontal and vertical width of the e@xmath6 bunch respectively .",
    "one should notice that the actual luminosity @xmath27 is significantly affected by geometrical restriction of both injected laser beam and extracted @xmath0 beam , this is limited by vacuum tube dimensions of the storage ring .",
    "henceforth , we applied proper selection on ideal cbs events during the mote - carlo simulation .",
    "a schematic view of future slegs facility is illustrated as fig.[system ] .",
    "laser beam of operating wavelength is generated and polarized in the optical chamber , then focused and injected into ssrf storage ring from front - end downstream to the selected sector , i.e. , the interaction region by a thin mirror .",
    "the operating laser is aligned to the electron beam by a co - axis visible laser .",
    "once laser beam overlaps e@xmath4 bunches , compton backscattering occurs between relativistic electron and laser photon , @xmath0-ray with determined energy and a narrow divergence angle is generated , transported and then extracted from the inject front - end . after the rear - end upstream to the interaction region , remaining laser light is inspected by a set of monitors which provides feedback and control signals as well .",
    "ssrf , now under construction , will operate by year 2009",
    ". it will be a high performance third - generation synchrotron facility producing high brightness x - ray covering an energy range from 0.1kev to 40kev@xcite .",
    "it consists of an 100mev linac , an 100mev to 3.5gev booster , a 3.5gev storage ring and associated experimental stations .",
    "the storage ring has 4 identical long straight sectors , 16 identical standard straight sectors , and 40 bending magnets@xcite .",
    "its designed features are listed in table.[t : ssrf - features ] .",
    ".designed features of ssrf storage ring .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^,<,^ , < \" , ]     compared with those facilities , slegs has several unique properties .",
    "first of all , slegs is expected to achieve flux of non - collimated @xmath0-ray up to @xmath28 s@xmath3 using a commercial cw co@xmath1 laser of 100w order output power .",
    "the high brightness @xmath0-ray will be a powerful probe to meet requirements of many experimental researches .",
    "second , since ssrf storage ring has a proper energy to generate @xmath0-ray of 10mev order by co@xmath1 laser , slegs does not have to use a complicated far infrared ( fir ) laser system like bl05ss on spring-8 , so that issues of relatively - low output power , transmission and focusing for operating laser can be avoided .",
    "last , hi@xmath0s possesses unique preponderance of the tunable @xmath29 by using a tunable free electron laser ( fel ) .",
    "however , one of the key issues hi@xmath0s has to handle is the synchronization between fel pulses and target electron bunches . while slegs will avoid such an issue since the operating laser will run under a cw mode .    to meet the potential requirements of @xmath29 lower than 22mev ,",
    "an oblique injection setup for co@xmath1 laser is within our scope .",
    "if the impact angle between laser and electron beam is changeable , one can obtain @xmath0-ray with determined maximum energy .",
    "however , such a setup will definitely cause a decreased @xmath0-ray flux , thus method like external laser resonator @xcite is necessary to enforce power of the operating co@xmath1 laser .",
    "in this paper , slegs , a @xmath0-ray beam line based on backward compton scattering was suggested .",
    "slegs is expected to achieve a flux of non - collimated @xmath0-ray up to @xmath2 s@xmath3 by employing a cw mode commercial co@xmath1 laser of 100w order output power .",
    "the maximum energy of @xmath0-ray is about 22mev .",
