    "focus is a heavy - flavor photoproduction experiment located at the wide band photon area of fermilab . an upgraded version of its predecessor e687@xcite , focus is composed of ( fig.[fig : spec ] ) a @xmath0strip silicon detector , a large acceptance magnetic spectrometer with mwpc , cherenkov differential counters , muon detectors , hadron calorimetry , and both forward ( inner em ) , and large angle ( outer em ) electromagnetic calorimetry .",
    "the topics in charm physics that are being investigated include lifetimes , semileptonic decays , charm baryons , charm spectroscopy , searches for @xmath1 mixing and for rare and forbidden decays , charmonium production and radiative decays , and charm meson and baryon decays with neutrals .",
    "the experiment was designed starting in 1981 ; in 1985 there was the first test beam of the completed spectrometer ; in 1987 the first e687 data - taking period , interrupted by a fire .",
    "the spectrometer was seriously damaged , but quickly repaired . in 1990 - 1991 the second e687 data taking took place . in 1995 the e687 spectrometer became focus and underwent upgrades , with the outer em calorimeter being equipped with a new plane of square scintillator tiles .",
    "the 1996 - 1997 focus data - taking period met the goal of collecting ten times the e687 statistics of reconstructed charm decays , by fully reconstructing more than ten million charm particle decays .",
    "the outer em calorimeter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oe]a ) is located @xmath2 from the target .",
    "its external dimensions are @xmath3 , with an internal rectangular aperture @xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to an angular acceptance for photons @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "a vertical gap , set at @xmath7 for the 1996 - 97 run , avoids showers from the most abundant background process , i.e. , bethe - heitler @xmath8 pair production .",
    "the outer em is required to reconstruct @xmath9-initiated showers from charm radiative and @xmath10 decays in the energy range @xmath11 and to perform @xmath12 identification for charm semielectronic decays in the momentum range @xmath13 , thus extending the cherenkov counter identification , which is limited to @xmath14 .",
    "some @xmath15 identification power is expected to help identify low - momentum muons in charm semimuonic decays .",
    "typical geometrical acceptances range from 30% for electrons and muons in charm meson semileptonic decays , and 40 - 50% for decays with one or more @xmath10 in the final state , including the case of shared @xmath10 ( one @xmath9 in the inner and one in the outer em calorimeter ) .",
    "the outer em calorimeter is made of pb plates ( stiffened with a 6% sb by weight ) and scintillator layers ( popop , @xmath16 doped with 8% naphtalene , and ne-102 were used ) , for a total of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( tab.[tab : oez ] ) .",
    "scintillator layers are made of strips , whose light readout is either individual ( oe0 , oe9 segments ) or five - fold integrated by a light guide to a single pm ( all other segments ) , for a total of 1136 readout channels .",
    "each counter in the calorimeter is individually wrapped in @xmath19 al foils and black plastic .",
    "horizontal and vertical five - fold counters are interlaced as shown in fig.[fig : oe ]  b ) .",
    "the counters are arranged in nine independent views along z ( z is the beam direction ) , and four independent quadrants in the ( x , y ) plane . a module of s - z strips @xmath20 performs horizontal - vertical matching of clusters .",
    "the counters are equipped with ten - stage , emi-9902 kb photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) operating at a typical gain of @xmath21 at @xmath22 , with a quantum efficiency of @xmath23 at @xmath24 , which were individually tested in order to select only those with good linearity and small sensitivity to rate effect@xcite .",
    "the pmt s are powered by lecroy 1440 and custom - made framm@xcite hv systems , via a high - linearity , anode grounded voltage divider supplying @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "the pmt signals reach the counting room via @xmath27 long coaxial cables , where they are converted by a lecroy 1881 m fastbus adc , with a @xmath28 conversion .",
    "the outer em calorimeter can be displaced both horizontally and vertically for calibration and access purposes .",
    ".longitudinal segmentation and counter geometry of the outer em calorimeter .",
    "[ tab : oez ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a scintillator tile array module recovers showers in the small - angle , high - occupancy region , improves horizontal - vertical matching , and cleans the @xmath10 peak by rejecting fake matches . the module is located at shower max , i.e. , between the oe1 and oe2 modules , and is composed of an array of 100 supertiles , and edge counters to flag laterally noncontained showers .",
    "each supertile is made of two @xmath29 tiles ( bicron bc404-b scintillator ) , each is equipped with two 20  cm - long , 1-mm - diameter wavelength shifting ( wls ) optical fibers ( kuraray y11 multiclad s - type ) 20  cm - long , @xmath30-cut , with all four ends thermally spliced to 2  m - long clear fibers following the cdf endplug splicing technique @xcite , with a heat - shrinking tube to protect the splice .",
    "the eight ends of the clear fibers of each supertile are optically coupled by means of optical grease to a emi-9902 kb pmt .",
    "r5 cm    each tile is wrapped in white teflon tape , and the side is painted with white reflective paint by bicron . the tile array is enclosed in a light - tight al case .",
    "the light transmission efficiency of the thermal splice was measured on relevant samples during the splicing process and shown to be typically 94% .",
    "beam halo muons were used to determine the counter geometry , for an approximate pmt gain balancing ( @xmath31 ) , to determine the light attenuation curves inside strips ( fig.[fig : mips ] ) , and the equalization constants .",
    "the light output was measured in the laboratory with cosmic rays to be 30 photoelectrons / mip for a supertile , and 100 photoelectrons / mip for a five - fold counter at @xmath32 from pmt .",
    "the relative width fwhm of the energy distribution for a mip is 40% for a supertile , and 30% for a five - fold counter .",
    "the reconstruction algorithm begins with the identification of clustered energy deposits .",
    "clusters of energy deposits associated with the projection of charged tracks reconstructed in the magnetic spectrometer are tagged .",
    "the reconstruction of neutral showers uses the remaining clusters .",
    "energy deposits ( in adc counts units ) for each counter are multiplied by the mip equalization constants , and then summed up to determine the detected energy associated to each cluster .",
    "pairs of clusters in the two orthogonal x - y views of each oe segment are formed using the energy balance as a criterium , after proper weighing for light attenuation inside the strip counters .",
    "neutral showers are formed by aligned x - y pairs in the different oe segments .",
    "the diagonal counters and the tiles are used to resolve ambiguities . the use of tile array information improves the efficiency of x - y matching in the small angle region ( fig.[fig : bucotile]a ) by reducing the number of fake matches ( fig.[fig : bucotile]b ) .",
    "the coordinates of the shower centroids are determined considering the energy deposited in each counter of the x - y pairs .",
    "once corrected for systematic effects (   6 ) , the shower centroids determine the photon incidence point .",
    "the @xmath10 invariant mass is computed by the measurement of relative angle and energy of the decay photons .",
    "when computing the invariant mass of higher states with one or more @xmath10 in the final state , the @xmath10 invariant mass is fixed at its nominal rest value , and the photon momenta are rearranged by means of a 1-c fit . the classical algorithm in ref.@xcite",
    "was modified in order to take into account space resolution@xcite .",
    "neutral showers are identified as em or hadronic by means of the discriminant analysis algorithm (   7 ) .",
    "finally , the sum of energy clusters longitudinally forming a reconstructed photon track gives the detected energy @xmath33 .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency for single isolated showers was measured using primary bethe - heitler @xmath8 pairs .",
    "the @xmath8 tracks found in the proportional chambers were projected onto the oe front .",
    "shower reconstruction was then performed using all the available clusters . the efficiency for reconstructing the shower associated with the electron or positron track was greater than 95% over the range @xmath34 , and better than 90% over the range @xmath35 .",
    "the response of the calorimeter to photon- and electron - initiated e.m .",
    "showers , the scale factor @xmath30 between detected energy and incident energy , and the energy resolution have been studied using a geant simulation .",
    "simulation predictions have been verified with @xmath8 pairs and electron beam in calibration runs , @xmath8 pairs from the process @xmath36 of photon conversion in physics events for electron - initiated showers constants , and @xmath10 peaks for photon - initiated showers constants and absolute calibration of the energy scale .",
    "the detected energy is parametrized as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the particle incident energy and @xmath33 is the particle energy deposited in the calorimeter active layers .",
    "energy linearity and resolution are shown in fig.[fig : riso ] , in agreement with the simulation predictions .",
    "the photon impact point @xmath39 is determined from the em shower center - of - gravity @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the counter width , after applying the standard correction@xcite @xmath42 after correction , we determine the space resolution as from @xmath8 calibration events ( fig.[fig : spazio ] ) to be @xmath43 in the energy range @xmath44 .",
    "the outer em calorimeter extends the @xmath12 rejection beyond the cherenkov momentum range , i.e. , from 6 to 20 gev / c .",
    "the identification algorithms have been developed in the framework of the discriminant analysis@xcite , which allows one to distinguish between two or more groups of events . as first step ,",
    "we determine a set of @xmath45 variables @xmath46 _ ( discriminant variables ) _ , significantly different among the m groups of events @xmath47 to be distinguished ( fig.[fig : pielmu ] ) .    a typical set of variables is composed of the ratio @xmath48 between the energy measured by the calorimeter and the track momentum by the tracking system , the lateral and longitudinal shower development pattern , the cluster centroid residuals and widths .",
    "next , the _ score _ function @xmath49 is built , and we find coefficients @xmath50 which maximize separation among the @xmath51 , thus applying one cut on @xmath52 ( fig.[fig : da]a ) . as training samples of known membership we used @xmath8 bethe - heitler pairs embedded in hadronic events , pions from @xmath53 decays , and muons from dedicated runs with beamdump .",
    "the overall pion residual contamination obtained for an @xmath54 electron efficiency is @xmath55 , while the pion residual contamination is @xmath56 for 85% muon efficiency ( fig.[fig : da]b ) .",
    "efficiency for muons from @xmath57 decay , and rejection of pions compared with the outer muon detector performances are shown in fig.[fig : phys ]  a , b ) .",
    "the calorimeter stability is controlled by monitoring the adc pedestals between spills , the pmt hv supplies , and the single - channel rough response by a @xmath58 laser light source@xcite .",
    "the availability of a muon beam halo over the entire area of the outer em allows muon calibrations to be performed regularly . the long - term , fine - grained run - dependent stability is given by exploiting physical signals in events , namely    1 .",

    "electron and @xmath10 signals in hadronic events ( fig.[fig : stabi ]  b , a ) can track the shifts in detector response up to a stability of @xmath61 over the entire 18-month data - taking period .",
    "work is in progress to study process ( 3 ) ( fig.[fig : stabi ]  c ) , which will provide on an event - by - event basis the photon energy calibration constant , electron and positron e / p , and a check of the stability of the measurement of p , as performed by the magnetic spectrometer .",
    "clean signals of the decays of charm mesons and baryons in many channels have been obtained by using the outer em electron and muon identification and the @xmath10 reconstruction ( fig.[fig : phys ] ) .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of the outer em for electrons and muons from semileptonic charm decays is about 30% , extending especially in the low - momentum region @xmath62 .",
    "the detection of charm semileptonic decays with the electron momentum in the acceptance of the outer em is of particular interest in view of the possibility of determining the @xmath63 dependence for the formfactors ( see , eg , ref.@xcite for an updated review ) .",
    "studies performed in e687 include the cabibbo - suppressed semileptonic decay @xmath64 ( ref.@xcite ) .",

    "the contribution of the outer em is effective especially in the low momentum region ( fig.[fig : phys]b ) , as measured on pions from @xmath65 decays .",
    "numerous charm decays have been found with @xmath10 s reconstructed by the outer em ( fig.[fig : phys]c - m ) .",
    "thanks to the large statistics and low level of background , precision measurements such as the isospin mass splittings @xmath66 of excited charm meson states have been initiated .",
