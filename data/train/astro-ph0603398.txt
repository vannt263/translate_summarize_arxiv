    "5 we obtain a more precise boundary of the dynamical stability @xmath162 .",

    "10a and 10b , where different regions are represented in the planes @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "it is important to stress the coincidence of boundaries between dynamically and thermodynamically stable and unstable configurations at large temperatures . using approximate criteria of dynamical stability we can not definitely judge if these boundaries coincide exactly or there is a small difference between them ,",
    "however the behavior of specific binding energy @xmath115 let us enough confidence in this result .",
    "analysis of models with @xmath132 approaching @xmath170 , when maximal densities are expected , had shown that they have a very extended halo so , even at very high densities , the cluster could remain to be dynamically stable with local newtonian properties .",
    "similar situation should appear when taking into account of degeneracy ( merafina & ruffini 1990 ) . in the newtonian limit , only nonrelativistic degeneracy is expected , so the situation is not changed qualitatively . the logarithmic curve @xmath11 for a fully degenerate",
    "nonrelativistic gas is a monotonic line @xmath171 , like in a polytropic star with index @xmath172 and @xmath173 , which does not show neither thermodynamical nor dynamical instabilities .",
    "the thermodynamical instabilities on the curve @xmath130 appear only at finite temperatures .",
    "consideration of fully degenerate ultrarelativistic particles with equation of state @xmath127 , made by chavanis ( 2002b ) , has sense only for a limited box because these configurations are dynamically unstable with an open outer boundary .",
    "the curve @xmath125 for a given size of the box gives results about the onset of dynamical instability in such configurations and has an analogy with the corresponding curve at constant @xmath12 .",
    "in the problem of stellar stability the curve @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the specific entropy of an isentropic star , is used in the static criterion and its maximum determines the boundary of dynamical stability of a star ( zeldovich 1963 ) .",
    "the curve @xmath11 at constant  entropy \" was also used for an approximate estimation of the boundary of dynamical stability of truncated stellar cluster ( bisnovatyi - kogan et al .",
    "1993 ) , but such approach is very cumbersome . using the same curve at constant @xmath132 or @xmath12 is much easier and give very close results .",
    "it happens however , that at large values of @xmath176 or at large enough @xmath177 , the curve @xmath11 is not valid anymore for the estimation of the dynamical stability .",
    "the corresponding curve at constant @xmath132 becomes discontinuous and irrelevant . using the curve @xmath125 instead of @xmath11 permits to make such estimation in all range of values of the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we have obtained numerically that at @xmath178 maxima of the curves @xmath125 and @xmath11 coincide exactly but , at larger @xmath12 , maximum of the curve @xmath11 disappears while the maximum of the curve @xmath125 is remaining and shifting to infinite central density at @xmath179 .",
    "so that all models at larger @xmath12 are dynamically stable .",
    "similar relation between @xmath125 and @xmath11 takes place for the curves at constant @xmath10 . at large values of @xmath180 maxima of these curves",
    "coincide and the curves themselves tend to an asymptotic behavior ( see figs .  2 and 4 ) . at smaller temperatures",
    "the maximum of @xmath125 is shifting to larger densities ( see fig .  4 ) and maximum of @xmath11 moves in the opposite side of smaller densities . following lynden - bell & wood ( 1968 ) we accept that loss of thermodynamical stability is connected with the maximum of the curve @xmath113 .",
    "the visible similarity between the oscillations of the curve @xmath125 for relativistic clusters and the newtonian isothermal stellar cluster in the box may have a different physical nature : in the first case there are two types of oscillations , reflecting the loss of dynamical and thermodynamical stability , while the cluster in the box is dynamically stable and oscillations are connected only with the onset of thermodynamical instability leading to gravothermal catastrophe .",
    "the analogy between the open cluster with a cutoff in the maxwellian energy distribution function and an isothermal cluster in a box is not complete because the first one is thermodynamically unstable everywhere while the second one is only after the antonov s point , at density contrast @xmath181 .",
    "nevertheless , both kinds of oscillations are present in the structure of relativistic clusters with a cutoff when we consider clusters with different cutoff parameter @xmath132 and a variable value @xmath12 , which plays the role of the ratio @xmath98 ( density contrast ) or @xmath96 for the cluster in a box .",
    "the figs .",
    "4 and 5 illustrate the behavior of both oscillations for the function @xmath125 , where oscillations of the curves at constant @xmath10 add thermodynamically unstable modes and oscillations of the curves at constant @xmath12 give a picture of the dynamical stability of the cluster .",
    "calculations show that newtonian truncated clusters lose their thermodynamical stability at @xmath182 , very close to the value @xmath110 for clusters in a box .",
    "we have obtained that only the curve @xmath125 at constant @xmath10 is valid for the estimation of thermodynamical stability , while the corresponding curve @xmath11 may be misleading . in the case of dynamical stability",
    "both curves give identical results at lower values of @xmath178 while , at larger ones , only the curve @xmath125 may be used .",
