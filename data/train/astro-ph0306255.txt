    "radio emission from cosmic ray air showers has been predicted in the 60 s  @xcite . in the subsequent decade ,",
    "several experiments have asserted the observation of such emission  @xcite . for this period , following the review of allan  @xcite , different mechanisms of electromagnetic pulse generation have been identified , such as negative charge excess ( 10 - 25% ) in the shower . for our purpose ,",
    "calculations of the electromagnetic pulse were performed within a simple model considering only this negative charge excess contribution .",
    "the resulting electric field can be expressed as : @xmath0    with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 the distance between the moving charges of the shower and the observation point .",
    "for the numerical simulation , we have assumed a charge excess distribution @xmath4 along the shower axis with @xmath5 charges at the maximum for a 100 eev ehecr and no spatial shower extension .",
    "the corresponding electric fields for 3 different impact parameters @xmath6 in a vertical shower configuration are shown on fig.1 .    _ ]    _ ]    these electric fields are strong enough to be measured .",
    "it is worth noting that the pulse width increases with the impact parameter .",
    "thus , a complete knowledge of the pulse waveform enables to determine the charge profile of the shower and consequently the energy of the primary ehecr . due to the large frequency content of the fourier spectrum ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , broadband antennas are requested for the most accurate pulse shape determination .",
    "it is also possible , by an appropriate narrow - band frequency filter , to use stand - alone triggered antennas .",
    "moreover , using at least 3 antennas in time coincidence enable to reconstruct the shower direction .",
    "these considerations motivated us to implement a demonstrative experiment , named codalema , at the radio observatory of nanay  @xcite ( france ) .",
    "codalema uses 6 large frequency bandwidth antennas ( 1 - 100 mhz ) in time coincidence .",
    "the experimental central array ( 83 m x 87 m ) consists of the corner antennas of the rseau dcamtrique de nanay ( rdn ) and a narrow - filtered antenna ( 33 - 65 mhz ) used as a trigger . one additional antenna linked by optical fiber",
    "is located 1 km east from the central array ( see fig .",
    "the data acquisition system is based on 3 lecroy digital oscilloscopes ( 1 gs / s ) which record the amplified antenna voltage signal .",
    "our first task has been to identify the various sources of background , mainly the radio broadcasting stations .",
    "bandpass filters ( 24 - 82 mhz ) suppress the am and fm bands .",
    "additional anthropic noise comes from the acquisition room s air - conditioning and the computing network hub : these effects have been filtered out . within these precautions",
    "we have reached a trigger rate of 12 events / hour for a 40 @xmath7v triggering antenna signal ; among them 85% have been already identified as noise pulses .",
    "a typical 6 antennas coincidence signal , triggered by the dedicated narrow filtered antenna of the central array is shown fig .",
    "4 . after a preliminary analysis of time delays",
    ", we can assert that such an event is not compatible with identified sources of noise and can be considered as a possible candidate for cosmic ray air shower radio emission .",
    "codalema has been now recording data at a duty cycle of 100% since mid - march 2003 , and until the end of 2003 .",
