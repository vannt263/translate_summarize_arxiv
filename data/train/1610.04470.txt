    "a dozen years ago , it was shown that introducing the 1918 hemagglutinin ( ha ) confers enhanced pathogenicity in mice to recent human viruses that are otherwise non - pathogenic in this host . moreover , like the 1918 one , these recombinant viruses infect the entire lung and induce high levels of macrophage - derived chemokines and cytokines , which results in infiltration of inflammatory cells and severe haemorrhage  @xcite . in macaques ,",
    "the whole 1918 virus causes a highly pathogenic respiratory infection that culminates in acute respiratory distress and a fatal outcome  @xcite . although the 1918 polymerase genes were found essential for optimal virulence , replacing the 1918 ha by a contemporary human one proved enough for abolishing the lethal outcome of the 1918 virus infection in mices  @xcite , further underlining the key role of the 1918 ha in the deadly process .",
    "the first 1918 ha sequences were obtained in 1999 from formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded lung tissue samples prepared during the autopsy of victims of the influenza pandemic , as well as from a frozen sample obtained by _ in situ _ biopsy of the lung of a victim buried in permafrost since 1918  @xcite .    since then , the number of ha sequences determined each year has grown dramatically , jumping from @xmath0100 in the nineties to @xmath03,000 per year nowadays  .",
    "the goal of the present work is to take advantage of this wealth of data for identifying features that are unique to the 1918 sequence , the underlying hypothesis being that they may prove responsible for the unique behaviour of viruses displaying the 1918 ha .     -0.3",

    "multiple pairwise sequence alignment was performed using blast  @xcite , version 2.2.19 , taking as a reference the long h1 sequence from virus a / thailand / cu - mv10/2010 .",
    "mview  @xcite , version 1.60.1 , was used for converting the blast output into a standard multiple sequence alignement ( msa ) . in this msa , 3365 different amino - acid residues",
    "are observed at least 20 times , that is , 6.2 per position along the sequence , on average  . since 1999 , a dozen 1918 ha sequences have been determined , at least partially .",
    "they differ , at most , by a couple of mutations  @xcite .",
    "one of them was chosen as a representative , namely , the sequence found in pdb structure 4eef ( with h3 subtype residue numbering )  @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : idoft ] , known ha sequences   of post-1919 viruses are _ all _ less than 95% identical to the 1918 one , that is , complete ones differ from the 1918 sequence by at least 25 amino - acid substitutions  .",
    "strinkingly , after 1919 , ha sequences of human viruses are less than 91.4% identical to the 1918 ha , a @xmath090% level of sequence identity being observed in the thirties as well as more recently , though in a few instances only  . on the other hand , ha sequences of avian viruses more than 93% identical to the",
    "1918 ha have been observed each year since 2005 , suggesting that a selection pressure favoring 1918 ha - like sequences is at work in avian species , in line with the hypothesis of an avian origin for the 1918 - 1919 pandemic  @xcite .",
    "moreover , among the 41 post-1950 sequences that are more than 93% identical to the 1918 ha , 35 ( 85% ) come from duck species  , further pinpointing aquatic birds as a possible reservoir  @xcite .",
    "._number of post-1919 hemagglutinin sequences with same residue as the 1918 sequence .",
    "_ top : residues found in less than 50 human h1 sequences .",

    "bold : residue index of an highly conserved residue , that is , a residue found in more than 95% of the h1 sequences . @xmath1h3 subtype residue numbering ; @xmath2ha1 subunit ; @xmath3ha2 subunit .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     however , the 1918 ha sequence is a singular one .",
    "for instance , 17 amino - acid residues in this sequence are found in less than 1% of other human h1 sequences .",
    "the ten less frequent ones are shown on top of table  [ tbl : mutations ] .",
    "most of them are frequent in avian h1 sequences , or often found   in sequences of other ha subtypes ( last column ) .    as a striking exception , after 1919 , gly 188 has _ not _ been observed again in human h1 sequences .",
    "it has also _ not _ been observed in avian ones . as a matter of fact",
    ", it has only been observed in 47 h1 sequences , all of them from swine , a single time in 2003 , once each year between 2009 and 2012 , and several times each year since then  . in human ha of other subtypes , it has been observed 11 times , in sequences from h3n2 or h5n1 viruses . since 1919 , gly 188 has _ only _ been observed 82 times , the first time in 2000 , in the sequence of an avian h9 ha .",
    "residue 188 is located at the n - terminus of the `` 190-helix '' , which is involved in the ha receptor binding site , but it does not interact directly with the receptor  @xcite .",
    "three residues are usually observed at this position , namely , serine ( 41% ) , isoleucine ( 33% ) and threonine ( 21% ) .",
    "interestingly , proline which , like glycine , can have a direct impact on the secondary structure  @xcite , the folding  @xcite or the stability  @xcite of a protein , is also rarely observed  .",
    "this suggests that , taken alone , gly 188 is likely to be deleterious .",
    "however , since the 1918 virus proved efficient , one or several compensatory mutations have to be present in its ha sequence .",
    "* why has this mutation been overlooked ? * after 1919 , gly 188 has _ not _ been found again in human h1 sequences .",
    "overall , it has been found in _ only _ 0.2% of all known ha sequences .",
    "the reason why this singular mutation seems to have been overlooked is probably the following one : in the eleven 1918 - 1919 ha sequences known so far , gly 188 has been found ten times . in other words , there is an exception , namely , the ha sequence of virus a / london/1/1918  @xcite .",
    "* how may it be involved in the deadly process ? * gly 188 is located between his 183 and asp 190 , two key residues of the receptor binding site ( figure  [ fig : hook ] ) .",
    "his 183 is highly conserved , being found in 99.9% of h1 sequences .",
    "it is thus likely to be involved in the specific recognition of the sialic acid moiety of the ha receptor . on the other hand",
    ", asp 190 is well conserved in h1 ha ( 88% ) but much less in all ha ( 56% ) , being frequently replaced by glu ( 32% ) .",
    "this suggests that it is involved in more subtle aspects of the recognition .",
    "indeed , a d190e mutation in the 1918 ha results in a preference for the @xmath4 sialic acid ( avian ) receptor  @xcite .",
    "thus , given the inherent flexibility of gly residues , introducing gly at position 188 may allow for alternative orientations of asp 190 and , as a consequence , for the recognition of other conformations of the sialic acid moiety , or to sialic acid moities linked to di - saccharides other than gal - glcnac . though a glycan microarray analysis confirmed a specific recognition of @xmath5 sialic acid receptors by 1918 ha , with no binding when glcnac is absent  @xcite , a change in its repertoire of ha receptors could indeed explain why the 1918 virus proved so deadly .",
    "gly 188 has rarely been observed in ha sequences ( table  [ tbl : mutations ] ) .",
    "since it is located within a key motif of the ha receptor binding site ( figure  [ fig : hook ] ) , this mutation may have an impact on receptor recognition and specificity .",
    "this , in turn , could explain why the 1918 ha confers enhanced pathogenicity .",
    "it is thus important to check the effects of this mutation on receptor function .",
    "meanwhile , it may prove important to monitor this mutation , noteworthy in swine viruses since it has been observed in swine h1 sequences each year since 2009 .",
