    "od the work by @xcite deserves a special mention , because it shows that ad and od differ in manifestation and origin .",

    "but , a continuous endeavor to find various aspects of ad and od in networks ( e.g. , chimera death @xcite ) , new systems ( e.g. , ecological system @xcite ) , and new coupling schemes ( e.g. , amplitude dependent coupling @xcite ) indicates the necessity and urgency of further research in this field .    in the previous studies on oscillation suppression , all the variables of a coupled oscillators under study show either od or ad , separately , for a certain parametric condition .",
    "under no condition it happens that different variables of a same system show different oscillation suppression states . and",
    "@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) show either od or ad : under no coupling condition it happens that the two variables show two different oscillation suppression states for any parameter value .",
    "] this is owing to the fact that either the inverse hopf bifurcation ( that leads to ad ) or a symmetry breaking bifurcation ( that leads to od ) occur to all the variables of a system at a time .    at this point",
    "we ask the following open question : * _ is it possible that different variables of a system ( of coupled oscillators ) show different types of oscillation suppression states under an identical parametric condition _ * ? in this paper we indeed identify this type of _ mixed mode oscillation suppression states _ in the paradigmatic lorenz system and lorenz - like system under several generic coupling configurations , which were earlier studied in the context of ad and od .    in the present paper",
    "we report two _ mixed mode oscillation suppression states _ :",
    "( i ) the _ mixed mode death _ ( mmd ) state , where , under a similar parametric condition , a set of variables of a coupled oscillator system show od , whereas the rest of the variables of the same coupled system show the ad state . in the chaotic lorenz system under two different coupling schemes , namely the direct - indirect @xcite and mean - field coupling @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "we show that , while two of the variables ( say , @xmath2 and @xmath0 ) show the od state , the rest ( i.e. , the @xmath3 variable ) shows an ad state .",
    "thus , unlike the ad or od state , this mmd state is a _ variable selective mixture _ of stable ihss ( i.e. , od ) and stable hss ( i.e , ad ) .",
    "( ii ) in the second mixed death state , a nontrivial bistable ad ( nad ) state ( occurs in @xmath2 and @xmath0 variables ) and a monostable ad state ( occurs in the @xmath3 variable ) appear simultaneously  we refer this state as the mnad state ( i.e. , mixture of the nad and ad state ) .",
    "we identify that the symmetry of the system plays an important role behind the birth of the mmd and mnad states : while the _ reflection symmetry breaking _ is responsible for the mnad state , the _ breaking of both reflection and translational symmetries _ are responsible for the mmd state . through a rigorous bifurcation analysis",
    ", we establish the occurrence of the mmd and mnad states and several transition routes associated with them . to establish the generality of our results we verify all the results in a lorenz - like system , namely the chaotic chen system @xcite .",
    "_ to the best of our knowledge , existence of the mmd and mnad states and the corresponding transitions associated with them have not been observed earlier for any other system or coupling configuration_. finally , we support our results through an electronic experiment that provides the _ first _ experimental evidence of the mmd and mnad states .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following manner : the next section considers the identical lorenz systems under two different coupling schemes .",

    "at first , we consider two identical chaotic lorenz oscillators @xcite interacting directly through diffusive coupling and indirectly through a common environment @xmath4 , which is modeled as a damped dynamical system @xcite . the mathematical model of the coupled system is given by    [ evlsys ] @xmath5    here @xmath6 is the diffusive coupling strength , and @xmath7 is the environmental coupling strength that controls the mutual interaction between the systems and environment .",

    "this coupling scheme was proposed by @xcite as a general scheme to introduce ad in any coupled oscillators .",
    "although ref .",
    "@xcite studied the response of a lorenz system under this coupling scheme , but it could not identify the od state ; only ad was reported there .",
    "later the present authors @xcite reported that this coupling scheme can also gives rise to od and ad - od transitions in nonlinear oscillators .",
    "thus , it is a generic coupling scheme to introduce ad and od . here , in the following , we investigate the effect of this coupling scheme in inducing the mixed mode oscillation suppression states in the lorenz system .",
    "equation  ( [ evlsys ] ) has a trivial homogeneous steady state ( hss ) , which is the origin @xmath10 , and additionally two more coupling dependent nontrivial fixed points given by :    \\(i ) @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
