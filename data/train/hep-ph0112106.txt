    "<S> , we investigated the phase structure and the chiral meson masses at the critical point from qcd in the improved ladder approximation . using the variational approach , we calculated the effective potential at finite temperature and chemical potential . in the chiral limit , we found the mixed phase that consists of a low density chirally broken phase and a high density chirally symmetric phase when @xmath0 is sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> for explicit chiral symmetry breaking case , the critical point was found at @xmath76 mev , @xmath77 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath78 seems to be too large in light of the experiments at rhic and lhc . by including strange quark mass , </S>",
    "<S> however , it would be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> the meson masses was obtained from the curvature at the minimum of the effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> we found that @xmath66 almost goes to zero at the critical point while @xmath67 remains nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> the result is consistent with that obtained within the framework of the linear sigma model in the mean - field approximation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also confirmed that @xmath22 at the tricritical point behaves as @xmath79 our results can be understood by the landau - ginzburg effective potential and partly support the experimental signature proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    finally , some comments are in order . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we did not take into account the screening of the gluon , that is to say , the debye screening for the electric gluons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been shown that at finite temperature the wave function renormalization makes non - negligible contribution to the critical line and the behavior of the order parameter@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they may affect the precise location of the critical point although the main feature of this work might not change . </S>",
    "<S> in any case , it is preferable to take into account the screening of the gluon , wave function renormalization and the effects of @xmath80 quark in the future work . </S>"
