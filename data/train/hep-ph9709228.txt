    "consider charm created in a high - energy nuclear collision .",
    "some 99% of the charmed quarks created in hadronic collisions are _ not _ to be found in @xmath0 bound states , but rather in the open charm continuum .",
    "much like their bound counterparts , the unbound charmed quarks are created early , move through the interaction region slowly , and react strongly with their environment .",
    "they should contain as much information about the collision region as the @xmath1 , although this information may be harder to extract .",
    "assuming invariance of the collision kinematics under longitudinal boosts @xcite , a space - time picture shows that a charmed quark , created near @xmath2 ( the initial nucleus  nucleus collision ) , moves according to @xmath3 which is exactly a longitudinal streamline of the fluid . thus there is not much information to be gained from the quark s eventual longitudinal momentum",
    "; it is to the transverse momentum that we turn in order to learn about the quark s interaction with the surrounding matter .",
    "the quark is created in the nascent plasma and , assuming it is not created too near the edge , sees this plasma cool to the mixed phase and beyond , to the hadron gas which dissociates soon after .",
    "the mixed phase lasts a long time , typically ten times as long as the pure plasma which precedes it .",
    "our calculation thus concentrates on the charmed quark s interaction with the mixed phase @xcite .",
    "we track the quark s diffusion through the initial plasma , its hadronization upon emerging into the hadron phase , its collisions ( as a @xmath4 meson ) with pions , and its possible reabsorption by a plasma droplet . for a given initial transverse momentum",
    ", we calculate the distribution of the final @xmath5 of the @xmath4 meson .",
    "( for details of the following see @xcite . )",
    "our simulation of the mixed phase is based on the cascade hydrodynamics code of bertsch , gong , and mclerran @xcite . at proper time @xmath6 ,",
    "the uniform plasma breaks up into droplets of radius @xmath7  or  @xmath8  fm ( a parameter of which we have little knowledge ) .",
    "each droplet has a mass equal to its volume times the stefan - boltzmann energy density at the transition temperature , @xmath9 , and its temperature is fixed at @xmath10 .",
    "each droplet then radiates pions as a black body . at each pion emission ,",
    "the droplet shrinks ( to conserve energy ) and recoils ( to conserve momentum ) .",
    "similarly , a droplet absorbs any pion that comes close enough , with the concomitant growth and recoil .",
    "pion collisions are included in the simulation as well .",
    "the dominant motion of the droplet ",
    "pion mixture is a rarefaction due to the longitudinal expansion imposed by the initial conditions .",
    "this leads to the eventual evaporation of the droplets .",
    "a charmed quark is created inside the plasma at @xmath11 and is allowed to diffuse according to a langevin process @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a gaussian noise variable .",
    "the plasma cools as @xmath14 until it reaches @xmath10 , whereupon it breaks into droplets .",
    "( we make sure the quark is _ inside _ a droplet . )",
    "the quark continues to diffuse . if the quark hits the surface of a droplet , it stretches a flux tube out into the vacuum .",
    "this flux tube has a tension @xmath15 and a fission rate ( per unit length ) @xmath16  to  @xmath17 .",
    "( this is the range of values used in string - based event generator programs . )",
    "if the flux tube breaks in time , then the @xmath18 quark finds itself to be a @xmath4 meson outside the droplet ; otherwise it is reflected back into the droplet .",
    "if the quark indeed hadronizes , it is tracked as a @xmath4 meson in the pion gas .",
    "if this @xmath4 meson hits a droplet , it is absorbed : the light quark gets stripped off and the @xmath18 quark proceeds back into the plasma",
    ".    very often , a @xmath18 quark coming to the surface of its droplet has insufficient energy to emerge as a meson .",
    "( it needs about 350  mev . ) in that case the quark is _",
    "trapped_. unless it gains energy through diffusion or through droplet recoil , it will remain trapped until the droplet evaporates away much later .",
    "note the very weak dependence on the initial momentum .",
    "this feature , together with the width of the final - momentum distribution , indicates that the @xmath4 meson is _",
    "thermalized_. the mean thermal @xmath5 of a @xmath4 meson at @xmath19  mev is 820  mev , and we attribute the higher @xmath20 shown in the figure to the flow of the droplet fluid .    in interpreting our results we distinguish between two populations of charmed quarks , those that emerge from flux - tube fission and",
    "then escape the system_fragmentation mesons_and those that are trapped within their original droplets until the latter evaporate_breakup mesons_.              1 .",
    "the mean @xmath5 of a @xmath4 meson is almost independent of the initial @xmath5 of the parent @xmath18 quark .",
    "2 .   many @xmath18 quarks ( 40%  80% ) are trapped until the droplets evaporate , and come to equilibrium at the transition temperature .",
    "other @xmath4 mesons come close to equilibrium in the plasma and in the pion gas , and in any case decouple shortly after the transition is complete .",
    "recapture by the droplets ( which we havent discussed ) is an important effect , affecting the equilibration of 10%  40% of the particles .",
    "the distribution of @xmath4 momenta is roughly thermal , but the mean momentum is above the thermal average because of transverse flow . presumably the latter may be gauged by the momentum distributions of the lighter species .",
    "everything considered , the @xmath5 of the @xmath4 mesons does provide a rough thermometer of the phase transition .",
