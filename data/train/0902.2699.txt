    "electronic structure calculations for solids are commonly based on solving self - consistently a single - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "the solutions have the form of bloch waves , i.e. , they are translation symmetry adapted .",
    "first principles calculations of this form are successfully performed at present within density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite or hartree - fock ( hf)@xcite approaches supplemented by post - hf calculations .",
    "a particular object of interest in these studies is the correct treatment of electron interactions in crystals with relatively weak as well as strong electron correlations . within the framework of dft electron correlation effects",
    "are incorporated in practice through various exchange - correlation functionals , whereas diverse post - hf correlation algorithms have been designed to address this issue with the wave - function - based approach @xcite .",
    "dft is strictly speaking a ground - state theory .",
    "nevertheless the eigenvalues of the kohn - sham ( ks ) equations have been interpreted as the electronic energy bands .",
    "recent theoretical and computational studies on molecular systems have shown that in analogy with koopmans theorem in hf theory , the absolute values of the energies of the ks ( spin- ) orbitals can be indeed interpreted as approximate vertical ionization potentials @xcite .",
    "for the highest occupied ks orbital , this relation becomes exact @xcite .",
    "yet , the calculated ionization potentials depend on the approximation to the exact ks potential .",
    "the description of the electronic properties of many elemental metals and various covalent and ionic compounds by means of dft has appeared to be very successful .",
    "recent extensions of the theory to the time - dependent domain , time - dependent dft and current dft @xcite , have also allowed for a more rigorous treatment of optical excitations . by circumventing the calculation of the many - body wave function , ground or excited state ,",
    "dft offers a relatively simple approach to the electronic structure of solids .",
    "such studies are commonly carried out within the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known , however , that the lda - dft and gga - dft based calculations underestimate the band gaps of insulators and semiconductors .",
    "it is also known , that this failure is only partially related to the use of approximate exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "what a more complete determination of energy gaps does require is an exchange - correlation potential which is orbital dependent . the polarization and relaxation cloud around an extra electron placed into the conduction bands or a hole created in the valence bands is of different nature than that of the electrons in the ground state of the solid ; see , e.  g. , @xcite .",
    "the addition or removal of an electron to or from the _ infinite _ system leaves the electron density unchanged and therefore , the exchange - correlation potential in lda - dft , which depends on the local densities only , can not describe properly the correlation hole of the extra charge @xcite .",
    "an accurate description of the correlation hole of the extra particle is crucial for determining the band gap in crystals and sets thus the limitations of lda - dft .",
    "naturally , various improvements have been suggested such as the optimized effective potential method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , that allows for the use of orbital - dependent functionals in dft .",
    "orbital - dependent functionals were initially introduced within the exact exchange ks approach @xcite .",
    "alternatively , use can be made of green s functions techniques , among which the most exploited is the _ gw _ approximation @xcite . yet",
    ", the most enduring problem with the ks approach is that no systematic way has been developed to improve the functionals .",
    "presently , advanced quantum chemical wave - function - based methods can address the electron correlation problem at levels of high accuracy in small and medium - size molecular systems .",
    "these calculations work usually with virtual excitations of electrons out of molecular orbitals .",
    "extending the application of wave - function - based methods to solids is not straightforward since the delocalized nature of the bloch orbitals would require the consideration of an infinite number of orbitals in order to incorporate the relevant electron correlations .",
    "needless to say , an _ ab initio _ calculation of the many - electron wave function based on bloch orbitals scales quite unfavorably with the size of the system . for infinite systems we are concerned with ,",
    "a relevant issue is to properly account for the translational symmetry while constructing the crystal many - electron wave function @xcite . despite the associated complexity",
    ", wave - function - based algorithms have been developed by several groups and applied to a series of semiconducting and insulating solid - state compounds .",
    "the electron correlation problem is addressed in these schemes either by second - order mller - plesset theory ( mp2 ) @xcite or coupled - electron - pair and coupled cluster methods @xcite . by realizing that the correlation hole of an added electron or hole is a local object , use can be made of local operators @xcite .",
    "the latter are most naturally associated with a set of real - space , localized wannier orbitals ( wo s ) .",
    "localized orbitals are usually obtained by applying various localization schemes to the canonical bloch orbitals of the self - consistent - field ( scf ) ground - state wave function @xcite .",
    "most often , such algorithms are based on orbital localization procedures @xcite which were developed in order to facilitate correlation treatments in finite systems .",
    "the foster - boys localization criterion @xcite was successfully integrated in localization schemes for the canonical bloch orbitals of periodic systems in several groups , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "localized orbital sets are extensively exploited in local correlation methods for solids @xcite .",
    "a local approach to the computation of inter - atomic and intra - atomic correlations has been suggested by stollhoff and fulde @xcite .",
    "their formalism is based on a physically motivated selection of the relevant two - particle excitations by subdividing the orbital space into appropriate local orbital domains .",
    "this idea has been elaborated later on by pulay and saeb@xmath1 , who developed correlated methods such as local mller - plesset perturbation theory of second and higher ( up to fourth ) order without triple excitations and local coupled - electron - pair schemes @xcite .",
    "these local correlation approaches make use of a _ a priori _ division of the virtual orbital space into relevant subspaces , i.e. , excitation domains .",
    "although developed initially for molecular systems , the local orbital schemes of pulay and saeb@xmath1 have been also adopted for crystalline compounds ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "most recently , the local mp2 correlation approach of pisani _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has been proposed , which employs linear scaling techniques in order to facilitate the correlation calculation .",
    "this formalism was applied to the ground - state properties of various tetrahedral semiconductors . a local correlation method which can handle successfully excited - state properties of solids and",
    "goes beyond the perturbational schemes is the local hamiltonian approach ( lha ) @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of the local hamiltonian for the electron - addition and electron - removal quasiparticle states are computed in this approach by means of coupled - cluster or multiconfiguration and multireference configuration interaction calculations @xcite when the correlations are strong .",
    "the quasiparticle energy bands are then expressed in terms of those matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the computational effort in the correlation calculation can be drastically reduced by using the method of increments @xcite , designed initially to express the ground - state correlation energy as a fast convergent series of correlation contributions assigned to selected groups of localized orbitals .",
    "the incremental scheme has also become a valuable tool in constructing the scattering operator which is related to the ground - state wave function in a cumulant formulation of the many - body problem @xcite .",
    "the lha has been applied to the determination of the correlation - induced corrections to the band structures of covalent semiconductors and insulators @xcite , polymers @xcite , model beryllium and hydrogen chains @xcite , and ionic insulators @xcite .",
    "extensive use of the incremental scheme was made for the accurate determination of the correlation contributions to the excited state properties of diamond and silicon @xcite .",
    "the starting point in our lha is a ground - state periodic hf calculation .",
    "it provides a set of canonical bloch orbitals which are then subject to an orbital localization procedure that yields optimally localized wannier orbitals ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches were introduced by shukla _",

    "@xcite , who carried out the ground - state hf calculation in real rather than reciprocal space and obtained directly localized orbitals .",
    "_ ab initio _ many - body green s function methods have also been devised to compute the energy bands of periodic systems @xcite .",
    "a local description of the correlation hole around an added electron or hole is utilized in some of these formalisms too @xcite .",
    "one of the key advantages of such schemes is the fact that the self - energy operator is first evaluated exploiting local orbital sets and then transformed to a momentum representation .",
    "in addition , the use of local orbitals prompts to employing the method of increments for the evaluation of the self - energy operator ; see , e.  g. , @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of the wave - function - based methods is the use of well defined and controllable approximations ; see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "they are amenable to systematic improvements that guarantee converged results for quantities such as binding energies and energy bands @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we extend the application of the wave - function - based local hamiltonian approach to cubic zinc - blende bn ( c - bn ) . due to its peculiar mechanical and physical properties , i.e. , high bulk modulus , high thermal conductivity , and low dielectric constant , c - bn is a material of considerable technological interest @xcite .",
