    "observations that inherit a direction occur in many scientific disciplines .",
    "for example , directional data arise naturally in the biomedical field for protein structure , cell - cycle , and circadian clock experiments @xcite .",
    "further examples occur in statistical mechanics , where experiments containing only rod - shaped particles can develop complex directional ordering @xcite .",
    "a simple pattern change for rod shaped objects is the density - dependent , order - disorder phase transition @xcite shown for macroscopic granular rod experiments @xcite in fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) .",
    "quantification of this transition relies on a principle component analysis ( pca ) type measure that is linked with statistical mechanical theories @xcite .",
    "when applied to experimental samples whose rod orientations shift from uniform to unidirectional , this measure finds the dominant direction ( director ) and strength of rod ordering ( order parameter ) .    in reality , however , experimental rod orientations are rarely unidirectional , and spatial distortions in the director field frequently occur .",
    "these distortions may result from fluctuations and/or other competing forces , like those exerted by the container boundaries in fig .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) . accurately quantifying rod orientations can",
    ", in fact , yield information about the collective behavior of rods , for example elastic properties @xcite .",
    "while accurate orientation measurements of molecular - sized rods require special techniques @xcite , recent advances in single molecule detection may make such measurements more widely accessible @xcite .",
    "for example , `` labeled '' rods can be inserted into various environments and serve as local directional sensors by aligning with the rod - shaped material around them .",
    "this technique can in principle be used in environments as complicated as a cell @xcite and potentially uncover intricate patterns that require more sophisticated measures of directional order .    the resulting complex patterning may reduce the value of the order parameter , sometimes to the point that the sample is inaccurately classified as disordered , fig .",
    "to predict which multidirectional patterns cause such misclassifications , we merge directional statistics with frame theory .",
    "frames have proven useful in fields like spherical codes , compressed sensing , signal processing , and wavelet analysis @xcite .",
    "a frame is a basis - like system that spans a vector space but allows for linear dependency , which can be used to reduce noise , find sparse representations , or obtain other desirable features unavailable with orthonormal bases .",
    "tight frames even provide a parseval type formula similar to orthonormal bases .",
    "moreover , the frame concept has recently been generalized to probability distributions on the unit sphere @xcite .    to analyze granular rod patterning",
    ", we consider statistical testing for directional uniformity , focusing on the bingham test .",
    "we characterize non - uniform sample distributions that lead to failure of rejection and find that these distributions are probabilistic tight frames . since these frames are well - understood in terms of algebraic / geometric conditions @xcite , further synergistic effects may develop between directional statistics and frame theory .",
    "common tests in directional statistics focus on whether or not a sample on the unit sphere @xmath0 is uniformly distributed . here",
    ", we concentrate on two elementary tests for uniformity , _ rayleigh _ and _ bingham_. given a discrete sample @xmath1 , we follow the textbook @xcite and define the _ mean _ as @xmath2 where the polar representation @xmath3 splits the mean into a _",
    "mean direction _ @xmath4 and a _ mean resultant length _ @xmath5 . the _ rayleigh test _ rejects the hypothesis of uniformity if @xmath6 is large .",
    "more precisely , the asymptotic large - sample distribution of @xmath7 under uniformity is @xmath8 distributed with an error @xmath9 , while the modified rayleigh statistic @xmath10 is @xmath8 distributed with an error @xmath11 @xcite .    to describe the _",
    "bingham test _ , let @xmath12 denote the uniform probability measure on the sphere with respect to the borel sigma algebra @xmath13 .",
    "we first observe that the second moments of @xmath12 satisfy @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "note that the _ fisher ( or scatter ) matrix _ , @xmath17 of a sample @xmath1 equals the matrix of second moments of the underlying counting measure . recalling that the matrix of second moments of the uniform measure equals @xmath18 , the _",
    "bingham test _ rejects the hypothesis of directional uniformity of a sample if its fisher matrix @xmath19 is far from @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , the bingham statistic @xmath20 under uniformity is @xmath21 distributed with an error @xmath9 , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we say that the bingham test is inconsistent when rejection of uniformity fails for a particular non - uniform sample distribution . here",
    ", we focus on those distributions that are multi - modal , where a _ mode _ is a local maximum of the distribution s density .",
    "other analysis tools have been customized to spherical and more general manifold data in @xcite .",
    "a collection of points @xmath22 is called a _ finite frame for @xmath23 _ if there are two constants @xmath24 , called _ lower and upper frame bounds _ ,",
    "respectively , such that @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the usual inner product on @xmath23 .",
    "a frame spans @xmath23 , and any finite spanning set is a frame @xcite . a collection of points @xmath22",
    "is called a _ finite tight frame for @xmath23 _ if there is a positive constant @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 every finite tight frame gives rise to the expansion @xmath29 which generalizes the parseval formula for othonormal bases @xcite .",
    "we define a _ finite unit norm tight frame ( fntf ) _ for @xmath23 as a tight frame whose elements all have unit norm . according to @xcite , the tight frame bound @xmath27 of a fntf is @xmath30 .",
    "the collection @xmath1 is a fntf iff its fisher matrix equals @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the literature contains many fntfs .",
    "for example , @xcite shows a fntf for @xmath31 composed of @xmath32 vectors , and @xmath33 is a fntf for @xmath34 iff @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "in fact , any set of @xmath36 unit norm vectors in @xmath23 can be converted to a fntf by adding @xmath37 extra vectors @xcite .",
    "we recall probabilistic frames as introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the collection of probability measures on the sphere with respect to the borel sigma algebra @xmath13 .",
    "an element @xmath39 is called a _",
    "probabilistic unit norm frame for @xmath23 _ if there are constants @xmath24 such that @xmath40 if we can choose @xmath41 in , then we call @xmath42 a _ probabilistic unit norm tight frame for @xmath23 _ , and @xmath27 must be equal to @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "we then have @xmath44 where the integral is vector valued .",
    "this generalizes , and a sequence of pairwise distinct vectors @xmath1 is a fntf for @xmath23 iff the normalized counting measure @xmath45 is a probabilistic unit norm tight frame for @xmath23 .",
    "as introduced in section [ section : directional statistics ] , the rayleigh test rejects uniformity if the mean resultant length is far from @xmath46 , while the bingham test rejects uniformity if the sample s fisher matrix is far from @xmath18 .",
    "we therefore call a probability measure @xmath42 on the sphere a _ rayleigh_-alternative if its mean @xmath47 is @xmath46 and a _",
    "bingham_-alternative if @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "we first characterize rayleigh- and bingham - alternatives in terms of maximizers and minimizers , respectively , of certain potentials .",
    "subsequently , we provide a connection to probabilistic frames .",
    "bjoerck verifies in @xcite that , among all probability measures @xmath39 , the maximizers of the _",
    "probabilistic riesz-@xmath50-potential _",
    "@xmath51 are exactly the zero mean probability measures .",
    "therefore , the maximizers of are the rayleigh - alternatives .    to characterize bingham - alternatives , we introduce the _ directional force _",
    "@xmath52 between two points @xmath53 and @xmath54 on the sphere @xmath55 as @xmath56 the physical potential between @xmath53 and @xmath54 is @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the minimizers of the _ probabilistic frame potential _",
    "@xmath58 among all probability measures @xmath39 , are said to be in _ equilibrium under the directional force _ , or simply in _ directional equilibrium _",
    "naturally , the uniform distribution is in directional equilibrium @xcite ; however , other distributions with a mixture of well - defined modes can also be in directional equilibrium .",
    "in fact , the minimizers of the directional potential are exactly those probability measures @xmath39 whose second moments satisfy @xmath59 @xcite and are , therefore , the bingham - alternatives .",
    "these minimizers were characterized as the probabilistic unit norm tight frames for @xmath23 in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the latter characterization is that tight frames are well - understood in terms of algebraic as well as geometric conditions @xcite .",
    "results in @xcite and the present work imply that the bingham - alternatives with zero mean are the minimizers of the _ fractional frame - riesz-@xmath50-potential _",
    "@xmath60 hence , probabilistic unit norm tight frames with zero mean are both , rayleigh- and bingham - alternatives .",
    "a collection of rod shaped particles can undergo an order - disorder phase transition that , in the simplest model , is controlled by entropy . at low rod densities , the maximal total entropy occurs when both rotational and translational entropies are independently maximized . beyond a critical density ,",
    "however , rotational entropy is sacrificed for significant gains in translational entropy , resulting in a phase transition from randomly ( uniformly ) rotated rods , fig .",
    "1(a ) , to directionally oriented rods , fig .",
    "a pca - type method measures the average rod direction ( director ) and strength of rod alignment ( order parameter ) that results from rotational entropy loss and is described in the following : let @xmath61 denote the direction of the @xmath62-th rod out of @xmath63 total rods",
    ". for simplicity , let us assume that the alignment is measured in a plane , hence @xmath64 .",
    "the covariance type matrix @xmath65 is therefore used to determine the director .",
    "since @xmath66 is symmetric , the eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis , where the nonnegative eigenvalue @xmath67 corresponds to the order parameter and the associated eigenvector corresponds to the director , cf .  @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath68 and the second eigenvalue of @xmath66 equals @xmath69 . this pca - type method only measures unidirectional rod ordering . in experiments , however , fluctuations and/or competing forces like container boundaries , figs .  1(c ) and 1(d ) , can influence rod alignment .",
    "therefore , the director field can vary spatially , potentially resulting in complex multidirectional patterning , fig .",
