    "quantum entanglement is a vital resource for the field of quantum information sciences @xcite . in a noisy environment",
    ", it is important to consider possible degradation due to decoherence of any initially prepared entanglement .",
    "recently , yu and eberly @xcite investigated the dynamics of two - qubit entanglement under various types of decoherence .",
    "they found that the decay of a single qubit coherence can be slower than the decay of qubit entanglement .",
    "the abrupt disappearance of entanglement at a finite time was named ",
    "entanglement sudden death \" ( esd ) .",
    "clearly , such finite - time disentanglement can seriously affect applications of entangled states in quantum information processing .",
    "the initial report of esd in two - qubit entangled states in a specific model was later explored in wider contexts and in higher dimensions of hilbert space when the qubits are replaced by qutrits or qudits @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidences for this effect have been reported for optical setups @xcite and atomic ensembles @xcite .    for qubit - qubit and qubit - qutrit systems peres - horodecki criterion",
    "divides the set of quantum states into entangled and separable states @xcite .",
    "however for higher dimensional bipartite systems such characterization is not easy @xcite . nevertheless , bipartite entangled states can be divided into free - entangled states and bound - entangled states @xcite .",
    "free - entangled states can be distilled under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) whereas bound - entangled states can not be distilled to pure - state entanglement no matter how much copies are available . bound entanglement itself",
    "can not be used for quantum information processing , however it may activate teleportation fidelity @xcite .",
    "bound entanglement manifests the irreversibility in asymptotic manipulation of entanglement @xcite .",
    "bound - entanglement constructed by purely mathematical arguments have existence in physical processes @xcite .",
    "recently , it was proposed that free - entangled states may be converted to bound - entangled states in the presence of local decoherence @xcite . in particular , it was shown that certain free entangled states of qutrit - qutrit systems become non - distillable in a finite time under the influence of local decoherence .",
    "such behavior has been named as distillability sudden death ( dsd ) .",
    "we have found that the calculations done in @xcite are not correct .",
    "nevertheless , the main idea is still working , i.e. , there are certain free - entangled quantum states which dynamically convert to bound - entangled states .",
    "we have rectified the equation of motion for the physical system and pointed out the possible cause of confusion .",
    "in addition , we have studied this problem for more general decoherence , i.e. , when the qutrit - qutrit system is subjected to both collective and multi - local noises .",
    "we have found that distillability sudden death may occur under multi - local and global decoherence .",
    "however , if qutrit - qutrit states are subjected only to collective noise then there are certain states which never undergo distillability sudden death and entanglement sudden death .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss the physical model and the basic equation of motion along with its solution .",

    "our physical model consists of two qutrits ( two - three level atoms for example ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 that are coupled to a noisy environment both singly and collectively as shown in figure [ fig : model ] .",

    "the stochastic magnetic fields refer to statistically independent classical markov processes satisfying the conditions @xmath6 with @xmath7 as ensemble time average , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the phase - damping rates for multi - local and collective decoherence , respectively .",
    "let @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 be the first excited state , second excited , and ground state of the qutrit , respectively .",
    "we choose the basis @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the time - dependent density matrix for two - qutrit system is obtained by taking ensemble average over the three noise fields , i.e. , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the dynamics of density matrix can be given by operator sum representation @xcite as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are kraus operators @xcite that preserve the positivity and unit trace conditions , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "the most general solution of @xmath28 interacting with global ( multi - local + collective ) decoherence under the assumption that the system is not initially correlated with any of the three environments is given as @xmath29 where the terms describing the interaction with the local magnetic fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",

    "we can concentrate on the dynamics only for multi - local decoherence by turning off the collective magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath57 in eq .",

    "we point out here that eq .",
    "( @xmath58 ) of @xcite is not correct as the authors studied the case of multi - local noise ( with @xmath57 ) and defined the general solution as @xmath59 ( compare it with eq .",

    "this summation contain four terms instead of nine .",
    "they missed the matrices @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "it is quite straight forward to show that with @xmath70 and @xmath71 defined in @xcite , the partial transpose of isotropic states always contain one negative eigenvalue and the conclusions that isotropic states always exhibit entanglement sudden death would not be correct .",
    "however , the conclusions of ref.@xcite are correct and we assume that ann - jaeger only wrote the wrong matrices but worked with correct ones . the proof of this assumption",
    "can be found in ref.@xcite , where again ann - jaeger wrote wrong operators in their section @xmath72 , however they provide the correct matrix as eq .",
    "( @xmath72 ) of ref.@xcite , which validates their conclusions .",
    "however , such confusion should be rectified for broader interest of readers .",
    "in fact , the matrices @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath60 for a qutrit were used by ann - jaeger in their study of entanglement sudden death in qubit - qutrit systems @xcite . song _",
    "etal_. , @xcite probably have taken the results of ref.@xcite and discovered the very interesting feature of distillability sudden death for qutrit - qutrit systems . as a result of this confusion , eq .",
    "( @xmath75 ) of ref.@xcite is wrong .",
    "however , as we demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] that some of their conclusions still survive , in particular , free - entangled states undergo distillability sudden death .",
    "however , the local unitary transformation can not avoid distillability sudden death .",
    "before demonstrating the possibility of distillability sudden death , we discuss the characterization of bound - entangled states .",
    "it was proved @xcite that bound - entangled states have positive partial transpose ( ppt ) and hence non - distillable under locc .",
    "there is not a unique criterion to detect bound - entangled states . even for qutrit - qutrit system",
    ", there are various bound - entangled states and a single criterion is not capable to detect all of them ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , one can use the realignment criterion @xcite to detect certain bound - entangled states .",
    "the realignment of a given density matrix is obtained as @xmath76 . for a separable state @xmath77",
    ", realignment criterion implies that @xmath78 . for a ppt - state",
    ", the positive value of the quantity @xmath79 can prove the bound - entangled state .",
    "let us consider a particular initial state given as @xmath80 where @xmath81 , the separable states @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , and @xmath84 a maximally entangled state .",
    "it was shown @xcite that @xmath85 is separable for @xmath86 , bound - entangled for @xmath87 , and free - entangled for @xmath88 . it was claimed @xcite that the partial transpose of time - dependent eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - be ] ) in the range @xmath88 always has a negative eigenvalue in finite time .",
    "we have already mentioned that this claim is a result of an incorrect equation of motion .",
    "the fact is that the possible negative eigenvalues of partial transpose of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - be ] ) are given as @xmath89 these eigenvalues obviously become positive at a finite time .",
    "it can be observed that if we turn off the multi - local fields and turn on only collective interaction , then these states always has a negative value , which implies no entanglement sudden death and no distillability sudden death .",
    "however , in the presence of global decoherence or multi - local decoherence , entanglement sudden death and distillability sudden death may happen as we demonstrate below",
    ".    the negativity @xcite for this state can be easily calculated as @xmath90 + \\max[0,-\\lambda_2 ] + \\max[0 , - \\lambda_3]\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : n - hbe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the negativity @xmath91 is plotted for various values of @xmath92 in figure [ fig : n - hbe ] , where we have taken @xmath93 for ease . figure [ fig : n - hbe ] shows that except for @xmath94 , the negativity becomes zero at finite times leading to a ppt state which might be entangled .",
    "the state with @xmath94 becomes ppt only at infinity , which is definitely a separable state .",
    "let us now demonstrate that the time evolved density matrix @xmath95 do undergo distillability sudden death .",
    "this could be most easily demonstrated by checking entanglement of @xmath95 after it becomes ppt .",
    "this relation is plotted in figure [ fig : dsd - hbe1 ] , which shows that under global decoherence an initial free - entangled state becomes bound - entangled at a time @xmath96 .",
    "the entanglement of ppt - state is verified by the positive value of @xmath97 in the range @xmath98",
    ". however , the realignment criterion fails to detect the possible entanglement after time @xmath99 . to conclude the separability or entanglement after this time",
    ", one could extract three ",
    "@xmath100  density matrices spanned by @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 from @xmath95 and check their properties @xcite .",
    "we could turn off the collective field , i.e. , @xmath57 and observe the distillability sudden death under multi - local decoherence .",
    "figure [ fig : dsd - hbe2 ] shows that @xmath95 loses its negativity at a finite time @xmath96 and becomes bound - entangled as the realignment criterion has a positive value for the interval @xmath104 . hence @xmath95 experiences distillability sudden death under multi - local decoherence as well .",
    "it is surprising to note that the dynamics of negativity is not much affected by turning off the collective field but the realignment criterion is considerably affected .",
    "we could imagine that introducing additional noise cause faster decay of entanglement , nevertheless , in this case non - distillable entanglement showed much respect to additional noise compared with distillable entanglement .",
    "let us now consider the locally equivalent state @xmath105 , which may be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - be ] ) with local unitary operation @xmath106 , with @xmath107",
    ". then we have @xmath108 where the separable states are @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , and @xmath111 a maximally entangled state .",
    "the local unitary transformations do not effect the static entanglement , however they may have a profound influence on the future trajectory of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the possible negative eigenvalues of the time evolved partially transpose matrix are given as @xmath112 again we observe that in the presence of only collective interaction , @xmath113 is always negative which implies no entanglement sudden death and no distillability sudden death .",
    "whereas in the presence of either global decoherence or multi - local decoherence , the entanglement sudden death and/or distillability sudden death may happen .    in figure [",
    "fig : dsd - lehbe1 ] , we have plotted the negativity and the realignment criterion against the decay parameter @xmath114 .",
    "we observe that distillability sudden death occurs in this case as well .",
    "the states becomes ppt at a time @xmath115 .",
    "nevertheless , the states are bound - entangled in the interval @xmath116 .",
    "the state @xmath117 is fragile compared with @xmath95 in the sense that @xmath117 becomes bound - entangled at earlier times , i.e. , distillability sudden death comes earlier as compared with dynamics of @xmath95 ( compare with figure [ fig : dsd - hbe1 ] ) .",
    "however , in this case the realignment criterion detects bound - entangled states for a broader range .",
    "figure [ fig : dsd - lehbe2 ] shows the negativity @xmath118 and @xmath119 plotted against the decay parameter @xmath114 for a specific value of parameter @xmath92 . we observe that @xmath117 becomes bound - entangled at @xmath120 .",
    "figure [ fig : dsd - lehbe2 ] is exactly like figure [ fig : dsd - hbe2 ] , which means that the local unitary transformation has no effect on the dynamics of negativity and dynamics of bound - entangled states for this particular case .",
    "finally , let us consider the isotropic states defined as @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "the isotropic states have the property that their ppt region is always separable ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , we realize that these states do not suffer distillability sudden death , however they may suffer entanglement sudden death .",
    "the possible negative eigenvalues of time evolved partially transpose matrix are given as @xmath123 we can see that isotropic states for @xmath124 , do not suffer entanglement sudden death under collective decoherence .",
    "however in the presence of global decoherence or at least for multi - local noise , they always exhibit entanglement sudden death for @xmath124 .",
    "we have revisited the entanglement dynamics of bipartite systems under global , collective and multi - local noises . in particular , we have studied the distillability sudden death of qutrit - qutrit systems .",
    "we have found that certain free - entangled qutrit - qutrit states becomes bound - entangled as a consequence of purely dynamical process .",
    "we have found that distillability sudden death may occur under the combined action of multi - local and collective noises .",
    "distillability sudden death can also result under multi - local decoherence .",
    "we have observed that local unitary transformations can not avoid this phenomenon .",
    "therefore , we conclude that qutrit - qutrit states evolve into three main types of dynamics : ( i ) they loose their entanglement only at infinity and hence never suffer entanglement sudden death and distillability sudden death .",
    "( ii ) they loose their entanglement at a finite time but never undergo distillability sudden death .",
