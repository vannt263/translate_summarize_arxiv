    "the property of asymptotic freedom of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xcite and the treatment of non - perturbative qcd have led to the qcd string approach , which has eventually initiated the motivation of string theory . with the development of string theory , it further motivated the advent of the ads / cft conjecture @xcite , which provides an alternative tool to access the gloomy non - perturbative region of qcd , that is so - called holographic qcd or ads / qcd model based on the ads / cft .",
    "these models are not perfect with some problems in its deep root of ads / cft as qcd is not a conformal field theory at low energy .",
    "there are different holographic qcd models due to different realizations and objectives .",
    "it has mainly been divided into two classes , namely top - down model and bottom - up model .",
    "the top - down models are directly constructed from string theory , the popular ones like d3/d7 , d4/d6 and d4/d8 model @xcite . while bottom - up models such as hard - wall model @xcite and soft - wall model @xcite are constructed according to properties of qcd itself from which the corresponding bulk gravity is determined . in the hard - wall model , a sharp cutoff of the fifth dimension which corresponds to the inverse of the qcd scale @xmath1",
    "is given to realize the qcd confinement .",
    "it contains chiral symmetry breaking but fails to give a correct regge behaviour for the mass spectra of hadrons . to remedy this problem , in the soft - wall model , a dilaton term",
    "is put into the bulk action to replace the sharp ir cutoff of the hard - wall model . however",
    ", the resulting model can not realize chiral symmetry breaking phenomenon consistently .",
    "several models have been constructed to incorporate these qcd behaviors@xcite , these models have made numerical predictions for the mass spectra of light mesons , such as scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "especially , in the recent paper@xcite , we have constructed an alternative model in which the metric remains conformal invariance and satisfying einstein equation , while the bulk mass and bulk coupling of the quartic scalar interaction have a bulk coordinate z - dependence , so that the ultraviolet ( uv ) behavior of the model corresponds to ads / cft , while the infrared ( ir ) behavior is required from low energy qcd features which are compatible with the leading chiral dynamic model of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking@xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we have arrived at a more consistent model with better predictions for the mass spectra of both ground and resonance states of scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "the finite temperature effects of holographic qcd has attracted lots of attention .",
    "the finite temperature effects in hard - wall ads / qcd were studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the thermal spectrum of glueballs or mesons in the soft - wall ads / qcd model was investigated . in @xcite , a soft - wall model for charmonium",
    "was built .",
    "the deconfinement temperature of soft - wall ads / qcd models was calculated in @xcite and found to be @xmath2 . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the scalar glueball and light mesons spectral have been analyzed in the soft - wall ads / qcd model and the critical temperature at which the meson states dissociation was found to be about @xmath3 .",
    "such a low temperature is far from the deconfinement transition .",
    "it indicates that the meson states dissociation occurs in the confined qcd phase and it is inconsistent with the real qcd . to remedy this problem ,",
    "we have investigated in @xcite the finite temperature effects for the metric ir - improved soft wall ads / qcd models @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature of meson dissociation was found to be around @xmath4 . where the metric is modified at ir region ,",
    "so the hawking temperature of the black hole is not exactly defined as it dose not satisfy einstein equation . thus it is interesting to analyze the critical temperature of the bulk holographic ads / qcd model built recently in@xcite , where the model incorporates both chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement with the better predictions on the mass spectra of meson states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[chap : model ] , by briefly reviewing the ir - improved bulk holographic ads / qcd model constructed recently in@xcite , we extent it to an action with finite temperature . in sec.[chap : thermal spectral ] , we analyze the thermal spectral function and carry out calculations for the meson thermal mass spectra .",
    "the corresponding melting temperature is obtained . in sec.[chap : back - reaction ] , the back - reaction effort of bulk vacuum is considered to yield an improved metric of background gravity , the thermal mass spectra are investigated in detail based on the back - reaction improved action .",
    "a reasonable melting temperature is obtained .",
    "our conclusions and remarks are presented in the final section .",
    "in this section , we will investigate the finite temperature behavior of the ir - improved bulk holographic ads / qcd model@xcite . here",
    "the ads black hole is chosen as the background to describe temperature in boundary theory , @xmath5 with @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the location of the outer horizon of the black - hole .",
    "we will set the ads radius as unity in this paper for the boundary theories .",
    "the hawking temperature which corresponds to the temperature in boundary theory is defined as follow : @xmath8    the action with finite temperature is based on the ir - improved bulk holographic ads / qcd model@xcite .",

    "the gauge coupling @xmath13 is fixed to be @xmath14 with @xmath15 the color number @xcite .",
    "the complex bulk field @xmath16 will be written into the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons , the combination of chiral gauge fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 will be identified to the vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "the dilaton field , the bulk scalar mass and quartic interaction coupling have been shown to be reasonable to take the following ir - modified forms@xcite : @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the expectation value of bulk scalar field @xmath16 has a z - dependent form for two flavor case : @xmath21 the bulk vecuum expectation value ( bvev ) @xmath22 with proper ir and uv boundary conditions has been taken the following simple form @xcite : @xmath23 with @xmath24 and the coupling constant @xmath25 is related to the vacuum expectation value via the equation of motion @xmath26    the involving five parameters have been fixed from the low energy parameters of mesons@xcite and their values are represented in table [ table : parameter ] .",
    ".the values of five parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it should be pointed out that in the above calculation the dilaton field in the action eq.([back reaction action ] ) is still taken as a background field .",
    "the back reaction effects of bulk vacuum which includes quark mass and quark condensate have increased the melting temperature to be around @xmath27 such a result is consistent with the ones yielded from lattice qcd simulations . in @xcite ,",
    "the chiral and deconfinement critical temperatures were found to be @xmath28 . in @xcite , the chiral transition temperature of two massless flavors",
    "was shown to be @xmath29 . for physics masses of three flavor quarks ,",
    "the chiral transition temperature was found to be @xmath30 mev@xcite .",
    "we have investigated the finite temperature behavior of ir - improved bulk holographic ads / qcd model built recently in@xcite .",
    "the spectral function of mesons has been analyzed following the prescription in @xcite . by fitting the spectral function with a breit - wigner form",
    ", the critical temperature of mesons is found to be around @xmath31 .",
    "it has been noticed that in low temperature region , the peaks which correspond to the poles of the green s function are consistent with the masses calculated in zero temperature case @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that there exists the vagueness of the critical temperature criterion . in obtaining the critical temperature",
    ", we have to take a range of the melting temperature with the condition between the hight ( @xmath32 ) and width ( @xmath33 ) of peak that : @xmath34 . in this paper",
    ", we have considered the back - reaction effects of bulk vacuum and yielded an improved metric of background gravity .",
    "the mesons thermal mass spectral function has been calculated based on the back - reaction improved action , which can lead the critical temperature to be increased about @xmath35 mev .",
    "a reasonable melting temperature has been found to be @xmath36 mev , which is consistent with the recent results obtained from lattice qcd simulations .",
