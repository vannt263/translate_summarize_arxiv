    "<S> laser - plasma acceleration @xcite is an emerging technique for accelerating electrons to high energies over very short distances . </S>",
    "<S> the accelerated electron bunches have femtosecond duration @xcite , making them particularly relevant for applications such as ultrafast imaging @xcite or femtosecond x - ray generation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> current laser - plasma accelerators are typically driven by joule - class laser systems that have two main drawbacks : their relatively large scale and their low repetition - rate , with a few shots per second at best . </S>",
    "<S> the accelerated electron beams have energies ranging from 100  mev @xcite to multi - gev @xcite , however a mev electron source would be more suited to many societal and scientific applications . here , we demonstrate a compact and reliable laser - plasma accelerator producing high - quality few - mev electron beams at kilohertz repetition rate . </S>",
    "<S> this breakthrough was made possible by using near - single - cycle light pulses , which lowered the required laser energy for driving the accelerator by three orders of magnitude , thus enabling high repetition - rate operation and dramatic downsizing of the laser system . </S>",
    "<S> the measured electron bunches are collimated , with an energy distribution that peaks at 5 mev and contains up to 1 pc of charge . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations reproduce all experimental features and indicate that the electron bunches are only @xmath0  fs long . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that the advent of these khz femtosecond relativistic electron sources will pave the way to wide - impact applications , such as ultrafast electron diffraction in materials @xcite with an unprecedented sub-10 fs resolution @xcite .    in a laser - plasma accelerator , </S>",
    "<S> a laser pulse is focused to ultra - high intensity in an underdense plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the laser ponderomotive force sets up a charge separation in the plasma by displacing electrons , resulting in the excitation of a large - amplitude plasma wave , also called a wakefield . </S>",
    "<S> the wakefield carries enormous electric fields , in excess of @xmath1 @xcite , that are well adapted for accelerating electrons to relativistic energies over short distances , typically less than a millimeter . </S>",
    "<S> the accelerated electron beams have femtosecond duration and are intrinsically synchronized to the laser pulse , which could lift the temporal resolution bottleneck in various experimental situations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in ultrafast electron diffraction , the temporal resolution is currently limited to more than 100  fs , but it could be improved to sub-10 fs using laser driven electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , laser - plasma accelerators in the mev range could find numerous applications with unprecedented time resolution , provided they operate reliably and at high repetition - rate . indeed , in addition to temporal resolution , ultrafast imaging and diffraction also require statistics and a high signal - to - noise ratio @xcite that can only be reached with a reliable and high repetition - rate electron source .    in this letter , we demonstrate reliable operation of a laser - plasma accelerator delivering 5  mev electrons at khz repetition - rate . </S>",
    "<S> this breakthrough was made possible by the original use of a multi - mj laser system delivering near - single - cycle laser pulses of 3.4  fs duration @xcite ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this work demonstrates the scalability of laser wakefield acceleration to the mj energy level , enabling the use of box - size and commercial laser systems for driving laser - plasma accelerators .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well established that the blow - out , or bubble regime of laser - plasma acceleration @xcite leads to the production of high - quality relativistic electron beams with narrow energy spreads and small divergence . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the laser pulse is transversely and longitudinally resonant with the plasma wavelength @xmath2 , i.e. its longitudinal and transverse sizes are comparable to @xmath2 : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the speed of light , @xmath5 the pulse duration , and @xmath6 the laser beam waist . </S>",
    "<S> when this condition is met at high intensity , @xmath7 , this results in the excitation of a very nonlinear wakefield , which takes the form of successive ion cavities surrounded by thin sheets of electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> electrons are injected in the accelerating field at the back of the ion cavity , thereby forming a bunch with femtosecond duration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the transverse fields of the cavity are focusing , which leads to a low divergence electron beam .    </S>",
    "<S> while this regime is routinely achieved in experiments using joule - class laser systems with 30  fs laser pulses , scaling down to mj - level , khz laser systems constitutes a formidable challenge because of the scaling law of the bubble regime : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the laser energy . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of @xmath9 from j to mj , a factor of 1000 , must be accompanied by a reduction in both plasma wavelength and pulse duration by a factor of 10 . </S>",
    "<S> the required pulse duration must drop from the standard @xmath10 30  fs to only @xmath11  fs , i.e. the pulse should basically contain a single light cycle . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the plasma wavelength must also be very small ( @xmath12 ) , corresponding to a high electron plasma density of @xmath13 , which , according to scaling laws @xcite leads to acceleration of electrons in the 10 mev range . </S>",
    "<S> previous attempts to accelerate electrons with mj - class lasers @xcite did not reach the blow - out regime because the pulse duration was too long ( @xmath14  fs ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these initial experiments resulted in non relativistic 100  kev electrons beams @xcite and did not yield high quality beams with femtosecond duration @xcite .    in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> plasma waves are resonantly excited by focusing the @xmath15 , @xmath16 laser pulses into a continuously flowing , @xmath17 diameter nitrogen gas jet . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum laser intensity is estimated at @xmath18 , allowing the pulse to ionize nitrogen five times , therefore providing a background electron plasma density of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron spatial and spectral distributions are measured using standard diagnostics ( see methods ) . figure  [ fig1 ] shows the characteristics of a typical electron beam observed in our experiment . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) , the beam has a rather small divergence of @xmath20mrad full width half maximum ( fwhm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the beam pointing stability is high , with fluctuations amounting to a small fraction of the beam divergence , typically a few mrad . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) shows that the beam charge depends on the electron density , which can be increased by sending the laser closer to the nozzle . </S>",
    "<S> while an injected beam starts to appear for @xmath21 , the charge goes up to @xmath22pc / shot when the density approaches @xmath23 , with the occasional observation of beams reaching 1 pc / shot . </S>",
    "<S> the rather large error bars in the figure show that the charge fluctuations are typically @xmath24  r.m.s . , indicating that we operate close to the injection threshold , as discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> the electron energy distribution is obtained by deflecting the electrons using an insertable pair of permanent magnets , as illustrated by the raw data presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> a typical energy distribution is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electron spectrum peaks at about @xmath25 , with an energy spread of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the grey line represents the r.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations of the energy distribution showing that the acceleration process is very stable .    </S>",
    "<S> the measured electrons beams , with their small divergence and peaked energy distribution , show typical features of acceleration in nonlinear , bubble - like wakefields . </S>",
    "<S> however , while these results confirm the scalability of laser - plasma acceleration , the use of single - cycle laser pulses reveals new physical effects that are usually insignificant at longer durations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , as the laser pulse is nearly composed of a single light cycle , the carrier envelope phase should have an effect on injection and acceleration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , such ultra - short pulses have an ultra - broad spectral bandwidth , spanning over an entire octave . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , dispersion effects can not be neglected during propagation in the plasma . in the linear limit </S>",
    "<S> , the pulse duration in the plasma evolves as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the r.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> fourier transform limited duration and @xmath29 is the dispersion length scale in the plasma @xcite : @xmath30 for our parameters , @xmath31 , indicating that the negative dispersion of the plasma causes rapid stretching of the single - cycle laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the experiment , we attempted to compensate this plasma dispersion by adding a small positive chirp to the laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a ) shows that the electron beam charge is maximum when a small positive chirp of @xmath32 is added to the laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this result was reproduced on multiple experimental runs , with the optimal chirp varying between @xmath33 and @xmath32 . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , a negative chirp causes a decrease of the injected charge . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b ) shows that beam energy also increases when using a small positive chirp . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for a straightforward interpretation : a positive chirp compensates the negative plasma dispersion , allowing the laser pulse to reach higher intensities within the plasma . consequently , the wakefield amplitude is higher , leading to higher injected charge and higher energy .    </S>",
    "<S> particle - in - cell simulations reproduce our experimental results and confirm our interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations were run using the experimental parameters and a positive chirp of @xmath33 was added to the pulse ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3]a ) shows the evolution of the laser intensity during propagation in the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation shows that the initially chirped pulse compresses and self - focuses as it propagates . </S>",
    "<S> it reaches a high intensity of @xmath34 around the middle of the plasma where the density is resonant with the laser pulse . at this point </S>",
    "<S> , the laser pulse is able to excite a high - amplitude wakefield . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , at this high intensity , @xmath35 is ionized through tunnel ionization , triggering electron injection into the wakefield @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the blue curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ) shows that this ionization injection mechanism is very well localized . </S>",
    "<S> local injection is an indirect but striking consequence of the large dispersion effects : the intensity stays high only over a very short distance in the plasma , i.e. when the laser is fully compressed . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , electrons are injected in the first cavity following the laser pulse , leading to a single electron bunch with duration @xmath36 , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation reproduces the divergence ( @xmath37 ) , charge ( @xmath38 ) and energy distribution , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations also confirm that negative chirps yield no accelerated electrons and that a slight positive chirp optimizes the injection and acceleration process .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , simulations suggest an explanation for the charge fluctuations observed in the experiment . changing the cep by @xmath39 causes the injected charge to increase by 15% , while the energy distribution is not modified ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the cep was not stabilized in our experiment , this accounts for some of the charge fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> simulations were also run by increasing the laser intensity by @xmath40 , resulting in a charge increase of several 100 s of fc . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the experiment operated close to the injection threshold and that using a slightly higher laser intensity might stabilize the injection process </S>",
    "<S> .    this development will allow researchers to drive laser - plasma accelerators with more compact laser systems , thereby offering high repetition - rate operation and superior reliability . </S>",
    "<S> these femtosecond , khz relativistic electron beams are now available and will open unique opportunities for a wide range of experiments such as femtosecond electron diffraction , femtosecond radiolysis or x - ray generation for fast scanning of dense objects . </S>"
