    "the notion of mostly contracting center refers to partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms and means , roughly , that all lyapunov exponents along the invariant center bundle are negative .",
    "it was introduced by bonatti , viana  @xcite as a more or less technical condition that ensured existence and finiteness of physical measures . since then",
    ", it became clear that maps with mostly contracting center have several distinctive features , that justify their study as a separate class of systems .",
    "for instance , andersson  @xcite proved that they form an open set in the space of @xmath0 diffeomorphisms , and that the physical measures vary continuously on an open and dense subset .",
    "castro  @xcite and dolgopyat  @xcite studied the mixing properties of such systems .",
    "moreover , dolgopyat  @xcite obtained several limit theorems in a similar context .",
    "in addition , melbourne , matthew  @xcite proved an almost sure invariance principle ( a strong version of the central limit theorem ) for a class of maps that includes some partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with mostly contracting center .",
    "burns , dolgopyat , pesin  @xcite studied maps with mostly contracting center in the volume preserving setting , obtaining several interesting results about ergodic components , stable ergodicity , and other aspects of the dynamics .",
    "moreover , burns , dolgopyat , pesin , pollicott  @xcite studied stable ergodicity of gibbs @xmath1-states , in the general ( non - volume preserving ) setting .    before all that , kan  @xcite exhibited a whole open set of maps on the cylinder with two physical measures whose basins are both dense in the ambient space .",
    "his construction was extended by ilyashenko , kleptsyn , saltykov  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , these maps have mostly contracting center .",
    "this construction can also be carried out in manifolds without boundary , but then it is not clear whether coexistence of physical measures can still be a robust phenomenon .",
    "this is among the questions we aim to answer in this paper : we find negative answers in some situations .",
    "systems with mostly contracting center have been found by several other authors .",

    "@xmath33 for every @xmath34 , that is , the points in @xmath35 have no heteroclinic intersections .",
    "observe that a skeleton may not exist ( for instance if @xmath28 has no periodic points ) .",

    "the closure of @xmath39 and the homoclinic class of the orbit @xmath40 both coincide with @xmath41 , which is the finite union of disjoint @xmath1-minimal component , i.e. , each unstable leaf in every component is dense in this setting .",
    "the closure of @xmath31 coincides with the closure of the essential basin of the measure @xmath38 .    in particular",
    ", the number of physical measures is precisely @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , @xmath43 for @xmath44 .    in the proof ( section  [ s.srbgeostructure ] ) we just pick , for each physical measure @xmath38 a hyperbolic periodic point @xmath45 with maximum index : such points constitute a skeleton .",
    "when their stable manifolds are everywhere dense , we get from part ( b ) of the theorem that there exist several physical measures , whose basins are intermingled .",
    "such examples , that generalize the main observation of kan  @xcite , are exhibited in section  [ s.geo-explode ] .",
    "theorem  [ t.maina ] provides us with a tool to mirror physical measures into hyperbolic periodic points , and this can be used to describe the way physical measures vary when the dynamics is modified . starting from a skeleton @xmath46 for @xmath28",
    ", we may consider its continuation @xmath47 for any nearby @xmath48 .",
    "then any maximal subset of @xmath49 satisfying condition ( ii ) is a skeleton for @xmath48 .",
    "that is the main content of the following theorem :    [ t.mainb ] there exists a @xmath0 neighborhood @xmath50 of @xmath28 such that , for any @xmath51 , any maximal subset of the continuation @xmath52 which has no heteroclinic intersections is a skeleton .",
    "consequently , the number of physical measures of @xmath48 is not larger than the number of physical measures of @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , these two numbers coincide if and only if there are no heteroclinic intersections between the continuations @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , in that case , each physical measure of @xmath48 is close to some physical measure of @xmath28 , in the weak@xmath54 topology .",
    "in addition , restricted to any subset of @xmath50 where the number of physical measures is constant , the supports of the physical measures and the closures of their essential basins vary in a lower semi - continuous fashion with the dynamics , both in the sense of the hausdorff topology .",
    "of course , this implies that the number of physical measures is an upper semi - continuous function of the dynamics .",
    "consequently , this number is locally constant on an open and dense subset of diffeomorphisms with mostly contracting center .",
    "these facts had been proved before by andersson  @xcite .",
    "one important point in our approach is that we give a definite explanation for possible `` collapse '' of physical measures : one physical measure is lost for each heteroclinic intersection that is created between the continuations of elements of the skeleton .",
    "the precise statements are in propositions  [ p.weakcollapse ] and  [ p.strongcollapse ] .",
    "we also want to explain how the basins of the physical measures vary with the dynamics in the following measure theoretical sense .",
    "define the pseudo - distance @xmath55 in the space of measurable subsets of @xmath15 .",
    "[ t.mainc ] let @xmath56 be any subset of @xmath0 diffeomorphisms with mostly contracting center such that all the diffeomorphisms in @xmath56 have the same number of physical measures .",
    "then their basins @xmath57 vary continuously with @xmath58 , relative to the pseudo - distance @xmath59 .    in subsection  [ ss.examples ]",
    "we will show how this theory can be applied to various examples , including those of kan  @xcite .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ t.mainc ] shows that the basins are quite stable from a measure - theoretical point of view .",
    "let @xmath28 be a @xmath0 partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism with mostly contracting center .",
    "as before , @xmath60 denotes the corresponding invariant splitting and @xmath61 .",
    "we call _ gibbs @xmath1-state _ of @xmath28 any invariant probability absolutely continuous along strong unstable leaves .",
    "it follows that the support is @xmath1-saturated , that is , it consists of entire unstable leaves .    the notion of gibbs @xmath1-state goes back to pesin , sinai  @xcite and was used by bonatti , viana  @xcite to construct the physical measures of diffeomorphisms with mostly contracting center .",
    "indeed , they showed that such diffeomorphisms have finitely many ergodic gibbs @xmath1-states , and these are , precisely , the physical measures .",
    "gibbs @xmath1-states also provide an alternative definition of mostly contracting center : @xmath28 has mostly contracting center if and only if all lyapunov exponents along the bundle @xmath11 are negative for every ergodic gibbs @xmath1-state .",
    "this is related to the fact that , given any disk @xmath62 inside an unstable leaf , any cesaro accumulation point of the iterates of ( normalized ) lebesgue measure on @xmath62 is a gibbs @xmath1-state .",
    "in fact , more is true : every accumulation point of @xmath63 is a gibbs @xmath1-state , for almost every @xmath64 .",
    "another useful property is that the space @xmath65 of all gibbs @xmath1-states is convex and weak@xmath54 compact .",
    "the extremal elements are the ergodic gibbs @xmath1-states .",
    "moreover , @xmath65 is an upper semi - continuous function of @xmath28 , in the sense that the set @xmath66 is closed .",
    "proofs of these facts can be found in chapter  11 of @xcite .",
    "the following fact will be used several times in what follows :    [ p.diffminimalfoliationinsupport ] if @xmath28 is a @xmath0 diffeomorphism with mostly contracting center then the supports of its physical measures , @xmath67 are pairwise disjoint . moreover",
    ", the support of every @xmath38 has finitely many connected components and each connected component is minimal for the unstable foliation ( every unstable leaf is dense ) .      the first step is to construct a skeleton :    [ p.existenceofgraph ] every @xmath0 partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism with mostly contracting center admits some skeleton .    since the center lyapunov exponents are all negative , every physical measure @xmath38 , @xmath68 is a hyperbolic measure ( meaning that all the lyapunov exponents are different from zero ) .",
    "so , by katok  @xcite , there exist periodic points @xmath69 with maximum index and whose stable manifold intersects transversely the unstable leaf of some point in the support of @xmath38 .",
    "since the support is @xmath1-saturated , invariant , and closed , it follows that @xmath70 . for each @xmath71",
    "we choose one such periodic point @xmath69 ; we are going to show that @xmath72 is a skeleton for @xmath28 .",
    "consider any @xmath18 and let @xmath62 be a disk around @xmath22 inside the corresponding unstable leaf .",
    "let @xmath24 be any cesaro accumulation point of the iterates of the volume measure @xmath73 on @xmath62 . as observed before",
    ", @xmath24 is a gibbs @xmath1-state and , hence , may be written as @xmath74 .",
    "choose @xmath71 such that @xmath75 is non - zero .",
    "let @xmath76 be a neighborhood of @xmath69 small enough that the unstable leaf through any point in @xmath76 intersects the stable manifold @xmath77 transversely .",
    "then @xmath78 , because @xmath79 , and so @xmath80 .",
    "consequently , there is @xmath81 arbitrarily large such that @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that the unstable manifold of @xmath83 intersects @xmath77 transversely . by invariance",
    ", it follows that @xmath32 intersects transversely the stable manifold of some iterate of @xmath69 .",
    "this proves condition ( i ) in the definition of skeleton .    condition ( ii ) is easy to prove .",
    "indeed , on the one hand , @xmath84 is contained in @xmath85 .",
    "on the other hand , this support can not intersect @xmath86 for any @xmath87 : otherwise , @xmath88 would be in @xmath85 , which would contradict the fact that the supports are pairwise disjoint .",
    "thus , there can indeed be no heteroclinic connections .",
    "now , we use the skeleton to analyse the physical measures :    [ p.numberofmeasures ] let @xmath28 be a @xmath0 diffeomorphism with mostly contracting center .",
    "suppose that @xmath89 is a skeleton of @xmath28",
    ". then    * @xmath90 coincides with the number of physical measure of @xmath28 ; * the closure of @xmath91 coincides with @xmath92 ; * the closure of @xmath93 coincides with the closure of @xmath94 .    to prove claim ( a ) it suffices to show that all skeletons have the same number of elements ( because the claim holds for the skeleton constructed in proposition  [ p.existenceofgraph ] )",
    "let @xmath95 be any other skeleton .",
    "by condition ( i ) in the definition , for each @xmath96 there is some @xmath37 such that @xmath97 intersects @xmath31 transversely .",
    "choose any such @xmath98 ( we will see in a while that the choice is unique ) .",
    "for the same reason , for this @xmath98 there exists some @xmath99 such that @xmath100 intersects @xmath101 transversely .",
    "it follows that @xmath97 accumulates on @xmath102 which , by condition ( ii ) in the definition , can only happen if @xmath103 .",
    "thus , @xmath98 and @xmath88 are heteroclinically related to one another . since different elements of either skeleton do not have heteroclinic intersections , this implies that @xmath98 is unique and the map @xmath104 is injective . reversing the roles of the two skeletons , we also get an injective map @xmath105 which , by construction , is the inverse of the previous one .",
    "thus , these maps are bijections and , in particular , @xmath106 .",
    "now take @xmath107 to be the skeleton obtained in proposition  [ p.existenceofgraph ] .",
    "up to renumbering , we may assume that the @xmath108 in the previous construction . also by construction , each @xmath98 is contained in the closure of @xmath84 , which coincides with the support of @xmath38 .",
    "since the unstable foliation is minimal in each connected component of the support , this implies that the closure of @xmath39 coincides with @xmath109 . to finish the proof of claim ( b ) it remains to show that this coincides with the homoclinic class of @xmath98 .",
    "we only have to prove that @xmath110 contains the closure of @xmath39 , since the converse is an immediate consequence of the definition of homoclinic class .    to this end",
    ", let @xmath62 be any disk contained in the unstable manifold of @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath24 be any cesaro accumulation point of the iterates @xmath111 .",
    "this is a gibbs @xmath1-state and it gives full measure to @xmath41 ( because @xmath112 and the latter is a compact invariant set ) .",
    "given that there are finitely many ergodic gibbs @xmath1-states , and their supports are disjoint , this implies that @xmath113 .",
    "then , by the same argument that we used in the previous proposition , there exists some large @xmath114 large such that @xmath115 intersects @xmath116 transversely .",
    "since @xmath62 is arbitrary , this means that homoclinic points are dense in the unstable manifold of @xmath40 , which implies the claim .",
    "it remains to prove the claim ( c ) .",
    "let @xmath62 be any disk contained in @xmath100 . by theorem  11.16 in @xcite , for lebesgue almost every @xmath64",
    "the sequence @xmath63 converges to some gibbs @xmath1-state .",
    "this gibbs @xmath1-state must be @xmath38 , because by proposition  [ p.diffminimalfoliationinsupport ] and part ( b ) of proposition  [ p.numberofmeasures ] , this is the unique ergodic gibbs @xmath1-state that gives weight to the closure of @xmath117 .",
    "this proves that the basin of @xmath38 intersects @xmath62 on a full lebesgue measure subset .",
    "we claim that there exists a positive lebesgue measure subset @xmath118 inside that intersection such that the stable set of any point @xmath119 contain an @xmath120-dimensional disk @xmath121 with uniform size ; moreover , these local stable disks constitute an absolutely continuous lamination ( that is , the holonomy maps of this lamination preserve zero measure sets ) .",
    "indeed , let @xmath122 be any compact ( non - invariant ) set with @xmath123 such that every point in @xmath122 has a pesin stable manifold with uniform size , and these stable manifolds constitute an absolutely continuous lamination ( existence of such sets is a classical fact in pesin theory  @xcite ) .",
    "it follows from the previous paragraph that the forward trajectory of almost every @xmath64 accumulates on @xmath122 .",
    "thus one can find a neighborhood @xmath124 of @xmath22 inside @xmath62 such that some large iterate @xmath125 intersects @xmath122 on a positive lebesgue measure subset .",
    "just take @xmath126 .",
    "see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  6.6 ) for a similar statement .",
    "let @xmath127 be a lebesgue density point for @xmath118 inside @xmath128 .",
    "since the basin contains the stable sets of all points in @xmath118 , and these are transverse to @xmath128 , it follows that every point in the local stable disk of @xmath129 is also a lebesgue density for the basin in ambient space .",
    "in particular , @xmath130 is contained in @xmath94 .",
    "since @xmath131 accumulates on @xmath31 and the essential basin is @xmath28-invariant , it follows that @xmath31 is contained in the closure of @xmath94 .",
    "now we prove the converse inequality .",
    "let @xmath129 be any lebesgue density point of the basin of @xmath38 in ambient space .",
    "using the fact that the unstable foliation is absolutely continuous ( see  @xcite ) , we can find a small disk @xmath62 around @xmath129 inside the corresponding unstable leaf such that @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath76 be a neighborhood of @xmath98 small enough that @xmath133 intersects @xmath116 transversely , for every @xmath134 .",
    "take @xmath135 .",
    "while proving part ( b ) we have shown that for such a point there exists arbitrarily large values of @xmath9 such that @xmath136 .",
    "then @xmath137 intersects @xmath116 transversely and , hence , @xmath31 intersects @xmath62 .",
    "since @xmath62 is arbitrary , it follows that @xmath129 is in the closure of @xmath31 .    combining propositions  [ p.existenceofgraph ] and  [ p.numberofmeasures ] yields theorem  [ t.maina ]",
    ".      it will be convenient to separate the two conditions in the definition of skeleton .",
    "let us call _ pre - skeleton _ any finite collection @xmath138 of saddles with maximum index satisfying condition ( i ) , that is , such that every unstable leaf @xmath32 has some point of transverse intersection with @xmath31 for some @xmath71 .",
    "thus a pre - skeleton is a skeleton if and only if there are no heteroclinic intersections between any of its points .",
    "one reason why this notion is useful is that the continuation of a pre - skeleton is always a pre - skeleton :    [ l.robustgraph ] let @xmath28 be a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism which has a pre - skeleton @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath53 , @xmath139 be the continuation of the saddles @xmath98 for nearby diffeomorphism @xmath48 . then @xmath140 is a pre - skeleton for every @xmath48 in a neighborhood of @xmath28 .",
    "this is a really a simple consequence of the fact that the unstable foliation depends continuously on the point and the dynamics .",
    "let us detail the argument .",
    "given any @xmath18 , take @xmath71 such that the unstable leaf @xmath32 has some transverse intersection @xmath141 with the stable manifold of some point in the orbit of @xmath37 .",
    "fix @xmath142 large enough so that @xmath141 is in the interior of the @xmath143-neighborhood @xmath144 of @xmath22 inside @xmath32 and in the interior of the @xmath143-neighborhood @xmath145 of the orbit of @xmath98 inside its stable manifold . then , since unstable leaves vary continuously with the point , for any @xmath146 in a small neighborhood @xmath147 of @xmath22 , there exists @xmath148 close to @xmath141 such that @xmath149 and @xmath150 intersect transversely at @xmath148 .",

    "another reason why the notion of pre - skeleton is useful to us is that every pre - skeleton contains some skeleton . to prove this",
