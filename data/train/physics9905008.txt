    "in elementary electrostatics it is well known that the relation between the voltage and the charge of a capacitor is @xmath0    where @xmath1 is voltage , @xmath2 is capasitance and @xmath3 is charge . differentiating this equation with respect to time",
    "we obtain @xmath4    where @xmath5 is a current , and the sign of @xmath1 is a matter of convention . in physiology this second relation ( [ eq2 ] ) is being used to describe how the membrane potential ( @xmath1 ) is changed when ions move across the cell membrane .",
    "unfortunately we observe that this equation also is being used in some models where one in addition keeps track of the charge ( @xmath3 ) concentrations inside and outside the cell @xcite . in those models voltage and charge",
    "are believed to be independent dynamic variables : first one determines the voltage by integrating the membrane currents , then one determines the charge by integrating the same membrane currents .",
    "the purpose of this article is to point out that integrating the membrane currents _ once _ is enough .",
    "voltage and charge can not simultaneously be independent dynamical variables in a model , simply because of ( [ eq1 ] ) .    in order to visualize the drawbacks of treating voltage and charge as independent variables , we explore numerically the nonlinear dynamics of two different models describing the pacemaker activity of the rabbit sinoatrial node .",
    "the procedure is as follows :",
    "we integrate numerically the equations of motion for a sufficiently long time to detect a steady state , 2 .",
    "we _ change _ the initial conditions and repeat 1 .",
    "first we display results from the wilders _ et al .",

    "it is thus possible to select an initial voltage and an initial charge independently .",
    "the dynamics of that model seems peculiar .",
    "an infinity of limit cycles is observed : each time we select new initial conditions a new limit cycle , corresponding to a new value of the constant of motion @xmath6 , is found .",
    "this hampers the usefulness of the model .",
    "second we display results from a new model of endresen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the voltage is not a dynamic variable . here",
    "we can not select an initial voltage independently of the initial charge , and only one limit cycle is observed .",
    "the model of wilders _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite of the pacemaker activity of the rabbit sinoatrial node serves as an excellent example of the many models where the membrane potential is thought to be independent of the intracellular and extracellular charge concentrations . in that model",
    "the equation of motion for the voltage is given by ( [ eq2 ] ) @xmath7    there are fifteen dynamic variables in that model , the voltage @xmath1 , the gating variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the ionic concentrations @xmath17_{\\rm i}$ ] , @xmath18_{\\rm rel}$ ] , @xmath18_{\\rm up}$ ] , @xmath19_{\\rm i}$ ] , @xmath20_{\\rm i}$ ] .",
    "we want to determine how the long term dynamics in that model is changed when we change the initial conditions . to keep matters simple , we only change one initial condition : the initial intracellular concentration of potassium ( @xmath21_{\\rm i}$ ] ) ; and we study the dynamics in two dimensions only : the phase space of @xmath1 and @xmath21_{\\rm i}$ ] .",

    "the point @xmath24 denotes the @xmath1 and @xmath21_{\\rm i}$ ] coordinates of the initial conditions , and the closed loop at the bottom is the limit cycle .",
    "the trajectory of the model is displayed in 1 ( a ) where we observe that the model spirals downwards from the point @xmath24 to the limit cycle .",
    "if the limit cycle in figure 1 ( b ) is unique it should be possible to reach it from another initial condition .",
    "let us try an initial condition below the limit cycle , and investigate whether the model spiral up towards it .",
    "we change the initial concentration of potassium from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , leaving the fourteen other initial conditions unchanged .",
    "the result is displayed in figure 2 .",
    "the model does not spiral upwards to the limit cycle in figure 1 , instead the model spiral downwards to a different limit cycle .",
    "we observed numerically a new limit cycle for each new initial value of @xmath21_{\\rm i}$ ] , implying the existence of an infinite number of limit cycles . the model s fundamental flaw is clearly demonstrated .",
    "in a new model @xcite of the pacemaker activity of the rabbit sinoatrial node , the membrane potential is determined by ( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath27_{\\rm i}-[\\rm k]_{\\rm e } + 2([\\rm ca]_{\\rm i}-[\\rm ca]_{\\rm e } ) + [ \\rm na]_{\\rm i}-[\\rm na]_{\\rm e } \\right\\ } \\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath28_{\\rm i}-[\\rm k]_{\\rm e } + 2([\\rm ca]_{\\rm i}-[\\rm ca]_{\\rm e } ) + [ \\rm na]_{\\rm i}-[\\rm na]_{\\rm e } \\right\\}$ ] is the charge difference , @xmath29 is faraday s constant and @xmath30 is cell volume . here",

    "@xmath1 as is always the case when charging a capacitor ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "second we notice that a tiny change in @xmath21_{\\rm i}$ ] corresponds to a large change in voltage @xmath1 , since the constant @xmath33 is large in most situations .    in figure 3",
    "we have displayed the simulation results from the model of endresen _ et al .",

    "the three initial conditions @xmath24 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 all converge towards the same limit cycle . in an extensive numerical study we have not observed any physiological initial conditions that do not converge toward this limit cycle . in fact the same limit cycle can be reached when starting from the full equilibrium situation with equal intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations @xcite .",
    "we have displayed numerical results from two types of mathematical models of the pacemaker activity of the rabbit sinoatrial node .",
    "the first type of model @xcite showed an infinite number of limit cycles , the second type of model @xcite a limit cycle that could be reached from many different initial conditions . in order to avoid the drawback with an infinite number of limit cycles seen in the first type of models",
    ", we suggest that one should not treat membrane voltage ( @xmath1 ) as a dynamic variable .",
    "instead one should calculate the voltage using ( [ eq1 ] ) , or at least select the initial conditions in agreement with ( [ eq1 ] ) @xcite .",
