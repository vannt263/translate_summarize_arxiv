    "in this paper , we extend the investigation of the properties of dark matter haloes as a function of environment to high redshifts .",

    "we find that , at each redshift , all investigated properties of haloes show some correlation with mass and environment , and that the redshift dependence of halo properties with mass is removed when such properties are investigated as a function of the rescaled mass @xmath12 , where @xmath8 is the typical mass - scale collapsing at each epoch .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : sims ] , we briefly summarise the specifics of our n - body simulations , the definitions of the halo properties that we study and the definitions of the four environments - clusters , sheets , filaments and voids .",

    "it is clear from our present analysis that such alignments are in place at redshifts of order one , and are maintained virtually unchanged over the last eight or more billion years of evolution of structure in the universe .",
    "we finally compute the spin - spin and spin - orbit correlation functions using the definitions of @xcite and @xcite . while we show the results for the @xmath96 smoothing case , we stress that qualitatively the results remain unchanged when the constant smoothing is adopted .    for the spin - spin correlation",

    "the shaded region shows the @xmath85-confidence area for the total sample , split by mass but not split by environment .",
    "the correlations within either of the environmental classes is never stronger than those for the total sample and all of them are consistent with no signal within @xmath152 .",
    "furthermore , we find no evidence for any significant redshift evolution of these correlations .",
    "the spin - orbit correlation function is shown in figure [ fig : alignjl_var ] .",
    "the strong correlation that we found at @xmath28 in paper i , extending out to several mpc , is present also out to redshift @xmath0 with no significant changes .",
    "we have used three n - body simulations , tailored to cover a range of almost five decades in mass with high resolution haloes ( @xmath153 particles ) , to investigate the dependence of halo shape , spin , formation redshift and alignment as a function of mass , environment and redshift . using the tidal stability criterion of paper i we have classified haloes to reside in four different environments : _ clusters _ , _ filaments _ , _ sheets _ and _ voids_. the attribution of haloes to these environments depends on one free parameter , @xmath73 , the length scale used to smooth the underlying mass distribution . relating this length scale to the mass contained in the gaussian filter , @xmath75 , in paper i we optimised by visual inspection the redshift zero value of @xmath154 , with @xmath2 the typical mass scale collapsing gravitationally at redshift @xmath3 . at the higher redshifts that we study in this paper , we discuss two possible choices for the smoothing mass scale : _",
    "i ) _ a smoothing scale constant with redshift ; and _ ii ) _ a smoothing scale that varies such that @xmath89 remains constant with redshift .",
    "the first approach leads to the median overdensity in each environment increasing just as expected from non - linear enhancement of density fluctuations ; the second approach maintains the median density in each environment constant with redshift .    in our analysis of the redshift evolution of the halo properties we find that , when adopting a constant ratio @xmath89 for the smoothing , the environmental influence is roughly invariant with redshift so that the mass scale at which the environmental influence sets in is roughly given by by the mass scale @xmath8 .",
    "unveiling the importance of this physical mass scale in the onset of an environmental dependence of the halo properties is a first step towards understanding the origin of the environmental role in the evolution of dark matter haloes .    adopting the physically - motivated @xmath96 smoothing at all redshifts , we have investigated the dependence of the properties of isolated dark matter haloes of masses below and above the @xmath8 threshold on their environment . in general",
    ", we find that all halo properties show some dependence on environment for halo masses @xmath5 .",
    "the strength of the correlations , however , does not change much with redshift .",
    "there is virtually no redshift evolution of the halo properties when the correlations with halo mass are expressed in terms of the normalised mass @xmath12 , indicating that the strongest evolution with redshift is related to the evolution of the mass scale for collapse , @xmath8 . in detail",
    ", our main results are summarised as follows :    * there is a strong environmental dependence of halo formation times with environment for haloes with masses @xmath5 . at any given mass in this mass regime , haloes in clusters tend to be older than haloes in the other environments , and haloes in voids form much more recently than in any other environment . the global halo population ( with no splitting for environment )",
    "is well described by a logarithmic relation between mass and formation redshift with a roughly constant slope with redshift . *",
    "the median spin parameter @xmath130 of the total halo sample , not split by environment , increases weakly with mass up to around @xmath155 at all redshifts .",
    "there is no significant residual dependence on redshift besides the mass rescaling with @xmath8 .",
    "there is an additional tendency for high mass haloes in filaments to spin more rapidly than haloes of the same mass in clusters .",
    "haloes in voids have the lowest median spin parameters .",
    "* haloes of a given ratio @xmath12 have very similar median shape parameters independent of redshift in the mass and redshift ranges that we have investigated .",
    "independent of environment , haloes are increasingly more spherical and less triaxial the lower their mass .",
    "haloes with masses @xmath5 are slightly more spherical and more oblate in clusters than in filaments , and there is a hint that the situation reverses for @xmath9 , i.e. , that haloes in filaments are more oblate than cluster halos at high masses .",
    "low - mass haloes in voids have systematically the lowest median sphericity of similar mass halos in denser environments . * in the @xmath5 mass regime , haloes in sheets tend to have spin vectors in the plane of the sheets , and haloes in filaments tend to have spin vectors pointing along the filaments ; above the @xmath8 mass scale , there is evidence that haloes in filaments reverse the previous trend and tend to have spins orthogonal to the filaments .",
    "furthermore , haloes with masses @xmath156 tend to have their major axis parallel to their host sheets or filaments , with the strength of the alignment increasing with increasing mass .",
    "this may reflect the fact that , for massive haloes , the gravitational potential field is substantially influenced by their shape and thus leads to an aligned tidal field .",
    "the alignment of halo spins and major axes with the large - scale structure that we have unveiled up to redshifts of order @xmath0 should be taken into account in studies of weak lensing maps of cosmic shear ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially in sheets and thus in regions surrounding voids .",
    "* there is no evidence for a significant spin - spin correlation between neighbouring haloes .",
    "there is in contrast a substantial halo spin - orbit alignment , whose strength appears to be independent of mass , environment and redshift up to @xmath134 : haloes in close pairs tend to spin preferentially parallel to the orbital angular momentum of the pair .",
    "an important conclusion that we draw from our study is that the environmental influence on halo properties shows an intriguing dependence on the halo mass , and appears to be essentially modulated by the typical mass scale of gravitational collapse @xmath8 at each redshift .",
    "our data suggests that the @xmath157 mass scale might indeed play the role of a _ bifurcation point _ below which many of the median properties of dark matter haloes either begin to feel the influence of their large - scale environment , or show an opposite response to their large - scale environment relative to the more massive haloes .",
    "the existence of such a thresholding mass scale in the environment - halo relationship is yet to be understood .",
