    "as in the case of bound and resonant state eigenfunctions associated with simple poles of the green s function , we may derive orthogonality and normalization rules for the gamow - jordan eigenstates in terms of regularized integrals of the generalized gamow - jordan eigenfunctions .",
    "following the same procedure as in berggren@xcite , it may be shown that , when @xmath86 has a double zero at @xmath88 , the following relations are valid ,    @xmath182    and    @xmath183   \\nonumber   \\\\   = \\lim_{\\nu\\rightarrow 0}\\int^{\\infty}_{0}e^{-\\nu    r^{2}}\\bigl(\\frac{d\\phi_{\\ell}(k_{m},r)}{dk_{m}}\\bigr)^{2 } dr.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the expression ( [ cuarentaiuno ] ) for @xmath124 and equations ( [ sesentaicuatro ] ) and ( [ sesentaicinco ] ) , it follows that ,    @xmath184    which may be rewritten as ,    @xmath185^{2}dr =   c^{2}_{\\ell}(k_{m})\\lim_{\\nu\\rightarrow 0}\\int^{\\infty}_{0}e^{-\\nu    r^{2}}\\phi^{2}_{\\ell}(k_{m},r ) dr,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    but , according to equation ( [ veintidos ] ) and ( [ veintitres ] ) , when @xmath26 has a double zero at @xmath84 , the integral in the right hand side of ( [ sesentaisiete ] ) vanishes .",
    "therefore , the integrand in the left hand side of ( [ sesentaisiete ] ) is the square of the generalized jordan - gamow eigenfunction and the relation ( [ sesentaicinco ] ) translates into    @xmath186    which shows that also the regularized integral of the square of the generalized gamow - jordan eigenfunction vanishes .",
    "an expression for the normalization constant @xmath187 in terms of a normalization integral may be obtained from ( [ sesentaicuatro ] ) ,    @xmath188    writing @xmath189 in terms of @xmath120 and recalling that the integral of @xmath190 vanishes , we get ,    @xmath191    which shows that the right hand side of ( [ setenta ] ) is the normalization integral for the gamow - jordan generalized eigenfunctions associated with a double pole degeneracy of resonances with @xmath192 as given in ( [ cuarentaidos ] ) . however , it is convenient to note that this expression does not fix the normalization rule for @xmath119 and @xmath120 in a unique way .",
    "since @xmath119 and @xmath120 are linearly independent , they have different dimensions and its product has no obvious interpretation in terms of observable quantities , therefore , there is no a priori reason to normalize both functions with the same normalization constant .",
    "thus , we still have the freedom to write ( [ setenta ] ) as    @xmath193    where @xmath187 is given in ( [ cuarentaidos ] ) and @xmath194 is a non - vanishing real or complex number that we associate with the double pole singularity of @xmath66 at @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , a more general normalization rule for the gamow and gamow - jordan generalized eigenfunction that the one proposed in ( [ cuarentaidos ] ) , ( [ cuarentaitres ] ) and ( [ cuarentaicuatro ] ) would be    @xmath195    and @xmath196 with this normalization , the orthogonality and normalization integrals for the generalized gamow - jordan eigenfunction associated to a double pole of the green s function , equations ( [ veintitres ] ) , ( [ sesentaiocho ] ) and ( [ setenta ] ) , take the form    @xmath197    @xmath198    and    @xmath199    the form of these orthogonality and normalization conditions is independent of the value of the constat @xmath194 .",
    "however , if the gamow - jordan generalized eigenfunction are normalized according to ( [ setentaidos ] ) and ( [ setentaitres ] ) the expression for the residue at the double pole of @xmath66 would be explicitly dependent on @xmath194 , since a factor @xmath200 will appear multiplying the term @xmath201 in the expression for the residue at the double pole of @xmath66 given in equation ( [ sesentaidos ] ) .",
    "@xmath202    as is evident from the definition ( [ cuarenta ] ) , the generalized eigenfunctions @xmath203 and @xmath204 have different dimensions , if one takes @xmath194 of dimension ( energy)@xmath205 the normalized eigenfunctions @xmath51 and @xmath206 have the same dimensions namely ( energy)@xmath207 so that when @xmath208 the higher order gamow - jordan vectors become jordan vectors with the same dimensions as the gamow vectors .    this freedom in the normalization rules could be used to define normalized gamow - jordan eigenfunctions with the same dimensions as those of the gamow eigenfuntions associated to simple poles of @xmath66 .",
    "in the theory of the scattering of a beam of particles by a short ranged potential , resonances are asociated to the occurrence of poles of the scattering matrix @xmath36 , the green s function @xmath66 and the scattering wave function @xmath209 .",
    "these resonance poles are caused by zeroes of the jost function lying in the fourth quadrant of the complex @xmath210plane .",
    "accordingly , a degeneracy of resonances , that is , the exact coincidence of two ( or more ) simple resonance poles of the scattering matrix , results from the exact coincidence of two ( or more ) simple resonance zeroes of the jost function , which merge into one double ( or higher rank ) zero lying in the fourth quadrant of the complex @xmath210plane .",
    "we found that , associated to a double resonance zero of the jost function , there is a jordan chain of length two@xcite of generalized gamow - jordan eigenfunctions @xmath211 belonging to the same degenerate complex energy eigenvalue @xmath149 .",
    "hence , the corresponding second rank pole occurring in the scattering matrix , @xmath36 , the green s function , @xmath66 , and the scattering wave function , @xmath15 , is also associated to this jordan chain of gamow - jordan generalized resonance eigenfunctions .    as the two simple zeroes of the jost function merge into one double zero , the two gamow eigenfunctions corresponding to the two resonances that become degenerate merge into one gamow eigenfunction or normal mode belonging to the double zero of the jost function . the other element in the jordan chain , namely , the gamow - jordan generalized eigenfunction or abnormal mode is not a proper eigenfunction of the radial hamiltonian .",
    "hence , at a degeneracy of resonances , one resonance eigenfunction or normal mode is lost , and a new kind of generalized resonance eigenfunction or abnormal mode is generated .",
    "therefore , the dimensionality of the subspace of eigenfunctions associated to a degeneracy of two resonances or geometric multiplicity , @xmath171 , of the degeneracy is one , yet , the number of times the degenerate complex energy eigenvalue is repeated in the spectral representation of @xmath11 or algebraic multiplicity of the degeneracy , @xmath170 , is two .",
    "it follows that , the algebraic multiplicity is larger than the geometric multiplicity of a degeneracy of resonances .",
    "explicit expressions for the normalized gamow and gamow - jordan generalized eigenfunctions in the jordan chain , written in terms of the outgoing wave jost solution , the jost function and its derivatives evaluated at the double zero , are obtained from the computation of the residue of the scattering wave @xmath15 function at the double pole .",
    "we also showed that the jordan chain of generalized eigenfunctions are elements of the complex biorthonormal basis formed by the real ( bound states ) and complex ( resonance states ) energy eigenfunctions which can be completed by means of a continuum of scattering wave functions of complex wave number . with the help of this result",
    ", we derived expansion theorems ( spectral representations ) for operators @xmath0 which are regular functions of the radial hamiltonian @xmath11 . in this basis , the operator @xmath0 is represented by a complex matrix which is diagonal except for one jordan block of rank two@xcite associated to the double zero of the jost function and the corresponding chain of generalized eigenvectors .",
    "the diagonal entries in this matrix are the eigenvalues @xmath160 , simple zeroes of the jost function correspond to non - degenerate eigenvalues of @xmath0 while the double zero of the jost function corresponds to the twice repeated ( degenerate ) eigenvalue @xmath212 in the diagonal entries of the jordan block .",
    "the off - diagonal , non - vanishing element in this block is @xmath213 .",
    "in particular , the occurrence of a double pole in the green s function , as function of the complex energy , is thus associated to the occurrence of a jordan block of rank two in the complex basis representation of the resolvent operator and the corresponding jordan chain of gamow - jordan generalized eigenfunctions .",
