    "quantum technologies exploit intense interactions between field and matter degrees of freedom  @xcite , and it is a typical experimental goal in this context to maximize the coupling between the two .",
    "traditional cavity qed setups have been extremely successful in this regard , yet they result in coupling frequencies that are only a tiny fraction of that of the system components  @xcite .",
    "experimental advances , for example in semiconductor microcavities and circuit qed , have now pushed the strength of light - matter interactions into the ultrastrong - coupling regime ( usc )  @xcite .",
    "this regime is characterized by the coupling frequency @xmath2 being a non - negligible fraction of the bare frequency of the matter degree of freedom , say @xmath3 . the theoretical description of the usc goes beyond the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , demanding the inclusion in the hamiltonian of terms that do not conserve the excitation numbers of the individual components  the ` counter - rotating terms ' ( cr )  @xcite .",
    "this regime has been studied extensively due to the lure of exotic phenomena such as the existence of virtual excitations in the ground state  @xcite , dynamical casimir effects  @xcite , quantum phase transitions  @xcite , and counter - intuitive radiation statistics  @xcite .    in this regime , however , the sole inclusion of the cr terms may not be sufficient to correctly describe the new physics .",
    "another important ingredient is the diamagnetic  or ` @xmath0 '  term , which is proportional to the square of the vector potential @xmath4 and ensures gauge invariance in the non - relativistic minimal coupling hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the effects associated with this term , and the related thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rules , are of crucial importance in the research on the ` dicke phase transition ' , and are still under active investigation and debate  @xcite .",
    "a further point deserving attention is that the two - level approximation , useful to simplify the description of quantum emitters , may fail in the usc  @xcite .",
    "finally , even the multi - mode nature of the cavity field is known to play a role in the ` deep strong coupling ' regime @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite .    in most of the above examples the physics beyond the cr terms , for example due to @xmath0 , becomes crucial as the strength of light - matter interactions",
    "is pushed towards the extreme regime @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , to the best of our knowledge , clear - cut _ qualitative _ signatures of these extra terms have not been discussed in the currently experimentally relevant regime @xmath7 .",
    "the present work aims at giving a contribution in this direction .",
    "we begin by studying a common hamiltonian model of light - matter interaction , in which a bosonic matter excitation is ultrastrongly coupled to a single - mode cavity field .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 term imposes an interesting constraint on the structure of the normal modes of the system , the upper and lower polariton @xcite .",
    "this implies that the bare vacuum of the matter and field modes , which is no longer the true ground state of the system , contains equal populations of the two polaritons .",
    "interestingly , this observation is independent of the specific choice of the various model parameters , provided that they are chosen compatibly with the trk sum rule . to test this finding",
    ", one needs to design an experiment that explicitly relies on the relationship between polaritons and bare modes .",
    "we show that a possible option is to perform a ` quench ' of the coupling , a rapid switch - on of @xmath2 from an initially negligible value , followed by a spectral analysis of the resulting ` quantum vacuum radiation ' exiting the cavity ( that is , radiation that is due to a non - adiabatic change of the ground state of the system ) @xcite .",
    "+ in the second part of the paper , we investigate the robustness of the considered model by interpreting it as a low - energy approximation to a coulomb gauge minimal coupling hamiltonian .",
    "this allows us to clarify the role of the trk sum rule in the considered system , as well as to identify some extra terms  besides @xmath0  that one may need to include in the effective low - energy hamiltonian to accurately model the usc . in a nutshell",
    ", one should include an effective self - interaction term for the matter , mediated by the higher cavity harmonics , plus a term describing the electrostatic interaction between the dipole and its ` images ' on the cavity walls @xcite .",
    "while the remarkable symmetry between the two populations is in general lost , we are able to gain an analytical understanding of this more complete model and the consequences of the new terms .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "we start by noting that the bare modes vacuum @xmath20 , defined by @xmath29 , does not in general coincide with the ground state of the polaritons : @xmath30 .",

    "by williamson s theorem we have @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a symplectic matrix  @xcite .",
    "hence the polaritonic modes @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 , and the bosonic commutation relations @xmath45=\\delta_{kk'}$ ] are guaranteed by construction . for our specific system , we get ( see appendix  [ diagonalizza ] ) @xmath46\\!-\\!\\sin\\theta[\\mu(\\!\\tfrac{\\omega_u}{\\omega_b}\\!)\\hat b\\!+\\!\\nu(\\!\\tfrac{\\omega_u}{\\omega_b}\\!)\\hat b^\\dagger],\\label{pu}\\\\ \\!\\!\\hat p_{l}\\!&=\\!\\sin\\theta[\\mu(\\!\\tfrac{\\omega_l}{\\omega_a}\\!)\\hat a\\!+\\!\\nu(\\!\\tfrac{\\omega_l}{\\omega_a}\\!)\\hat a^\\dagger]\\!+\\!\\cos\\theta[\\mu(\\!\\tfrac{\\omega_l}{\\omega_b}\\!)\\hat b\\!+\\!\\nu(\\!\\tfrac{\\omega_l}{\\omega_b}\\!)\\hat b^\\dagger],\\label{pl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is defined by @xmath50 ; @xmath51 .",
    "these choices are consistent with the ordering @xmath52 .",
    "it is easy to check that equations and , together with their hermitian conjugates , implicitly define a symplectic matrix @xmath53 in accordance with the general discussion above .",

    "taking a step further , we find for generic @xmath60 that the sign of @xmath61 is always the same as that of @xmath62 in a broad range of parameters ( see appendix  [ popstudy ] ) .",
    "we thus have a sufficiently general scenario in which the two populations are equal if and only if @xmath13 assumes the appropriate trk value , regardless of the specific arrangement of the remaining model parameters .",
    "note that the equality @xmath59 can also be stated as a constraint on the matrix elements of @xmath63 , without making reference to a particular quantum state of the system .",

    "was derived , implying that the product of polaritonic frequencies equals that of the bare frequencies under the trk rule @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate what constraints this may pose to the behaviour of these more general systems .",
    "in principle , the relationship between bare and polaritonic modes could be investigated via a quenching experiment .",
    "the idea is to ` switch on ' the coupling @xmath2 and the associated parameter @xmath13 non - adiabatically , starting from an initially negligible value .",
    "if the modulation is applied fast enough , the system remains in its initial state : at sufficiently low temperatures we could assume it to be the bare vacuum @xmath20 . since this is no longer the ground state of the hamiltonian for @xmath64 , the system will relax towards the vacuum of the polaritons , and to do so it must radiate photons outside the cavity .",
    "this process is a particular instance of quantum vacuum radiation @xcite . in absence of other relaxation mechanisms",
    ", we expect @xmath32 photons to be emitted at each frequency @xmath65 ( on average ) , so that a simple spectral analysis of the cavity output field could be used to test the equality @xmath59  see fig .",
    "[ fig : concept ] .",
    "this intuition is substantiated by the more quantitative discussion below . before proceeding , we note that the non - adiabatic modulation of light - matter interactions has been experimentally demonstrated in solid state setups , by inducing a fast change in the density of the available charge carriers and hence in the relevant dipole moment matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "to model the radiative relaxation of the system following the quench , we couple the cavity to a continuum of external modes @xmath66  with @xmath67=\\delta(\\omega\\!-\\!\\omega')$ ] . for simplicity",
    "we neglect matter losses and assume that all modes @xmath66 are accessible for measurement .",
    "the total hamiltonian is now @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given by eq .  , while @xmath70 and @xmath71 model the free evolution of the external modes and their coupling to the cavity . in the usc ,",
    "the open dynamics of the system is better described in terms of polaritons .",
    "we thus recast @xmath72 in terms of the operators @xmath27 , and we assume that the coupling @xmath73 is weak enough for us to perform a rwa in the interaction term @xmath74 .",

    "note that the rwa must be performed in the polaritonic basis  @xcite , since it is the operators @xmath78 that oscillate harmonically in the interaction picture .",
    "as we are investigating photon emission in a non - stationary regime , we aim to determine the statistics of the external field modes as a function of the system conditions immediately after the quench .",
    "it is convenient to do so by a somewhat unusual application of the heisenberg equations of motion .",
    "we note that the _ initial _ system operators can be expressed as a linear combination of polaritons and external modes _ at any later time _ :    .",
    "( b ) frequency distribution of the output modes ( arbitrary units ) .",
    "we have fixed @xmath21 , @xmath79 , @xmath14 in eq .  , and a frequency - independent coupling to the external modes @xmath80 , where @xmath81 would be the decay rate of the cavity in absence of the matter mode . ]    @xmath82    where the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be determined as follows .",
    "since the total time derivative must vanish on both sides , the differential equations @xmath85 and @xmath86 must hold , with initial conditions @xmath87 .",

    "could be calculated in principle , e.g. numerically , by fano - like techniques or laplace transforms @xcite . such details , however , are largely unimportant for our purposes . in standard scenarios ,",
    "eq .   will induce a dissipative dynamics of the polaritonic system , such that one has @xmath91 for sufficiently long times , and the full quantum statistics of the initial system state will be retrieved in specific combinations of the external field modes .",
    "these can be formally expressed as @xmath92 by looking at the output modes @xmath93 , we can thus access _ the full quantum statistics _ of the polaritons immediately after the quench : the mean populations are for example given by @xmath94 .",
    "we note that the main message expressed by eq .",
    "does not depend on the details of the interaction between cavity and external fields , but each asymptotic amplitude @xmath95 does , and needs to be evaluated on a case - by - case basis .",
    "typically , @xmath96 is sharply peaked around the corresponding polaritonic frequency @xmath65 , and @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be spectrally resolved ( an equivalent statement is that the timescales of emission are long as compared to @xmath99 ) . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : concept ] we plot @xmath100 for the simplest case of a frequency - independent coupling to the continuum ; we can expect qualitatively similar results when considering more realistic profiles for @xmath73 .",
    "we remark that the neglect of losses and thermal noise allowed us to derive particularly straightforward relationships between intra- and extra - cavity observables .",
    "still we can expect that , in a realistic system , eq .   can hold to a good approximation if the emission of detectable photons is the dominant relaxation process of the system .",
    "a quantitative study of these issues in lossy systems will be presented in future work .",
    "in this section we investigate the validity of hamiltonian as a low - energy approximation to a more complete microscopic model .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to clarify the role of the trk sum rule in our system , and to discuss some of the possible refinements of our basic model .",
    "in particular , we shall investigate the role of the following contributions to the matter - field interaction : ( i ) higher harmonics of the cavity field ; ( ii ) the multimode nature of matter excitations ; ( iii ) the electrostatic interaction between the dipole moment of the matter mode and the cavity boundaries .",
    "the derivations below are based on the assumption that matter excitations are well described by a collection of quantized harmonic oscillators , in analogy to the hopfield model @xcite .",
    "our calculations could also be applied to dicke - like models in the holstein - primakoff regime @xcite , although in that case we are unable to fully take into account the electrostatic dipole - dipole interactions between different atoms .",
    "only the spatially homogeneous contribution of these interactions can be included in our model , by appropriately rescaling the parameter @xmath101 defined below @xcite .",
    "we assume that our matter mode can be microscopically described as a collection of non - relativistic particles of mass @xmath102 and charge @xmath103 , subject to a potential @xmath104 that includes trapping forces as well as inter - particle interactions ( in absence of the cavity ) .",
    "the interaction with the electromagnetic field in the cavity is modeled via a minimal coupling hamiltonian in the coulomb gauge , as per @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the momentum of the @xmath107th particle , @xmath108 its position , @xmath4 is the vector potential operator , @xmath109 is the electrostatic interaction between matter and cavity walls @xcite , and @xmath110 is the free hamiltonian of the field .",
    "we adopt the dipole approximation : the effective linear size of our emitter is assumed to be much smaller than the wavelength of light under consideration , hence the spatial dependence of @xmath4 across the emitter is neglected . in a similar spirit",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath109 depends only on the total dipole moment of the matter excitations ( in simple geometries , it can thus be calculated with the _ method of images _ ) . since the components of @xmath4 commute with all particle operators",
    ", we can expand the hamiltonian as @xmath111 note that @xmath112 includes all the hamiltonian terms that would be suddenly switched on in the quenching experiment described earlier : indeed , all these terms depend on the effective dipole moment of matter .",
    "it is now useful to define @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the _ electric dipole operator _",
    ", while @xmath115 resembles a current operator ( note however that @xmath106 is the canonical momentum , not the kinetic one ) .",
    "we can thus rewrite the microscopic hamiltonian as @xmath116 we now recall the trk sum rule .",
    "let @xmath117 have a complete set of eigenstates @xmath118 with associated eigenvalues @xmath119 ( these would be the eigenstates of matter in absence of interaction with radiation ) .",
    "we recall that the completeness relation @xmath120 holds in the hilbert space of the matter degrees of freedom , and we set the energy of the bare ground state @xmath121 to zero for convenience . exploiting the commutation relations @xmath122&=-i\\hat{\\mathbf{j}},\\label{hdj}\\\\ [ \\hat d_{k},\\hat j_l]&=i\\delta_{kl}\\sum_jq_j^2/m_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can derive the equality @xcite : @xmath123 eq .   is a possible formulation of the trk sum rule for the ground state .",
    "note that it is an equality for _ field operators _ , since the matrix elements are only taken in the hilbert space of the matter degrees of freedom .",
    "we anticipate that from eq .",
    "it is possible to derive the crucial equality @xmath124 by a somewhat crude two - mode approximation , in which one substitutes @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( @xmath127 and @xmath128 are constant vectors of the appropriate units  see below ) .",
    "consistency with eq .",
    "then implies @xmath129 .",
    "finally , the equality of interest is obtained if one notices that the relevant coupling constants , in our notation , are given by @xmath130 and @xmath131 .    in what follows",
    ", we shall show that the above reasoning is indeed correct under certain approximations .",
    "inspired by the hopfield model @xcite , we now assume that the matter degrees of freedom are well - approximated by a collection of harmonic excitations @xmath132 of frequency @xmath133 , and that the relevant matter operators can be expanded as @xmath134 where the constant vectors @xmath135 encode information about the amplitude and polarization of matter excitations , and we have maintained consistency with eq .  .",
    "the meaning of the approximation signs in eqs .  - is discussed in more detail in appendix  [ appb ] ; the bottom line is that the additional excitations of matter not captured by the modes @xmath132 can be adiabatically eliminated , and their contribution drops out from both sides of the equal sign in the trk sum rule .",
    "we can now expand the vector potential of the field , at the location of the matter mode , as @xmath136 where each @xmath137 is a constant vector characterising the single - photon field amplitude and polarization of the @xmath138-th cavity mode , with associated bosonic annihilation operator @xmath139 .",
    "the full hamiltonian can thus be recast as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the bare frequency of the @xmath138-th cavity mode , @xmath142 quantifies the coupling strength between the @xmath143-th matter excitation and @xmath138-th cavity mode , and consistency with the sum rule in eq .",
    "fixes @xmath144  @xcite .",
    "note that we have not specified yet the electrostatic contribution @xmath109 : here we shall not attempt to study the structure of this term from first principles , rather we will assume that it is a quadratic function of the dipole moment @xmath114 ; this corresponds to the assumption that the induced charge densities on the cavity walls will depend linearly on the dipole moment components .      to recover a simpler hamiltonian resembling eq .",
    ", we shall now assume that the lowest - frequency modes @xmath145 and @xmath146 are dominant in the interaction .",
    "intuitively , this should hold when the two frequencies @xmath147 and @xmath148 are of the same order , the coupling @xmath149 is not too large ( as compared to @xmath150 ) , and the trk sum rule is approximately saturated by the considered transition : @xmath151 ( this also implies that @xmath127 and @xmath152 should be approximately parallel to each other ) .",
