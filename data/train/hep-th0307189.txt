    "the two - dimensional quantum gravity ( ) allows two complementary descriptions based on liouville field theory @xcite or on dynamical triangulations @xcite . from the point of view of string theory ,",
    "is the theory of non - critical bosonic strings , which do not have a tachyon state and therefore admit an interpretation as statistical ensemble of embedded worldsheets .",
    "( for reviews see @xcite . ) in this paper we will consider the boundary problem in the two descriptions . we will present a systematic approach to evaluate the boundary correlation functions in liouville and discrete   based on a set of difference equations with respect to the boundary parameters . although derived by completely different methods , the difference equations for the two- and three - point functions obtained in both approaches become identical after rescaling with an appropriate factor .",
    "this factor does not depend on the liouville boundary parameters and has a natural interpretation as the contribution of the matter fields .",
    "the first success of the continuum approach was to predict the scaling exponents of gravitationally dressed primary fields @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the so - called resonance correlation functions of vertex operators were found by doing the zero mode integration over the liouville field and then using analytic continuation with respect of the number of the liouville interaction insertions @xcite .",
    "these results showed that the liouville cft , although ` noncompact ' , can be treated similarly to the standard ` compact ' conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "indeed , in a series of impressive works @xcite , the liouville cft has been practically solved .",
    "the exact expressions obtained for the bulk @xcite and boundary @xcite liouville structure constants were obtained as solutions of a set of identities that follow from the ope of vertex operators with degenerate bulk or boundary liouville fields .    in liouville theory with boundary",
    "the situation is more subtle because of the presence , besides the cosmological constant @xmath2 , of a second dimensional parameter , the boundary cosmological constant @xmath3 .",
    "the boundary liouville structure constants thus depend on a new dimensionless parameter , @xmath4 .",
    "the observables are meromorphic functions of this parameter having a branch point singularity at the point @xmath5 where @xmath3 equals the boundary entropy density .",
    "the branch point can be resolved by introducing a uniformization parameter @xmath6 in the correlation function of @xmath7 boundary operators on the disc , one can define @xmath7 independent boundary cosmological constants @xmath8 associated with the segments between two neighboring operators .",
    "fateev , a. zamolodchikov and al .",
    "zamolodchikov @xcite found that the boundary two - point function , or boundary reflection amplitude , satisfies a simple functional equation , which can be given the form of a difference equation with respect to one of the boundary parameters , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "one can show ( see section 3 of this paper ) that this is a general property of the liouville boundary structure constants : all they satisfy recurrence identities that have the form of difference equations with respect to one of the boundary parameters . in particular , using the pentagonal equation satisfied by the boundary three point function @xcite , we find two difference equations for the latter , one of them quite similar to the equation obtained in @xcite",
    ". the shifts of the boundary parameters come from the fusion with the lowest degenerate boundary liouville fields .",
    "the two and three point functions in   are products of the corresponding liouville and matter structure constants , and therefore have the same dependence on the boundary parameters . as a consequence",
    ", they should satisfy difference equations of the same form .    in this paper we will concentrate in the simplest realization of the matter field",
    "is as a gaussian field with background charge .",
    "then the matter three - point function is trivial ( no matter screening charges ) and the difference equation obtained in liouville theory should hold also for the three - point boundary correlator in 2d quantum gravity .    in order to check this result experimentally , we need an adequate lattice realization of the gaussian field coupled to liouville .",
    "this realization is given by the sos model on a random surface and the related statistical models : the @xmath11 @xcite and the ade @xcite models of quantum gravity .",
    "in all these models the matter fields are described as a loop gas on the random surface .",
    "the loop gas realization of   has been particularly useful in studying problems involving two - dimensional geometrical critical phenomena , typically associated with non - unitary cft ( see , for example , the review @xcite ) . after being transposed to a random surface ,",
    "many of those problems become easily solvable .",
    "the solutions then can be used to obtain information about the same problems before coupling to gravity . in particular ,",
    "the scaling dimensions in the theory on the plane are related to the gravitational dimensions by kpz scaling formula @xcite .",
    "the kpz rule was checked on various microscopic realizations of the 2d quantum gravity in terms of statistical models on random lattices and in the last years have been applied successfully to evaluate some difficult `` flat '' geometrical critical exponents associated with percolating clusters and polymers @xcite .    in the loop gas model , the matter fields",
    "are represented by non - intersecting loops ( which can be also interpreted as domain walls ) on a randomly triangulated surface .",
    "the corresponding cft is non - unitary , with continuous spectrum of the central charge @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the matter correlation functions describe the critical behavior of networks of linear polymers @xcite .",
    "bulk correlation functions of linear polymers have been first calculated in @xcite using a factorization property of the measure over random surfaces .",
    "the same method is readily generalized to the case of boundary correlation functions .",
    "more complicated examples of boundary correlators have been calculated in @xcite , including the 2-point function for the boundary twist operators intertwining between the free and fixed boundary conditions .",
    "the exact results presented in @xcite inspired the work @xcite , where it was shown that the boundary two - point function of star polymers on a random disc satisfies , when appropriately normalized , the same difference equation as the liouville boundary reflection amplitude for degenerate fields of type @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "it was also noticed that the two - point function of the boundary twist operator calculated previously in@xcite agrees with the general formula presented in @xcite with the corresponding identification of the twist operator as a boundary conformal field .",
    "here we apply the approach of @xcite to derive difference equations for the boundary three - point function and the bulk - boundary correlation function . comparing the results with those obtained in liouville",
    "theory we find that there is perfect agreement between the continuum and the discrete approaches .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we sketch the world sheet description of 2d qg as a theory of a gaussian matter field @xmath15 with background charge @xmath16 , and a liouville field @xmath17 with background charge @xmath18 and exponential interaction .",
    "we introduce the kpz primary fields in the bulk and on the boundary .",
    "3 contains a review of the boundary liouville problem and the recent results @xcite .",
    "there we summarize the finite - difference equations satisfied by the boundary structure constants . in sect .",
    "4 we interpret the difference equations obtained in pure liouville theory from the point of view of  with gausian matter field . in sect .",
    "5 we give the microscopic definition of the 2d qg as a non - restricted height model on the dynamically triangulated disc .",
    "first we define the height model on a given triangulation and establish the equivalence with a gas of loops .",
    "we give the loop - gas formulation of the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions as well as that of the electric , magnetic and twist operator of the gaussian field . in sect .",
    "6 we derive the difference equations for the basic boundary correlation functions in 2d qg .",
    "first we remind how the loop equation for the disc amplitude can be solved by being transformed into finite - difference equation .",
    "then , using the knowledge of the disc amplitude , we derive another type of functional identities using a factorization property of the functional measure of 2d qg . these identities are most easily obtained for the correlation functions involving degenerate matter operators with dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "these operators are described geometrically as sources of open lines starting at the boundary .",
    "we also consider the case where both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are present . here",
    "we derive a difference equation for the correlator of two intertwiners between dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , which we call boundary twist operators , and a vertex operator with arbitrary charge .",

    "@xmath22 the fluctuations of the metric are described by a local field @xmath17 ( the liouville field ) with exponential interaction , which couples to the matter field through the conformal anomaly @xcite .",

    "after conformally mapping the disc @xmath19 to the upper half plane , the curvature term disappears and the background charges are introduced through the asymptotics of the fields at spatial infinity @xmath32 the partition function on the disc is defined as the functional integral over the fields @xmath15 and @xmath17 with action ( [ actg ] ) to define the functional measure we have to fix the boundary conditions . in order to have correspondence with the sum over triangulated surfaces one should impose non - homogeneous neumann boundary condition for the liouville field @xmath33 while the matter field @xmath15 can satisfy either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions .",
