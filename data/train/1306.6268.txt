    "while the exchange interaction is the largest energy scale of ferromagnets , explaining curie temperatures of up to 1000 k , the static equilibrium and dynamic properties of the magnetization field in ferromagnetic materials are governed by the dipolar and crystal anisotropy fields @xcite . since the total angular momentum of an isolated system is conserved , any change of the magnetization exerts a torque on the underlying lattice , as measured by einstein and de haas @xcite .",
