    "the detection of massive amounts of dust in hyperluminous infrared ( ir ) galaxies at redshifts @xmath3 raises challenging questions about the sources capable of producing such large amount of dust during the relatively short lifetime of these galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the galaxy sdss j1148 + 5251 ( hereafter j1148 + 5251 ) located at @xmath0 was observed at far - ir and submillimeter wavelength @xcite .",
    "figure [ dustspec ] depicts the observed fluxes and spectral fits of various dust emission models through the data .",
    "the average ir luminosity of the source is @xmath4  @xmath5 , and the average dust mass is @xmath6  @xmath1 . using the kennicutt relation @xcite , one can derive a star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath7  @xmath1  yr@xmath8 from the observed far - ir luminosity . for comparison",
    ", the milky way galaxy is about 10  gyr old , has an average sfr of @xmath9  @xmath1  yr@xmath8 , and contains about @xmath10  @xmath1  of dust , a significant fraction of which was produced in agb stars .",
    "@xmath1  and luminosities range from @xmath11  @xmath5 , depending on dust composition . references to the observations can be found in @xcite.,width=384 ]    at @xmath12 the universe was only 890  myr old , using standard @xmath13cdm parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 ) .",
    "if j1148 + 5251  formed at @xmath17 then the galaxy is only 400  myr old .",
    "if the sfr had occured at a constant rate over the lifetime of the galaxy , its initial mass should have been about 10@xmath18  @xmath1 , which is significantly larger than the dynamical mass @xmath19  @xmath1  of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the high observed sfr may therefore represent a recent burst of star formation that has lasted for only about 20  myr .",
    "the galaxy j1148 + 5251  is therefore at most @xmath20  myr old , and probably significantly younger with an age of only @xmath21  myr . adopting a current gas mass of @xmath22  @xmath1  for this galaxy",
    "we get that the gas mass fraction at 400  myr is about 0.60 .",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio is given by @xmath23 .",
    "a significant fraction of the dust in the milky way was produced in agb stars .",
    "however , these stars are not likely to contribute significantly to the formation of dust in very young galaxies , since the low mass stars ( @xmath24  @xmath1 ) that produce most of the dust did not have time to evolve off the main sequence @xcite .",
    "in contrast , core collapse supernovae ( sne ) ( @xmath25  @xmath1 ) inject their nucleosynthetic products back into the ism shortly ( @xmath26  myr ) after their formation , resulting in the rapid enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) with the dust that formed in their explosive ejecta . but can sne account for the large amount of dust seen in this object ?",
    "the answer to this question is complicated by the fact that sne are also the main source of grain destruction during the remnant phase of their evolution @xcite .",
    "the problem can therefore only be addressed with a detailed model for the evolution of dust in these systems .",
    "the evolution of dust is best studied in the framework of chemical evolution models that follow the galactic metal enrichment resulting from stellar nucleosynthesis ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such chemical evolution models need to be generalized to include processes unique to the evolution of dust : the condensation efficiency of the refractory elements in stellar ejecta , the destruction of grains in the ism by expanding supernova remnants ( snrs ) , and the growth and coagulation of grains in clouds @xcite .",
    "figure [ dustvol ] shows the evolution of sn and agb  condensed dust as a function of time .",
    "details of the dust evolution model are given in @xcite .",
    "sne can form both silicate and carbon dust since their ejecta have layers with different c / o ratios that may be larger or smaller than unity which are never microscopically - mixed .",
    "in contrast , the ejecta of agb stars are either carbon- or oxygen - rich .",
    "ideally , agb stars are therefore expected to form either carbon or silicate dust .",
    "observations show that some stellar outflows may have more complex chemistry which may be the results of mass loss from a binary system , since they show the presence of both silicates and c - rich dust products @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", the evolutionary models used in figure [ dustvol ] assume that stars with masses below 8  @xmath1  form either carbon or silicate dust depending on the c / o ratio in their ejecta , and that higher mass stars that end as core  collapse sne form both silicate and carbon dust according to the prescription used by @xcite .",
    "for agb stars , the figure depicts only their contribution to the carbon dust enrichment of the ism .",
    "the most massive agb stars are o - rich , so that the onset of the agb contribution to the carbon dust abundance is delayed until the c - rich stars evolve off the main sequence .",
    "however , the imf - weighted yield of carbon dust peaks at stellar masses of about 2  @xmath1 , so most of the carbon dust is injected into the ism with a delay time between 0.4 and 4  gyr , depending on the star formation history and the grain destruction rate . the subsequent decline in the yield of carbon dust results from the fact that lower mass agb stars are o - rich and will only form silicates in their ejecta .",
    "the qualitative features of this dust evolution model were recently confirmed by mid - ir photometric and spectral observations of the features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules in nearby galaxies with the _ spitzer _  and _ iso _  _ infrared space observatory _ satellites ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "the observations showed a deficiency in pah emission from low metallicity galaxies , and a trend of increased emission in galaxies with higher metallicity .",
    "the pah _ abundance _ , derived from detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution of nearby galaxies @xcite , also correlated with their metallicity .",
    "this trend can be explained as a natural consequence of stellar evolutionary effects . since pahs are made in agb stars , the trend simply reflects the delayed injection of these macromolecules into the ism @xcite .",
    "figure [ pahvol ] is a mapping of the trend of pah abundance with age onto a trend with metallicity for the same chemical evolution model .",
    "the figure illustrates the disctinct evolutionary trends of sn- and agb - condensed dust .",
    "the shaded area represents the range of model predictions for different grain destruction and star formation rates .",
    "details of the chemical evolution model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the detailed dust evolution models described above show that the contribution of agb stars to metal and dust abundance can be neglected in galaxies with ages less than about 400  myr .",
    "the equations for the chemical evolution of the galaxy can then be solved using the instantaneous recycling approximation , which assumes that stars return their ejecta back to the ism promply after their formation . in the following",
    "we present the results for a closed box model .",
    "the case for the infall model is given in @xcite .",
    "in the closed box model , the mass of the ism changes due to the process of star formation ( astration ) at a rate given by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fraction of the stellar mass that is returned back to the ism during the stellar lifetime . assuming that the sfr , @xmath29 , is proportional to the gas mass to some power @xmath30 , we can write that : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass of the system which initially consists of only gas , @xmath33(t ) is the fractional mass of gas at later times @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is a parameter that is adjusted to fit the observed gas mass fraction at @xmath36  myr , taken to be the age of the galaxy .",
    "the equation for @xmath37 can then be written in terms of the gas mass fraction as : @xmath38    analytical solutions are available for arbitrary values of @xmath30 : @xmath39 \\qquad",
    "\\qquad \\qquad k=1 \\\\",

    "the lifetime for grain destruction is given by : @xmath47 where @xmath48  is the effective mass of ism gas in which the dust grains are completely destroyed by a single snr . in our galaxy , @xmath49  @xmath1 , @xmath50  yr@xmath8 and @xmath48  @xmath51  @xmath1 , giving an average dust lifetime of @xmath52  yr @xcite . the sn rate can be written as : @xmath53 where @xmath54  is the mass of all stars born per supernova event .",
    "for example , for a salpeter imf in the 0.1 and 100  @xmath1  range of stellar masses , @xmath54@xmath55  @xmath1 .",
    "using equations ( [ dmugdt ] ) and ( [ dmddt ] ) , the evolution of the dust mass can be expressed as a function of the remaining gas fraction as : @xmath56\\ \\left(1-{\\mu_g}^{\\nu-1}\\right ) \\label{md_mu }   \\label{md_mu}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a dimensionless parameter : @xmath58 the expression for @xmath59 is independent of the star formation history of the galaxy , but depends on the details of the imf .",
    "equation ( [ md_mu ] ) can be rewritten to give the dust yield required to obtain a given dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath43 , when the galaxy reaches a given gas mass fraction @xmath33 : @xmath60 \\label{ydzd}\\ ] ]    figure  [ snyield ] shows how much dust an average sn _ must _ produce in order to give rise to a given dust - to - gas mass ratio , for various grain destruction efficiencies .",
    "the value of @xmath44  was calculated when @xmath33  reaches a value of 0.60 , the adopted gas mass fraction of j1148 + 5251  at 400  myr .",
    "calculations were performed for two different functional forms of the stellar imf : a salpeter imf in which @xmath61 and @xmath62(@xmath1 ) @xmath63 ; and a top heavy imf characterized by the same mass limits but a flatter slope @xmath64 . here , @xmath65 is the number of stars per unit mass interval , normalized to unity between 0.1 and 100  @xmath1 .",
    "the figure shows that , for example , to produce a value of @xmath66 at @xmath33  = 0.60 , a sn must produce about 0.4  ( 1.2 )  @xmath1  of dust for a top - heavy ( salpeter ) imf , provided the dust is not destroyed in the ism , that is , @xmath48",
    "= 0 . even with modest amount of grain destruction , @xmath48  = 100  @xmath1 , the required sn dust yield is dramatically increased to about @xmath67  @xmath1 , depending on the imf .",
    "the horizontal line in the figure corresponds to a value of @xmath44  = 0.054  @xmath1 , the largest mass of dust inferred to be present in the ejecta of the supernova remnant cas  a @xcite .",
    "contrary to the claim by @xcite , this yield is not sufficient to account for the large amount of dust observed in high redshift galaxies , since the chemical evolution models of @xcite do not include the effect of grain destruction .",
    "the figure shows that even without grain destruction , the largest observed yield can only give rise to a dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath68 .",
    "if the mass of dust in the ejecta of cas  a represents a typical sn yield , then other processes , such as accretion onto preexisting grains in molecular clouds is needed to produce the mass of dust in j1148 + 5251 .    ,",

    "the horizontal dashed line near the bottom of the figure corresponds a value of @xmath70  @xmath1 , the highest inferred yield of dust in supernova ejecta to date @xcite .",
    "the vertical dotted line represents the value of @xmath69 at @xmath71 .",
    "curves are labeled by @xmath48  given in units of @xmath1 .",

    "the early universe is a unique environment for studying the role of massive stars in the formation and destruction of dust .",
    "the equations describing their chemical evolution can be greatly simplified by using the instantaneous recycling approximation , and by neglecting the delayed contribution of low mass stars to the metal and dust abundance of the ism . neglecting any accretion of metals onto pre - existing dust in the interstellar medium ,",
    "the evolution of the dust is then primarily determined by the condensation efficiency of refractory elements in the ejecta of type  ii supernovae , and the destruction efficiency of dust by sn blast waves .",
    "we applied our general results to j1148 + 5251 , a dusty , hyperluminous quasar at redshift @xmath0 and found that the formation of a dust mass fraction of @xmath66 in a galaxy with an ism mass of @xmath72  @xmath1 , requires an average sn to produce between 0.5 and 1  @xmath1  of dust if there was no grain destruction ( fig .",
