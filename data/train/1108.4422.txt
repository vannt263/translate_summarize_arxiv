    "the [ sc / fe ] ratio for the stars in the sample is generally clustered around the solar abundance ratio .",
    "the [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] abundance ratios for all our sample stars are found to be deficient relative to the solar abundance by @xmath133 and @xmath134 dex , respectively .",
    "we remind the reader that the [ cr / fe ] ratios are based upon only the cr i abundances , as there is a @xmath135 dex offset between cr i and cr ii derived abundances .",
    "the [ co / fe ] , [ ni / fe ] , and [ zn / fe ] ratios in the sample stars are generally enhanced relative to the solar abundance ratios by 0.42 , 0.05 , and 0.25 dex , respectively .",
    "the fe - peak elements are created in various late burning stages ( see @xcite ) , as well as in supernovae .",
    "our fe - peak abundance trends follow those of other halo star samples and generally indicate a successive increase of these elements over time ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we will use the fe - peak elemental abundances of the large cash sample to put constraints on the nucleosynthesis yields of the progenitor stars .",
    "for example , the measured zn abundances , which we can measure in the hrs spectra , are sensitive to the explosion energy of supernovae @xcite .",
    "the study of neutron - capture elements allows for testing of different sites of nucleosynthesis , beyond proton and @xmath10-capture .",
    "see @xcite for a comprehensive overview of the neutron - capture stellar abundances .",
    "neutron capture occurs mainly in two locations : in the envelopes of highly evolved asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( s - process ) and in some sort of explosive event , likely a core - collapse supernova ( r - process ) .",
    "the contributions of each process to the total elemental abundance of the neutron - capture elements in a given star can be determined by evaluating the collective neutron - capture abundance patterns .",
    "for example , in the solar system abundances , the s - process contributes @xmath136 of the ba abundance , with a @xmath137 contribution from the r - process , whereas eu is made almost entirely from the r - process @xcite ; however , these ratios may differ in the early universe .",
    "unfortunately , there are not enough neutron - capture elements detectable in the hrs snapshot spectra to determine whether the abundances of neutron - capture elements in a given star have an s- or r - process origin .",
    "we measured sr and ba for all stars in the mike sample .",
    "we also detected y and zr in many of the stars as well , though the s / n near the y lines often preclude us from measuring it , and the zr feature is often too weak .",
    "we measured la in only four pilot sample stars : he  2238@xmath30131 , he  0420@xmath300123a , he  1317@xmath30407 , and he  2253@xmath30840 and in the standard star cs  22873@xmath3166 .",
    "europium lines have been detected in the high - resolution spectra of the same five stars . in figures",
    "[ ladet ] and  [ eudet ] we show line detections of la and eu in each star , respectively .",
    "the four sample stars are all neutron - capture enhanced , ranging in [ eu / fe ] from 0.02 to 0.79 dex , while cs  22873@xmath3166 is depleted in [ eu / fe ] relative to the solar abundance ratio . according to @xcite he  0420 + 0123a is a mildly r - process enhanced ( r - i ) star due to its [ eu / fe ] ratio ( 0.79 ) and ba / eu ratio ( @xmath138 ) .",

    "only the @xmath140 line is a detection.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for each of these neutron - capture enhanced stars , we normalized their log @xmath141(x ) abundances relative to the ba abundance and plotted them against a solar system r - process abundance pattern .",
    "we also normalized the solar system s - process abundance pattern to fit the derived ba abundance .",
    "we found that the r - process pattern seemed to fit the ratio of la to eu better than the s - process pattern , as the eu abundances would have to be an order of magnitude lower to match the s - process pattern .",
    "figure  [ rproc ] shows this analysis .",
    "the first neutron - capture peak elements ( sr , y , zr ) show a @xmath142 dex range of abundances , though some are enhanced relative to the r - process curve .",
    "this may indicate two things : i ) the r - process seems a likely explanation for the eu abundances and ii ) a nucleosynthetic event besides the same r - process that formed a portion of the neutron - capture elements in the solar system must be contributing in some of the stars to explain their first neutron - capture peak elemental abundance range .",

    "all these extreme emp ( eemp ) stars have enhancements in the [ @xmath10/fe ] ratios , depletion in some of the fe - peak abundance ratios , and none are neutron - capture enhanced .",
    "we detected the @xmath816707 li i line in he  2302@xmath32154a , which can be expected given that it is the warmest of the eemp stars at t@xmath146 = 4675k .",
    "generally , these stars are indistinguishable from the rest of the sample , with the following exception .",
    "it is noteworthy that all five eemp stars show enhancement in their [ c / fe ] abundance ratios .",
    "this confirms the trend toward higher [ c / fe ] ratios towards lower values of [ fe / h ] , noted first by @xcite and @xcite . without consideration for the evolutionary stage of the stars ,",
    "the average [ c / fe ] ratio for the eemp stars is 0.43 , while the rest of the sample has an average [ c / fe ] ratio of 0.07 dex .",
    "however , given the high luminosity of the eemp stars , the [ c / fe ] ratios have been depleted due to the operation of the cn cycle . taking this effect into account , two stars are mildly c enriched and two are considered cemp stars following the definition of @xcite .",
    "the two cemp stars lack neutron - capture enhancement , which indicates that these stars are cemp - no stars @xcite , adding to the growing number of these objects at the lowest metallicities .",
    "we did not detect either the la or eu lines in any of these stars .",
    "this is largely due to the fact that it is difficult to detect eu in emp stars unless the eu abundance is significantly enhanced . given that we do not see strong la enhancement along with the carbon enhancement in the eemp stars , it is likely that their observed abundance patterns were the result of massive stars , rather than low mass stars , which produce la in the agb stage of stellar evolution .      for twelve of the pilot sample stars , we derived multiple - epoch measurements of their radial velocity . for three stars , we have additional radial velocity measurements from the solar spectrum - contaminated het hrs spectra . for the remaining two stars",
    ", we do not have multiple measurements .",
    "generally , the radial velocity measurements were taken with a baseline of at least one year and in some cases , three years .",
    "the hrs and mike radial velocities agree to within 2.5 km / s for those stars .",
    "we find one binary candidate in our sample .",
    "he  0015 + 0048a is the one exception ; the time span between measurements is three years and we find a radial velocity variation of 8.0 km / s .",
    "future monitoring of this star will confirm its binarity .",
    "this sample is too small to make any definitive statement on the binary fraction of metal - poor stars .",
    "we have presented the abundances or upper limits of 20 elements ( li , c , mg , al , si , ca , sc , ti , cr , mn , fe , co , ni , zn , sr , y , zr , ba , la , and eu ) for 16 new stars and four standard stars derived from high - resolution , high s / n mike spectra via traditional manual analysis methods using the moog code . we find that , with the exception of mg , our abundances match well with those of other halo stars reported in the literature , e.g. , @xcite .    in the pilot sample",
    "we find several distinct chemical groupings of stars , indicating different enrichment mechanisms may apply for each of these groups , though the exact mechanism is still uncertain .",
    "we find four new stars with @xmath2 } < -3.6 $ ] , where the metallicity distribution function severely drops .",
    "we find cs  22891@xmath3200 to have a lower @xmath2}$ ] value than reported by @xcite , bringing the total number of @xmath2 } < -3.6 $ ] stars to five .",
    "all of these stars are enhanced in their [ c / fe ] abundance ratios relative to the solar values .",
    "we have four cemp stars in our sample .",
    "two of these are eemp cemp - no stars , which confirms the trend of an increasing enhancement in c towards lowest metallicities without invoking the contribution of agb stars at the lowest metallicities .",
    "this may suggest that massive stars released c from their atmospheres and enriched the local ism and/or that the sample stars did not all form in the same region .",
    "we detected la and eu in five stars .",
    "of these , four are neutron - capture element enhanced with r - process signatures , based upon their [ eu / fe ] ratios , ranging from 0.02 to 0.79 ; the star with the highest [ eu / fe ] abundance ratio is an r - i star . for the remaining stars , we generally find scaled solar system abundance ratios with very small scatter in the abundances .",
    "this may indicate the presence of core - collapse supernovae in the early universe . in the pilot sample",
    ", we have one star that is a binary candidate . future monitoring of this star will determine its binarity status .",

    "the cashcode pipeline will be employed for the full @xmath5 star snapshot sample .",
    "this sample will be used to determine carbon and neutron - capture enhancement frequencies , to better understand supernova nucleosynthesis and early universe chemical enrichment processes , and find new astrophysically interesting stars that merit further study .",
    "one star has already been identified as neutron - capture enhanced in our sample , based on its high eu abundance and another separate star has also been singled out . the latter star is a cemp star , with r - process and s - process elemental abundance enhancements .",
