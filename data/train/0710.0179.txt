    "einstein s wave - particle duality is arguably the most familiar phenomenon resulting from bohr s principle of complementarity .",
    "the intense debate between these two protagonists , of which bohr s essay on the occasion of einstein s 70th birthday is the best known public record @xcite , continues to be the object of scholarly studies @xcite , but there is , of course , rather wide - spread agreement by now on what used to be controversial issues then .    in the late 1920s and early 1930s , discussions of wave - particle duality focused on the extreme situations where only the particle aspects are present , or only the wave aspects . as natural",
    "as this focus may have been then , it does not do full justice to the subject , as it ignores the intermediate situations in which both aspects of an atomic system coexist within the boundaries that nature imposes by the laws of quantum mechanics .    the compromises that she permits are well understood in the context of two - path interferometers , where various inequalities quantify to which extent wave and particle properties can be observed simultaneously .",
    "the historical example of the bohr - einstein debate  einstein s version of young s double - slit interferometer , with a recoiling first single slit  is familiar textbook material , but its literal realization has not been achieved as yet .    what has become experimental reality , however , are analogous two - path interferometers of various kinds : for photons @xcite , neutrons @xcite , and atoms @xcite .",
    "they enable quantitative studies of wave - particle duality , in which the said inequalities are tested .",
    "as expected , it is consistently found that the inequalities are obeyed , not a single violation has been reported .",

    "@xmath0 quantifies the particle aspects : the _ a priori _ odds for guessing the path right are given by @xmath15 , and the _ visibility _ @xmath1 is simply the standard fringe visibility , the quantitative measure for the wave aspect .",
    "it is our primary objective in this paper to introduce , and discuss , the generalization to multi - path interferometers , with a particular emphasis on three - path interferometers where most features are already present in their generic forms . to this end",
    ", we shall not employ drr s strategy of ref .  , who aimed at generalizations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 such that the equal sign in ( [ eq : p+v - bit ] ) continues to apply for all pure states propagating through an @xmath16-path interferometer , as it does for two - path interferometers .",
    "rather , we consider a few possible choices for a generalization of @xmath0 that suggest themselves and identify the corresponding generalization of @xmath1 in , so we think , a natural way .",

    "we have already mentioned drr s work @xcite , which is quite substantial , and an earlier discussion , rather brief and with no definite conclusions , is contained in ref .  .",
    "we explore suggestions for generalizing @xmath0 from both .",
    "by contrast , the recent approach by luis @xcite , who is motivated by the experiment of ref .  , does not fit into our strategy ; put tersely , he is concerned with `` this - path information '' whereas we care for `` which - path information . ''    here",
    "is a brief outline . after presenting our general strategy in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] , we illustrate matters in the simple situation of two - path interferometers in sec .",

    "[ sec : quarts ] .",
    "we close with a summary .",
    "the two stages of a @xmath16-path interferometer : preparation stage and probing stage , and the two modes of operation : particle mode and wave mode .",
    "* left side : * at the preparation stage , the incoming intensity ( usually only one input port is used ) is distributed over all paths by a `` generalized beam splitter '' or _",
    "itter _ , which is the @xmath16-port version of the entry beam splitter of the common two - path interferometers .",
    "a symmetric nitter is unbiased and assigns equal intensity to all paths ( analogous to a symmetric 50:50 beam splitter ) , but it is more general to allow for a biased transformation ( an asymmetric beam splitter in the case of @xmath17 ) , so that the intensity may vary from one path to the next . * right side :  ( a ) * in _ particle mode _ ( top ) , the probing just amounts to detecting the path , a click of detector d@xmath18 indicating that the @xmath19th path was the case . * ( b ) *  in _ wave mode _ ( bottom ) , the probing stage uses a fourier transformation , that is : a symmetric nitter , in front of the detectors , so that all paths contribute equally to the intensity in each of the @xmath16 output ports . in principle",
    ", any arbitrary fourier transformation is to be considered , but in practice a suitably chosen set of @xmath16 transformations suffice , each characterized by the values of the relative phases between the amplitudes of the paths .",
    "the differences in the probabilities that the various detectors d@xmath20 , d@xmath21 ,  , d@xmath22 respond result only from these relative phases . taken together , the probabilities constitute the potentially complicated interference pattern , in their dependence on those relative phases . ]",
    "in the most general terms , a @xmath16-path interferometer consists of an initial preparation stage and a final probing stage , see fig .",
    "[ fig : npaths ] .",
    "it is convenient to describe the state of the interfering system between the stages by a @xmath23 density matrix , @xmath24 of course , the diagonal entries @xmath25 , @xmath26 ,  , @xmath27 are the probabilities of finding the system in the 1st , 2nd ,  , @xmath16th path , respectively .",

    "this gives a unique central fourier matrix , @xmath53 and for @xmath54 there are two possible central fourier matrices , @xmath55 but these two are equivalent for our purposes because they differ only by a permutation of rows , that is : of the output channels , which can be compensated for by a relabeling of the detectors in fig .",

    "the fourier matrix of ( [ eq : a4 ] ) corresponds to @xmath58 , and @xmath59 in conjunction with permuting the 2nd and 3rd rows gives the tensor product of the @xmath60 matrix in ( [ eq : f3 ] ) with itself .    for @xmath61 ,",
    "the situation is similar to that for @xmath54 , as there is essentially only one central fourier matrix , the standard one of ( [ eq : a4 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is not true for other prime values of @xmath16 .",
    "for example , there are five inequivalent choices for @xmath62 . and for composite values of @xmath16 , we have continuous families of central fourier matrices , is illustrated above for @xmath63 ; more about this at the website of ref .  .",
    "our choice of terminology to refer to all matrices with the property ( [ eq : a3 ] ) as _ fourier matrices _ is not everybody s convention .",

    "[ sec : intermodes ] . in this context one usually encounters fourier transformations , and this prompted our choice of terminology .",

    "@xmath78 the amount won should be the larger , the fewer guesses you need , and a random guess should have a neutral over - all return .",
    "these natural requirements impose the restrictions @xmath79    the optimal betting strategy is clearly to first bet on the most likely path , then on the second likely , and so on . on average , the gain is then @xmath80 where the @xmath81s are the @xmath70s in descending order , @xmath82 by construction , @xmath83 meets the criteria ( [ eq : a8]a  e ) , and so @xmath83 is an acceptable numerical measure of path knowledge .",

    ", we consider drr s proposal of ref .  , who constructs a path - knowledge function @xmath77 from the so - called `` purity '' of the probability distribution , essentially the sum of the squared path probabilities .",
