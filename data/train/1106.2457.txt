    "decoherence conspires against this objective as it leads to progressive and smooth destruction of the quantum interferences @xcite within a  characteristic time @xmath0 the main source of decoherence for solid - state spin systems such as quantum dots @xcite , donors in silicon @xcite , defects in diamond @xcite , and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite is the uncontrolled spin bath environment . while one can attempt different strategies such as quantum error correction protocols @xcite and dynamical decoupling @xcite , their specific efficiency depends on a deep understanding of how the environment behaves .",
    "thus , understanding and mitigation of decoherence is one of the current challenges for quantum science and technology @xcite .",
    "the interaction rate @xmath1 between a quantum system @xmath2 and its environment @xmath3 is typically evaluated from a fermi golden rule ( fgr ) , which assumes that the environment has a markovian nature .",
    "also , the interplay between the system time scales ( e.g. @xmath4 ) and that of the interaction ( @xmath5 ) could result in striking effects . while weak interactions ( @xmath6 ) simply degrade dynamical interferences at a rate @xmath7 , stronger ones may change the system s response radically , leading to a quantum dynamical phase transition in its dependence on @xmath1 @xcite . indeed , the possibility of a non - analytic behavior , e.g. in the energy spectrum @xcite , appears because the system s effective hamiltonian is non - hermitian @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , can be traced back to the fact that the environment has a number of degrees of freedom @xmath8 which can be considered infinite . as p.w .",
    "anderson put forth : more is different ,  and new physical phenomena may appear when this thermodynamic limit ( @xmath9 ) is properly taken @xcite .",
    "indeed , there are several models of both non - markovian and markovian environments @xcite which show this dynamical phase transition as a function of the interaction strength .    * *  * * while the markovian approximation is sufficient for most traditional applications , it leaves aside important memory effects and interferences in the time domain .",
    "these result from the coherent interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and are becoming a topic of increasing interest @xcite .",
    "the system - environment dynamics may go through different temporal regimes : a quadratic decay at very short times yields to the usual exponential fgr decay and much later it is transformed into an inverse power law decay ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", we will focus on the more relevant exponential regime , treated both with the fgr and with a self - consistent ( sc ) fgr which accounts for bath memory effects . once again , a deep understanding of the environment s dynamics is central to identify the different regimes and to foresee possible dynamical transitions .    a natural way to quantify",
    "the decoherence time @xmath10 is through the degradation of specific interferences , e.g. rabi oscillations @xcite or mesoscopic echoes @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the implementation of a time reversal procedure , the loschmidt echo ( le ) @xcite , allows the evaluation of the decoherence time by measuring the reversibility of the system s dynamics in presence of an uncontrolled environment .",
    "the le can be accessed experimentally in spin systems @xcite , confined atoms @xcite , microwave excitations @xcite , etc . , and has become a powerful tool for quantifying decoherence , stability and complexity in dynamical processes in several physical situations @xcite .    in this article",
    "we have the aim to quantify the role of bath s memory as well as specific correlations in the @xmath11 interaction on decoherence . with this purpose , we consider the evolution of two coupled spins in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 configurations in the presence of different spin environments with a fully characterized coherent dynamics @xcite .",
    "the system s rabi oscillations @xcite can act as a swap gate , and after appropriate mappings , this boils down to an excitation that jumps between two degenerate states @xmath14 and @xmath15 with a rate determined by the coupling `` constant '' @xmath16 , which can be switched at will . starting on state @xmath14 , the return probability oscillates with @xmath17 , the rabi frequency . in order to understand the incidence of environmental memory effects in the rate @xmath18 , we must consider the relation between the system s time scale ( typically ruled by @xmath19 ) and the bath s inner excitation spreading time scale as determined by the density of directly connected states @xmath20 , which , in general , is just a local density of states ( ldos ) @xcite",
    ". also important is the specific form in which the system couples to the bath : each site may be coupled to a different environment ( private bath ) or both sites could share the same environment ( public bath ) , and this would allow different correlations .",
    "a quantitative comparison between rates in these cases will enable a qualitative interpretation in terms of the bath s spectral structure and the effects of public and private @xmath11 interactions .",
    "this should deepen our understanding about how the involved correlations modify the degradation rate @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , if the system s and the bath s time scales are similar , the problem can not be treated within the markovian paradigm of a slow variable interacting with a fast equilibrating background .",
    "it requires to be carefully addressed beyond the fgr .",
    "the appearance of mechanisms of correlated coupling in public environments has been previously pointed in the literature of open quantum systems , particularly in terms of the spin - boson models @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite , at least for a simple model of a @xmath21qubit register , that the decoherence increases linearly with @xmath8 for independent reservoirs , while it grows with the square @xmath22 for a collective environment .",
    "this suggests that such a public interaction may lead to a strong amplification of decoherence . on the other hand",
    ", it has been pointed in the literature of error correction protocols that symmetric ( public ) @xmath11 coupling can be exploited to design states that are hardly corrupted by such a coherent environmental noise @xcite . also , in recent years the role of a common environment in the entanglement correlations within a system @xcite , and the possibility of creating and manipulating those correlations by environment - mediated interactions @xcite have been explored .",
    "it is important to notice that spectral correlations within the bath , as described above , may become quite cumbersome to describe in statistical terms .",
    "however , realistic hamiltonian models of the bath , as proposed here , should allow a simple and natural description of such correlations .",
    "thus , the cases we analyze here can be casted directly into 1-d spin systems interacting by means of a planar ( @xmath23 or flip - flop ) or as chains of spins interacting with a double - quantum ( flip - flip / flop - flop ) effective hamiltonians . indeed ,",
    "the spin - fermion mapping provided by the jordan - wigner transformation ( jwt ) @xcite has been successfully exploited to predict spin polarization dynamics in linear chains and rings @xcite and results in full agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it allowed addressing polarization spin dynamics in homogeneous chains @xcite and dynamics of multiple spin coherences @xcite by mapping them to fermionic excitations . in both cases ,",
    "the local excitation is identified with a single fermion propagating in a tight - binding linear chain , and one can assume that the environment is described by an identical chain . additionally , the dynamics of a tight - binding model can be mapped , sometimes quite straightforwardly , to describe the propagation of excitations in several scenarios like classical and quantum coupled oscillators @xcite , plasmonic wave guides @xcite , sound propagation @xcite , spin - boson interactions and other models used for decoherence in quantum information @xcite .",
    "a fundamental issue about integrability of the chosen models is that they enable analytical expressions valid in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of spins .",
    "in fact , an analytically tractable bath means the capability to sum up an otherwise divergent perturbation series into a complex self - energy through the dyson equation , which only then is considered in the fgr approximation . additionally , having a smooth ldos , which arises from a continuous spectrum ( @xmath24 ) , avoids spurious resonances that might appear in finite systems . besides",
    ", we will see that a well defined curvature of the ldos will be central to quantify the corrections to the fgr .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : numerical - analytical - tools ] , the notions of survival probability and local loschmidt echo are presented on the face of their numerical implementation .",
    "we deal analytically with every case by working with the exact green s function in each case .",
    "further details related to the gf s poles are discussed in appendix [ apendice-2 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the analytical decay rates obtained with the fgr and the sc - fgr are presented for each case under consideration .",
    "these rates are compared with those computed numerically from the dynamics , contrasting the results of the survival probability ( sp ) and the loschmidt echo ( le ) of the local excitation .",
    "all these magnitudes are analyzed under the light of the knowledge of the environment memory effects as provided by its spectral structure ( ldos ) . in the last section ,",
    "further discussions and conclusions are presented to argue how the public bath is more effective to distort the decay process away from the usual fermi golden rule ( energy independent rate ) .",
    "as pointed above , while our motivation lies mainly on spin dynamics under flip - flop interactions , we use the spin - fermion mapping to cast it in terms of tight - binding models that apply to a wide variety of systems .",
    "thus , we leave to appendix [ apendice-1 ] a brief outline of how this mapping is achieved . here",
    ", we present the models and analyze them in terms of straightforward single particle physics .",
    "these are basically variations of tight - binding infinite linear chains where the bath s memory can be fully characterized . of course , the cases where the interactions network topology has branching points or loops would preclude the simple back transformation into spin systems .",

    "it is crucial to stress that @xmath47  @xmath48  and @xmath49  determine the relevant time scales of the whole problem .",
    "the first two give the rate of hopping from site @xmath14 to site @xmath15 and to the environment , respectively .",
    "the third is the jumping rate between sites in the environment .",
    "an irreversible  decay to the environment , and hence the fermi golden rule , implies that the unperturbed isolated system state has zero overlap with eigenstates of @xmath50  for this perturbation theory break down , the interaction with each environment eigenstate , @xmath51 must be much greater than the spacing between adjacent levels , of about @xmath52 i.e. the interaction time scale @xmath53 must be lower than the environment s heisenberg time @xmath54 . imposing @xmath55 for all the cases we treated ( weak coupling regime ) ,",
    "we ensure the smooth degradation of the system s coherent evolution .",
    "when @xmath56 the memory effects characterizing a _ non - markovian _ situation lead to a very rich dynamical behavior . in the opposite limit , if @xmath57 then the validity of the fgr ( _ markovian _ situation ) is expected to be recovered .",
    "typically , this last situation will be represented in this work by a hopping @xmath58 .",
    "two kind of measures for dynamical degradation are employed in this work : the survival probability ( sp ) @xmath59 and the local loschmidt echo .",
    "the sp is defined as @xmath60   \\left\\vert a\\right\\rangle \\theta(t)\\right\\vert ^{2},\\label{s7}%\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the heaviside step function , and the hamiltonian @xmath62 is defined by eq .",
    "it measures the probability of finding a particle in site @xmath14 at time @xmath63 , provided that the system has had a particle in the same site at time @xmath64 . in spin systems",
    ", this is a spin autocorrelation function ( see eq .",
    "[ s1 ] and [ s6 ] in appendix [ apendice-1 ] ) .",
    "the whole evolution of the system as reflected in the sp , is affected by a decay process , which is not trivial to separate from the intrinsic dynamics .",
    "thus , to quantify decoherence , one relies on the observation of specific features as natural recurrences ( rabi oscillations or mesoscopic echoes ) that appear at specific times .",
    "this limits the used time windows and limits the detailed assessment of @xmath11 dynamics .",
    "although it is not the perfect tool to quantify the effects of the environment , the sp behaves as a probe that reflects the overall dynamical process .    with the purpose of",
    "get a continuous access to the @xmath11 dynamics that better reflects the environmental memory effects , we focus our attention on the le .",
    "this measure has been used in the last years in different physical scenarios ( both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite ) in order to explain the behavior of the decoherence characteristic time . in general , the le provides a direct measure of the decoherence process due to the environment , and even though it depends on the nature of the system s intrinsic dynamics , it does not depend much on its details .",
    "its usual dynamical behavior presents an exponential decay regime @xcite , which will be used to characterize the destruction of the system s coherent dynamics .",
    "the le relies on the time reversal of the system s evolution and , in the present scenario , it has a direct physical interpretation .",
    "the le can be understood as the measure of the amount of polarization returned to _",
    "_  local _ _ site where it started .",
    "the controlled quantum dynamics is separated in two stages .",
    "first , the initial local excitation ( particle in site @xmath14 ) evolves during a time @xmath65 , and then a time reversal procedure is applied during a period time ( @xmath66 ) which reverses the system s dynamics ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the bath s dynamics and the @xmath11 interactions ( @xmath68 and @xmath40 respectively ) remain unreversed during the backward evolution .",
    "this partial control results in a non - reversed perturbation @xmath69 acting in both periods . finally , the probability of finding the particle in site @xmath14 forms a loschmidt echo provided that @xmath70 : @xmath71   \\exp\\left [ -\\mathrm{i}(\\hat{h}_{\\mathcal{s}}+\\hat{\\sigma})t_{1}/\\hbar\\right ]   \\left\\vert a\\right\\rangle \\right\\vert ^{2}.\\label{s8}%\\ ] ] clearly , in the case where the system is isolated , the local le will have a steady value of @xmath38 .",
    "this means that the system is fully reversible . on the other hand ,",
    "if the system is coupled to the infinite and continuous environment s spectrum , both the forward and backward effective hamiltonians , @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively , become non - hermitian .",
    "thus , the le decays with a characteristic rate , i.e. , our reversal procedure has not been able to recover the excitation spread to the environment .",
    "the net decay of the norm of the state simply means the decay of the coherent part and then describes the non - trivial part of the loschmidt echo .    for both survival probability and loschmidt echo evaluation , we diagonalize the hamiltonian to obtain the evolution for every time .",
    "we use sufficiently large chains to approximate the nature of infinite ones .",
    "indeed , the evolution times considered in this work are short enough to ensure the absence of dynamical finite - size effects ( e.g. mesoscopic echoes appearing at the environment s heisenberg time ) .",
    "a typical system is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig sp and llm]-*a * ( the same model was deeply analyzed in ref .",

    "however , one should be aware that for an arbitrary system , the sp envelope does not necessarily match the local le ( the characteristic rates can be different ) .",

    "thus the sp and the local le are not equivalent ( see table [ tabla-1 ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the asymmetry ( dependence on the relative sign ) in the rates for the forward and backward evolutions , arises only when the bath is public .",

    "moreover , and quite obviously , the _ forward _ rate agrees with the sp decay .",
    "let us now link the decay process to an appropriate ldos . as it is clearly shown in appendix [ apendice-2",

    "@xcite ) . since the initial condition has equal weight on both effective chains , the corresponding rates for them have to be added .",
    "further details on the symmetrization transformation are explained in appendix [ apendice-2 ] .",

    "[ fig 5 sitios ] ) .",
    "this case is of interest for studying spin dynamics in ring and ladder like systems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "+    in this system we will consider three different relation for time scales : @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( we also assume @xmath139 ) .",
    "for these cases the decay rates ( local le degradation rate measured in units of @xmath77 ) computed by the numerical solution are @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we observe that the first two results do not match with that expected by wba . moreover , as we have seen before , the convexity of the bulk ldos , induce bigger values . by setting @xmath138 ( approximately one order of magnitude of difference ) we are near the wba validity and",
    "thus nearly reproduce the expected result : an energy independent rate , of value @xmath143 @xmath77 , in accordance to eq .",
    "we stress here that the strong sensibility on the relation between time scales , is enhanced by a highly public @xmath11 interaction .",
    "traditionally , the first approach to evaluate decay rates is the fgr based on an underlying wba .",
    "we have shown several variations of a simple swap gate interacting with an environment ( or several ones ) where this scheme is not as good as one might assume .",
    "this failure , which can be understood as non - markovianity , is due to two contributions ( which should not be considered as well separated effects ) .",
    "first , if the wba limit ( @xmath57 ) is not well fulfilled , then it is quite obvious that the energy independent rate will not be representative as it would oversimplify the decay process .",
    "when the system s time scale becomes comparable to that of the environment ( i.e. @xmath144 , non - markovian situation ) , the decay rate departs from the usual fgr approximation evaluated at single energy level .",
    "depending on the bath s spectral structure ( ldos ) the actual rate can be greater or lower .",
    "we have shown that if the ldos is a convex function of the energy , then any shift away from the middle of the band spectrum will produce a greater decay rate .",
    "but if the ldos is a concave energy function , the rate would be lower .",
    "in general , we have seen that dynamical complexity ( understood as how much the decay departs from the wba validity ) arises when the time scales of the system , the environment and the @xmath11 interactions , are commensurable .",
    "second , when the dynamics is non - markovian due to similar time scales , the possibility of interaction through the environment becomes appreciable . in a public bath ,",
    "the correlations generated by the multiple connections between different parts of the system and the bath , are more effective to depart the physical process away from the wba validity , for a given relation of time scales .",
    "in general this leads to too subtle correlations to be treated in spectral models for the bath which here becomes quite natural through the use of specific hamiltonian models of the environment . in order to address the question on the private and public nature of the @xmath11 interaction , we confront the cases of _ two independent baths _ ( case @xmath124 ) and _ one common bath _ ( case @xmath120 ) . in cases where @xmath11 interaction is private",
    "there is no dependence of the rate on the relative sign of @xmath49 and @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath11 interaction is public , the forward and backward evolution will change the decay rates and will produce a mean value for the local le decoherence rate .",
    "it is important to stress here that we are comparing cases where @xmath2 and @xmath3  have similar time scales . in this condition",
    ", it is observed that decay rates for the public case are greater than for the private . in this sense",
    "we interpret ( at least for this cases ) that the private bath is less harmful than a public one . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is a consequence of moving along the ldos in the _ effective _ fgr ( see figs . [ fig - ldos ] and [ public_ldos ] ) .",
    "a public scenario produces an enhancement in the alteration of the fgr away from the wba limit , as compared to the private one . as a matter of fact , private bath is less efficient for correlated memory - like returns to the system . as it has been previously stated in a general sense , and based on complete formal grounds , the feedback of information from @xmath3 to @xmath2 is the central issue for quantifying a non - markovian bath @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown how markovianity is restored by changing the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 time scales .",
    "in fact , for all the cases treated in this work , we have found that once we move towards the wba limit ( represented by a bath dynamics 5 times faster than the system s ) , the effects of a public or private bath are no longer relevant .",
    "for both cases the environment is fast enough to wash out all the memory effects , since any inner excitation is rapidly spread . at this point",
    "the rate for both situations become equal and agree with the one predicted by the common fgr .",
    "this means that when the system s and the bath s time scales are well differentiated ( specifically when the bath s is very short as compared to the system s ) , then the public - private reservoir discussion becomes irrelevant . in many physical situations , when addressing 1-d and 1-d@xmath145  systems ( see , for example @xcite ) , a coupled environment behaves with a convex ldos .",
    "therefore , memory effects and complexity in the structure of the @xmath11 interaction produce an enhancement of the coherent dynamics degradation .",
    "additionally , we stress here the wider `` spectral exploration '' of the loschmidt echo as compared to the survival probability ( a difference clearly shown in the public @xmath11 interaction case , where the global le rate is a mean value of two non symmetric processes ) .",
    "even though we do not claim full generality for the results discussed here , there are some interesting universal issues to remark .",
    "the use of the wide band approximation ( simple fgr ) can easily lead to quantitative and qualitative errors if the time scales and the physical structure of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are similar .",
    "furthermore , the way they are coupled to each other ( _ public _ or _ private _ ) , plays a fundamental role .",
    "in general , dynamical complexity grows when those characteristic times are similar and when there is no privacy in the @xmath11 interaction .",

    "we briefly present here the spin - fermion mapping , and how the tight binding models discussed along the present article arise .",

    "<S> the way in which a two level system is coupled to different environments is specifically addressed : multiple connections to a single bath ( public environment ) or single connections to multiple baths ( private environments ) . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically evaluate the decay rate of a local excitation by using the survival probability and the loschmidt echo . </S>",
    "<S> these rates are compared to analytical results obtained from the standard fermi golden rule ( fgr ) in wide band approximation , and a self - consistent evaluation that accounts for the bath s memory in cases where an exact analytical solution is possible . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the correlations appearing in a public bath introduce further deviations from the fgr as compared with a private bath . </S>"
