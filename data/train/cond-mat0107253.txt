    "it is also surprisingly low compared to that of the metals that composed them . from a theoretical point of view , the influence of quasiperiodicity on the spectral and dynamical properties of electron systems has been the subject of many studies . for independent electrons systems",
    ", it has been shown that the eigenstates , which are neither localized nor extended but critical ( algebraic decay ) , are responsible of an anomalous quantum diffusion in any dimension . concerning the nature of the spectrum , it depends on the dimensionality but also exhibits specific characteristics of the quasiperiodicity .",
    "more precisely , in one dimension , the spectrum of quasiperiodic systems , such as the fibonacci or the harper chain , is made up of an infinite number of zero width bands ( singular continuous ) whereas in higher dimensions , it can be either absolutely continuous ( band - like ) , singular continuous , or any mixture .",
    "these features are a direct consequence of the long - range order present in these structures despite the lack of periodicity .",
    "this absence of translational invariance makes any analytical approach difficult and one must often have recourse to numerical diagonalization , except in a perturbative framework@xcite .",
    "given the complexity of the independent electron problem , the influence of a quasiperiodic modulation on an interacting system is very difficult to tackle .",
    "attempts to solve this problem have been mostly confined to mean field solutions@xcite or numerical diagonalizations @xcite .",
    "we have recently proposed @xcite a different route , already used with success for periodic @xcite and disordered systems@xcite .",
    "the main idea of this method is to first solve the _ periodic _ system in presence of interactions  ; this is relatively easy , either in the one - dimensional case for which technique to treat interactions exists@xcite , or even in higher dimensions through approximate ( fermi liquid ) solutions . in a second step ,",
    "we study the effect of a perturbative quasiperiodic potential via a renormalization group approach .",
    "several types of quasiperiodic potentials can in principle be studied by this approach but the most interesting effects come from quasiperiodic potentials which have a non trivial fourier spectrum .",
    "indeed other potentials such as the harper model@xcite who have only a single harmonic in their fourier spectrum are perturbatively equivalent to periodic systems @xcite .",
    "we have used our rg approach to treat interacting spinless fermions in the presence of a fibonacci potential@xcite .",
    "we have shown that the existence of arbitrarily small peaks in the fourier spectrum ( opening arbitrarily small gaps at first order in perturbation ) leads to a vanishing critical interaction below which the system is conducting .",
    "this novel metal - insulator transition ( mit ) has very different characteristics from those observed in periodic and disordered systems for which a finite attractive interaction is required .",
    "these predictions have been successfully confirmed by numerical calculations@xcite .",
    "similar renormalization techniques have been also used in a variety of cases @xcite .",
    "even if some of these properties are specific to one - dimensional potentials , these results should provide a first step toward the understanding of higher dimensional interacting system in quasiperiodic structures .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend this study to quasiperiodic potentials that generalize the fibonacci potential .",
    "we show that the critical properties obtained in the fibonacci case@xcite are generic of other self - similar systems .",
    "our results are in agreement with the recent numerical results obtained on precious mean potentials@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows  : in section  [ the_model ] , we present the model on the lattice and derive its continuous version for any potential using a bosonization technique .",
    "we detail the renormalization group treatment of the bosonized model and the computation of the flow equations for the coupling constants . in section  [ critical_properties ] , we recall the results for the well - known mott transition ( periodic case ) and we describe the physics of the disordered case for which a different kind of mit occurs .",
    "we then discuss the most interesting situation  : the quasiperiodic case .",
    "we explain why the non trivial self - similar fourier spectrum induces a mit whose characteristics are intermediate between the periodic and the disordered potentials .",

    "thus , for @xmath65 , the potential @xmath10 is irrelevant , and the system remains a gapless luttinger liquid . for @xmath66 , the potential is relevant and the system flows to strong coupling regime .",

    "the strong coupling fixed point is elusive so we can make only educated guesses . in the noninteracting case ( @xmath64 ) for a point of the spectrum , the correlation functions decay as a power - law .",
    "it is thus unlikely that for the interacting case the strong coupling regime has a characteristic lengthscale in a similar way than the commensurate or disordered system .",
    "thus the most likely possibility is that for the quasiperiodic case the length @xmath177 separates , two power - law regimes with different exponents . since for the noninteracting quasiperiodic case , contrarily to the disordered case ,",
    "the correlation functions are still power - law , interactions are likely to still play a role even in the strong coupling regime",

    "fortunately , one can still estimate qualitatively the behavior of some of the quantities .",
    "for instance , concerning the spectrum one expects , as the interaction becomes attractive ( or equivalently as the luttinger parameter reached @xmath183 ) , that the smallest gaps start closing until @xmath178 where all gaps are closed .",
    "similarly for the temperature dependence of the conductivity one expects below the crossover scale @xmath162 , a power - law dependence of the conductivity . it would be interesting to check the above proposals in the numerical solutions , both for spinless @xcite and spinfull @xcite systems",
    "more generally , the extension of these investigations to other types of potentials such as the prouet - thue - morse or the paper - folding potentials @xcite would be very useful since they also display a complex ( dense ) fourier spectrum .",

    "it would be interesting to carry on the same type of memory matrix approximation for the quasiperiodic case .",
    "second , it would be interesting to know if a correlated disorder could induce the same type of mit as the one encountered here for the quasiperiodic system .",
    "indeed , this type of disorder is susceptible to also produce a non trivial fourier spectrum and thus to have a critical @xmath21 that depends explicitely on @xmath85 .    to conclude , we address the question of experimental realizations to directly observe these effects",
