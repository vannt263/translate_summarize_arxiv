    "unconventional superconductivity , the electronic analog of superfluidity in @xmath2he , was discovered in the heavy - fermion metals ube@xmath3 and upt@xmath0 more than a decade ago.@xcite as in liquid @xmath2he the observation of multiple superconducting phases was the direct evidence for a multi - component superconducting order parameter.@xcite the phases of upt@xmath0 have since become a paradigm for unconventional superconductivity .",
    "however , unlike the case of @xmath2he the identification of the orbital and spin symmetry of the order parameter has been a more difficult task .",
    "heavy fermion metals are more complex materials in which disorder , magnetism , spin - orbit coupling and anisotropy must be factored into any realistic theory of superconductivity in these systems ( c.f .",
    "refs .  ) .    in this paper",
    "we present new theoretical results and analysis of the transport properties of the leading models for the superconducting phases of upt@xmath0 .",
    "these models yield qualitatively different predictions for the transport properties in the superconducting phases .",
    "we calculate the ultrasonic attenuation for the a and b phases and discuss its sensitivity to order parameter symmetry , polarization direction and disorder . from our analysis of experimental data for the heat capacity,@xcite thermal conductivity@xcite and transverse sound attenuation@xcite",
    "we determine the topology of the excitation gap on the fermi surface and conclude that the orbital symmetry of the order parameter in the a and b phases of upt@xmath0 belongs to an odd - parity e@xmath1 representation .",
    "the discoveries of multiple superconducting phases@xcite of upt@xmath0 led to several theoretical models for the superconducting phase diagram based on different symmetry groups , or symmetry breaking scenarios.@xcite one class of models is based on a two - dimensional ( `` e '' ) representation of the hexagonal point group , @xmath4 , with the multi - component superconducting order parameter coupled to a _ symmetry breaking field _ ( sbf ) . there are four e - representations for strong spin - orbit coupling : two e - reps for both even - parity ( e@xmath5 , e@xmath6 ) and odd - parity ( e@xmath7 , e@xmath1 ) pairing .",
    "the e - rep models require a weak sbf that lowers the symmetry of the normal state , splits the superconducting transition and produces multiple superconducting phases.@xcite the sbf is generally assumed to be the in - plane antiferromagnetic order parameter that onsets at @xmath8;@xcite however , other explanations of the sbf have been suggested.@xcite the precise structure of the short - range afm correlations , e.g. the spatial structure of domains , as well as the role of afm as a sbf for superconductivity is still an open question.@xcite one of the outcomes of the calculations summarized below is that simple model of equal - size , equally populated multi - domain structures for the sbf is in disagreement with the anisotropy of the sound attenuation .",
    "the models that have been most successful in explaining the properties of the superconducting phases of upt@xmath0 are based on the even - parity ( e@xmath5 ) and the odd - parity ( e@xmath1 ) representations of the hexagonal point group .",
    "the e@xmath5 representation is a realization of spin - singlet , d - wave pairing for a metal with a uniaxial symmetry , while the e@xmath1 model describes the hexagonal analog of spin - triplet , f - wave pairing .",
    "these pairing states have an orbital order parameter of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the basis functions for the appropriate e - representation , and the amplitudes @xmath11 transform as a two - component ` vector ' under the same e - representation .",
    "thus , in the e - representations the order parameter of the a phase is identified as @xmath12 , the b phase as @xmath13 , and the c phase as @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ) .",
    "these identifications then refer to the specific basis functions , @xmath10 , for a particular e - representation given in table  [ op_reps ] .",
    "the orbital order parameter differs significantly for the two models , particularly for the high temperature a phase @xmath15 . for e@xmath5 pairing",
    "the a phase has the structure , @xmath16 , which has an equatorial line node in the basal plane , as well as a longitudinal line node circumscribing the fermi surface . for the e@xmath1 representation",
    ", @xmath17 also has an equatorial line node , but has _ two _ longitudinal line nodes oriented @xmath18 degrees to one another .",
    "the low - temperature b phase of both models breaks time - reversal symmetry ( with @xmath19 ) . as a result",
    "the longitudinal line nodes are closed by the growth of the second component of the order parameter ; and for @xmath20 , @xmath21 for e@xmath5 symmetry , while @xmath22 for the e@xmath1 representation .",
    "thus , the low energy excitation spectra for the b phase of the e@xmath5 and e@xmath1 models is described by an equatorial line of zero energy excitations ( @xmath23 ) and pairs of point nodes of the excitation gap ( @xmath24 ) on the fermi surface .",
    "there is a slight difference in the density of states from the point nodes because the gap varies linearly near the point nodes for the e@xmath5 model , @xmath25 , but quadratically for the e@xmath1 model , @xmath26 .",
    "these slight differences are predicted to be observable in the heat transport at ultra - low temperatures.@xcite    all of the e - rep models are based on two - component orbital order parameters .",
    "however , they yield different predictions for the thermodynamic , magnetic and transport properties , including the h - t phase diagram .",
    "one important difference arises for the case of weak in - plane hexagonal anisotropy , as is reflected by the very small in - plane anisotropy of @xmath27.@xcite weak in - plane anisotropy leads to an apparent tetracritical point for all field orientations provided the order parameter belongs to an e@xmath28 orbital representation.@xcite    a key difference between the even - parity and odd - parity e - representations is the spin structure of the order parameter .",
    "odd - parity representations are spin - triplet pairing states , and in the absence of spin - orbit coupling the dimensionality of these representations is three times larger than that of the corresponding spin - singlet e - representations .",
    "however , strong spin - orbit coupling in the uranium - based heavy fermion metals reduces the symmetry group by allowing only joint rotations of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the even and odd parity representations are still described by ( pseudo ) spin - singlet and spin - triplet order parameters of the form@xcite @xmath29 the triplet representations transform only under _ joint _ spin and orbital rotations of the discrete point group for the normal state , i.e. , @xmath30 , where the rotation @xmath31_{\\mbox{\\tiny spin - orbit}}$ ] .",

    "there are two special classes of spin - triplet order parameters that are frequently discussed as candidates for the phases of upt@xmath0 .",
    "the first class are states in which the spin - triplet order parameter factorizes into a single spin - vector and an orbital amplitude , i.e. , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a real unit vector and @xmath44 is an odd - parity orbital function . the vector @xmath43 defines the axis along which the pairs have zero spin projection , e.g. , if @xmath45 then @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "if we choose the quantization axis to be perpendicular to @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath48 , then the same pairing state is described as _",
    "equal spin pairing _ in an `` easy - plane '' , i.e. , the pairs form triplet states with amplitudes @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the second class",
    ", @xmath43 is complex and the spin components of the order parameter spontaneously break time - reversal symmetry . in the general case",
    "@xmath51 is complex , with @xmath52 , and varies over the fermi surface .",
    "these states are called ` non - unitary ' because the square of the spin - matrix representation of the order parameter is no longer proportional to the unit spin matrix , @xmath53_{\\alpha\\beta } =   \\left|{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\delta$}}\\right|^2\\,\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta }   + i\\left [    { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\delta$}}\\times{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\delta$}}^*\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}\\right]_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] . as a consequence",
    "the spin degeneracy of the excitation spectrum is lifted and the quasiparticle energy depends on the local pair spin at @xmath37 : @xmath54 .    whether or not spin - orbit coupling is weak or strong on the energy scale of @xmath55 has important implications for both the orbital and spin components of the order parameter that are allowed by symmetry .",
    "blount@xcite and volovik and gorkov@xcite showed that line nodes are _ not required _ for odd - parity states when spin - orbit coupling is relevant .",
    "however , line nodes in the @xmath56-plane of the fermi surface are allowed , and required for some representations , the normal - state spin - orbit interactions lock @xmath43 along the @xmath57 axis of the crystal , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "precisely this orientation of @xmath43 was predicted@xcite for upt@xmath0 based on anisotropic paramagnetic limiting.@xcite this effect arises from the competition between the condensation energy and the zeeman energy .",
    "for @xmath43 locked along the @xmath57 axis of the lattice the zeeman energy is pair - breaking for @xmath59 , giving rise to paramagnetic limiting .",
    "however , for @xmath60 the zeeman energy , @xmath61 , is minimum ( vanishes ) ; as a result there is no paramagnetic limit for this field orientation .",
    "the anisotropic paramagnetic limiting of @xmath27 is sensitive to the spin structure of the order parameter , but insensitive to the orbital pairing symmetry.@xcite the odd - parity e@xmath1 representation with strong spin - orbit locking of @xmath62 quantitatively accounts for the anisotropy of the paramagnetic limit of @xmath27 observed at low temperatures .",
    "the spin - singlet e@xmath5 model appears to be incompatible with both the tetracritical point for @xmath63 and the anisotropic paramagnetic limiting of @xmath27 .",
    "however , park and joynt@xcite argue that there is enough freedom in the e@xmath5 model to account for the existing experimental data on @xmath27 .",
    "both e - rep models have recently been challenged by observations of a nearly temperature independent knight shift for @xmath59,@xcite which is interpreted in terms of non - unitary , spin - triplet pairing with weak , or no spin - orbit coupling.@xcite the authors of ref .",
    "assume that the knight shift measures the bulk spin susceptibility .",
    "if , for simplicity , we ignore the anisotropy of the normal - state susceptibility , then for a given orientation of @xmath43 the spin susceptibility is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the normal state spin susceptibility and @xmath66 is the spin susceptibility for @xmath67 , which is suppressed by pair - breaking and vanishes for @xmath20 in the clean limit . for strong spin - orbit coupling with @xmath43 locked along @xmath57",
    "we expect a suppression of the knight shift for @xmath68 for fields @xmath59 , but no suppression for @xmath60 .",
    "however , in the limit of no spin - orbit coupling the zeeman energy is minimized by _ rotation _ of @xmath43 perpendicular to the field .",
    "this implies that the knight shift will be temperature independent and given by the normal - state shift for all field orientations .",
    "the nmr measurements of the knight shift@xcite appear to be in conflict with anisotropic paramagnetic limiting of @xmath27 .",
    "the paramagnetic limit observed for @xmath69 is a robust , thermodynamic property of bulk single crystals of upt@xmath0 , and a consistent interpretation of the nmr results for the knight shift data must accommodate anisotropic paramagnetic limiting .",
    "this can not be accomplished with a model of spin - triplet pairing without strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "our analysis presented below for the heat capacity and transport measurements is independent of the interpretation of the knight shift measurements .",
    "we show that the heat capacity , low temperature thermal conductivity and transverse sound attenuation data , in addition to the h - t phase diagram , are in quantitative agreement _ only _ for the odd - parity e@xmath1 representation ( table [ op_reps ] ) , independent of the orientation of @xmath43 . in order to demonstrate this fact we present calculations for other models that have been proposed to account for the phase diagram .",
    "thus , in addition to the _",
    "2d _ e - representations we also examine the transport properties of the order parameter models belonging to mixed representations of the @xmath4 point group , i.e. , the ab models@xcite and the ae model.@xcite these models were proposed as alternatives to the e - representations to explain the ginzburg - landau region of the h - t phase diagram .",
    "the most promising candidate of the ab model is the odd parity , spin - triplet model with mixed a@xmath70b@xmath7 symmetry .",
    "the orbital order parameter for the a phase has the form , @xmath71 , exhibiting an equatorial line node and six longitudinal line nodes .",
    "we also analyze the transport properties of the even - parity , spin - singlet a@xmath72e@xmath5 model with an a phase of the form , @xmath73 , which has a pair of ` tropical ' line nodes located off the equatorial plane . for a more detailed description of the order parameter for these models",

    "the non - unitary , spin - triplet pairing states based on a one - dimensional ( _ 1d _ ) orbital representation studied so far,@xcite as well as the two - component order parameter models obtained from nearly degenerate one - dimensional representations@xcite ( ` ab models ' ) , are unable to describe , even qualitatively , the temperature dependence and anisotropy of the thermal conductivity at low temperatures .",
    "the only pairing models which can account for the thermal conductivity data are the two - dimensional ( _ 2d _ ) orbital representations , e@xmath5 and e@xmath1 , and the a@xmath72e@xmath5 ( ae ) model .",
