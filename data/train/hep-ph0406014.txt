    "one of the great challenges of modern particle physics and cosmology is to explain the excess of matter over anti - matter observed in the universe .",
    "this baryon asymmetry is conveniently expressed as the ratio of baryon minus anti - baryon density to the photon density and has recently been measured to a high degree of accuracy by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite combined with measurements of large scale structures of the universe @xcite : @xmath2 in a complete cosmological model this baryon asymmetry has to be dynamically generated during the evolution of the universe in the hot and dense phase shortly after the big bang .",
    "this is possible if the particle interactions violate baryon number ( @xmath3 ) , charge conjugation ( @xmath4 ) and the combined charge and parity conjugation ( @xmath1 ) , and if the expansion of the universe leads to a deviation from thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "all these ingredients are present in the standard model ( sm ) of particle interactions .",
    "however , the baryon asymmetry that can be generated in the sm falls far short of observations , i.e.  an extended model of particle interactions has to be considered .",
    "the observation of neutrino masses also requires an extension of the sm and lepton number ( @xmath5 ) violating interactions that are introduced in the seesaw model of neutrinos masses @xcite can naturally give rise to the observed baryon asymmetry in the leptogenesis scenario @xcite that is the topic of this article .",
    "the rather suprising fact that lepton number violating interactions can give rise to a baryon asymmetry is due to a deep connection between baryon and lepton number in the sm , as discussed in section [ blabla ] . in section [ basics ]",
    "we present the basic mechanism of leptogenesis and introduce some notations that are used in the following .",
    "the quantitative solution of the boltzmann equations and the corresponding bounds on light and heavy neutrino masses are described in section 4 .",
    "here we also comment on the _ leptogenesis conspiracy _ , the remarkable fact that neutrino masses may lie in the range where leptogenesis works best . in section 5 the connection between low and high energy @xmath1 violation and implications of leptogenesis for the heavy neutrino mass spectrum",
    "are briefly discussed .",
    "section 6 deals with the implications of leptogenesis for dark matter .",
    "in the sm both baryon and lepton number are classically conserved , since they are protected by global abelian symmetries . however , due to the chiral nature of weak interactions , these symmetries are anomalous and are violated at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "this is related to the non trivial vacuum structure of non - abelian gauge theories , like the sm . neglecting fermion masses ,",
    "there are an infinite number of degenerate ground states whose vacuum field configurations have different topological charges , or chern - simons numbers @xmath6 @xcite . in the electroweak sector of the sm a change in the topological charge , i.e.  a transition from one vacuum to another one , corresponds to a change in baryon and lepton numbers , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of generations of quarks and leptons , i.e.  @xmath9 in the sm .",
    "note that , although both baryon and lepton number are violated , the linear combination @xmath10 is still conserved at the quantum level .    at low temperatures ,",
    "when the electroweak symmetry is broken , the different vacua are separated by a potential barrier , whose height is determined by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field , @xmath11 , i.e.  the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "hence , processes changing the topological charge are tunneling processes whose rate is unobservably small , due to the smallness of the electroweak coupling constant . in the low temperature regime",
    "being probed at accelerator experiments , @xmath3 and @xmath5 are therefore conserved to a very good approximation , in accord with experimental observations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    when the standard model particles form a heat bath of temperature @xmath12 the situation changes . at high temperatures , @xmath13gev , the higgs vev ` evaporates ' , leading to a restoration of the electroweak symmetry and the disappearance of the potential barriers separating the different vacua . @xmath3 and @xmath5 violating transitions are then no longer suppressed @xcite .",
    "the rate at which these processes occur is related to the free energy of field configurations which carry topological charge . in the electroweak part of the sm",
    "these so - called sphaleron processes lead to an effective interaction of all left - handed fermions @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ fig_sphal ] ) , @xmath14 which indeed violates both baryon and lepton number by three units but conserves the combination @xmath10 , in accord with eq .",
    "( [ deltancs ] ) .",
    "the sphaleron transition rate in the symmetric phase of the sm has been evaluated by combining an analytical resummation with numerical lattice techniques @xcite .",
    "the result is that sphaleron processes are in thermal equilibrium for temperatures in the range @xmath15 these processes have a profound effect on the generation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry .",
    "( [ deltancs ] ) suggests that any @xmath16 asymmetry generated at temperatures @xmath17 , will be washed out .",
    "however , since only left - handed fields couple to sphalerons , a non - zero value of @xmath16 can persist in the high - temperature , symmetric phase if there exists a non - vanishing @xmath10 asymmetry .",
    "an analysis of the chemical potentials of all particle species in the high - temperature phase yields the following relation between the baryon asymmetry @xmath18 and the corresponding @xmath5 and @xmath10 asymmetries @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively @xcite , @xmath21 here @xmath22 is a number @xmath23 . in the sm with three generations and",
    "one higgs doublet one has @xmath24 .",
    "the deep connection between baryon and lepton number in the early universe has led to the realization that lepton number violating processes , whose presence is predicted by the seesaw model for light neutrino masses @xcite , can be responsible for the observed cosmological baryon asymmetry .    in the seesaw model",
    "the smallness of light neutrino masses is explained through the mixing of left - handed neutrinos with right - handed neutrinos @xmath25 which are not present in the sm but are predicted in certain models of grand unification .",
    "the interactions of the sm are supplemented by the following yukawa couplings of neutrinos , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the majorana mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos , and the yukawa couplings @xmath28 yield the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath29 after spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry . since the majorana mass matrix @xmath27 is independent of electroweak symmetry breaking , one can have @xmath30 , which leads to the mass eigenstates @xmath31 with heavy neutrino masses @xmath27 and the light neutrino masses @xmath32    the heavy neutrinos are unstable and decay through their yukawa couplings into sm lepton and higgs doublets . due to their majorana nature , the heavy neutrinos @xmath33 can decay both into leptons and anti - leptons , i.e.  lepton number is violated in these decays . in conjunction with @xmath16 violating sphaleron transitions this leads to the required non - conservation of baryon number . further , violation of @xmath4 and @xmath1 comes about since the yukawa couplings @xmath28 are , in general , complex , thereby making possible the generation of a non - vanishing baryon asymmetry in these decays .",
    "a further complication is that the heavy neutrinos also mediate lepton number violating scattering processes which can erase any lepton asymmetry @xcite .",
    "however , the interaction rates for these processes are suppressed by the large mass of the heavy neutrinos if the temperature @xmath12 is smaller than their mass .",
    "hence , the lepton asymmetries produced in decays of the heavier neutrinos @xmath34 will be erased by lepton number violating scatterings mediated by the lightest of the heavy neutrinos , @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , in the simplest case of hierarchical heavy neutrino masses , @xmath36 , only decays of @xmath35 can potentially explain the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "the required deviation from thermal equilibrium is provided by the expansion of the universe . when the universe has cooled down to a temperature of order the heavy neutrino mass @xmath37 , the equilibrium number density becomes exponentially suppressed .",
    "if the neutrinos are sufficiently weakly coupled they are not able to follow the rapid change of the equilibrium particle distribution once the temperature falls below their mass .",
    "hence , the deviation from thermal equilibrium consists in a too large number density of heavy neutrinos compared to the equilibrium density @xcite .",
    "technically this requires the total decay width of @xmath35 to be smaller than the expansion rate , the hubble parameter @xmath38 , at the time of decay , i.e.when @xmath39 .",
    "this is the case if the _ effective neutrino mass _ , defined as @xmath40 is smaller than the _ equilibrium neutrino mass _ @xmath41 where we have used @xmath42  gev and @xmath43 as effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the plasma .",
    "the effective neutrino mass @xmath44 is a measure of the strength of the coupling of @xmath35 to the thermal bath .    in order to see whether this mechanism of leptogenesis @xcite can indeed explain the observed baryon asymmetry a careful numerical study is needed .",
    "as we shall see , successful leptogenesis is possible for @xmath45 as well as @xmath46 .",
    "a quantitative description of this non - equilibrium process is obtained by means of kinetic equations .",
    "the evolution of particle number densities in the early universe is influenced not only by interactions but also by the expansion of the universe .",
    "it is convenient to scale out the expansion by considering the particle number @xmath47 in some comoving volume element instead of the number density @xmath48 . for definiteness",
    ", we choose the comoving volume @xmath49 which contains one photon at a time @xmath50 before the onset of leptogenesis , @xmath51 the final baryon asymmetry is expressed in terms of the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath18 , to be compared with the observed value @xmath52 ( cf .",
    "( [ etabcmb ] ) ) .",
    "this is related to the @xmath10 asymmetry in a comoving volume element by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the dilution factor due to the production of photons from the onset of leptogenesis until recombination , assuming the standard isentropic expansion of the universe .",
    "further , it is convenient to replace time @xmath55 by @xmath56 , where @xmath37 is the mass of the decaying neutrino .",
    "this is possible , since in a radiation dominated universe both variables are related by the expansion rate of the universe , the hubble parameter @xmath38 , @xmath57    in the simplest case of a hierarchical mass spectrum of right - handed neutrinos , @xmath58 , a numerical description of leptogenesis is provided by a set of two coupled differential equations @xcite , @xmath59   { dn_{b - l}\\over dz } & = & -\\varepsilon_1\\,d\\,\\left(n_{n_1}-n_{n_1}^{\\rm eq}\\right )                          -w\\,n_{b - l }                          \\label{b2}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the terms on the right - hand side describe the effects of particle interactions .",
    "there are four classes of processes which contribute : decays , inverse decays , @xmath60 scatterings and @xmath61 processes mediated by heavy neutrinos .",
    "the term @xmath62 accounts for decays and inverse decays , while the scattering term @xmath63 represents the @xmath60 scatterings .",
    "decays also yield the source term for the generation of the @xmath10 asymmetry , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) , while all other processes contribute to the total washout term @xmath64 which competes with the decay source term .",
    "note that , in thermal equilibrium , @xmath65 , no @xmath10 asymmetry can be generated , illustrating the need for a deviation from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the amount of @xmath10 asymmetry being produced by the source term is controlled by the @xmath1 asymmetry @xmath66 in the decay of @xmath35 .    in order to understand the dependence of the solutions on the neutrino parameters , it is crucial to note that the interactions terms @xmath62 and @xmath63 as well as the contribution from @xmath35 exchange to @xmath64 are all proportional to the effective neutrino mass , @xmath67 whereas the strength of the remaining contribution to the washout term , @xmath68 , is determined by @xmath69 , the sum over the light neutrino masses squared , @xmath70    if one assumes a vanishing initial @xmath10 asymmetry before the onset of leptogenesis , i.e.  at @xmath71 , the solution for @xmath72 has the simple form @xmath73 where we have introduced the _ efficiency factor _",

    "a measurement of the neutrino mass scale above the leptogenesis bound would require significant modifications of the minimal leptogenesis scenario that we described .",
    "the possibilities include quasi - degenerate heavy neutrinos @xcite , non - thermal leptogenesis scenarios @xcite or a non - minimal seesaw mechanism as in theories with higgs triplets @xcite .",
    "the upper bound on the neutrino masses ( [ mbound ] ) arises when the information on @xmath182 from neutrino mixing experiments is employed .",
    "the value of @xmath182 sets the scale for the transition from a hierarchical , with @xmath197 , to a quasi - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum with @xmath198 . the joint action of the @xmath1 asymmetry suppression for @xmath199 and @xmath200 ( cf .",
    "( [ beta ] ) ) , together with the washout from the @xmath68 term , place a limit to the level of degeneracy of the light neutrino masses and , using the measured value of the atmospheric neutrino mass scale , an upper bound on the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "we now want to study how this upper bound gets relaxed if the experimental measurement of the atmospheric neutrino mass scale is ignored .",
    "since the maximal asymmetry is obtained for hierarchical neutrinos , i.e. @xmath201 , we have to use the simple bound ( [ e1maxm1 ] ) .",
    "this also implies that the upper bound on the absolute neutrino mass scale will coincide with an upper bound on the atmospheric neutrino mass scale itself , since @xmath202 .",
    "the maximal baryon asymmetry is then approximately given by @xmath203 using eq .",
    "( [ kfzb ] ) it is easy to see that the maximum of the asymmetry is realized for @xmath204 and is then given by @xmath205    in the case of zero initial @xmath35 abundance the maximum is obtained for @xmath206 , where @xmath207 and @xmath208 , implying @xmath209 note that the peak lies in the strong washout regime where results do not depend on the initial conditions .    for @xmath210 , eq .",
    "( [ peakm3 ] ) is in good agreement with the numerical results of ref",

    "if we do not make use of the experimental information on @xmath182 and just require that the peak asymmetry is larger than the observed value given by eq .",
    "( [ etabcmb ] ) , then we obtain the upper bound @xmath211 together with eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) this implies the lower bound for heavy neutrinos masses , @xmath212 this exercise shows that without the experimental knowledge of @xmath182 the bound on light neutrino masses would have been much looser .",
    "however , it also demonstrates , even more remarkably , that the neutrino oscillation data , together with the laboratory bounds on light neutrino masses , represents a highly non trivial test of thermal leptogenesis .    as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the leptogenesis bound of 0.1  ev appears to have a theoretical uncertainty of about 0.03  ev . for comparison ,",
    "ten years ago it was believed , based on the same equations , that majorana masses @xmath213  kev and @xmath214  tev were compatible with thermal leptogenesis @xcite . during the past years theory and experiment contributed about equally , on a logarithmic scale , to the progress .",
    "on the theoretical side the better understanding of the boltzmann equations was important whereas the measurement of the atmospheric neutrino mass scale was the crucial experimental ingredient .",
    "actually , the successful matching of thermal leptogenesis predictions with experimental data is even more intriguing . from eq .",
    "( [ etabmax ] ) we can derive an upper bound on @xmath99 by using the strong washout behaviour @xmath215 ( cf .",

    "furthermore , the favoured strong washout regime implies @xmath222 .",
    "hence , leptogenesis favours for the atmospheric mass scale the range @xmath223 , in remarkable agreement with experimental data . thanks to this ` conspiracy ' the seesaw mechanism , for the same values of the involved parameters",
    ", explains equally well both the neutrino masses and the observed baryon asymmetry , with a remarkable independence on the assumptions about the inflationary stage or , more generally , the cosmological stages that precede leptogenesis .",
    "this conspiracy would become even more impressive if the lightest neutrino mass should turn out to be larger than @xmath104 .",
    "this would imply , in a completely model independent way , @xmath224 , with thermal leptogenesis in the strong washout regime .",
    "together with the upper bound @xmath225 , this selects the optimal _ leptogenesis window _ @xmath226 for the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "leptogenesis is closely related to other processes involving neutrinos and charged leptons .",
    "the upper bound on the light neutrino masses and the lower bound on the heavy neutrino masses have already been discussed in the previous section .",
    "very interesting are also the connection with neutrino mixing and with lepton flavour changing processes in supersymmetric theories . during the past years",
