    "in the standard theory of an accretion disk around a black hole it is assumed that there is no coupling between the disk and the central black hole @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of a magnetic field , a magnetic coupling between the disk and the black hole could exist and play an important role in the balance and transportation of energy and angular momentum ( zeldovich and schwartzman , quoted in thorne 1974 ; thorne , price , and macdonald 1986 ; blandford 1998 , 1999 ; van putten 1999 ; gruzinov 1999 ; li 2000c ; li and paczyski 2000 ; brown et al 2000 ) .",
    "though this issue was commented by zeldovich and schwartzman more than twenty years ago and by many other people afterwards , a detailed and quantitative calculation has not appeared until @xcite . in the absence of the magnetic coupling ,",
    "the energy source for the radiation of the disk is the gravitational energy of the disk ( i.e. , the gravitational binding energy between the disk and the black hole ) .",
    "but , if the magnetic coupling exists and the black hole is rotating , the rotational energy of the black hole provides an additional energy source for the radiation of the disk . with the magnetic coupling ,",
    "the black hole exerts a torque on the disk , which transfers energy and angular momentum between the black hole and the disk .",
    "if the black hole rotates faster than the disk , energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and transfered to the disk .",
    "the energy deposited into the disk is eventually radiated away by the disk , which will increase the efficiency of the disk and make the disk brighter than usual .",
    "if the black hole rotates slower than the disk , energy and angular momentum are transfered from the disk to the black hole , which will lower the efficiency of the disk and make the disk dimmer than usual .",
    "therefore , the magnetic coupling between the black hole and the disk has important effects on the radiation properties of the disk . in this paper",
    "we investigate these effects in detail .    to be specific , we consider a model that a thin keplerian disk rotates around a kerr black hole in the equatorial plane , and a magnetic field connects the black hole to the disk @xcite .",
    "this model is a variant of the standard blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite . in the standard blandford - znajek mechanism , the magnetic field threading the black hole",
    "is assumed to close on a load which could be very far from the black hole . due to the large scale involved and the fact that the physics in the load region is ill understood , in some sense",
    "the blandford - znajek model is not well defined and thus the involved physics is extremely complicated . since the load is far from the black hole , the magnetic field suffers from the screw instability @xcite . due to the lack of knowledge of the physics in the load region , we do not have a good model for the load .",
    "the way people usually adopt is to assume the load is a resistor whose resistance is roughly equal to the resistance of the black hole @xcite . since the load is so far from the black hole that the load can not be casually connected to the black hole , it is hard to understand how the load can conspire with the black hole to have equal resistances and satisfy the impedance matching condition @xcite .    compared with the standard blandford - znajek mechanism , the model we consider here is simpler and relatively well defined . in our model ,",
    "the magnetic field lines threading the black hole close on the disk rather than a remote load .",
    "the disk is much better understood than the remote load though the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) of the disk is still very complicated @xcite . in most cases",
    "the disk can be treated as fully ionized and thus its resistance is negligible compared with the resistance of the black hole which is several hundred ohms . in other words , it is a good approximation to assume that the disk is perfectly conducting and the magnetic field lines are frozen in the disk .",
    "certainly mhd instabilities have important effects on the dynamics of the disk and the magnetic field  in fact people believe that the mhd instabilities play an important role in transporting angular momentum within the disk @xcite , but here we choose to ignore this topic since the problem of mhd instabilities is so complicated that a detailed discussion will be beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "we assume that the disk is thin and keplerian , lies in the equatorial plane of the black hole with the inner boundary being at the marginally stable orbit @xcite .",
    "this requires that , the magnetic field is so weak that its influence on the dynamics of the particles in the disk is negligible .",
    "but , the role played a weak magnetic field in the balance and transportation of energy and angular momentum may be important .",
    "( in section [ sec5 ] we will justify the approximation of a weak magnetic field in detail . ) with this `` weak magnetic field approximation '' , the particles in the disk move around the central black hole on circular orbits with a superposition of a small radial inflow motion .",
    "if the inflow time - scale is much longer than the dynamical ( rotational ) time - scale of the disk , the disk and the magnetic field can be in a quasi - steady state even though the magnetic field slowly moves toward the central black hole along with the accretion . by `` quasi - steady state '' we mean that any macroscopic quantity at a given radius in the disk slowly changes with time : the integrated change within one rotational period of the disk is much smaller than the quantity itself . with the assumption that the disk is thin and keplerian , and the magnetic field and the disk are in a quasi - steady state",
    ", we will solve the conservation equations of energy and angular momentum , and calculate the radiation flux of the disk , the internal viscous torque of the disk , and compare the results with those predicted by the standard theory of an accretion disk .",
    "recently , several people have considered the magnetic coupling between the disk and the material in the transition region between the disk and the black hole horizon , and have argued that such a coupling produces a torque at the inner boundary of the disk @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our model is distinctly different from theirs : ( 1 ) in our model , the magnetic field connects the disk to the black hole , thus the torque on the disk is produced by the black hole ; in their model , the magnetic field connects the disk to the material in the transition region , thus the torque on the disk is produced by the material in the transition region .",
    "( 2 ) in our model , the magnetic field lines are assumed to connect the disk surfaces to the black hole horizon at intermediate latitudes ; while in their model , the magnetic field is in the plane of the disk within the inner edge of the disk thus magnetic reconnection can easily take place @xcite . (",
    "3 ) in our model , the magnetic field can touch the disk over a range of radii ; while in their model , the magnetic field is attached to the disk only at the inner boundary of the disk @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) in our model , we will show that the torque produced by the black hole propagates outward only and thus the torque at the inner boundary of the disk is zero ; in their model , the torque is non - zero at the inner boundary of the disk and extends into the transition region @xcite .",
    "( 5 ) in our model , energy and angular momentum can be extracted from the black hole even in the case with no accretion ; in their model , in order to extract energy and angular momentum from the black hole accretion must exist so that negative energy and angular momentum are carried into the black hole horizon by the accretion material @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we discuss the transfer of energy and angular momentum between the black hole and the disk arising from the magnetic coupling between them . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we solve the conservation equations of energy and angular momentum for a quasi - steady and thin keplerian accretion disk torqued by a black hole and calculate the radiation flux , the internal viscous torque , and the total power of the disk . in section [ sec3a ]",
    "we argue that , with magnetic coupling to a rapidly rotating black hole , a disk can radiate without accretion .",
    "such a non - accretion disk is purely powered by the rotational energy of the black hole and has an infinite efficiency . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we study a specific example : the magnetic field lines touch the disk at a circle of a constant radius , and look for the consequences of the magnetic coupling .",
    "we show that , the radial profile of the radiation flux produced by the magnetic coupling is very different from that produced by accretion . in section [ sec5 ]",
    ", we justify the assumptions made in the paper , and discuss the limitations of our model which include the ignorance of the instabilities of the disk and the magnetic field and the ignorance of the radiation captured by the black hole and the radiation returning to the disk . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we draw our conclusions .    throughout the paper we use the geometric units @xmath0 and",
    "the boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in the presence of a magnetic field a black hole behaves like a conductor with a surface resistivity @xmath2 ohms @xcite .",
    "so , when a black hole rotates in an external magnetic field , an electromotive force ( emf ) is induced on its horizon @xcite . as @xcite were first to note ,",
    "the voltage drop along the magnetic field lines induced by the black hole rotation is huge enough to give rise a cascade production of electron - positron pairs , thereby producing a highly conducting electron - positron pair plasma ( magnetosphere or corona ) around the black hole and the disk .",
    "assume the magnetic field lines threading the black hole go through the magnetosphere and close on the disk which rotates around the black hole .",
    "since the plasma disk is a good conductor , the rotation of the disk induces an emf on the disk @xcite .",
    "the black hole and the disk form a closed electric circuit , an electric current flows along the magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere and close itself in the disk and the black hole .",
    "suppose the disk and the black hole rotates in the same direction , then the black hole s emf , @xmath3 , and the disk s emf , @xmath4 , have opposite signs .",
    "the direction of the electric current , and in turn the direction of the transfer of energy and angular momentum , is determined by the sign of @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 , the black hole s emf dominates the disk s emf , so the black hole `` charges '' the disk : energy and angular momentum are transfered from the black hole to the disk .",
    "if @xmath7 , the disk s emf dominates the black hole s emf , so the disk `` charges '' the black hole , energy and angular momentum are transfered from the disk to the black hole . if @xmath8 , the black hole s emf balances the disk s emf , then no energy and angular momentum are transfered between the black hole and the disk @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the electromagnetic power and torque on the disk , using the standard electromagnetism . for the specific case that the magnetic field lines touch the disk at a single radius ,",
    "the calculations are carried out by @xcite . in this case , the sign of @xmath5 ( and thus the direction of the transfer of energy and angular momentum ) is determined by the sign of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the angular velocity of the black hole which is constant over the black hole horizon , @xmath11 is the angular velocity of the disk at the radius where the magnetic field touches the disk . if @xmath12 , i.e. if the black hole rotates faster than the disk , energy and angular momentum are transfered from the black hole to the disk .",
    "if @xmath13 , i.e. if the black hole rotates slower than the disk , energy and angular momentum are transfered from the disk to the black hole . if @xmath14 , there is no transfer of energy and angular momentum between the black hole and the disk . for fixed values of the magnetic flux , the mass and the angular momentum of the black hole , and the resistance of the black hole , the power peaks at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic field is distributed over a differentially rotating disk , the formulae given in @xcite for the emf of the disk , the power , and the torque on the disk should be replaced with integrations over the radius of the disk .",
    "assume the magnetic field is stationary and axisymmetric , and touches the disk at radii ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , then , the total emf induced on the disk is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnetic flux through a surface whose boundary is a circle with a constant @xmath20 in the disk . in such a case , an infinite number of adjacent infinitesimal poloidal electric current loops flow between the black hole and the disk along the magnetic field lines connecting them .",
    "each infinitesimal current loop produces an infinitesimal power and an infinitesimal torque on the disk , whose summation gives the the total power and the total torque on the disk .",
    "thus , assuming the disk is perfectly conducting , the total power produced by the black hole on the disk is @xmath21 where we have treated the black hole s resistance @xmath22 as a function of the disk s radius , which is defined by a map from the black hole horizon to the disk surface given by the magnetic field lines .",
    "similarly , the total torque produced by the black hole on the disk is @xmath23 from equation ( [ pow2 ] ) and equation ( [ toq2 ] ) we have @xmath24 , or @xmath25 which follows from the assumption that the disk is perfectly conducting so the magnetic field is frozen in the disk .    for a kerr black hole of mass @xmath26 and angular momentum @xmath27 , we have @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the radius of the outer horizon of the black hole , @xmath30 is the polar angle coordinate on the horizon .",
    "then , @xmath31 can be calculated through @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a map between the @xmath30 coordinate on the horizon and the @xmath20 coordinate on the disk , which is induced by the magnetic field lines connecting the disk to the horizon . since @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", we have @xmath36 .",
    "of particular interest is the case of an accretion disk in a steady state , which is simple enough for solving the equations of energy conservation and angular momentum conservation and has been well studied when the magnetic coupling between the black hole and disk does not exist @xcite . in a steady state ,",
    "the material of the disk advected with accretion toward smaller radii is balanced by the material advected from larger radii . any macroscopic ( statistically averaged ) quantity of the disk remains ( approximately ) unchanged for a long period of time during accretion ( say , over a time interval @xmath37 rotation periods of the disk ) .",
    "when there is a magnetic field connecting the black hole to the disk , the disk and the magnetic field can not be in an exactly steady state unless there is no accretion at all . when there is accretion , the magnetic field frozen in the disk slowly moves toward the central black hole as accretion goes on , which raises the question how long a configuration of magnetic connection can be maintained . due to the complex topologies of the magnetic field ,",
    "the magnetic field advected with accretion toward smaller radii , which connects the black hole to the disk , does not have to be balanced by the magnetic field advected from larger radii which also connects the black hole to the disk .",
    "however , if the radial velocity of particles in the disk is much smaller than their rotational velocity , the inflow time - scale is much larger than the dynamical time - scale .",
    "then , it is reasonable to assume that within one rotation period , the global configuration of the magnetic field is almost unchanged , and the overall change in a macroscopic quantity at a given radius in the disk is much smaller than the quantity itself .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , we say that the disk and the magnetic field are in a quasi - steady state . in a quasi - steady state ,",
    "a macroscopic quantity at a given radius may change significantly over a long period of time and the magnetic connection between the black hole and the disk may disappear at last , but they are approximately unchanged within one rotation period of the disk . in this section",
    "we solve the equations for energy conservation and angular momentum conservation for such a quasi - steady state disk magnetically coupled to a black hole .    for a steady , axisymmetric , and thin keplerian disk around a kerr black hole",
    ", the general relativistic equations of energy conservation and angular momentum conservation have been investigated in detail by @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "assume the magnetic field is weak so that its influence on the dynamics of disk particles is negligible , then a thin keplerian disk is a good approximation we will justify the weak magnetic field approximation and the importance of a weak magnetic field in the balance and transportation of energy and angular momentum in detail . ] .",
    "with the magnetic coupling between the black hole and the disk being taken into account , for a quasi - steady state the conservation of angular momentum is described by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the accretion rate of mass ( measured by an observer at infinity ; we use the convention @xmath40 for accretion ) , @xmath41 is the specific angular momentum of a particle in the disk , @xmath42 is the internal viscous torque of the disk , @xmath43 is the energy flux radiated away from the surface of the disk ( measured by an observer co - rotating with the disk ) , and @xmath44 is the flux of angular momentum transfered from the black hole to the disk by the magnetic field .",
    "the conservation of energy is described by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the specific energy of a particle in the disk . when @xmath47 , i.e. , there is no magnetic coupling , equation ( [ con_ang ] ) and equation ( [ con_ener ] ) return to the equations derived by @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "@xmath52 is constant throughout the disk ( the conservation of mass ) .",

    "the `` no - torque inner boundary condition '' is an excellent approximation @xcite .",
    "though recently this boundary condition has been challenged when there is a magnetic connection between the disk and the material in the transition region @xcite , in this paper we do not consider such a magnetic connection thus we adopt the `` no - torque inner boundary condition '' .",

    "@xmath87 represents the rate of energy transfered from the black hole to the disk , which is absent in the standard theory of an accretion disk .    from equation ( [ bal ] ) , the total efficiency of the disk is @xmath88 if @xmath89 , i.e. there is no energy transfer between the black hole and the disk by the magnetic coupling  as the case in the standard theory of an accretion disk , @xmath90 and the power of the disk purely comes from the gravitational energy of the disk . if @xmath91 , which is the case when the black hole rotates faster than the disk , energy is transfered from the black hole to the disk .",
    "then there are two sources for the power of the disk : one is the gravitational energy of the disk ( represented by @xmath86 ) , the other is the rotational energy of the black hole ( represented by @xmath87 ) .",
    "the efficiency of the disk is increased by the magnetic coupling : @xmath92 .",
    "for very small @xmath52 , an efficiency @xmath93 can be achieved .",
    "if there is no accretion at all , the total efficiency of the disk is infinite . if @xmath94 , which is the case when the black hole rotates slower than the disk , energy is transfered from the disk to the black hole .",
    "then , the efficiency of the disk is decreased by the magnetic coupling : @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath85 can not be negative , we must have @xmath96",
    "for a disk magnetically coupled to a rapidly rotating black hole , an extremely interesting feature is that the disk can radiate without accretion .",
    "this can be seen directly from equation ( [ flux1 ] ) and equation ( [ int_p ] ) : when @xmath97 , @xmath43 is non - negative over the disk and @xmath85 is positive if @xmath98 for any @xmath99 , and @xmath100 from equation ( [ toqh ] ) , the sign of @xmath44 is determined by the sign of @xmath101 since @xmath102 .",
    "since @xmath10 is constant over the horizon of the black hole and @xmath103 for @xmath99 over the disk , conditions ( [ cond_x ] ) and ( [ cond_y ] ) are equivalent to the requirement that @xmath104 over the disk and @xmath105 at least over an interval of @xmath99 .",

    "a standard accretion disk radiates only if the accretion rate is non - zero , and the efficiency of a standard accretion disk is always smaller than @xmath109 .",
    "( the maximum efficiency @xmath109 can be reached only for a disk around an extreme kerr black hole with @xmath110 . ) for the model of a disk magnetically coupled to the material in the transition region , though it has been demonstrated that the efficiency of the disk is unbounded from above if the black hole rotates faster than the disk @xcite , a state with a zero accretion rate and a finite power can never be realized since in that model in order to extract energy from the black hole material with negative energy must fall into the black hole thus accretion must exist @xcite .",

    "there are two torques acting on the disk : one is the external torque produced by the magnetic coupling to the black hole , the other is the internal torque which conveys angular momentum within the disk and dissipates energy .",
    "we do not discuss the origin of the internal torque , we only assume the internal torque exists and the disk automatically adjusts its internal torque so that quasi - steady state solutions exist . if the internal torque balances the external torque exactly  as assumed in section [ sec4.1 ] , which can be true only if the black hole rotates faster than the disk , then a steady state with no accretion is built . in such a case ,",
    "all the power of the disk comes from the rotational energy of the black hole , the disk has an infinite efficiency .",

    "the radiation flux is plotted in fig .",

    "[ fig8 ] , respectively for the case that the black hole rotates faster than the disk ( @xmath227 ) and for the case that the black hole rotates slower than the disk ( @xmath228 ) . in both cases , for @xmath187 the solutions are the same as those predicted by the standard theory of a thin keplerian disk @xcite , in particular @xmath43 and @xmath42 are zero at @xmath67 .",
    "the extensions of the standard solutions to @xmath189 are shown with dashed curves , the positions of @xmath226 are shown with vertical dotted lines . due to the magnetic coupling to the black hole , @xmath43 and @xmath42 are modified for @xmath189 by superposing the contribution of the magnetic coupling to the standard solutions . for @xmath190 , the radiation flux given by the standard theory decreases as @xmath229 , while the radiation flux contributed by the magnetic coupling decreases as @xmath230 .",
    "thus , at large radii the radiation flux @xmath43 is dominated by the contribution of accretion .",
    "this is also true for the viscous torque in the disk , i.e. , at large radii the torque in the disk is dominated by the contribution of accretion . when the black hole rotates faster than the disk  as the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the black hole pumps energy and angular momentum into the disk , the energy is locally dissipated in the disk and eventually radiated away , a bright annular `` bump '' is produced at @xmath177 . when the black hole rotates slower than the disk  as the case shown in fig .",

    "when the black hole rotates slower than the disk ( i.e. , @xmath228 ) , @xmath113 is negative thus energy and angular momentum are transfered from the disk to the black hole . from equation ( [ fdel ] ) , the minimum radiation flux at @xmath177 is @xmath231\\ , ,      \\label{flux0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which ( and the minimum @xmath42 at @xmath177 ) is non - negative if and only if @xmath232 where we have used the fact that @xmath233 in the disk",
    ". therefore , when the black hole rotates slower than the disk , quasi - steady solutions exist only if the condition in equation ( [ positive ] ) is satisfied .",
    "in particular , since @xmath234 , no quasi - steady solutions exist if the magnetic field touches the disk at the inner boundary and the black hole rotates slower than the disk ( i.e. @xmath235 ) .",
    "for a non - accretion disk magnetically coupled to a black hole , a steady state can be established if the magnetic field is frozen in the disk and the angular momentum transfered from the black hole to the disk is steadily conveyed outward by an internal viscous torque .",
    "when there is accretion , an exactly steady state can not exist since the magnetic field frozen in the disk slowly moves toward the central black hole with the accretion flow .",
    "however , if the inflow velocity of the disk is much smaller than the rotational velocity , we can expect the disk and the magnetic field to be in a quasi - steady state , which means that any macroscopic quantity at a given radius in the disk slowly changes with time : the overall change within one rotation period is negligible compared with the quantity itself . for example , the magnetic flux within a given radius is @xmath236 , the change of the magnetic flux within one rotation period is @xmath237 , where @xmath238 is the rotation period , @xmath239 is the rotational velocity of the disk , @xmath240 is the radial velocity of the particles in the disk ( we adopt the convention that @xmath241 for accretion ) .",
    "obviously , we have @xmath242 for a disk with @xmath243 .",
    "the assumption of a quasi - steady state is more or less similar to the assumption of `` adiabatic invariance '' usually discussed in galactic dynamics and quantum mechanics where it is assumed that a potential changes very slowly with time so that within one rotation / oscillation period the potential can be treated as unchanged . for a quasi - steady state",
    ", the magnetic connection between the black hole and the disk may evolve with time from the view of a long time interval , but within one rotation period the magnetic connection is approximately unchanged .    in searching for quasi - steady state solutions we have assumed that the magnetic field is weak so that its influence on the dynamics of particles in the disk is negligible , and thus a thin keplerian disk is a good approximation .",
    "this `` weak magnetic field assumption '' requires that @xmath244 in the disk , where @xmath245 is the mass density of the disk , @xmath246 is the gravitational acceleration produced by the black hole . since @xmath247 , @xmath248 , equation ( [ weak1 ] )",

    "there is a large room for @xmath266 to satisfy both equation ( [ weak ] ) and equation ( [ bal2 ] ) if @xmath267 equation ( [ room ] ) is always satisfied by a thin and quasi - steady disk .    in all our analyses",
    "the instabilities of the magnetic field and the disk are ignored , but in practice they may be important . because of the outwardly decreasing differential rotation , a plasma disk threaded by a weak magnetic field is subject to the balbus - hawley instability @xcite . within a few rotational periods the magnetic field lines in the disk become chaotic and tangled , the disk becomes turbulent .",
    "this magneto - rotational instability is assumed to play an important role in transporting angular momentum within the disk , which is important for producing accretion @xcite . for a thin disk ,",
    "the effect of magnetic reconnection becomes important if the poloidal magnetic field lines threading the disk are twisted too much by the rotation of the disk and the central object .",
    "this may put a restriction on the amplitude of the toroidal magnetic field near the plane of the disk , which in turn restricts the power of the energy and the angular momentum transfered between the central object and the disk @xcite .",
    "but due to the fact that a black hole has a large resistance , the situation here may not be so serious as in the case when the central object is a star .",
    "the screw instability of the magnetic field plays a similar role in limiting the amplitude of the toroidal magnetic field and in turn the power and torque of the central black hole @xcite .",
    "thus , considering the effect of magnetic reconnection or the screw instability , the actual power and the torque of the black hole may be somewhat smaller than those given by equation ( [ pow2 ] ) and equation ( [ toq2 ] ) .",
    "if the instabilities are strong enough , the situation may change so dramatically that quasi - steady state solutions do not exist .",
    "all these effects of instabilities will be addressed in detail in future .",
    "not all photons emitted by the disk escape to infinity .",
    "some return to the disk , some are captured by the black hole , due to the gravity of the black hole and the shape of the disk @xcite .",
    "these effects are especially important in the inner disk region when @xmath268 is close to @xmath269 .",
    "the radiation returning to the disk is dissipated and re - radiated , and eventually reaches infinity or falls into the black hole .",
    "the radiation flux and the overall power of the disk are affected by the photons captured by the black hole and the photons returning to the disk .",
    "the black hole s capture cross - section is greater for photons of negative angular momentum ( angular momentum opposite to the spin of the black hole ) than for photons of positive angular momentum @xcite .",
    "thus , photon capture tends to spin down the black hole . considering the effect of photon capture",
    ", @xcite has shown that a black hole will be prevented from spinning up beyond a limiting state with @xmath270 through accretion from a thin keplerian disk may be exceeded if a black hole is spun - up by an external torque , such as in black hole mergers @xcite , or through accretion from a thick disk @xcite . ] . for a standard accretion disk without a magnetic coupling , depending on the spin of the black hole , among the energy radiated by the disk up to @xmath271",
    "is captured by the black hole , up to @xmath272 returns to the disk .",
    "for a disk with a magnetic coupling , more energy is captured by the black hole or returns to the disk . in an extreme case when the magnetic field lines touch the disk at the inner boundary and",
    "there is no accretion , depending on the spin of the black hole , among the energy radiated by the disk up to @xmath273 is captured by the black hole , up to @xmath274 returns to the disk , as in the `` infinite efficiency limit '' case of a disk magnetically coupled to the material in the transition region @xcite . considering the effect of radiation capture , the radiation flux at the inner part of the disk is moderately modified . however , in the case of a non - accretion disk magnetically coupled to a kerr black hole , the returning radiation dominates at large radii since the radiation due to the magnetic coupling scales as @xmath230 while the returning radiation scales as @xmath229 @xcite . in our calculations the effects of photon capture ( either captured by the black hole or returning to the disk ) are ignored , we hope to consider them in future .",
    "for an accretion disk magnetically coupled to a kerr black hole , quasi - steady state solutions are obtained by assuming the inflow time - scale of particles in the disk is much longer than the rotational time - scale  as adopted in the standard theory of an accretion disk .",
    "though the magnetic field frozen in the disk slowly moves toward the central black hole as accretion goes on , the inflow velocity of the magnetic field and the particles is much smaller than the rotation velocity of the disk .",
    "thus , within one rotation period the magnetic field configuration can approximately be regarded as unchanged , and the assumption of a quasi - steady state can be applied . for a general distribution of the magnetic field connecting the disk to the black hole ,",
    "the solutions for the radiation flux and the internal viscous torque are given by equation ( [ flux1 ] ) and equation ( [ torque1 ] ) , which are superpositions of the the contribution from accretion and the contribution from magnetic coupling . from the view of a long period of time ( e.g. with many rotation periods ) , the radiation flux and",
    "the internal torque of the disk varies with time ( the magnetic connection may even disappear finally ) , but equation ( [ flux1 ] ) and equation ( [ torque1 ] ) give the instant values of the radiation flux and the internal torque of the disk .",
    "these general solutions clearly show that for any distribution of a magnetic field on the disk , the torque produced by the magnetic coupling propagates outward only , thus the internal torque and the radiation flux are always zero at the inner boundary of the disk . even for the extreme case that the magnetic field touches the disk at the inner boundary ,",
    "the internal torque @xmath42 and the radiation flux @xmath43 of the disk are also zero at the inner boundary : beyond the marginally stable orbit , as @xmath20 decreases , @xmath42 and @xmath43 increase but suddenly drops to zero at @xmath67 .",
    "we emphasize that this feature differs from the case of a disk magnetically connected to the material in the transition region , where the magnetic stress is demonstrated to be non - zero at the inner boundary and extends into the transition region @xcite .    if the black hole rotates faster than the disk , the black hole pumps energy and angular momentum into the disk through magnetic coupling , which increases the efficiency of the disk .",
    "most interestingly , with the existence of the magnetic coupling , a disk can radiate without accretion : all the power of the the disk comes from the rotational energy of the black hole , such a non - accretion disk has an infinite efficiency .",
    "we have discussed in detail a simple but important case : the magnetic field touches the non - accretion disk at a single radius @xmath226  or equivalently , the magnetic field is distributed on the disk within a narrow region around @xmath226 .",
    "for this simple case , the radiation flux has a sharp peak at @xmath226 : it is zero for @xmath187 and decreases quickly for @xmath189 . at large radii ,",
    "the radiation flux approaches @xmath191 .",
    "this behavior of the radiation flux is very different from that of a standard accretion disk , where the radiation flux spreads widely over radii and approaches @xmath193 at large radii .",
    "we have compared the radiation flux of a non - accretion disk with the magnetic field touching the disk at the inner boundary ( i.e. the marginally stable orbit ) , with the radiation flux of a standard accretion disk in detail .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . clearly ,",
    "the radiation profile of the non - accretion disk is very different from that of the standard accretion disk : the non - accretion disk magnetically coupled to a rapidly rotating black hole has a bigger emissivity index throughout the disk and a radiation region closer to the center of the disk .",
    "we have also shown that the magnetic field lines touching the disk at the inner boundary is most efficient in extracting energy from the black hole , though the power of the black hole peaks at @xmath275 .",
    "a non - accretion state can exist only if the internal torque of the disk exactly balances the external torque on the disk produced by the magnetic coupling .",
    "if the disk has so much internal torque that can not be balanced by the external torque , the excess internal torque will produce accretion .",
    "for an accretion disk with the magnetic field touching the disk at a single radius , a specific feature is that the radiation flux of the disk may have two maxima ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "when the black hole rotates faster than the disk , the black hole pumps energy to the disk and the second maximum in the radiation flux is produced by adding a bright `` bump '' to the standard radiation flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "when the black hole rotates slower than the disk , the black hole extracts energy from the disk  in such a case the efficiency of the disk is decreased by the magnetic coupling  and the second maximum in the radiation flux is produced by digging a dark `` valley '' in the standard radiation flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the position of the second maximum is determined by the position where the magnetic field touches the disk . if the magnetic field is smoothly distributed over the disk instead of touching the disk at a single radius or distributed on the disk within a narrow interval of radii , one of the two maxima in the radiation flux may be smeared out .    for a black hole with @xmath252 ,",
    "the power of the black hole is approximately @xmath276 if the magnetic field lines touch the disk close to the inner boundary ( @xmath277 ) .",
    "if the energy deposited into the disk by the black hole is radiated away locally  either thermally or non - thermally , we can define an effective radiation temperature through @xmath278 where @xmath279 is the stephan - boltzmann constant .",
    "interestingly , this temperature depends only on the strength of the magnetic field on the disk . if the energy is radiated thermally , the radiation is in the uv to soft x - ray domain for @xmath280 gauss .",
    "the recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of soft x - ray emission lines from two narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies mcg 6 - 30 - 15 and mrk 766 shows an extreme big emissivity index ( @xmath281 ) , which has been suggested to indicate that most of the line emission originates from the inner part of a relativistic accretion disk @xcite . from the calculations in section [ sec4.1 ] , we have seen that for a non - accretion disk magnetically coupled to a rapidly rotating black hole with the magnetic field touching the disk at the inner boundary , most radiation comes from a region more concentrated toward the center of the disk and a big emissivity index can be easily realized at any radius , compared to the case for a standard accretion disk .",
    "thus , probably the observational results of _ xmm - newton _ can be more easily explained with the model presented in this paper .",
    "another observation which may be relevant to our model is the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in x - ray binaries , which has been suggested to originate from the inner edge of a relativistic accretion disk ( van der klis 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the magnetic field connecting the black hole to the disk does not have to be axisymmetric .",
    "if a bunch of magnetic field lines connect the black hole to the disk and the feet of the magnetic field lines are concentrated in a small region in the disk , a hot spot will be produced on the disk surface if the black hole rotates faster than the disk .",
    "if @xmath252 , the temperature of the hot spot is approximately given by equation ( [ tem ] ) .    in our analyses the magnetic field has been assumed to be weak and the effect of instabilities of the disk plasma and the magnetic field has been ignored .",
    "the situation with a strong magnetic field may be significantly different from that has been discussed in this paper , at least the inner part of the disk will not be keplerian any more and quasi - steady state solutions may not exist : accretion may be stopped and a state similar to the `` propeller '' phase for pulsars",
    "@xcite may be produced , or even the accretion flow is reversed @xcite .",
    "the instabilities of the disk plasma and the magnetic field may seriously affect the dynamics and energetics of the disk , which will make the situation much more complicated than that considered in this paper .",
    "the effect of photon capture caused by the black hole and the disk has also been ignored , which is expected to modify both the radiation flux and the total power of the disk .",

    "<S> . the limitations of our model are briefly discussed , which include the assumption of a weak magnetic field , the ignorance of the instabilities of the disk and the magnetic field , and the ignorance of the radiation captured by the black hole and the radiation returning to the disk . </S>"
