    "a large number of cosmological observations , obtained initially from distant type ia supernovae , have convincingly proven that the universe has undergone a late time accelerated expansion @xcite . in order to explain these observations",
    "a deep change in our paradigmatic understanding of the cosmological dynamics is necessary , and many ideas have been put forward to address them .",
    "the `` standard '' explanation of the late time acceleration is based on the assumption of the existence of a mysterious component , called dark energy , which is responsible for the observed characteristics of the late time evolution of the universe .    on the other hand , the combination of the results of the observations of high redshift supernovae , and of the wmap and of the recently released planck data ,",
    "indicate that the location of the first acoustic peak in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation is consistent with the prediction of the inflationary model for the density parameter @xmath0 , according to which @xmath1 .",
    "the cosmological observations also provide strong evidence for the behavior of the parameter @xmath2 of the equation of state of the cosmological fluid , where @xmath3 is the pressure and @xmath4 is the density , as lying in the range @xmath5 @xcite .    in order to explain the observed cosmological dynamics ,",
    "it is assumed usually that the universe is dominated by two main components : cold ( pressureless ) dark matter ( cdm ) , and dark energy ( de ) with negative pressure , respectively .",
    "cdm contributes @xmath6 @xcite , and its introduction is mainly motivated by the necessity of theoretically explaining the galactic rotation curves and the large scale structure formation . on the other hand , de represents the major component of the universe , providing @xmath7 .",
    "dark energy is the major factor determining the recent acceleration of the universe , as observed from the study of the distant type ia supernovae @xcite . explaining the nature and properties of dark energy has become one of the most active fields of research in cosmology and theoretical physics , with a huge number of proposed de models ( for reviews see , for instance , @xcite ) .    one interesting possibility for explaining de are cosmological models containing a mixture of cold dark matter and quintessence , representing a slowly - varying , spatially inhomogeneous component @xcite . from a theoretical as well as a particle physics point of view the idea of quintessence",
    "can be implemented by assuming that it is the energy associated with a scalar field @xmath8 , having a self - interaction potential @xmath9 .",
    "when the potential energy density @xmath9 of the quintessence field is greater than the kinetic one , then it follows that the pressure @xmath10 associated to the quintessence @xmath8-field is negative .",
    "the properties of the quintessential cosmological models have been actively considered in the physical literature ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . as opposed to the cosmological constant of standard general relativity , the equation of state of the quintessence field changes dynamically with time @xcite .",
    "alternative models , in which the late - time acceleration can be driven by the kinetic energy of the scalar field , called @xmath11essence models , have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "scalar fields @xmath12 that are minimally coupled to gravity via a negative kinetic energy , can also explain the recent acceleration of the universe .",
    "interestingly enough , they allow values of the parameter of the equation of state with @xmath13 . these types of scalar fields , known as phantom fields , have been proposed in @xcite . for phantom scalar fields",
    "the energy density and pressure are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the interesting properties of phantom cosmological models for dark energy have been investigated in detail in @xcite .",
    "recent cosmological observations show that at some moment during the cosmological evolution the value of the parameter @xmath16 may have crossed the standard value @xmath17 , corresponding to the general relativistic cosmological constant @xmath18 .",
    "this cosmological situation is called _ the phantom divide line crossing _ @xcite . in the case of scalar field models with cusped potentials ,",
    "the crossing of the phantom divide line was investigated in phan3 .",
    "another alternative way of explaining the phantom divide line crossing is to model dark energy by a scalar field , which is non - minimally coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "scalar fields are also assumed to play a fundamental role in the evolution of the very early universe , playing a major role in the inflationary scenario @xcite .",
    "originally , the idea of inflation was proposed to provide solutions to the singularity , flat space , horizon , and homogeneity problems , to the absence of magnetic monopoles , as well as to the problem of large numbers of particles @xcite .",
    "however , presently it is believed that the most important feature of inflation is the generation of both initial density perturbations and of the background cosmological gravitational waves .",
    "these important cosmological parameters can be determined in many different ways , like , for example , through the study of the anisotropies of the microwave background radiation , the analysis of the local ( peculiar ) velocity galactic flows , of the clustering of galaxies , and the determination of the abundance of gravitationally bound structures of different types , respectively @xcite .    in many inflationary models the dynamical evolution of the early universe",
    "is driven by a single scalar field , called the inflaton , with the inflaton rolling in some underlying self - interaction potential @xcite .",
    "one common approximation in the study of the inflationary evolution is the slow - roll approximation , which can be successfully used in two separate contexts .",
    "the first situation is in the study of the classical inflationary dynamics of expansion in the lowest order approximation .",
    "hence this implies that the contribution of the kinetic energy of the inflaton field to the expansion rate is ignored .",
    "the second situation is represented by the calculation of the perturbation spectra .",
    "the standard expressions deduced for these spectra are valid in the lowest order in the slow roll approximation @xcite .",
    "finding exact inflationary solutions of the gravitational field equations for different types of scalar field potentials is also of great importance for the understanding of the dynamics of the early universe .",
    "such exact solutions have been found for a large number of inflationary potentials .",
    "moreover , the potentials allowing a graceful exit from inflation have been classified @xcite .",
    "hence , the theoretical investigation of the scalar field models is an essential task in cosmology . among the various methods used to study the properties of scalar fields the methods based on the applications of the mathematical formalism of the qualitative study of dynamical systems",
    "is of considerable importance .",
    "the usefulness of dynamical systems formulation of physical models is mainly determined by their powerful predictive power .",
    "this predictive power is essentially determined by the stability of their solutions . in a realistic physical system , due to the limited precision of the measurements ,",
    "some uncertainties in the initial conditions always exist . therefore a physically meaningful mathematical model must also offer detailed and useful information on the evolution of the deviations of the possible trajectories of the dynamical system from a given reference trajectory .",
    "hence an important requirement in mathematical modelling is the understanding of the local stability of the physical and cosmological processes .",
    "this information on the system behavior is as important as the understanding of the late - time deviations .",
    "the global stability of the solutions of the dynamical systems described by systems of non - linear ordinary differential equations is analyzed in the framework of the well - known mathematical theory of lyapounov stability . in this mathematical approach",
    "the fundamental quantities that measure exponential deviations from a given trajectory are the so - called lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "it is usually very difficult to determine the lyapounov exponents analytically for a given dynamical system , and thus one must resort to numerical methods . on the other hand ,",
    "the important problem of the local stability of the solutions of dynamical systems , described by ordinary differential equations , is less understood .",
    "cosmological models have been intensively investigated by using methods from dynamical systems and lyapounov stability theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , phase space analysis proved to be a very useful method for the understanding of the cosmological evolution .",
    "when studying the evolution of cosmological models , the dynamical equations can be represented by an autonomous dynamical system , described by a set of coupled - usually strongly non - linear - differential equations for the physical parameters .",
    "this representation allows the study of the lyapunov stability of the model , without explicitly solving the field equations for the basic variables .",
    "furthermore , the importance of the lyapunov analysis is related to the fact that stationary points of the dynamical system correspond to exact or approximate analytic solutions of the field equations .",
    "thus the dynamical system formulation provide a useful tool for obtaining exact or approximate solutions of the field equations in cosmologically interesting situations .    even that the mathematical methods of the lyapounov stability analysis are well established , the study of the stability of the dynamical systems from different points of view is extremely important .",
    "the comparison of the results of the alternative approach with the corresponding lyapunov exponents analysis can provide a deeper understanding of the stability properties of the system .",
    "an alternative , and very powerful method for the study of the systems of the ordinary differential equations is represented by the so - called kosambi - cartan - chern ( kcc ) theory , which was initiated in the pioneering works of kosambi @xcite , cartan @xcite and chern @xcite , respectively .",
    "the kcc theory was inspired and influenced by the geometry of the finsler spaces ( for a recent review of the kcc theory see @xcite ) . from a mathematical point of view",
    "the kcc theory is a differential geometric theory of the variational equations for the deviations of the whole trajectory with respect to the nearby ones an00 . in the kcc geometrical description of the systems of ordinary differential equations one",
    "associates a non - linear connection , and a berwald type connection to the system of equations . with the use of these geometric quantities five",
    "geometrical invariants are obtained .",
    "the most important invariant is the second invariant , also called the curvature deviation tensor , which gives the jacobi stability of the system @xcite .",
    "the kcc theory has been applied for the study of different physical , biochemical or technical systems ( see @xcite .",
    "an alternative geometrization method for dynamical systems , with applications in classical mechanics and general relativity , was proposed in @xcite and @xcite , and further investigated in @xcite .",
    "the henon - heiles system and bianchi type ix cosmological models were also investigated within this framework .",
    "in particular , in @xcite a theoretical approach based on the geometrical description of dynamical systems and of their chaotic properties was developed .",
    "for the base manifold a finsler space was introduced , whose properties allow the description of a wide class of physical systems , including those with potentials depending on time and velocities , for which the riemannian approach is unsuitable .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider a systematic investigation of the jacobi stability properties of the flat homogeneous and isotropic general relativistic cosmological models . by starting from the standard friedmann equations we perform , as a first step in our analysis , a `` second geometrization '' of these equations , by associating to them a non - linear connection , and a berwald connection , respectively .",
    "this procedure allows to obtain the so - called kcc invariants of the friedmann equations .",
    "the second invariant , called the curvature deviation tensor , gives the jacobi stability properties of the cosmological model .",
    "the kcc theory can be naturally applied to systems of second order ordinary differential equations .",
    "the friedmann equations can be formulated as second order differential equations , similarly to the klein - gordon equation describing the scalar field . therefore the kcc theory can be applied to matter and scalar field dominated cosmological models .",
    "we obtain the general condition for the jacobi stability of scalar fields , which is described by two inequalities involving the second and the first derivative of the scalar field potential , the energy density of the field , as well as the time derivative of the field itself .",
    "the geodesic deviation equations describing the time variation of the deviation vector are also obtained . as an application of the developed formalism",
    "we investigate the stability properties of the scalar field cosmological models with exponential and higgs type potentials , respectively .",
    "it turns out that the exponential potential scalar field is jacobi unstable during its entire evolution , while the time evolution of the scalar field cosmological models with higgs potential show a complicated dynamics with alternating stable and unstable jacobi phases .",
    "the jacobi stability properties of the higgs type models are determined by the numerical value of the ratio of the self - coupling constant and the square of the mass of the higgs particle .",
    "the lyapunov stability properties of the scalar field cosmological models are usually investigated by reformulating the evolution equation as a set of three first order ordinary differential equations . in order to apply the kcc theory to such systems",
    "they must be lifted to the tangent bundle . from mathematical point of view",
    "this requires to take the time derivative of the first order equations , so that their `` second geometrization '' can be easily performed .",
    "we consider in detail the jacobi stability properties of the phantom quintessence and tachyon scalar field cosmological models .",
    "we study in detail the jacobi stability condition of these models , and we find that they are jacobi unstable during the entire expansionary cosmological evolution .    the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the basic ideas and the mathematical formalism of the kcc theory in section  [ kcc ] .",
    "the jacobi stability analysis of the homogenous isotropic flat cosmological models by using the second order formulation of the dynamics is performed in section  [ sect3 ] .",
    "we consider both the cases of the matter dominated and scalar field dominated cosmological models . as an application of the developed formalism we investigate in detail the jacobi stability of the scalar fields with exponential potential , and higgs potential , respectively .",
    "the jacobi stability of the first order dynamical system formulation of scalar field cosmological models is considered in section  refsect4 , in which the kcc geometrization of the phantom quintessence and tachyonic scalar field models is analyzed in detail .",
    "we discuss and conclude our results in section  sect5 .",
    "the kcc geometric quantities giving the geometric description of the phantom quintessence and tachyon scalar field cosmologies are presented in appendix [ appa ] and appendix  [ appb ] , respectively .",
    "in the present section we briefly summarize the basic concepts and results of the kcc theory ( for a detailed presentation see @xcite and @xcite ) .      in the following we denote by @xmath19 a real , smooth @xmath20-dimensional manifold , and by @xmath21 its tangent bundle . on an open connected subset @xmath22 of the euclidian @xmath23 dimensional space @xmath24",
