    "recent years have seen renewed interest in non - linear electrodynamics  @xcite , in particular born - infeld theory  @xcite , and its implications . unlike their maxwell counterparts ,",
    "the born - infeld field equations are _ fundamentally _ non - linear ; they are non - linear even in the vacuum . born and infeld introduced their theory  @xcite in order to ameliorate the singular self - energy of a point charge .",
    "furthermore , it was discovered that among the family of non - linear generalizations of maxwell electrodynamics , born - infeld theory possesses a number of highly attractive features ; in particular , like the vacuum maxwell equations , the vacuum born - infeld equations exhibit zero birefringence and its solutions have exceptional causal behaviour  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , born - infeld theory shares a number of properties with the low energy dynamics of strings and branes  @xcite .",
    "some of the most extreme conditions ever encountered in a terrestrial laboratory are created when high - power laser pulses interact with matter .",
    "the laser pulse immediately vaporizes the matter to form an intense laser - plasma providing novel avenues for generating intense bursts of coherent electromagnetic radiation for a wide range of applications in biological and material science  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , laser - plasmas permit controllable investigation of matter in extreme conditions that only occur naturally away from the earth .",
    "it is expected that the next generation of ultra - intense lasers will , for the first time , allow controllable access to regimes where a host of different quantum electrodynamic phenomena will be evident  @xcite and theories of non - linear electrodynamics will be central to their study .",
    "however , it is conceivable that born - infeld electrodynamics may play a role before it is necessary to invoke quantum electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent analyses of the propagation of born - infeld electromagnetic waves in waveguides  @xcite and in background uniform magnetic fields  @xcite , this article is addresses aspects of the non - linear electrodynamics of laser - plasmas .",
    "a sufficiently short and intense laser pulse propagating through a plasma may create a travelling longitudinal plasma wave whose velocity is approximately the same as the laser pulse s group velocity .",
    "however , it is not possible to sustain arbitrarily large electric fields ; substantial numbers of plasma electrons become trapped in the wave and are accelerated , which dampens the wave ( the wave ` breaks ' ) . early theoretical investigation of non - linear plasma waves was undertaken by akhiezer and polovin  @xcite , and later expounded by dawson  @xcite in the context of wave - breaking .",
    "wave - breaking is a fundamentally non - linear phenomenon , and it is natural to explore the properties of born - infeld plasmas from this perspective . for simplicity , in the present article",
    "we adopt the _ cold _ plasma model for the electron fluid and generalize well - known results  @xcite , for the cold maxwell plasma , to the context of non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "in particular , we obtain an exact expression for the maximum electric field of electrostatic oscillations in a cold born - infeld plasma and analyse the wavelength and frequency of those oscillations .",
    "there are numerous discussions of electrostatic waves in a warm maxwell plasma ; for example , see  @xcite .",
    "we employ the einstein summation convention throughout this article .",
    "latin indices @xmath0 run over @xmath1 and units are used in which the speed of light @xmath2 and the permittivity of the vacuum @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be an inertial coordinate system on minkowski spacetime @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the proper time of observers at fixed cartesian coordinates @xmath7 in the laboratory .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath8 has the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 and the hodge map @xmath11 is induced from the @xmath12-form @xmath13 on @xmath14 where @xmath15    the plasma electrons are represented as a cold relativistic fluid ; their worldlines are trajectories of the unit normalized future - pointing timelike @xmath12-vector field @xmath16 on @xmath17 and the @xmath18-form @xmath19 is their proper number density .",
    "we are interested in the evolution of a plasma over timescales during which the motion of the ions is negligible in comparison with the motion of the electrons , and we assume that the ions are at rest and distributed homogeneously in the laboratory frame",
    ". their worldlines are trajectories of the vector field @xmath20 on @xmath17 where @xmath21 is the ion number density ( a positive constant ) in the laboratory frame .",
    "maxwell s equations may be written covariantly as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the charge on the electron and @xmath24 is the charge on an ion with @xmath25 the multiplicity of the ionization .",

    "the maxwell @xmath32-form @xmath33 encodes the electric field @xmath34 and the magnetic induction @xmath35 ; the excitation @xmath32-form @xmath36 encodes the electric displacement @xmath37 and the magnetic field @xmath38 . in maxwell electrodynamics @xmath39 in the vacuum ; however , in born - infeld electrodynamics ( [ maxwell ] ) is retained but the constitutive relations for @xmath40 in terms of @xmath41 are non - linear in the vacuum . in born - infeld electrodynamics",
    "the constitutive relation for @xmath36 in terms of @xmath33 is @xmath42 where the invariants @xmath43 and @xmath44 are @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a new constant of nature .    to motivate the field equations used herein , we begin section  [ section : action_principle ] by developing them using an unconstrained action principle  @xcite .",
    "we will briefly review how ( [ bi_constitutive ] ) arises and show that @xmath16 satisfies the field equations @xmath47 for a relativistic cold electron fluid , where @xmath48 is the lorentz @xmath12-force acting on the electron fluid , @xmath49 is the interior product with respect to @xmath16 , @xmath50 is the electron rest mass and @xmath51 is the levi - civita connection on @xmath17 .",
