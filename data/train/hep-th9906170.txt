    "much effort has been devoted in recent years to fully understand the consequences as well as the mathematical subtleties of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect @xcite .",
    "the motivations range from different areas as low dimensional condensed matter physics ( e.g. in the study of anyons ) @xcite to cosmic string models @xcite and have both experimental @xcite and theoretical overtones .",
    "the conceptual aspects are not less interesting as we briefly illustrate . basically due to the use of different boundary conditions , to achieve accordance between the exact and the perturbative calculations in the case of spin zero particles , it was necessary to include in the perturbative method a contact delta like interaction . in 2 + 1 dimensions , within the chern - simons @xcite field theory approach",
    ", it was shown that the contact interaction may be simulated by a quartic self - interaction of the matter field , with a coupling tuned to eliminate divergences and restore the conformal invariance of the tree approximation @xcite .",
    "for the scattering of two spin up fermions it was verified @xcite that an additional self - interaction was not needed since its role was provided by pauli s magnetic term . however , if the fermions had anti - parallel spins the effect of the magnetic interaction canceled and a divergence showed up .",
    "these problems were studied in a relativistic quantum field theory approach @xcite . differently from the non - relativistic calculations",
    "previously mentioned , without any additional hypothesis , the scattering amplitudes are finite for both parallel and anti - parallel spin fermions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend these investigations by considering the ab scattering of spin 1/2 particles by an external flux tube , directly in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we calculate the elastic cross section , in first order born approximation in the ab potential , including radiative corrections up to order @xmath0 . the second order born approximation is also calculated and found to vanish .",
    "infrared divergences of the elastic cross section , are eliminated from the observable scattering process by considering the inclusive  cross section , which besides the elastic process , also incorporates soft photon bremsstrahlung contributions .",
    "the discussion of vacuum polarization effects allows us to correct the original ab potential , showing a screening of the magnetic flux and the induction of a magnetic field outside of the original flux tube .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sa ] we introduce the model , calculate the first order born approximation including radiative corrections up to order @xmath0 , calculate the second order born approximation , and the finite inclusive cross section including soft photon bremsstrahlung . in sec .",
    "[ sb ] we obtain , up to the same order , the radiatively corrected ab potential , and the induced magnetic field outside the flux tube .",
    "some comments are made in the conclusions .",

    "the magnetic flux tube is located at the @xmath5-axis , and the ab potential can be chosen as ( the index @xmath6 stands for transverse  to the @xmath5-axis )    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the magnetic flux , and diag@xmath9 . repeated greek indices sum from 0 to 3 , while repeated latin indices from the beginning and from the middle of the alphabet sum from 1 to 3 and from 1 to 2 , respectively .",

    "the ab potential satisfies the coulomb gauge condition , @xmath12 , and in cylindrical polar coordinates it reads @xmath13 .",
    "starting from the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) , there are in principle two ways to proceed : one could try to construct the exact feynman propagator in the background potential ( [ 2 ] ) , and then evaluate the radiative corrections to the scattering amplitude , or one can resort to a perturbative calculation both in @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the present paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the second approach .",
    "specifically , we have to calculate the first order born amplitude in @xmath16 plus radiative corrections up to order @xmath0 , hereafter designated by @xmath17 and add these contributions to the second order born amplitude in @xmath16 , designated by @xmath18 ( see figure * 1 * ) :    @xmath19    since the scattering process conserves the energy and the z - component of the three - momentum we will consider the case of incidence perpendicular to the solenoid .",
