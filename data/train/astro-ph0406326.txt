    "the trapezium cluster is an extremely young and rich embedded cluster at the heart of the great orion nebula . discovered in early infrared images by trumpler ( 1931 ) and baade and minkowski ( 1937 ) , it is the best studied of all embedded clusters . with age of approximately 10@xmath8 years it remains one of the most important laboratories for investigations of star formation and early stellar evolution in our galaxy .",
    "in particular , the cluster has a well determined and well sampled imf ranging from o stars to substellar objects near the dueterium burning limit ( e.g. , muench et al . 2000 , 2002 ; lucas & roche 2000 ; luhman et al .",
    "2000 , hillenbrand & carpenter 2000 ) .",
    "this enables the statistically significant examination of a number of important astrophysical questions , such as the origin and nature of the imf , the frequencies of circumstellar disks and protostars in a young population , and the origin of stellar multiplicity in the earliest stages of stellar evolution .",
    "infrared imaging observations of embedded clusters are particularly well suited for addressing such issues ( lada & lada 2003 ) . in a previous infrared imaging study lada et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained extensive _",
    "photometry of the cluster .",
    "these observations were used both to measure the frequency of infrared excess emission in order to constrain the circumstellar disk fraction in the cluster population and to identify heavily buried protostellar candidates in this young region .",
    "they found a relatively high excess fraction of @xmath9 80% for the cluster membership , indicating that the vast majority of stars in the cluster were born surrounded by protoplanetary disks .",
    "their observations also revealed a new population of heavily reddened objects deeply buried in molecular gas behind the main cluster .",
    "these sources are probably extremely young and mark the location of the most recent and active star formation in the orion nebula region .",
    "an appreciable fraction of these sources could be protostellar objects .    for cluster members for which spectra were available , lada et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that the high excess fraction at l - band ( 3.5 @xmath0 m ) was independent of spectral type and thus stellar mass , for stars later than type a. indeed , the excess / disk fraction remained high down to the lowest mass objects near the hydrogen burning limit ( hbl ) .",
    "this raised the interesting question of whether substellar objects were also born with circumstellar disks .",
    "the answer to this question could provide important clues concerning the nature and formation of brown dwarfs ( muench et al .",
    "2001 , reipurth & clarke 2002 ) .",
    "although the @xmath5-band observations of lada et al . were not sensitive enough to examine a statistically significant sample of objects with substellar luminosities , they did indicate that 8 of 10 objects with spectral types later than m6 exhibited strong @xmath5-band excess . since m6 ( e.g. , luhman et al . 1998 ) is the expected spectral type of a young pms star at the hbl , this result suggested the possibility that both stellar and substellar objects form surrounded by dusty disks .",
    "indeed , examining deeper @xmath10 observations of the trapezium , muench et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found @xmath11-band ( 2.16 @xmath0 m ) excesses around a significant fraction ( @xmath9 65% ) of the cluster members with substellar luminosities .",
    "the fact that many of these brown dwarf candidates with k - band excesses were spatially coincident with optically identified _ hubble space telescope",
    "_ `` proplyds '' ( e.g. , bally , odell & mccaughrean 2000 ) indicated that these substellar candidates were indeed surrounded by disks . the excess / disk fraction implied by the muench et al .",
    "data was somewhat lower than that derived for the stellar objects in the cluster from the @xmath12 band observations , but higher than predicted by disk models for brown dwarfs which produce smaller amounts of excess emission at @xmath13-band ( e.g. , walker et al . 2004 ; natta et al .",
    "moreover , a number of the brown dwarf excess sources were found to lie well below the expected disk locus on the @xmath10 color - color diagram , also inconsistent with expectations of circumstellar disk models . because the magnitude of the infrared excess from a disk increases with wavelength and only very small amounts of dust are required to produce optically thick emission in the 3 - 5@xmath0 m range , @xmath5 band is the optimum wavelength for detecting infrared excesses from circumstellar disks using ground - based telescopes ( haisch , lada & lada 2001 , wood et al .",
    "to better constrain the excess / disk fraction for the substellar population of the trapezium cluster requires an extension of the previous l band imaging survey into the brown dwarf regime .",
    "deeper @xmath5 band observations would also be capable of improving our knowledge and understanding of the deeply embedded population behind the cluster .",
    "do these objects represent a continuation of the cluster forming process that produced the more revealed trapezium cluster ?",
    "if so , then their observation may provide interesting insights concerning the nature of the physical mechanism of cluster formation .",
    "for example , scally and clarke ( 2002 ) have argued that the trapezium cluster could have been formed from the merger of numerous small primordial subclusters . in this case",
    "we might expect to directly detect such subclustering in the embedded population .",
    "observation of structure or the lack of it in the embedded population can thus provide important constraints on models of cluster formation . to obtain a sufficiently deep 3 @xmath0 m survey of the trapezium cluster requires a large telescope , a sensitive array of @xmath5 band detectors and the best seeing possible .",
    "to achieve these goals we obtained observations of a significant portion of the trapezium cluster with the eso vlt using an @xmath1 ( 3.78@xmath0 m ) filter under conditions of good seeing . in this paper",
    "we present these data , their analysis and implications for understanding the nature of extremely young brown dwarfs and the early stages of cluster formation .",
    "we obtained deep imaging of the trapezium cluster in the @xmath14 band at 3.78 @xmath0 m using the infrared spectrometer and array camera , isaac ( moorwood et al .",
    "1998 ) , at the vlt ut1 telescope . in order to obtain the best seeing conditions at paranal",
    "the observing program was carried out in service mode and data acquisition took place during several nights of good seeing during the southern summer of 2002 .",
    "the @xmath14-band sky coverage is shown in figure 1 .",
    "table 1 is a log of the observations and lists the positions , integration times and the measured seeing sizes ( fwhm ) for each of the fields .    to remove the sky at the @xmath14-band we observed in chopping mode using the vlt chopping secondary mirror in phase with the detector readout . to obtain a difference image",
    "the telescope was also nodded 20 arcsec in right ascension in a standard abba pattern .",
    "the chopping throw was 20 arcsec in right ascension at a frequency of 0.43 s@xmath15 .",
    "each on and off image consisted of 9 coadded frames with an integration time of 0.11 seconds per frame .",
    "each nod consisted of 15 chop ( on - off ) cycles .",
    "each observation consisted of 15 abba nod cycles with a random jitter of up to 20 arcsec between abba sets .",
    "this resulted in a total integration of typically 29.7 minutes for stars observed in both the on and off chop beams .",
    "this observing technique gives the best sky subtraction in the @xmath14-band , although it generates a final image that contains many negative sources resulting from sky beam counterparts at the chopping distances .",
    "despite this very few known sources ( 15 ) fell into negative images in the reduced chopped image .    because the chop throw was smaller than an individual image",
    ", most stars appeared in both the on and off images and were thus observed twice in each cycle . to take advantage of this each member of the on - off cycle",
    "was sky subtracted using the other member of the cycle as a sky to produce two positive images of a target star for each chopped cycle .",
    "these images were then flat fielded using sky flats .",
    "the flattened images were then appropriately shifted and stacked to produce the final combined image , which typically consisted of a total of 120 observations of each star .",
    "this procedure resulted in the production of a final image that was rectangular ( @xmath9 135 x 85 arcsec ) in shape .",
    "some of our final combined images contained only 118 observations since occasional problems with the chopping secondary resulted in the production elongated images on some frames and the few observations with such poor images were discarded before the final image was constructed .",
    "figure 2 displays the combined chopped @xmath1 band image for one of our fields ( l5 ) and illustrates the quality of the final images .",
    "the seeing was typically below 0.5 arcsec .",
    "sources were identified by visual inspection of the vlt chopped images and by comparison to the locations of sources known from published near - infrared catalogs ( e.g. , muench et al 2002 , hillenbrand & carpenter 2000 ) . our final catalog consisted of 424 sources with measurable @xmath1 photometry ; indeed , only 15 known sources were not detected due to negative chop images while 7 bright sources were saturated . by comparison",
    "to ground - based @xmath10 surveys we find that we detected @xmath16 of the known sources brighter than @xmath17 ( see also figure [ fig : vlt_cmds]b ) .",
    "further , 15 new @xmath1-only sources were identified with the vast majority of them projected along the omc-1 cloud core .",
    "last , @xmath18 individual sources appeared on two or more vlt images ( see figure [ fig : area ] ) , yielding quality checks on the photometric and positional accuracy of our final catalog .",
    "the iraf appphot package was used to obtain aperture photometry at a large range of radii ( @xmath19 pixels ) and with a sky annulus from @xmath20 pixels .",
    "corresponding aperture corrections were calculated using the mkapfile routine and 10 - 20 bright sources for each vlt image , although the images relatively similar psfs yielded similar corrections .",
    "for this reason , we chose the 8 pixel aperture photometry for all sources , corresponding to a beamsize of @xmath21 and a typical aperture correction of @xmath22 magnitudes .",
    "the 8 pxiel photometry of 13 sources were affected by negative chop images and/or bright stars in the wings of their psfs ; their photometry was adjusted to an appropriately smaller beamsize .",
    "zeropoint calibration was performed using standard star observations obtained on 3 of the 4 queue observing nights , and photometric zeropoint offsets between frames as revealed by sources in overlap images were removed by cross - calibration to the photometry of the l1 position .",
    "our quoted photometric accuracy as derived from overlap sources is @xmath23 .",
    "sources were placed onto the 2mass astrometric grid using plate solutions derived with iraf routine ccmap from 30 - 60 sources on each reduced image .",
    "formal rms errors of these solutions were @xmath24 ; however , sources in overlap regions reveal a smaller relative scatter of order @xmath25 .",
    "the final catalog is available in electronic format with table [ tab : catalog ] representative of its contents . to preserve positional information lost in the astrometric plate solutions , we provide both equatorial coordinates and pixel positions of each source ( on a specific vlt image ) .",
    "sources are also cross - referenced to the flwo - ntt ( muench et al 2002 ) , hillenbrand & carpenter ( 2000 ) and hillenbrand ( 1997 ) identifications .",
    "in order to describe the population of @xmath1 sources in our survey region , illustrate the sensitivity of our vlt observations , and select the candidate substellar population in the cluster we present the @xmath7 vs @xmath13 and @xmath26 vs @xmath27 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in figure [ fig : vlt_cmds ] .",
    "a total of 400 sources are detected and resolved in @xmath13 and @xmath1 passbands ; these are plotted in figure [ fig : vlt_cmds]a .",
    "most sources have @xmath28 ; however , a significant population of sources have much larger colors , with a handful of sources characterized by extremely red colors ( i.e. , 5 @xmath29 @xmath7 @xmath29 6 magnitudes ) suggesting reddenings up to @xmath30 .",
    "it is unclear if the inferred reddenings to these extreme sources are due to pure dust extinction or strong infrared excess emission of the kind that is often associated with protostellar objects , since the reddest of these are not detected at @xmath31 or @xmath27 bands .",
    "similar to lada et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we define the depth of our survey by our ability to detect the photospheres of cluster members . in figure",
    "[ fig : vlt_cmds]b we plot the @xmath26 vs @xmath27 color - magnitude diagram for all sources known from previous deep ir surveys within the boundaries of the vlt @xmath1 survey .",
    "presuming that the @xmath27 magnitude of these sources is primarily photospheric , we clearly detect the vast majority of sources down to @xmath32 , below which our observations are quite incomplete . alternately , we are sensitive to the photosphere of a 1 myr brown dwarf ( @xmath33 ; baraffe et al 1998 ) seen through 20 visual magnitudes of extinction .",
    "muench et al .",
    "( 2001 ) defined a sample of trapezium sources that were postulated to be sub - stellar based on their unreddened @xmath27 band luminosity from the 1 myr isochrone of baraffe et al .",
    "the validity of that cmd analysis was bolstered by the fact that the luminosity selected sources were on the whole fainter than members with spectral types earlier than m6 .",
    "following muench et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we use the @xmath27 vs @xmath26 color - magnitude diagram to identify candidate brown dwarfs in the trapezium cluster by comparing their infrared luminosities to the predictions of the baraffe et al . models .",
    "we consider all sources whose dereddened luminosities are less than the the predicted luminosity of the hbl for the adopted age ( 10@xmath8 yrs ) and distance ( 400 pc ) of the cluster . by considering all sources below the the extrapolated reddening vector for the hbl we identify 38 sources as substellar candidates in our vlt fields .",
    "however we note that this sample represents an upper limit to the true number of substellar cluster members that we detected at @xmath1 since we have not accounted for background / foreground field star contamination which is predicted to be significant at these faint magnitudes .",
    "for example , muench et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimated , by combining observations of control fields near but off the cluster and a model of the extinction distribution produced by the molecular cloud , that field stars account for as much as 20 - 30 % of the objects in this magnitude range .",
    "in earlier studies lada et al ( 2000 ) and muench et al ( 2001 ) used @xmath12 and @xmath4 color - color ( cc ) diagrams , respectively , to diagnosis the presence of infrared excess due to disks around stellar and candidate substellar members of the trapezium cluster .",
    "we now extend their analysis to include high dynamic range vlt @xmath1 data to better assess the infrared excess fraction across the hbl and into the substellar regime . in figure",
    "[ fig : vlt_jhkl ] we present the @xmath4 and @xmath3 infrared cc diagrams for the vlt @xmath1 trapezium sources .",
    "there are a total of 345 sources with @xmath34 photometry .",
    "sources represented by filled circles are the 38 luminosity selected substellar candidates from the @xmath27 vs @xmath26 color - magnitude diagram . plotted for comparison",
    "is the intrinsic locus for dwarfs taken from a merger of optical and ir colors from winkler ( 1997 ) , kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) , bessell & brett ( 1988 ) and leggett ( 1992 ) . reddening vectors ( whittet 1989 ) for the giant branch and m6 and m9 dwarfs are also shown .    although many sources display colors consistent with reddened photospheric colors , a large fraction ( 50% and 67% , respectively ) display infrared excess relative to the m6 reddening vector on both the @xmath10 and @xmath34 cc diagrams .",
    "as expected , the excess fraction is found to be higher in the latter cc diagram .",
    "for the candidate 10@xmath8 year old substellar population we expect most objects to have spectral types of m6 or later ( luhman et al .",
    "since most of the stars plotted in figure [ fig : vlt_jhkl ] are more luminous than the hbl , and thus likely to be earlier than m6 , those that appear in the infrared excess region of the cc diagrams ( lada & adams 1992 ) must be characterized by significant @xmath26 and @xmath7 excesses . identifying infrared excess for substellar objects , particularly in the @xmath34 cc diagram ,",
    "is a much more difficult task than for it is for stars above the hbl .",
    "this is because the range of intrinsic @xmath7 colors for m6-m9 dwarfs is relatively large and , in fact , comparable to the entire range in intrinsic @xmath35 colors for all earlier spectral types and moreover larger than the corresponding @xmath26 intrinsic color spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , a significant fraction ( 42% ) of the substellar candidates fall to the right of the m9 reddening vector on the @xmath34 cc diagram and consequently have significant @xmath7 excess . a similarly high fraction ( 44% ) of substellar candidates display excesses in the @xmath10 cc diagram with respect to the m9 reddening vector .",
    "this relatively high fraction from the @xmath10 cc diagram is roughly consistent with the findings of muench et al .",
    "( 2001 ) but inconsistent with expectations of disk models , as mentioned earlier .",
    "we also note that about 1/3 of the luminosity selected substellar objects have colors apparently consistent with reddened stars of spectral type earlier than m6 .",
    "some of these sources are likely field stars . for others their relatively blue colors",
    "could be the result of photometric uncertainties in the observed colors .",
    "moreover , the @xmath10 observations were obtained at a different epoch than the @xmath1 observations , and consequently variability , if present , could contaminate some of the @xmath7 colors .",
    "in addition , this result is also reminiscent of the recent spectroscopic study of slesnick , hillenbrand and carpenter ( 2004 ) who found a similar sized fraction of luminosity selected substellar candidates in the trapezium cluster to be characterized by spectral types earlier than the nominal m6 substellar boundary .",
    "the nature of this apparently subluminous stellar population is unknown .",
    "both our cc diagrams also show sources which fall into relatively forbidden regions of the diagrams . in figure",
    "[ fig : vlt_jhkl]a there is a population of sources with very red @xmath26 colors and relatively blue @xmath36 colors .",
    "some of these same sources also appear to be unexpectedly blue in @xmath7 color in figure [ fig : vlt_jhkl]b ; as was discussed in lada et al ( 2000 ) and muench et al ( 2001 ) many of these sources are proplyds ( odell wen & hu 1993 ) and their colors are possibly contaminated by scattered light and/or emission from the photoionized envelopes surrounding the underlying disks .    to further investigate the behavior of the infrared excess / disk fraction across the hbl we divided the source distribution in the @xmath26 vs @xmath27 cmd into 7 luminosity bands , approximating equal sized steps in unreddened @xmath27 magnitude and logarithmic mass using predicted @xmath37 magnitudes from the the baraffe et al ( 1998 ) 1 myr isochrone .",
    "the magnitude bins and corresponding predicted masses are listed in table [ tab : trap_cc ] .",
    "we further constructed an extinction limited sample by including in each bin only sources with extinctions @xmath38 .",
    "the fraction of sources in each luminosity selected bin displaying infrared excess greater than their formal 1 sigma photometric errors was counted in the corresponding @xmath10 , @xmath34 and @xmath39 color - color diagrams .",
    "the m6 spectral type boundary was used to calculate the infrared excess fraction for all bins .",
    "in addition for bins 5 - 7 the infrared excess fraction was also calculated using the m9 boundary , since these bins are likely to contain brown dwarfs .",
    "the corresponding excess fractions are listed in table [ tab : trap_cc ] , while in figure [ fig : trap_cc_irx ] we plot these fractions as a function of the luminosity bin center .",
    "clearly , trapezium sources display excess at all magnitudes and in all diagrams with the @xmath34 and @xmath39 diagrams giving nearly identical results . as already shown by lada et al ( 2000 )",
    ", the fraction of bright sources displaying excess is larger when using @xmath6 as a color diagnostic . )",
    "sources showing excess in these diagrams appears lower than published in lada et al ( 2000 ) for two reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath40 bandpass of the vlt data yields redder photospheric colors than the @xmath41 bandpass of the flwo data making the identification of a infrared excess somewhat more difficult at @xmath1 for late spectral types .",
    "second , we are consistently counting from the m6 rather than the m5 boundary used lada et al ( 2000 ) ] yet as @xmath37 increases into the fiducial brown dwarf regime ( band 5 - 7 ) , the excess fraction traced by @xmath7 appears to decrease , although the uncertainty in the excess fraction increases due the larger range of intrinsic @xmath6 colors for m6-m9 sources .",
    "note , our results for band 7 are likely upper limits because of incompleteness , which manifests itself in our ability to detect only those faint sources with disks .",
    "this decrease in @xmath6 excess fraction is _ opposite _ the behavior traced by @xmath26 , which increases for the brown dwarf luminosity bins and recovers the @xmath42 excess fraction quoted by muench et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "the physical origin of this difference in behavior is unknown . nonetheless , the @xmath1 measurements indicate a relatively high infrared excess and likely disk fraction for the substellar population of this cluster . merging the results for luminosity bands 6 and 7 from table 2 we estimate an infrared excess fraction for the substellar population of the cluster of 50 @xmath2 20 % from the @xmath34 diagram .",
    "our measurements also hint that the disk fraction for the substellar population is somewhat lower than that of the stellar population .",
    "however , considering the uncertainties and the possible effects of field star contamination , one can not yet draw a firm conclusion about the presence of a decrease in excess fraction for the substellar population in the cluster .",
    "there are a number of limitations to our estimate of the excess / disk fraction for the substellar population from our vlt @xmath1 data .",
    "first , our measurements of the excess fraction are incomplete for the lowest luminosity bin resulting in an overestimate for the excess fraction in that bin .",
    "second , the lack of specific knowledge about the intrinsic infrared colors of the objects results in the relatively large quoted uncertainties ( @xmath43 ) for our estimate of the excess fraction of the luminosity selected substellar candidates .",
    "the lack of knowledge of source intrinsic color also presumably affects the derived excess fraction at brighter magnitudes as well since an m0 star , for example , will require 0.3 magnitudes of @xmath6 excess in order to be counted as an excess source using the m6 boundary .",
    "given that any age spread for trapezium members will result in a mix of mass ( as traced by spectral type ) as a function of luminosity , assigning a single spectral type boundary only acts to underestimate the true excess fraction .",
    "in addition we have not attempted to correct for foreground / background source contamination which is likely present for these faint sources .",
    "the presence of such contaminating sources also results in an underestimate of the true excess fraction .",
    "liu et al . ( 2003 ) have shown that a more complete assessment of infrared excess in substellar sources can be made if the spectral types and thus the intrinsic colors of the stars are individually known and taken into account in measuring infrared excess emission . combining spectra with infrared @xmath34 photometry of substellar candidates in taurus and ic 348 ,",
    "liu et al . ( 2003 ) derived a @xmath7 band excess / disk fraction of 77% for stars they selected with late spectral types .",
    "this was a significantly higher fraction than that ( @xmath9 33% ) inferred from analysis of the @xmath34 cc diagram for the same sources .",
    "therefore it would be extremely valuable to examine the infrared colors of those substellar candidates in the trapezium that have been spectroscopically classified so that their intrinsic infrared colors are known .    over the past few years",
    "various workers have collected spectra of faint stars in the trapezium cluster ( i.e. , hillenbrand , 1997 ; lucas et al .",
    "2001 ; luhman et al .",
    "2000 ; slesnick , hillenbrand and carpenter , 2004 ) . from these studies",
    "we find a total of 24 objects with spectral types of m6 or later that were also detected in our @xmath1 images . in figure [ cc_w_spectra ]",
    "we show the @xmath4 and @xmath3 cc diagrams for this spectroscopically selected sample of substellar candidates . with the assumption of dwarf colors for the spectroscopically selected sample",
    "we can convert the spectral types to intrinsic substellar colors .",
    "with knowledge of the spectroscopically derived intrinsic @xmath44 colors of the stars , we derive an excess fraction of 70% @xmath2 15% from comparison with their observed @xmath44 colors .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the fraction derived by muench et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from photometry using the @xmath4 cc diagram and roughly consistent with our estimate based solely on @xmath4 photometry of sources detected at @xmath1 .",
    "however this value is higher than would be expected by traditional disk models . using the @xmath45 data we derive in a similar manner an excess fraction of 52% @xmath2 20 % for the spectoscopically selected substellar candidates .",
    "although this represents a significant excess fraction , the calculated value is formally lower than both the fraction derived by liu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for taurus and ic 348 using @xmath7 colors and the fraction derived for the same sources from our @xmath4 colors .",
    "however given the relatively large uncertainties it is difficult to assess the significance of this difference .",
    "moreover it is difficult to compare the results between our spectroscopically selected trapezium sample and the liu et al .",
    "@xmath1 ic 348 plus taurus sample , since neither can be considered complete and may not even be fully representative of the entire substellar populations in the respective clouds .",
    "finally , an additional uncertainty may arise from our assumption of dwarf colors for these objects since they are expected to have lower surface gravities than field dwarfs .",
    "theoretical models predict that lower surface gravity stars should have somewhat bluer @xmath6 colors , leading to an underestimate of the excess fraction when assuming dwarf colors ( liu et al .",
    "we find that these same model atmospheres ( i.e. , baraffe et al .",
    "2002 ) predict slightly bluer @xmath36 colors and no change in the @xmath26 colors for lower surface gravity atmospheres with the result that the excess fraction derived assuming dwarf colors is not significantly altered .",
    "the relatively large excess fraction derived from @xmath10 colors is unexpected and as speculated earlier by muench et al .",
    "( 2001 ) may be the result of scattered light or emission from the photoionized envelopes of the disks , since many of the sources with these colors appear to be proplyds .",
    "the @xmath5 band imaging survey of lada et al ( 2000 ) resulted in the identification of a previously unrecognized population of heavily reddened objects toward the trapezium cluster .",
    "seventy - eight sources were found to have large @xmath6 colors ( i.e. , @xmath6 > 1.5 mag . ) suggestive of objects deeply embedded in molecular gas and dust .",
    "for example , for a normal interstellar reddening law ( e.g , mathis 1990 ) this would correspond to @xmath46 @xmath47 27 magnitudes for a typical naked field star seen through the cloud and approximately @xmath46 @xmath47 15 magnitudes for a young star with a circumstellar disk .",
    "the spatial distribution of these red objects was found to differ from that of the bulk of the ( less reddened , @xmath48 5 mag . )",
    "cluster membership , but to be similar to that of the dense molecular ridge located behind the cluster .",
    "the molecular ridge has long been known to be a site of star formation , haboring the massive protostellar objects irc2 and bn - kl .",
    "the @xmath5 band survey indicated that the star formation activity in the ridge was considerably more active than previously suspected .",
    "many of the new and heavily buried sources were found to be characterized by the extreme infrared excess in the @xmath12 cc diagram often observed in protostars .",
    "our deeper @xmath1 observations have revealed 73 objects with @xmath7 @xmath47 1.5 magnitudes and 40 with @xmath7 @xmath47 2.0 magnitudes within the six fields we imaged . within these fields",
    "25 objects were identified as having @xmath6 @xmath47 1.5 magnitudes in the earlier survey by lada et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and 48 are newly identified members of the deeply embedded population ( most of which were below the @xmath5 band sensitivity limit in the previous survey ) . together with the earlier data of lada et al .",
    ", our observations indicate that that deeply embedded population consists of approximately 126 members , roughly 20% the size of the foreground and more revealed trapezium cluster .",
    "the vlt sources with @xmath7 @xmath47 1.5 magnitudes are plotted as filled squares in figure 1 .",
    "these sources form a tight distribution that more or less follows the molecular ridge ( see figure 7 of lada et al .",
    "2000 and also johnstone & bally 1999 ) .",
    "the extremely high extinctions inferrred for these sources coupled with their relatively high surface density , clearly indicates that the vast majority are embedded in the cloud and not reddened background field stars .",
    "moreover , the reddest of these sources have @xmath7 colors suggestive of visual extinctions of up to 100 magnitudes !",
    "such extreme extinctions typically arise from dense envelopes of deeply embedded protostellar objects and not from the more distributed dense gas of a molecular cloud core .",
    "as suggested by lada et al ( 2000 ) many such objects are likely protostellar in nature and still in the process of forming .",
    "in addition our new observations revealed 15 previously undetected @xmath1  only sources , plotted as filled diamonds in figure 1 . as seen in this figure twelve of these",
    "are found coincident with the molecular ridge and are likely additional members of the deeply embedded population .",
    "the brightest of these is the source vlt-129 ( @xmath49 ) which lies @xmath50 southwest of the bnkl and is characterized by a @xmath7 color of @xmath47 6 magnitudes .",
    "the population of deeply embedded objects ( deos ) traces the most recent epoch of star formation in the trapezium cluster region .",
    "the spatial structure of the deeply embedded population possesses an imprint of the physical processes responsible for its creation and thus can provide important insights into the earliest phases of cluster formation process . in their study of embedded clusters lada & lada ( 2003 ) found that embedded clusters could be characterized by two basic structural types .",
    "type 1 clusters exhibited hierarchical spatial structure characterized by significant sub - clustering in their surface density distributions .",
    "such highly structured systems are thought to be a signature of the important role of turbulence in the evolution of molecular gas to form stars .",
    "type 2 clusters exhibited centrally - concentrated structure typically characterized by relatively smoothly varying radial surface density profiles .",
    "such centrally condensed structures are thought to be a signature of the global dominance of gravity in the formation of the stellar system .",
    "it is not clear whether these two types of structures represent two different primordial structures or two differing evolutionary states of an embedded cluster .",
    "most embedded clusters appear to be type 2 structures , yet most progenitor molecular clouds appear to be filamentary in shape and highly structured , at least on large scales .",
    "this perhaps suggests that centrally condensed type 2 structures may form from more structured type 1-like initial configurations .",
    "indeed , in a recent numerical simulation of cluster formation from a turbulent cloud , bate , bonnell and bromm ( 2003 ) found that filamentary clouds could form stars which fall together to form small groups within a larger cluster forming system .",
    "earlier numerical simulations by scally and clarke ( 2000 ) have suggested that relaxed , centrally condensed stellar clusters can form from the merger of smaller subclusters .",
    "they suggested that the orion nebula cluster ( and by implication the trapezium cluster which forms its inner core ) could have formed from the merger of subclusters provided that these subclusters were relatively small and numerous .",
    "existing surface density maps of the trapezium cluster suggest that it is a type 2 or centrally concentrated embedded cluster ( hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ; lada et al .",
    "2000 ; scally & clarke 2002 ) . in figure [ proto_cluster_map ]",
    "we plot the surface density distribution of the embedded population ( contours ) along with that of the less extincted members of the trapezium cluster ( grey scale ) .",
    "our deeper observations allow us to map these distributions at higher angular resolution than previously possible .",
    "the deeply embedded population is found to be significantly structured appearing to consist of five subclusters oriented more or less along the filamentary molecular ridge .",
    "the basic parameters of the subclusters are listed in table [ tab : subclusters ] these five subclusters account for approximately 55% of the stars in the deeply embedded population .",
    "if the formation of the deeply embedded population is a continuation of the same physical process that produced the foreground trapezium cluster , then it is tempting to identify the subclusters with the fundamental units or building blocks out of which the cluster continues to be assembled .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then it suggests that a centrally condensed cluster may be formed from the merger of smaller subclusters which themselves formed intitially in filamentary dense molecular gas in accord with the suggestion of scally and clarke ( 2002 ) .",
    "the deep infrared observations also allow us to examine the structure of the foreground trapezuim cluster in more detail than previously possible .",
    "infrared @xmath10 cc diagrams ( see figure 4 and lada et al . 2000 ,",
    "figure 8) show that the bulk of the trapezium cluster is characterized by extinctions less than about 5 - 6 magnitudes .",
    "therefore to map the structure of the foreground trapezium cluster we ploted in figure [ proto_cluster_map ] the spatial surface density distribution of stars with @xmath51 1.5 magnitudes ( corresponding to @xmath46s of approximately 10 magnitudes or less ) . the surface density map of the cluster is dominated by a strong central peak at the site of the trapezium ( n@xmath52 @xmath53 6000 pc@xmath54 ) , in agreement with previous studies .",
    "however , our higher resolution map reveals additional significant structure in the cluster .",
    "three secondary peaks with peak surface densities of 3000 pc@xmath54 or greater are found to the north and east of the primary peak .",
    "together the four subclusters account for about 28% of the total population of the foreground cluster .",
    "the basic parameters of these subclusters are also listed in table [ tab : subclusters ] .",
    "these secondary peaks are reminiscent of the satellite subclusters observed in ic 348 ( lada & lada 1995 ) another otherwise highly centrally concentrated embedded cluster .",
    "comparison of the embedded source and cluster surface density distributions generally confirms earlier results in that , for the most part , the two populations have different spatial distributions which are offset from one another . however , one peak in the deo distribution is coincident with the primary peak in the trapezium cluster distribution .",
    "although significant this peak in the deo distribution may not be in fact as prominent as it appears in the map since at least 3 of the sources in it are foreground proplyds with very red colors .",
    "in addition the strongest peak in the deo distribution , which is coincident with bn - kl region , is near , but offset from the second strongest peak in the foreground cluster distribution .",
    "thus it appears that at least some of the structure in the foreground trapezium cluster reflects the more primordial structure in the background embedded population .",
    "these observations suggest that the foreground trapezium cluster is still sufficiently young that it is not yet fully relaxed into a centrally condensed , isothermal - like stellar distribution .",
    "moreover , the presence of structure in the embedded source population suggests that the cluster will need to undergo still more structural evolution in order to eventually incoporate the presently embedded sub - clusters and form a fully relaxed and centrally concentrated stellar system .",
    "we have obtained deep 3.8 @xmath0  m @xmath1 observations of the trapezium cluster using the eso vlt .",
    "we have imaged a significant fraction of the inner 5 x 5  region of the cluster .",
    "our observations extend the previous @xmath5 band survey of lada et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to fainter cluster members and include approximately 38 objects with luminosities below that expected for cluster members at the hbl .",
    "in addition , we detected 24 objects with previously known spectral types that are later than that corresponding to the hbl ( m6 ) . combining our deep @xmath1 data with previous @xmath55 observations",
    "we have examined the frequency of infrared excess emission among the candidate substellar population .",
    "we derive an infrared fraction of 50 @xmath2 20% for the substellar population from analysis of the @xmath3 colors of both luminosity selected and spectroscopically selected samples of substellar candidates .",
    "this result suggests a significant disk fraction for substellar sources , consistent with earlier results for this and other clusters ( muench et al .",
    "2001 ; liu et al .",
    "the presence of disks around substellar objects provides evidence that the formation mechanism for brown dwarfs and more massive stars is a physically similar process as has been previously argued ( muench et al .",
    "2001 , liu et al . 2003 ) . due to issues of completeness and contamination of the sample by foreground / background stars",
    "we can not determine the true excess / disk fraction for the substellar population and it is therefore not clear whether our measured value of @xmath9 50% for substellar objects is significantly different from the @xmath9 65% fraction found for a complete and representative sample of the stellar members of the cluster from @xmath3 observations",
    ".    our observations also confirm that a number of substellar candidate sources possess unusual colors on the @xmath4 cc diagram .",
    "this is true for both luminosity selected and spectroscopically selected substellar candidates .",
    "these sources exhibit significantly larger infrared @xmath44 excesses than predicted by conventional disk models and thus appear redder for their @xmath36 color .",
    "moreover , a few of these sources exhibit @xmath45 colors that are two blue for their @xmath36 color and do not appear as @xmath45 excess sources on the @xmath3 cc diagram .",
    "the origin of these anomalous colors is unclear .",
    "photometric errors , source variability and perhaps contamination by proplyd emission may all contribute to explain these unusal characteristics .",
    "our deep @xmath1 observations also reveal a significant number of new members of the deeply embedded population of young objects which lies buried in the molecular cloud behind the cluster . as a whole",
    "this embedded population represents the location of the most recent star forming events in the trapezium region .",
    "we find the surface density distribution of the deeply embedded population to follow that of the background molecular ridge and to be highly structured , consisting of a string of at least 5 significant sub - clusters .",
    "if the embedded population represents a continuation of the star formation process responsible for the creation of the more revealed trapezium cluster , then these embedded sub - clusters are likely representative of the primordial building blocks out of which the cluster was and perhaps is still being assembled .",
    "additional evidence for this possibility is found in high resolution map of the surface density distribution of the trapezium cluster itself which shows , in addition to a strong and centrally concentrated peak , significant substructure in the form of small satellite subclusters similar to those in the background cloud .",
    "these findings are generally consistent with the suggestion of scally and clarke ( 2002 ) that the trapezium cluster could have been assembled from the merger a large number of small ( @xmath56 50 stellar members ) subclusters over the past 10@xmath8 years .",
