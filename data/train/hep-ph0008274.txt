    "during recent years cern , desy and fnal have been producing interesting results on diffractive production in hadron and deep - inelastic processes @xcite .",
    "discovery of hard diffraction at cern s@xmath2s and diffractive events in the deep - inelastic scattering at hera were among the most surprising results obtained recently .",
    "significant fraction of high-@xmath0 events among the diffractive events in deep - inelastic scattering and hadron - hadron interactions were also observed at hera and tevatron respectively .",
    "these experimental discoveries renewed interest in the experimental and theoretical studies of the diffractive production processes .",
    "the understanding of the diffractive interactions plays fundamental role in the studies of a high - energy limit of the modern strong interaction theory  qcd .",
    "this field is most interesting one since there are no firmly established computational methods within qcd .",
    "however , the progress in understanding of high  energy basic features and the underlying dynamics of diffraction mechanism can be traced in the recent theoretical papers ( cf .",
    "review @xcite ) .",
    "it is of high importance to have the experimental data at highest possible energy and there is no doubt that soft and hard diffractive processes should be measured at the lhc .",
    "besides elastic scattering ( total and elastic cross - sections ) it is important to measure the inelastic diffractive final states , jet production , hadron transverse momentum distribution , strange and charmed particle productions .",
    "the single diffraction dissociation is a most simple inelastic diffractive process and studies of soft and hard final states in this process could become a next step after elastic measurements .",
    "such measurements are crucial for understanding of the microscopic nature of driving mechanism called pomeron , its possible parton structure , high - energy limit of strong interactions and approaching the asymptotia .    at the currently available energies",
    "there were obtained several sets of the experimental data for single diffraction production process @xmath3 when the hadron @xmath4 is excited to the state @xmath5 with invariant mass @xmath6 and the same quantum numbers .",
    "its subsequent decay results in the multiparticle final state . the inclusive differential cross ",
    "section shows a simple dependence on the invariant mass @xmath6 : @xmath7 meanwhile , energy dependence of the diffractive production cross ",
    "section @xmath8 is not so evident from the experimental data .",
    "the data obtained at fnal seem to demonstrate a growing diffractive cross  section but some data obtained at cern may indicate a falling diffractive cross  section .",
    "resolution of this problem is important in particular for the study of the role of unitarity in the inelastic diffraction and its asymptotical properties .",
    "the angular dependence of the diffractive dissociation is even less clear .",
    "similarity between elastic and inelastic diffraction in the @xmath0-channel approach suggests that the latter one would have similar to elastic scattering behavior of the differential cross - section .",
    "however , it can not be taken for granted and e.g. transverse momentum distribution of diffractive events in the deep - inelastic scattering at hera shows a power - like behavior with no apparent dips @xcite .",
    "similar behavior was observed also in the hadronic diffraction dissociation process at cern @xcite where also no dip and bump structure was observed .",
    "angular dependence of diffraction dissociation together with the measurements of the differential cross  section in elastic scattering would allow to determine the geometrical properties of elastic and inelastic diffraction , their similar and distinctive features and origin .",
    "the experimental regularities of diffractive production can be described in the framework of different approaches , e.g. models for inelastic diffraction based on @xmath9-channel absorptive unitarity were considered in @xcite , optical approach was used in @xcite , dipole pomeron and effective pomeron with energy - dependent intercept were applied in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 dependence is naturally described by the triple ",
    "pomeron diagrams in the framework of regge  model @xcite .",
    "the proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite similarity between the pomeron and photon exchanges allowed to calculate diffractive dissociation cross  section in terms of structure function @xmath11 measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering .",
    "the explanation of @xmath12dependence in the framework of optical model considering diffractive dissociation as a bremsstrahlung where virtual quanta are released from a strong field was made in ref .",
    "explanation of the smallness of a large mass diffraction as a result of the strong non - perturbative interaction of gluons was given in @xcite .",
    "the list of the above references is certainly far from being complete and many theoretical papers devoted to the various aspects of diffractive production were not mentioned .    in ref .",
    "@xcite for the description of single diffractive processes we used geometrical notions on quark scattering in approach based on unitarity for the scattering amplitude and chiral quark model for hadron structure . motivated by the importance of this process for the study of long distance dynamics",
    "we have shown how the energy and @xmath12dependencies can be obtained in the approach to hadron interactions with account for the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and presence of a quark condensate inside a hadron .    in this paper",
    "we consider transverse momentum distribution in the framework of the above approach and show that the diffraction cone would be suppressed and disappears at lhc energy in the production process @xmath13 .",
    "to construct the amplitude of the diffractive production process let us remind that the unitary equation for the scattering amplitude @xmath14 allows one to express the inelastic channel contribution @xmath15 through the @xmath16-matrix @xmath17 and to get respectively the total inelastic cross - section @xmath18 the quantity @xmath19 can be represented in the following form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is an element of @xmath23-particle phase space volume and @xmath24 is the set of kinematical variables related to the @xmath23particle final state .",
    "sum in the right hand side of this equation runs over all inelastic final states which include as well diffractive as non - diffractive ones . to obtain the cross - section of the diffractive dissociation process ( [ bpr ] ) we should single out in this sum the final states corresponding to the process ( [ bpr ] ) .",

    "@xcite we used the notions of effective chiral quark model for the description of elastic scattering and diffractive production .",
    "different aspects of hadron dynamics were accounted in the framework of effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the picture used for the hadron structure implies that overlapping and interaction of peripheral condensates at hadron collision occurs at the first stage . in the overlapping region",
    "the condensates interact and as a result the massive quarks appear .",
    "those quarks are transient ones : they are transformed back into the condensates of the final hadrons in elastic scattering and the diffraction dissociation processes . in elastic scattering",
    "each of the constituent valence quarks located in the central part of the hadron is supposed in the model to scatter in a quasi - independent way by the produced virtual quark pairs at given impact parameter and by the other valence quarks .",
    "for consideration of the diffractive production at the quark level we have extended the picture of hadron interaction in case of elastic scattering @xcite . since the constituent quark is an extended object",
    "there is a non  zero probability of its excitation at the first stage of hadron interaction when peripheral condensates interact .",
    "therefore it seems rather natural to assume that the origin of diffractive production process is an excitation of one of the valence quarks in colliding hadron : @xmath36 , its subsequent scattering and then decay into the final state .",
    "the excited constituent quark is scattered similar to other valence quarks in a quasi - independent way .",
    "the function @xmath28 can be represented then as a product @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass of excited constituent quark .",
    "this mass is taken to be proportional to the mass @xmath6 of excited hadron @xmath5 .",
    "this assumption is based on the additivity of constituent quark masses in the hadron and the absence of the diffractive radiation from the other constituent quarks .    in the model",
    "the @xmath39dependence of the amplitudes @xmath40 and @xmath41 is related to formfactor of the constituent quark and excited constituent quark respectively . the strong interaction radius of constituent quark is determined by its mass .",
    "we suppose that the same is valid for the size of excited quark , i.e. @xmath42 . the expression for @xmath28 can be rewritten then in the following form : @xmath43,\\ ] ] where constant @xmath44 is proportional to the relative probability of excitation of the constituent quark .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is a non - zero one , however , @xmath45 since we expect that the excitation of any constituent quark has lower probability compared to the probability for this quark to stay unexcited .",
    "the excited quark is unstable and its subsequent decay is associated with the decay of hadron @xmath5 into the multiparticle final state @xmath46 .",
    "the expression for @xmath47 is the following @xcite : @xmath48^n \\exp(-\\tilde m b/\\xi ) , \\label{x}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the total number of the constituent quarks in colliding hadrons .",
    "the cross - section of diffractive dissociation process is given by eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) and has the following @xmath9 and @xmath12 dependence @xmath51 thus , we have a familiar @xmath10 dependence of the diffraction cross - section which is related in our model to the geometrical size of excited constituent quark . the energy dependence of single diffractive cross - section has the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the lower limit of the relative momentum of hadron @xmath54 and corresponds to the experimental constraint on diffractive process @xmath55 .",
    "( [ z ] ) shows that the total cross - section of diffractive dissociation has a non - trivial energy dependence which is determined by the contribution of inelastic channels into unitarity equation at zero value of impact parameter .",
    "the dependence of @xmath56 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ xxx ] ) , where @xmath47 is given by eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) .    at @xmath57 , ( @xmath58 is determined by equation @xmath59 ) @xmath60 increases with energy .",
    "this increase as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) and from the experimental data @xcite is rather slow one .",
    "however at @xmath61 , @xmath60 reaches its maximum value @xmath62 and at @xmath63 , the function @xmath60 decreases with energy and at asymptotical energies the inelastic diffraction cross section drops to zero .",
    "but at the lhc energy @xmath64 @xmath65 the single diffractive inelastic cross - sections can reach the value of @xmath66 mb @xcite and therefore might be quite significant .",
    "hence , it worth to consider the structure of the corresponding angular distribution .",
    "the corresponding amplitude @xmath34 can be calculated analytically .",
    "so we continue the amplitudes @xmath67 , to the complex @xmath68plane and transform the fourier ",
    "bessel integral over impact parameter into the integral in the complex @xmath68  plane over the contour @xmath69 which goes around the positive semiaxis .",
    "then for the amplitude @xmath34 the following representation takes place : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the amplitude @xmath72 has the poles in the @xmath68plane determined by equation @xmath73 the solutions of this equation can be written as @xmath74 the amplitude @xmath72 besides the poles has a branching point at @xmath75 .",
    "therefore the amplitude @xmath34 can be represented as a sum of the pole contribution and the contribution of the cut : @xmath76    up to this point the calculation is similar to the case of elastic scattering . for elastic scattering amplitude",
    "@xmath77 the pole and cut contributions are decoupled dynamically when @xmath78 at @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "contribution of the poles determines the elastic amplitude in the region @xmath80 .",
    "the amplitude in this region can be represented in a form of series over the parameter @xmath81 : @xmath82 , \\label{5.14}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 $ ] are the oscillating functions of the variable @xmath84 .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 decreases exponentially with @xmath84 : @xmath86 this series reproduces diffraction peak and familiar dip - bump structure of the differential cross - section in elastic scattering . in the region of moderate @xmath0",
    "it is sufficient to take into account few or even one of the terms of series eq .",
    "the differential cross - section in this region has familiar orear behavior .    however , the situation is different in the case of diffraction production . instead of dynamical separation of the pole and cut contribution discussed above when @xmath87^{-1}),\\ ] ] we have a suppression of the pole contribution at high energies since at fixed @xmath0 @xmath88^{-\\frac { m}{2\\tilde { m}}}\\ln ^{1/2 } g(s)),\\quad f_{diff , c}=o(s[g(s)]^{-\\frac { 1}{2}}),\\ ] ] i.e. the pole contribution is suppressed at high energies where @xmath89 since @xmath90 . therefore , at all @xmath0 values we will have @xmath91 where @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "this means that the differential cross - section of the diffraction production will have smooth dependence on @xmath0 with no apparent dips and bumps @xmath94 it is interesting to note that at large values of @xmath95 the normalized differential cross - section @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is the value of cross - section at @xmath98 ) will exhibit scaling behavior @xmath99 and explicit form of the function @xmath100 is the following @xmath101 the numerical parameter @xmath102 in the model is about 2 .",
    "the function eq .",
    "( [ scal ] ) against the variable @xmath1 is depicted in the fig . 1 .",
    "= 80 mm    the above scaling has been obtained in the model approach , however it might have a more general meaning .",
    "the angular structure of diffraction dissociation processes given by eq .",
    "( [ dsig ] ) takes place at high energies where @xmath89 while at moderate energies where @xmath103 the both contributions from poles and cut are significant . at low energies where @xmath104 the situation is similar to the elastic scattering , i.e. there diffraction cone and possible dip - bump structure",
    "should be present in the region of small values of @xmath0 . in this region @xmath105 , \\label{poldif}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath106 is the same as in the elastic case and @xmath107^{-\\frac { m}{2\\tilde { m}}}\\ln ^{1/2 } g(s)).\\ ] ]",
    "we considered behavior of the differential cross - section for single inelastic diffraction . at low and moderate energies behavior of the differential cross - section",
    "will be rather complicated and incorporate diffraction cone , orear type and power - like dependencies .    however , at high energies a simple power - like dependence on @xmath0 is predicted .",
    "it was shown that the normalized differential cross - section has a scaling form and only depends on the ratio @xmath1 at large values of @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , our particular comparative analysis of the poles and cut contributions has very little with the model form of the @xmath16matrix .",
    "the approach is based on the combination of unitarity with the diffraction production mechanism via excitation and subsequent decay of a constituent quark .",
    "this is why it may have a more general meaning .    at the lhc energy the diffractive events with the masses as large as 3 tev",
    "could be studied",
    ". it would be interesting to check this prediction at the lhc where the scaling and simple power - like behavior of diffraction dissociation differential cross - section should be observed .",
    "observation of such behavior would confirm the diffraction mechanism based on excitation of the complex hadronlike colorless object - constituent quark .",
    "this mechanism can in principle explain angular structure of diffraction in the deep - inelastic scattering at hera where smooth angular dependence on the thrust transverse momentum was observed @xcite .",
    "if it is the case , then diffraction in dis at lower energies should manifest typical soft diffractive behavior with exponential peak at small @xmath0 as it does in hadronic reactions . it would be interesting to check it at lower energies , e. g. at jefferson lab .",
    "there could be envisaged various experimental configurations at the lhc ; e.g. soft diffraction goes well to the interest of the totem experiment , while hard diffractive final states can be measured by cms detector and possible correlations between the features of the soft and hard diffractive processes can be obtained using combined measurements of totem and cms @xcite .",
    "measurements of the angular dependence of diffraction dissociation simultaneously with the measurements of the differential cross  section of elastic scattering are important for the determination of the global geometrical properties of elastic and inelastic diffraction , their similar and distinctive features and the origin and nature of the driving asymptotic mechanism . in general",
    "these studies could be an essential tool to probe non - perturbative qcd .",
