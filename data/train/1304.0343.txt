    "supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy guts ) @xcite are promising candidates of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "indeed , they are strongly motivated by an experimental observation which implies that the gauge coupling constants of the sm gauge groups are to be unified at a certain high - energy scale with good accuracy @xcite . from the observation ,",
    "the unified scale is estimated as @xmath7  gev . in the guts ,",
    "new superheavy particles are supposed to appear around the scale , which make the couplings run together above the scale .",
    "these particles are naturally expected to have masses of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "they are , of course , beyond the reach of collider experiments , and there is little hope to search for them or to measure their masses directly .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , a way of constraining the masses of superheavy particles indirectly by requiring the gauge coupling unification is discussed and limits on the masses are presented . later , by applying the same method with more accurate gauge coupling constants , the authors in ref .  @xcite derive a more stringent constraint on the masses of the color - triplet higgs boson , the adjoint higgs bosons , and the @xmath1 bosons in the context of the minimal susy su(5 ) gut @xcite .",
    "they have found that while the masses of the adjoint higgs and the @xmath1 bosons are around @xmath0  gev , the mass of the color - triplet higgs boson lies in the region of @xmath9  gev , which is significantly below the gut scale .",
    "this implies that the threshold corrections to the gauge coupling constants are still not small , even in the susy guts .",
    "in fact , the analysis is quite sensitive to the mass spectrum in the intermediate scale , such as those of the susy particles . in ref .",
    "@xcite , all of the particles except for gauginos are assumed to be at 1  tev .",
    "the gaugino masses are set to be around the electroweak scale with the gut relation for the gaugino masses being assumed .",
    "currently , on the other hand , the susy models with heavy sfermions have been widely discussed with a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "although such models originally have been discussed as a possible candidate of susy models from a theoretical point of view , now they are also supported by the latest results of the lhc experiments ; no significant excess in the susy searches @xcite and the discovery of the 126  gev higgs boson @xcite both suggest that the susy breaking scale is somewhat higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "while this high - scale susy scenario is difficult to be probed at the collider experiments , it still has a lot of phenomenological consequences which might be checked in other experiments .",
    "recent studies on the subject are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the gut scale mass spectrum inferred from the indirect analysis presented in refs .",
    "@xcite is highly dependent on the susy mass spectrum .",
    "in particular , if the susy particles have masses much larger than @xmath10  tev , previous results are expected to be changed significantly . in this letter , therefore , we revisit the analysis in the high - scale susy scenario .",
    "we carry out the calculation in the minimal susy su(5 ) gut with sfermions having masses well above the electroweak scale .",
    "we will see that while the constraint on the adjoint higgs and @xmath1 boson masses only differs from previous ones slightly , that on the color - triplet higgs mass is found to be changed by more than an order of magnitude and actually improved in the sense that it may also be around the gut scale .",
    "interestingly enough , this result again indicates that the high - scale susy scenario is rather supported than the traditional low - energy susy models .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] , the high - scale susy model which we discuss below is presented , and its phenomenological aspects are briefly described .",
    "the mass spectrum of the superheavy particles in the minimal susy su(5 ) gut is also displayed there . in the subsequent section ,",
    "we discuss the method of constraining the masses of the gut - scale multiplets by means of the renormalization group equations ( rges ) as well as the threshold corrections of the gauge couplings .",
    "then , we show some results in sec",
    ".  [ results ] .",
    "section .",
    "[ conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "let us begin by presenting a high - scale susy model discussed in this letter .",
    "we consider the particle content of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "then , the only assumption which we adopt here is that there exists a dynamical susy - breaking sector with the khler potential having a generic structure .",
    "then , all of the scalar bosons except the lightest higgs boson acquire masses of the order of the gravitino mass @xmath11 , while the lightest higgs boson mass is fine - tuned to be @xmath12  gev .",
    "the higgsinos may in general have similar masses to the gravitino mass , though they might be suppressed if there are some extra chiral symmetries .",
    "the gaugino masses are , on the other hand , generated by the quantum effects @xcite and , thus , suppressed by a loop factor compared with @xmath11 .",
    "there are two kinds of contributions to the gaugino masses ; one is the anomaly mediation effect @xcite and the other is from the higgsino - higgs boson loop diagram .",
    "these two effects give rise to the gaugino masses as @xmath13 with @xmath14 representing the higgsino - higgs boson loop contribution .",
    "here , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 and 3 ) are the u(1)@xmath18 , su(2)@xmath19 , and su(3)@xmath20 gaugino masses and gauge coupling constants , respectively .",
    "we use the su(5 ) normalization for the u(1)@xmath18 coupling , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath21 .",
    "further , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the higgsino and the heavy higgs boson masses , respectively , which are assumed to be the same order of magnitude as sfermion masses .",
    "@xmath24 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the higgs fields ; @xmath25 . since the higgsino mass is presumed to be around the gravitino mass , the higgsino - loop contribution @xmath26 is also expected to be as large as @xmath11 .",
    "the values of the gaugino masses are , however , dependent on the relative phase between @xmath22 and @xmath11 . in the following discussion",
    "we just assume the gaugino masses are lighter than the scalar masses by a loop factor , and regard them as free parameters .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , this model has a lot of fascinating features from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "they are originally discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and recent development is given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these works , a typical scale for sfermion masses is taken to be @xmath27@xmath28 )  tev , which explains the 126  gev higgs boson mass . with such heavy particles the susy flavor and cp problems @xcite as well as the gravitino problem are considerably relaxed . in this case ,",
    "the gaugino masses are @xmath29(1 ) tev because of an one - loop factor .",
    "note that from eq .",
    "it is found that with a moderate value of @xmath26 , wino becomes the lightest among gauginos , and thus the lightest susy particle in this model .",
    "it is quite interesting since the wino dark matter with a mass of @xmath303  tev is consistent with cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "the dark matter might be searched directly @xcite or indirectly @xcite in future dark matter experiments .",
    "moreover , the gauge coupling unification in this high - scale susy model is found to be achieved as precisely as that in the mssm .",
    "thus the susy gut is still promising in the case of high - scale supersymmetry . in the next section ,",
    "we in turn require the gauge coupling unification and constrain the gut scale mass spectrum by using the requirement .",
    "now , we briefly summarize the superheavy particles in the minimal susy su(5 ) gut , which we adopt as the working hypothesis in this paper .",
    "the susy su(5 ) gauge theory includes twenty - four gauge superfields @xmath31 with @xmath32 . by using the su(5 )",
    "generators @xmath33 we define a @xmath34 matrix representation of the vector superfields such that @xmath35 , with the components written as @xmath36 we collectively call @xmath37 and @xmath38 the @xmath1-bosons hereafter .",
    "the unified gauge group su(5 ) is spontaneously broken by the vev of the adjoint higgs boson @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) to su(3)@xmath41su(2)@xmath42u(1)@xmath18 . again , we define @xmath43 and its components by @xmath44 the mssm higgs superfields are , on the other hand , incorporated into fundamental and anti - fundamental representations as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the mssm higgs superfields . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are called the color - triplet higgs multiplets .",
    "the superpotential of the higgs sector in the minimal su(5 ) susy gut is given by @xmath49 after the adjoint higgs field gets the vev , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , the su(5 ) gauge group is broken to the sm su(3)@xmath41su(2)@xmath42u(1)@xmath18 gauge groups without breaking the supersymmetry .",
    "also the parameter @xmath52 is fine - tuned as @xmath53 in order to realize the doublet - triplet mass splitting in @xmath54 and @xmath55 . with the condition ,",
    "the mass of the color - triplet higgs boson is @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath1-boson mass is @xmath57 with @xmath58 the unified gauge coupling constant .",
    "as regards the adjoint higgs multiplets , the components @xmath59 and @xmath60 have masses of @xmath61 and @xmath62 has @xmath63 .",
    "the components @xmath64 and @xmath65 become the longitudinal component of the @xmath1-bosons , and thus do not show up as physical states .",
    "in this section , we present the rges of the gauge and yukawa coupling constants , as well as the boundary conditions at each threshold .",

    "in this letter , we have presented constraints on the masses of the gut scale particles from the gauge coupling unification in the case of the high - scale susy scenario . to that end , we have used the two - loop rges for the gauge couplings with one - loop threshold corrections considered . as a result ,",
    "the mass of the color - triplet higgs multiplets @xmath81 turns out to be considerably large compared with previous results in the traditional low - energy susy scenario , while the gut scale is found to be slightly lower .",

    "interestingly , all of the superheavy particles might be around @xmath0  gev in the high - scale susy models .",
    "the mass spectrum of the gut scale particles predicted here stimulates us to reconsider the proton decay in the case of high - scale supersymmetry . as mentioned to above",
    ", the relatively low gut scale enhances the proton decay rate via the @xmath1-boson exchanging process .",
    "if the enhancement is strong enough , the proton decay in the @xmath115 channel might be searched in future experiments .",
    "furthermore , the experiments may also reach the proton decay through the color - triplet higgs exchange . since the decay process predicts too short lifetime @xcite ,",
    "some suppression mechanism for the process has been assumed .",
    "nevertheless , with @xmath81 larger than those considered in the previous literature and sfermions much heavier than the electroweak scale , this process might evade the current experimental bound without any mechanism of limiting the color - triplet higgs exchanging process .",
    "in such a case , it is possible for the @xmath116 mode , which is the main decay mode in the case of the color - triplet higgs exchange , to be searched in near future .",
    "a detailed analysis of this decay process will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note that , in proposed models where the color - triplet higgs exchange is suppressed by some mechanism , large threshold corrections to the gauge coupling constants at the gut scale tend to appear .",
    "one of the examples is introduction of the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite .",
    "it was found that when the threshold corrections at the gut scale are small , the suppression mechanism does not work @xcite . in the susy su(5 ) guts in higher dimensional space the u(1)@xmath117 symmetry",
    "forbids the dimension - five proton decay , though the kaluza - klein particles generate large threshold corrections to the gauge coupling constants @xcite .",
