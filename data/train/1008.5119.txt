    "the majority of detected high - energy ( gev  tev ) charged primary cosmic rays ( crs ) is believed to be produced in our galaxy , most likely in supernova remnants ( snrs ) . during the transport from their source of origin to our solar system , crs scatter on random and irregular components of the @xmath6 g galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) , which almost isotropize the crs direction distribution .",
    "this happens because the larmor radius for a typical value of 4@xmath6 g for the gmf and for a 100  gev singly - charged particle is @xmath7  pc , considerably smaller than the typical distance to a nearby source ( of the order of a hundred pc ) .",
    "nevertheless , several ground experiments across a wide range of energies have still detected anisotropies of medium ( @xmath8 ) to large ( @xmath9 ) angular scales ( for instance see @xcite ) .",
    "searches for such anisotropies can provide unique information on the sources of crs and the environment in which they have propagated .",
    "contrary to hadronic crs , high - energy ( @xmath10gev ) cosmic ray electrons and positrons ( cres ) propagating in the gmf lose their energy rapidly through synchrotron radiation and by inverse compton collisions with low - energy photons of the interstellar radiation field .",
    "cres observed with energies 100  gev ( 1  tev ) originated from relatively nearby locations , less than about 1.6  kpc ( 0.75  kpc ) away @xcite .",
    "this means that it could be possible that such high - energy cres originate from a highly anisotropic collection of a few nearby sources ( possibly pulsars and snrs ) .",
    "therefore , depending on the propagation properties in the gmf , the detection of excess cres with energies high enough to minimize both the geomagnetic field and any heliospheric effects might reveal the presence of such nearby cre sources .",
    "similarly , assuming a reasonable distribution of nearby cre sources , measurements of the cre anisotropy can be used to constrain the diffusion of cres in the galaxy .",
    "finally , further anisotropy that is not associated with nearby cr sources is expected to result from the compton - getting ( cg ) effect @xcite , in which the relative motion of the observer with respect to the cr plasma changes the intensity of the cr fluxes , with larger intensity arriving from the direction of motion and lower intensity arriving from the opposite direction .",
    "the dataset of the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ satellite @xcite provides a unique high statistics sample for cre anisotropy studies . in this paper , we report the results of a search for anisotropies in the reconstructed directions of the events in this dataset .",
    "the lat is a pair - conversion gamma - ray telescope designed to measure gamma rays in the energy range from 20  mev to more than 300  gev . in this paper a brief description of the lat",
    "is given , while full details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the lat is composed of a @xmath11 array of 16 identical towers designed to convert incident gamma - rays into @xmath12 pairs , and to determine their arrival directions and energies .",
    "each tower hosts a tracker module and a calorimeter module .",
    "each tracker module consists of 18 x - y planes of silicon - strip detectors , interleaved with tungsten converter foils , for a total on - axis thickness equivalent to 1.5 radiation lengths ( r.l . ) .",
    "each calorimeter module , 8.6 r.l . on - axis",
    "thick , hosts 96 csi(tl ) crystals , hodoscopically arranged in 8 perpendicular layers .",
    "the instrument is surrounded by a segmented anti - coincidence detector that tags the majority of the charged - particle background .",
    "although the lat was designed for detecting photons , it was recognized that it can also work as an excellent detector of high - energy cres .",
    "the calorimeter behaves in the same way for electrons and gamma rays , and helps with discriminating electromagnetic from hadronic showers .",
    "the early part of the shower can be reconstructed in detail in the tracker , contributing to the hadron / electron separation .",
    "the analyzed dataset corresponds to the first year of lat science operation and starts on august 2008 . because the earth s magnetic field can affect the directions of incoming cre events , introducing or hiding anisotropies ,",
    "we have selected events with an energy high enough ( e@xmath1060  gev ) to minimize the geomagnetic field s influence yielding @xmath13  million events .",
    "while this 60  gev energy threshold is significantly higher than the geomagnetic cut - off in any part of _ fermi s _ orbit , the geomagnetic field could still introduce some deflections even above this energy , possibly giving rise to a spillover effect in adjacent regions of the sky .",
    "furthermore , the heliospheric magnetic field ( hmf ) can also affect the directions of particles propagating in it , exhibiting an appreciable effect on cres with energies @xmath14  gev , which diminishes quickly with rising energy , until it becomes negligible at energies over several hundred gev .",
    "however , it is not easy to quantify the hmf s influence on cres of some energy propagating in it , since this would require a good knowledge of the hmf s structure and of the propagation of cres through it . because of the absence of a well defined energy threshold over which the hmf effects can be ignored , we decided to start the analysis from 60  gev with the caveat that some of our lower - energy results might be affected by the hmf .    to minimize the contamination from the earth s albedo",
    ", events with reconstructed directions near the earth s limb or detected during the interval when the earth s limb enters the lat s field of view more than usual ( when the rocking angle is greater than @xmath15 ) were rejected .",
    "this cut removed roughly @xmath16 of the events , leaving a total of @xmath17 million events for this analysis .",
    "it should be noted that all the events in the dataset were detected while the _ fermi _ spacecraft was outside the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "the _ fermi _ satellite is usually operated in `` sky - survey mode '' . in this operation mode , the sky is fully observed every 2  orbits ( @xmath23 hours ) .",
    "this ensures a uniform ( up to @xmath18 ) all - sky exposure and allows us to search for anisotropies of any angular scale ( including dipole anisotropy ) and from any direction in the sky .",
    "the angular resolution of the lat for e@xmath1060  gev electron events is about @xmath19 or better and the energy resolution ( 1@xmath20 ) is @xmath5 .",
    "the contamination of the analyzed dataset with other species , such as photons or protons , can result in some systematic uncertainties .",
    "the fraction of hadron events in the dataset ranges from @xmath21 at 20  gev to @xmath22 at 1  tev , while the photon contamination is negligible ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the full details of _ fermi s _ cre data analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the whole sky was searched for anisotropies in galactic coordinates with no a priori assumptions on the direction , the angular scale , or the energy spectrum of a potential signal .",
    "the dataset was analyzed in its entirety , without trying to divide it in time to perform a search optimized for detecting transient anisotropies .",
    "one way to search for anisotropies is to first calculate the flux of cre particles from each direction in the sky ( equal to the ratio of the number of detected events from some direction over the exposure towards the same direction ) , and then examine its directional distribution .",
    "the flux calculation , which requires knowledge of the exposure , depends on the effective area of the detector and the accumulated observation livetime .",
    "the effective area , calculated from a monte carlo simulation of the instrument , could suffer from systematic errors , such as a dependence on the time or on the location of the spacecraft , or any miscalculations of the dependence of the effective area on the instrument coordinates ( off - axis and azimuthal angle ) .",
    "naturally , any systematic errors involved in the calculation of the exposure will propagate to the flux , possibly affecting its directional distribution . if the magnitude of these systematic errors is comparable to or larger than the statistical power of the available dataset , their effects on the flux s directional distribution might masquerade as a real detectable anisotropy . as will be shown below",
    ", the statistics of the available dataset allow us to search for anisotropies as small as a fraction of a percent . because the effective area of the detector is not known to a better accuracy",
    ", it follows that it is not safe to perform anisotropy searches of such sensitivity by examining the directional distribution of the particle flux .",
    "for that reason , we employed two alternative methods that are free of systematic errors larger than a fraction of a percent .",
    "the starting point of this analysis is the construction of a sky map that shows how the sky as seen by the _",
    "fermi_-lat would look on average if the cre direction distribution were perfectly isotropic .",
    "this sky map , hereafter called `` no - anisotropy sky map '' , represents the null hypothesis for the existence of an anisotropy . a comparison of the no - anisotropy sky map to a sky map generated by the actually detected cre events ( the `` actual '' or `` signal '' sky map ) was used to reveal the presence of any anisotropies in the data .    as a cross - check of the systematic errors involved in this analysis ,",
    "two techniques were used to build the no - anisotropy sky map , producing similar results .",
    "the two techniques are described below .    * * shuffling technique * : + one way of generating the no - anisotropy map is to randomize the reconstructed directions of the detected events @xcite . in case the direction distribution of the cr flux is perfectly isotropic , a time - independent intensity should be detected when looking at any given detector direction .",
    "possible time variation of the intensity would be due only to changes in the operating conditions of the instrument .",
    "a set of isotropic simulated events can be built by randomly coupling the times and the directions of real events in local instrument coordinates .",
    "the randomization is performed starting with the position of a given event in the lat frame and exchanging it with the direction of another event , which was selected randomly from the data set with a uniform probability . starting with this information ,",
    "the sky direction is re - evaluated for the simulated event . in this way",
    "the random coupling preserves the exposure and the total number of events .",
    "this process is repeated multiple times ( 100 ) , with each time producing a sky map that is compatible with an isotropic cre direction distribution .",
    "the final no - anisotropy sky map is produced by taking the average of these sky maps . by this construction ,",
    "the simulated data set preserves exactly the energy and angular ( with respect to the lat reference frame ) distributions , and also accounts for the detector dead times . to minimize the possible effects of a varying cre event rate ,",
    "the data set is first split into 10 segments with equal number of events , and the technique is applied to each of these sets separately .",
    "* * direct - integration technique * : + this technique is based on @xcite . in general , the rate of events detected in some narrow solid angle around a given direction (",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 ) @xcite at some time @xmath26 is equal to the all - sky rate at that time @xmath27 times the probability @xmath28 of an event being reconstructed inside that same solid angle .",
    "given a dataset and the lat s pointing information , we can calculate the values of the two functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , given the values of these two functions and the lat s pointing information for some observation we can predict how the sky would look for that same observation ( i.e. construct a sky map ) . the main idea of",
    "this method is to first extract from the cre dataset the set of values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 that corresponds to an isotropic cre distribution , and then construct the associated no - cre - anisotropy sky map .",
    "the presence of any anisotropies in the data would create transient fluctuations in the instantaneous values of these functions , as these anisotropies passed through the lat s field of view . however",
    ", these anisotropies would have no effect on the longer - term average values of these functions , since any transient fluctuations would be averaged out . in this application",
    ", we used a constant - over - time @xmath29 produced after averaging @xmath28 over the whole dataset .",
    "for an isotropic sky , the only time dependence of @xmath28 would come only from temporal variations of the dependence of the detector s effective area on @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we did not detect any such variations in the data , therefore using an average over the whole dataset @xmath29 was valid .",
    "similarly , any temporal variations of the effective area of the detector would create fluctuations of the instantaneous value and the longer - term averages of @xmath27 , depending on the time scales of the effective - area variations . unlike @xmath28 , which remained sufficiently constant for this purpose ,",
    "the all - sky rate exhibited fluctuations on multiple time scales caused by varying background rates occurring as the spacecraft was moving through regions of different geomagnetic coordinates and by changes in the instrument s hardware settings .",
    "any such instrumental effects affecting the all - sky rate were parametrized , and given an averaged - over - multiple - orbits value of the all - sky rate @xcite , the all - sky rate at some shorter - duration segment could be accurately predicted .",
    "these parametrizations are necessary because the direct - integration method constructs the no - anisotropy - skymap incrementally , adding the results from observations of short enough duration that the lat s pointing can be assumed quasi - constant ( e.g. , 30  s long ) . as a cross - check ,",
    "this technique was also applied with @xmath27 being given by the instantaneous rate of actually detected cre events , instead of an averaged value .",
    "this choice has the benefit of automatically taking care of any temporal variations of the effective area , avoiding the need to apply any corrections and , most importantly , avoiding any systematic errors introduced by such corrections .",
    "it should be noted however that not performing an averaging in the all - sky rate weakens the power of this method to smear out the presence of any anisotropies in the data , with the result of any stronger anisotropies possibly leaking in the no - cre - anisotropy sky map .",
    "nevertheless , for this application , the results of the direct - integration technique when using the instantaneous event rate and when using the averaged - over - multiple orbits event rate plus the necessary corrections were consistent with each other .    for our sky maps , we adopted the healpix @xcite pixelization scheme to ensure that all pixels across the sky have the same area ( or solid angle ) .",
    "the resolution of the healpix grid is expressed by the parameter @xmath30 , which defines the total number of pixels : @xmath31 .",
    "our maps had @xmath32 , which corresponds to 12,288 @xmath33deg@xmath34 pixels .",
    "the sky maps presented in this paper are all in galactic coordinates .",
    "the no - anisotropy maps were compared to the actual sky map using two independent methods , described below .",
    "the first method is a simple direct bin - to - bin comparison of the two maps , in which a search for statistically significant deviations between the number of actually detected and the number of expected events under the assumption of isotropy is performed .",
    "one way to search for anisotropies of some angular scale , is to use sky maps composed of _ independent _ bins with bin size similar to the angular scale of the anisotropy under search .",
    "however , when using independent bins , a potential anisotropic signal might become too weak to be detected since it will probably be distributed among multiple adjacent bins .",
    "a more sensitive way to perform the search , adopted in the present analysis , is to use sky maps consisting of a large number of _ correlated _ bins .",
    "the content of a correlated bin is equal to the integrated number of events in a circular region around that bin .",
    "using such `` integrated sky maps '' , it is very likely that there will be at least one bin with its center roughly aligned with the direction of the center of a potential anisotropy , reducing spillover effects and increasing sensitivity .",
    "in general , the sensitivity for detecting an anisotropy of given angular scale is greater when an integration radius close to that scale is chosen .",
    "if the integration radius is too small or too large compared to the angular scale of the prospective anisotropy , the sensitivity becomes sub - optimal since either the signal can be split among several adjacent bins or there can be too much `` background '' ( isotropic signal ) contamination . in this work , to search for anisotropies of various angular scales we compared multiple pairs of integrated no - anisotropy and actual sky maps , with each pair corresponding to a different integration radius .",
    "the integration radii were chosen to cover the range of anisotropy angular - scales under consideration and ranged from @xmath35 to @xmath9 .",
    "the comparison was performed by calculating the statistical significance of the difference between the contents of the integrated actual and the no - anisotropy sky maps . to take into account the statistical errors involved in construction of the no - anisotropy sky maps by the event - shuffling technique ,",
    "the significances for that method were evaluated using the prescription in  @xcite , by using the likelihood method @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the results of the event - shuffling technique were stable even after a couple tens of repetitions .",
    "for this application , we used 100 repetitions , rendering the associated statistical errors negligible .",
    "for the case of the direct - integration technique , since its produced no - anisotropy sky map is the result of a direct calculation , there were no associated statistical errors and the significance was calculated using simple poisson probabilities .    )",
    "involved in evaluating the contents of a single significance map . from top",

    "the horizontal dashed line shows the number of bins in these maps ( 12,288 ) .",
    "as expected , the number of effective trials for an independent - bins sky map ( top curve ) is equal to the number of bins in the map ( horizontal line ) .",
    "the effective numbers of trials for integrated maps are in general smaller than the number of bins , with the integration radius being inversely correlated to the number of effective trials .",
    "the error bars show the statistical error that arises from the finite number of simulated sky maps . ]    as was mentioned above , this is a search for anisotropies from any direction in the whole sky . as such",
    ", it involves a large number of trials ( independent tests ) , that have to be accounted for when judging the statistical significance of its results . for a whole - sky search",
    "performed using independent - bin sky maps , the number of trials is equal to the number of pixels in the sky map . on the other hand ,",
    "searches that use correlated - bin sky maps , such as this one , involve a number of _ effective trials _ that is in general smaller than the number of bins in one such sky map .",
    "the larger the integration radius , the higher the degree of correlation between adjacent bins and the smaller the number of effective trials per evaluated bin .",
    "the number of effective trials involved in evaluating the contents of an integrated map was evaluated using a monte carlo simulation .",
    "fake significance maps were built corresponding to various integration radii and to a perfectly isotropic signal . by counting the fraction of such sky maps",

    "initially , the fluctuations sky map is expanded in the basis of spherical harmonics , producing a set of coefficients @xmath40 .",

    "the positron excess detected by pamela can be ascribed not only to astrophysical sources such as pulsars , but also to the annihilation or decay of galactic dark matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , as pointed out in the early analyses ( see for example @xcite ) , any anisotropy in the arrival directions of cres detected by the lat is a powerful tool to discriminate between a dark matter origin and an astrophysical one .",
    "in particular , since galactic dark matter is denser towards the direction of the galactic center , the generic expectation in the dark matter annihilation or decay scenario is a dipole with an excess towards the center of the galaxy and a deficit towards the anti - center .",
    "luckily , as pointed out in @xcite , both the monogem and the geminga pulsars , likely some of the most significant cre pulsar sources , even after the discovery of several radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars by the lat @xcite , are both roughly placed opposite to the direction of the galactic center , making a search for anisotropy an effective distinguishing diagnostic .",
    "the expected level of dipole anisotropy produced by dark matter annihilating in the milky way halo , calculated by tuning the annihilation rate to match the positron fraction measured by the pamela satellite , is comparable or more likely smaller than the degree of anisotropy expected by astrophysical galactic sources as modeled in galprop ( see the solid line in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : predictions ] ) .",
    "we verified this with an explicit calculation with galprop , slightly modified to include the injection of cres from dm annihilation while using the same propagation setup employed to derive the anisotropy from nearby pulsars .",
    "the galprop results from the conventional astrophysical galactic sources and from a scenario with dm distributed according to a navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) profile , with a 3  tev mass candidate that annihilates into @xmath136 with a cross section of @xmath137 @xmath138 s@xmath119 , a local dm density of 0.43  gev  @xmath139 and a 20  kpc of core radius have been added . with this dm model , the measured overall cre flux by the lat and the charge ratio measured by pamela",

    "[ fig : predictions ] ) .",
    "a caveat however exists to the statement above , due to the possibility that most of the high - energy positrons detected by pamela are produced by dark matter annihilations in a nearby dark matter clump .",
    "the halo of the milky way , in the context of the cold dark matter paradigm , is in fact thought to host a myriad of hierarchical smaller sub - halos and sub - sub - halos , potentially contributing significantly to the dark matter annihilation signal , as envisioned in @xcite . in the analysis of @xcite",
    ", it was shown that ( a ) compared to n - body simulation results @xcite , the likelihood of a nearby and luminous clump that could explain the pamela excess is very remote ( to the level of less than 0.01% ) for ordinary pair - annihilation cross - sections , and ( b ) when assuming large annihilation cross - sections , the predicted associated gamma - ray flux from dark matter annihilation would in most cases exceed the point - source sensitivity of the lat .",
    "in other words and for the second point , if a clump is responsible for most of the locally measured positrons , it would have very likely already been observed it shining in gamma rays .     versus the minimum energy for some dm scenarios .",

    "figure  [ fig : regis ] shows the anisotropy induced by such a point source departing at 1.54 kpc ( approaching at 1.43 kpc ) as a dashed ( dotted ) line .",
    "the anisotropy is typically mainly sensitive to the dark matter clumps distance , but the different anisotropies for these two clumps ( at almost the same distance ) are mainly due to an approaching compared to a departing clump .",

    "it should be noted that the dark - matter - induced anisotropies predicted here are only valid within their given set - up ; additional significant cre - source contributions , a different astrophysical background , or a modified diffusion model , would modify the expected dipole - anisotropy signal .",
    "we conclude that , even in optimistic scenarios of a bright and reasonable local dark matter clump , the anisotropy signal is expected to be below the experimental limits reported here .",
    "the cg effect predicts a dipole amplitude of @xmath151 for crs with a power law spectrum @xmath152 , and for an observer ( earth ) moving with speed @xmath153 with respect to the local cr plasma . two relative motions  the motion of the sun with respect to the cr plasma , and the motion of the earth with respect to the sun  can create anisotropies through the cg effect .",
    "previous studies of cr anisotropies failed to detect a cg effect due to the motion of the sun , showing that the cr plasma co - rotates with the local stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this study we only expect to detect a cg effect due to the motion of the earth around the sun .",
    "the expected amplitude of this effect ( for an orbital speed of v=29.8  km  s@xmath119 ) is @xmath154 , considerably smaller than the sensitivity of this search",
    ". a dedicated analysis fully investigating the cg effect as function of both solar and sidereal time may be more sensitive in detecting it .",
    "contamination of the cre sample with other species ( protons ) can introduce some systematic uncertainties in the measurement .",
    "ground experiments have detected anisotropies for protons of energies above 10  tev at the @xmath155 level .",
    "since these fluctuations are expected to increase with energy at a rate of about @xmath156 @xcite , they are expected at a level of @xmath157 for the current observed energy band .",
    "we should expect fluctuations of the order of @xmath158 or less due to proton contamination in our cre selection , less than the sensitivity of this search .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the results presented here are valid to the degree that the hmf did not smear away any actual galactic anisotropies .",
    "it could be the case that the detected isotropy is the result of smearing by the hmf , instead of a truly isotropic galactic cre distribution .",
    "more than 1.6 @xmath0 @xmath1 primary cosmic - ray electrons / positrons with energies above 60  gev have been observed by the lat instrument during its first year of operation .",
    "an all - sky study without any a priori assumptions on the energy , direction , and angular size has been performed to search for possible anisotropies in the incoming directions of these events .",
    "the search was performed using two independent and complementary techniques , both providing a null result .",
    "the upper limits on a fractional anisotropic excess ranged from a fraction of a percent to roughly one , for the range of minimum energies and angular scales considered . a detailed study of the dipole anisotropy has been also performed , and upper limits ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath159 , depending on the energy , have been set .",
    "our upper limits on the dipole anisotropy were compared with the predicted anisotropies from individual nearby pulsars and from dark matter annihilations . in all cases ,",
    "our upper limits lie roughly above the predicted anisotropies .",
