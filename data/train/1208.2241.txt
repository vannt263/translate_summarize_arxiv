    "summing over all edges , we get @xmath110 . in order for this to be a strict inequality ,",

    "hence , @xmath115 would be the same as @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath6 has distinct endpoints , then it is clear that on @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath14 differ by an orientation preserving homeomorphism . if @xmath6 is a loop , then perhaps @xmath9 and @xmath14 map @xmath6 to the same geodesic , but with opposite orientation .",
    "since @xmath9 and @xmath14 are homotopic ( via a homotopy that does not move the vertices ) , that would imply that the loop @xmath115 is homotopic to its inverse . since @xmath4 is torsion - free and simple loops in @xmath1 map to non - nullhomotopic loops in @xmath0 , this can not happen .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 and @xmath14 must be essentially equivalent , which is a contradiction .",
    "note that if @xmath114 is not a single point , it is a geodesic path .",
    "pick an edge @xmath6 with ( not necessarily distinct ) endpoints @xmath96 and @xmath99 , such that @xmath114 is not a single point .",
    "if the inequality  ( [ edge_ineq ] ) for @xmath6 is strict , then we are done .",
    "if it is an equality , then the angles @xmath28 and @xmath38 must each be either 0 or @xmath70 .",
    "this implies that the angle between @xmath114 and @xmath115 is either 0 or @xmath70 .",
    "the vertex @xmath96 must have some other edge @xmath117 adjacent to it . in  @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the angle between any two edges sharing a vertex in a minimal length carrier graph is @xmath118 .",
    "in particular , the angle between @xmath119 and @xmath115 is @xmath118 .",
    "thus , the angle between @xmath119 and @xmath114 can not be 0 or @xmath70 , and so for @xmath120 , the inequality  ( [ edge_ineq ] ) must be strict .",
    "hence , we get the desired contradiction @xmath121    in the examples following proposition  [ nonunique ] , we found that minimal length carrier graphs were not unique because we can compose them with ambient isometries to get new carrier graphs .",
    "it is perhaps natural to wonder if any two minimal length carrier graphs are related in this way ( up to reparamaterizing their edges ) . if this were true , then the well - known fact that for a large class of hyperbolic 3-manifolds @xmath0",
    ", @xmath20 is finite , would imply theorem  [ finite ] , that there are only finitely many minimal length carrier graphs .",
    "we will prove this theorem directly using theorem  [ main_thm ] via the following proposition and then prove the finiteness of isometry groups as a corollary in the next section .",
    "[ prop ] let @xmath0 be a finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold and let @xmath122 .",
    "there are only finitely many carrier graphs which are minimal length within their equivalence class and have length less than or equal to @xmath123 .",
    "suppose @xmath0 has an infinite sequence of carrier graphs @xmath124 , each of minimal length within its equivalence class and each with length less than or equal to @xmath123 .",
    "being minimal length implies the graphs are trivalent .",
    "there are only finitely many trivalent graphs of a particular rank ; so we may pass to a subsequence and assume that every @xmath125 is homeomorphic to a particular graph @xmath1 . we will continue to call this sequence @xmath126 . since the @xmath126 have bounded length and a carrier graph can not be contained in a cusp ( because this would imply that @xmath4 is a quotient of the cusp group @xmath127 ) , there is a bound on how deep into a cusp neighborhood the image of any @xmath126 may penetrate .",
    "hence , the @xmath126 all map into one compact subset of @xmath0 . additionally , the bound on the length of the @xmath126 implies that the sequence is equicontinuous .",
    "we can now apply the arzel - ascoli theorem to get that a subsequence of @xmath128 converges uniformly .",
    "therefore , for some large @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath126 is sufficiently close to @xmath131 that the two maps must be homotopic .",
    "this contradicts theorem  [ main_thm ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold .",
    "let @xmath132 be the set of minimal length carrier graphs for @xmath0 , and let @xmath123 be the length of any element of @xmath132 .",
    "elements of @xmath132 clearly have minimal length within their equivalence classes .",
    "thus , @xmath132 is contained in the set of carrier graphs which are of minimal length in their equivalence classes and have length less than or equal to @xmath123 .",
    "the latter set is finite , by virtue of proposition  [ prop ] .",
    "similarly , the set of carrier graphs of minimal length within a particular equivalence class is seen to be finite by letting @xmath123 be the length of any minimal length representative and applying proposition  [ prop ] in the same way .",
    "we will now give a new proof of the previously known result that a hyperbolic 3-manifold that does not have a simply - degenerate , @xmath19-surjective np - end has finite isometry group .",
    "the proof is simple and follows from theorem  [ finite ] and basic facts about minimal length carrier graphs .",
    "it requires knowing that such manifolds have minimal length carrier graphs , which was proved in  @xcite .",
    "that proof relies on the proof of the tameness theorem by agol and calegari - gabai .",
    "however , the tameness theorem is not needed for the case in which the 3-manifold is geometrically finite .",
    "thus , when the following theorem is restricted to geometrically finite 3-manifolds , its proof is entirely elementary .",
    "let @xmath132 be the set of essential equivalence classes of minimal length carrier graphs in @xmath0 . by theorem  1 of  @xcite ,",
    "this set is nonempty , and by theorem  [ finite ] , this set is finite .",
    "it is clear that @xmath20 acts on @xmath132 , which gives a map from @xmath20 to the finite group of permutations of @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath133 be the kernel of this map .",
    "it suffices to show that @xmath133 is finite .",
    "isometries of @xmath0 that are in @xmath133 fix a minimal length carrier graph @xmath2 up to essential equivalence .",
    "in particular , for some vertex @xmath111 , they fix @xmath134 and permute the images of the three edges attached to @xmath96 .",
    "this gives a map from @xmath133 to @xmath135 , the permutation group on three elements .",
    "an element @xmath22 of the kernel of this map would fix @xmath134 and the three tangent vectors at @xmath134 corresponding to the three edges of @xmath1 attached to @xmath96 .",
    "since the angles between these edges are all @xmath118 , these tangent vectors span a plane in the tangent space . lifting to @xmath107",
    ", @xmath136 would fix some preimage of @xmath134 and fix a hyperplane going through @xmath134 pointwise ( since it is an isometry and fixes the tangent plane ) .",
    "hence , @xmath22 must be the identity map .",
    "thus , @xmath133 injects into @xmath135 , which means that @xmath133 is finite .",
