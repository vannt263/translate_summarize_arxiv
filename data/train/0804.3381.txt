    "circumstellar disks have been observed around stars with a wide range of masses , from brown dwarfs to massive b stars ( e.g. , schreyer et al .",
    "2006 , luhman et al .",
    "disks facilitate accretion and angular momentum transport during the star formation process and provide a mass reservoir of gas and dust for the formation of planetary systems .",
    "planet formation in disks appears to be fairly common , with observed extrasolar planets now totalling over 250 objects ( e.g. , udry et al .",
    "the bulk of the initial gas and dust mass in disks around solar mass stars has a finite lifetime of order @xmath5 myr ( e.g. , haisch et al .",
    "2001 , sicilia - aguilar et al .",
    "2006 ) , many orders of magnitude smaller than stellar lifetimes , and this sets an upper limit on the formation time of giant planets .",
    "disk studies are largely based on measurements of the dust emission . in primordial disks , although the dust mass is much smaller than the gas mass , the dust is a strong emitter ( see review by watson et al .",
    "disks transition from a younger optically thick dust stage characterised by strong infrared continuum excesses , to an optically thin dust stage with weak infrared emission ( e.g. , najita et al .",
    "the census of optically thick young disks and disks with scant infrared excesses like the weak - lined t tauri stars ( wtts ) indicates that the initial optically thick epoch lasts @xmath6 myr ( e.g. , haisch et al .",
    "2001 ) , the transition phase is rather abrupt ( @xmath7myr , see hillenbrand 2007 ) , and that the wtts phase also lasts for @xmath8 a few myr .",
    "the missing small dust particles in wtts and/or transition disks may have coalesced to build planetary objects ( e.g. , quillen et al 2004 ) .",
    "however , observational studies of disks infer initial masses ( @xmath9 or 100 m@xmath10 ) much greater than that of the mass of planets around stars ( @xmath11 10 m@xmath10 ) , suggesting that much of the gas and dust is removed from the disk either by accretion onto the central star or by disk dispersal processes .",
    "the limited observations of gas in disks seem to broadly agree with the evolutionary sequence traced by dust emission , but dispersal timescales are less constrained at @xmath11 10 myr ( e.g. , zuckerman et al . 1995 , hollenbach et al . 2005 , pascucci et al .",
    "gas giant planets must necessarily form on these timescales before the gas disk disperses . as gas dominates the mass of giant planets and determines the dynamics of solid particles ( until gas mass becomes smaller than particulate mass ) , studies of the disk gas distribution and evolution are critical to understanding both planet formation and disk destruction processes .",
    "gas disk observations are difficult because of the inherently weak line emission of the primary constituent , h@xmath3 . as a result ,",
    "low abundance tracers are generally used to infer the presence of gas .",
    "gas emission lines have been observed from numerous nearby disks , mainly millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelength rotational transitions of @xmath12co , @xmath13co , hco@xmath14 , dco , hcn , cn , near - infrared vibrational lines of h@xmath3 and co , and more recently mid - infrared h@xmath3 pure rotational lines , as well as [ fei ] and [ neii ] emission ( e.g. , review by dutrey et al .",
    "2007 , pascucci et al .",
    "2007 , lahuis et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the excitation of these tracers is sensitive to the density and temperature of the gas as well as the chemical abundance of the emitting species .",
    "therefore , diagnosing gas disk parameters from the measured line intensities requires detailed models of the thermal , density and chemical structure of gas in the disk .",
    "detailed models of gas disks are recently becoming available in varying degrees of sophistication ( e.g. , kamp & dullemond 2004 , gorti & hollenbach 2004 , hereafter gh04 , jonkheid et al .",
    "2004 , glassgold et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 , nomura & millar 2005 , aikawa & nomura 2006 , nomura et al .",
    "2007 ) . predicted line emission from these models can be compared with observations to infer the physical conditions in disks .",
    "many existing gas disk models solve for the chemistry and gas temperature , but assume a disk vertical density structure that is derived from modeling the dust radiative transfer ( e.g. , glassgold et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 , semenov et al .",
    "2006 , meijerink et al .",
    "kamp & dullemond ( 2004 ) calculated the gas density and temperature by adopting the disk structure determined by the dust models of dullemond et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , whereas jonkheid et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and glassgold et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2007 ) use the dust disk model of d alessio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . because the gas temperature may differ from the dust temperature and the gas / dust ratio may change with vertical height",
    ", these calculations may be inconsistent with the condition of vertical pressure equilibrium .",
    "these inconsistencies are especially severe in the upper layers of disks where gas and dust temperatures can deviate significantly . moreover , most observed gas emission originates from these layers making any interpretation of data contingent on obtaining the correct gas temperatures and densities at these heights .",
    "gh04 and nomura & millar ( 2005 ) address this issue and self - consistently calculate the gas density and temperature as a function of disk radius and vertical height . in these models ,",
    "the dust temperature is separately determined and the gas temperature obtained from a detailed thermal balance and chemistry calculation , by considering various heating and cooling sources .",
    "gh04 only consider optically thin dust disks , but solve for the gas disk in detail with heating by dust collisions , x - rays , grain photoelectric heating due to far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation incident on very small grains , cosmic rays and exothermic photoreactions , and cooling by many atomic , ionic and molecular transitions . nomura & millar ( 2005 ) consider younger disks with optically thick dust , but their gas model is more simplistic .",
    "they consider heating by dust collisions , cosmic rays , and grain photoelectric heating , and cooling is only by oi , cii and co lines .",
    "aikawa & nomura ( 2006 ) recently extend these models to compute detailed disk chemistry , but use a disk structure ( density and temperature ) derived from the earlier simpler models , and nomura et al .",
    "( 2007 ) include the effects of x - ray heating .    our earlier models ( gh04 ) of gas emission from evolved",
    ", optically thin dust disks combined with recent _ spitzer _ observations of disks around stars of various ages ( feps legacy science program ) , found that disks with optically thin dust also have very little gas ( pascucci et al .",
    "we could set stringent limits on the gas mass using our models in conjunction with this data and estimated upper limits on gas disk lifetimes to be @xmath15 myrs .",
    "this result suggests that as inner ( @xmath16 au ) disks transition from optically thick to optically thin , they also lose much of their mass in gas .",
    "the same result was independently determined by a recent study of a large sample of disks in chameleon , where disk gas accretion rates were found to be correlated with the presence of an inner dust disk , suggesting that dust and gas are removed simultaneously from the inner disk ( damjanov et al .",
    "gas dispersal therefore presumably begins at earlier stages of evolution when the disks are still optically thick in dust .    in this paper , we extend our earlier detailed gas disk models ( gh04 ) to consider younger disks with optically thick dust .",
    "we are primarily concerned with calculating line emission from young disks that can be used as gas diagnostics to trace its distribution and structure at different evolutionary stages during its optically thick dust epoch .",
    "we also propose to use these disk models to compute the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation from stellar euv , fuv and x - ray photons in an accompanying paper .",
    "our models are constructed with the necessary physics to determine the disk thermal and chemical structure in the surface layers of the disk where line emission arises and photoevaporative flows originate .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the details of our disk models in  2 .",
    "we discuss the resulting disk structure and line emission in  3 . in  4 , we apply our models to observational data from the well - studied disk of tw hya and discuss the results .",
    "we summarize and conclude in  5 .",
    "the disk models presented here are an extension of gh04 .",
    "our earlier models were restricted to cases where the dust was optically thin to stellar radiation , keeping our dust radiative transfer simple . however , the gas transitions in these models could be optically thick or thin depending on gas column density , and gas radiative transfer was calculated using an escape probability formalism . in this paper",
    ", we generalize our models to consider optically thick dust and therefore allow modeling of younger disks which are opaque in the midplane regions to stellar visible photons . in most of our models , disks are also opaque to their own infrared photons .",
    "other improvements are the addition of new coolants such as fine structure lines of ne and ar ions and vibrational lines of co , heating by and chemistry of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , a mixture of dust chemical compositions , and a model for the euv heated surface layer .",
    "we treat in a separate paper the emission of fine structure lines such as [ neii]@xmath17 m from the euv - heated and completely ionized surface layer , and here only use the model to determine the vertical position of the ionization front that separates this layer from the predominantly neutral disk underneath it ( hollenbach et al .",
    "1994 ) . in this paper ,",
    "we do , however , treat the ionized fine structure lines such as [ neii]@xmath17 m produced in the `` neutral disk '' where x - rays partially ionize and heat the gas .",
    "we briefly summarize the disk model here and in the remainder of this section provide more details for the interested reader .",
    "our disk models solve for chemistry and thermal balance , and impose vertical hydrostatic equilibrium to separately calculate the density and gas and dust temperatures as a function of spatial location in the disk .",
    "we consider heating of the gas due to x - rays , grain photoelectric heating by pahs and small grains , cosmic rays , exothermic chemical reactions , formation heating of h@xmath3 , collisional de - excitation of vibrationally excited ( by fuv ) h@xmath3 , photodissociation and photoionization of molecules and atoms , and collisions with warmer dust grains .",
    "cooling of gas is by line emission from atoms , ions and molecules , and by collisions with cooler dust grains .",
    "our chemical network is moderate and focused towards including species that are dominant coolants in the disk ( enabling an accurate determination of the gas temperature ) .",
    "we treat gas and dust independently , and allow for different spatial distributions ( i.e. , a position - dependent gas / dust mass ratio ) , although we generally consider them well - mixed and the ratio constant throughout the disk .",
    "we consider a mixture of chemical compositions for the dust , and a range of grain size distributions .",
    "dust radiative transfer for optically thick dust disks is simplified , so as to keep the numerical disk model computations tractable .",
    "we use the two - layer model for dust with some modifications as first described by chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) .",
    "we include the effects of background infrared radiation due to dust on line transitions of the gas species ( see hollenbach et al .",
    "we emphasize that our models are hydrostatic , and assume steady - state chemistry and thermal balance .",
    "we also neglect freezing of gas species on to cold dust grains .",
    "this process is likely to be important only in the dense midplane of the outer disk ( e.g. , aikawa et al . 1999 , 2002 ) , a region unimportant for many of the considerations of this paper .",
    "accretion heating can be important in the dense midplane , especially of the inner disk ( e.g. , dalessio et al .",
    "we ignore this term , however , because we are interested in evolutionary stages of the disk when the accretion rates are low and because gas emission lines mostly originate from the upper layers of the disk . in the modeling procedure ,",
    "the input parameters include stellar characteristics , the initial gas phase abundances of the 10 elements , the surface density distribution , radial extent and dust properties .",
    "we then calculate the gas temperature , density and chemical structure as a function of spatial location @xmath18 throughout the disk .",
    "the properties of the central star are basic inputs to our disk models .",
    "when modeling observations of specific star - disk systems such as tw hya in  4 , stellar properties are taken from the available literature . in  3 of this paper , we aim to be more general and use typical stellar characteristics to construct standard or fiducial disk models that depict our calculations of the structure and line emission .",
    "the models presented in this paper assume _ steady - state _ thermal and chemical balance at a time when the disk surface density distribution follows a prescribed power law with radius .",
    "they are not time - dependent calculations . however",
    ", stellar properties evolve with time , the disk mass and surface density distribution evolve , and the accretion rate onto the central star decreases ( hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ) with time .",
    "younger stars have stronger radiation fields which would result in greater heating and enhanced emission line strengths . for our fiducial disk model",
    ", we use a _",
    "median _ set of stellar characteristics during this evolution , typical of a 1 - 2 myr old system .",
    "we use the pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks of siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to establish the basic properties of the star , such as its mass , radius , bolometric luminosity and effective temperature . in this paper",
    ", we focus on disks around 1m@xmath19 stars .    the radiation field created by the central star",
    "greatly affects the disk structure .",
    "disk models to date have primarily focused on the dust component which absorbs the optical photons from the star , and optical spectra of young stars are very well determined .",
    "gas is then assumed to be collisionally coupled with the dust and follow the same temperature distribution .",
    "however , in our models , we _ independently _ calculate the gas temperature .",
    "apart from indirect heating by stellar optical photons via collisions with the dust warmed by these photons , gas can also be heated by the ultraviolet and x - ray flux from the star .",
    "these photons also influence gas chemistry which can affect disk structure indirectly by influencing the cooling which sets the gas temperature structure ( see gh04 for details on these processes ) .",
    "hence we need to characterise the stellar spectrum at these shorter wavelengths , which are less well determined than the optical spectra .",
    "[ [ x - rays ] ] x - rays + + + + + +    recent observational studies using rosat and chandra have significantly furthered our understanding of the nature of the x - ray emission and pre - main - sequence magnetic activity of young stars ( e.g. , feigelson & montmerle 1999 , the coup project , feigelson et al .",
    "2005 , preibisch et al .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of low mass young stars is believed to mainly originate in the chromosphere and observed to be correlated with the bolometric luminosity , @xmath20 , although with a large scatter ( preibisch et al . 2005 ) . for more massive stars ,",
    "( m@xmath21 ) the x - ray luminosity decreases and @xmath22 ( preibisch et al .",
    "2005 , steltzer et al .",
    "we therefore scale the total x - ray luminosity of a star with its bolometric luminosity according to these empirical relations .",
    "x - rays originating from accretion processes peak at lower energies , and new chandra and xmm - newton x - ray spectroscopy of a few nearby , young accreting stars reveal both a low and high energy component ( telleschi et al . 2006 ) . since the x - ray absorption cross - section increases with decreasing photon energy ( wilms et al .",
    "2000 ) , a softer x - ray spectrum would heat the lower density gas at the disk surface , whereas harder x - ray photons will penetrate deeper into the disk to heat higher density gas .",
    "we therefore extend our x - ray spectrum from 0.1 to 10 kev . our adopted x - ray spectrum ( gdel et al .",
    "2007 , feigelson & montmerle 1999 , also see gh04 ) peaks at 2 kev and is approximated by a simple power - law with @xmath23 for @xmath24 kev and @xmath25 for @xmath26 kev .",

    "2003 , herzceg et al .",
    "the fuv flux appears correlated with the accretion rate , suggesting that accretion hotspots are the main cause of the uv excess , whereas significant fuv fluxes from low accretors also indicate a chromospheric component ( calvet & gullbring 1998 , valenti et al .",
    "for the purpose of this study , we follow the results of the various studies by gullbring et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2000 ) and assume that the fuv originates from accretion hotspots on the surface of the star .",

    "the median @xmath35 ratio for solar - mass stars was found to @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "we , however , adopt the semi - empirical approach of an accretion - rate determined fuv flux and spectrum , because of the uncertainties ( extinction , distances , stellar mass , age ) in converting the observed iue spectra to a mass - dependent fuv flux .",
    "the euv luminosity of young solar mass stars is very poorly constrained by observations , but believed to be generated by the active chromospheres from these stars ( e.g. , bouret & catala 1998 , alexander et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we therefore assume an euv luminosity similar in magnitude to that of the chromospheric fuv and x - ray luminosities , @xmath38 l@xmath39 .",
    "the photon luminosity @xmath40 is thus @xmath41 s@xmath33 for a 1m@xmath19 star , which then determines the location of the ionization front at the disk surface ( e.g. , hollenbach et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "stellar parameters of our fiducial disk model are listed in table  [ starpar ] .",
    "thermal energy exchange by collisions of gas with dust is one of the key processes in disks , which even at their surfaces ( @xmath42 to the central star ) have high gas densities ( @xmath43 @xmath44 ) compared to interstellar clouds .",
    "dust grains at the disk surface absorb stellar optical radiation , warming this surface layer .",
    "this warm thin layer with very little mass then heats the disk interior through re - radiation ( chiang & goldreich 1997 , dalessio et al .",
    "1998 , dullemond , dominik & natta 2001 ) . collisions with dust can either heat or cool the gas depending on whether the dust grains are hotter than or cooler than the gas .",
    "if they are well - coupled , gas and dust temperatures are nearly identical .",
    "however , the collisional coupling may be reduced by dust settling to the midplane , a process that can significantly decrease the local ratio of dust to gas mass ( @xmath45 the interstellar and disk primordial value ) and the dust cross sectional area per h nucleus , @xmath46 , near the surface of the disk . in addition , grains may have coagulated , a process that also decreases @xmath46 .",
    "the decrease in collisional coupling enhances the difference between the gas and dust temperatures ( gh04 , kamp & dullemond 2004 , jonkheid et al .",
    "2004 ) because of other possible processes that can affect the thermal balance of the gas .",
    "this is especially true at the disk surface where densities and opacities are lower .",
    "gas heating / cooling and disk structure thus depend on dust properties and are affected by both grain growth and settling .",
    "we consider dust grains to have a range of sizes , distributed according to the mrn power - law characteristic of dust in the interstellar medium ( @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the grain radius ) .",
    "we assume spherical grains and an interstellar dust composition .",
    "grain growth up to at least millimeters in size is inferred to occur in young circumstellar disks ( e.g. , van boekel et al .",

    "dust settling is also inferred with settling timescales in disks calculated to be rather short ( @xmath49 years at 1 au , dullemond & dominik 2004 ) , but observations indicate the presence of small dust even in the surfaces of evolved disks ( hernandez et al .",
    "2005 , furlan et al .",

    "we keep the minimum and maximum grain sizes constant in this work at 50   and 20@xmath2 m respectively , which lowers the opacity ( @xmath46 ) by a factor of @xmath50 from interstellar values ( where @xmath51 ) .",
    "grain growth in the disk will lead to an increase in @xmath52 in general .",
    "one would also expect that since small grains coagulate to form larger objects , @xmath53 might also increase .",

    "we therefore fix @xmath53 in our models .",
    "the important physical parameter in the models is the dust area per h atom , @xmath46 , which can be reduced either by increasing the dust grain sizes _ or _ by reducing the dust / gas mass ratio ( @xmath54 ) in the disk . in our modeling of dust properties",

    "to summarize , we model reductions in opacity due to grain growth or settling processes first by increasing @xmath52 to @xmath56 m and then subsequently by simply reducing the dust / gas mass ratio in the disk from its fiducial ( and interstellar ) value of @xmath58 .",
    "we consider one additional case with @xmath59 , or a reduction factor of 100 from our fiducial case .",

    "we use the gas escaping column densities calculated from chemical abundances in the previous chemical solution vertically through the disk .",
    "the vertical grid spacing is calculated in an adaptive manner and is not held constant .",
    "this is particularly important in order to resolve important transitions such as the h / h@xmath3 ( which also changes the number density of gas ) and c / co transitions as one approaches the disk surface .",
    "we track important coolants such as co and h@xmath3o as abrupt gradients in their abundances can lead to sudden changes in gas temperature and erratic solutions .",
    "when the abundance of an important coolant begins to change with @xmath133 , the grid spacing @xmath268 is made finer to resolve the transition and obtain a smooth solution . on an average @xmath269 vertical grid cells",
    "are required for each radial zone .",
    "vertical convergence is obtained with an average of 10 - 20 iterations and convergence is more rapid in the outer disk .",
    "our final disk solution is accurate to 2% in temperature and surface density .",
    "there are two desorption mechanisms that help clear grains of ice mantles in the intermediate layers of disks : ( i ) thermal desorption and ( ii ) fuv photodesorption .",
    "the grain temperature @xmath270 at which ice mantles thermally desorb can be calculated by equating the rate of gas phase molecules hitting and sticking to a grain to the flux of thermally desorbing molecules from the ice surface ( see hollenbach et al .",
    "@xmath271 here , @xmath272 is the gas density of species @xmath273 , @xmath274 is its thermal speed , @xmath48 is the grain radius , @xmath275 is the vibrational frequency of the adsorbed molecule , @xmath276 is the binding energy of the adsorbed molecule , and @xmath277 is the area occupied by a single adsorbed molecule . from this",
    "we find @xmath278 } } \\label{tgr}\\ ] ] using @xmath279k , @xmath280k , @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 ( hollenbach et al . 2008 , densities of h@xmath3o and co estimated from our models at @xmath284 au and a@xmath91=1 ) , we find @xmath285k and @xmath286k . in our models , the largest ( coldest ) grains are 85 k at 10 au and 20 k at @xmath8 140 au",
    ". therefore thermal desorption prevents substantial freeze - out of co in the intermediate layers of nearly our entire fiducial disk , and prevents h@xmath3o freeze - out only for @xmath287 au .",
    "hollenbach et al .",
    "( 2008 ) discuss photodesorption of water ice in molecular clouds .",
    "photodesorption will clear an ice mantle when the photodesorption rate from a grain covered with ice equals the sticking rate of water molecules from the gas .",
    "@xmath288 where @xmath289 is the fuv photon flux and @xmath290 is the photodesorption yield from water ice ( westley et al .",
    "1995 , andersson et al .",
    "2006 , hollenbach et al .",
    "@xmath289 is given approximately as @xmath291 where @xmath292 erg s@xmath33 is the fuv luminosity of the central star , and @xmath293 ergs is the typical energy of a photodesorbing fuv photon .",
    "from these equations , we find the critical radius @xmath294 inside of which water ice mantles are cleared due to phoodesorption @xmath295 note that a @xmath133 dependence enters because of the @xmath133 dependence of @xmath296 , a@xmath91 , and @xmath297 . taking fiducial values of @xmath298 @xmath44 and @xmath299 cm s@xmath33",
    "we find @xmath300 @xmath301 clearly , @xmath294 depends on @xmath296 , which is a function of both @xmath133 and @xmath98 .",
    "however , it appears from the fiducial value of @xmath298 @xmath44 taken from our model at @xmath284 au and at a@xmath91@xmath302 that photodesorption should clear our grains of water ice to a depth of a@xmath91@xmath303 .",
    "there is , however , an important caveat to these results .",
    "water ice may form on grain surfaces by the reaction of adsorbed o atoms with adsorbed h atoms , which forms adsorbed oh , followed by the reaction of adsorbed oh with adsorbed h to form adsorbed h@xmath3o ( see hollenbach et al . 2008 ) .",
    "for this to occur , the adsorbed o atom must not thermally desorb before an h atom strikes a grain .",
    "this requirement translates to @xmath304k or @xmath305 au for a@xmath91@xmath119 . beyond 50 au",
    "one can use eq .",
    "[ rcr ] to estimate the critical radius inside of which photodesorption clears ice mantles , but one needs to use the larger of @xmath306 or @xmath296 instead of @xmath296 .",
    "since @xmath307@xmath44 at a@xmath91@xmath302 and @xmath308 au , we find @xmath309 au .",
    "therefore , there is the possibility of water ice freeze - out for a@xmath91@xmath310 and @xmath311au .",
    "this could deplete the gas phase oxygen not in co and reduce somewhat the predicted luminosities of those lines whose greatest contributions come from these regions .",
    "we have tested the sensitivity of our results to freeze - out by calculating the expected luminosity of all our lines from our disk models where we omitted any emission from the freeze - out regions , implied by equations  [ tgr ] and [ rcr ] .",
    "we find that the longer wavelength transitions of water that arise mostly from low - lying states ( at @xmath312k ) can be less luminous than in table  5 by factors ranging from @xmath313 .",
    "the line luminosities for these transitions listed in table  5 should therefore be taken as upper limits , and we have marked them appropriately .",
