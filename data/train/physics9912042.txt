    "transition radiation ( tr ) is an electromagnetic radiation produced by ultrarelativistic charged particles crossing the interface between two materials with different dielectric properties @xcite .",
    "the tr spectrum is peaked in the x - ray region and the probability of a x - ray photon being emitted at each interface is of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "the transition radiation yield is proportional to the lorentz factor @xmath2 of the incident charged particle and is independent on the kind of particle . that offers an attractive alternative to identify particles of given momentum with a non destructive method .",
    "in order to enhance the tr x - ray production , radiators consisting of several hundred foils regularly spaced or irregular radiators of few @xmath3 of thickness consisting of carbon compound foam layers or fiber mats are usually adopted .",
    "the `` multilayer '' radiator introduces significant physical constraints on the radiation yield , because of the so - called `` interference effects '' .",
    "it has been established that the radiation emission threshold occurs at a lorentz factor @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the plasma frequency ( in units ) of the foil material , and @xmath6 is its thickness in . for @xmath7",
    "the radiation yield increases up to a saturation value given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the width of the gap between the foils @xcite .",
    "the conventional method of tr detection is the measurement of the sum of the energy released by ionization and from photoelectrons produced by tr x - rays . the radiating particle ,",
    "if not deflected by magnetic fields , releases its ionization energy in the same region as the x - ray photons , introducing a background signal that can be reduced if a gaseous detector is used . since the gas must provide efficient conversion of the tr photons , the use of high - z gases is preferred .",
    "the detector usually consists of proportional chambers filled with argon or xenon with a small addition of quenching gases for gain stabilization ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the measurement of tr using proportional chambers is generally based on one or both of the following methods :    * the `` charge measurement '' method , where the signal collected from a chamber wire is charge analyzed by adcs @xcite ; * the `` cluster counting '' method , where the wire signal is sharply differentiated in order to discriminate the x - ray photoelectron clusters producing pulses ( hits ) exceeding a threshold amplitude from the @xmath12-ray ionization background @xcite .    in both cases a cut on the analyzed charge or on the number of clusters",
    "is needed in order to discriminate radiating particles from slower nonradiating ones .",
    "multiple module trds , with optimized gas layer thickness , are normally employed to improve background rejection .",
    "a reduced chamber gap limits the particle ionizing energy losses , while the x - rays escaping detection may be converted in the downstream chambers .",
    "transition radiation detectors are presently of interest in fast particle identification , both in accelerator experiments @xcite and in cosmic ray physics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a trd is used to evaluate the underground cosmic ray muon energy spectrum in the gran sasso national laboratory @xcite . in spite of their use in several high energy experiments ,",
    "a simulation code is not yet available in the standard simulation tools .",
    "several codes based on parameterizations of test beam measurements have been developed to simulate the trds @xcite . lately",
    "a trd has been proposed in a long base neutrino oscillation experiment @xcite , in which a simulation has been developed using a geant interface @xcite .",
    "the results achieved in the last experience have been rather satisfactory , in spite of some difficulties to track low energy photons in geant .    in this paper a full simulation of a trd",
    "is described .",
    "the program is based on geant @xcite , garfield @xcite , magboltz @xcite and heed @xcite codes in order to exploit the best performances in each one . in this way",
    "a full simulation has been developed tracking the particles into the detector and producing the pulse shape from each proportional tubes .",
    "extensive theoretical studies have been made about tr .",
    "the basic properties of the tr production as well as the interference phenomena in multifoil radiator stacks are rather well understood and well described with classical electromagnetism ( for instance see @xcite ) .",
    "there was also an attempt to give a quantum description of tr @xcite .",
    "the quantum corrections to the tr intensity become interesting for the emission of very high energy photons , namely when the tr photon energy is comparable with the energy of the radiating particle .",
    "therefore they are no longer significant in the x - ray region for incident charged particle of momenta of few @xmath0 and the expressions derived are similar to the classical theory .",
    "therefore , the tr emission is described for practical purposes by classical formulation , and the tr energy is considered carried out by photons ( quanta ) .    as shown by artru et al .",
    "@xcite the tr energy @xmath13 emitted from a stack of @xmath14 foils of thickness @xmath6 at regular distances @xmath9 , without taking into account absorption effects , can be written as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy emitted at each interface . in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) @xmath17 is the angle between the incident particle and the tr x - ray , and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the tr quantum energy ( in units ) and @xmath20 are the plasma energies of the two media `` 1 '' ( foil ) and `` 2 '' ( gap ) .    the factor @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is due to the coherent superposition of tr fields generated at the two interfaces of one foil , with the phase angle @xmath22 being the ratio of the foil thickness @xmath6 ( in units ) to the `` formation zone '' @xmath23 of the foil material : @xmath24 the last factor of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) describes the coherent interference of tr in a stack composed of @xmath14 foils and gaps at regular distances @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath25 is the total phase angle of one basic foil plus gap , with @xmath26 being defined in analogy to @xmath27 .",
    "the tr x - ray energy distribution can be obtained by taking the ratio of equation ( [ e1 ] ) to @xmath19 .",
    "since the tr yield from multifoil stack is described as an interference phenomenon due to whole radiator , in order to calculate the total tr quanta emitted by the particle crossing the radiator , one needs to known the total number of foils crossed .",
    "therefore it is not possible to follow the particle into radiator in order to calculate the probability to emit a quantum in a given step , i.e. we do not have a cross section for the tr effect . that may introduce some difficulties to simulate the tr process .",
    "moreover , the tr intensity is a complex function of the thicknesses @xmath6 and @xmath9 , of the plasma energies @xmath28 and @xmath29 for a given @xmath2 lorentz factor .",
    "this behaviour may introduce an additional difficulty to calculate the tr spectra for any kind of radiators .",
    "the energy of the tr photons depends on the radiator material and its structure . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the average tr energy carried out by quanta is given by : @xmath30 assuming @xmath31 and @xmath32 one obtains @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this may introduce some difficulties to track soft x - ray photons in a medium .",
    "the ability to identify particles by a trd is determined by the relative amounts of tr and ionization energy loss in the proportional chambers .",
    "large fluctuations of ionization loss in thin gas layers limit this methods .",
    "therefore , in order to better understand the performance of a trd , one needs careful calculations of ionization energy loss and its fluctuations , producing knock - on or @xmath12-electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "if one would like to use the cluster counting method to separate the tr x - ray from the track ionization background , then the range and the size of @xmath12-electron and of photoelectron , the number of electron  ion pairs produced in the gas and their arrival time on the wire need to be taken into account .",
    "finally the current produced on the anode wire of the gas chambers and its pulse shape fed to discriminator by the front end electronics also play an important role in this method .",
    "on the basis of the above discussion , the approach followed to simulate a trd is based on the codes geant , garfield , magboltz and heed ( the last two codes are used by garfield ) .",
    "the geometric description of the detector has been given by geant , including the simulation of all physical processes that occur in the materials crossed by the particles .",
    "the ionization energy loss and the photoelectric process in the gas have been not considerated in the geant code , because they are simulated by heed .",
    "when charged particles cross the gas of proportional chambers , or photons are entering into these volumes , the heed package is called . in this way the ionization energy loss and the electron ",
    "ion pairs distribution along the track are calculated .",
    "the photoelectric absorption of photons in the gas is also simulated , including the evaluation of the photoelectrons produced and the total number of electron  ion pairs .",
    "finally the current pulse produced on the anode wire is evaluated by the garfield code using the gas properties as its drift velocity and gain calculated by the magboltz program as a function of the electric field .",
    "the geant code does not simulate transition radiation . in order to produce the tr photons in geant",
    ", a physical process has been introduced whenever a relativistic charged particle crosses the radiator .",
    "the tr photon energy spectrum and the mean number of x - ray are calculated for the input radiator and for the energy of primary particle which one simulates . when the charged particle crosses the radiator and comes out the tr process is activated .",
    "the total number of tr photons is generated according to a poisson distribution if their average number is less than 10 , otherwise a gaussian distribution may be used .",
    "the energy of each tr x - ray is randomly generated according to a calculated spectrum and its position is generated along the radiating particle path at the end of a radiator .",
    "the produced tr photons are then treated as secondary particles in geant and they are stored in the common block gcking . in order to be transported by geant , these photons are stored in the data structure jstak by the gsking routine .",
    "the tr production relations used in this simulation take into account the photon absorption in the radiator .",
    "this effect has been simulated using the geant absorption lengths of the photons calculated for this material . + * regular radiator * + the energy distribution of tr photons for a stack of plates taking into account the absorption in the foils and gaps is given by @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the absorption in one foil + one gap and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the absorption lengths for the emitted radiation in two media as calculated by geant ( see paragraph [ p3.2 ] ) .    for large values of the number of foils @xmath14 , the @xmath12 function",
    "can be assumed to approximate the last two factors of the above expression .",

    "( [ e6 ] ) .",
    "this figure shows a broad peak around @xmath49 energy , corresponding to tr mean energy produced by the regular radiator adopted .",
    "+ * irregular radiator * + the transition radiation has been observed in irregular materials consisting for instance of plastic foams .",
    "a general formulation of the spectral distribution of the number of tr x - ray quanta produced in a irregular medium , consisting of randomly parralel plates of arbitrary thickness , is given by garibian et al .",
    "@xcite . this formulation has been given with the plates arranged in vacuum .",
    "it has been modified to take into account the presence of a material in the gap .",
    "the average number of radiation quanta taking into account the absorption of the radiation is given by : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the factor due to the superpositions of the radiation fields in the plates and in the gap .",

    "it has been done by the standard geant routine taking care of tracking parameters in order to define the active physical processes and the cuts ( gstpar ) . in this way",
    ", the photons are tracked using the geant absorption coefficients and the gamma cuts have been lowered to @xmath46 in all the materials .    the materials used , which are not defined in the default geant program ,",

    "the radiators have been defined as a mixture composed by the foil material and the gap material ( air ) containing the proportion by weights of each material .",

    "one can see that the kapton photon attenuation length is always less than polyethylene and the photon attenuation length for kapton is the same as for mylar .",
    "the gas chambers are the sensitive volume of the trd and for each charged particle crossing the gas or for each photons absorbed inside , a geant hits structure is defined to describe the interaction between particle and detector . in the hits structure",
