    "the fast dynamics of a quantum electron gas confined in nanoscale systems including quantum wells , quantum dots and metal clusters is receiving a great deal of interest @xcite . among possible collective motions , one has the electric dipole response , the so - called kohn mode @xcite , associated to rigid oscillations of the electron gas at the trapping frequency .",
    "other fundamental collective oscillations are the breathing modes , characterized by a pulsating electron cloud .",
    "such breathing modes have been investigated through numerical simulation of the n - body time - dependent schrdinger equation for restricted number of particles , exploring large energy coupling parameter regimes @xcite . soon later , a variational approach based on a mean - field",
    ", quantum hydrodynamic model has been used to analytically describe the nonlinear breather dynamics of an one - dimensional electron gas in a semiconductor quantum well @xcite .",
    "a time - dependent rayleigh - ritz method was employed in order to reduce the underlying quantum fluid model to a set of nonlinear second - order ordinary differential equations .",
    "the numerical analysis of the kinetic , wigner - poisson system was shown to be in agreement with the analytical results . in the present work we make a first step toward the extension of this approach to three spatial dimensions .",
    "in the mean - field approximation , the electron dynamics can be described by a self - consistent quantum hydrodynamic model that was also applied for quantum plasmas @xcite and metallic nanostructures @xcite . here",
    "only electrostatic fields are considered .",
    "then the evolution of the electron fluid density @xmath0 and the electron fluid velocity @xmath1 follows from the continuity and momentum equations , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the effective electron mass , @xmath4 planck s constant divided by @xmath5 , @xmath6 the electron fluid pressure and @xmath7 the effective potential , which is composed by a confining @xmath8 and a hartree @xmath9 terms .",
    "the hartree potential obeys poisson s equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the magnitude of the electron charge and @xmath12 is the effective dielectric permeability in the semiconductor quantum well .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath13 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) is associated to the so - called bohm potential and is responsible for the quantum wave - like effects .    for the confinement suppose the generally anisotropic potential @xmath14 where @xmath15 are dimensionless constants , not necessarily equal .",
    "moreover , the frequency @xmath16 can be related to a fictitious homogeneous positive charge of density @xmath17 through @xmath18 .",
    "it is convenient to normalize time to @xmath19 , space to @xmath20 [ where @xmath21 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath22 the temperature ] , density to @xmath17 , velocity to @xmath23 , pressure to @xmath24 and energy to @xmath25 .",
    "these are the same rescaled variables as in refs .",
    "@xcite . for simplicity , old and new variables",
    "will be represented by the same symbols .",
    "the model equations then become @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the diagonal dyad with components @xmath28 .",
    "quantum effects are measured by the dimensionless parameter @xmath29 in addition , in the new coordinates we have @xmath30 in order to close the system , the pressure in eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) must be related to the electron fluid density . in the fast time - scale implied by the trapping frequency ,",
    "an adiabatic equation of state is indicated , since there is no sufficient time for thermalization . in this",
    "regard , the temperature parameter @xmath22 can be interpreted as a measure of the average kinetic energy per electron .",
    "hence we choose the polytropic relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the three - dimensional polytropic exponent , and @xmath33 a reference density , whose choice will be discussed later .",
    "let us make an estimate of the parameters in the model . for semiconductor quantum wells @xcite ,",
    "typically we have : the effective electron mass and the effective dielectric permeability are , respectively , @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the equilibrium density is @xmath36 .",
    "these values yield an effective plasmon energy @xmath37 , a characteristic length @xmath38 , a fermi temperature @xmath39 k , and a typical time scale @xmath40 fs .",
    "an electron temperature @xmath41 then corresponds to a value @xmath42 .",
    "in order to derive a closed system of ordinary differential equations in which time is the independent variable , we first express the quantum hydrodynamical equations in a lagrangian formalism .",
    "this approach is not based on a perturbative expansion , and is thus not restricted to the linear regime .",
    "a lagrangian density corresponding to the system read as @xmath43 ^ 2 + \\frac{h^2}{4n}\\,\\left[\\nabla\\,n\\right]^2\\right ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the independent fields are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the velocity field follows from the auxiliary function @xmath46 through @xmath47 the quantity @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) originates from the pressure , @xmath49 taking the variational derivatives of the action @xmath50 with respect to @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath9 , we obtain the eqs .",
    "( [ f1])([f3 ] ) .    the existence of a variational formalism can be used to derive approximate solutions via the time - dependent rayleigh - ritz trial - function method .",
    "the electron density can be taken in the form of an anisotropic gaussian , @xmath51 while the self - consistent electrostatic field can be taken as @xmath52 where the variable @xmath53^{1/2}\\ ] ] was introduced . here",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 are time - dependent functions respectively related to the width and center - of - mass coordinate of the electronic cloud . in addition",
    ", @xmath56 is a numerical constant directly related to the number of electrons in the quantum well , @xmath57 finally , erf is the error function , defined by @xmath58 the arguments in favour of the selected profile are : it describes a localized solution amenable to relatively simple analytical calculations ; the ground state for the three - dimensional anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator is a gaussian .",
    "hence we have an exact solution for negligible hartree and pressure terms ; in the radially symmetric case ( @xmath59 ) the proposed form is an exact solution for poisson s equation .",
    "according to the last reasoning , in principle the model becomes less accurate in strongly anisotropic cases .    to complete the ansatz",
    ", we need to specify the velocity field , which we choose so as to exactly solve the continuity equation for the given @xmath44 .",
    "hence we take the linear form @xmath60 for the @xmath61component of the velocity field .    since @xmath62 , the variable @xmath45 in the lagrangian density",
    "can be written as @xmath63 ignoring an irrelevant additive purely time - dependent contribution .",
    "now a system of newton equations for @xmath64 can be derived .",
    "apart from a multiplicative factor , the lagrangian turns out to be @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are pseudo - potentials resp . for the breathing and dipole motions .",
    "examining @xmath68 we find : the term with @xmath69 is due to the harmonic confinement ; the @xmath70 term is due to the bohm potential ; the @xmath71 terms are due to the self - consistent hartree energy ; the @xmath72 term is due to the thermodynamic pressure .    clearly the dipole and electronic cloud width dynamics are decoupled , a feature of harmonic traps .",
    "the dipole motion is linear , @xmath73 corresponding to kohn oscillations . on the other hand , the @xmath54",
    "execute coupled nonlinear oscillations .",
    "the equations for the breathing motion read @xmath74 where @xmath75 a more detailed investigation of the dynamical system ( [ kepler ] ) will be postponed to future work .",
    "instead , in the following the radial case is considered .",
    "assuming @xmath76 , the breather equation reduces to @xmath77 before proceeding , we can now define the parameter @xmath78 in the equation of motion , and we do this using thermodynamic arguments . in terms of our gaussian _ ansatz _ , we can expect @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the equilibrium value of the variance @xmath81 . hence @xmath82 is not negligible even if @xmath83 , which means neglecting the self - consistent interaction .",
    "taking the simultaneous limits @xmath84 with fixed @xmath82 we have @xmath85 on the other hand , restoring physical coordinates and assuming energy equipartition , we have the ensemble averages @xmath86 which can be also thought as the definition of the temperature parameter @xmath22 . supposing @xmath87 we find @xmath88 . going back to the rescaled variables , we expect @xmath89 to be the equilibrium value in accordance with energy equipartition , neglecting hartree and quantum terms . on these grounds , from eq .",
    "( [ xx ] ) we have @xmath90 in a first approximation , the above choice is adopted also for the @xmath91 case .",
    "therefore we get @xmath92 or @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a pseudo - potential defined by @xmath95 from the shape of the pseudo - potential ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) , it follows that @xmath81 will always execute nonlinear oscillations around the unique minimum @xmath96 , which is a solution of the algebraic equation @xmath97 , or @xmath98     for arbitrary @xmath99    the frequency @xmath100 of the breather mode , corresponding to the oscillations of @xmath81 , can be obtained by linearizing the equation of motion in the vicinity of the minimum of @xmath94 . in other words",
    ", we use @xmath80 from eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) plugging it in @xmath101 the last equality following from eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) and showing that @xmath102 in the absence of self - consistent interaction .",
    "a consistency check can be performed neglecting the hartree potential , which yields the equilibrium variance @xmath103 this expression displays the correct low- and high - temperature limits for the quantum harmonic oscillator : @xmath104 for @xmath105 ; and @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "these estimates can be found from standard calculations on the canonical ensemble of quantum harmonic oscillators @xcite .    since from eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) we automatically have @xmath108 we conclude that @xmath109 which further confirms the repulsive effect of the hartree potential .    on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) shows that for large hartree parameter we have @xmath110 using this in eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) we find that @xmath111 for large @xmath56 .",
    "we can define @xmath112 as the average electron fluid density , where the average is calculated using the density iteself , at the equilibrium value @xmath113 .",
    "using @xmath44 for calculating expectation values is reasonable since it corresponds to the quantum probability density function .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows that the breather frequency depends weakly on the parameter @xmath114 ( and hence on the electron fluid temperature ) .",
    "the density @xmath115 is shown to decrease with @xmath114 .",
    "this follows since quantum diffraction effects tend to enlarge the width of the electronic cloud , which for fixed number of electrons means a smaller density .",
    ".equilibrium width @xmath80 , breather frequency @xmath116 and mean particle density @xmath115 for @xmath117 and various values of @xmath114 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work , we derived the basic equations for the three - dimensional variational description for the many - electron of a quantum electron gas in a semiconductor quantum well .",
    "the first results on the associated linear breathing frequencies were then obtained .",
    "the analytic calculations should be confronted against numerical simulation of the wigner - poisson system , as made in the one spatial dimension case in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the adequacy of the gaussian profile proposed here in the case of large hartree energy should be investigated . moreover , the effect of the coupled dipole - breather dynamics in non - parabolic wells is also an interesting issue , since in this case the breather mode can be triggered using a purely dipolar excitation @xcite .",
    "standard pump - probe experiments can then be used to optically detect the breather mode .",
