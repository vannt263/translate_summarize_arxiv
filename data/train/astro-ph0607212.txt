    "the combined detection of extrasolar planets by radial velocimetry and transit photometry provides unique information by the measurement of both their mass and radius .",
    "further spectroscopic studies of the system in and off transit can then even inform us on chemical species in the planet s atmosphere , its possible evaporation , global atmospheric temperature , possible presence of winds , etc .",
    "nine transiting extrasolar planets have been discovered so far ( see www.obspm.fr/planets ) .",
    "eight of them have radii of 1.01.3 jupiter s radius ( @xmath9 ) , but one stands out : hd149026b has a radius of only @xmath10 for a mass of @xmath11 jupiter s mass ( @xmath12 ) and an orbital distance of 0.042au @xcite . the parent star is believed to be 1.3m@xmath13 , and is metal - rich with @xmath14=0.36\\pm 0.05 $ ] .",
    "contrary to the other transiting extrasolar planets , believed to be mainly formed with hydrogen and helium @xcite , hd149026b is _ clearly _ made of a significant fraction of heavy elements .",
    "indeed , based on evolution models , @xcite and then @xcite have shown the planet has a huge rock / ice core of @xmath15 . as noted by @xcite , such a big core points toward formation of the planet in the core accretion scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rather than in the disk instability scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , hd149026b may even challenge the core accretion scenario , because the core mass is far larger than that of jupiter or saturn , and the `` canonical '' critical core mass as derived by @xcite is around @xmath16 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to constrain the structure of hd149026b , to examine how the planet may have formed based on these constraints , and , hopefully , to stimulate further studies of the formation of close - in giant planets . in section  [ sec : present_structure ] , we attempt to constrain the structure of hd149026b based on various evolution models . in section  [ sec : accretion ] , we then examine whether these constraints are compatible with the properties of growing protoplanetary cores embedded in a gaseous circumstellar disk . on these bases ,",
    "various possibilities for the formation of this planet are explored in section [ sec : possibilities ] .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] summarizes the results and proposes two possible formation scenarios that account for the properties of hd149026b .",
    "as already evident from the measurements and from previous models of the evolution of the planet @xcite , hd149026b is surprisingly small , and should possess either a big core or a large amount of heavy elements in its interior . in this work ,",
    "we attempt to constrain the core mass by using a variety of evolutionary models beyond those explored by sato et al . and fortney et al .",
    "in doing so , we will show that hd149026b indeed contains a significant amount of heavy elements , in apparent contradiction with current models of the formation of giant planets .",
    "the evolution of a giant planet is essentially governed by a kelvin - helmholtz cooling and contraction similar to a stellar pre - main sequence evolution but slightly modified by degeneracy effects , and by the intense stellar irradiation that slows the cooling through the growth of a deep radiative region that can extend to kbar levels @xcite .",
    "the level of the irradiation received by the planet is calculated from the observations by @xcite : we adopt values of the stellar radius ( @xmath17 ) and temperature ( @xmath18k ) and the orbital distance of @xmath19  au to derive zero - albedo equilibrium temperature @xmath20k .",
    "we use this value as a minimum for the atmospheric temperature at the 1 bar level ( the corresponding temperature found by @xcite is between 2000 and 2200k , and using the model of @xcite , we find a value of 1980k ) .",
    "we use the 1 bar level as outer boundary condition for the evolution models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "standard models are calculated on the basis of structure consisting of a central rock / ice core and of an envelope of solar composition , and further assuming that the planet has either formed _ in situ _ or moved rapidly to its present location , so that throughout its evolution it has received a constant stellar heat flux to slow its cooling .    for the core",
    ", we use the equations of state for `` rocks '' and `` ices '' obtained by @xcite .",
    "for the envelope , we use the h - he eos from @xcite .",
    "the structure of the core with @xcite s eos is independent of its temperature , but this simplification is reasonable because it has much smaller effects than changes in the ( unknown ) core composition .",
    "although it has little effect on the models , we assume that the core luminosity is due both to radioactive decay ( with @xmath21 ) and cooling ( assuming that in the core the temperature is uniform and the specific heat is @xmath22 ) .",
    "internal opacities are calculated from rosseland opacity tables provided by @xcite .",
    "the calculations are made for various core masses and core compositions and compared to the observational constraints in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol_std ] . as discussed by @xcite and by @xcite",
    ", the small planetary radius implies that it contains a large fraction of its mass in heavy elements .",
    "difference in composition of the core  whether these heavy elements are mostly `` ices '' ( a mixture of water , ammonia and methane in their [ unknown ] high pressure , relatively high temperature form ) or `` rocks '' ( a mixture of refractory materials including mostly silicates)affects the radius of the planet by 10 to 20% . for comparison ,",
    "the interiors of uranus and neptune are consistent with being mostly made of `` ices '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : evol_std ] thus confirms the need for a substantial amount of heavy elements in hd149026b when adopting a standard evolution scenario .",
    "quantitatively , this implies core masses between 41 and 83m@xmath23 in good agreement with @xcite and @xcite",
    ". in particular , the latter yields values between 60 and 93m@xmath23 .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that in order to constrain more strictly the minimum mass of heavy elements present in the planet , we used a low value of the atmospheric temperature .",
    "we now investigate the hypothesis that the planet may have cooled far from its parent star before suddenly being sent into the presently observed 0.046  au orbit .",
    "the reason for this sudden event is to be determined , but could be due to dynamical planet - planet interactions ( see section [ sec : late_z_supply ] ) . in terms of evolution , the planet is allowed to cool more rapidly during the time - period when it is far from the parent star .",
    "the sudden inward migration indeed yield an expansion of the planet but it may be limited to the outer layers and thus be relatively small @xcite . we want to investigate whether the present mass and radius are compatible with a relatively small core .",
    "we thus calculate evolution models similar to those in the previous section , but using @xmath24k and an atmospheric model based on simplified radiative transfer calculations of an isolated atmosphere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on these calculations , we obtain generally a much faster contraction of the planet ; a less than 30@xmath25 core can account for the observed radius .",
    "however , we have to include reheating of the outer shell of the envelope .",
    "this shell is approximatively defined by the region whose temperature is lower than the new equilibrium temperature , 1740k . based on our calculations , this corresponds to a pressure level of @xmath2610kbar .",
    "a simple estimation of the reheating timescale of the outer shell suggests that we have to include this effect . using equations of radiative diffusion and energy conservation",
    ", we estimate that the reheating timescale of a layer of pressure @xmath27 , temperature @xmath28 , opacity @xmath29 and heat capacity @xmath30 is to first order independent of its initial temperature and equal to : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the radiation density constant , @xmath33 the speed of light , and @xmath34 the planet s gravity ( assumed uniform ) .",
    "this expression is consistent with direct simulations by @xcite .",
    "this timescale is about @xmath35years for @xmath36 , @xmath37kbar , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which implies that the reheating is relatively fast and should involve most of the shell that we defined .",
    "however , the expansion due to the reheating is relatively small .",
    "the @xmath41 dependence ensures that most of this outer shell will be affected , and it will expand by a radius estimated to be : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the new pressure scale height and @xmath44 measures the depth of the expanding shells in pressure units .",
    "based on our simulations , a rough estimate is that the planet should expand by @xmath45 cm ( @xmath46 ) when considering levels between 10kbar and 1 bar .",
    "note that this estimate does not include factors such as global reheating due to tidal dissipation caused by the necessary circularization of the planet s spin and eccentricity .",
    "if such dissipation occurs sufficiently deep in the planet , this will lead to an expansion of the planet s deeper layers that could completely erase the planet s cold evolution phase ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "thus , this very possibility that a planet can contract more efficiently far away from the star and then be brought in with little consequence on its radius is very much in question .",
    "we choose however to consider it because it gives a sense of the robustness of the conclusion that hd149026b contains a large fraction of heavy elements .",
    "cccc & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 +   +  ices & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & 0.520.72 +  rocks & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & 0.430.60 +   +  ices & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & 0.390.67 +  rocks & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & 0.330.53 +   + & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & 0.330.72 +    adding @xmath60 ( @xmath61 cm ) to the radius obtained by the evolution calculation of the isolated planet ( not including the global reheating ) , we derive masses of heavy elements that reproduce the observed radius and show these in table  [ tab : constraints ] . even in the case of a long storage ( @xmath62 years ) of the planet in a cold environment ( corresponding to more than 10  au ) , a large amount of heavy elements ( strictly more than 33m@xmath23 ) is required to reproduce the observed radius of hd149026b .",
    "we have thus far assumed all heavy elements to lie within a central core . in order to see how the results are dependent on this assumption ,",
    "we compare our previous model with a 60m@xmath23 ice core to a similar model with a 30m@xmath23 ice core and an envelope which is enriched by 30m@xmath23 of ices . for the ices in the envelope , we use the eos described by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : evol_opa ] shows the results of the calculations in the two cases : ( i ) with unchanged opacities ( i.e. , as calculated for a solar - composition mixture ) and ( ii ) with 30 times larger opacities to mimic the effect of the enrichment of heavy elements in the envelope .",
    "basically , when using an unchanged opacity table ( the dotted line ) , there is very little difference between a planet that has all its heavy elements in the core and a planet that has them mixed throughout its envelope .",
    "however , large differences arise when the opacities are affected proportionally to the amount of heavy elements that are mixed ( the dashed line ) . in that case , the cooling and contraction timescale , which is dominated by radiative transport in the outer radiative zone , becomes long , and prevents the rapid contraction of the planet .",
    "these results confirm again that our estimates of the amount of heavy elements in hd149026b are lower limits and that the planet indeed must contain a significant amount of heavy elements .",
    "if most of the heavy elements are located below the radiative zone , which is not unlikely , then we expect our constraints to be relatively accurate . on the other hand ,",
    "if the material is mixed in the outer radiative zone , we expect that its interior contains more heavy elements by up to @xmath63 than calculated here .",
    "we have used a rather simplified approach for the calculations of the interior structure . on the other hand , reality is without doubt more complex .",
    "however , this should not affect significantly the global constraints that are derived in table  [ tab : constraints ] .",
    "first , the two extreme compositions used for the heavy elements ( `` ices '' and `` rocks '' ) ensure that most variations due to improved eos , for example , are likely to fall in between the range of values that are considered .    our external boundary condition is extremely simplified .",
    "although it agrees with more detailed atmospheric models , one has to account for the fact that the atmospheric temperatures may be higher , in particular if the atmosphere is itself enriched in heavy elements ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a higher atmospheric temperature leads to a slightly larger radius , everything else being the same .",
    "however , given the decrease of the opacity with increasing temperature in that regime , the radius increase is very limited .",
    "other factors point toward a slightly larger amount of heavy elements than calculated here : ( i ) as discussed , the likely increase of the opacities in an enriched envelope ; ( ii ) the presence of any other energy source such as the one that is required to reproduce the radius of hd209458b ; ( iii ) thermally - dependent eos for the core . again , given that the core mass is already quite large , we expect these factors not to change the masses of heavy elements that are inferred above .",
    "the structure of hd149026b as derived in the previous section is certainly puzzling : it contains as much hydrogen and helium as saturn , but at least twice as much heavy elements . in other words ,",
    "the ratio of heavy elements to hydrogen and helium is intermediate between those of saturn and uranus / neptune . in the core accretion scenario ,",
    "when core mass exceeds a critical value ( called the _ critical core mass _ ) , the kelvin - helmholtz contraction of the envelope takes place , resulting in substantial disk - gas accretion onto the planet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a widespread idea is that jupiter and saturn experienced the substantial gas accretion beyond the critical core mass , while the cores of uranus and neptune remained subcritical because of progressive accretion of planetesimals until the gaseous circumstellar disk disappeared @xcite . in this section",
    ", we investigate whether hd149026b may have formed in a way similar to what envisioned for uranus and neptune .",
    "figure [ fig : critical_core_mass ] shows the critical core mass ( @xmath64 ) as a function of core accretion rate for several different choices of distance from the parent star and local density of disk gas . in the numerical simulations we have used the h",
    "- he eos from @xcite , the grain opacity from @xcite , and the gas opacity from @xcite .",
    "the integration method is basically the same as that of @xcite who used simpler forms of eos and gas and grain opacities .",
    "the input physics used here is somewhat different from that used in section  [ sec : present_structure ] .",
    "first we include grain opacity that was not included in the simulations in section 2 , because an accreting envelope contains low temperature parts in which grain opacity is dominant , unlike the fully - formed planet ( @xmath65  k ) .",
    "although the fully - formed planet also contains such low temperature parts in the cold storage model , the planet is almost fully convective .",
    "second the gas opacity used in this simulation is different from that used in the previous section .",
    "this difference has little influence on the results obtained in this section , because most of the part of the envelope where gas opacity is dominant relative to grain opacity is convective . finally ,",
    "although constant core density is assumed here , the critical core mass is known to be insensitive to core density @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : critical_core_mass ] shows a large subcritical core can be formed if core accretion rate is high .",
    "high core accretion rates stabilize the envelope , yielding progressively larger critical core masses @xcite .",
    "this , however , remains true up to a point for which the envelope becomes fully convective ; the structure of a fully convective envelope is almost adiabatic and thus independent of energy flux supplied by incoming planetesimals ( i.e. , core accretion rate ) . at that point",
    ", the critical core mass reaches its maximum value . in this case , this _ maximal _ critical core mass depends on the local disk conditions ( i.e. , the local density and temperature of disk gas and the distance from the parent star ) @xcite . in the minimum - mass solar nebula ( msn ) proposed by @xcite , the entropy of the disk gas decreases as the distance to the parent star decreases .",
    "that is why the critical core mass is smaller at locations closer to the parent star : in a denser gas disk , the critical core mass is smaller for the same reason @xcite . as a result ,",
    "formation of a large subcritical core of 5080  @xmath25 requires not only high core accretion rate , but also a location not too close to its parent star and not too massive gaseous disk .",
    "although a large core of 5080 @xmath25 can , in principle , be formed by subcritical growth as shown above , the ratio of the critical core mass to the corresponding total ( core + envelope ) mass suggests that the core mass of hd149026b was likely to be supercritical .",
    "figure [ fig : critical_ratio ] shows the ratio of core mass to planetary total mass as a function of core mass ( normalized by the critical core mass ) for three different sets of core accretion rate and distance from the parent star .",
    "this ratio is found to be rather insensitive to values of the parameters ; it is always @xmath6 at the critical core mass .",
    "the evolution model of hd149026b obtained in section [ sec : present_structure ] shows that the current ratio of core mass to planetary mass is smaller in most cases ( see table  [ tab : constraints ] ) .",
    "although there are a few cases where the current ratio is as large as @xmath6 , the probability of the formation of such planets seems to be low . from fig .",
    "[ fig : critical_ratio ] we also find the duration during which the ratio of core mass to planetary mass is around @xmath6 is quite short in the total core formation time .",
    "it follows from this consideration that hd149026b is likely to have experienced disk - gas accretion due to the kelvin - helmholtz contraction of the envelope .    the rate of the gas accretion determined by the kelvin - helmholtz contraction of the envelope beyond the critical core mass  the gas accretion is hereafter called the kh gas accretion",
    " depends strongly on the critical core mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : kh ] shows the typical timescale ( @xmath66 ) for the kh gas accretion defined by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the gravitational constant , @xmath64 is the critical core mass , @xmath69 is the corresponding envelope mass , @xmath70 is the outer radius of the inner convective region , and @xmath71 is the luminosity @xcite . the numerical factor , @xmath72 , is chosen to be @xmath73 based on the numerical simulations by @xcite . in cases where core accretion is suddenly stopped ( corresponding to core isolation ; see below ) , @xmath72 should be @xmath74 @xcite . on this timescale the envelope mass increases by a factor of @xmath75 .",
    "the timescale for the kh gas accretion is approximately expressed by @xmath76 in this range ) is different from that of equation  ( 19 ) of @xcite .",
    "the difference comes mainly from the difference in grain opacity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the detailed discussion ) .",

    "thus , supply of a large amount of planetesimals may be unlikely to happen during gas accretion .",

    "* ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the scattering comes from secular perturbation , @xmath75 is increased secularly while @xmath32 is kept constant .",
    "accordingly , @xmath124 decreases secularly , and the incoming bodies eventually collide with the inner planet .",
    "for example , the following scenario is possible .",
    "more than three giant planets in addition to the inner one are formed in nearly circular orbits .",
    "they start orbit crossing on timescales longer than their formation timescales @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "one giant planet is ejected and the residual giant planets remain in stable eccentric orbits after the orbit crossing @xcite . in about 1/3 cases ,",
    "@xmath124 of a giant planet decreases secularly to @xmath139  au due to the kozai effect @xcite during the orbit crossing @xcite .",
    "this scenario requires formation of at least four giant planets .",
    "gas accretion onto a core can be truncated by gap opening or global depletion of disk gas .",

    "the former is that the torque exerted by the planet overwhelms viscous torque , and given by @xcite , @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the planet mass and @xmath142 is the parameter for the @xmath142-prescription for disk viscosity @xcite .",
    "the latter condition is that the hill radius becomes larger than disk scale height , and given by ) is equal to 1.5 times disk scale height ( @xmath143 ) , roughly taking into account late gas accretion with a reduced rate after @xmath144 , following @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath145 assuming an optically thin disk in which @xmath146  k. hence , the actual truncation condition may be the thermal condition and it is very unlikely that gas accretion is truncated by the gap opening at @xmath147 ( which corresponds to hd149026b ) far from the parent star , as long as a sufficient amount of disk gas remains .",
    "furthermore , since the gap is replenished by viscous diffusion , gas accretion may not completely be truncated by the gap opening @xcite .",
    "if a sufficient amount of disk gas remains , one way to truncate gas accretion at relatively small planetary mass is that the planet migrates to the vicinity of its parent star before the planet accretes a large amount of gas .",
    "both @xmath148 and @xmath149 are small in the inner regions ( eqs .",

    "[ fig : kh ] ) , while the timescale for the migration is much longer ( @xmath77@xmath78 years ) .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear if the gap opening can stop gas accretion completely .",
    "if disk gas is globally depleted when @xmath89 reaches @xmath64 , gas accretion onto the core can be limited by viscous diffusion of disk gas , not by the kelvin - helmholtz contraction of the envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that could be possible to account for the small amount of h / he .",
    "however , whether such a small amount of disk gas can bring the planet to the vicinity of the parent star should be examined .",
    "if it does not work , different migration mechanism such as gravitational scattering during orbital crossing of giant planets is required .      another way to explain the small amount of the h / he gas of hd149026b is loss of the envelope gas .",
    "there are three possibilities for loss of the envelope gas ; photoevaporation driven by incident uv flux from the parent star , the roche lobe overflow , and impact erosion by a collision with another gas giant planet .",
    "photoevaporation process for gas - rich planets is normally faster for smaller planetary masses , because less massive planets are more expanded and their envelope gas is more loosely bound @xcite .",
    "this means the envelope quickly disappears once the evaporation occurs , so that it should be relatively rare to observe a planet at a stage when a relatively small amount ( 3060 @xmath25 ) of envelope gas remains .",
    "however , this possibility is not excluded at present , because @xmath152-rich planets such as hd149026b can be more compact and their envelope gas is not necessarily more loosely bound ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "envelope gas can also be lost by the roche lobe overflow . when the roche lobe is filled with the envelope gas ,",
    "the gas overflows through the inner lagrangian point to the inner disk .",
    "the roche lobe overflow takes place if a planet is very close to its parent star because of inflation by stellar tidal heating as well as reduction of the roche lobe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and subsequent tidal inflation instability of the envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the spilled gas from the roche lobe first goes to the inner disk and is eventually going to fall on the parent star by the gravitational interaction with the planet . at the same time , the planet gains angular momentum as the counteraction and migrates outward . because of the increase in the orbital radius , the evaporation process slows down .",
    "thus a state of a 3060  @xmath25 envelope could be possible .",
    "this possibility is , however , in question because it is unclear if sufficient angular momentum is lost .",
    "@xcite suggested that collision between two giant planets could account for the internal structure of hd149026b . if cores with individual mass of @xmath153 are merged while significant amounts of their envelopes evaporate , a planet similar to hd149026b is formed .",
    "here we examine if significant loss of the envelope gas occurs through sph simulations of a collision between two giant planets .",
    "high impact velocity is expected .",
    "suppose that one giant planet orbits at 0.030.05  au and another giant planet in a highly eccentric orbit is sent from an outer region ( for the mechanism to send planets , see section [ sec : late_z_supply ] ) .",
    "since the impactor has high orbital eccentricity ( @xmath154 ) , collision velocity is similar to local keplerian velocity at 0.030.05  au around a @xmath155 star , 150190 km / s .",
    "this velocity is 23 times as high as the two - body surface escape velocity .",
    "since specific angular momentum of the impactor is given by @xmath156 , the impactor and the target have similar @xmath71 .",
    "hence , the semimajor axis of the merged planet would be similar to that of the target planet unless envelope evaporation changes specific angular momentum significantly .",
    "previous sph simulations of a collision between mars - size or earth - size rocky planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show almost no loss of material occurs by a low - velocity impact ( @xmath117 ) of @xmath157@xmath158 times as high as the two - body surface escape velocity ( @xmath118 ) defined by @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the planetary mass and radius and subscriptions t and i represent the target and the impactor . collisions with higher impact velocity",
    "lose larger amounts of material ; for example , 40% of the total mass is lost when @xmath162 in their simulations . for gas giant planets",
    ", we will have qualitatively similar results , but can expect more significant loss of envelope gas because the envelope is less tightly bound compared to rocky planets .    in order to simulate the collision between two gas giant planets , we use a sph method with the modified spline kernel function @xcite and artificial viscosity @xcite .",
    "our sph simulation code was checked to reproduce the results of @xcite for mars - size planets using the tillotson eos . in this paper , we assume that the gas giant planets are composed only of ideal gas with the adiabatic exponent of 2 ; this value reproduces the present structure of jupiter .",
    "we consider two hydrostatically equilibrated planets ( each being composed of about 30,000 sph particles ) with jupiter s mass and radius for initial conditions .",
    "we perform the simulations of head - on collisions with various impact velocities ( 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.25 , 2.5 , and 3.0@xmath118 ) . in our calculations",
    ", @xmath118 is 60 km / s .",
    "we calculate the gravitational force for each sph particle using the special - purpose computer for gravitational n - body systems , grape-6 .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the mass fraction lost by collisions with various impact velocities .",
    "higher impact velocity results in higher loss fraction .",
    "almost no escape occurs for a low - velocity impact ( @xmath163 ) . when the impact velocity is higher than @xmath164 , almost all sph particles ( @xmath26 90% ) are lost .",
    "although we are unable to know exactly the loss fraction of the core with our current simulation , we can estimated it approximately by tracking the motion of the sph particles which are initially located in inner part of the planet .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] also shows the loss fractions of the inner parts that are initially located inside 1/2 and 1/4 of the planetary radius . the inner part of the planet tends to remain in the merged planet .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath165 , about 50% of materials is totally lost , but almost no escape occurs for the material inside of 1/4 initial radius . a head - on collision of two gas giant planets with @xmath166@xmath164 possibly results in the considerable depletion of envelope and merging of core .",
    "the strongest point of this model for envelope loss is that we need no additional process to supply heavy elements to the planet .",
    "the collision increases @xmath111 up to @xmath167 as well as decreases @xmath168 ; as we showed in section [ sec : subcritical ] , it is possible to form cores of @xmath169 by ordinary planetesimal accretion in relatively massive disks , in particular , metal - rich disks .",
    "however , the numerical simulations performed here is still preliminary .",
    "since this mechanism may be promising , we should perform detailed simulations in the future .",
    "another possibility of formation of a metal - rich giant planet is the formation in a disk with originally high dust / gas ratio . in general ,",
    "dust grains migrate inward in a gas disk to change the local dust / gas ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the dust / gas ratio is enhanced in planet - forming regions at @xmath170  au , the metal - enriched envelope could be formed without any planetesimal / planet supply .",
    "the high dust / gas ratio also makes possible planetesimal formation from dust through self - gravitational instability against kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite and avoids type - i migration of terrestrial planets @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear if the dust / gas ratio can become large enough to account for @xmath111 of hd149026b .    in principle",
    ", it is possible for a @xmath108 core to form at @xmath171  au through accretion of many earth - size to uranian - size cores that migrate close to the parent star . in the vicinity of the parent star",
    ", gas accretion should be truncated at a relatively small mass ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : therm_condition ] ] ) . we may need to carry out n - body simulations of the migrating protoplanets in order to examine whether they can pass through resonant trapping ( or shepherding ) to merge or not .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that incorporation of type - i migration without any conditions causes severe inconsistency with observed data of extrasolar planets and our solar system .",
    "if we rely on type - i migration model , we need to clarify the condition for the occurrence of type - i migration at the same time .",
    "the high density of the close - in extrasolar giant planet hd149026b recently discovered by @xcite challenges theories of planet formation . in this paper , we have attempted to derive robust constraints on the planet s composition and infer possible routes to explain its formation .",
    "we have first simulated the evolution of hd149026b more extensively than previous workers @xcite and confirmed that the planet contains a substantial amount of heavy elements . preferred values of the total mass of heavy elements are 5080  @xmath25 ( section  [ sec : standard_model ] ) , which is consistent with the previous calculations .",
    "we showed that the results are unchanged for heavy elements located in the central core , or distributed inside the envelope , provided they remain deeper than the external radiative zone . in the event of a significant enrichment of the outer layers , slightly higher values of heavy elements content",
    "are possible ( section  [ sec : core_or_envelope ] ) . in order to derive minimum values of the mass of heavy elements ,",
    "we have explored the possibility that the planet was stored in a relatively cold environment for some time before migrating near to the planet .",
    "this strict minimum is @xmath172 , but is regarded as unlikely because it requires a late migration and no reheating of the planet by tidal circulization ( section  [ sec : cold_storage_hypothesis ] ) .",
    "we have then investigated the possibility of subcritical core accretion as envisioned for uranus and neptune to account for the small envelope mass as well as the large core mass . in principle a large core of 5080  @xmath25 can be formed by subcritical core accretion .",
    "however we have found it very unlikely for at least two reasons : ( i ) a subcritical core accretion results in a ratio of the core mass to the total mass above @xmath6 ( section  [ sec : critical_mass ] ) , whereas our evolution calculations showed such a high ratio to be possible in a very limited range of parameters ( see table  [ tab : constraints ] ) ; ( ii ) the subcritical formation of a 5080 @xmath25 core requires an extremely massive or metal - rich disk with dust surface density 30 - 50 times the values obtained for the minimum mass solar nebula ( section  [ sec : subcritical ] ) .",
    "a reasonably massive and/or metal - rich disk can form cores of at most @xmath153 far from the parent star .",
    "those facts require us to consider ( i ) the migration of the planet , ( ii ) the supply of heavy elements to the planet during or after the gas accretion phase , and ( iii ) a limited supply of disk gas or loss of the envelope gas to account for the properties of hd149026b .    in section  [ sec : z_supply ]",
    ", we have discussed how the heavy elements can be delivered to the planet during or after the gas accretion phase according to these scenarios .",
    "an efficient delivery during the gas accretion phase needs to be re - investigated in much more details , because the shepherding tends to prevent the planet from accreting planetesimals ( section  [ sec : concurrent_z_supply ] ) . on the other hand , scattering of planetesimals / planets by one or several outer giant planets",
    "was shown to lead to an efficient accretion by a close - in giant planet , and is a promising explanation for the formation of metal - rich planets ( section  [ sec : late_z_supply ] ) .",
    "the relatively small amount of hydrogen and helium present in hd149026b is also to be explained by the relatively slow formation of the planet in a low - density environment ( section  [ sec : limited_gas_supply ] ) .",
    "another possibility is related to erosion of the envelope during giant impacts .",
    "a reasonable impact velocity of 22.5 times the two - body surface escape velocity was found to result in a substantial loss of the envelope gas , while solid cores are probably merged ( section  [ sec : envelope_loss ] ) .      * a giant planet with a core of @xmath153 forms far from its parent star in a relatively massive and/or metal - rich disk .",
    "then it moves to the vicinity of the parent star through type - ii migration @xcite . in the outer regions",
    "additional more than three giant planets form , which may be likely in massive / metal - rich disks @xcite .",
    "they starts orbit crossing and the innermost one is temporally detached from the outer two .",
    "the perturbation from the outer two secularly pumps up the eccentricity of the innermost one @xcite .",
    "the associated secular decrease of its pericenter distance results in collision with the close - in planet .",
    "the impactor also has a core of @xmath153 .",
    "their solid cores are merged to form a core of @xmath167 , while envelope gas is severely eroded to @xmath173 .",
    "the orbital eccentricity of the merged body is damped by tidal interaction with the parent star . * a @xmath153 core forms in an evaporating disk that was originally massive and/or metal rich .",
    "the core thus becomes supercritical , but the accretion of the envelope is limited by viscous diffusion in an evolved , extended gaseous disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the planet subsequently accretes heavy elements through the delivery of planetesimals and/or planets , either because of migration due to interactions with the gas disk or to secular perturbations with a massive outer planet .    above two scenarios",
    "are different from each other in that the former leaves at least one outer giant planet while the latter does not necessarily need any outer giant planets .",
