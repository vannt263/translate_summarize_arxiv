    "neutrino oscillation induced by light neutrino masses and lepton mixings gives a plausible explanation for the results of the many neutrino experiments .",
    "in the three active neutrino framework , the neutrino mixing is given by , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the flavor index , @xmath3 is the mass - eigenstate index .",
    "the mixing matrix @xmath4 is a @xmath5 unitary matrix , called maki - nakagawa - sakata(mns ) matrix @xcite , defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for @xmath8 .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino anomaly @xcite strongly suggests @xmath9 oscillation with large mixing , @xmath10 and a larger mass squared difference , @xmath11 , which is almost confirmed by the k2k experiment @xcite and is expected to be reconfirmed in near future @xcite .",
    "the solar neutrino deficit @xcite is also explained by the oscillation of @xmath12 into another neutrino state .",
    "it gives several allowed regions for @xmath13 and the smaller mass squared difference @xmath14 among which the region for large mixing msw @xcite ( lmsw ) solution seems most preferable . to survey the lmsw region the kamland experiment @xcite will start soon .",
    "also the borexino experiment @xcite will strongly constrain the parameter region .",
    "however , we do not have sufficient information to determine the all mixing angles and the sign of the mass squared differences .",
    "@xmath15 is constrained strongly by chooz @xcite and palo verde @xcite experiments ; @xmath16 , but it has not determined yet .",
    "we also have no information about the sign of @xmath17 , and the cp phase @xmath18 .",
    "therefore there are many proposals for neutrino oscillation experiments to determine them .",
    "the future neutrino - oscillation experiments based on an accelerator , on both a conventional beam @xcite and a muon storage ring @xcite , are expected to give high precision tests of oscillation . indeed according to these studies",
    ", we will determine the mixing angles and mass squared differences very precisely .",
    "the parameters relevant with atmospheric neutrino anomaly will be determined with error of a few % . in these experiments",
    "we can explore very small value ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath20 and we have a chance to observe the cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "till today main concern on future neutrino oscillation experiments is how precisely we can determine the oscillation parameters .",
    "is it all we can do in such experiments ?",
    "the answer is no.@xcite in addition to the neutrino oscillation parameters we can probe the new lepton - flavor violating physics .",
    "it affects for example muon decay , matter effect and so on .",
    "furthermore , as we will see in this paper , the effect of these exotic couplings is enhanced in oscillation phenomena .",
    "even if the coupling is rather small , such new physics modifies the oscillation pattern distinguishably and hence it will be detectable .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility to measure the effect of new physics in future neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we first study how the new physics contribute to the neutrino oscillation phenomena in section ii .",
    "there we will see the reason why its effect is enhanced in the oscillation physics . in section iii",
    ", we embody the formalism and adopt it for a neutrino factory and an upgraded conventional beam .",
    "we present numerical results on the feasibility to search new interactions in section iv .",
    "we argue that the energy dependence of event rate at relatively high energy region is a key issue for a observation .",
    "we will discuss the relation between lepton flavor violating interaction and some models in section v. finally , a summary and discussion are given in section vi .",
    "in this section we reexamine what is measured in oscillation experiments and see how new physics gives contribution to the oscillation phenomena .",
    "though we discuss only a neutrino factory to make the argument concrete , same discussion is followed in oscillation experiments with a conventional beam .",
    "first we remind ourselves what is really measured in a neutrino factory .",
    "all we know is that the muons , say , with negative charge decay at an accumulate ring and wrong sign muons are observed in a detector located at a length @xmath21 away just after the time @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the light speed .",
    "this is depicted schematically in fig.[fig : weknow ] .",
    "since we know that there is the weak interaction process , we interpret such a wrong sign event as the evidence of the neutrino oscillation , @xmath24 , which is graphically represented in fig.[fig : weak ] .    now if there is a flavor - changing exotic interaction , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath25 then we will have the same signal of a wrong sign muon , whose diagram is shown in fig.[fig : same ] , just like that caused by the weak interaction and the neutrino oscillation .",
    "we can not distinguish these two kinds of contribution .",
    "the quantum mechanics tells us that in this case , to get a transition rate , we first sum up these amplitudes and then square the summation . therefore there is an interference phenomenon between several amplitudes in this process . through this interference",
    "we get an enhancement of the effect of new physics , that is , we can make oscillation - enhanced search for new interactions with neutrinos .",
    "the leading amplitude is expected to arise from well known physics .",
    "on the other hand the amplitudes @xmath47 is relatively small and may contain the contribution from new physics .",
    "however , even though @xmath48 is very small , it would be possible for the interference term to be large .",
    "thus even if the effect of new physics is not detectable due to systematic errors in a direct measurement , we may see the oscillation - enhanced effect of new physics .    in neutrino oscillation experiments ,",
    "the state @xmath33 consists of the state of the parent particle of neutrinos and @xmath35 consists from the state of the target particle that interacts with a neutrino in a detector .",
    "the final state @xmath49 corresponds to the state of the particle which can induce an identifiable event in a detector as a result of the interaction with the target particle ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "other final states @xmath30 denote the states of all unobserved particles , which appear at both the neutrino - creation process and the detection process .",
    "the intermediate state @xmath28 is interpreted as a neutrino state .",
    "the leading amplitude is given by the weak interaction and the neutrino oscillation , so the final state @xmath42 is produced through the weak interaction , and the intermediate state @xmath50 is a neutrino state which `` oscillates '' from a certain weak interaction eigenstate to same / another one . even if there is no oscillation ,",
    "different intermediate states @xmath51 induced by exotic interactions give non - vanishing amplitudes for the total `` oscillation '' process .",
    "the new physics would violate the flavor conservation and/or the standard chiral property .",
    "amplitudes which have all the same initial states @xmath52 and final states @xmath42 interfere with each other .",
    "it means that the leading amplitude from the weak interaction interferes with an exotic amplitude . in a neutrino - oscillation experiment",
    "such interference would give sub - leading contribution to the total probability . a large difference from the standard oscillation will be realized .",
    "to put the situation concretely , we consider a wrong - sign muon production process through the neutrino oscillation @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the initial state @xmath33 is @xmath54 and the observed final state @xmath49 is @xmath55 .",
    "the above consideration tells that we have to calculate the transition rate depicted in fig.[fig : true ] .",
    ". corresponds to fig.[fig : true ] : the correspondences for the other symbols are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . in this process , the new physics effects contribute to three parts ; the neutrino - creation process as mentioned above in eq . , the detection process , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath58 and the matter effect described as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the electron number density in matter .",
    "makes a shift on an observed @xmath61 experimentally . ] for anti - neutrinos such an exotic matter effect is given by @xmath62 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of the exotic matter effect is induced in the similar way to the standard matter effect .    by expanding fig.[fig :",
    "true ] , the transition probability of this process is illustrated in fig.[fig : expansion ] . in fig.[fig : expansion ] the first diagram on the first line describes the contribution from the weak interaction and the oscillation process , where the unobserved state @xmath42 corresponds to @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "it gives the leading amplitude .",
    "the other diagrams on the first line in fig.[fig : expansion ] represent the effects of new physics , in which the states of neutrinos before and/or after the oscillation differ from the weak interaction case in flavor and/or chiral property .",
    "since diagrams in the first line have completely the same final states @xmath49 and @xmath42 , they interfere with each other .",
    "the diagrams on the second and the third line in fig.[fig : expansion ] have different final states form those of the first line , so that there is no interference with the weak interaction and it is expected that their contributions to the transition rate is negligibly small .",
    "is given by the diagram of the first line in fig.[fig : expansion ] .",
    "figure [ fig : interference ] shows the eq . and",
    "eq .. the leading probability is proportional to @xmath66 since it is known that exotic effective interactions are so small according to the direct searches , that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "however , the effect of new physics gives @xmath69 and @xmath70 contribution to the signal of wrong sign muon due to the interference with the amplitude of the weak interaction .",
    "this fact makes the search for new physics possible in an oscillation - enhanced way .",
    "it gives relatively large effect . on the contrary ,",
    "even if the stored muon are very high intense , a direct detection of an exotic decay process will be very difficult due to systematics since the probabilities of such processes are proportional to the squares of the effective coupling constants and hence is expected too small to be detected .",
    "in this section we consider the neutrino oscillation in the presence of new physics more concretely to get the analytic expression for the transition rate . hereafter we consider only diagrams which interfere with that of the known physics , _",
    "i.e. _ , the weak interaction .",
    "first we note that the amplitude for `` neutrino oscillation '' can be divided into three pieces : ( 1 ) amplitude relevant with decay of a parent particle denoted as @xmath71 , here @xmath72 describes the type of interactions . for @xmath73 decay , as we will see in eq . and",
    ", there are two types of interactions , @xmath74 while for @xmath75 decay we do not need this label .",
    "@xmath2 distinguishes the particle species which easily propagates in the matter and make an interaction at a detector .",
    "( 2 ) amplitude representing a transition of these propagating particles , which are usually neutrinos , from one species @xmath2 to another / same @xmath76 , denoted as @xmath77 .",
    "( 3 ) amplitude responsible for producing a charged lepton @xmath78 from a propagated particle @xmath76 at a detector , stood for by @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath80 denotes an interaction type . using these notations we get the probability to observe a charged lepton @xmath81 at a detector as @xmath82",
    "therefore we can consider the effect of new physics separately for decay , propagation and detection processes .",
    "first we consider the decay process of parent particles .",
    "since all final states must be the same , for a neutrino factory , the exotic decays of muons which are @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be amplified by the interference .",
    "though in the presence of majorana mass terms neutrinos and anti neutrinos can mix with each other , this effect is strongly suppressed by @xmath85 .",
    "therefore we do not have to consider decays into neutrino with opposite chirality such as @xmath86 the former is relevant with @xmath87 and the latter is relevant with @xmath88 . in other words , we can approximate neutrinos to be massless except for the propagation process .",
    "this fact and lorentz invariance allow only two kinds of new interactions in this process . for a wrong - sign mode ,",
    "the allowed two interactions are the @xmath89 type , @xmath90 which has the same chiral property as the weak interaction but violates the flavor conservation , and the @xmath91 type , @xmath92 the latter has different chiral property from the former , so that it gives different energy dependence to the transition rate .",
    "these exotic interactions interfere with the leading amplitude and contribute as next leading effects .",
    "note that generally @xmath93 and @xmath94 are complex numbers.@xcite    in the case of the @xmath89 type exotic interaction , we can introduce the interference effect by treating the initial state of oscillating neutrino as the superposition of all flavor eigenstates . on the @xmath95 process",
    ", we can take initial neutrino @xmath96 as @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "this simple treatment is allowed only for the @xmath89 type interaction because of the same interaction form as the weak interaction except for difference of the coupling constant and the flavor of antineutrino . in this case",
    "we can generalize the initial neutrino for any flavor , using y. grossman s source state notation @xcite , as , is not necessarily unitary . ]",
    "@xmath99 we can include the total exotic effect into the oscillation probability as @xmath100 this treatment is also valid for the effect on the @xmath64 oscillation .",
    "in the case of the @xmath91 type exotic interaction , we can not treat interference terms simply . the interference term between the weak interaction and an exotic interaction eq .",
    "denoted as @xmath101 gives the rate for the observation of the wrong sign charged lepton , which is interpreted normally as the oscillation from @xmath102 in @xmath103 decay , as follows : @xmath104 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1+\\mathcal{p_\\mu}}{2 } \\frac{8 g_{f}}{\\pi}m_{e}m_{\\mu } e_\\nu ( |{\\mathbf p}_{\\mu}| -e_{\\mu } )   \\sum_{\\alpha\\beta\\beta ' i i ' }   { \\rm re } [ \\lambda_{\\alpha } '   t_{e\\beta}^{*}d^{i*}_{\\beta l^{+ } } t_{\\alpha\\beta ' } d_{\\beta ' l^{+}}^{i ' } ] , \\label{eq : cross - amp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the polarization of the initial @xmath103 , @xmath106 is @xmath107 energy , and @xmath108 is @xmath73 momentum ( energy ) .    in the case for the observation of the same sign charged lepton , which is interpreted as the oscillation from @xmath109 in @xmath103 decay , as follows : @xmath110 , \\label{eq : cross - amp - numu - forward}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath75 decay",
    "the situation is much simpler . in the presence of new physics",
    "there may be a flavor violating decay of @xmath75 such as @xmath111 .",
    "this effect changes the initial @xmath107 state ; @xmath112 in this case we do not have to worry about the type of new physics which gives a flavor changing @xmath75 decay at a low energy scale . due to kinematics ,",
    "the energy and the helicity of the decaying particles , @xmath73 and @xmath107 are fixed .",
    "next we consider the propagation process .",
    "exotic interactions also modify the hamiltonian for neutrino propagation as @xcite , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the ordinary matter effect given by @xmath115 , @xmath116 is the extra matter effect due to new physics interactions , that is defined by @xmath117 .",
    "note that to consider the magnitude of the matter effect , the type of the interaction is irrelevant since in matter particles are at rest and hence the dependence on the chirality is averaged out.@xcite    finally we make a comment about new physics which affect a detection process . to consider this process we need the similar treatment to that at the decay process , that is , we have to separate contribution of new interactions following the difference of the chirality dependence .",
    "however to take into account new physics at a detector , the parton distribution and a knowledge about hadronization are necessary . though we may wonder whether we can parameterize the effect of new physics at the detector @xmath118 as @xmath119 like @xmath120 . it is expected that @xmath119 has a complicated energy dependence due to the parton distribution for example in a energy region of a neutrino factory .",
    "consider the case that there is an elementary process from lepton flavor violating new physics including strange quark .",
    "to parameterize its effect we need both its magnitude and the distribution function of strange quark in nucleon which will show the dependence on the neutrino energy ( more exactly , the transfered momentum from neutrino to strange quark ) .",
    "they are beyond our ability and hence we do not consider them further in this paper , though new physics which can affect the decay process have contribution to the detection process too .",
    "let us discuss the feasibility to observe the signal induced by new physics .",
    "we will deal with both an upgraded conventional beam and a neutrino factory but present a little bit qualitatively different analysis in each experiment .    for a neutrino factory ,",
    "we use following procedures : first , we assume the magnitude of the effects caused by new interactions .",
    "next , we calculate the event numbers including the effects of new physics @xmath121 and also calculate that based on the standard model @xmath122 .",
    "then , we define the following quantity , so called @xmath123 function , distribution function with one degree of freedom .",
    "more detail on statistics is found in ref.@xcite . ]",
    "@xmath124 where @xmath3 is the energy bin index , @xmath125 is the muon number , and @xmath126 is the detector mass . to claim that new physics effects can be observed at 90% confidence level , it is required @xmath127 and this condition is rewritten as @xmath128 from the above method , we can obtain the necessary muon number and the detector mass to observe the new physics effects at 90% confidence level .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are some kinds of option on beam configurations for an upgraded conventional beam ; wide band , narrow band , off axis , and so on .",
    "we discuss the event number of _ no - oscillated neutrino events _ at the detector @xmath129 unlike the case for a neutrino factory .",
    "the concrete procedure is almost the same as that for a neutrino factory .",
    "we separate @xmath123 function defined in first line of eq . into two parts ; @xmath130 and get the necessary number of no - oscillated neutrino events from @xmath131 in the numerical calculation for a conventional beam , we consider the wide - band - beam like situation , whose flux distribution for energy is constant .      here , we deal with the case that there are only @xmath89 type new interactions in the lepton sector . in this case , we need to consider the effect represented in eqs . and .",
    "before making the presentation of the numerical calculations , we give the analytic expression for the sensitivities to understand the essential features . as we showed in section iii ,",
    "the interference terms between @xmath89 type interactions and the weak interaction have the same dependence on the @xmath73 polarization leading term does .",
    "it can not be expected that the sensitivity to such interference term becomes better by the control of the parent @xmath73 polarization .",
    "we consider here an unpolarized muon beam .",
    "the `` oscillation probability '' is given by eq .",
    "in this situation .",
    "more detailed calculations are presented in the appendix .",
    "the analytic expression of probability for @xmath133 given in the appendix a shows that the effect due to @xmath134 and @xmath135 are irrelevant since these terms are proportional to @xmath136 in the high energy region , so it is difficult to observe their effects .",
    "the flavor changing processes between muon and electron , _",
    "@xmath137 , @xmath138 conversion , are strictly constrained from experiments , and as we argue in the next section the box diagrams of the @xmath73-to-@xmath139 processes must relate to @xmath140 and @xmath141 . therefore , the magnitude of @xmath142 has very severe bound and the terms depending on it are also not effective . assuming some models , _",
    "e.g. _ , mssm with right - handed neutrinos , it is expected that the magnitude of @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the same order because they are produced by similar diagrams .",

    "that is , we have the effect of not @xmath253 but @xmath254 , where @xmath93 is an effective coupling of new physics , in an oscillation experiment .",
    "we understood also that the all particle states which appear as external lines including unobserved particles must be the same for the interference to occur .",
    "this statement means that not only the particle species but also their energy and helicity must be the same .",
    "we have to take into account both the particle species and a type of an interaction .    next we derived the transition rate for an appearance of a charged lepton , which is usually interpreted by the neutrino oscillation .",
    "to calculate the transition rate in a neutrino factory , we have to consider not only particle states in external lines but also a type of new physics .",
    "we separated the effects of new physics in three parts : ( 1 ) we considered new physics affecting the decay process of a parent particle . if new physics which affects the @xmath73 decay is a @xmath89 type , eq .",
    ", then it changes the initial state of neutrinos from a pure flavor eigenstate to a mixed state given by eq .. on the contrary , for the case of a @xmath91 type new interaction , eq . , we have a rather complicated equation for the transition rate , though this effect is suppressed by @xmath255 due to the difference of the chirality dependence on the interaction from that on the weak interaction . on the other hand , in an oscillation experiment with a conventional beam",
    ", we do not have to worry about the interaction type for the @xmath75 decay , since the energy and the helicity of mouns and neutrinos are fixed due to the kinematics of the two body decay .",
    "we can parameterize the effect of new physics using eq .. ( 2 ) we studied the effects of new physics in matter .",
    "they are parametrized as eq . for both oscillation experiments .",
    "their effects also appear linearly in @xmath256 and hence they can give significant modification on an `` oscillation event '' .",
    "( 3 ) we gave a comment how new physics appears at the detector .",
    "the essence is quite similar with that of the decay process of a parent particle .",
    "however , to parameterize the effect at the detector we need not only a magnitude of an elementary process giving a lepton flavor violation but also a parton distribution function which gives the dependence on the neutrino energy .",
    "we need a precise knowledge about nuclei so it is very difficult and we ignored these effects .",
    "then we calculate how many no - oscillation neutrinos are necessary to observe the effect of new physics considering only statistical fluctuation . for a neutrino factory we translated this neutrino number into the parent muon number .",
    "if we know all the mixing parameters exactly , then it will be very easy to observe an effect of new physics , which we parameterized as @xmath257 in eqs . and .",
    "the optimum setup for the baseline length and the energy region in a neutrino factory is easily understood by the high energy expansion of the transition rate as given in eq . and @xmath258 , eq . , for example .",
    "however , in general , we can not expect that we know the mixing parameters exactly . if the new physics effect gives a similar energy dependence for the transition rate with that of the weak interaction as eq .",
    ", we can not expect that this effect is observable eventually . on the contrary , if the energy dependence is different as eq .",
    ", we can expect , even if we have the uncertainties of the mixing parameters , the new physics effect makes a significant modification to the transition rate . in this case",
    "the uncertainties of the mixing parameters do not make the observability of the new physics effect worse . to survey the presence of @xmath257 , the use of the appearance channel of @xmath259 gives the best sensitivity .",
    "the sensitivities to new physics effect depend not only on their magnitudes but also their complex phases .",
    "more precisely we can observe an effect of a certain combination of the cp phase @xmath18 and these parameters as given in for example eq .. the sensitivities are proportional to @xmath201",
    ". naively we can expect their significant contribution as long as these combinations are larger than @xmath260 .",
    "finally , we gave a discussion about possible new physics and their consequences to the parameters @xmath257 .",
    "many models predict large lepton flavor violations to explain neutrino majorana masses .",
    "these violations also affect decays of particles .",
    "for example , in many models there will be a flavor changing @xmath73 decay .",
    "also these effects will appear in the matter effects and possibly at the detection processes .",
    "their effects must be taken into account in the analysis of oscillation experiments if we take those models seriously . among these effects",
    "@xmath261 changing effect is expected to be large to explain the large mixing in the atmospheric neutrino anomaly . to observe these effect the disappearance channel of @xmath262 channel are very effective .",
    "this @xmath263 changing effect may play an important role in @xmath179 appearance experiments like opera.@xcite    incidentally we briefly mention the result of the lsnd experiment.@xcite in general , its result is interpreted by the neutrino oscillation .",
    "if its result is partially confirmed by miniboone @xcite , namely , miniboone see a flavor changing signal with a small rate which is at the lower end of the lsnd result , then we may interpret the result by the flavor changing decay of @xmath75 and/or @xmath73 .",
    "if we take this interpretation , then the expected signal in a future neutrino - oscillation experiment is quite different from that by a four - generation model .",
    "we need to keep this possibility in mind .",
