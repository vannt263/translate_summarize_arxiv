    "in any map of the universe , there appear large regions that are avoided by galaxies .",
    "these regions may not be completely empty but , compared to the rest of the universe , are extremely underdense .",
    "we refer to these regions as voids .",
    "the giant void in botes was discovered more than twenty years ago ( kirshner et al . 1981 ) and the existence of voids was confirmed by subsequent larger surveys at a variety of wavelengths ( davis et al .",
    "1992 ; de lapparent , geller , & huchra 1986 ; da costa et al . 1988 ; geller & huchra 1989 ; maurogordato et al .",

    "; see rood 1998 and references therein for a discussion of the history of void detection and interpretation ) .",
    "the size of the largest voids ( @xmath15mpc ) in these earlier surveys was of the same order as the characteristic depth of the surveys , which allowed speculation that even larger such structures might be found .",
    "deeper redshift surveys , for example , the las campanas redshift survey ( shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) , confirmed the ubiquity of these structures , but did not detect larger voids .",
    "the recently - completed 2dfgrs ( colless et al . 2003 ) and the ongoing sloan digital sky survey ( abazajian et al .",
    "2003 ) have the depth , areal coverage , and complete sampling of the galaxy distribution necessary to more precisely quantify the distribution of voids .    the observed spatial distribution of voids and the properties of the few galaxies that lie within them ( rojas et al .",
    "2003a , b ) can strongly constrain models for cosmology and galaxy formation .",
    "peebles ( 2001 ) discusses an apparent discrepancy between the cold dark matter model and observations . in cdm",
    ", voids should be filled with dwarf halos with escape velocities just larger than the @xmath16 or so needed to bind photoionized baryons ( dekel & silk 1986 ; hoffman , silk , & wyse 1992 ) .",
    "however , surveys of dwarf galaxies indicate that they trace the same structure as that of other galaxies ( bingelli 1989 ) . pointed",
    "observations toward voids also fail to find a significant population of faint galaxies ( lindner et al .",
    "1996 ; kuhn , hopp , & elssser 1997 ; popescu , hopp , & elssser 1997 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the widely - observed result that galaxies have common voids , regardless of hubble type ( e.g. , thuan et al .",
    "1987 ; babul & postman 1990 ; mo , mcgaugh , & bothun 1994 ) . the failure of cdm models to accurately predict the paucity of dwarfs in voids is connected to the overprediction of small satellites that would be observed in milky - way sized halos ( kauffmann et al . 1993 ; klypin et al . 1999",
    "; moore et al .",
    "the luminosity function of void galaxies indicates that voids are not filled with a dense population of void galaxies ( hoyle et al .",
    "semi - analytic modeling of galaxy formation , including feedback effects , predict that galaxies in voids should be somewhat fainter , bluer , and more disk - like than galaxies in denser environments ( benson et al . 2003 ) . testing these predictions requires identification of large samples of void galaxies , which in turn requires detection of many large voids .    to test cosmological models ,",
    "two complementary approaches may be used to describe the distribution of voids : detection of voids , i.e. , treating them as individual structures and studying their properties , and characterization of large - scale structure using a variety of void statistics .",
    "a number of techniques have been developed for detecting voids , including kauffmann & fairall ( 1991 ) , kauffmann & melott ( 1992 ) , ryden ( 1995 ) , ryden & melott ( 1996 ) , el - ad & piran ( 1997 , ep97 ) , and aikio & mhnen ( 1998 ) .",
    "these algorithms have been applied to a number of galaxy surveys ( slezak , de lapparent & bijaoui 1993 ; pellegrini , da costa & de carvalho 1989 ; el - ad , piran & da costa 1996 ; el - ad , piran and da costa 1997 ; mller et al .",

    "the numbers of voids in each sample varies , depending on the definition of a void , but the void samples in these studies each contained fewer than 10@xmath0 voids . in this paper",
    "we describe detection of more than 200 voids in the 2dfgrs .    the distribution of voids may also be characterized using statistics such as the void probability function ( vpf , white 1979 ) and the underdensity probability function ( upf , vogeley et al . 1989 ) , which depend on the hierarchy of n - point correlation functions .",
    "the vpf is simply the probability that a randomly selected volume contains no galaxies .",
    "the upf measures the frequency of regions with density contrast @xmath17 below a threshold .",
    "these statistics reveal statistical information about the void population but do not give details on specific voids .",
    "halo - occupation models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , berlind & weinberg 2002 ) show that statistics of voids can strongly constrain models for galaxy biasing models .",
    "previous work on the vpf includes examination of the sky - projected galaxy distribution ( sharp 1981 ; bouchet & lachize - rey 1986 ) , galaxy redshift surveys ( hamilton , saslaw , & thuan 1985 ; maurogordato & lachize - rey 1987 , 1991 ; fry et al .",

    "void statistics measured for the cfa2 survey and simulations of cdm models indicate that the models can reproduce voids of bright galaxies , but fail to match the statistics of fainter galaxies ( vogeley et al .",
    "1994 ; cen & ostriker 1998 ; benson et al .",
    "these statistics show that voids in the simulations can actually appear too empty .",
    "this result strongly conflicts with the visual impression that observed voids have very smooth edges , while structures in mock redshift surveys from simulations are more diffuse ( e.g. , diaferio et al .",
    "the large difference between voids in the dark matter and galaxy distributions ( ostriker et al .",
    "2003 ) strongly suggests that the inconsistency lies in the details of treating galaxy formation in voids .",
    "results of high - resolution hydrodynamic / n - body simulations show strong density dependence of the efficiency of galaxy formation ( blanton et al .",
    "1999 ; ostriker et al .",
    "precise measurement of the frequency of voids in samples of varying luminosity and type will yield strong tests of the details of galaxy formation models .    in this paper",

    "this survey contains @xmath18 galaxies over 1,500 deg@xmath0 .",
    "we describe the data in more detail in section [ sec : survey ] . in section [ sec : algo ] , we give an overview of the voidfinder algorithm , present the results in section [ sec : res ] . in section [ sec : vpf ] we turn our attention to the vpf and upf , give a brief outline of these algorithms and present our results on the vpf and upf statistics . in section [ sec : conc ]",

    "the 2dfgrs is an optical spectroscopic survey of objects brighter than b@xmath1919.30 selected from the apm galaxy survey ( maddox et al .",
    "1990a , b ) .",
    "the effective median magnitude limit of the survey is 19.30 , lowered from the original magnitude limit of b@xmath2019.45 because the photometry of the input catalog and the dust extinction maps have been revised so there are small variations in the magnitude limit as a function of position over the sky ( colless et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the 2dfgrs survey is divided into two main regions , with additional random fields observed to improve the angular coverage for statistics such as the power spectrum . for this analysis",
    ", we do not use the random fields as we can only find voids in regions that have a wide angular range .",
    "the two areas of interest are the south galactic pole ( sgp ) region , which covers the region @xmath21 , @xmath22 and a region which lies toward ( but not terribly close to ) the north galactic pole ( ngp ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the data that we analyze are from the public release that was distributed to the community in july 2003 ( colless et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "245,591 galaxy redshifts were contained in the data release , making this the largest completed redshift survey to date .",
    "the completeness of the survey varies with position on the sky because of unobserved fields ( mostly around the survey edges ) , observed objects with poor spectra , and objects that could not be observed due to either fiber collision constraints or broken fibers . to match the angular selection function in the construction of the random catalogs , required in our void finding algorithm , we use the software developed by the 2dfgrs team and distributed as part of the data release . for any given coordinates ( @xmath25 ) , the expected probability of a galaxy being contained in the 2dfgrs survey region",
    "is returned .",
    "we construct volume - limiteds sample from the 2dfgrs to obtain a uniform radial selection function , thus the only variation in the space density of galaxies with radial distance is due to clustering .",
    "this means the chance of finding a void at any given distance in such a sample should depend only on the local clustering rather than on the changing selection function .",
    "we adopt the global @xmath26-correction + evolution correction found for b@xmath27 selected galaxies in the eso slice project ( zucca et al .",
    "1997 ) and adopted by the 2dfgrs team ( norberg et al .",
    "2001 ) and use @xmath28 for voidfinding , we select a volume limit of @xmath29=0.138 .",
    "this value maintains the maximum number of galaxies in the sample : 27,573 galaxies in the ngp region and 33,581 galaxies in the sgp region .",
    "we adopt a @xmath30 cosmology when converting redshift into comoving distances . for this cosmology ,",
    "a redshift limit of @xmath29=0.138 corresponds to a comoving distance of 398@xmath2mpc . for measuring void statistics ,",
    "we examine sub - samples with a range of absolute - magnitude limits .",
    "the void finding algorithm we adopt is described in full detail in hv02 , including justification of each parameter value .",
    "the method is similar to that of ep97 .",
    "the steps of the void finding algorithm are as follows :    * classification of galaxies as wall or void galaxies * detecting empty cells in the distribution of wall galaxies * growth of the maximal empty spheres * classification of the unique voids * enhancement of the void volume    following hv03 , we calculate the mean distance , _ d _ , to the @xmath31 nearest galaxy .",
    "any galaxy that has less than three neighbors in a sphere of radius _ l@xmath32 _",
    "= 5.6@xmath2mpc is considered a void galaxy .",
    "the remaining galaxies are labeled as wall galaxies .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath33 is similar to the value used in rojas et al .",
    "( 2003a ) to identify void galaxies in the sdss .",
    "the next step is to place the wall galaxies onto a three dimensional grid .",
    "each empty grid cell is considered to be part of a possible void .",
    "our method finds the maximal sphere ( hole ) that can be drawn in the void starting from the empty cell .",
    "we insist that the holes lie completely in the survey . at this stage",
    "we keep track of all the holes with radii larger than the value of the search radius used to classify void and wall galaxies , @xmath34 .",
    "the fineness of the grid defines the minimum size void that can be detected .",
    "all holes with size larger than r = @xmath35l@xmath36 , where l@xmath36 is the size of each grid cell , will be detected .",
    "we use a cubical mesh that has 128 grid cells on a side , each of which is 4.7h@xmath37mpc in length , thus we find all holes larger than 8.1@xmath2mpc .    finding the holes is a robust process .",
    "deciding which of those holes are unique voids requires more thought .",
    "first we sort the holes by radius , the largest first .",
    "the largest hole found is automatically a void .",
    "we examine whether the second largest hole overlaps the void of not .",
    "if it overlaps by more than 10% in volume we say this hole is part of the first void , if not then it forms a new void .",
    "we continue like this for all holes with radii larger than 10@xmath2mpc .",
    "however , if a hole overlaps more than one previously detected void by more than 10% , the hole is ignored as it links together two larger , previously identified voids .",
    "we next enhance the volume of each void . any hole that overlaps the maximal void sphere by 50% of the smaller hole s volume",
    "is considered part of the larger void .",
    "if the hole overlaps with more than one void then it is not added to either of the voids as this again would link two voids together that we wish to keep separate .",
    "if the hole is isolated and less than 10@xmath2mpc in radius , it can not be classified as a separate void as we only call a hole a void if it is larger than 10@xmath2mpc in radius .",
    "finally we count the number of galaxies that lie within each void to determine the underdensity of the void .",
    "measured properties of each void include the coordinates of its center , the maximal sphere radius , the effective radius , and the average underdensity .",
    "we apply the voidfinder algorithm to volume - limited samples of the 2dfgrs and find 116 voids in the ngp region and 173 voids in the sgp region .",
    "the properties of all the voids are available upon request and are summarized in table [ tab : voidprops ] .",
    "figure [ fig : voidspic ] shows an example of the distribution of wall galaxies and the centers of voids in thin ( @xmath38 ) slices of the ngp and sgp .",
    "the filled circles show the location of the wall galaxies , the open triangles mark the centers of the voids .",
    "the sgp region covers an area that is approximately 33% larger than the ngp but it contains @xmath39 more voids . in this section",
    "we examine these voids in detail and compare the results for the ngp and sgp regions .      to assess the statistical significance of the detected voids , we generate 10 poisson samples of the 2dfgrs that have the same angular selection function , distant limits , and number density as the 2dfgrs but contain no clustering .",
    "the statistical significance of a void may be estimated from ( el - ad , piran & da costa 1997 ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the numbers of voids detected by applying voidfinder to random samples and galaxy samples , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : voidsig ] , we show the number of voids with radius greater than @xmath43 that we find in the ngp and sgp added together ( triangles ) as compared to the random catalogs ( squares ) . in the same plot",
    ", we present the significance of the voids .",
    "voids larger than 10@xmath2mpc are significant at the @xmath44% level , consistent with results in hv02 .",
    "the statistical significance of voids rapidly approaches 100% as the void radii increase ; the false positive rate for voids with average radius @xmath45mpc is well below 1% ."
