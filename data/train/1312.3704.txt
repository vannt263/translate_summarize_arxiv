    "estimates of dispersion measure ( dm ) using the frequency - dependent arrival time of pulses from pulsars have provided some of the most useful constraints on ionized gas in the interstellar medium of the milky way galaxy @xcite and in the galactic halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these estimates provide a direct measurement of the electron column density to each source , @xmath0 .",
    "they are independent of clumping factors , gas temperatures , and ( in some wavebands ) extinction , in contrast to emission - based probes of ionized gas .",
    "they are also independent of the metallicity and ionization state , unlike absorption line tracers .",
    "it would be extremely useful to have a similar electron column density probe for the intergalactic medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , pulsars are intrinsically faint and the most distant ones observed thus far are in the magellanic clouds ; for the foreseeable future , pulsar - based dms are unmeasureable at cosmological distances .",
    "two recent developments have renewed interest in dispersion measure as a cosmological probe .",
    "one has been the discovery of radio transients with durations of order milliseconds or less with a frequency - dependent arrival time consistent with plasma dispersion ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "these transients implied dm is far greater than that expected from the milky way and is consistent with an origin at cosmological distances ( @xmath1 of order unity ) .",
    "however , a terrestrial origin has not been excluded ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the other major development  and the subject of this paper  is the suggestion that dm could be measured in a _ continuous _ rather than pulsed source @xcite .",
    "if correct , then dispersion measures could be obtained using radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) as backlights , opening a completely new window on the study of intergalactic gas .",
    "there are two recently proposed schemes for measuring the dm to a continuous synchrotron source .",
    "one uses the 2-point correlation function of the electric field between two neighbouring frequency channels .",
    "the idea is that in the presence of dispersion , these channels cross - correlation should peak at a nonzero lag , with the signal arriving first in the higher - frequency channel @xcite .",
    "the other scheme is to use the 2-point correlation function of intensity fluctuations ( which is a 4-point correlation function of the received electric field ) .",
    "it relies on the intuition that since dispersion within a frequency channel smears out the received synchrotron pulse from each electron , the timescale at which the intensity fluctuates should be increased relative to the dm@xmath2 case , where the correlation time is roughly the inverse of the bandwidth , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this paper shows that no scheme for measuring the dm to a time - steady incoherent radio source can work .",
    "the conceptual basis for this result is that the 2-point correlation function of the electric field contains no phase information and , hence , is insensitive to the phase shift that is produced by dispersion . while the non - gaussian ( or connected ) part of higher - order statistics , such as the 3- and 4-point correlation functions , are indeed sensitive to dispersion measure , we show that the non - gaussian part is undetectable for any potential incoherent source .",
    "this is a consequence of the the central limit theorem : the number of electrons contributing to a source s flux at any time is large and , hence , the signal is very gaussian .",
    "there are exceptions to this argument : ( 1 ) the relative phase of both polarizations is observable in the 2-point correlation function ( which is why rotation measure is measurable ) , and ( 2 ) the relative phase of the received wavefront is altered both spatially or temporally by density gradients along the sightline ( yielding scintillations ) .",
    "however , neither of these loopholes is relevant to the determination of the dispersion measure , which is polarization - independent , does not vary with observer position over accessible baselines , and does not produce amplitude fluctuations .",
    "this paper will also explain why the proposed observables in @xcite and @xcite do not depend on dm , despite it seeming plausible that they would .",
    "in the case of the former observable ( the 2-point correlation function between adjacent bandpasses ) , in addition to the effect discussed in @xcite where an electronic pulse arrives earlier in the higher band , dispersion also distorts the pulse shape .",
    "we show that this distortion correlates the beginning of the lower - frequency signal with the end of the higher - frequency signal , exactly canceling the impact of the delay on observed correlations . in the case of the latter observable ( the temporal correlation of intensity fluctuations , or the 4-point correlation function of the electric field ) , for dispersed electron pulses , some electrons contribute correlated fluctuations in the intensity at unequal times  i.e. they contribute positively to @xmath4  but some electrons contribute anti - correlated fluctuations .",
    "the net result is that the intensity fluctuations decorrelate on timescales longer than @xmath3 even if the pulse from each electron is dispersed into a train whose temporal length is many times longer .",
    "the only part of the intensity correlation function that does not decorrelate on timescales longer than @xmath5 is the connected part , where all 4 electric fields are contributed by the same electron ; we show that this connected part is suppressed by a factor of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of electrons that contribute to the observed electric field at any given time . for any realistic agn",
    "this is negligible .",
    "recently , @xcite claimed that the suppression is only by a factor of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the photon occupation number seen by the observer .",
    "this would correspond to a quantum correction to the correlation function since it is proportional to planck s constant : @xmath10 .",
    "we show that quantum corrections do not enable one to measure the dm ; the basic reason is that for near - classical sources , quantum intensity fluctuations ( photon poisson noise ) are a feature of the uncertainty principle and its impact on the measurement process , and dispersion acts on the underlying wave function before the measurement is made .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec :",
    "stat - e ] , we develop the formalism for correlation functions of the electric field received at a detector after processing through an arbitrary linear filter .",
    "we use this to prove in  [ sec : stat - c ] that the 2-point correlation function of the received electric field contains no information about the dispersion measure , regardless of the filters applied and which signal channels are correlated . in  [ sec : ex ] , the procedure suggested by @xcite is studied in detail as a special case .",
    "intensity fluctuations are considered in  [ sec : int - fluct ] , where we show that the component that depends on dispersion is completely undetectable .",
    "we further discuss the calculation in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of masers as a source for dm measurements is briefly considered in  [ sec : maser ] .",

    "consider an optically thin incoherent synchrotron source .",
    "the notation here parallels that of @xcite .",
    "index notation will be used as follows : capital roman alphabet @xmath11 denote signal channels ( i.e. filtered electric fields in the chosen polarization state and filtered to the frequency band ) ; lower case roman indices @xmath12 denote pulses from relativistic electrons in the source ( the observed signal is the sum of the electric field from each such pulse ) ; and greek indices @xmath13 denote polarization states .",

    "is given by @xmath17 where the summation is over the pulse from each relativistic electron that contributes to the emission , @xmath18 is a normalization of the source strength , @xmath19 is the pulse profile , and @xmath20 is the time of the @xmath21 pulse .",
    "the rate of pulses is @xmath22 and has units of s@xmath23 ; the pulses are assumed independent so the number in any time interval @xmath24 is poisson - distributed with mean @xmath25 .",
    "( 1 ) of @xcite is similar except that the treatment here keeps the polarization index and the finite width of the pulse ( i.e. it is taken as some function @xmath26 rather than a dirac @xmath27-function ) .",
    "this makes the treatment here more general , but neither of these details is important to the final result .    in coming to the earth , the signal passes through an ionized cloud of some dispersion measure dm , which introduces a phase delay given by @xmath28 .",

    "[ eq : efilt.1 ] ) in the same sense that a complex phasor is used to describe a real oscillatory function .",
    "this paper is concerned with time - steady radio sources and , hence , we are interested in correlation functions of @xmath51 .",

    "it vanishes trivially so long as the filter @xmath32 excludes the dc component , i.e. so long as @xmath39 .",
    "thus , only 2-point and higher correlation functions are of interest .",
    "the 2-point correlation function is @xmath54 where the average is taken over both the types of electron pulses ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) and the pulse times ( @xmath20 ) of each pulse . in principle one may define the 2-point correlation function without the complex conjugate : @xmath57 but this is zero because @xmath51 and @xmath58 are both positive - frequency functions ( their fourier transforms are zero at @xmath59 ) .",
    "hence , their product is also positive - frequency , and its integral over a sufficiently long period of time is zero .",
    "higher - order correlation functions may be defined analogously and some have a simple physical interpretation .",
    "for example , the correlation function of intensity fluctuations is a 4-point correlation function of the electric field , since the intensity is proportional to the square of the electric field .",
    "we note that all the statistical properties of the radiation are encoded in @xmath60-point functions of the field .",

    "i.e. those computed in the preceding sections .",

    "a coherent state , or displaced vacuum state , is a right eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath376 with eigenvalue @xmath375 ( and _ not _ a right eigenstate of @xmath377 with eigenvalue @xmath378 ) .",
    "it is for this reason that the optical equivalence theorem for coherent states applies to normal - ordered correlation functions : e.g. @xmath379 and @xmath380 .",
    "the variance of the photon occupation number is given by @xmath381\\hat a \\rangle = \\bar n_\\gamma;\\ ] ] this is in fact the poisson noise term , and it arose entirely from operator - ordering considerations ( the square of the photon number operator @xmath382 is not normal - ordered ) .",
    "since the phase delay due to dispersion applies to the coherent state amplitudes , and not directly to numbers of photons , this added poisson noise is not dispersed .",
    "to frame this discussion in the context of a full statistical distribution , the number of photons in that mode is poisson - distributed with mean @xmath383 ; in a statistical mixture of such states where @xmath375 is complex gaussian distributed with zero mean and variance @xmath9 , then the occupation number is bose - einstein distributed , with mean @xmath9 and variance @xmath384 ( here @xmath385 is the classical variance , and @xmath9 is the additional contribution from poisson noise ) .",
    "this is a good model for the photon density matrix in a single mode of the electromagnetic field in the limit of a large number of emitting electrons @xmath7 , since then the central limit theorem will force the amplitudes @xmath375 to have a gaussian distribution .",
    "it is to this underlying semiclassical gaussian field that the machinery in the previous sections should be applied .",
    "the previous sections showed that dispersion is undetectable for incoherent sources of radiation because the radiation is highly gaussian .",
    "a class of extragalactic sources exist where the emission is stimulated and potentially less gaussian : the 1.6ghz oh and 22ghz h@xmath386o `` mega - masers '' .",
    "astrophysical masers do not have a well - defined cavity like a laboratory laser .",
    "instead , maser radiation is broadband in nature , without the phase coherence of a laboratory laser .",
    "still , maser radiation may exhibit correlations between non - equal frequencies and hence non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "saturation of the population inversion and as a result in the growth of the electric field occurs first in modes that have higher than average amplitudes .",
    "it acts to reduce the variance of the intensity , @xmath387 , relative to the gaussian expectation .",
    "simple one - dimensional calculations with parameters motivated by galactic masers find a connected contribution to @xmath388 that is @xmath389 the disconnected part at line center @xcite , although there are many effects that may reduce the connected term relative to these predictions .",
    "this level of non - gaussianity is comparable to the observational limit on the connected part of @xmath390 in galactic oh masers @xcite .",
    "however , the connected contribution to @xmath391 in a maser owes its existence to correlations between modes separated by on the order of the homogeneous line width of the masing molecules , @xmath392 @xcite . in order for plasma dispersion to have a significant impact on the received @xmath393",
    ", we require @xmath394 . taking parameters appropriate for oh masers at @xmath395 , we find @xmath396 assuming dm@xmath397pc@xmath100@xmath101 , and even smaller values result for h@xmath386o masers .",
    "therefore , the connected part of maser emission is not significantly altered by dispersion .",
    "the measurement of a dispersion measure to a cosmological radio source would open up a new window on the study of intergalactic baryons .",
    "since all confirmed cosmological radio sources are constant over timescales much larger than those affected by dispersion , the temporal delay in the arrival of different frequencies can not be used to measure dispersion unlike for galactic pulsars .",
    "however , recently several schemes have been proposed to measure the dispersion to such continuous sources using ( 1 ) the 2-point correlation function of the electric field , i.e. the delay of a lower - frequency channel relative to a higher - frequency channel @xcite ; ( 2 ) the 2-point correlation function of intensity fluctuations , which should have a longer timescale due to the spreading of arrival time within a given frequency channel @xcite ; and ( 3 ) the quantum corrections to the intensity fluctuations , i.e. dispersion of the poisson noise fluctuations in the source intensity @xcite .",
    "our analysis has shown that , due to various subtleties , none of these methods work .",
    "indeed , under very general assumptions , the observed signal from a continuous point source has no information beyond the 2-point correlation function of the electric field ( which evaluated at zero lag yields the intensity and polarization stokes parameters ) .",
    "this result is a consequence of the central limit theorem and the large number of incoherently emitting electrons contributing to the observed waveform for any astrophysical source .",
    "the possibility of measuring cosmological dispersion measures remains enticing , but will only be possible using sources that are time - variable or coherent ( and hence potentially non - gaussian ) .",
    "masers are coherent , but for typical parameters the dispersion across their very narrow line widths is too small . thus , given the calculations presented herein , the availability of dm measurements as a probe of the intergalactic medium remains contingent on the cosmological interpretation of the fast radio bursts @xcite or the existence of some similar class of fast radio transients .",
