    "the schwarzschild spacetime can be described analytically in many different coordinate systems .",
    "in addition to the original schwarzschild coordinates @xcite , well - known coordinate systems include kruskal - szekeres coordinates @xcite , eddington - finkelstein @xcite ( or kerr - schild @xcite ) coordinates , harmonic ( or de donder ) coordinates @xcite as well as painlev - gullstrand coordinates @xcite .",
    "another example is a one - parameter family of analytical coordinate systems that has both eddington - finkelstein and painlev - gullstrand coordinates as members @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this short paper",
    "we present another family of analytical coordinate systems representing the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we believe that this family has some remarkable properties : the coordinates extend smoothly through the black hole event horizon , the spatial coordinates are isotropic ( so that the spatial metric can be written as a conformal factor to some power times a flat spatial metric ) , and , for almost all members of the family , the spatial slices take a so - called _ trumpet _ geometry .",
    "moreover , all expressions are surprisingly simple , particularly for one special member of the family .    trumpet slices , meaning spatial slices of constant coordinate time that feature a trumpet geometry , have played an important role in numerical relativity , since they help numerical simulations avoid the spacetime singularities at the centers of black holes ( see , e.g. , @xcite for discussions ) .",
    "a trumpet slice ends on a sphere of non - zero ( and finite ) areal radius .",
    "the proper distance between this sphere and any point away from the sphere , measured on a slice of constant coordinate time , is infinite .",
    "represented in an embedding diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , or fig .  2 in @xcite ) , the slice therefore appears to approach a cylinder .",
    "the resulting shape has given the trumpet geometry its name .",
    "represented in a penrose diagram , trumpet slices connect spatial infinity in one universe with future timelike infinity in the other universe ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] below ) .",
    "member of our family of solutions with @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the distance from the axis of symmetry measures the areal radius @xmath6 .",
    "the circle near the top of the figure marks the event horizon at @xmath7.,width=288 ]    in numerical relativity simulations , trumpet slices emerge as a result of the imposed slicing condition .",
    "in particular , the so - called 1+log slicing @xcite leads , at late times , to  stationary 1+log \" trumpet slices @xcite . a ",
    "non - advective \" version of the 1+log slicing leads to maximally sliced trumpet slices @xcite .",
    "while the latter can be expressed analytically , albeit only in parametric form @xcite , it does not appear to be possible to express the former completely analytically .",
    "here we present a completely analytical family of trumpet slices .",
    "the family is parameterized by the areal radius of the trumpet , @xmath1 , and takes a particularly simple form for @xmath8 . at the other limit of the family , @xmath9",
    ", we recover painlev - gullstrand coordinates , for which the trumpet geometry disappears .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sol ] we present the family of solutions .",
    "we follow this with a derivation of the family in section [ deriv ] . in section [ numrel ]",
    "we discuss our solutions from the perspective of numerical relativity .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary in section [ sum ] .",
    "consider the line element @xmath10 here we have used spherical polar coordinates with an isotropic radius @xmath11 , we have abbreviated @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath1 are constants .",
    "it can be verified that the line element ( [ lineel ] ) satisfies einstein s equations in vacuum , but we will also derive this form of the metric from the schwarzschild solution below . in the following",
    "we restrict our analysis to @xmath14 so that @xmath15 remains real for all @xmath16 .    computing the proper area of a sphere centered on the origin",
    "we see that the areal radius @xmath6 is related to the isotropic radius @xmath11 by the simple relation @xmath17 in particular , this implies that the point @xmath18 corresponds to a sphere of areal radius @xmath1 .",
    "we also see that , for positive @xmath1 , the proper distance from @xmath18 to any point @xmath19 ( at constant coordinate time @xmath0 ) is infinite .",
    "together , these two properties establish the spatial geometry of the line element ( [ lineel ] ) as a trumpet geometry .",
    "an embedding diagram of this geometry is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "[ fig2 ]     member of the family of solutions ( [ lineel ] ) .",
    "short dashes mark the singularity at @xmath20 , long dashes mark the limiting surface at @xmath21 , and dots mark more general curves of constant areal radius @xmath6 .",
    "solid curves ( red online ) mark @xmath4 trumpet slices which connect spatial infinity to future timeline infinity . for comparison , the solid horizontal line ( green online ) in the penrose diagram marks a wormhole slice . finally , the solid diagonal lines mark the event horizon . ]",

    "solid curves ( red online ) mark @xmath4 trumpet slices which connect spatial infinity to future timeline infinity . for comparison , the solid horizontal line ( green online ) in the penrose diagram marks a wormhole slice . finally , the solid diagonal lines mark the event horizon . ]",
    "particular values of @xmath22 result in very simple solutions . letting @xmath23",
    ", we see that @xmath24 , and the line element ( [ lineel ] ) reduces to @xmath25 the relation ( [ areal_isotropic ] ) now becomes @xmath26 , which is the same relation as for harmonic ( or de donder ) coordinates @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows kruskal and penrose diagrams for this solution .",
    "if we choose @xmath3 instead , the line element ( [ lineel ] ) becomes @xmath27 which is well known as the painlev - gullstrand line element .",
    "a straightforward derivation of the line element ( [ lineel ] ) starts with the schwarzschild solution in schwarzschild coordinates , @xmath28 here @xmath29 , and @xmath13 is the black hole s gravitational mass .",
    "we then introduce a height function @xmath30 that transforms the schwarzschild time @xmath31 to a new time coordinate @xmath32 in terms of this new time coordinate the line element takes the form @xmath33 we seek transformations that bring the spatial part of the line element into isotropic form , meaning that we can write this spatial part as some overall factor times the flat metric . following convention we express the overall factor as the fourth power of a conformal factor @xmath34 and identify @xmath35 where @xmath11 is again an isotropic radius . from the angular part of this identification",
    "we obtain @xmath36 while the radial part yields @xmath37 here we interpret @xmath38 as a function of @xmath11 , and abbreviate @xmath39 .",
    "finally , in order to obtain trumpet solutions , we look for solutions for which the conformal factor scales with @xmath40 for small @xmath11 .",
    "a surprisingly simple solution of this form results from the choice @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "we then see that @xmath43 which , for small @xmath11 , diverges with @xmath40 as desired . substituting equation ( [ defrr ] ) into ( [ finddhdr ] ) yields @xmath44 ; inserting this into ( [ schwarzschildleh ] ) and expressing @xmath45 in terms of @xmath11 then results in the line element ( [ lineel ] ) and completes the derivation .",
    "since trumpet slices play a special role in numerical relativity , it is of interest to express the line element ( [ lineel ] ) in terms of a @xmath46 decomposition ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a textbook treatment ) . comparing the line element ( [ lineel ] ) with the 3 + 1 form @xmath47 we can identify the lapse function @xmath48 , the radial component of the shift vector @xmath49 , and the spatial metric @xmath50 as @xmath51 here the conformal factor @xmath34 is given by ( [ findpsieval ] ) , @xmath52 is the flat metric in spherical polar coordinates , and the non - radial components of the shift vanish . for time - independent solutions ,",
    "the extrinsic curvature can be computed from @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the covariant derivative associated with @xmath50 . for the line element ( [ lineel ] ) we find the non - zero components @xmath55 as well as the trace @xmath56 in many applications ( for example in the bssn formalism @xcite ) the extrinsic curvature is decomposed according to @xmath57 all singular terms are then absorbed in the conformal factor , leaving the regular terms @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 most of the above expressions simplify significantly .",
    "the 1+log slicing condition @xcite , which has proven to be extremely valuable in numerical simulations of black holes , is a member of the family of slicing conditions @xmath61 for the special choice @xmath62 . from the above expressions we see that the line element ( [ lineel ] ) satisfies the slicing condition ( [ slicingcondition ] ) if instead we choose @xmath63 or just @xmath64 for @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , this does not appear to be a very promising choice from the perspective of numerical relativity .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the properties of the resulting gauge speeds suggest that one should choose @xmath65 ; here , however , @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "we therefore do not expect the family of solutions ( [ lineel ] ) to be of great practical use in numerical relativity , at least for this slicing condition .",
    "we present a one - parameter family of analytical coordinate representations of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we believe that this family has some remarkable properties , in addition to being surprisingly simple : the coordinates penetrate smoothly through the event horizon , the spatial coordinates are isotropic , and the spatial slices feature a trumpet geometry .",
    "the family is parameterized by the areal radius @xmath1 of the sphere to which the trumpets asymptote ; for @xmath9 we recover painlev - gullstrand coordinates .",
    "while these coordinates may not be of great practical use in numerical relativity , we believe that they are interesting in their own right , and that they provide a simple pedagogical example of black holes in trumpet geometries .",
