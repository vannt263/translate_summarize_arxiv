    "in recent years , quantum information science has@xmath1 been a growing field which interests many researchers for potential high speed quantum computation and high security quantum communication .",
    "decoherence is commonly recognized as the main bottleneck .",
    "various schemes have been proposed to reduce such unexpected effects . in principle , there are two classes of schemes  open loop and closed loop strategies depending on the use of measurement and feedback .",
    "open loop strategies include quantum error - avoiding codes@xmath2 , bang - bang control@xmath3 , open loop optimal control@xmath4 and open loop coherent control@xmath5 , while closed loop strategies include quantum error - correction codes@xmath6 and quantum feedback control@xmath7 .",
    "though various strategies have been proposed , none of these strategies is satisfying to suppress decoherence for @xmath8-level markovian open quantum systems : quantum error - correction codes and error - avoiding codes use several physical qubits to encode one logical qubit , which is too luxurious under existing conditions ; bangbang control strategy is inapplicable in the fully markovian regime as pointed out by lidar@xmath9 ; open - loop optimal control strategy can only partially decouple quantum systems from the environmental noises ; quantum feedback control strategy requires complex feedback control apparatus and it is valid only for special physical systems . thus , for the decoherence suppression problem of @xmath8-level markovian open quantum systems , more system analysis and control methods should be introduced .    the closest work to ours can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where open loop coherent control is applied to decoherence suppression for single - qubit markovian systems .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath10-axis and @xmath11-axis variables of the bloch vector can be exactly decoupled from the environmental noises , which means that the coherence of the quantum state can be well preserved . however",
    ", this scheme requires solving a time - variant linear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) to obtain the open loop control laws , by which analytic control laws can be obtained only for phase damping decoherence under a strong assumption that the @xmath10-axis and @xmath11-axis variables of the bloch vector keep constant . for more general cases ,",
    "only numerical control laws can be obtained .",
    "furthermore , divergence of the control fields may occur in this strategy as pointed out by the authors@xmath9 . in this paper",
    ", we propose a more general noise decoupling strategy for @xmath8-level markovian open quantum systems based on the cartan decomposition of the lie algebra @xmath0 .",
    "open loop controls are designed to asymptotically decouple the state variables from the environmental noises .",
    "the strategy loses some precision but is easier to be fulfilled .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ] ,",
    "markovian open quantum systems are formulated in the coherence vector representation and the concept of the cartan decomposition of @xmath0 , together with three important assumptions , is introduced .",
    "our main results are presented in section [ s3 ] , where the scheme are also applied to one - qubit , qutrit and two - qubit systems .",
    "further discussion and conclusion are drawn in section [ s4 ] .",
    "consider an n - level markovian open quantum control system in the following master equation form : @xmath12+\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^m\\gamma_j \\mathbb{d}[l_j]\\rho , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\rho(t_0)=\\rho_0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the planck constant @xmath13 is assigned to be @xmath14 ; @xmath15 refers to the system density matrix ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent , respectively , the free hamiltonian and the control hamiltonians adjusted by the control parameters @xmath18 .",

    "the differential equation ( [ control master equation ] ) is actually a complex matrix differential equation which is hard to be analyzed .",
    "therefore , we will convert it into a real vector differential equation . for this purpose , an orthonormal basis @xmath21 with respect to the matrix inner product @xmath22",
    "should be introduced first , where @xmath23 is the @xmath24 identity matrix and @xmath25 are @xmath26 hermitian traceless matrices .",
    "the system density matrix @xmath15 can then be expressed as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the so - called coherence vector@xmath29 of @xmath15 . in this case , the quantum control system ( [ control master equation ] ) can be reexpressed by a differential equation on @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are , respectively , the adjoint representation matrices of @xmath33@xmath34 and @xmath35 is the coherence vector of @xmath36 . the term ",
    "@xmath37 \" comes from the decohering process represented by the lindblad terms in ( [ control master equation ] ) in which the dissipative matrix @xmath38 is semi - negative defined , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "the above approach is a generalization of the well - known bloch vector representation for two - level quantum systems .",
    "physically , the length of the coherence vector represents the amount of coherence in the quantum state .",
    "concretely , it is unit for the pure state and shorter for the mixed state .",
    "notice that the control @xmath40 drives the quantum state along a sphere on which coherence is conserved , while the decohering operators pull the vector towards the equilibrium state , e.g. the ground state in a spontaneous emission .    to simplify the equation ( [ coherent vector control system ] ) and facilitate our discussions ,",
    "it is useful to discuss the choice of the matrix basis @xmath41 . in this regard",
    ", we introduce the so - called * cartan decomposition*@xmath42 of the lie algebra @xmath0 as follows : @xmath43\\subset\\epsilon,\\,\\,[p , p]\\subset\\epsilon,\\,\\,[p,\\epsilon]\\subset p.\\ ] ]    notice that @xmath0 is a @xmath44 dimensional lie algebra of all traceless skew - hermitian @xmath24 matrices , hence the basis matrices of @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be expressed as @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are traceless hermitian matrices .",
    "further , every traceless hermitian matrix is a linear combination of @xmath51 .",
    "correspondingly , the density matrix @xmath15 can be represented as : @xmath52 as will be shown later , the matrices @xmath53 play central roles in our control strategy .",
    "in fact , * we will choose the control hamiltonians @xmath54 from these matrices*.    it should be pointed out that the cartan decomposition always exists . in fact , we can obtain a trivial decomposition if we let @xmath55 .",
    "the decomposition is also not unique .    before proceeding our discussions ,",
    "we introduce three assumptions for the equation ( [ coherent vector control system ] ) :    1 .",

    "@xcite for a rigorous proof ) .",
    "in other words , in the energy representation , the off - diagonal entries of the stationary system density matrix @xmath60 disappear as a result of decoherence .",
    "( h2 ) is introduced to guarantee the existence of the convergent solution of ( [ coherent vector control system ] ) .",
    "in fact , we can always make @xmath57 with the aid of the feedback control modification@xmath59 .",
    "( h3 ) is easy to be satisfied under special choices of the cartan decomposition .",
    "the term  @xmath37 \" in equation ( [ coherent vector control system ] ) is the environment - induced dissipative term which destroys coherence of the quantum states .",
    "our target is to select the control hamiltonians @xmath54 and design the corresponding controls @xmath62 to force the trajectory @xmath63 of the equation ( [ coherent vector control system ] ) as close as possible to the target trajectory @xmath64 which is the solution of the following unperturbed system : @xmath65    it has been demonstrated that the markovian open control system ( [ coherent vector control system ] ) is always uncontrollable@xmath34 . therefore , one can never track the target trajectory precisely . however , we will show that certain variables of @xmath63 may asymptotically tend to the corresponding variables of @xmath64 by properly designed control laws .",
    "that is to say , these variables can be asymptotically decoupled from the environmental noises .",
    "in fact , according to ( [ noise decoupling decomposition representation of the system density matrix ] ) , the coherence vector @xmath66 can be divided into two parts : @xmath67 , where @xmath68 from lemma [ lemma of the expression of o_0 , o_i ] , we have @xmath69 , where @xmath70 are respectively , @xmath66 and @xmath71 dimensional square anti - symmetric matrices , then the target trajectory can be written as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in this case , the vector @xmath75 can be driven to the corresponding target trajectory @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , we have the following theorem :    [ noise decoupling control design ] suppose the assumptions ( h1 ) , ( h2 ) and ( h3 ) are satisfied and the control hamiltonians @xmath54 in ( [ control master equation ] ) are the basis matrices @xmath77 corresponding to @xmath45 .",
    "the following control law @xmath78 steers the control trajectory @xmath63 of the equation ( [ coherent vector control system ] ) asymptotically to the stationary solution : @xmath79 where the constant vectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the solutions of the following nonlinear algebraic equation : @xmath82 where @xmath83    rigorous proof of the theorem is left to appendix [ proof of the noise decoupling control design theorem ] .",
    "theorem [ noise decoupling control design ] shows that the state variables of the coherence vector of @xmath15 corresponding to @xmath45 can be asymptotically decoupled from the environmental noises .",
    "note that @xmath84 is an @xmath66-dimensional anti - symmetric matrix which has only zero or pure imaginary eigenvalues , * the control laws presented in ( [ control law ] ) are in fact sinusoidal signals * which are usual for electro - magnetic fields used in the laboratory .",
    "next , we will apply our control strategy to three typical systems in quantum information science : one - qubit , qutrit and two - qubit systems .",
    "consider the one - qubit systems which are fundamental in the quantum information science .",
    "assume that the free hamiltonian @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the @xmath87-axis pauli matrix , then the cartan decomposition of the corresponding lie algebra @xmath88 can be chosen as @xmath89 , where the basis of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively .",
