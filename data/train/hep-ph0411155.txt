    "<S> correos 22085 , 46071 , valencia , spain _    the introduction of unitary techniques in the study of meson baryon interaction with chiral lagrangians has allowed to show that many of the low lying baryonic resonances are dynamically generated in the implicit process of multiple scattering , or equivalently , they qualify as quasibound meson baryon states . </S>",
    "<S> early studies in this direction pointed at the @xmath9 @xcite and the @xmath10 @xcite as dynamically generated resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the unitary methods to deal with the meson baryon interaction within the chiral framework have been made more systematic and a variety of them are now available , leading to remarkably similar results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the consequences of these studies is that the interaction of the baryon octet and meson octet leads to two octets and one singlet of dynamically generated resonances with @xmath11 @xcite , to which the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 belong .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting follow up of these developments has been recently done in @xcite with the interaction of the baryon decuplet with the meson octet . </S>",
    "<S> also in this case a number of @xmath12 resonances are dynamically generated , which are easily identified with known resonances in the pdg@xcite , and some other ones are predicted . </S>",
    "<S> these results have been confirmed in another study where poles and residues in the complex plane are searched for @xcite , and which allows one to get the couplings of the resonance to the different coupled channels . among these states </S>",
    "<S> there is one suggested in @xcite , and studied in detail in @xcite , and is formed from @xmath13 interaction with quantum numbers @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and is an exotic baryon impossible to construct with three constituent quarks , hence , a resonance as exotic as the @xmath16 discovered in spring8/osaka @xcite ( see also proceedings of the pentaquark04 workshop for an update of the experimental and theoretical status of this issue @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the side effects of the study of the @xmath16 state is the test for the production of standard resonances , which is conducted both as a proof that the methods used to identify resonances do indeed work , and also to determine regions of phase space which are ideal to reduce backgrounds and , hence , see a clearer signal of the @xmath16 state . </S>",
    "<S> one of the resonances thoroughly studied at spring8/osaka is the @xmath4 in the @xmath17 reaction using photons of @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 peak is clearly seen in the @xmath20 missing mass spectrum , which also shows a sizeable background at energies above the peak , even when the background from kaons coming from @xmath21 decay is eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> another experimental work on this reaction was done in @xcite using photons from @xmath22 , and similar features as in @xcite were observed . </S>",
    "<S> we shall see that the interaction of coupled channels which leads to the @xmath4 pole , together with the d - wave character of the @xmath4 resonance in its @xmath23 decay , can explain this background .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 is one of the dynamically generated resonances in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it appears from the interaction of the coupled channels @xmath1 and @xmath24 , mostly the first one . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the @xmath4 mass is just about 5 mev below the @xmath25 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> all these things make the @xmath4 qualify as a quasibound @xmath1 state . </S>",
    "<S> however , the small branching ratio of the @xmath4 to @xmath1 of about 4 percent in the only experiment available @xcite ( about 10 percent assuming , as done in the pdg , that the @xmath26 channel is mostly @xmath1 ) does not seem to indicate such a large coupling of the @xmath4 resonance to the @xmath1 state . actually , for the nominal values of the masses , the decay of the @xmath4 into this channel is forbidden since 1520 mev is about 5 mev below threshold of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is the width of the @xmath4 and the @xmath27 , which are both rather narrow , what makes the decay possible , however , relatively small . also , when the channels are so close to threshold the branching ratio to these channels is always partially a matter of choice since it depends on the energy cuts one is taking . </S>",
    "<S> a cleaner observable to find the coupling of the @xmath4 resonance to @xmath1 is hence called for . </S>",
    "<S> a consequence of the nature of the @xmath4 as an approximately quasibound state of @xmath6 is a relatively large coupling of the resonance to this channel , which the chiral unitary approach provides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the issues we address in this paper is how this coupling could be determined experimentally , which could shed light on the nature of the @xmath4 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we suggest the measurement of the ratio of cross sections for the reactions @xmath28 and we evaluate this ratio within the framework of the chiral unitary approach .    </S>",
    "<S> preliminary results for the first reaction of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : reac ] ) have been obtained at spring8/osaka @xcite , and experimental results are also available in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one observes there a clear peak of the @xmath4 in the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution on top of a moderate background at masses beyond the @xmath4 peak . </S>",
    "<S> another aim of the present work is to show that such a background appears naturally within the chiral unitary approach , which provides scattering amplitudes and not just poles of resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath4 is dynamically generated from the @xmath1 ( and to a much lesser extend the @xmath29 coupled channel @xcite ) , the microscopic description of the @xmath2 process would be given diagrammatically by the mechanism in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unit ] , in analogy whith what was done in @xcite for the photoproduction of the @xmath9 .        </S>",
    "<S> we shall try to make our results the least model dependent possible , hence we avoid making an explicit model for the @xmath30 amplitude at tree level ( @xmath31 ) and similarly we also avoid making a model for the final @xmath1 state decaying into @xmath32 . the only important thing to keep in mind </S>",
    "<S> is that the transition from the @xmath4 to @xmath32 proceeds in d - wave and this implies a factor @xmath33 in the transition amplitude , with @xmath34 the @xmath35 momentum in the @xmath32 center of mass frame . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism also involves the @xmath36 amplitude which implicitly contains the @xmath4 pole . for the rest of the amplitudes we shall assume a smooth energy dependence , </S>",
    "<S> although this assumption will be unnecessary when we study the ratio of the cross sections of the two reactions in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : reac ] ) , where the same vertex appears in both cases .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude for the @xmath37 reaction will be given by    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , are the vertices of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unit ] including , respectively , the first and last loop functions of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unit ] , involving the @xmath41 and @xmath27 propagators . </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume @xmath39 and @xmath40 smooth compared with the @xmath42 amplitude which incorporates the @xmath4 structure . </S>",
    "<S> the details on how to evaluate this latter amplitude can be seen in @xcite . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : t ] ) , @xmath43 stands for the scattering amplitude of @xmath44 in isospin @xmath45 which is obtained in @xcite within the framework of a chiral unitary approach using the @xmath46 unitarization method in coupled channels @xcite ( or equivalently the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite ) and contains the resummation of the dyson series involving @xmath6 and @xmath47 loops .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath48 invariant mass distribution for the reaction @xmath49 is given by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is supposed to be a constant and @xmath52 stands for the cosinus of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 angle which is fixed by the other variables and given by @xmath55    application of the results of @xcite to the present work requires some fine tunning which we describe here . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite the position of the @xmath4 appears around 1560 mev when using a global subtraction constant in the dispersion relation formula of @xcite to reproduce the bulk of the @xmath56 resonances , and the width is larger than the nominal one . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the @xmath57 channel is open at these energies . </S>",
    "<S> we can do fine tunning , changing the subtraction constant from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , which brings the position of the resonance down to 1520 mev and zero width , since it is below the @xmath6 threshold and we are ignoring the @xmath27 width and the @xmath32 and @xmath60 decay channels .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the coupling , @xmath61 , of the @xmath4 resonance to the @xmath1 channel by means of the residue of the @xmath62 amplitude , which close to the pole behaves as @xmath63 we obtain @xmath64 with that procedure and assume a conservative error for @xmath61 of @xmath65 percent . </S>",
    "<S> half of this uncertainty comes from varying the pole position of the @xmath4 within the experimental errors in the mass . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the error would come by assuming an uncertainty of abot @xmath66 in the @xmath27 mass to partly account for its width and from our neglect of the @xmath67 and @xmath68 channels in the build of the @xmath4 resonance . as mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a @xmath4 pole in the real axis with this prescription , and we have used the procedure to obtain the coupling @xmath61 which is rather stable with respect to small variations of the parameters .    on the other hand , in order to have a shape for the @xmath4 excitation similar to the one found in @xcite , we change the subtraction constant to @xmath69 to @xmath70 and simultaneously the mass of the @xmath27 by about @xmath71 ( to simulate contributions coming from the consideration of the @xmath27 width ) . by means of this , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a finite width , which allows for a realistic distribution of the strength of the resonance .        in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dares ] we show the experimental results for @xmath72 in the @xmath2 reaction from daresbury @xcite , together with results of our model for the two different values of the subtraction constants which have been fine tuned to get an approximate agreement with the experimental data from the @xmath4 peak onward . </S>",
    "<S> we have not made any attempt to reproduce the data below the @xmath4 peak since the deficiencies of our model ( not including the @xmath67 and @xmath68 channels , the only ones open below the @xmath6 threshold ) do not allow for a realistic description of the data in that region . </S>",
    "<S> however , our model contains the coupling of the @xmath4 to @xmath6 which is largely dominant , and as soon as there is phase space for @xmath6 it becomes mostly responsible for the strength of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the fine tuning of the subtraction constant changes moderately the strength at the peak but barely changes the strength in the region of @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the comparatively large strength of the distribution at energies higher than the peak is due to the large @xmath74 amplitude in this region , together with the @xmath33 character of the @xmath75wave transition amplitude @xmath76 . in order to give an idea of the relative size of this strength in this region , we show in the same figure the distribution produced by a naive breit - wigner resonance around the peak ( including also the @xmath33 factor in the amplitude ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see a sizeable difference which is tied to the large @xmath74 amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this is why we consider this mechanism mostly responsible for the strength in this region , particularly at energies close to the tail of the @xmath4 resonance , in spite that there are other terms of non resonant nature that can produce a background there , which we are not considering . </S>",
    "<S> we would also like to note that most models for the @xmath4 ( like quark models ) that just provide a mass and a width for the resonance , would lead to a distribution ( in the absence of the background terms neglected by us ) given approximately by the breit - wigner distribution shown in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between this breit - wigner form and the distribution of our model is a genuine consequence of the unitary chiral dynamics assumed in our approach .        </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to see what our model gives for @xmath72 at the photon energies of spring8/osaka @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we show the results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spring8 ] where we have made the average for various energies of the beam in this interval and binned the results with a resolution of @xmath78 of the experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show the results for the two different values of the subtraction constant which we used before to account for uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we see from the results that there is also a sizeable background at energies above the peak . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the preliminary data of @xcite , not shown in the figure , is rather fair . </S>",
    "<S> this exercise has served to show consistency of the preliminary data obtained in spring8/osaka with the old data of daresbury @xcite , particularly concerning the background beyond the @xmath4 peak , which is a matter of concern when testing the ability of experimental methods to deal with backgrounds and identify peaks on top of them . </S>",
    "<S> + the other issue we address now is the evaluation of the cross section for @xmath79        with our assumption that the @xmath4 is a dynamically generated resonance , mostly from @xmath25 interaction , the mechanism for the reaction of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : kk1 ] ) is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unitb ] , where we can see that it shares with that of the @xmath37 reaction the primary production of @xmath1 and the full @xmath80 scattering matrix . </S>",
    "<S> only the final vertices , leading to different final states , are different between these reactions </S>",
    "<S> . we can easily establish a link between these two vertices using simultaneously empirical information of the @xmath4 decay into @xmath48 and the theoretical value for the coupling of the @xmath4 to @xmath1 .    in order to make the comparison between the two processes clearer , we draw schematically in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : unitc ] the previous figures [ fig : unit ] and [ fig : unitb ] ,        which shows more transparently that what we need is the coupling of the @xmath4 resonance to the two decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling to the @xmath1 we already found theoretically , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pole ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the one to the @xmath48 we find now empirically . from the pdg </S>",
    "<S> we know that the partial decay width of the @xmath4 to @xmath32 is 7.02 mev . </S>",
    "<S> since the vertex is of d - wave type we can take for it @xmath81 with the same normalization as the coupling of the @xmath4 to @xmath1 , by means of which the @xmath4 partial decay width into @xmath32 is given by    @xmath82    this gives @xmath83 .    all this said , the ratio of cross sections for the two reactions is given by    @xmath84    with @xmath85 the corresponding @xmath52 variable , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : a ] ) , for the kinematics of the @xmath5 channel , and @xmath86 is the common invariant mass of the @xmath87 and @xmath3 system . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 scattering matrix cancels in the numerator and denominator in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : r ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the ratio of mass distributions for the two processes is given by the ratio of the couplings squared and the phase space , including the factor @xmath88 in the @xmath89 channel .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have not made any distinction for the charge of the final states since we have being using the isospin basis and have taken the @xmath1 amplitudes in @xmath90 , the channel of the @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the isospin decomposition of the @xmath23 and @xmath1 states is given in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : iso1 ] ) and ( [ eq : iso2 ] )    @xmath91    @xmath92    we see in the equations that , neglecting the @xmath93 , for which the amplitudes in the chiral unitary approach are very small , the @xmath94 channel is purely of @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> this channel is hence ideal to isolate the @xmath90 term . on the other hand , similarly to what was done in @xcite in the photoproduction of the @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , one can see that the cross sections are proportional to    @xmath95    thus , both the @xmath94 channel and the average of the @xmath96 and @xmath97 cross sections can be used to isolate the @xmath90 cross section , provided that the @xmath15 cross section is relatively small compared to the @xmath90 one . </S>",
    "<S> this exercise of removing the interference term between @xmath90 and @xmath15 , may be important in case the @xmath15 component were not much smaller that the @xmath90 one , since @xmath98 can be small compared to @xmath99 but not the interference term </S>",
    "<S> . this could be the case since in the region close to @xmath100 , there is another @xmath56 dynamically generated resonance , the @xmath101 , constructed from the same building blocks than the @xmath4 , @xmath25 , together with @xmath102 to which the resonance couples with largest strength . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the @xmath101 should in principle be already seen in the experiment of spring8 , @xcite , but there is no trace of this resonance in this experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this could be understood in terms of the small branching ratio of that resonance to the @xmath23 system , which is about @xmath103 percent according to the pdg by contrast to the @xmath104 percent of the @xmath4 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we also have a small branching ratio of the @xmath101 to @xmath25 which is also of the order of 10 percent as reconstructed from the @xmath105 ratio of the pdg . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the background of @xmath15 in the spectrum of @xmath23 , or in the one of @xmath25 , should be relatively small , and we can rely upon the @xmath90 dominance of the amplitudes of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : t ] ) , particularly in the region between the @xmath4 and @xmath101 , this is , around 1550 - 1630 mev . </S>",
    "<S> given the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the isospin decomposition of the @xmath48 and @xmath94 states in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : iso1 ] ) and ( [ eq : iso2 ] ) , we then conclude that the ratio of mass distributions for these observable channels is given by    @xmath106    for the reasons given above , the average of the @xmath96 and @xmath107 cross sections could be similarly used instead of the @xmath94 one , which is not observable at present in some labs like spring8 .        in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ratio ] we plot the ratio of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rb ] ) as a function of the @xmath48 and @xmath94 invariant mass for @xmath64 and @xmath108 . in our model </S>",
    "<S> , this ratio is independent of the photon energy . however , the photon energy is relevant to establish the maximum invariant mass where the ratio can be defined . </S>",
    "<S> we can see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ratio ] that , in the region we suggest , @xmath109 , the ratio @xmath110 decreases from values around @xmath111 to @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the bump in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ratio ] has nothing to do with the @xmath4 resonance , since the amplitudes producing it have canceled in the ratio . </S>",
    "<S> it comes essentially from the phase space of the two reactions . with assumed uncertainties of about @xmath65 percent in @xmath113 , which would lead to about @xmath114 percent uncertainties in the ratio of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ratio ] and extra uncertainties from approximations done , we assume that an error of about @xmath115 percent is a conservative estimate of the uncertainties in the calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained are essentially related to the theoretical coupling , @xmath61 , of the @xmath4 to the @xmath25 channel which is predicted by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> hence the actual measurement of the ratio discussed , when compared with theoretical predictions , would produce an experimental measurement of that coupling which could substantiate the claim that the @xmath4 is a dynamically generated resonance from the interaction of the @xmath1 and @xmath24 coupled channels , and particularly from the first one .    at the same time it would be interesting to evaluate the same coupling with present quark models to see if there are substantial differences , such that the experimental determination of the coupling could clearly favor one picture over the other one . </S>",
    "<S> + summarizing the results , we have done a study of some implications of the nature of the @xmath4 resonance from a perspective of chiral unitary dynamics in which framework the resonance appears as a dynamically generated state , mostly from the @xmath6 interaction in @xmath116 and @xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> first we have addressed the origin of the cross section for the @xmath2 reaction at invariant masses close and above the @xmath4 mass . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical origin of the @xmath4 within the chiral unitary approach , together with the @xmath75wave character of the @xmath117 decay , are responsible in our model for this relatively large strength , which is tied to a large coupling of the @xmath4 to the @xmath6 channel and a fairly large @xmath74 amplitude in @xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> second we have made predictions of the ratio of the @xmath5 to the @xmath2 cross sections , which is closely tied to the value of the @xmath4 coupling to @xmath6 , and which is provided by the chiral unitary approach . therefore , an experimental measurement of such ratio would provide a test of the claimed nature of this resonance . </S>"
