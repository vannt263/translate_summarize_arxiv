    "the beginning of the 80 s witnessed a triumph of the one - parameter scaling theory of localization @xcite and the theory of electron - electron interactions in disordered conductors ( for a review , see ref .  ) . as a result",
    ", the peculiar low - temperature behavior of the conductivity of numerous low - dimensional systems has been successfully attributed to quantum interference effects ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "curiously , application of these ideas to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron liquid in si  mosfets - one of the most ubiquitous 2d systems - remained a challenge for more than 25 years . in the early experiments",
    "@xcite with low - mobility ( @xmath7m@xmath8/vs ) structures in the regime of relatively high electron densities ( @xmath9@xmath1 ) , a decrease of the conductivity with cooling has been observed , apparently in qualitative agreement with the ideas of weak localization @xcite and electron - electron interactions @xcite . however , the quantitative description of this behavior remained a problem @xcite .",
    "the disagreement with the theory became qualitative with the advent of high - mobility ( @xmath10m@xmath8/vs ) structures : the low@xmath11 conductivity of high-@xmath12 si  mosfets increased with decreasing temperature , in striking contrast to the behavior of many other 2d systems .",
    "this `` metallic '' behavior of the conductivity is especially pronounced at low electron densities @xmath13@xmath1 , where a five - fold increase of @xmath14 with cooling was observed @xcite .",
    "later , the quasi - linear increase of @xmath14 was observed in many high - mobility 2d systems in the `` dilute '' regime , including gaas heterostructures ( both @xmath15-type @xcite and @xmath16-type @xcite ) , si / sige @xcite , and alas @xcite quantum wells .",
    "the subsequent development of theory and experiment led to significant progress in our understanding of the low - temperature transport in high - mobility systems in the regime of low electron densities . in the mid-80 s ,",
    "the quasi - linear `` metallic '' dependence observed in the ballistic interaction regime @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the transport mean free time , here and below we set @xmath19 ) was attributed @xcite to weakening of the screening of the scattering potential with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "observation of a strong negative magnetoconductance induced by the in - plane magnetic field @xcite and renormalization of the effective electron mass and @xmath20factor in these structures @xcite also suggested that the electron - electron interactions play an important role in this phenomenon .",
    "more recently , zala , narozhny , and aleiner ( zna ) @xcite developed a theory that took into account all interaction contributions to the conductivity , including the exchange ones .",
    "this theory offers a unified approach to both ballistic ( @xmath21 ) and diffusive ( @xmath22 ) interaction regimes by considering the quantum interference between electron waves scattered off a short - range random potential `` dressed '' by friedel oscillations of the electron density .",
    "the theory was extended for the case of a long - range scattering potential by gornyi and mirlin ( gm ) @xcite .",
    "the theories @xcite naturally incorporate the altshuler - aronov results for the interaction corrections to the conductivity in the diffusive regime @xcite .",
    "for the diffusive regime , a more general approach to interacting systems based on the nonlinear @xmath4-model has been developed by finkelstein @xcite .",
    "recently , the renormalization group ( rg ) equations of this theory @xcite ( obtained in the first order in @xmath23 and in all orders in interaction ) have been compared with the conductivity of si  mosfets at low electron densities @xcite .",
    "the rg equations @xcite describe the length scale ( temperature ) evolution of the resistivity and interaction parameters for a 2d electron system in the diffusive regime @xcite . however , at high electron densities , the temperature range corresponding to the diffusive regime shrinks .",
    "in contrast , the theory of interaction corrections @xcite is applicable over a wider @xmath5 range ( that includes both ballistic and diffusive regimes ) provided @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; these assumptions are well justified at high densities .",
    "the theories@xcite predict that the magnitude and sign of the the interaction correction @xmath26 is determined by the value of the fermi - liquid parameter @xmath27 ( which can be found by measuring the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations in weak magnetic fields perpendicular to the plane of a 2d structure @xcite or the magnetoresistance in strong in - plane magnetic fields@xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it is expected that the @xmath14 dependence becomes `` metallic '' when @xmath27 is negative and its absolute value exceeds a certain threshold ( see sec .",
    "the experimental studies of the conductivity in various low - carrier - density 2d systems in the ballistic ( high - temperature ) regime are in agreement with the zna and gm theories .",
    "the `` metallicity '' in all these systems is enhanced at low @xmath16 due to an increase of the absolute value of @xmath27 ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . in si  mosfets ,",
    "the interaction effects are especially strong due to the presence of two nearly degenerate valleys in the electron spectrum @xcite .",
    "this enhancement , however , diminishes if the temperature @xmath5 becomes smaller than the valley splitting @xmath28 and intervalley scattering rate @xmath29 . as a result , with lowering @xmath5 , the `` metallic '' dependence of @xmath14 is expected to become weaker or even to be replaced with an `` insulating '' one . to the best of our knowledge , this behavior has not been observed for si  mosfets prior to our work .",
    "this paper aims to study in detail the conductivity of 2d electron liquid in high - mobility ( 001 )  si  mosfets over a wide temperature range ( @xmath30k ) that includes both the _ diffusive _ and _ ballistic _ regimes .",
    "in particular , we observed for the first time that the `` metallic '' increase of @xmath4 with cooling is followed by the downturn of @xmath14 at lower temperatures . for the purpose of comparison with the zna theory @xcite",
    ", we studied the range of not - too - low densities , @xmath31cm@xmath8 , where the temperature and magnetic field dependences @xmath26 can still be treated as small corrections to the drude conductivity @xmath33 . in principle , no fitting parameters are required for comparison with the theory , because we have measured @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath34 in independent experiments . however , below we take a slightly different approach : we obtain the @xmath35 values from fitting the @xmath36 dependences with the zna theory @xcite , and show that these values are consistent with the corresponding values extracted from the analysis of sdh oscillations @xcite .",
    "we have also revealed shortcomings of earlier analysis of @xmath37 , reanalyzed the available data , and compared the extracted values of @xmath35 with corresponding values from other measurements .",
    "we conclude that the experimental data are well described by the theory of interaction corrections @xcite at intermediate temperatures @xmath38k . for a quantitative analysis at ultra - low temperatures ( @xmath39k ) ,",
    "the interaction correction theory should be modified by taking into account finite intervalley scattering rates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly summarize the theoretical results @xcite for the interaction corrections to the conductivity of a two - valley system .",
    "the experimental data are presented in section iii , along with the data analysis and discussion .",
    "the summary is given in section iv .",
    "in the zna theory @xcite , the corrections @xmath40 to the drude conductivity @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the electron band mass in ( 001 )  si  mosfets ; for more detail , see discussion in section [ m_b ] and references therein ) were calculated in both ballistic and diffusive regimes for all orders of the interaction strength and the leading order in @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , the theory reproduces the altshuler - aronov correction@xcite to the conductivity in the diffusive regime . to adapt the theoretical results @xcite to the case of ( 001 )",
    "si  mosfets , one should take into account that the electron spectrum in this system has two almost degenerate valleys @xcite .",
    "in zero magnetic field , @xmath45 for a system with two degenerate valleys in the absence of intervalley scattering can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the so - called `` charge '' contribution which combines fock correction and the singlet part of hartree correction , and @xmath48 is the `` triplet '' contribution due to the triplet part of hartree term . the valley index can be considered as a pseudo - spin in multi - valley systems @xcite , and the valley degeneracy determines the number of triplet terms due to the spin exchange processes between electrons in different valleys . for a system with two degenerate valleys , the total number of interaction channels is @xmath49 , among them 1 singlet and 15 triplet terms ( for comparison , there are 1 singlet and 3 triplet terms for a single - valley system ) .    below",
    "we assume that the scattering potential is short - ranged which is relevant to si mosfets . according to ref .",
    ", the charge term does not depend on the details of interactions : @xmath50 whereas the magnitude and sign of the triplet term is controlled by the fermi - liquid parameter @xcite @xmath27 : @xmath51 the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eqs .",
    "( [ 2],[3 ] ) describe the crossover between the diffusive ( @xmath54 ) and ballistic ( @xmath55 ) regimes ; outside the crossover region , they change the value of @xmath40 by only a few percent .",
    "the explicit expressions for these functions can be found in ref .  .",
    "the diffusive - ballistic crossover is expected over some temperature range near @xmath56 equations ( [ 2],[3 ] ) describe the quantum corrections in a system with the conductance @xmath57 at temperatures well below the fermi energy @xmath58 $ ] .    the sign and the magnitude of @xmath40",
    "is controlled by the fermi - liquid parameter @xmath27 . for a rough estimate , deeply in the ballistic regime the @xmath59 terms and the crossover functions @xmath53 and @xmath52 in eqs .",
    "( [ 2],[3 ] ) can be omitted .",
    "for example , at @xmath60 , the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 contribute @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , to the linear - in-@xmath63 ballistic terms of eqs .",
    "( [ 2],[3 ] ) . by neglecting these terms , we find that for a single - valley system the linear dependence @xmath45 in the ballistic regime becomes `` metallic '' ( @xmath64 ) at @xmath65 or @xmath66 , whereas for a system with two degenerate valleys , the `` metallic '' @xmath45 dependences are expected for @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the valley degeneracy extends the range of @xmath69 , and hence , the range of carrier densities @xmath16 where the conduction exhibits the `` metallic '' behavior .      the in - plane magnetic field , being coupled mostly to electron spins , provides a useful tool for exploring the interaction effects in the low - temperature conductivity of si  mosfets @xcite .",
    "when the zeeman energy @xmath70 ( @xmath71 is the bare @xmath72-factor , @xmath73 is the bohr magneton ) becomes much greater than @xmath5 , the number of triplet terms that contribute to @xmath45 is reduced from 15 to 7 .",
    "similar reduction of triplet terms is expected for a valley splitting @xmath74 .",
    "these two effects have been accounted by the theory of interaction corrections @xcite ; in the presence of the magnetic field and/or valley splitting the interaction correction to the conductivity can be expressed as follows @xcite :    @xmath75    where @xmath45 is given by eq .",

    "it is worth mentioning that in the framework of the rg theory , the magnetoconductance can also be described by the castellani - di castro - lee formula @xcite which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) in the diffusive limit at @xmath86 .",
    "however , for the analysis of our magnetoconductivity data measured over a wide @xmath5-range that includes both diffusive and ballistic regimes , the interaction correction theory @xcite is more appropriate than the rg theory @xcite .",
    "the interaction correction theory @xcite ( as well as the rg theory @xcite ) does not take into account intervalley scattering .",
    "this approximation is valid when the intervalley scattering rate @xmath87 is much smaller than @xmath5 . in the low - temperature limit @xmath88 ,",
    "the electron states in different valleys are completely intermixed at the time scale @xmath89 and the correction @xmath45 for a two - valley system is expected to coincide with that for a single - valley system . since the interaction corrections to the conductivity @xmath90 depend on several parameters such as @xmath91 and @xmath92 , for testing the theoretical results",

    "note that in our previous experiments @xcite , we observed a trend of @xmath14 saturation at @xmath175k rather than the decrease of the conductivity .",
    "one of the reasons for this might have been `` heating '' of electrons by high frequency noise : only after thorough filtering of all leads connected to the sample were we able to decrease the electron temperature down to @xmath176mk .",

    "the corresponding values of @xmath35 are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath5 range available for fitting in this regime `` shrinks '' rapidly at low @xmath16 : the growth of @xmath139 and decrease of @xmath183 with decreasing @xmath16 , lead to violation of the condition @xmath184 ( e.g. , at @xmath185@xmath1 this occurs at temperatures above 2k ) .",

    "after finding the @xmath27 values ( which are temperature - independent in the studied temperature range ) , we proceed with the analysis of the low@xmath11 part of the @xmath14 dependences , where the crossover from @xmath64 to @xmath188 was observed .",
    "we note that the crossover occurs when the temperature becomes smaller than two characteristic temperature scales - @xmath28 and @xmath87 - which are of the same order of magnitude for the studied structures .",
    "we emphasize that according to the zna theory@xcite , the ballistic - diffusive crossover should not lead to the change of the sign of @xmath189 .",
    "in contrast , the valley splitting and the intervalley scattering may result in the sign change for @xmath189 because these processes reduce the number of triplet components at @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",

    "the solid red curves in fig .  2 are calculated for @xmath192k ( the estimated value of @xmath28 for sample si6 - 14 ) and @xmath193 .",
    "it is clear that the change in the number of triplet components from 15 ( @xmath194 ) to 7 ( @xmath195 ) @xcite ( see also eq .  [ 5 ] ) is not sufficient to explain the shape of the @xmath14 downturn .",
    "the effect of strong intervalley scattering is illustrated in fig .  2 by dashed green curves calculated with 3 triplet components ( to model roughly the case of @xmath88 when the valleys are completely intermixed ) .",

    "this crossover function provides correct asymptotic limits for @xmath198 : 3 at @xmath88 and 15 at @xmath199 .",

    "better understanding of different contributions to @xmath37 can be achieved by measuring the conductivity in strong in - plane magnetic fields @xmath201 .",
    "the evolution of experimental dependences @xmath14 with @xmath200 is shown in fig .  3 for two samples at different electron densities .",
    "the theoretical curves in fig .",
    "3 were calculated using the @xmath35 values extracted from the analysis of @xmath202 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the transport time @xmath18 was calculated for each @xmath200 value from the drude conductivity @xmath203 which in turn was estimated by extrapolating the quasi - linear part of the @xmath143 dependence to @xmath159 .",
    "the observed behavior is in line with our analysis of the @xmath14 dependences in section iii b. indeed , the magnitude of the triplet contribution is expected to be reduced when the zeeman energy becomes greater than @xmath5 .",
    "this effect is more pronounced within the range @xmath28 , @xmath204 , where a strong magnetic field reduces the number of triplet components from 15 to 7 .",
    "for example , at @xmath205@xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "3d ) the `` metallic '' behavior disappears at @xmath206k and @xmath207 t , which is in agreement with the theory . at lower @xmath5 ,",

    ", we also measured the @xmath209 dependences at fixed @xmath5 .",

    "the mc for sample si6 - 14 over the field range @xmath210 t is shown for different densities and temperatures in fig .",
    "4 . in these measurements ,",
    "special care was taken to reduce the magnetic field component perpendicular to the plane of the structure : even a @xmath211 misalignment between the sample s plane and the magnet axis ( which results in @xmath212 g at @xmath213 t ) may be sufficiently strong for suppressing the wl corrections at low @xmath5 . to eliminate @xmath214 , we used the cross - magnetic - field set - up@xcite . for each value of @xmath200",
    ", we measured the dependence @xmath215 by sweeping @xmath214 and recorded the minimum value of @xmath215 which corresponded to the zero wl magnetoconductance and , thus , @xmath216 .",

    "4 as solid curves , describe the observed mc very well in not - too - strong magnetic fields @xmath218 . again , as in the case of fitting the @xmath37 dependences , the only adjustable parameter was the @xmath35 value extracted for each density from fitting the mc at high temperatures ( @xmath219k ) where the effects of valley splitting or intervalley scattering on @xmath90 can be neglected .",
    "note that all the theoretical curves plotted in fig .",
    "4 for the same @xmath16 were calculated for a fixed @xmath35 , i.e. neglecting possible dependence @xmath220 .",
    "the detailed analysis of the spin susceptibility @xmath221 in strong magnetic field , presented in ref .",
    ", shows that the product @xmath118 decreases with an increase of @xmath200 by as much as @xmath222 .",
    "our estimate shows that by ignoring the @xmath223 dependence , we might reduce the value of @xmath224 by @xmath225 ( see below ) , which is close to the accuracy of extraction of @xmath27 from the data in strong magnetic fields .",
    "as @xmath200 grows and/or @xmath16 decreases , the data start deviating from the theoretical curves ( see fig .",
    "4d ) ; this deviation can be attributed to the violation of the condition @xmath226 required for applicability of eqs .",
    "( [ 5],[6 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath27 values obtained from fitting the @xmath37 and @xmath217 dependences with the theory @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "5 . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the @xmath27 values obtained from the analysis of sdh oscillations measured for sample si6 - 14 using the theories @xcite ( see section iii a ) .",
    "the @xmath27 values obtained from fitting @xmath37 are in good agreement with the corresponding values extracted from the analysis of sdh data . at the same time , the @xmath224 values obtained from fitting the @xmath217 dependences at @xmath227 are systematically smaller than the corresponding values obtained from fitting @xmath37 and sdh oscillations .",
    "this trend was earlier reported in refs .. there are at least two factors that can reduce this discrepancy .",
    "one of them , a potential decrease of @xmath102 in strong @xmath200 , was mentioned in section iii d. the other factor is more subtle . in our analysis , we neglected the dependence of the wl correction @xmath228 on @xmath200 .",
    "however , our measurements show that @xmath228 decreases with an increase of the in - plane magnetic field , which leads to a positive magnetoconductance .",
    "there are at least two potential reasons for this dependence : ( a )  the si - sio@xmath113 interface roughness transforms a uniform in - plane field into a random perpendicular field ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein ) , and ( b )  a finite extent of electron wave functions in the direction perpendicular to the plane of a quantum well causes sub - band mixing by the magnetic field and disorder ( see , e.g. , ref . and references therein ) .",
    "phenomenologically , both effects can be described in terms of a decrease of the dephasing length @xmath229 with @xmath200 .",
    "for example , from the analysis of the wl magnetoresistance measured for different values of @xmath200 for sample si6 - 14 at @xmath230@xmath1 and @xmath231 , we have extracted @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "our estimates show that the positive magnetoconductance associated with the suppression of @xmath228 by @xmath200 can account for @xmath225 of the observed @xmath200-induced magnetoconductance . after taking the dependences @xmath234 and @xmath235 into account ,",
    "the @xmath224 values extracted from the mc should be increased by @xmath222 .",
    "the corresponding downshift of the @xmath27 values extracted from the @xmath236 data is shown by arrows in fig .",
    "5a , it significantly reduces the discrepancy between the values of @xmath27 extracted from the @xmath170 data and the data measured at @xmath237 t .",
    "finally , in order to compare our data with other available @xmath37 data for high - mobility si  mosfets , we have used eqs .",
    "( [ 1][6 ] ) to estimate the @xmath27 values from the quasi - linear @xmath238 dependences measured by shashkin et al.@xcite and vitkalov et al.@xcite . in this analysis , we estimated @xmath18 from @xmath239 using the band mass rather than @xmath101 .",
    "as for the valley splitting , we have used @xmath240k and @xmath241k for the analysis of data from ref . and , respectively .",
    "( the value @xmath242k used in ref . seems to be too large , as it would lead to the appearance of beating of sdh oscillations in the field range studied in ref . ) .",
    "we have also taken into account the wl correction neglected in both ref . and .",
    "figure  5b shows that the @xmath108 values estimated for different si  mosfets using the zna theory are in good agreement with each other .",
    "the @xmath27 values obtained on the basis of the interaction correction theory and plotted in fig .  5 may be compared also with the values of @xmath243 predicted by the rg theory and measured experimentally in refs .. extrapolation of our @xmath108 data to lower densities , provides the value @xmath244 at @xmath245@xmath1 ( @xmath246 ) , which is _ smaller _ than the value @xmath247 ( @xmath248 ) predicted by the one - loop rg theory for the temperature @xmath249 corresponding to the @xmath250 maximum @xcite ( e.g. , @xmath251k for @xmath252@xmath1 ) .",
    "the experimental test@xcite of the rg theory was conducted at temperatures higher than that in the experiments described in the present work . within the framework of the rg theory ,",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath253 is expected to increases with decreasing @xmath5@xcite and , in principle , it can reach at @xmath254 the value of @xmath255 which corresponds to @xmath256 .",
    "( note that the factor - of - two increase of @xmath253 ( from @xmath257 to @xmath258 ) is beyond the range of the applicability of the one - loop rg theory . )",
    "another problem is that the spin susceptibility @xmath221 obtained from the sdh data is almost @xmath5-independent @xcite , in contrast to the expected increase of @xmath253 ( and , hence , @xmath224 and @xmath102 ) with cooling .",
    "this contradiction can be resolved if the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath102 is exactly compensated by the opposite @xmath5-dependence of @xmath101 , so that @xmath259 remains almost constant .",
    "the reason for this compensation is not clear and requires both experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "our experiments show that the low-@xmath5 behavior of the conductivity of high - mobility ( 001 )  si  mosfets is well described by the theory of interaction effects in systems with short - range disorder @xcite . over a wide range of intermediate temperatures ( @xmath260 ) ,",
    "the interaction effects are strongly enhanced in si  mosfets due to the presence of two valleys in the electron spectrum .",
    "this factor , in combination with the interaction - driven renormalization of the fermi - liquid parameter @xmath27 , leads to an increase of @xmath4 with decreasing @xmath5 . at lower temperatures ( @xmath261 ) , the triplet contribution to @xmath45",
    "is significantly reduced due to valley splitting and/or intervalley scattering . as a result",
    ", the `` metallic '' behavior of @xmath4 is replaced with a more conventional , `` insulating '' behavior .",
    "the @xmath27 values obtained from fitting the experimental data with the theory @xcite agree well with the @xmath27 data obtained from the analysis of sdh oscillations in these samples .",
    "however , it remains unclear how to reconcile the @xmath27 values obtained at low @xmath16 from fitting the @xmath14 and sdh data by using the interaction correction theory with the corresponding values obtained within framework of the rg theory .",
    "we emphasize that for the detailed analysis of the interaction - induced contributions to the conductivity , it is important to measure such parameters as the valley splitting and intervalley scattering rate in independent experiments .",
    "finally , for a quantitative description of the interaction effects to the conductivity @xmath40 at low temperatures , both the interaction correction theory and rg theory should be extended to the case of a finite intervalley scattering rate .",
