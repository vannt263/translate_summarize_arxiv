    "<S> the pure penguin process @xmath0 is one of the most important probes of physics beyond the standard model . </S>",

    "<S> it is well known that flavor - changing neutral currents induced in @xmath1 decays are one of the best probes of new physics beyond the standard model because they arise only through loop effects in the standard model ( sm ) . to this end , the decays @xmath0 are of particular interests , since they are pure penguin processes and have interesting polarization phenomena as well as relatively clear experiment signature . within the sm </S>",
    "<S> , it is expected that both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are mainly longitudinally polarized , while its transverse polarization is suppressed by the power of @xmath4 . however , last year both babar and belle had observed rather small longitudinal polarizations in the decays @xmath5 due to @xmath6 , both groups have measured unexpectedly large transverse polarizations in the @xmath7 decays .    this summer babar collaboration has again reported their full angular analysis of the the decay @xmath8  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite @xmath9 which has confirmed their previous measurements and called urgent theoretical explanations .    the final states @xmath2 and @xmath10 are fast moving in the @xmath1 meson frame and any spin flip of fast flying quark will be suppressed by power of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the charge interaction currents structure of the sm is left - handed , therefore , will result in the dominance of longitudinal polarization . </S>",
    "<S> such situation has been known to us for many years  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so that , the recent measurements of large transverse polarizations in @xmath0 are referred as a puzzle within the high energy physics community  @xcite .    the analysis of the decays within the sm can be performed in terms of an effective low - energy theory with the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath12 the amplitude for the decay within the sm can be written as @xmath13~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath1 meson is a pseudoscalar , the final two vector mesons must have the same helicity . in the helicity basis </S>",
    "<S> , the amplitude can be decomposed into three helicity amplitudes , which are @xmath14~,\\nonumber \\\\   h_{\\pm\\pm}&=&i\\frac{g_f}{\\sqrt{2}}v_{tb}v_{ts}^ { * }   a(\\phi k^ * ) m_{\\phi}f_{\\phi } \\left [   ( m_{b}+m_{k^*})a_1 \\mp \\frac{2m_b p_c } { m_b + m_{k^*}}v   \\right]~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in naive factorization  @xcite , @xmath15 then the branching ratio is thus read as @xmath16 and the longitudinal and the transverse polarization rates are @xmath17 using the wilson coefficients @xmath18 evaluated at scale of @xmath19  @xcite , and the decay constants @xmath20 gev , @xmath21 gev and the form factors of light - cone qcd sum - rules  @xcite , one can get @xmath22    it must be reminded that a theoretical estimation of the branching ratios depend very strongly on the form factors from different hadronic models and the theoretical frameworks of @xmath1 meson nonletponic decays , even though most frameworks and form factors predict dominance of the longitudinal polarizations . for example , recent calculation of @xmath23 by cheng and yang by using qcd factorization  @xcite gives @xmath24 for lcsr and @xmath25 for bsw form - factors  @xcite , respectively , while pqcd  @xcite calculation gives @xmath26 where form - factors are not inputs . however , both studies present the dominance of longitudinal polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> after babar and belle measurements of the abnormal large transverse polarization , there have been some theoretical explanations ; namely , through the final state interactions ( fsi ) contributions  @xcite , large annihilation contributions and new physics from right - hand current interactions  @xcite and transverse @xmath2 from the emitted gluon of @xmath27 which might be enhanced by new physics  @xcite .    in this letter , we investigate the possibility that the abnormally large transverse polarization may arise from a new tensor interaction beyond the sm ( bsm ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the relative interaction strength normalized to that of @xmath30 in the sm and @xmath31 is the new physics phase . in principle , such a tensor operator could be produced even in mssm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the recent study of radiative pion decay @xmath32 at pibeta  @xcite has found deviations from the sm in the high-@xmath33 kinematic region , which may indicate the existence of a tensor quark - lepton interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that kagan mentioned the case of tensor operator for resolving the puzzle  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our starting point arises from the observation that the tensor interaction only contributes to transverse polarization but not to longitudinal one . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element reads  @xcite @xmath34 which is scaled as @xmath35 since @xmath36 for fast flying @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the @xmath2 meson is produced instead from a vector interaction vertex , we will have @xmath37 , and it is easy to understand that the longitudinal polarization dominate over the transverse one by a large factor @xmath38 because of @xmath39 .    using the form factors defined in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we can write down the amplitude of the tensor operator in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tensor ] ) in naive factorization approximation , @xmath40 from this equation , we can get the new physics contributions , @xmath41~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] compared with eq.9 , the tensor interaction contributions to @xmath42 are enhanced by a factor of @xmath43 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     numerical results are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , we can find that the transverse polarization in @xmath44 is very sensitive to the presence of new tensor interactions . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath45 , we can easily find solutions to the polarization puzzle depending on the phase of the tensor interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for example , to account for @xmath46 within @xmath47 , we get intervals @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 for @xmath51 , respectively . of course , the branching ratio measurements could also give constraints on such a tensor interaction operator , which are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we can see the windows are very narrow because the longitudinal contribution estimated within the sm already saturate the experimental branching ratio . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well known that theoretical calculations of the branching ratios of hadronic @xmath1 decays suffer from large uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that polarization fractions could be predicted more accurately than the branching ratios , because some of hadronic uncertainties could be cancelled in the former ones . in the future , if theoretical frameworks for hadronic @xmath1 decays could achieve @xmath52 accuracy and their predictions of longitudinal branching ratio still saturate the experimental measurement , the tensor interaction scenario could be ruled out . in such a case , we need not only new physics contributions to transverse part but also new contributions destructive to longitudinal part </S>",
    "<S> . however , it would be very hard to account for the large branching ratio of @xmath53 because the similarity between the amplitudes of @xmath53 and the longitudinal amplitude of @xmath54 in the heavy @xmath55 limit .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the large transverse polarization puzzle in @xmath54 decays , which is taken as an important probe of an anomalous tensor interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a relatively weak tensor interaction could resolve the puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> if we take the coupling @xmath56 , such a solution might be a signal of new physics with tensor interaction at tev scale . with the running of @xmath1 factories babar and belle , </S>",
    "<S> we have witnessed many challenging phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , we need more accurate and complete framework to clarify whether the sm could explain those abnormal phenomena or not . + _ note added : when we finished our work , we note the paper@xcite where the same tensor operator is also studied . _ </S>"
