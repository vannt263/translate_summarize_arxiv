    "dalitz analyses are largely applied in modern high - energy experiments to study heavy flavor hadronic decays , but also to perform precise measurements of the ckm matrix elements and search for new physics .",
    "paradigmatic examples are @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the extraction of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "the extraction of @xmath3 in @xmath5 requires filtering the desired intermediate states among all the possible @xmath6 combinations , e.g. @xmath7 , @xmath8 etc .",
    "the extraction of @xmath4 in @xmath2 requires , in turn , modeling the @xmath0 amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 s - wave are characterized by broad , overlapping states : unitarity is not explicitly guaranteed by a simple sum of breit  wigner functions .",
    "in addition , independently of the nature of the @xmath11 , it is not a simple breit  wigner .",
    "the @xmath12 is a flatt - like function , and its lineshape parametrization needs precise determination of @xmath13 and @xmath14 couplings .",
    "recent analyses of cp violation in the @xmath15 channel from the beauty factories _ needed _ two _ ad hoc _ resonances to reproduce the excess of events in the @xmath14 spectrum , one at the low - mass threshold , the other at 1.1gev@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this procedure of `` effectively '' fitting data invites a word of caution on estimating the systematics of these measurements .",
    "a question then naturally arises : in the era of precise measurements , do we know sufficiently well how to deal with strong - dynamics effects in the analyses ?",
    "we have faced parametrization problems in focus and learnt that many difficulties are already known and studied in different fields , such as nuclear and intermediate - energy physics , where broad , multi - channel , overlapping resonances are treated in the _ k - matrix _",
    "formalism @xcite .",
    "the effort we have made consisted mainly in building a bridge of knowledge and language to reach the high - energy community ; our pioneering work in the charm sector might inspire future accurate studies in the beauty sector . focus dalitz plot analyses of the @xmath17 and of the @xmath18 will be discussed .",
    "the collaboration has also taken a complementary non - parametric approach to measuring the @xmath19 amplitude in the @xmath20 decay using a projective weighting technique .",
    "results will be presented .",
    "the focus collaboration has implemented the _ k - matrix _ approach in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 analyses .",
    "results and details can be found in @xcite .",
    "it was the first application of this formalism in the charm sector . in this model @xcite , the production process ,",
    "i.e , the d decay , can be viewed as consisting of an initial preparation of states , described by the _",
    "p - vector _ , which then propagates according to into the final one .",
    "the _ k - matrix _ here is the scattering matrix and is used as fixed input in our analysis .",
    "its form was inferred by the global fit to a rich set of data performed in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this formalism , beside restoring the proper dynamical features of the resonances , allows for the inclusion in @xmath0 decays of the knowledge coming from scattering experiments , i.e , an enormous amount of results and science .",
    "no re - tuning of the _ k - matrix _ parameters was needed .",
    "the confidence levels of the final fits are 3.0% and 7.7% for the @xmath23 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the results were extremely encouraging since the same _ k - matrix _ description gave a coherent picture of both two - body scattering measurements in light - quark experiments _ as well as _ charm - meson decay .",
    "this result was not obvious beforehand .",
    "furthermore , the same model was able to reproduce features of the @xmath25 dalitz plot , shown in fig.[d_proj_kmatrix ] , that would otherwise require an _",
    "@xmath11 resonance .",
    "the better treatment of the @xmath26-wave contribution provided by the _ k - matrix _ model was able reproduce the low - mass @xmath27 structure of the @xmath21 dalitz plot .",
    "this suggests that any @xmath11-like object in the @xmath0 decay should be consistent with the same @xmath11-like object measured in @xmath27 scattering .",

    "the background shape under the signal is also shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    further considerations and conclusions from the focus three - pion analysis were limited by the sample statistics , i.e. @xmath28 and @xmath29 events for @xmath23 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "we considered imperative to test the formalism at higher statistics .",
    "this was accomplished by the @xmath18 analysis .",
    "the recent focus study of the @xmath18 channel uses 53653 dalitz - plot events with a signal fraction of @xmath31 97% , and represents the highest statistics , most complete dalitz plot published analysis for this channel .",
    "invariant mass and dalitz plots are shown in fig.[signal ] .",
    "details of the analysis may be found in @xcite .",
    "an additional complication in the @xmath10 system comes from the presence in the @xmath26-wave of the two isospin states , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "although only the @xmath32 is dominated by resonances , both isospin components are involved in the decay of the @xmath21 meson into @xmath34 .",
    "a model for the decay amplitudes of the two isospin states can be constructed from the 2 @xmath35 2 _ k - matrix _ describing the @xmath32 @xmath26-wave scattering in @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( with the subscripts 1 and 2 , respectively , labelling these two channels ) , and the single - channel _ k - matrix _ describing the @xmath33 @xmath38 scattering .",
    "the _ k - matrix _ form we use as input describes the @xmath26-wave @xmath38 scattering from the lass experiment @xcite for energy above 825 mev and @xmath39 scattering from estabrooks _ et al .",

    "the total @xmath0-decay amplitude can be written as    @xmath40    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent the @xmath32 and @xmath33 decay amplitudes in the @xmath10 channel , @xmath44 runs over vector and spin-2 tensor resonances and @xmath45 are breit ",
    "wigner forms .",
    "the @xmath46 resonances should , in principle , be treated in the same _ k - matrix _ formalism .",
    "however , the contribution from the vector wave comes mainly from the @xmath47 state , which is well separated from the higher mass @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the contribution from the spin-2 wave comes from @xmath50 alone .",
    "their contributions are limited to small percentages , and , as a first approximation , they can be reasonably described by a simple sum of breit  wigners .",
    "more precise results would require a better treatment of the overlapping @xmath48 and @xmath49 resonances as well . in accordance with su(3 )",
    "expectations , the coupling of the @xmath10 system to @xmath51 is supposed to be suppressed .",
    "indeed we find little evidence that it is required .",
    "thus the @xmath52 form for the @xmath10 channel is    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the identity matrix , @xmath55 is the _ k - matrix _ for the @xmath32 @xmath26-wave scattering in @xmath10 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the corresponding phase - space matrix for the two channels @xcite and @xmath58 is the production vector in the channel @xmath44 .",
    "the form for @xmath43 is @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the single - channel scalar function describing the @xmath33 scattering , and @xmath61 is the production function into @xmath10 .",
    "the _ p - vectors _ are in general complex reflecting the fact that the initial coupling @xmath62 need not be real .",
    "their functional forms are :    @xmath63    @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66 is the complex coupling to the pole in the ` initial ' production process , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the _ k - matrix _ couplings and poles .",
    "the polynomials are expanded about @xmath71 , with corresponding to the center of the dalitz plot .",
    "the polynomial terms in each channel are chosen to have a common phase @xmath72 to limit the number of free parameters in the fit and avoid uncontrolled interference among the physical background terms .",
    "coefficients and phases of the _ p - vectors _ are the only free parameters of the fit determining the scalar components . @xmath10",
    "scattering determines the parameters of the _ k - matrix _ elements and these are fixed inputs to this @xmath0-decay analysis .",
    "free parameters for vectors and tensors are amplitudes and phases ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "table  [ tab_p_vector_nov06 ] reports our _ k - matrix _ fit results .",

    "coefficients are for the unnormalized @xmath26-wave . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath26-wave component accounts for the dominant portion of the decay @xmath77 .",
    "a significant fraction , @xmath78% , comes , as expected , from @xmath47 ; smaller contributions come from two vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 and from the tensor @xmath50 .",
    "it is conventional to quote fit fractions for each component and this is what we do .",
    "care should be taken in interpreting some of these since strong interference can occur .",
    "this is particularly apparent between contributions in the same - spin partial wave .",
    "while the total @xmath26-wave fraction is a sensitive measure of its contribution to the dalitz plot , the separate fit fractions for @xmath32 and @xmath33 must be treated with care .",
    "the broad @xmath32 @xmath26-wave component inevitably interferes strongly with the slowly varying @xmath33 @xmath26-wave , as seen for instance in @xcite .",
    "fit results on the projections are shown in fig .  [ fit_kmatrix_proj ] .",
    "the fit @xmath79/d.o.f is 1.27 corresponding to a confidence level of 1.2% .",
    "our adaptive binning scheme is shown is fig  [ fit_adapt ] if the @xmath33 component is removed from the fit , the @xmath79/d.o.f worsens to 1.54 , corresponding to a confidence level of @xmath80 .        these results can be compared with those obtained in the effective isobar model , consisting in a sum of breit wigners , which can serve as the standard for fit quality .",
    "two _ ad hoc _ scalar resonances are required , of mass @xmath81 and @xmath82 and width @xmath83 and @xmath84 mev/@xmath85 respectively to reproduce the data and reach a @xmath79/d.o.f is 1.17 , corresponding to a c.l of 6.8% .",
    "a detailed discussion of the results and the systematics can be found in @xcite .",
    "a feature of the _ k - matrix _ amplitude analysis is that it allows an indirect phase measurement of the separate isospin components : it is this phase variation with isospin @xmath32 that should be compared with the same @xmath32 lass phase , extrapolated from 825 gev down to threshold according to chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this is done in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ phase_tot_compa ] . in this model",
    "@xcite the _ p - vector _ allows for a phase variation accounting for the interaction with the third particle in the process of resonance formation .",
    "it so happens that the dalitz fit gives a nearly constant production phase .",
    "the two phases in fig .  [ phase_tot_compa]b ) have the same behaviour up to @xmath31 1.1 gev . however , approaching @xmath56 threshold , effects of inelasticity and differing final state interactions start to appear . the difference between the phases in fig .",

    "this means that possible three - body interaction effects , not accounted for in the _ k - matrix _ parametrization , play a marginal role .",
    "the _ k - matrix _ form used in this analysis generates the _ s - matrix _ pole @xmath87 gev .",
    "any more distant pole than @xmath88 is not reliably determined as this simple _ k - matrix _ expression does not have the required analyticity properties .",
    "however , our _ k - matrix _ representation fits along the real energy axis inputs on scattering data and chiral perturbation theory in close agreement with those used in @xcite , which locates the @xmath89 with a mass of @xmath90 mev and a width of @xmath91 mev by careful continuation . these pole parameters are quite different from those implied by the simple isobar fits .",
    "we have thus shown that whatever @xmath89 is revealed by our @xmath92 results , it is the same as that found in scattering data .",
    "while making the effort of refining the amplitude formalism , focus identified the @xmath93 as an ideal case to apply the projective weighting technique developed in the semi - leptonic sector @xcite to the hadronic decays , with no need to assume specific breit - wigner resonances , forms for mass dependent widths , hadronic form factors or zemach momentum factors .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the old e687 dalitz plot analysis @xcite concluded that the observed @xmath94 dalitz plot could be adequately described by just three resonant contributions : @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "although @xmath97 is an important contribution , the @xmath98 is a very narrow resonance that can be substantially removed through a cut on @xmath99 , i.e @xmath100 1050 mev / c@xmath16 .",
    "since there is no overlap of the @xmath98 band with the @xmath101 and most of the kinematically allowed @xmath102 region , there is a relatively small loss of information from the anti-@xmath98 cut ; of course careful systematic evaluation for residual @xmath103 contributions and bias are performed . in the absence of the @xmath104 resonances , we can write the decay amplitude in terms of @xmath105 and the helicity decay angle @xmath106 thus @xmath107 where @xmath108 are the wigner d - matrices describing the amplitude for a @xmath19 system of angular momentum @xmath109 to simultaneously have 0 angular momentum along its helicity axis and the @xmath19 decay axis . this technique is an intrinsically one - dimensional analysis . the decay intensity assuming , for simplicity , that only s and p - waves are present , is    @xmath110    the approach is to divide @xmath111 into twenty evenly spaced angular bins .",
    "let @xmath112 be a vector whose 20 components give the population in data for each of the 20 @xmath111 bins . here",
    "@xmath113 specifies the @xmath114 bin .",

    "we then use a weighting technique to fit the bin populations in the data to the form @xmath119 .",
    "when including the d - wave as well , the results appear just as five weighted histograms in the @xmath116 mass , as in fig",

    "this analysis reveals once more , how subtle the inclusion of the broad s - wave resonances in charm dalitz analysis can be .",

    "having found no evidence , limits were calculated .",
    "the @xmath130 production cross section was normalized to @xmath131 and @xmath132 because the reconstructed decay modes of the particles @xmath133 and @xmath134 are very similar , in terms of topology and energy release , to the signal .",

    "analogously the upper limit was calculated for the @xmath137 candidate with respect to the @xmath138 obtaining @xmath139 0.007 ( 0.019 ) for a natural width of 0 ( 15 ) mev/@xmath85 .",
    "dalitz - plot analysis represents a unique , powerful and promising tool for physics studies within and beyond the standard model ; however to perform such sophisticate analyses , we need to model the strong interaction effects .",
    "focus has performed pilot studies in the charm sector through the _ k - matrix _ formalism and has started an effort to identify channels where non - parametric approaches can be undertaken .",
