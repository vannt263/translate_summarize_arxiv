    "missing spectral data in many branches of physics limits the applicability of analysis tools and devices and assessment techniques .",
    "these branches include but are not limited to optics , geophysics , electromagnetics and communication technology @xcite .",
    "although shorter wavelengths are more vulnerable to attenuation compared to longer wavelengths , longer wavelengths can also be lost during their propagation in medium therefore any spectral component of a signal may be lost @xcite .",
    "different approaches are proposed to deal with problems that occur due to missing spectral data .",
    "few of these approaches can be summarized as below : a modification of the singular spectrum analysis that analyzes time series with missing data is proposed in @xcite .",
    "the missing data recovery via a nonparametric iterative adaptive approach and nonparametric spectral analysis with missing data via the expectation maximization algorithms are two other tools used in literature to overcome this problem @xcite .",
    "the method of marquardt is applied to a single @xmath3-parameter equation , which models known long - wavelength loss mechanisms for rapid and accurate modeling of the spectral - loss profiles of lightguide fibers , in @xcite . a compressive sensing ( cs ) based approach for stationary and non - stationary stochastic process power spectrum estimation with missing data is recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "it remains an open question what the stable self - localized solutions would be in a nonlinear field with missing spectral data . to overcome this problem",
    ", we propose a novel numerical scheme that can attain the stable sparse self - localized solutions of the nonlinear system of equations with many missing spectral data .",
    "we test the applicability of the proposed method on a 1d schrdinger - like equation which is widely used as a model equation in optics , hydrodynamics , quantum mechanics , bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "the proposed method utilizes iterations in the fourier domain for a far fewer number of spectral components ( @xmath0 ) than classical versions of the petviashivili s method or spectral renormalization method ( srm ) with higher number of spectral components ( @xmath1 ) . after the converge criteria",
    "is achieved for @xmath0 components , the signal with @xmath1 components can be reconstructed from @xmath0 components by the @xmath2 minimization technique of the compressive sampling . the name proposed for this method is compressive spectral renormalization ( csrm ) method . compared to srm , the main advantage of the csrm is that , it is capable of finding the sparse self - localized states of the evolution equation(s ) with far fewer spectral data .",
    "for example for fiber optical communications , where some data is lost during the propagation of the optical pulse or considering memory and time constraints they may be intentionally ignored , csrm can be used to find self localized states of the system of equations studied .",
    "we discuss the implementation of the proposed method and its advantages and limitations using single and dual soliton solutions of the nls and an nls - like equation with a potential used to model the photorefractive lattice solitons and with saturable nonlinearity .",
    "self - localized solutions of many nonlinear systems can be found by various computational techniques such as shooting , self - consistency and relaxation @xcite .",
    "another method known is the petviashvili s method which is based on transforming the governing nonlinear equation into fourier space , as in the case of general fourier spectral schemes @xcite , and determining a convergence factor according to the degree of a single nonlinear term @xcite .",
    "this method was introduced by petviashvili and applied to kadomtsev - petviashvili ( 2d korteweg de - vries ) equation @xcite .",
    "later , it has been developed and applied to many other systems which model many different phenomena such as lattice vortices , dark and gray solitons @xcite .",
    "since petviashvili s method works well for nonlinearities with fixed homogeneity only , a novel spectral renormalization method ( srm ) is proposed in @xcite which is capable of finding the localized solutions in waveguides with different types of nonlinearities .",
    "the srm essentially transforms the governing equation into fourier space and couples it to a nonlinear integral equation which is basically an energy conservation principle for the iterations in the fourier space @xcite .",
    "this coupling makes the initial conditions to converge to the self - localized solutions of the nonlinear system studied @xcite .",
    "srm is spectrally efficient , it can be applied to many different physical problems with different higher - order nonlinearities and is easy to implement @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we give a brief review of the srm considering a 1d nls - like equation as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the propagation direction of optical pulse , @xmath6 is the transverse coordinate , @xmath7 denotes the imaginary number and @xmath8 is complex amplitude of the optical field @xcite . using the ansatz , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 shows the soliton eigenvalue , the nls - like equation becomes @xmath11 furthermore the 1d fourier transform of @xmath12 can be obtained by @xmath13 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\eta(x ) \\exp[i(kx)]dx \\label{eq03}\\ ] ] for a zero optical potential , @xmath14 , the 1d fourier transform of eq .",

    "the procedure of obtaining self - localized solutions of a nonlinear system by the coupled equation analysis reviewed and summarized above is known as the spectral renormalization method ( srm ) @xcite .",

    "compressive sampling ( cs ) is an efficient sampling technique which exploits the sparsity of the signal for its reconstruction by using far fewer samples than the requirements of the shannon - nyquist sampling theorem @xcite . since its introduction to the scientific community",
    ", cs has been intensively studied as a mathematical tool in applied mathematics and physics and currently sampling in various engineering devices such as the single pixel video cameras and efficient a - d converters is performed using cs .",
    "we give a very brief summary of the cs in this section and refer the reader to @xcite for a comprehensive analysis .",
    "let @xmath8 be a @xmath32-sparse signal with @xmath1 elements .",
    "this means that only @xmath32 of the @xmath1 elements of @xmath8 are nonzero . using orthonormal basis transformations with transformation a matrix @xmath33",
    ", @xmath8 can be represented in transformed domain in terms of the basis functions .",
    "typical orthogonal transformations used in the literature include but are not limited to fourier , wavelet or discrete cosine transforms ( dct ) . using the orthogonal transformation it is possible to express the signal as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the coefficient vector .",
    "discarding the zero coefficients and keeping the non - zero coefficients of @xmath8 , one can obtain @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the signal with non - zero entries .",
    "cs algorithm states that a @xmath32-sparse signal @xmath8 which has @xmath1 elements can exactly be reconstructed from @xmath38 measurements with a very high probability . in here",
    "@xmath39 is a positive constant and @xmath40 is the mutual coherence between the sensing @xmath41 and transform bases @xmath33 @xcite . taking @xmath0 projections randomly and using the sensing matrix @xmath41 the sampled signal can be written as @xmath42 .",
    "therefore the cs problem can be rewritten as @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "therefore among all signals that satisfy the given constraints above , the @xmath45 minimization solution of the cs problem is @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath2 minimization is only one of the tools that can be used for finding the solution of this optimization problem .",
    "the sparse signals can also be recovered using other optimization techniques such as the re - weighted @xmath47 minimization or greedy pursuit algorithms @xcite .",
    "details of the cs can be seen in @xcite .      in a classical srm",
    "let @xmath1 be the number of the spectral components used to represent a self - localized solution of an evolution equation(s ) .",
    "first we select @xmath0 spectral components at random , where @xmath48 , and apply srm for those @xmath0 components .",
    "the random selection of the number @xmath0 needs to be done carefully depending on width of the @xmath32-sparse self - localized state since @xmath0 needs to satisfy the @xmath49 condition of the cs .",
    "starting from the initial conditions , iterations are performed for obtaining the convergent self - localized states for @xmath0 components .",
    "after the converge criteria is achieved for @xmath0 components , @xmath1 component signal is reconstructed from @xmath0 components by using the @xmath2 minimization technique of the cs .",
    "this method can be named as compressive spectral renormalization ( csrm ) method .",
    "the advantage of the csrm is that , it is capable of finding the sparse self - localized states of the evolution equation(s ) with @xmath50 spectral data missing . in practice , for example in a typical photonic crystal , only few of the spectral data would be expected to be lost , if any , during the propagation of the optical pulse .",
    "in that case , csrm would be used to find the self - localized states of the system with the same accuracy of the srm .",
    "also one can intentionally undersample the sparse optical signal with monochromators are only used for selected components , but the accurate self - localized state can still be reconstructed using csrm using only those selected components .",
    "it is possible to make the selection of @xmath0 components deterministically as well , but in that case cs solution would produce some replicated patterns in the solution which need to be filtered in that case @xcite .",
    "a similar procedure based on cs which exploits the sparsity of the simulated signal is proposed for general spectral schemes in @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the main advantage of using cs in a spectral scheme is to improve the numerical simulation time and computer memory requirements of the sparse signals .",
    "csrm can also be computationally advantageous depending on how large @xmath50 is and the number of iteration steps needed to obtain a convergent solution but for a more general srm this advantage would be more clear . if the ansatz @xmath51 , where @xmath52 shows a propagation distance dependent soliton eigenvalue , would be used , then finding the self - localized state at any @xmath5 would be necessary and thus csrm would also be computationally very advantageous while there is negligible accuracy difference between csrm and srm .",
    "although sparsity property of the self - localized states of the model nls - like equation in the physical domain is used and random selection of @xmath0 components are done in fourier space , for a state which is sparse in fourier domain random samples can be taken in the physical domain and the csrm can be applied in a pseudospectral manner .",
    "additionally the csrm method can be extended to other spectral methods , such as wavelets , dcts , chebyshev and legendre polynomials , just to name a few .",
