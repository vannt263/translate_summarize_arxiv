    "power quality control is one of the major concerns for power delivery systems to function reliably , and it requires measurements of voltage characteristics , among which the frequency measurement is a non - trivial task due to the presence of voltage sags and voltage harmonics mostly caused by nonlinear loads @xcite . in the particular case of three - phase power systems , the clarke s @xmath0 , @xmath1 transformation is widely used as the preprocessing method to create a complex - valued single - phase signal from the real - valued three - phase signals @xcite , so that traditional complex - valued spectrum estimation methods can be applied , such as the mvdr method or the recently proposed iterative mvdr ( i - mvdr ) method @xcite . to improve the resolution",
    ", we can further apply the subspace methods and one representative example is the music method @xcite .",
    "however , all the zero sequence voltages will be cancelled out in the complex - valued signal and hence can not be detected .",
    "although these harmonic voltages would simply be blocked by a delta transformer , they will add up in the neutral , leading to overheating in the transformer and potential fire hazards @xcite . to detect these harmonics , as well as harmonics of other orders ,",
    "we propose a quaternion - valued model and all the traditional spectrum estimation methods can be extended to this domain , such as mvdr and music .",
    "we will show that harmonics of all orders will be reserved in the resulting quaternion - valued signal and will be detected by relevant estimation methods .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "a brief review of the complex - valued model is presented in section ii .",
    "our quaternion - valued model is proposed in section iii , together with the fourier analysis and the mvdr and music - like estimation algorithms .",
    "simulation results are provided in section iv and conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "we consider the following discrete - time balanced three - phase power system in the presence of @xmath2 harmonic distortions : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the amplitudes of the harmonic signals , @xmath5 is the fundamental ( angular ) frequency , @xmath6 is the sampling interval , @xmath7 is the signal phase , and @xmath8 are the measurement noise .    traditionally , the three - phase signals will be converted to a complex - valued single - phase signal via the clarke s @xmath9 transformation .",
    "firstly , the three - phase signals are mixed into two parts , namely @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 @xmath13 then these two parts will be merged as a complex - valued signal @xmath14 .    with this complex - valued signal",
    ", we can exploit the mvdr spectrum to locate the frequencies , and it is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hermitian - transpose operation , @xmath17 is the covariance matrix of dimension @xmath18 , and @xmath19^\\mathrm t\\ ] ] is the frequency sweeping vector .",
    "we can also use the music spectrum which is expressed as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the euclidean norm , @xmath22 represents the noise subspace and comprises the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix @xmath17 which are corresponding to the @xmath23 smallest eigenvalues , where @xmath23 is assumed to be known or can be estimated using the information theory methods @xcite .    in practice",
    ", the covariance @xmath17 needs to be updated and estimated from the average of samples , @xmath24 where @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of observations .      in detail , @xmath27 is composed of complex - domain harmonic signals that can be divided into two categories plus noise , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the summation of all positive sequence voltages , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the summation of all negative sequence voltages , @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes the largest integer not greater than @xmath34 .",
    "all the zero sequence voltages have been cancelled out .",
    "zero sequence voltages of the same order are cophasial in the three voltage channels and will be eliminated since both rows of the transformation matrix @xmath35 are zero - mean vectors .    to solve this problem",
    ", we propose our quaternion - valued approach in the next section .",
    "we construct a quaternion - valued signal from the three - phase signals as @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the three imaginary units of the quaternion algebra which are constrained by @xcite @xmath38 this quaternion - valued signal contains quaternion - domain harmonic signals that belong to three categories @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 plus noise , @xmath42 where @xmath39 is the summation of all the positive sequence voltages , @xmath43\\\\ & \\quad-\\frac{\\imath+\\jmath+k}{\\sqrt{3}}\\sin[(3p-2)(\\omega nt_s+\\phi)]\\big\\}\\\\ & = \\sum_{p=1}^{\\lfloor\\frac{h+2}{3}\\rfloor}\\frac{2\\imath-\\jmath - k}{2}v_{3p-2}e^{-\\frac{\\imath+\\jmath+k}{\\sqrt{3}}(3p-2)(\\omega nt_s+\\phi)}\\ ; , \\end{split } \\label{3p-2}\\ ] ] @xmath40 is the summation of all the negative sequence voltages , @xmath44\\\\ & \\quad+\\frac{\\imath+\\jmath+k}{\\sqrt{3}}\\sin[(3p-1)(\\omega nt_s+\\phi)]\\big\\}\\\\ & = \\sum_{p=1}^{\\lfloor\\frac{h+1}{3}\\rfloor}\\frac{2\\imath-\\jmath - k}{2}v_{3p-1}e^{\\frac{\\imath+\\jmath+k}{\\sqrt{3}}(3p-1)(\\omega nt_s+\\phi)}\\ ; , \\end{split } \\label{3p-1}\\ ] ] @xmath41 is the summation of all the zero sequence voltages , @xmath45\\\\ & = \\sum_{p=1}^{\\lfloor\\frac{h}{3}\\rfloor}v_{3p}\\frac{\\imath+\\jmath+k}{2}\\big(e^{\\frac{\\imath+\\jmath+k}{\\sqrt{3}}3p(\\omega nt_s+\\phi)}\\\\ & + e^{-\\frac{\\imath+\\jmath+k}{\\sqrt{3}}3p(\\omega nt_s+\\phi)}\\big)\\;. \\end{split } \\label{3p}\\ ] ] hence all the harmonic signals will be reserved in the quaternion - valued signal",
    ". we may observe from ( [ 3p-2])([3p ] ) that the frequencies of the harmonic signals have been mapped into the frequencies of the quaternion - valued signal associated with the @xmath46 axis ( see fig .",
    "axis , title=\"fig:\",width=211 ] +     +    then we can adopt the mvdr spectrum in ( [ mvdr ] ) and the music spectrum in ( [ music ] ) by substituting the frequency sweeping vector as @xmath47^\\mathrm t\\;.\\ ] ]    the frequencies detected in the spectrum are either the original real - domain angular frequencies or their additive inverses , namely    1 .",
    "if a peak is detected in the spectrum in the absence of its additive inverse , it corresponds to a positive or negative sequence voltage signal and this spectrum peak indicates its angular frequency or its additive inverse .",
    "if two `` mirrored '' peaks are detected in the spectrum , they correspond to a zero sequence voltage signal and they indicate the signal s angular frequency and its additive inverse , respectively .",
    "in this section , we provide some numerical examples to illustrate the performance of the proposed quaternion model . in all experiments ,",
    "the fundamental frequency is 50 hz , the sampling frequency is @xmath48 khz , the initial phase is @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "there exist a second - order and a third - order harmonic signals , both set to be 6% in amplitude .    in the first experiment",
    ", we test the capability of the two modelings .",
    "the mvdr and music spectra of the quaternion- and complex - valued models are plotted in fig .",
    "2 , where snr @xmath52 db .",
    "it can be observed that the proposed model is able to detect all the harmonic signals , namely 50 hz ( the fundamental frequency ) , @xmath53 hz ( the second - order harmonic ) , and @xmath54150 hz ( the third - order harmonic ) , while the complex - valued model fails at the third - order harmonic frequency .    in the second experiment ,",
    "we test the accuracy of relevant algorithms",
    ". the estimation errors ( averaged via 300 monte carlo simulation runs ) of the quaternion- and complex - valued mvdr and music algorithms are plotted in fig .",
    "3 , where the snr value varies from 25 to 45 db . we can see that all the algorithms have similar estimation accuracy .",
    "we have presented a quaternion - valued model as an alternative preprocessing approach to convert the three - phase signals into a single - phase system . compared with the clarke s transformation",
    ", the proposed model can additionally detect the zero sequence voltages .",
    "simulated results show that the proposed model can detect all - order voltage harmonics effectively , while sharing similar estimation accuracy with the complex - valued model .",
