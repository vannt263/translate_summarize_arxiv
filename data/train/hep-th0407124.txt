    "vector modes of the geometry may have interesting phenomenological implications .",
    "for instance , as argued long ago by wassermann @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the existence of large - scale vorticity ( sometimes connected with a large - scale magnetic field ) may have relevant implications for the origin of global rotation of spiral galaxies .",
    "the possible existence of primordial vorticity has been the subject of various investigations .",
    "harrison @xcite ( see also @xcite for a complementary perspective ) noticed that if vorticity is present over sufficiently large length scales in a plasma of ions and electrons , magnetic fields can be induced over scales comparable with the typical scale of the vorticity .",
    "the dynamical origin of primordial vorticity has been , since then , a subject of debate . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested that cosmic strings with small scale structure may be responsible for the dynamical origin of vorticity .",
    "the dynamical friction between cosmic strings and matter may also be responsible for further sources of vorticity @xcite .    in spite of the fact that the considerations quoted so far may indeed produce large - scale vorticity , it is useful to take another approach and consider the possibility that , thanks to the pumping action of the gravitational field , the vector fluctuations of the geometry will be amplified , providing , at some later epoch , the initial condition for the evolution of the rotational fluctuations of the fluid . the motivation of the present investigation is to discuss the evolution of vector modes of the geometry in the case of a bouncing background .",
    "as is known , the ten - dimensional degrees of freedom of a four - dimensional metric can be decomposed , with respect to three - dimensional rotations , into four scalar modes , two tensor modes ( described by a divergenceless and traceless rank - two symmetric tensor in three dimensions ) , and four vector degrees of freedom ( described by two divergenceless vectors in three dimensions ) . out of these ten degrees of freedom",
    ", four can be fixed by a choice of coordinate system . while the tensor modes are invariant under infinitesimal gauge transformations , the scalar and vector modes are not .    while this work was in progress , battefeld and brandenberger @xcite argued that it is not unlikely that vector modes of the geometry may be amplified in the case of four - dimensional curvature bounces as the ones provided by cyclic / ekpyrotic scenarios @xcite or in the context of the pre - big bang scenario @xcite .",

    "they found a growing - vector zero mode and correctly pointed out that the specific fate of such a mode is rather sensitive to the detailed dynamics of the bounce .",
    "there are , in principle , different bouncing dynamics that can be analysed .",
    "the simplest case is the one of a four - dimensional background without fluid sources but with a scalar degree of freedom ( the dilaton ) . in this case , during the contraction the vector zero mode increases , but as will be argued in specific examples , its fate depends upon the dynamics of the curvature bounce and , in all the analytical examples reported in the present paper , it matches with a decaying mode after the bounce .",
    "a similar situation also arises , also in four dimensions but in the presence of fluid sources and together with a dilatonic background .    in the multidimensional case",
    "the situation becomes increasingly interesting .",
    "there more scalar and vector modes arise and their quantum mechanical fluctuations can be amplified .    for the sake of completeness , even if the scalar modes of the geometry are not the subject of the present investigation , we want to mention that curvature bounces have been the subject of various debates concerning the fate of the scalar fluctuations of the geometry ( see @xcite for a partial list of references ) .",
