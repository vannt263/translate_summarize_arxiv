    "<S> the doubly - connected polygonal geometry of planar graphene rings is found to bring forth topological configurations for accessing nontrivial relativistic quantum field ( rqf ) theory models that carry beyond the constant - mass dirac - fermion theory . </S>",
    "<S> these include generation of sign - alternating masses , solitonic excitations , and charge fractionization . </S>",
    "<S> the work integrates a rqf lagrangian formulation with numerical tight - binding aharonov - bohm electronic spectra and the generalized position - dependent - mass dirac equation . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to armchair graphene rings ( agrgs ) with pure metallic arms , certain classes of agrgs with semiconducting arms , as well as with mixed metallic - semiconducting ones , are shown to exhibit properties of one - dimensional nontrivial topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> this further reveals an alternative direction for realizing a graphene - based nontrivial topological insulator through the manipulation of the honeycomb lattice geometry , without a spin - orbit contribution . </S>"
