    "the classic derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) theory @xcite predicts that an isolated pair of charged colloidal spheres in an aqueous salt solution interacts via a repulsive yukawa potential at large separations , a prediction that has recently been confirmed by direct experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "however , in nature colloidal particles usually do not occur simply as pairs , but rather in form of suspensions .",
    "then the dlvo pair potential does not always provide a valid description of the intercolloidal interactions as becomes clear from the following considerations .",
    "the dlvo potential is an effective colloid - colloid potential , obtained after integrating out the microionic degrees of freedom ; it is governed by the density distribution of the ionic fluid between two interacting colloids . however , when more than two colloids are present , as it is the case in colloidal suspensions , then this density distribution can be sensitively influenced by other colloids in the neighborhood , i.e. , by both the presence of the fixed charges on the colloidal surfaces and the exclusion of electrolytic solution from the volume occupied by the colloid .",
    "because of these confinement and polarization effects , colloidal interactions in suspensions in principle are non - additive , that is , the total potential energy can not be written as a sum of simple pair - interactions .",
    "the implications of this interesting many - body aspect of charge - stabilized colloidal suspensions have been addressed by various authors .",
    "linse @xcite studied asymmetric two - component electrolytes ( charge asymmetry 1:20 ) within the primitive model and explored pair- and triplet - correlations among colloidal particles in concentrated suspensions .",
    "he compared his data with the results of a simulation of an effective one - component system , consisting only of colloids interacting via effective pair - potentials , chosen such that the pair - correlations in the original two - component system and in the reference one - component system are identical .",
    "although in general rather similar triplet correlation functions were obtained , considerable differences became visible at small distances , pointing to the existence of many - body forces . in a more direct way",
    ", three - body forces have been analyzed by lwen and allahyarov @xcite using primitive model simulations in a triangular geometry of colloids .",
    "interestingly enough , these three - body forces are attractive , representing a substantial correction to the repulsive pair - forces , a finding that has been corroborated by recent primitive model @xcite and poisson - boltzmann simulations @xcite , see also @xcite .    the present work addresses the question how three- and higher - order body forces affect the melting behavior of colloidal crystals .",
    "starting from crystalline configurations , we compute the mean - square displacement of colloids about their lattice site and use lindemann s rule to estimate the solid - liquid phase - boundaries .",
    "the simulation technique we use , has been suggested by fushiki @xcite ; it combines a poisson - boltzmann field description for the microions with a brownian dynamics simulation for the macroionic colloids , an approach which ensures that many - body interactions between the colloids are fully included . in order to identify many - body effects we have to contrast the phase - diagram resulting from these simulations to the predictions based on the established description of colloidal suspensions in terms of pairwise yukawa potentials",
    "this requires a procedure by which we can map our original many - body non - linear system onto an effective linear pairwise additive yukawa system .",
    "this is done here by calculating effective pair - forces between colloids which are then fitted to yukawa pair - potentials .",
    "our main result is that the melting line of a colloidal system with purely pair - wise additive potentials is shifted towards the crystalline side of the phase - diagram if many - body forces are added . in view of the fact that three - body forces are already known to be attractive ,",
    "this result is what one would expect : for a colloidal crystal whose stability results from repulsive pair - forces , adding attractive triplet forces should have a destabilizing effect on the crystal so that it melts earlier than it would without these three - body forces .",
    "we will however see that it is not straightforward to spot the many - body forces as being responsible for this effect .",
    "after some general remarks in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] on many body interactions in colloidal systems , we will give in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] a description of the system and the simulation methods used .",
    "[ sec4 ] is then devoted to a presentation of our effective force calculations in colloidal fcc and bcc crystals , followed by sec .",

    "this , together with the results from sec .",

    "[ sec7 ] contains a summary of our results and the general conclusion .",
    "there exists a bijective one - to - one mapping between a unique pair potential @xmath0 and the pair correlation function @xmath1 at the density @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "that is , even in systems where the true interaction potential contains a strong three - body contribution @xmath3 , one can interpret the pair correlation function in terms of ( now effective ) pair - potentials @xmath0 .",
    "these effective potentials are to be distinguished from the true pair - potential @xmath4 .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath2 , @xmath0 reads @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and where @xmath7 is that radial distribution function which is based on the true pair potential @xmath4 alone .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) states in essence that the three - body interactions can be integrated out , and that the resulting effective pair - potential becomes state - dependent . in other words , taking eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) as a model pair - potential in a system with pair - wise interactions only , one can , at low density , calculate the correct pair - correlation function for the true system , consisting of particles interacting via @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is the key to an understanding of a recent experiment in 2d suspensions of charged colloids @xcite which being intimately related to the subject of this paper , we briefly summarize in the following . in this experiment digital video microscopy",
    "has been used to systematically investigate the effective pair - potentials @xmath0 as a function of the colloid densities @xmath2 . at relatively low densities , potentials very close to yukawa form",
    "have been observed , just as standard dlvo theory predicts . for increasing density , however , the measured potentials were yukawa - like only at very short distances but showed clear and systematic deviations from the yukawa form at larger distances . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) it is seen that a density - dependence of @xmath0 reveals the existence of many - body interactions , in particular three - body interactions . according to @xcite three - body forces between charged colloids",
    "are attractive , so @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) should be smaller than @xmath4 in the distance regime where @xmath3 is appreciable .",
    "this has indeed been observed in @xcite .",
    "another observation made in this experiment has been that the radial distance where the measured @xmath0 started to show deviations from @xmath4 was correlated with the mean colloid - colloid distance @xmath9 ( in 2d ) .",
    "these observations show that three - body interactions between the colloids in the suspension are non - negligible and that they indeed seem to be attractive as predicted in @xcite",
    ". a clearer idea of the experimental findings is given by the following interpretation : two colloids , a and b , separated by a distance @xmath10 , will behave as if they were in isolation , i.e. the interaction is determined solely by the microions and the pair - potential is yukawa - like .",
    "however , if @xmath11 , then it is very likely that there is a third colloidal particle , c , near the line joining the two interacting colloids a and b. this third particle has a threefold effect on the interaction between the particles a and b. first , there is a confinement effect ; the electrolyte solution is excluded from the volume occupied by particle c. secondly , colloids are usually made of materials that have a much lower dielectric constant than that of the aqueous solvent ; electric field lines will then also be excluded from the volume of particle c. and , finally , the colloids are charged ; thus the charges of particle c will affect the microionic charge distribution between the two interacting colloids a and b. all three effects result in a pair - interaction between a and b that will depend on the position of particle c. this can be taken into account by choosing a description either in terms of density - dependent effective pair - potentials or in terms of density - independent pair - potentials plus many - body interactions .",
    "the effect of particle c on the interaction between a and b is the stronger the nearer c is to the joining line between a and b , and certainly strongest , if c lies directly on this line . in @xcite , this coaxial geometry has been considered , and it has been found that the three - body potential equals a considerable fraction ( up to 90% for almost touching colloidal spheres ) of the negative of the pair - potential between the two outer particles ( particle a and b ) .",
    "this means that the middle colloid essentially shields ( or  screens  ) the two outer ones from each other ; it blocks the direct ( repulsive ) pair interaction between them . in other words",
    ", the triplet interaction describes , to lowest order , the screening of pair interactions due to additional macroions .",
    "one may say that the interaction between two colloids at large distances ( @xmath11 ) is screened by both microions and macroions , while it is screened just by the microions if @xmath10 ; so the effective @xmath12 in the former case is larger than in the latter case because the ionic strength is higher when macro- and microions are counted in comparison to the case where only the microions are taken into account @xcite .",
    "because the screening mechanism involving macro- and microions is much more efficient , the pair interaction between colloids in suspension will decay much faster than the interaction between an isolated pair of colloids .",
    "in fact , it is just this cross - over from a microion - dominated to a macroion - dominated screening that has been observed in the experiment in @xcite , and the distance where this happens was indeed roughly given by @xmath13 , beyond which value the effective pair - potentials decayed so rapidly to zero , as if they were cut off .",
    "such a  cut - off  like behavior , caused by macroion screening , is also found in the effective force curves we present in sec .",
    ". it also plays a decisive role when in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we try to understand the solid - liquid phase behavior of colloidal suspensions with truncated and density - dependent effective pair - potentials , chosen to model the effect of many - body interactions .",
    "in rare - gas systems it has long been known that a description in terms of pair - potentials is not strictly valid because the interaction between two particles is again disturbed by the presence of a close third particle @xcite . in these systems , one usually describes the interaction between the atoms by combining a pair - potential with the so - called axilrod - teller triple - dipole potential @xcite .",
    "mainly the effect of this additional many - body potential on the pair - correlations functions has been studied for krypton @xcite , argon @xcite and xenon @xcite .",
    "most of these papers are large - scale computer simulations , including the classic work of barker et al .",
    "@xcite , others present perturbation @xcite and integral - equation theories @xcite in which the pair - correlation functions is calculated from the ornstein - zernike equation using a closure that involves the effective pair - potential from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . concerning the gas - liquid equilibrium ,",
    "the effect of the axilrod - teller interaction potential has been studied for argon in @xcite , where only a moderate difference to the pairwise interactive case was found .",
    "contrary to these rare - gas fluids , where one is simply stuck with the interaction dictated by the electronic structure of the atoms , the interactions between charged colloidal particles can be adjusted by adding salt to the electrolyte . specifically , three - body interactions between the colloids can be switched - off just by adding salt .",
    "this allows to investigate experimentally how the behavior of a suspension of charged colloids depends on their interactions .",
    "the possibility of tuning the interactions in an experiment makes colloidal suspensions a system that is ideally suited for studying many - body effects .",
    "the salt concentration thus is an important quantity in the following discussion .",
    "it is best specified by means of the inverse debye screening length @xmath14 .",
    "this is also a natural measure for the interaction range of effective colloidal interactions , as it gives the thickness of the spherical double - layer around a single isolated colloidal sphere .",
    "comparing @xmath14 to the mean colloid - colloid distance @xmath13 , we can estimate when we expect three - body interactions to be important .",
    "if two spherical double - layers overlap , the screening of the colloidal charges becomes incomplete and the charge distributions on the colloids involved begin to interact . if the colloid density is low , i.e. if @xmath15 , it is obvious that such an overlap will almost always occur for pairs of colloids only . at high colloid densities",
    ", however , i.e. if @xmath16 , there is a high probability that more than one other colloid is within the range of the double - layer @xmath14 around any colloidal particle .",
    "many - body forces between the colloids thus become important under low - salt conditions and/or at high colloid densities @xcite .",
    "unlike in rare - gas systems , the effect of triplet interactions @xcite on the phase - behavior of charged colloids has not received much attention .",
    "@xcite have used their simulated three - body potentials to calculate the densities of the coexisting phases by simple van - der - waals theories for the solutions and the colloidal crystals .",
    "they studied colloidal systems in monovalent electrolyte solutions , with and without triplet forces , and found only small differences .",
    "however , they investigated systems at rather high salt concentrations ( @xmath17 m ) while as pointed out above , the physics of charged colloidal suspensions becomes special only at low - added salt @xcite .",
    "the interesting features of phase equilibria in charged colloidal suspensions at low - salt conditions have also been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "linse et al . , in a series of papers @xcite , have explored by primitive model simulations the structure , phase - behavior and thermodynamics of a model system consisting of charged colloids and point counterions ( with up to 80 counterions per colloid ) ; these authors concentrated mainly on a possible gas - liquid phase - coexistence , but not on the crystallization behavior of their system .",
    "the considerations made above show that in the presence of many - body interactions , the effective pair - potential becomes density - dependent . that a density - dependence of the pair - potential can produce a van - der - waals like instability even in fluids with purely repulsive pair potentials has been shown for a colloidal system by dijkstra et al.@xcite .",
    "it can also lead to a second liquid - liquid phase separation in systems that already show a gas - liquid phase - coexistence @xcite . a broad discussion of density - dependent pair - potentials with many illustrative examples of typical soft - matter systems is given by louis @xcite , including recent theoretical studies of coarse graining of polymers as soft colloids @xcite .",
    "louis points out that the effective density - dependent pair potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , though reproducing the correct pair - structure , will not generate the correct virial pressure .",
    "the implications of this inconsistency for the thermodynamics of the fluid is considered in @xcite .",
    "this shows the importance of investigations like ours taking full account of the many - body nature of colloidal interactions .",

    "constant - charge boundary conditions are assumed for all @xmath37 colloid surfaces .",

    "the suspension is assumed to be separated from the reservoir by a semi - permeable membrane , through which solvent molecules and microions can pass , but not colloidal particles .",
    "this leads to an imbalance in the osmotic pressure across the membrane .",
    "the equilibrium between the suspension and the salt reservoir is referred to as donnan equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the effective average salt concentration @xmath38 in the suspension is not the same as the reservoir salt concentration @xmath39 , but is a function of the physical parameters of the system and can be calculated , e.g. , in the pb cell model @xcite . here",
    ", we can compute @xmath38 from the total number of microions , obtained by integrating the microionic density distribution , @xmath40 , over @xmath29 . since the actual salt concentration in the system , @xmath38 , is of no interest in the following considerations we dispense with quantifying it , but will instead specify just @xmath39 , or , equivalently , @xmath41 which for simplicity we will refer to as salt concentration.    in many experiments , the system is actually not coupled to a salt reservoir and only @xmath38 is known .",
    "one can then imagine it to be coupled to a ( physically not existing ) reservoir with a salt concentration @xmath39 chosen such that it corresponds to the given @xmath38 in the system .",
    "practically , this amounts to inverting the function @xmath42 .",
    "provided we only choose the right @xmath39 corresponding to the known @xmath38 , a real reservoir when coupled to the system would leave the microion density distribution in the system completely unaltered . in other words , every system , be it isolated or not , can be treated as if it _ were _ in contact with a reservoir .",
    "this implies that all our considerations presented here in the semi - grand canonical ensemble are also valid for experiments in the canonical ensemble in which the system is actually not coupled to a salt reservoir .",
    "the pb equation @xcite can be derived from a mean - field free energy functional @xcite which itself is obtained from the underlying hamiltonian either ( i ) as the saddle point of the field theoretic action @xcite , ( ii ) as a density functional reformulation of the partition function combined with a first order cumulant expansion of the correlation term @xcite , or ( iii ) from the gibbs - bogoljubov inequality applied to a trial product state @xcite .",
    "the pb approximation gives a good description in the limit of high temperature and/or small charge densities ( weak - coupling limit ) when the microionic correlations that are neglected at the mean - field level are unimportant .",
    "indeed , these microion correlations play only a negligible role in our system containing only monovalent ions , as has been shown in various studies @xcite .",

    "we should mention a word of caution regarding the lindemann criterion .",

    "since our main interest here lies in the soft potential regime we ignored this and used the universal value 0.19 throughout , just as in @xcite . while for high salt concentrations our melting line is therefore shifted up from the real melting line , we emphasize that for low salt concentrations where we observe many - body effects the position of our melting line should be correct .",
    "if , as claimed above , the difference between our melting line and that of rkg originates in the fact that the effective pair - interaction does not have the functional form of a yukawa potential , then one may expect better agreement when comparing our data to a one - component system with pair - interactions that are more adapted to the effective force curves calculated in sec .",
    "guided by the cut - off behavior observed in our effective - force curves at low salt concentration as well as in the experiment @xcite , we suggest to model effective pair - interactions in colloidal systems by truncated yukawa interactions , @xmath151 where the first line is just the derivative of eq .",

    "while this qualitative conclusions can certainly be drawn , the truncated yukawa model is probably too approximate at low volume - fractions for any quantitative comparison .",
    "we close this section with a few further comments : ( i ) it should be noted that beyond the melting line , in what is referred to as liquid phase in our phase - diagrams , there is , in reality , a region of solid - liquid phase coexistence whose shape and extent remains to be determined .",
    "( ii ) studies treating colloidal suspensions as hard - core yukawa fluids @xcite also revealed a phase - behavior different from that of a pure yukawa fluids .",
    "however , these differences occur only in the limiting case of weakly charged colloids or at extremely high salt concentration which is not considered here . in our treatment , hard - core interactions are included , but play virtually no role .",
    "( iii ) to investigate the effect that a possible size polydispersity of the colloids may have on the melting line , we have performed mc computer studies for particles interacting via @xmath180 where @xmath181 with @xmath182 a gaussian random number with mean value zero and variance @xmath183 .",
    "we found virtually no effect as long as @xmath184 .",
    "only when @xmath183 was as high as 0.1 , a shift of the melting was seen which then however was as strong as the effect observed here .",
    "( iv ) in highly de - ionized systems where colloids are dispersed in organic solvents , the inverse screening length can become as large as a few microns @xcite . in a very recent experiment , yethiraj and van blaaderen @xcite",
    "have studied the crystallization behavior of @xmath185 charge - stabilized colloidal suspensions in an organic solvent where the inverse screening length was 12 @xmath186 . in these systems , many - body effects should then be much more pronounced than in the aqueous system considered here .",
    "the following physical picture emerges from our study , and is described here as a summary of our results .",
    "three - body forces between charged colloids are attractive . by performing effective force calculations ,",
    "all three- and higher - body interactions are folded into an effective pair - potential ; they are integrated out , similar to what is suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . at high salt concentration",
    ", these effective pair interactions are found to be yukawa - like at all distances .",
    "however , if the salt concentration is low ( @xmath187 ) , they are yukawa - like only at short distances , and decay down to zero much faster than a yukawa potential , at larger distances ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "this is due to the folded - in many - body interactions , or , expressed in another way , because the macroions surrounding a given pair of interacting colloids have a screening effect just as the microions do .",
    "the melting behavior of a crystal for colloids interacting via such truncated yukawa pair - interactions is different from that of a pure yukawa system . for a colloidal crystal",
    "whose stability rests on repulsive pair - forces , taking away bonds by truncating the potential has a destabilizing effect on the crystal : it melts more easily ( at lower effective temperature , or higher effective charge ) than it would if the yukawa interactions were not truncated .",
    "we have qualitatively confirmed this picture by effective force calculations , showing explicitly the effect of other macroions on an interacting pair of colloids , and by a full pb - bd simulation of colloidal crystals , yielding a melting line which for the system considered here ( @xmath84 , @xmath132 ) and at low - added salt , shows marked deviations from the classic melting line of a yukawa system determined by rkg @xcite .",
    "our melting line could be well reproduced within a simple one - component model of particles interacting via truncated yukawa potentials .",
    "in essence , in low - salt suspensions at high colloid volume fraction , i.e. , when many - body interactions start playing a role , we predict a liquid phase where one finds a bcc solid in the pair - yukawa description , and a bcc solid where the yukawa system is a fcc solid .",
    "the important influence of many - body interactions on the phase - behavior has long been recognized in rare - gas systems .",
    "but in colloidal systems  which are much better suited to study this question , as the interactions are tunable  this question has not received much attention .",
    "experimental studies of the melting / crystallization behavior of charged colloids , under low salt conditions and possibly also in organic solvents , are highly desirable .",
    "another interesting open question is the effect of many - body interactions on the gas - liquid phase behavior .",
    "for example , the axilrod - teller interaction potential has been shown to have a measurable impact on the gas - liquid equilibrium of argon @xcite .",
    "the question of a possible gas - liquid phase coexistence in colloidal systems is currently studied mainly with volume term theories @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see the effect of three - body interactions on the gas - liquid phase - coexistence in colloidal systems .",
    "a rough estimate of this effect , within a simple van - der waals picture , is given in @xcite , showing that , in principle , attractive three - body interactions provide enough cohesive energy for a gas - liquid phase coexistence to become possible .",
    "more definite answers to these questions , can be expected either from studies using approaches similar to our poisson - boltzmann - brownian dynamics method or more rigorous primitive model studies , similar to those presented by linse and lobaskin @xcite .",
    "we believe that the present article adresses the chemical physics community and that the results presented are new , relevant and suitable for publication in your journal . e.s .",
