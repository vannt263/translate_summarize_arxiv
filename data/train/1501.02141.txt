    "searches are performed for pair or single production of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "many cms and atlas analyses use boosted tagging techniques to identify higgs , top quark , @xmath3 or @xmath29 bosons from heavy quarks .",
    "the search strategy consists in discriminating signal from background using @xmath30 , the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the reconstructed jets , leptons , and missing transverse energy , or @xmath31 , the reconstructed invariant mass of the final - state objects in each channel .",
    "no new results were presented at this conference . in absence of an observed signal",

    "atlas and cms results can be found in references @xcite .",
    "in addition searches for quarks with a charge of 5/3 e and 2/3 e have not seen any significant deviation from the sm and limits exclude top quark partners with masses below 800 gev for all possible values of the branching fractions @xcite .",
    "the top quark plays an important role in beyond - standard model ( bsm ) theories . atlas and cms have used 8 tev proton - proton collisions from the lhc and the full dataset of about 20 fb@xmath0 to search for different bsm signatures .",
