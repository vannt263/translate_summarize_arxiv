    "cosmology has made a long way on the last years with the impressive amount of observations and theoretical advancements . yet",
    ", cosmology faces many challenging questions like the fundamental cause of the recent acceleration of the universe as predicted by sneia observations almost twenty years ago @xcite , and afterwards confirmed by several type of cosmological and astrophysical observations ( see for example @xcite for a recent account on this issue ) .",
    "the simplest approach is to assume a cosmological constant that started recently dominating the late - time energy density budget of the universe which is in agreement with the current observations @xcite .",
    "but then the issues _ of why is it so tiny ?",
    "_ and _ why this cosmological constant has begun to be important only right now ? _ have to be addressed as well ( see for example : @xcite ) .",
    "another , equally important , issue is what happens if the cosmological constant is not quite constant ? this has lead to a great interest in exploring other possible scenarios to explain the late - time acceleration of the cosmos by invoking either an additional matter component in the universe , which we name dark energy ( de ) @xcite , or by modifying appropriately the laws of gravity ( for a recent account on this issue see , for example , @xcite and the extensive list of references provided therein ) .",
    "we will focus on the third question : _ what happens if the cosmological constant is not quite constant ? _ more precisely , we will address this question on the framework of the cosmological perturbations and for some de models whose equations of state ; i.e. , the ratio between its pressure and its energy density , deviate slightly from the one corresponding to a cosmological constant . before proceeding let us remind the following well known fact : if the equation of state ( eos ) of de deviates from -1 , the universe fate might be quite different from the one corresponding to an empty de sitter universe . in particular ,",
    "if the equation of state of dark energy is smaller than -1 , i.e. , de is apparently ( and at least from an effective point of view ) not fulfilling the null energy condition , several future singularities or abrupt events might correspond to the cosmic doomsday of the universe . amazingly , some of these models are in accordance with current data @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the theory of cosmological perturbations is a cornerstone of nowadays cosmology .",
    "it provides us with a theoretical framework which allows us to determine , for example , the cmb predicted from an early inflationary era or compute the matter power spectrum and the growth rate of matter in order to make a comparison with the observational results .",
    "in addition , it allows us to compute the evolution and possible clustering of de perturbations and investigate their effect on the growth of dark matter ( dm ) . even though no perturbations of de have so far been detected , and are in fact absent in the @xmath0cdm model , the existence of a great number of experiments aiming to probe the physics of the late - universe , like the dark energy survey @xcite and the euclid mission @xcite , suggests that a thorough study and characterization of such effects can be proven to be important to understand the nature of this mysterious fluid that drives the acceleration of the universe . with this mindset , on this work",
    "we analyse the perturbative effects of phantom de models and look for observational fingerprints that could be used as a mean to favour or disregard such models .",
    "there are three genuinely phantom de fates ; i.e. , which happens if and only if a phantom de component is present :    * big rip ( br ) singularity : it happens at a finite cosmic time with an infinite scale factor where the hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivative diverge @xcite .",
    "* little rip ( lr ) : this case corresponds to an abrupt event , i.e. , it is not strictly speaking a future space - time singularity , as it takes place at an infinite cosmic time @xcite .",
    "the radius of the universe , the hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivative all diverge at an infinite cosmic time @xcite . *",
    "little sibling of the big rip ( lsbr ) : this behaviour again corresponds to an abrupt event rather than a future space - time singularity . at this event ,",
    "the hubble rate and the scale factor blow up but the cosmic derivative of the hubble rate does not @xcite .",
    "consequetly , this abrupt event takes place at an infinite cosmic time where the scalar curvature diverges .",
    "these three cases share in common the fact that in the ( far ) future all the structures in the universe would be ripped apart in a finite cosmic time @xcite .",
    "the classical singular asymptotic behaviour of these dark energy models has lead to a quantum cosmological analysis of these setups @xcite . in these works",
    ", it was concluded that once the universe enters in a genuinely quantum phase ; i.e. , where coherence and entanglement effects are important , the universe would evade a doomsday _  la rip _ and this applies even to the smoother version of these singular behaviours corresponding to a lsbr @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will analyse the cosmological perturbations of de models that induces a br , lr or lsbr .",
    "while the background analysis of the phantom de scenario has been widely analysed this has not been the case of its cosmological perturbations @xcite . in @xcite a kinematical approach was assumed , i.e. , a dependence of the scale factor as a function of the cosmic time was considered for flrw universes with future singularities at a finite cosmic time . within this setup and using approximated equations for the growth of the perturbations at late - time",
    ", the authors obtained the dm and de perturbations @xcite . furthermore , in @xcite , de perturbations are disregarded and only the growth rate of matter perturbations is calculated . in this work , we will rather assume a dynamical model , i.e. , we assume a given eos for de .",
    "this is the approach employed in ref @xcite , where the future behaviour of the linear scalar perturbations is presented for a type of model that , depending on the value of the parameters , can lead to a br or a big freeze singularity @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we use the full theory of linear perturbation to study how the perturbations of dm and de , as well as the gravitational potential , evolve for a range of different scales .",
    "our numerical integrations start from well inside the radiation era and continue till the far future .",
    "in fact , in order to see the behaviour of the phantom de models , we extend our numerical calculations till the universe is roughly @xmath2 times larger than at present , i.e. , roughly @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect",
    ".  [ review ] , we briefly review de models that induce a br , lr or lsbr ; i.e. , we review perfect fluid that can describe de from a phenomenological point of view and leading to the above mentioned singularity or abrupt events . in sect .",
    "[ perturbed equations ] , we present the framework for studying the scalar linear perturbations . the evolution equations obtained employ no approximations and are therefore valid for all relevant modes and redshifts , as long as the linear theory is itself valid . a phenomenological mapping of the de fluid to a phantom scalar field is employed to avoid classical instabilities in the perturbations of de .",

    "in fact , as discussed in @xcite , when a particle - physics description of the phantom dark energy is attempted , some instabilities may rise in the theory due to higher order effects . in the particular case of the phantom scalar field it was found that an infinite decay rate of dark energy particles into gravitons would occur unless an appropriate cut - off is introduced at some energy scale below the planck scale , rendering the phantom scalar field as an effective description up to that enegy scale . in all three models presented in this work ,",

    "<S> we carry out an analysis of the cosmological perturbations in general relativity for three different models which are good candidates to describe the current acceleration of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> these three set - ups are described classically by perfect fluids with a phantom nature and represent deviations from the most widely accepted @xmath0cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , each of the models under study induce different future singularities or abrupt events known as ( i ) big rip , ( ii ) little rip and ( iii ) little sibling of the big rip . </S>",
    "<S> only the first one is regarded as a true singularity since it occurs at a finite cosmic time . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we refer to the others as abrupt events . with the aim to find possible footprints of this scenario in the universe matter distribution , </S>",
    "<S> we not only obtain the evolution of the cosmological scalar perturbations but also calculate the matter power spectrum for each model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we constrain observationally these models using several measurements of the growth rate function , more precisely @xmath1 , and compare our results with the observational ones reaching the conclusion that even if these three models are very similar at present there are small differences that could allow us to distinguish them . </S>"
