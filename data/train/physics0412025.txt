    "the `` alpha model , '' as it has come to be called in fluid mechanics , is a procedure whereby , by suppressing small spatial scales in a computation in a way that intends to do minimum damage to the accuracy with which the long wavelength spectral components are calculated , one can realize substantial savings in computing time @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we gave a simple way to extend the alpha model to magnetohydrodynamics ( see also @xcite for extensions in the non - dissipative case ) , we specialized it to two dimensions , and numerically tested its predictions in a series of computations .",

    "we take the 3d alpha model mhd equations @xcite and describe briefly four problems upon which they will be tested against dns treatments of the same problems .",
    "they are selective decay , dynamic alignment , the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity , and the mechanically driven turbulent dynamo .",
    "the first two have already been tested in 2d @xcite and the third has a 2d analogue in the inverse cascade of magnetic vector potential @xcite .",

    "other features of the dns runs , such as the probability distribution functions of the fluctuating quantities ( such as local energy dissipation rates ) , have also been reproduced by the @xmath0-model as they were in two dimensions @xcite , but we have not shown those results here because they are so similar to what was found in two dimensions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite also the errors of the @xmath0-model computations were compared against under - resolved dns .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath0-model in three dimensions is comparable to our previous results , and therefore we refer the reader to our previous work for a detailed discussion about this topic .    in conclusion , the mhd @xmath0-model can be considered to be validated , at least for the behavior of long - wavelength spectra in periodic boundary conditions .",
