    "the discovery of cosmic acceleration @xcite has stimulated a construction of a class of dark energy models @xcite describing this effect .",
    "this dark energy should possess a negative pressure such that the relation between pressure and energy density @xmath0 is less than @xmath1 .",
    "some observations indicate that the present day value of the parameter @xmath2 provides the best fit .",
    "the corresponding dark energy has been named phantom dark energy @xcite . according to some authors , the analysis of observations , permits to specify the existence of the moment when the universe changes the value of the parameter @xmath0 from that the region @xmath3 to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this transition is called `` the crossing of the phantom divide line '' .",
    "it is easy to see , that the standard minimally coupled scalar field can not give rise to the phantom dark energy , because in this model the absolute value of energy density is always greater than that of pressure , i.e. @xmath4 . a possible way out of this situation is the consideration of the scalar field models with the negative kinetic term .",
    "thus , the important problem arising in connection with the phantom energy is the crossing of the phantom divide line .",
    "the general belief is that while this crossing is not admissible in simple minimally coupled models its explanation requires more complicated models such as multifield ones or models with non - minimal coupling between scalar field and gravity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in our preceding paper @xcite",
    "we have described the phenomenon of the change of sign of the kinetic term of the scalar field implied by einstein equations .",
    "now we try to answer the question how general is this phenomenon . in other words , is it some curiosity arising due to a very particular choice of the form of a potential of a scalar field and of initial conditions or it is rather a typical phenomenon . in doing this , we introduce a notion of the network of cosmological histories and qualitatively describe its properties .",
    "admittedly , our research looks purely academical , but we stress that the persisting signals in favor of the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath2 @xcite justifies the interest in this topic and , in particular , in our systematic approach .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : sec .",
    "ii is devoted to a brief recapitulation of the technique of reconstruction of scalar ( phantom ) potentials and the transformation of the unique scalar - phantom field ( i.e. the crossing of the phantom divide line ; in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the role of initial conditions for the phantom divide line crossing phenomenon ; sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the analysis of a simple mechanical system with the potential with a cusp , which is strictly motivated by the requirement of the possibility of crossing of the phantom divide line within a framework which allows a unique scalar field ; in sec .",
    "v we introduce the notion of network of cosmological histories ; the section vi contains concluding remarks in the appendix a we shall present simple solvable examples of such networks . in the appendix b we shall describe some potentials as functions of time or scalar field , for which exact solution of the einstein equations is possible .",
    "let us remember the main points of our approach .",
    "we have considered the minimally coupled scalar field with an exponential potential @xmath5 such potentials are widely studied in cosmology @xcite and have a particular solution corresponding to a special choice of initial conditions , which implies the power - law behavior of the cosmological radius @xmath6 or , in other terms , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hubble variable . changing the initial conditions ( i.e. the value of @xmath9 corresponding to some value of @xmath10 ) one shall have other laws of cosmological evolution , which can not be presented explicitly , but which have the same qualitative behavior as ( [ radius ] ) .",
    "however , one can consider the potential ( [ exponent ] not as a function of the scalar field @xmath10 , but as a function of the cosmic time parameter @xmath11 as was done in @xcite . in this case",
    "the einstein ( friedmann ) equation is equivalent to the linear second - order differential equation @xmath12 for the volume function @xmath13 the potential @xmath14 corresponding to the exponential potential ( [ exponent ] ) and to the choice of the initial conditions providing the evolution ( [ radius ] ) is @xmath15 equation ( [ equation ] ) with the potential ( [ pot - time ] ) has a _ general _ solution @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nonnegative constants .",
    "if @xmath19 , one reproduces the cosmological evolution ( [ radius ] ) , while if @xmath20 the cosmological evolution requires the presence of the phantom scalar field with the negative sign of the kinetic term .",
    "the most interesting situation reveals when , both the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nonzero .",
    "simple calculation shows that in this case the hubble variable has a maximum point where , the kinetic term is forced to change its sign .. in which this can be described in a consistent way ]    now , fixing the relation between these coefficients one can ask what is the corresponding form of the potential as a function of the scalar field @xmath10 .",
    "the explicit form of this function can not be found , but we have studied @xcite its asymptotic behavior at singularities and in the point @xmath21 , where the kinetic term changes the sign and ( de)-phantomization occurs , or , in other words , where the universe crosses the phantom divide line . in the neighborhood of the moment @xmath21 , which depend on the relation between the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite , the potential has the form @xmath22 the scalar field behaves correspondingly as @xmath23",
    "in the previous section we have implicitly chosen such initial conditions so that simultaneously the scalar field and its time derivatives vanish at the point @xmath21 , which in turn implies the crossing of the phantom divide line .",
    "however , let us fix the form of the potential as a function of the scalar field @xmath10 and see how the behavior of the universe will change depending on the initial conditions .",
    "suppose that when the cosmic parameter is close to @xmath21 the potential behaves as @xmath24 the scalar field can have the following form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 to provide the vanishing of the time derivative of the scalar field at the point @xmath21 .",
    "the situation described above and corresponding to the ( de ) - phantomization of the scalar field @xcite realizes when @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "let us consider the cases when @xmath29 , analyzing the klein - gordon equation @xmath30 the terms here behave as @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34    let us consider the case @xmath35 . in this case the first and the second terms of eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) vanish at @xmath36 while the term ( [ pot - der ] ) is a constant .",
    "thus , we have come to a contradiction and this case should be disregarded .",
    "now , considering the case @xmath37 , we see that while the term containing the first derivative of the scalar field vanishes the term with the second derivative becomes a constant ( @xmath38 ) to be equated to the the term ( [ pot - der ] ) up to the sign .",
    "therefore , we obtain the relation @xmath39 it is easy to see that in this case the time derivative of the hubble parameter @xmath40 behaves as @xmath41 in contrast to the behavior @xmath42 , corresponding to the case @xmath27 , considered in @xcite .",
    "apparently , the behavior ( [ hubble - der ] ) means that the hubble variable has at the moment @xmath21 an inflection point instead of the extremum point and hence , the kinetic term for the scalar field conserves its sign .    in the case when @xmath43 the second derivative term diverges while other terms are finite , so this behavior can not be realized .",
    "until now we have considered the cosmological trajectories having at some moment the vanishing time derivative @xmath9 of the scalar field , while @xmath10 could have zero or nonzero values .",
    "however , there is also another class of trajectories characterized by the fact that at some moment @xmath44 the scalar field vanishes , while its first time derivative is different from zero .",
    "such trajectories are characterized by the equation : @xmath45 where the constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 satisfy the condition @xmath48 which can be easily obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ kg ] ) and ( [ pot - der ] ) . calculating the second time derivative of the hubble variable",
    ", one can see that it behaves as @xmath49 that means that higher curvature invariants including the curvature derivatives diverge and one encounters the so called soft singularity .",
    "the problem of removal of such singularities is of interest by intself , but will not be considered here .",
    "thus , let us summarize the results of the above consideration .",
    "we have found three types of the trajectories .",
    "for the first family of the trajectories the time derivative of the scalar field vanishes at the moment @xmath21 .",
    "this family is a one - parameter one and is parametrized by the value of the scalar field @xmath50 , which should be different from zero at the moment @xmath21 .",
    "all the nonzero values of @xmath50 require @xmath37 , the value of @xmath51 is fixed by relation ( [ relation ] ) , the hubble variable has an inflection point and the kinetic term conserves its sign .",
    "the second family contains the only trajectory with @xmath27 .",
    "now the term ( [ pot - der ] ) becomes singular and behaves as @xmath52 , the term with the first derivative vanishes , while the second derivative term behaves like @xmath53 .",
    "consistency requires @xmath28 and the value of @xmath51 is uniquely fixed .",
    "the hubble variable has at the moment @xmath21 an extremum and crossing of the phantom divide line occurs .",
    "the third family is characterized by eqs .",
    "( [ singul ] ) , ( [ condsing ] ) and suffers from a soft cosmological singularity .",
    "it seems that in some sense one can consider the possibility of the crossing of the phantom divide line as was described in @xcite as exceptional and the corresponding initial conditions as having measure zero .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to show that considering broader set of potentials and initial conditions , one can come to the conclusion , that conditions providing the crossing are , roughly speaking , commensurable to those excluding it .",
    "we postpone the corresponding consideration until the fifth section , while the next section will be devoted to an analysis of the simple mechanical model of the particle moving in the potential with a cusp .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional problem of a classical point particle moving in the potential @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath56 we consider three classes of possible motions characterized by the value of the energy @xmath57 .",
    "the first class consists of the motions when @xmath58 .",
    "apparently , the particle with @xmath59 or with @xmath60 can not reach the point @xmath61 and stops at the points @xmath62 respectively .",
    "this class of motions corresponds to the class of cosmological evolutions described in the preceding chapter when the hubble variable has an inflection point and the universe does not cross the phantom divide line .",
    "the second class includes the trajectories when @xmath63 . in this case",
    "the particle crosses the point @xmath61 with nonvanishing velocity and this case correspond to the cosmological evolution given by eq .",
    "( [ singul ] ) , but naturally there is nothing singular in it , because in our simple mechanical problem , we do not have nothing similar to the hubble variable and the spacetime geometry defined by its behavior .",
    "if we have a fine tuning such that @xmath64 , we encounter an exceptional case .",
    "now the trajectory satisfying eq .",
    "( [ classical1])in the vicinity of the point @xmath61 can behave as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "it is easy to see that independently of the sign of @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ c - define ] ) the signs of the particle coordinate @xmath69 and of its velocity @xmath70 are opposite and hence , the particle can arrive in finite time to the point of the cusp of the potential @xmath61 .",
    "another solution reads as @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "this solution describes the particle going away from the point @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we can combine the branches of the solutions ( [ classical2 ] ) and ( [ classical4 ] ) in four different manners and there is no way to choose if the particle arriving to the point @xmath73 should go back or should pass the cusp of the potential ( [ classical ] ) .",
    "it can stop at the top as well .",
    "such a `` degenerate '' behavior of the particle in this third case is connected with the fact that this trajectory is the separatrix between two one - parameter families described above . at the moment",
    "there is not yet any strict analogy between this separatrix and the cosmological evolution describing the phantom divide line . in order to establish a closer analogy and to understand what is the crucial difference between mechanical consideration and general relativistic one",
    ", we can try to introduce a friction term into the newton equation ( [ classical1 ] ) @xmath74 it is easy to check that if the friction coefficient @xmath75 is a constant one does not have a qualitative change in respect to the discussion above .",
    "let us asuume for @xmath75 the dependence @xmath76 then @xmath77 and @xmath78 the trajectory arriving to the cusp with vanishing velocity is still described by the solution ( [ classical2 ] ) . consider the particle coming to the cusp from the left ( @xmath79 .",
    "it is easy to see that the value of @xmath80 at the moment @xmath21 tends to zero , while its second derivative @xmath81 given by eq .",
    "( [ gammaddot ] ) is @xmath82 thus , it looks like the friction coefficient @xmath75 reaches its minimum value at @xmath83 .",
    "let us suppose now that the particle is coming back to the left from the cusp and its motion is described by eq .",
    "( [ classical4 ] ) with negative @xmath68 .",
    "a simple check shows that in this case @xmath84 thus , from the point of view of the subsequent evolution this point looks as a maximum for the function @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , it means simply that the second derivative of the friction coefficient has a jump at the point @xmath83 .",
    "it is easy to check that if instead of choosing the motion to the left , we shall move forward our particle to the right from the cusp ( @xmath86 ) , the sign of @xmath87 remains negative as in eq .",
    "( [ gammaddot2 ] ) and hence we have the jump of this second derivative again . if one would like to avoid this jump , one should try to change the sign in eq .",
    "( [ gammaddot ] ) . to implement it in a self - consistent way one can substitute eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) by @xmath88 and eq .",
    "( [ classical5 ] ) by @xmath89 in fact , it is exactly that what happens automatically in cosmology , when we change the sign of the kinetic energy term for the scalar field , crossing the phantom divide line .",
    "naturally , in cosmology the role of @xmath75 is played by the hubble variable @xmath40 .",
    "the jump of the second derivative of the friction coefficient @xmath75 corresponds to the divergence of the third time derivative of the hubble variable , which represents some kind of soft cosmological singularity ( this singularity is even softer than that considered in the preceding section for the family of cosmologies characterized by eq .",
    "( [ singul ] ) where already the second time derivative of the hubble variable was divergent ) .",
    "thus , one seems to confront the problem of choosing between two alternatives : 1 ) to encounter a weak singularity in the spacetime geometry ; 2 ) to change the sign of the kinetic term for matter field . in this paper",
    "we pursue the second alternative insofar as we privilege the smoothness of spacetime geometry and consider equations of motion for matter as less fundamental than the einstein equations ( see also more detailed discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , all the previous considerations were based on the treatment of the potential as a fixed function of the scalar field and changing initial conditions for this scalar field . as was already emphasized @xcite one can use an alternative treatment of the potential @xmath90 as a function of time . in the example considered in @xcite , it was shown that for @xmath14 instead the initial conditions which exclude the crossing of the phantom divide line are exceptional .",
    "let us try to imagine a set of possible cosmologies as a two - dimensional surface ( see the picture below ) where the vertical lines represent the potentials as functions of @xmath10 while the horizontal lines represent the potentials as functions of @xmath11 .",

    "corresponds to changing of initial conditions keeping fixed the form of the potential .",
    "for example , for the vertical line corresponding to the exponential potential ( [ exponent ] ) ( see the line @xmath91 in the picture , the black circle @xmath95 corresponds to the power - law cosmological evolution given by formulae ( [ radius ] ) and ( [ hubble ] ) ) there are no initial conditions allowing the crossing of the phantom divide line .",
    "now , fixing the initial conditions providing the cosmological evolution ( [ radius ] ) , ( [ hubble ] ) we obtain the potential @xmath96 and moving along the corresponding horizontal line one finds that at all the points , excluding the point of intersection @xmath95 , there is the ( de)-phantomization effect . let us stop now at some point of the horizontal line ( say , @xmath97 ) and fix the corresponding form of the potential @xmath94 as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "then , one can begin moving along the vertical line , corresponding to this form of @xmath94 .",
    "the intersection point @xmath97 corresponds to such choice of initial conditions when @xmath10 and @xmath98 vanish simultaneously at some moment @xmath21 . and",
    "this is the only point of the vertical line , where the crossing of the phantom divide line occurs as was shown above . to come to this conclusion",
    "we have used only some general properties of the form of the potential around a candidate moment of the crossing of the phantom divide line .",
    "now , we undertake a similar analysis showing that for a horizontal line ( potential as a function of @xmath11 ) almost all the initial conditions imply the crossing effect .",
    "let us consider a potential @xmath93 corresponding to the horizontal line intersecting the vertical line @xmath94 at the point @xmath68 .",
    "we shall look for a cosmological evolution where the hubble variable has an extremum at the moment @xmath21 .",
    "a regular potential can be represented around this moment as @xmath99 then eq . ( [ equation ] ) acquires the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "we shall look for two independent solutions in the vicinity of @xmath102 ; in the form @xmath103 the recurrent relation between the coefficients @xmath104 is @xmath105 we define the first independent solution by fixing of the first two coefficients as @xmath106 while for the second solution we choose @xmath107 ( one can easily check that these solutions are independent , calculating the first terms of their wronskian ) .",
    "the leading terms of the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ equation1 ] ) has the following form : @xmath108 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nonnegative .",
    "we shall need also the expressions for the first and second time derivatives of the solution ( [ solution1 ] ) : @xmath109 @xmath110    the time derivative of the hubble variable has the form @xmath111 it is enough to study the numerator of expression ( [ hubble - structure ] ) @xmath112    to have at the moment @xmath113 the extremum of the function @xmath114 its time derivative should behave as @xmath115 , that means that eq .",
    "( [ hubble - structure1 ] ) implies that @xmath116 and @xmath117    the condition ( [ cond - extr ] ) determines the relation between the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 in terms of the coefficient @xmath118 .",
    "thus , for a potential @xmath14 fixing the moment of time @xmath21 we fix the constants @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "if the condition ( [ cond - extr1 ] ) is satisfied , choosing the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 satisfying condition ( [ cond - extr ] ) one obtains a cosmological evolution undergoing the crossing of the phantom divide line .",
    "thus , we have seen that considering the potential as a function of the scalar field having a cusp we should choose exceptional initial conditions to describe a smooth cosmological evolution undergoing the phantom divide line crossing .",
    "we have seen also that there is some kind of complementarity between the smoothness of the spacetime geometry and that of the structure of matter action .    on the hand ,",
    "considering the potential as a function of time we encounter just the following situation : initial conditions implying the crossing of the phantom divide line are typical .",
    "that means that roughly speaking in the set of all possible cosmological trajectories those crossing and non - crossing the phantom divide line have measures of the same order .",
    "we are not able to construct a rigorous description of this set of cosmological histories , but the treatment undertaken above permits to make some qualitative remarks .",
    "first of all let us notice that a network of vertical lines representing the potential as a function of the scalar field and horizontal lines , representing potentials as functions of the cosmic time , is not closed .",
    "namely , let us leave a vertical line at the point @xmath95 and make some walk along the horizontal line to the point @xmath97 .",
    "at the point @xmath97 we shall have a cosmology with the crossing .",
    "then let us make some walk along the vertical line from the point @xmath97 to some point @xmath68 .",
    "the cosmology corresponding to the point @xmath68 is free from crossing .",
    "now , traveling along the horizontal line from point @xmath68 we shall always have trajectories with crossing and , hence , we shall not have an opportunity to return to the initial vertical line , which should have cosmologies without crossing .",
    "( the empty circle @xmath120 in our picture signifies the absence of intersection between the respective vertical and horizontal lines ) .",
    "there is another interesting question .",
    "it is well known that for the exponential potential ( [ exponent ] ) all the initial conditions imply the cosmologies free from the crossing phenomenon .",
    "the explanation of this fact is a very simple one : the effect of smooth crossing @xcite can have place only for potentials which at some point have a divergent derivative with respect to the scalar field , while the derivative of the exponential potential is always regular .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to say that the above investigation shows that the smooth crossing of the phantom divide line in simple cosmological models could be considered as a rather natural phenomenon more than an exotic anomaly .",
    "the network of cosmological histories constructed for the illustration of this fact seems to be interesting object on its own .",
    "the points of this network represent functions @xmath121 on which two transformations generated by means of scalar field potentials , treated as functions of @xmath10 or of @xmath11 .",
    "graphically they were represented as displacements along vertical and horizontal lines .",
    "the network discussed in this paper was constructed beginning from the simple cosmological evolution ( [ hubble ] ) .",
    "notice that our initial point of network ( [ hubble ] ) is characterized by some value of the equation of state parameter @xmath0 and is nothing but a power - law evolution ( [ radius ] ) .",
    "the points lying on a horizontal line intersecting this initial power - law point ( the point a on our picture ) , are described explicitly @xcite and have more complicated structure . as far",
    "as other points of the network are concerned we have studied above some of their local properties , but we are not able to describe their global topology .",
    "it seems unlikely that two different power - law points belong to the same network .",
    "if this statement is confirmed one has got a family of networks characterized by different values of the initial constant equation of state parameter @xmath0 . in the appendix",
    "a we give an explicit illustration of the simplest network containing an exponential expansion , while in the appendix b we give some other examples of potentials for which it is possible to find exact solutions .",

    "we present here a particularly simple and in some way degenerate example of the network of cosmic histories which is discrete and contains only three points .",
    "let us consider de sitter universe with @xmath122 the corresponding potential as is well - known and as can be easily obtained from the equation ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) @xmath123 has the form @xmath124 while the initial condition is @xmath125 this initial condition can be defined at any moment of time and the evolution shall conserve it , because the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) for the constant potential ( [ pot - ds ] ) has the form @xmath126 notice that in this case the klein - gordon equation has the same form for usual scalar and phantom .",
    "now , treating the potential as a constant function of time we can easily resolve for this case eq .",
    "( [ equation ] ) : @xmath127 the hubble function correspondingly is @xmath128 while its time derivative is @xmath129 as usual the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nonnegative .",
    "correspondingly we have three opportunities . if @xmath19 this is our initial point describing infinitely expanding flat de sitter universe .",
    "if @xmath20 , one has an infinitely contracting flat de sitter universe .",
    "if both the coefficients are positive , the hubble variable is growing and this situation could be realized only in the universe where the scalar field has a negative kinetic term ( phantom ) .",
    "it is easy to understand that a change of the relation @xmath130 is simply equivalent to the shift of the cosmic time variable @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we have only one cosmic history described by phantom field with the constant potential . in this history",
    "the universe begins its evolution at @xmath131 with a quasi - de sitter contraction .",
    "it arrives to a minimum possible value of the cosmological radius at some moment @xmath132 .",
    "this moment can be easily found from eq .",
    "( [ hubble - degen ] ) however , its value does not have a particular meaning just like the relation @xmath130 .",
    "after the moment @xmath132 begins an expansion which at @xmath133 becomes quasi - de sitter . making a convenient shift of the time variable we can write down eq .",
    "( [ hubble - degen ] ) in a specially simple form : @xmath134 thus , instead of a horizontal line we obtain two discrete points .",
    "now , let us treat the constant potential ( [ pot - ds ] ) as a function of @xmath10 changing the initial condition for the time derivative of this field .",
    "it is easy to show that for @xmath135 there two cosmological histories given by the following expression for the hubble variable : @xmath136 these solutions describe a universe which begins its evolution from cosmological singularity at @xmath137 and then is infinitely expanding arriving to quasi - de sitter phase at @xmath133 and a universe which begins its evolution at @xmath138 and then contracts arriving to the big crunch type cosmological singularity at @xmath137 .",
    "it is important to notice that the choice of the initial value of the time derivative of the scalar field is not important , because in the process of evolution this value runs between @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the sign of this time derivative is not important either because the potential of this field is constant .",
    "thus , we have presented a schematic example of an exactly solvable cosmological network , which contains only five discrete points .",
    "two of these points represent an infinitely expanding and infinitely contracting de sitter universes , two of them describe universe evolving from the cosmological singularity to an infinite expansion or vice versa , driven by a scalar field with constant potential .",
    "the last point represents a universe which passes from contraction to expansion and is driven by a phantom field .",
    "all the network is characterized by an absolute value of the constant @xmath141 . indeed ,",
    "beginning from @xmath142 we arrive to the same network , which was constructed from @xmath141 .    as a last remark we can give two examples of even more trivial networks of cosmological histories .",
    "first of them contains only one point .",
    "if one has a negative constant potential @xmath143 , than the only cosmological history present in the network is that given by @xmath144 describing the evolution from the big bang at @xmath145 to the big crunch at @xmath146 passing through the point of maximal expansion at @xmath137 .",
    "the second network consists of three points .",
    "considering massless scalar field with vanishing potential , one can see that there are three opportunities : if the time derivative of the scalar field is nonzero , then one has either a universe which begins its evolution from the big bang singularity and expands infinitely or a universe which contracts finishing in the big crunch singularity .",
    "if the time derivative of the scalar field is zero , one has a static minkowski universe .",
    "the concept of the network of cosmological histories introduced in this paper is based on the simultaneous use of the notion of potential as function of time and as function of the scalar field .",
    "unfortunately , it is much more difficult to find exactly solvable examples for potentials as functions of scalar fields than for those , treated as functions of time .",
    "thus , we , first give another example of the potential as function of @xmath10 ( see , for additional details @xcite ) .",

    "we shall consider the case @xmath152 .",
    "now , the solution is @xmath153 if @xmath19 , we come back to our starting point : a cosmological evolution ( [ hubblecom ] ) , ( [ radiuscom ] ) for @xmath152 .",
    "let us rewrite the solution ( [ solution - com1 ] for this case in the form @xmath155 let us consider first the case @xmath156 .",
    "then , the volume function @xmath157 will be nonnegative in the intervals : @xmath158 and @xmath159 the hubble variable can be expressed as @xmath160 and its time derivative reads @xmath161 where @xmath162 one can see by simple algebraic treatment that the function @xmath163 can have the only zero at some moment @xmath21 in the interval ( [ interval ] ) , i.e. when @xmath164 .",

    "the inclusion of the term with @xmath168 can change some features of the cosmological evolution .",
    "however , the qualitative and numerical analysis of the corresponding differential equations shows that the number of the moments of time when the universe crosses the phantom divide line does not change .      here , the universe begins its evolution at @xmath137 in the phase of phantom - type contraction , which at some moment ( when @xmath121 crosses the line @xmath170 ) is substituted by the phase of phantom - type expansion .",
    "after some period , the universe crosses the phantom divide line ( when @xmath121 has its maximum value ) and enters into the phase of an infinite normal expansion .    as we have already mentioned above",

    ", one can find some potentials treated as functions of the cosmic time parameter , for which one can find complete exact solutions .",
    "it is connected with the linearity of the corresponding equation ( [ equation ] ) , which is nothing but a schrdinger equation for a system with zero energy .",
    "thus , we can borrow some solvable examples of such potentials from non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we shall give here a couple of examples of such potentials .",
