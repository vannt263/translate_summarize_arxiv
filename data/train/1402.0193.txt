    "theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the heat , unlike the work , does not obey the fluctuation theorem even in the infinite @xmath86 limit  @xcite .",
    "it is rather surprising because the work and the heat are proportional to @xmath2 on average while their difference @xmath87 does not scale with @xmath2 .",
