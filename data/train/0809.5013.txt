    "the behaviours of the yb ions at the two sites are thus rather different : above 3.5  k , there is a vanishing molecular field at the @xmath4 site , which means that the exchange field from the mn ions is zero .",

    "an estimation would require an evaluation of the relevant spin - orbit coupling constant .",

    "we have studied the magnetic order in ybmno@xmath0 and found a consistent description by combining mssbauer and neutrons probes .",
    "the temperature dependences of the yb and mn magnetic moments are well fitted in a molecular field approach , showing that yb(4b ) moments order due to the mn molecular field , whereas the yb(2a ) moments order at much lower temperature through yb - yb interactions .",
    "we could determine the mn magnetic structure and distinguish between two homometric configurations by considerations about the magnetic environment of each r(4b ) sites . in ybmno@xmath0 , we found a @xmath51 configuration for mn moments associated with f stacking of af yb(4b ) layers .",
