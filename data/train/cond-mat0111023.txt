    "superconductivity in all high @xmath14 cuprates is induced by carrier doping . except the most recent results on field - doping experiments@xcite ,",
    "the vast majority of data available in the literature are based on chemical doping .",
    "unfortunately carrier doping by chemical substitution or intercalation is always accompanied by the introduction of dopants into the material and the higher carrier concentration requires more dopants that inevitably affect the electronic state of the system . even without any external perturbations ,",
    "intrinsic dopant effects can not be ignored .",
    "furthermore , since carriers can be introduced either by cation and/or by anion doping , complications such as different lattice responses to accommodate different kinds of dopants have to be taken into account .",
    "cationic doping proceeds via substitution of cations with ions of different valency .",
    "we will use the notation ",
    "hard doping  since the cationic dopants occupy lattice sites and are immobile .",
    "anionic doping , however , frequently results in a system of mobile dopants ( e.g. interstitial or chain oxygen ) that provides an additional degree of freedom and may respond to a change of thermodynamic parameters such as temperature or pressure .",
    "we will denote the doping with mobile anions as  soft doping  .",
    "@xmath15 is one of the high @xmath14-compounds that allow us to continuously tune the relative strength of  hard - dopant  versus  soft - dopant  of randomly distributed but immobile sr ions ( concentration @xmath16 ) and mobile interstitial oxygen ions ( concentration @xmath17 ) , respectively .",
    "accordingly , we can study their influences on the normal and superconducting states as a function of hole concentration , @xmath18 , controlled by two parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we use the notations  soft - dopant  and  hard - dopant  here instead of",
    " annealed -disorder  and  quenched- disorder  to emphasize both the intrinsic nature ( e.g. dopant increases with increasing carrier density ) and the strong coupling between carriers and dopants .",
    "the crucial parameter is the excess - oxygen doping .",
    "the high mobility of the interstitial oxygen provides not only the opportunity to study the  intrinsic  electronic evolution as a function of carrier concentration but also a number of interesting new physical phenomena .",
    "for example , several structural transitions as well as macroscopic phase separations have been observed in @xmath19 with increasing oxygen content.@xcite for @xmath20 a miscibility gap was observed with two different structures ( bmab and fmmm symmetry ) coexisting at low temperatures .",
    "chemically , the two structures show different oxygen contents . the bmab structure is not superconducting and its composition is close to stoichiometric @xmath21 whereas the oxygen rich fmmm phase becomes superconducting at about 30 k.@xcite the origin of this phase separation was attributed to the mobile interstitial oxygen since it is not found in the cation - doped @xmath22 where the dopants are immobile and  frozen  in their position . for @xmath19 ,",
    "one superconducting transition was observed in the miscibility gap with a @xmath23 , almost independent of @xmath17.@xcite at higher doping level only one crystalline structure ( fmmm ) was detected@xcite but also evidence for the formation of superstructures by the interstitial oxygen was reported.@xcite oxygen ordering along the c - axis ( staging)@xcite as well as in the ab - plane@xcite were consequently proposed .",
    "it is interesting to note that the superconducting transition in this regime of the phase diagram ( i.e. for @xmath24 ) proceeds in two well - defined steps at 30 k and 15 k with no corresponding evolution of two chemical phases suggesting the possibility of an electronic phase separation into two distinct superconducting phases.@xcite    different physical and chemical methods of superoxygenation of @xmath25 have been employed .",
    "originally high - pressure oxygen annealing was used to increase the o - content up to @xmath26 in @xmath25.@xcite however , electrochemical intercalation of oxygen has been proven to be superior to all other methods of oxidization@xcite because of the low reaction temperature ( close to room temperature ) , the higher oxygenation level ( @xmath27 ) that can be achieved , and the precise measurement and control of the doping level .",
    "we have carefully studied various electrochemical techniques and shown that samples so prepared are close to thermodynamic equilibrium for @xmath28 with a superconducting transition at @xmath29 as long as the intercalation rate was low .",
    "high intercalation rates , in particular for @xmath24 , resulted in nonequilibrium samples with @xmath14 up to @xmath30  @xmath31.@xcite however , slow electrochemical oxidation followed by thermal annealing at @xmath32{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion c$ ] allows the samples to relax close to equilibrium and @xmath14 decreases to about @xmath33 .",
    "outside the miscibility gap for @xmath24 a second superconducting transition with @xmath34 develops with annealing resulting in the two - step transition as described in the previous paragraph.@xcite    the appearance of different phases with increasing oxygen content is obviously related to the interstitial mobile oxygen ions and can not be observed in the cation - doped @xmath22 .",
    "the strong correlation of the negatively charged @xmath35 ions with the hole carriers in the cu - o planes is expected to result in a cooperative behavior and the interesting features like chemical and electronic phase separation , oxygen ordering etc .",
    "reported in recent works . however , the driving force and the microscopic mechanism for these phenomena are still a matter of discussion . based on a theoretical study of the phase diagram of a two - dimensional t - j model including the nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion emery et",
    "al.@xcite suggested that electronic phase separation into hole rich and hole poor phases may be a general property of 2d hole like systems . in this case , the mobile oxygen in @xmath19 plays an essential role by compensating the repulsion between holes in the hole - rich regions and facilitating the charge separation .",
    "on the other hand , there is the possibility that the oxygen ions cause the separation into different ( oxygen - rich and -poor ) phases affecting the local hole density in the cu - o planes . to separate and to distinguish between these two scenarios the hole density , @xmath18 , and the oxygen content , @xmath17 , ought to be controlled independently .",
    "this major goal can be achieved by cation / anion co - doping in the system @xmath15 .",
    "starting with a fixed sr content , @xmath16 , in the parent compound and tuning the oxygen doping , @xmath17 , by electrochemical intercalation the degree of cation- and anion - doping can be varied at will and the hole concentration can be controlled precisely . in order to compare samples with the same hole concentrations but different oxygen content the doping efficiency of sr and o has to be known .",
    "we have calibrated the doping efficiency of pure oxygen and oxygen / strontium co - doped samples . whereas each sr ion adds one hole",
    "the doping efficiency of oxygen has been shown to change with the hole density.@xcite below @xmath36 each oxygen ion dopes exactly two holes into the planes as is expected from the formal valency @xmath35 . however , for @xmath37 the doping efficiency of the oxygen decreases to 1.3 holes per o - ion .",
    "hall measurements have shown that for @xmath37 the additional holes partially occupy localized states and do not increase the hall number.@xcite for the sr co - doped compound the oxygen doping efficiency reduces from 2 to 1.3 at exactly the same critical hole density , @xmath38 , indicating that the o doping efficiency is controlled by the total hole density , i.e. by the electronic state . therefore , the total hole density in @xmath39 is determined by @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath37 ) , respectively .",
    "@xcite    pressure is known to increase @xmath14 in most of the under - doped high @xmath14 materials .",
    "in @xmath43 it was found that the increase of @xmath14 with pressure is enhanced by pressure - induced ordering of the oxygen ions occupying the incompletely filled chain sites.@xcite this effect is particularly large in the far under - doped region .",
    "another compound where pressure ( applied at ambient temperature ) changes the oxygen configuration with a crucial impact on the superconducting properties is the overdoped @xmath44.@xcite whereas in the two former compounds pressure is assumed to affect the hole density in the active cuo - layer by transferring charges between the charge reservoir block and the cuo - planes this mechanism does not apply to the la-214 high-@xmath45 compound .",
    "in fact , from hall measurements at high pressures it was concluded that the average carrier density in @xmath19 does not change with the application of pressure.@xcite the pressure effect on superoxygenated @xmath19 has previously been studied with inconsistent pressure coefficients of @xmath14 for various samples prepared and doped by high - pressure oxygen annealing as well as electrochemical intercalation .",
    "@xcite we believe that early results were plagued by the problem of non - equilibrium samples .",
    "we , therefore , conducted a careful investigation of the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the @xmath14 and the superconducting states of the strontium and oxygen co - doped la-214 system , @xmath15 .",
    "the goal of this work is twofold : ( i ) phase separation in the correlated hole - oxygen system has already been reported under ambient conditions.@xcite the effect of pressure on the superconducting state and the phase diagram as a function of hole concentration is of primary interest . to probe the underlying driving mechanism of phase separation pressure",
    "is changed at ambient as well as at low temperature ( where oxygen motion is inhibited ) .",
    "( ii ) the pressure effect on samples with different oxygen content , @xmath17 , but the same hole density , @xmath18 , are compared to extract the most relevant parameter determining the nature of the superconducting state .",
    "pressure is used as a tool to characterize the electronic state at a given @xmath46 .",
    "we find that samples , both under ambient and high pressures , with different @xmath17 and @xmath16 behave very similarly if compared at the same hole concentration .",
    "this indicates that the observed phase separation , although supported by the mobile oxygen ions , is primarily of electronic nature .",
    "@xmath22 was prepared by standard solid state reaction from oxides and subsequently oxidized by electrochemical intercalation as described elsewhere.@xcite after the electrochemical oxidization all samples were annealed at @xmath47{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion c$ ] in oxygen for a period of 24 to 200 h. samples with different sr content , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and excess oxygen @xmath50were prepared and investigated at ambient and high pressure .",
    "dc magnetic susceptibility measurements using a quantum design squid were employed to characterize the superconducting transition at ambient pressure . for the high pressure experiments the ac susceptibility technique was used .",
    "a dual coil system was mounted to the ceramic samples and the highly sensitive low - frequency ( 19 hz ) lr 700 ( linear research ) mutual inductance bridge was used for the measurements .",
    "the magnitude of the ac magnetic field was estimated to about 2 to 4 oe . in one series of experiments hydrostatic pressure ( @xmath51 )",
    "was applied at room temperature by a standard piston - cylinder beryllium - copper clamp inserted into a liquid helium dewar for cooling .",
    "fluorinert fc77 ( 3 m ) was used as pressure transmitting medium .",
    "the temperature was measured using either a k - type thermocouple inside the teflon - pressure cell or , below 50 k , by a germanium thermometer mounted in the beryllium - copper clamp close to the sample position .",
    "the pressure was measured in - situ at about @xmath52 by monitoring the @xmath14-shift of a high purity ( 99.9999 % ) lead manometer .",
    "a second series of experiments was conducted measuring the same samples in a he - gas pressure cell ( @xmath53 , unipress ) inserted into a variable temperature cryostat ( cryo - industries of america ) .",
    "gas pressure was transmitted from a @xmath54 gas compressor ( u11 , unipress ) through a beryllium - copper capillary ( i d 0.3 mm ) .",
    "pressure can be changed at any temperature above the freezing temperature of the helium pressure medium . in particular ,",
    "pressure was changed at low temperature where the interstitial oxygen is immobile .",
    "the temperature was controlled by pre - heated he gas in the cryostat and measured by a thermocouple inside the pressure cell as well as by two thermometers attached to the top and the bottom of the cell .",
    "special care has been taken to avoid freezing of the helium in the capillary before it solidifies in the pressure cell .",
    "the pressure was measured using two manometers .",
    "a manganin gauge indicated the pressure at room temperature in the high - pressure chamber of the gas compressor .",
    "a second ( semiconductor ) manometer was mounted close to the sample inside the pressure cell .",
    "as long as the helium in the system is liquid both manometers yield identical readings as expected . however , if the helium solidifies in the pressure cell ( this happens e.g. at @xmath55 for @xmath56 or at @xmath57 for @xmath58 ) @xcite the in - situ semiconductor gauge is extremely valuable to detect the pressure drop during freezing and any possible blockage of the capillary .",
    "we have found that even in the solid state of the pressure medium the internal gauge still yields reliable pressure readings following the known isochore of the helium solid.@xcite data were taken during cooling and heating through the superconducting transitions .",
    "the cooling speed between room temperature and @xmath59 was very slow ( typically @xmath60 ) in order to maintain exactly the same conditions for all experiments .",
    "this is particularly important for doping levels where chemical phase separations occur because it was shown that in this range the superconducting transition temperature may depend on the cooling rate.@xcite however , any kinetic process leading to phase separations slows down at low temperature and prevents the sample to reach true thermodynamic equilibrium at temperatures close to @xmath14 .",
    "we have tested various cooling procedures with speeds below @xmath61 and found no appreciable change in the superconducting properties .",
    "therefore , we conclude that with the chosen procedure the samples are as close to thermodynamic equilibrium as one can get .",
    "the dc susceptibility , @xmath62 , was measured and compared with the real part of the ambient pressure ac susceptibility , @xmath63 .",
    "although we did not attempt to extract the superconducting volume fraction from the ac measurements we could show that the relative temperature dependence of @xmath64 is comparable to that of @xmath62 .",
    "the results obtained by the ac method for @xmath19 reproduced our earlier dc data.@xcite a single superconducting transition ( @xmath65 ) observed for low doping ( @xmath66 ) turns into a two - step transition ( @xmath14 s at about @xmath67 and @xmath33 ) upon increasing @xmath17 .",
    "this effect was interpreted as a doping - induced electronic phase separation of two intrinsic superconducting states . at @xmath68 ( corresponding to the hole concentration @xmath69 ) the superconducting volume fraction of the @xmath70 phase",
    "is greatly diminished but that of the @xmath71 phase is not changed.@xcite  this results in a fast drop of the onset-@xmath14 for superconductivity from about 30 k to 15 k at this special hole concentration in analogy to the so called 1/8 anomaly in the @xmath72-system . the phase diagram and some typical ac - susceptibility curves",
    "are schematically shown in fig . 1 as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "also shown in the bottom half of the figure are the same data for the sr co - doped system , @xmath73 .",
    "the qualitative features of both systems are very similar .",
    "in particular , the transition from the one-@xmath14 to the two-@xmath14 regime in the diagram and the 1/8 anomaly happen at the same hole concentration , @xmath18 , but at different @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath46 here is the ",
    "nominal   total  carrier density determined by the equation in the introduction .",
    "theses results reconfirm that our samples are indeed close to equilibrium and the single- and double-@xmath14 behaviors are  intrinsic  properties of doped holes . in the very low doping region ( @xmath46 @xmath74 )",
    "there is a major difference between the two sets of samples .",
    "there is a single @xmath75 in @xmath76 whereas the @xmath14 of @xmath19 remains at @xmath33 even for the smallest @xmath17 .",
    "this change of @xmath14 is explained by the attraction of charge carriers to the  frozen  sr - ions . because of the random distribution of the cation - dopants the formation of @xmath77 phase",
    "is inhibited .",
    "the coulomb attraction between holes and sr - ions results in a more homogeneous distribution of carriers with a lower local hole density and the intrinsic @xmath75 phase is stabilized instead . in the following sections we discuss the pressure effects on the superconducting transitions in @xmath15 for various doping levels for the two characteristic regimes in the phase diagram ( fig",
    ". 1 ) and for samples with carrier density @xmath78 located right at the transition boundary ( shaded area in fig .",
    "the ac - susceptibility data for two typical samples with @xmath79 in the single @xmath77 regime are displayed for different pressures in fig .",
    "a ( @xmath80 ) and fig . 2 b ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the diamagnetic signal of @xmath63 shifts to higher temperature and allows for an accurate determination of the pressure coefficient of @xmath14 , defined as the onset of the diamagnetic drop .",
    "the pressure effect on @xmath82 is reversible upon increasing and decreasing pressure and reproducible in several pressure cycles .",
    "the pressure dependences of @xmath14 for both samples ( open circles ) and also for @xmath83 at higher oxygen doping , @xmath84 ( triangles ) and @xmath85 ( squares ) are shown in fig .",
    "the increase of @xmath86 is non - linear for small pressure but linear at larger pressure .",
    "the pressure coefficient ( in the linear high - pressure range ) is unusually large , @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "this is about three to four times larger than the @xmath89 of the cation - doped @xmath90@xcite and appears to be the largest pressure coefficient observed in a la-214 high-@xmath14 superconductor .",
    "an anomalous large @xmath89  ( up to 6 k / gpa ) was previously observed only near the 1/8 anomaly in the la 214 system where the ambient pressure @xmath14  is very low.@xcite  this huge pressure coefficient is obviously a consequence of the high mobility of the interstitial oxygen dopants . in the under - doped region",
    ", pressure is known to increase the transition temperature of high-@xmath14 superconductors , even in systems without mobile oxygen such as @xmath90 . for multi - layer compounds",
    "this effect was frequently attributed to a pressure induced increase of the average hole - density in the cu - o planes due to a charge transfer from a charge reservoir block to the active layer . however , in the structure of la-214 there is no charge reservoir and the average hole concentration does not change with pressure .",
    "one possibility to stabilize superconductivity and to increase @xmath14 is the phase separation into hole - rich and hole - poor phases . at ambient conditions ,",
    "this phase separation in @xmath19 results in phases with low and high oxygen content and different lattice structures for low doping ( @xmath66 ) and in the coexistence of two superconducting phases ( @xmath75 and @xmath33 ) for higher doping levels ( @xmath24).@xcite under pressure the higher @xmath77 state is favored and , with the support of the mobile oxygen ions , @xmath14 may increase up to a rate of@xmath91 .",
    "in contrast , in the cation - doped system , @xmath90 , the random distribution of the immobile dopants prevents the hole system from phase separation due to pinning of holes close to the randomly distributed dopant sites .",
    "this explains the far lower pressure effect on @xmath14 in that system . for the oxygen doped as well as the oxygen - sr co -",
    "doped la-214 cuprate the pressure induces a redistribution of the strongly correlated interstitial oxygen and hole system .",
    "this results in a stabilization of the superconducting phase and the large @xmath89 observed in our experiments .",
    "similar effects have been reported in high - pressure experiments on under - doped ybco@xcite and may be due to the same underlying microscopic mechanisms .    in the high hole density ( @xmath92 )",
    "regime where we found two superconducting transitions with @xmath75 and @xmath77 coexisting at ambient pressure , the effect of pressure on the two transitions is of particular interest .",
    "4 shows the temperature dependence of the ac - susceptibility at different pressures for two typical samples with @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the typical two - step characteristics of @xmath96 is preserved under pressure but the critical temperatures for both transitions are pushed into opposite direction , i.e. @xmath97 increases and @xmath98 decreases with pressure .",
    "note that @xmath97 is defined as the onset of the diamagnetic drop of @xmath96 and @xmath98 is determined from the bending of the susceptibility curve as shown in the lower right graph of fig .",
    "1 ( dotted lines ) . thereby , under high pressure @xmath97 has the same pressure coefficient as that of @xmath66 samples ( see e.g. fig .",
    "3 b ) suggesting that it is the same superconducting state .",
    "@xmath99 is negative and of the order of @xmath100 .",
    "we conclude that pressure enhances the electronic phase separation between the two superconducting phases because of a redistribution of charges and dopants in the coupled hole - oxygen system .",
    "the @xmath33 phase becomes more stabilized at the expense of the @xmath71 state .",
    "the pressure induced changes to the hole distribution may result in a change of the superconducting volume fractions of both phases but also in a change of the hole density of each superconducting phase .",
    "the superconducting volume fraction can not be extracted from ac susceptibility measurements but it would be accessible by measuring the dc susceptibility ( meissner effect ) under high pressure . however , a sole change of the volume fractions of both ( @xmath71 and @xmath33 ) phases should not affect the transition temperatures",
    ". therefore , it appears more likely that pressure changes the local hole density of the two phases , for example , by increasing the hole concentration of the @xmath33 phase and reducing the hole density of the @xmath71 phase .",
    "this might explain the change of both @xmath14 s , however , the current experiments can not provide information about the local hole concentrations .",
    "we also can not exclude the possibility that the 15 k phase might be overdoped resulting in a negative pressure coefficient of @xmath14 as known for many high-@xmath14 compounds .",
    "however , the cation doped la-214 system was shown to exhibit a positive @xmath101 even for doping levels well above the optimum.@xcite as we will see in the following section the rearrangement of charges is suppressed by freezing the interstitial oxygen ions in their ambient pressure positions .    the pressure effect in the transition region ( shaded area in fig .",
    "1 ) located at @xmath78 is of special interest .",
    "the ambient pressure susceptibility at this special hole density shows one single transition at @xmath23 ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "however , fig .",
    "5 shows that under hydrostatic pressure this transition splits into two indicating that the electronic phase separation can be induced by pressure .",
    "the relevant parameter for this effect is the hole density , @xmath18 .",
    "figures 5 a and b compare two data sets for @xmath19 and @xmath73 at almost the same @xmath102 , but different oxygen content .",
    "the pressure induced phase separation into the @xmath71 and @xmath33 superconducting phases is obvious in both , the oxygen doped and the sr - oxygen co - doped samples . however , if both compounds are compared at the same @xmath17 but slightly different hole density ( fig . 5 a and c ) , the pressure effect on the superconducting transition is qualitatively different .",
    "the splitting into two transitions is induced by pressure in @xmath103 but not in @xmath80 .",
    "this result indicates that the separation into two @xmath14 s is hole driven .",
    "if those two @xmath14 s were due to two distinct chemical phases then we expect to observe the two @xmath14 s behavior in samples with same oxygen content , e.g. in @xmath80 too .",
    "the small increase of hole density due to the co - doping with sr triggers the interesting pressure effect at this special carrier density .",
    "this observation , coupled to the fact that all samples are close to thermal equilibrium and behave similarly at the same carrier density , leads us to the conclusion that the hole density dictates the superconducting properties of @xmath15 and indeed the two characteristic regimes are separated by a critical hole density @xmath104 .",
    "the observed phase separations at ambient and high pressures are driven by the system of holes and are facilitated by the rearrangement of the mobile interstitial oxygen ions .",
    "it should be noted that all these effects can not be observed in cation - doped @xmath105 because of the random distribution of the immobile dopant ions .",
    "due to the coulomb interaction between holes and dopant ions the hole distribution in the cu - o planes is affected by the dopants and electronic phase separation into hole - rich and hole - poor phases is inhibited .",
    "the pressure effects on the @xmath71 transition in @xmath73 ( for @xmath106 or @xmath107 ) collaborates with our picture . from the former discussion",
    "it could be expected that pressure induces the phase separation into the hole rich ( @xmath108 ) and hole poor ( non - superconducting ) phases .",
    "in fact , the ac - susceptibility data of @xmath109 shown in fig . 6 for pressures up to @xmath110 indicate that pressure rapidly increases the @xmath14 from @xmath67 to above @xmath33 .",
    "the details of this transition are clearly seen in the derivative , @xmath111 , displayed in fig . 6b . at ambient pressure ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "6 ) @xmath111 exhibits a single maximum close to @xmath71 as indication of the diamagnetic drop of @xmath112 .",
    "this maximum is shifted to higher temperature with increasing pressure ( top part of fig .",
    "6b ) . above @xmath113",
    "a shoulder appears in the temperature dependence of @xmath111 at about @xmath33 .",
    "this shoulder corresponds to a small diamagnetic signal in @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "6a ) and is interpreted as the pressure induced growth of the hole - rich @xmath33 phase observed at the same hole density in @xmath19 .",
    "the sudden appearance of this @xmath77 state instead of a continuous increase of   @xmath14 from @xmath71 to @xmath33 clearly demonstrate that there were two distinct intrinsic @xmath14 s in this system . with further increasing pressure",
    "this phase is growing ( the shoulder extends to a major peak in @xmath114 , bottom part of fig .",
    "6b ) and becomes the major superconducting phase in the sample .",
    "there is a narrow pressure range ( @xmath115 ) where both phases coexist and the @xmath111 curve exhibits two separated maxima . since we have seen that the @xmath33 transition is favored under pressure , mobile oxygen dopants now facilitate the phase separation into hole - rich and hole - poor phases similar to the @xmath25 system .",
    "this interesting pressure effect has been observed in @xmath76 for several samples with @xmath116 .    to prove the conclusion of this section and to collect additional evidence for the role of interstitial oxygen we investigate the pressure effects while oxygen ions are immobile .",
    "the mobility of the interstitial oxygen is greatly reduced and the ions are literally frozen in their positions if the temperature is reduced to below @xmath117 . changing pressure at low temperature will allow us to separate the pressure effect on the electronic state from the effect of electronic phase separation facilitated by mobile oxygen ions .",
    "the low - temperature pressure change can be achieved by employing a helium gas - pressure cell connected to a gas compressor . for several typical @xmath19 and @xmath73 samples the pressure effects ( at @xmath118 )",
    "were investigated using three basic procedures :    \\(i ) pressure up to @xmath119 was applied at room temperature and released in several steps at low temperature .",
    "ac - susceptibility measurements through the superconducting transition were conducted at each pressure step below @xmath120 .",
    "\\(ii ) following the release of pressure below @xmath121 according to procedure ( i ) the samples were re - heated to room temperature so that the mobile oxygen could re - arrange .",
    "samples were cooled again ( without changing pressure ) through the superconducting transition .",
    "the comparison of the two measurements shows the sole effect of interstitial oxygen redistribution on @xmath45 .",
    "\\(iii ) samples were cooled to low temperature at ambient pressure .",
    "pressure was increased below 100 k and the ac - susceptibility was measured for each pressure .",
    "the pressure shift of @xmath97 is shown in fig . 7 for a typical sample in the low hole density region , @xmath81 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the pressure in this experiment was raised to @xmath119 at room temperature and released at low @xmath123 . during cooling the pressure drops to about @xmath124 at the freezing temperature of the helium pressure medium , @xmath125 .",
    "a further pressure decrease to @xmath126 at@xmath127 is due to the volume reduction and the isochoric change of state of the solid helium .",
    "the @xmath128 coincides with the previous measurements ( fig .",
    "2 b ) and decreases with decreasing pressure at a rate of @xmath129 . this rate is less than @xmath130 of that estimated in the previous section for the same sample ( fig .",
    "after heating the sample to room temperature and cooling again @xmath14 is further reduced by @xmath131 ( inset in fig .",
    ". this additional change of @xmath14 is a pure effect of oxygen redistribution since pressure was not changed .",
    "this shows that the hole - oxygen system was frozen in a meta - stable state after the release of pressure at low temperature and could only relax towards thermal equilibrium after the temperature was raised high enough to allow the oxygen diffusion . repeating the measurement according to procedure ( iii ) the increase of pressure from @xmath132 at low temperature results in a similar shift of @xmath14 at the rate of about @xmath133 in good agreement with",
    "the value of @xmath134 mentioned above .",
    "we conducted the same series of gas - pressure experiments with the oxygen - doped @xmath80 ( @xmath135 ) and found very similar results .",
    "again , the observed pressure coefficient of @xmath136 @xmath137 was strongly reduced with respect to the value of @xmath138 found in section 3.2 for this sample ( see also fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that the reduced @xmath89 is comparable to the pressure coefficient of the cation - doped @xmath139 ( @xmath140 to @xmath133 ) and slightly larger than @xmath101 for @xmath22 ( @xmath141 ) for the doping region not too close to the 1/8 anomaly.@xcite therefore , we conclude that this pressure coefficient of @xmath142 @xmath143 should be considered as the pressure effect of the @xmath97transition under the  hard - doping  ,",

    "was varied below @xmath121 between @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",

    "the superconducting properties of the sample changed and , in particular , @xmath98 increased by about @xmath151 restoring the original ambient pressure curve @xmath152 .",
    "very similar data have been obtained for oxygen - doped samples with @xmath144 , e.g. @xmath153 .",
    "the freezing of the oxygen ions at low temperature prevents the pressure induced enhancement of electronic phase separation as observed in the experiments described in the previous section .",
    "thermodynamically , the system behaves more like @xmath105 under pressure .",
    "the major difference is the inhomogeneous hole - oxygen distribution in @xmath15 we start with at ambient conditions .",
    "the degree of phase separation already present at ambient t is frozen and preserved at low temperature and can not be changed by pressure .    for @xmath78 ( shaded area in fig .",
    "1 ) we have shown that pressure applied at room temperature facilitates oxygen diffusion and induces the electronic phase separation . however , if oxygen is frozen at low @xmath123 and pressure is changed below @xmath121 we expect that the initial ( room temperature ) state is preserved . fig .",
    "9 shows the pressure effect on @xmath82 for @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) . in the first experiment",
    "low pressure ( @xmath156 ) was applied at room temperature and the sample was cooled to low @xmath123 ( dotted curve 1 in fig . 9 a ) .",
    "then pressure was increased ( below 100 k ) to about 0.5 gpa ( solid curve 2 in fig . 9 a ) .",
    "the susceptibility curve shifts in parallel to higher temperature at a rate of @xmath157 .",
    "no broadening or splitting of the transition is observed . in the second experiment we applied @xmath146 at room temperature .",
    "the superconducting transition broadens ( dotted curve , fig .",
    "9 b ) and indicates the tendency to splitting into two transitions due to the phase separation as seen in the previous section ( fig . 5 a and b ) .",
    "the release of pressure at low @xmath123 to @xmath156 does not change the width or the shape of the diamagnetic susceptibility signal ( curve 2 , fig .",
    "the phase separation induced by pressure at high temperature is preserved .",
    "however , @xmath14shifts by about @xmath140 to @xmath158 . heating the sample at @xmath156 to room temperature recovers the original ( one - transition ) state ( curve 3 , fig .",
    "9 b which is comparable with curve 1 , fig . 9 a ) due to the rearrangement of the interstitial oxygen and hole system towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "in section iii b we have shown that in @xmath159 high pressure ( applied at room temperature ) induced the @xmath33 superconducting state at the expense of the @xmath71 phase . to show that this effect is also related to the rearrangement of the interstitial oxygen we measured the pressure effect using the he gas pressure apparatus .",
    "the experiment starts with applying high pressure of @xmath160 at ambient temperature .",
    "the ac susceptibility clearly shows the emerging @xmath33 phase at low temperature as indicated by the shoulder in the derivative , @xmath161 , close to @xmath33 ( curve 1 , dotted line in fig .",
    "10 ) . although the pressure is not high enough to show the larger effect as in fig .",
    "6 the data are in good agreement with the clamp cell experiments at the same pressure . after releasing pressure completely ( curve 2 in fig .",
    "10 ) the @xmath33 phase still survives at about the same amount . only after heating the sample to room temperature ( curve 3 , fig .",
    "10 ) the oxygen ions and the holes rearrange and the @xmath33 phase disappears again .",
    "this effect can only be explained by considering the pressure induced change of the interstitial oxygen distribution .",
    "high pressure stabilizes the hole - oxygen rich phase with a higher ( @xmath33 ) @xmath14 . after cooling to below @xmath121 and",
    "pressure release the clustered oxygen ions can not relax to their zero - pressure thermal equilibrium distribution .",
    "pinning the holes to the @xmath35-rich regions the amount of the @xmath33 phase is preserved . however , this state is not in global thermal equilibrium .",
    "raising the temperature to ambient the diffusion of oxygen is initiated and the hole - oxygen system relaxes closer to equilibrium .",
    "now the hole system is affected by the randomly distributed and fixed sr - ions and the @xmath71 state dominates the superconducting properties .",
    "the pressure effect on the superconducting transitions of electrochemically doped @xmath15 was investigated for @xmath162 with various @xmath17 .",
    "we show a strong correlation between the hole carriers and the dopants .",
    "cation- and oxygen - doping are characteristically different .",
    "hard - doping using strontium creates a correlated dopant - hole state and inhibits the macroscopic phase separation .",
    "soft - doping using mobile interstitial oxygen , however , facilitates the tendency to phase separation into hole - rich and hole - poor phases .",
    "accordingly , @xmath39 shows a rich phase diagram as function of doping . in particular , two characteristic regimes can be distinguished .",
    "one superconducting transition ( @xmath65 ) is observed in the low doping regime but two successive transitions at about @xmath71 and @xmath33 appear in the higher doping regime .",
    "for the two different sets of samples with @xmath48 and @xmath49 the two regimes are separated by a critical hole density , @xmath78 .",
    "the sr co - doped @xmath73 shows a correlated superconducting phase at low hole density ( @xmath107 ) with a lower @xmath163 due to the hole pinning effect of the sr ions .",
    "pressure applied at room temperature increases the @xmath33 transition temperature , @xmath97 , at an unusually high rate of 9 to 10 k / gpa .",
    "in addition , the tendency to electronic phase separation is strongly enhanced by pressure as indicated by the large positive @xmath164 and a negative pressure coefficient of the 15 k transition temperature , @xmath165 . it was shown that , for the special hole density @xmath104 , pressure induces the phase separation into the two superconducting phases for both strontium contents , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the data are interpreted as a cooperative effect of pressure on the electronic state facilitating the phase separation and the re - arrangement of the interstitial oxygen which enhances the original pressure effect .",
    "we conclude that the electronic state of carefully annealed oxygen - intercalated la-214 is closer to thermal equilibrium due to the missing frustration of immobile dopant ions .",
    "the latter conclusion is further supported by a series of experiments where pressure was varied at low temperature ( below @xmath121 ) inhibiting any oxygen diffusion .",
    "the pressure coefficients of @xmath14 appeared to be much smaller ( @xmath166 ) and comparable with the cation - doped @xmath105 indicating that the lower @xmath89 is an effect of charge pinning*. * it was also shown that pressure , if changed at low temperature , did neither enhance the tendency of phase separation observed for @xmath144 nor induce phase separation at the special hole concentration of @xmath78 .",
    "we suppose that the immobile interstitial oxygen at low temperature act similarly as the ( randomly distributed ) sr - cations which may explain the reduced pressure effect on the electronic hole system .",
    "it is interesting to note that the crossover from the single to double transition region in the phase diagram as well as the pressure effects discussed above appear at the same hole density for both systems , @xmath25 and @xmath76 , considered in this investigation .",
    "this implies that the  total  hole density is the relevant parameter determining the nature of the superconducting states as well as the pressure effects on it . for higher strontium contents",
    ", however , effects of coulomb interaction with the sr ions have to be taken into account .",
    "the results obtained at ambient and high pressure provide strong evidence for the importance of the interaction of holes and dopants in high temperature superconductors .",
    "soft- dopants , like interstitial oxygen in la-214 or chain oxygen in ybco , may facilitate the phase separation into hole rich and hole poor phases .",
    "thermodynamically , soft - dopants and holes should be considered as one global correlated system relaxing towards thermodynamic equilibrium at high enough temperatures .",
    "hard - dopants , however , cause pinning of holes and prevent the electronic system from phase separation into phases with different hole densities .    as a final note , while electronic phase separation in a very low doping regime can be understood in terms of emery s picture,@xcite the phase separations we observed in such high doping level is especially peculiar because the system is electronically phase separated into two dictinct @xmath14 s .",
    "this suggests that a distinct electronic structure exists for each different @xmath14 and it starts to form at a temperature above 200 k."
