    "polarisabilities quantify in detail the two - photon response of the charge and current distributions of the effective low - energy degrees of freedom inside the nucleon to external electro - magnetic fields , see e.g.  @xcite for reviews .",
    "in particular at hi@xmath23s  @xcite , mami  @xcite and maxlab  @xcite , a host of compton scattering experiments on the proton , deuteron and @xmath24he are planned or under way to test the predictions of theories and models .",
    "the goal of this article is to support and trigger experimental planning and analysis by a model - independent assessment of the sensitivity of elastic deuteron compton scattering observables with polarised beams and/or targets at energies @xmath25 on nucleon polarisabilities .",

    "they are canonically parameterised starting from the most general interaction between the nucleon @xmath26 with spin @xmath27 and an electro - magnetic field of fixed , non - zero energy @xmath28 in the centre - of - mass ( cm ) frame , see e.g.  @xcite : @xmath29\\;n    \\label{eq : pols - lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the electric or magnetic photon undergoes a transition @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) of definite multipolarity @xmath32 ; @xmath33 .",

    "the static values themselves , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are non - zero and often simply called `` the polarisabilities '' .    in elastic deuteron compton scattering @xmath45 ( see  @xcite for a review ) only the average nucleon polarisabilities @xmath46 etc .",
    "are directly accessible , since the deuteron is an iso - scalar .",
    "a recent analysis of all elastic deuteron compton scattering data in chiral effective field theory @xmath47eftwith dynamical @xmath0 degrees of freedom quotes  @xcite @xmath48 the error - bars represent uncertainties in the baldin sum rule , statistics , and higher - order effects in the systematic @xmath47eftexpansion .",

    "lattice qcd simulations at pion masses which allow for chiral extrapolations are also pursued , albeit many hurdles have still to be overcome ; for recent progress , see  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the static values , the _ energy - dependent _ or _ dynamical polarisabilities _ are identified _ at fixed energy _ only by a multipole - analysis ,",
    "i.e.  by their different angular dependence in compton scattering  @xcite .",
    "while quite different frameworks could reproduce the zero - energy values , the underlying mechanisms are only properly revealed by investigating their energy - dependence .",
    "for example , detailed implications of chiral symmetry on the pion cloud as well as effects from the @xmath0 as lowest - lying nuclear excitation have a substantial impact in particular at energies around and above the pion mass , as demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "compton scattering on nucleons and light nuclei provides thus a wealth of information about the internal structure of the nucleon itself .    of particular interest",
    "are the four so far practically un - determined spin - polarisabilities .",
    "they parameterise the response of the nucleon _ spin _ to the photon field , in analogy to rotations of the polarisation plane of linearly polarised photons propagating through a medium in the presence of a constant magnetic field ( faraday effect ) . in the nucleon",
    ", the permanent magnetic moment of the nucleon spin provides the necessary magnetic background field .    for both",

    "the forward spin - polarisability is inferred as compatible with zero from a vpi - fa93 multipole analysis  @xcite of the gell - mann goldberger thirring sum rule  @xcite , from @xmath47eft  @xcite , or from fixed-@xmath54 dispersion relations  @xcite : @xmath59 the spread may be conservatively estimated as @xmath22 since both theoretical and experimental uncertainties are generally believed to be large , with for example @xmath47eftresults only poorly converging , see e.g.  @xcite for a more thorough discussion .",
    "neither linear combination allows one therefore to interpret the detailed dynamics of charges and currents in the nucleon . to test theories and models ,",
    "reliable experiments are needed which determine all polarisabilities with minimal theoretical bias , and theoretical uncertainties should be assessed with care .",
    "polarised compton scattering off the free proton and neutron has been studied in the same framework used here  @xcite .",
    "due to the lack of free neutron targets , compton scattering on the lightest nuclei is however the likely avenue to hunt for the elusive neutron polarisabilities .",
    "this work focuses therefore on identifying deuteron observables that help to extract the six iso - scalar nucleon polarisabilities .",
    "previous work on un - polarised deuteron compton scattering include calculations using traditional potential models  @xcite and @xmath47eft  @xcite , see e.g.  @xcite for an overview .",

    ", they are formally of higher order , @xmath75 .",
    "however , we follow refs .  @xcite in modifying the sse to account for the stark discrepancy between the experimental static spin - independent dipole polarisabilities and the @xmath66 sse values due to @xmath2 effects .",
    "these `` off - sets '' are determined by data as described below , but the energy- and isospin - dependence of the spin - independent polarisabilities are at this order predicted in sse @xmath47eft .",

    "the polarisabilities are uniquely extracted from the sum of contributions 2 to 5 , see  @xcite . while there is some ambiguity which makes it necessary to specify exactly how the `` pole '' and `` structure '' parts are divided , this artificial separation has of course no bearing on observables .",

    "in practise , the present formulation puts the pion - production threshold @xmath90 not at the exact kinematically correct position , but higher orders in @xmath67 include the deuteron recoil effects in perturbation . since the polarisabilities and observables around threshold are quite sensitive to the exact threshold position  @xcite , we limit the discussion to @xmath91 , where such effects are small .    by convoluting phenomenological wave - functions with interactions from eft , we follow a `` hybrid approach '' advocated by weinberg  @xcite . as in  @xcite ,",

    "future improvement in our deuteron compton scattering calculations include : transition to a chirally fully consistent deuteron wave - function and @xmath1-potential ; implementing the kinematically correct pion - production threshold to extend our reach into the @xmath2-resonance region ; and a detailed assessment of residual theoretical uncertainties .",
