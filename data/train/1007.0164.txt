    "the dynamics of the oceans is extremely complex due to nonlinear coupling across many scales of motion and the interplay between mean and fluctuating fields @xcite .",
    "although the oceans can be considered as  turbulent \" in a classical sense , their dynamics also involves wavelike phenomena and coherent structures ( vortices ) like monopoles , dipoles or modons , tripoles ... furthermore , despite the permanent action of forcing ( e.g. induced by the wind ) and dissipation , the oceans present a form of global organization .",
    "this is revealed in the existence of strong jets like the gulf stream or the kuroshio current and in the observation of a large - scale oceanic circulation .",
    "in order to understand the dynamics of the oceans , one possibility is to develop numerical codes with increasing complexity .",
    "however , the results can be affected by the method used to parameterize the small scales .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations alone do not explain the phenomena observed .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the physical output of such numerical simulations it can be useful to consider in parallel simple mathematical models that can be studied in great detail .",
    "these academic models can serve as a basis to develop general methods ( e.g. statistical mechanics , kinetic theories ) that can be relevant in more complicated situations .    early models of wind - induced oceanic circulation have been developed by stommel @xcite and munk @xcite but they are based on linearized equations and on an artificial concept of eddy viscosity . alternatively , in a seminal paper , fofonoff @xcite neglects forcing and dissipation and studies the case of a steady free circulation in a closed ocean .",
    "he considers quasi geostrophic ( qg ) flows on the @xmath1-plane , a common starting point for many dynamical studies in meteorology and oceanography .",
    "he furthermore assumes that the ocean has reached a steady state characterized by a linear relationship between potential vorticity @xmath4 and stream function @xmath3 ( here , @xmath5 denotes the topography and the ordinary @xmath1-effect corresponds to @xmath0 ) .",
    "finally , he considers an asymptotic regime of low energy and provides a simple analytical solution representing a westward jet with a recirculation at the boundary .",
    "this solution is now called _ fofonoff flow _ @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations starting from a random initial condition , in forced and unforced situations , show that the system can spontaneously generate a fofonoff flow characterized by a linear @xmath6 relationship @xcite .",
    "however , such a linear relationship is not expected to be general and more complex flows with nonlinear @xmath6 relationships can also be observed .",
    "we must keep in mind that fofonoff flows provide just an academic model of oceanic circulation with limited applications .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "several researchers have tried to justify the relevance of fofonoff flows . in real oceans , the flows are forced by the wind and dissipated at small scales .",
    "niiler @xcite and marshall & nurser @xcite have argued that forcing and dissipation could equilibrate each other in average and determine a quasi stationary state ( qss ) that is a steady state of the ideal qg equations ( with forcing and dissipation switched off ) . in these approaches ,",
    "the @xmath6 relationship is selected by the properties of forcing and dissipation and the conditions to have a linear relationship are sought . in the case of unforced oceans , the justification of a linear @xmath6 relationship has been first sought in a phenomenological minimum enstrophy principle .",
    "bretherton & haidvogel @xcite argue that potential enstrophy decays due to viscous effects ( see , however , appendix [ sec_visc ] ) while the energy and the circulation remain approximately conserved ( in the limit of small viscosity ) .",
    "they propose therefore that the system should reach a state that minimizes potential enstrophy at fixed energy and circulation .",
    "this leads to a linear @xmath6 relationship like for fofonoff flows .",
    "a linear @xmath6 relationship can also be justified from statistical mechanics . a statistical theory of 2d turbulence was first developed by kraichnan @xcite in spectral space .",
    "it is based on the truncated 2d euler equations which conserve only energy and enstrophy ( quadratic constraints ) . in the presence of a topography , salmon , holloway & hendershott @xcite",
    "show that this approach predicts a mean flow characterized by a linear relationship between the averaged potential vorticity @xmath7 and the averaged stream function @xmath8 .",
    "another statistical approach has been developed by miller @xcite and robert & sommeria @xcite in real space .",
    "this theory takes into account all the conservation laws ( energy and casimirs ) of the 2d euler equation and predicts various @xmath6 relationships depending on the initial conditions .",
    "however , in real situations where the system undergoes forcing and dissipation , the conservation of all the casimirs is abusive and has been criticized by ellis , haven & turkington @xcite and by chavanis @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite , we have proposed to conserve only a few microscopic moments of the vorticity among the infinite class of casimirs .",
    "these relevant constraints could be selected by the properties of forcing and dissipation .",
    "for example ,",
    "if we maximize the miller - robert - sommeria ( mrs ) entropy at fixed energy @xmath9 , circulation @xmath10 and microscopic potential enstrophy @xmath11 , we get a mean flow characterized by a linear @xmath12 relationship leading to fofonoff flows .",
    "this statistical approach also predicts gaussian fluctuations around this mean flow .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the maximization of mrs entropy at fixed energy , circulation and microscopic potential enstrophy @xmath11 is equivalent to the minimization of macroscopic potential enstrophy @xmath13 at fixed energy and circulation .",
    "this justifies an inviscid minimum potential enstrophy principle , and fofonoff flows , when only the microscopic enstrophy ( quadratic ) is conserved among the infinite class of casimirs .    the asymptotic limit treated by fofonoff @xcite corresponds to small energies @xmath9 , a limit relevant to oceanic situations . in the statistical theory",
    ", this corresponds to a regime of large positive inverse temperatures @xmath14 . in that case , the fofonoff solution is the unique ( global ) entropy maximum at fixed circulation and energy .",
    "on the other hand , chavanis & sommeria @xcite studied the case of a linear @xmath6 relationship in a rectangular domain without topography . for large energies @xmath9 , corresponding to sufficiently negative @xmath1 , they report the existence of multiple solutions .",
    "this leads to interesting phase transitions between monopoles and dipoles depending on the value of a single control parameter @xmath15 and on the geometry of the domain ( for example , the aspect ratio @xmath16 of a rectangular domain ) .",
    "for @xmath17 , the maximum entropy state is a monopole if @xmath18 and a dipole if @xmath19 . for @xmath20 , when @xmath21 the maximum entropy state is always a monopole and when @xmath19 , the maximum entropy state is a dipole for small values of @xmath22 and a monopole for large values of @xmath22 .",
    "the approach of chavanis & sommeria @xcite has been completed recently by venaille & bouchet @xcite who used a different theoretical formalism and provided a detailed discussion of phase transitions and ensemble inequivalence in qg flows with and without topography . for low values of the energy , they recover fofonoff flows @xcite and for large values of the energy , they obtain geometry induced phase transitions between monopoles and dipoles similar to those found by chavanis & sommeria @xcite .",
    "they also emphasize the notions of bicritical point and azeotropy .",
    "their approach is well - suited for statistical mechanics but it may appear a bit abstract to fluid mechanicians .",
    "by contrast , the approach of chavanis & sommeria @xcite is simpler . in the present paper",
    ", we shall extend the formalism of @xcite to the case of flows with a topography and study how the series of equilibria is modified in this more general context .",
    "we first consider an antisymmetric linear topography @xmath0 in a rectangular domain ( like in fofonoff s classical study ) and then generalize the results to the case of an arbitrary topography in an arbitrary domain .",
    "we recover and confirm the main results of venaille & bouchet @xcite and illustrate them with explicit calculations and with synthetic phase diagrams .",
    "we compute the full series of equilibria ( containing all the critical points of entropy at fixed energy and circulations ) while venaille & bouchet @xcite focus on global entropy maxima .",
    "the full series of equilibria is useful to show the relative position of the stable and unstable branches .",
    "furthermore , for systems with long - range interactions , metastable states ( local entropy maxima ) , and even saddle points of entropy , can be long - lived and therefore relevant in the dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to take them into account .",
    "we also give a special attention to the existence of a second order phase transition that exists only for a particular value of the circulation @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 for an antisymmetric topography ) and study how this phase transition takes birth as @xmath25 through the formation of a `` spike '' .",
    "finally , we introduce simple relaxation equations that converge towards the minimum potential enstrophy state at fixed circulation and energy and solve these equations numerically to illustrate the phase transitions in a rectangular oceanic basin with linear topography ( or @xmath1-effect ) .",
    "numerical integration of these equations with a nonlinear topography have been previously performed in @xcite and the present paper develops the theory required to interpret the results .",
    "we consider a 2d incompressible flow over a topography described by the quasigeostrophic ( qg ) equations @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the potential vorticity , @xmath5 the topography , @xmath28 the rossby radius , @xmath29 the vorticity , @xmath3 the stream function and @xmath30 the velocity field ( @xmath31 is a unit vector normal to the flow ) . for illustration and explicit calculations , we shall consider a linear topography of the form @xmath0 .",
    "this term can equivalently be interpreted as a `` @xmath1-effect '' in the oceans due to the earth s sphericity .",
    "the qg equations admit an infinite number of steady states of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an arbitrary function .",
    "they are obtained by solving the differential equation @xmath34 with @xmath35 on the domain boundary .",
    "the qg equations conserve the energy @xmath36 and an infinite number of integral constraints that are the casimirs @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an arbitrary function .",
    "in particular , all the moments of the potential vorticity @xmath39 are conserved .",
    "the first moment @xmath40 is the potential circulation and the second moment @xmath41 is the potential enstrophy .",

    "we can also justify an _",

    "furthermore , the friction coefficient is given by an einstein - type formula @xmath462 involving the diffusion coefficient and the inverse temperature .",
    "at equilibrium , @xmath463 this equation can be directly derived from the relation @xmath464 determining the steady states of eq .",

    "this is equivalent to neglecting the laplacian in the fundamental differential equation @xmath487 .",
    "this leads to @xmath488 , equivalent to @xmath489 and @xmath486 .",
    "as we have seen , this corresponds to the standard fofonoff @xcite flows that are completely determined by the topography ( far from the boundaries ) .",
    "more generally , eq . ( [ nept15 ] ) takes into account finite temperature effects that can induce deviations to the standard fofonoff flows",
    ". these finite temperature effects ( corresponding to sufficiently high energies ) are precisely those that have been described in this paper .    in conclusion ,",
    "the relaxation equation ( [ two16 ] ) derived from the maximum entropy production principle ( mepp ) @xcite is relatively consistent with the oceanographic parametrization of holloway @xcite , especially when the ( generalized ) entropy is the neg - enstrophy .",
    "this is interesting because the parametrization of holloway @xcite has been used in realistic oceanic modeling where the neptune effect was shown to play a significant role .",

    "relaxation equations for two - dimensional flows have been introduced by robert & sommeria @xcite in the context of the mrs statistical theory and extended by chavanis @xcite to more general situations .",
    "these relaxation equations are relatively _ ad hoc _ since they are solely based on general `` principles '' similar to the first and second principles of thermodynamics : conservation of energy ( and possibly other constraints ) and increase of an `` entropic '' functional .",
    "contrary to the boltzmann equation , the relaxation equations are not derived from first principles but just assumed .",
    "this is the reason why they exist in different forms .",
    "there is no general consensus about the importance and interest of these relaxation equations .",
    "some researchers argue that they are useless and that they have no physical relevance .",
    "other workers , on the other hand , consider that they are interesting for the following reasons :    \\(i ) they can be used as _ numerical algorithms _ to solve maximization problems of the form ( [ dim ] ) with a general `` entropic functional '' of the form ( [ dims ] ) .",
    "this maximization problem can have various interpretations ( as explained in section [ sec_inter ] and in @xcite ) related to thermodynamical and/or nonlinear dynamical stability of 2d euler flows .",
    "although the case of a quadratic functional ( [ f2 ] ) can be treated analytically ( as done in our paper ) , the general maximization problem ( [ dim])-([dims ] ) is more complex and the relaxation equations can be a way ( among others ) to solve it .",
    "indeed , it is generally difficult to directly solve the euler - lagrange equations associated with ( [ dim])-([dims ] ) and be sure that the critical points are entropy maxima .",
    "by contrast , the relaxation equations guarantee ( by construction ) that the relaxed state is an entropy maximum with appropriate constraints .",
    "furthermore , when several entropy maxima ( metastable states ) exist for the same values of the constraints , the relaxation equations can tell which ( local ) maximum will be reached by a given initial condition , thus unveiling its _ basin of attraction_. finally , by introducing in the relaxation equations a variable diffusion coefficient ( related to the local fluctuations of vorticity ) , we can take into account the important effects of _ incomplete relaxation _ and lack of ergodicity @xcite .",
    "this is not possible if we consider just equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "\\(ii ) they provide non trivial _ dynamical systems _ , consistent with the equilibrium states , whose mathematical study is interesting in its own right .",
    "for example , we have observed that the system can remain blocked for a long time in an unstable state before finally reaching the maximum entropy state .",
    "although this effect might be an artefact of the relaxation equations , the same phenomenon could also occur in more realistic parametrizations .",
    "therefore , the study of the relaxation equations can suggest interesting ideas and developments .",
    "\\(iii ) the discussion of appendix [ sec_nept ] shows that the relaxation equations are remarkably consistent with the parametrization of holloway @xcite based on relatively different arguments .",
    "this is a hint that our _ parametrization _ may contain ingredients that capture some features of real oceanic circulation .",
    "for example , holloway has shown that the neptune effect plays some role in the dynamics of the oceans . therefore",
    ", making contact between the two approaches is of interest .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to include other geophysical effects in the relaxation equations such as wind forcing like in kazantsev _"
