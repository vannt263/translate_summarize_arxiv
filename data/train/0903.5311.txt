    "it is well known that quasi - bound states manifest themselves as poles in the scattering matrix , and as breit - wigner resonances in the scattering amplitude .",
    "chandrasekhar and ferrari made use of the form of the scattering cross section near these resonances in their study of gravitational - wave scattering by ultra - compact stars @xcite .",
    "in geometrical units ( @xmath2 ) , the regge - wheeler potential @xmath3 describing odd - parity perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole ( bh ) of mass @xmath4 has a peak at @xmath5 .",
    "constant - density stellar models may have a radius @xmath6 ( but still larger than the buchdal limit , @xmath7 ) .",
    "when @xmath8 , the radial potential describing odd - parity perturbations of the star ( which reduces to the regge - wheeler potential for @xmath9 ) displays a local minimum as well as a maximum .",
    "if this minimum is sufficiently deep , quasi - stationary , `` trapped '' states can exist : gravitational waves can only leak out to infinity by `` tunneling '' through the potential barrier .",
    "since the damping time of these modes is very long , chandrasekhar and ferrari dubbed them `` slowly damped '' modes @xcite .    for trapped modes of ultra - compact stars the asymptotic wave amplitude at spatial infinity @xmath10 has a breit - wigner - type behavior close to the resonance : ^2+^2,[breitwigner ] where @xmath11 is the lifetime of the quasi - bound state and @xmath12 its characteristic `` energy '' .",
    "the example of ultra - compact stars shows that the search for weakly damped quasinormal modes ( qnms ) corresponding to quasi - bound states ( @xmath13 with @xmath14 ) is extremely simplified .",
    "we locate the resonances by looking for minima of @xmath15 on the @xmath16 line , and the corresponding damping time @xmath17 can then be obtained by a fit to a parabola around the minimum @xcite .    here",
    "we show that this `` resonance method '' can be used very successfully in bh spacetimes .",
    "the resonance method is particularly valuable in studies of asymptotically ads bhs .",
    "the qnm spectrum of ads bhs is related to thermalization timescales in a dual conformal field theory ( cft ) , according to the ads / cft conjecture @xcite .",
    "analytic studies of wave scattering in ads bhs have previously hinted at the existence of resonances ( see fig .  9 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; here we show that these are indeed breit - wigner resonances .",
    "various analytic calculations recently predicted the existence of long - lived modes in asymptotically ads bh spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these modes will presumably dominate the bh s response to perturbations , hence the thermalization timescale in the dual cft .",
    "since their existence may be very relevant for the ads / cft conjecture , we decided to investigate numerically these long - lived modes . in section",
    "[ small ] we confirm the existence of quasi - bound states for small sads bhs , first predicted by grain and barrau @xcite , partially correcting some of their predictions .",
    "in section [ eikonal ] we re - analyze the eikonal limit of sads qnms studied by festuccia and liu @xcite , finding excellent agreement with their calculations .",
    "it may be useful to point out that a different but intimately related method ( the complex angular momentum approach , a close kin of the theory of regge poles in quantum mechanics ) has been used in the past to study qnms in asymptotically flat bh spacetimes @xcite .",
    "some aspects of the relation between the resonance method and the theory of regge poles are illustrated , for example , in ref .",
    "in this paper we will focus on sads bhs in four spacetime dimensions , but our results are trivially extended to higher dimensions .",
    "scalar ( @xmath18 ) , electromagnetic ( @xmath19 ) and vector - type ( or regge - wheeler ) gravitational perturbations ( @xmath20 ) of sads bhs are governed by a second - order differential equation for a master variable @xmath21 @xcite : & & f^2+ff+(^2-v_l , s)=0,[waveeq ] + & & v_l , s = f[pot ] , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the ads radius , @xmath24 is related to the horizon radius @xmath25 through @xmath26 , and we assume that the perturbations depend on time as @xmath27 . as usual , we define a `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath28 by the relation @xmath29 ( so that @xmath30 as @xmath31 ) .",

    "close to the horizon , where the potential @xmath36 , we require ingoing - wave boundary conditions : ~e^-ir _ * , r _ * -  ( rr_+ ) [ bchorizon ] .near spatial infinity ( @xmath37 ) the asymptotic behavior is _",
    "s=0 ~ar^-2+br,_s=1 ,  2 ~a / r+b.[bcs ] regular scalar - field perturbations should have @xmath38 , corresponding to dirichlet boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "the case for electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations is less clear , and there are indications that robin boundary conditions may be more appropriate in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . with this caveat ,",
    "most calculations in the literature assume dirichlet boundary conditions , so we choose to work with those .",
    "in general , a solution with the correct boundary conditions at infinity behaves near the horizon ( @xmath39 ) as ~a_ine^-ir_*+a_out e^ir _ * ~r_*+r_*,[bchorizon2]with @xmath40 . for increased numerical accuracy , in our calculations",
    "we use a higher - order expansion of the form a_in(1+a(r - r_+))e^-ir_*+a_out ( 1+a^*(r - r_+ ) ) e^i r _ * , with a=. the problem is analogous to axial gravitational - wave scattering by compact stars , as long as we replace the `` outgoing - wave boundary condition at infinity '' in the stellar case by an `` ingoing - wave boundary condition at the horizon '' in the sads case ( compare our fig .",

    "the method described here provides a reliable and accurate alternative to the series solution method @xcite , to be used in regimes where the former has poor convergence properties .",
