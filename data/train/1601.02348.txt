    "decrease in the normalized intensity of the pulsar during above pulse phase range and simultaneous increase in the value of n@xmath50 confirm that the plateau like feature in xis pulse profile in 0.6 - 1.0 pulse phase range was due to the presence of additional absorbing material close to the pulsar .",
    "this can also explain the presence of an absorption dip in the xis pulse profile and an increase in the n@xmath50 value in 0.3 - 0.4 phase range of the pulsar . as in case of n@xmath50 , the covering fraction of the additional absorption",

    "these absorption features are strongly energy dependent  prominent in soft x - ray pulse profiles and gradually disappear at higher energies .",
    "complex structures or absorption dips in pulse profiles originate due to the photo - electric absorption of soft x - ray photons by matter present around the neutron star .",

    "pulse - phase resolved spectroscopy during both the observations revealed the presence of additional matter at certain phases , causing the absorption dips in the soft x - ray pulse profiles . during 2012 observation ,",
    "more number of narrow absorption dips in the pulse profiles suggest the presence of dense narrow streams of matter around the neutron star .",
    "however , during 2010 observation , relatively simpler profile with single absorption dip and a plateau phase suggests that the matter distribution around the neutron star is different and relatively simple .",

    "though , dip - like features in gx  304 - 1 ( present work ) appeared up to @xmath050  kev , the low value of additional column density at dip phases suggests that absorption is not the cause of these dips in hard x - ray pulse profiles .",

    "pulse - phase variation of covering fraction was found to be similar .",
    "we suggest that the geometry or distribution of absorbing matter around the pulsar is probably similar during both observations but at different locations .",
    "cyclotron absorption line or crsf was clearly detected in the spectra of gx  304 - 1 during both the observations and was described with pseudo - lorentzian function ( cyclabs ) in the continuum model .",
    "these are absorption like features which appear in hard x - ray spectrum ( @xmath010 - 100  kev ) through the resonant scattering of the photons with electrons in strong magnetic field ( @xmath010@xmath11  g ) near the poles of the neutron star .",

    "a negative correlation is expected in super - critical regime where the source luminosity is higher than the critical luminosity ( becker et al .",
    "2012 ; mushtukov et al .",
    "above critical luminosity , density of infalling matter becomes so high that the particles start interacting and decelerating through the formation of a radiation - pressure dominated shock above the neutron star surface .",
    "cyclotron scattering features most likely occur closer to the shock region . with increasing luminosity , the shock height drift upwards in the accretion column where relatively low strength of magnetic field produces cyclotron feature at lower energy .",

    "however , the positive correlation is predicated for a sub - critical regime e.g. below critical luminosity .",
    "the pressure of accreting matter in this regime pushes hydrodynamical shock closer to the neutron star surface where increase in the strength of magnetic field with luminosity results a positive correlation between the cyclotron line energy and luminosity ( staubert et al .",

    "( 2013 ) and nishimura ( 2014 ) have proposed alternate models to describe the dependence of cyclotron absorption line energy on the source luminosity . in these models , it is argued that the formation of cyclotron line in direct spectrum is questionable due to the large gradient of magnetic field strength along line forming region in the accretion column .",
    "however , cyclotron line ( crsf ) can be formed in the reflected radiation from the surface of the neutron star where magnetic field gradient is relatively small ( poutanen et al .",

    "larger area on neutron star surface ( from the poles with strong magnetic field towards equator with weak field strength ) is expected to be illuminated for cyclotron interactions .",

    "however , nishimura ( 2014 ) described the observed correlations by considering the changes in polar emission region , direction of photon propagation and the shock height .",
    "the negative correlation was interpreted in terms of shock region displacement whereas the positive correlation was explained by using the changes in beam pattern . in case of gx  304 - 1 ( present work ) , the cyclotron absorption line width , depth and ratio of line width and energy ( w / e@xmath63 ) show positive correlation with luminosity . the observed positive correlation between the cyclotron line energy and luminosity in gx  304 - 1 , therefore , can be explained as due to the change in beam pattern , as described by nishimura ( 2014 ) .",

    "<S> we report the timing and spectral properties of be / x - ray binary pulsar gx  304 - 1 by using two _ suzaku _ observations during its 2010 august and 2012 january x - ray outbursts . pulsations at @xmath0275  s were clearly detected in the light curves from both the observations . </S>",
    "<S> pulse profiles were found to be strongly energy - dependent . during 2010 observation , prominent dips seen in soft x - ray ( @xmath110 kev ) </S>",
    "<S> pulse profiles were found to be absent at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> however , during 2012 observation , the pulse profiles were complex due to the presence of several dips . </S>",
    "<S> significant changes in the shape of the pulse profiles were detected at high energies ( @xmath235 kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> a phase shift of @xmath00.3 was detected while comparing the phase of main dip in pulse profiles below and above @xmath035 kev . </S>",
    "<S> broad - band energy spectrum of pulsar was well described by a partially absorbed negative and positive power - law with exponential cutoff ( npex ) model with 6.4  kev iron line and a cyclotron absorption feature . </S>",
    "<S> energy of cyclotron absorption line was found to be @xmath053 and 50  kev for 2010 and 2012 observations , respectively , indicating a marginal positive dependence on source luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> based on the results obtained from phase - resolved spectroscopy , the absorption dips in the pulse profiles can be interpreted as due to the presence of additional matter at same phases . observed positive correlation between cyclotron line energy and luminosity , and significant pulse - phase variation of cyclotron parameters are discussed in the perspective of theoretical models on cyclotron absorption line in x - ray pulsars .    </S>",
