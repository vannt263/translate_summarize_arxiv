    "through a variety of observational methods we are building a census of the high - redshift universe , and can now directly study galaxies in the process of forming .",
    "color selection criteria effectively select large samples of galaxies at @xmath13 1 such as lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) @xcite , and the massive distant red galaxies ( drgs ) @xcite .",
    "selected by rest - frame optical colors to lie at @xmath14 2 , drgs exhibit properties of both passively evolved stellar populations and dusty starburst galaxies @xcite . characterizing this complex population and placing it into the context of the star formation history of the universe will elucidate our overall understanding of the assembly of massive galaxies .",
    "recent advances in the capabilities of infrared facilities have opened a new window onto the high - redshift universe . through the direct detection of dust enshrouded",
    "activity , mid- and far - infrared ( m / fir ) studies provide orthogonal information to that gathered in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical and near - infrared ( nir ) , which can be heavily biased by dust extinction .",
    "the work presented here addresses the nature of @xmath9 2 drgs through _ spitzer _ mips-24 and irac imaging .",
    "we assume a @xmath15 = 0.3 , @xmath16 = 0.7 cosmology and h@xmath17 = 70 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 throughout .",
    "the drg sample was drawn from the 10@xmath1810@xmath19 extended hubble deep field south ( ehdf - s ) of the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( musyc ) @xcite .",
    "drgs are defined by @xmath20 2.3 mag @xcite , and , in this paper , we focus on drgs with @xmath21 23.2 mag ( total magnitudes are given throughout ) , corresponding to the musyc 50% completeness limit ( quadri et al .",
    ",  in preparation ) .",
    "photometric redshifts were derived from @xmath22 photometry using the code presented in @xcite , through linear combinations of galaxy templates , with an accuracy of @xmath23 for @xmath24 . here , we have restricted our analysis to redshifts 1.5 @xmath0 2.5 where the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features of star - forming galaxies fall into the spitzer 24 filter .",
    "this provides a sample of 79 drgs with a median redshift of @xmath25 = 2.0 .",
    "the 24@xmath4 m observations were taken in the mips photometry mode and consist of 6 separate pointings .",
    "the central deepest pointing represents @xmath101 hour of frame time , and the 5 flanking pointings have 35 minutes of frame time each .",
    "the raw data were reduced and combined with the data analysis tool developed by the mips instrument team @xcite .",
    "the final image covers @xmath10104 arcmin@xmath26 .",
    "imaging at 3.0@xmath4 m , 4.5@xmath4 m , 5.8@xmath4 m and 8.0@xmath4 m was taken in the irac mapping mode and mosaicked to produce a @xmath10140 arcmin@xmath26 image .",
    "individual frames of 200 seconds were combined for a final total frame time , per location on the map , of 20 minutes .",
    "the spitzer science center provides a basic calibrated data product with flat - field corrections , dark subtraction , and linearity and flux calibrations .",
    "additional steps conducted with the irac team customized software included pointing refinement , distortion correction , and mosaicking @xcite .",
    "photometry on the 24 image was performed using the point spread function ( psf ) fitting program daophot @xcite .",
    "the psf was characterized using bright isolated point sources and then used to iteratively fit and subtract each object in the image . a small fraction ( 10/79 )",
    "drgs were highly confused with neighboring objects and these were removed from further analysis .",
    "we reached an average rms depth of @xmath1013@xmath4jy , and found the source counts to be in good agreement with @xcite . because not all the drgs are detected at 24 , their flux densities and upper limits were determined in a consistent manner by performing aperture photometry at each @xmath27-determined position after first subtracting all other objects in the catalog .",
    "we used 6 diameter apertures , and used the psf stars to apply an aperture correction factor to total flux densities at 40 .    due to the smaller beam size at the shorter irac wavelengths ( @xmath28 2 ) , and because highly confused drgs have been removed from the sample , psf fitting was not employed for the irac measurements .",
    "aperture photometry ( 3 diameter ) was performed at the location of each drg for each irac channel , again using isolated point sources to determine aperture corrections to total fluxes at 12.2@xmath29 .",
    "the average rms depths are 2.6@xmath4jy , 2.7@xmath4jy , 4.3@xmath4jy and 4.0@xmath4jy at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 , respectively .",
    "at 1.5 @xmath0 2.5 , the 24 filter samples @xmath10 6 - 10 in the rest - frame and the 24 flux offers a powerful method of differentiating between two basic sed types : active dusty galaxies , i.e. , those that are powered by either star formation or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , both of which produce substantial mid - infrared emission , and passively evolved systems whose stellar flux drops drastically longward of @xmath102 ( see fig .  [ sed ] ) . in pure starburst galaxies ,",
    "the mir emission is dominated by pah features which are strong relative to the underlying dust continuum , which only begins to rise above @xmath10 10 .",
    "the hard radiation field of an agn destroys pah carriers and the continuum emission from hot small dust grains is strong throughout the mir @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ sed ] we show the 24 flux densities for the drgs , normalized to their rest - frame l@xmath30 , and overlaid with three template seds ; 65% are detected at 24 and the remainder are shown as 3@xmath31 upper limits .",
    "this detection rate is in line with that found by @xcite for drgs the goods chandra deep field south , to a similar depth .",
    "all of the 24-detected drgs are incompatible with old stellar populations and dusty starburst or agn galaxies are required to produce such strong mid - ir emission .",
    "the sample shows a wide range in 24 flux which we interpret primarily as a range in star formation rates .",
    "however , a real difference in pah strengths , relative to the continuum , due to a range in metallicity or the hardness of the radiation field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could also be important , as could a variation in the level of agn contamination of the mir flux , though as we discuss below we deem this latter possibility unlikely .",
    "the seds of drgs which are not detected at 24 ( 35% ) are consistent with passively evolved systems , but also lower luminosity or less dusty starbursts , or starbursts which have weak or absent pah signatures as explained above . to investigate the nature of the 24-faint drgs we used a stacking analysis to measure their mean 24 emission and find @xmath32 = 10 @xmath6 2 @xmath4jy .",
    "thus , the remaining 35% of the sample can not be entirely composed of passively evolved systems but contains some fraction of dusty starburst or agn galaxies .",
    "a bootstrapping analysis indicates that this measurement is not dominated by a small number of systems , but beyond this we can not constrain the fraction of starburst or agn systems within this group .",
    "combining the 24 measurements with irac data provides a color diagnostic of agn activity ( fig .",
    "[ col ] ) @xcite .",
    "this technique relies on the different rest - frame nir sed properties of agn and starburst galaxies : stellar emission in starburst galaxies leads to a relatively flat sed in the rest - frame nir , while hot dust around an agn produces a power - law that increses toward longer wavelengths .",
    "we have detected 50% of the 24-bright drgs at 4.5 and 8 , another 20% at 4.5 , but not 8.0 , 5% in neither , and 25% fall off the irac channel 2/4 field - of - view .",
    "the colors ( fig .",
    "[ col ] ) indicate that star formation dominates the mir emission of the drgs , but as a conservative cut we consider the four objets with @xmath33 1.5 to have _",
    "possible _ agn contamination .",
    "this is in agreement with results from the x - ray @xcite and optical @xcite which also indicate that agn do not significantly contribute to the observed luminosity of drgs .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that very heavily obscured or weak agn , though energetically unimportant in terms of observed mir properties , may still be present .",
    "pah and mir emission can be used to estimate the current star formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy @xcite . using an arp220 sed template we extrapolated from 24/(1+@xmath25 )",
    "to rest - frame 6.75 .",
    "we then estimated l@xmath34 through the 6.75-f@xmath35 relation calibrated locally with the _ infrared space observatory _ , which shows a scatter of @xmath1050% @xcite .",
    "this value can then be converted to a sfr following the l@xmath36-sfr relationship of @xcite with an uncertainty of a factor @xmath10 2 - 3 .",
    "we note that adopting an m82-like sed instead of arp220 in the first step results in sfr estimates which are systematically 1.4@xmath1 lower .    in fig .",
    "[ sfrz ] we plot the 24 star formation rates or upper limits of the individual drgs with redshift .",
    "the population is not homogeneous and individual galaxies range in sfr from @xmath28 30 m@xmath7yr@xmath8 to @xmath101000 m@xmath7yr@xmath8 .",
    "a strong agn contribution to the mir flux will contaminate this estimate , by boosting the inferred sfr , and sources which may contain agn are marked .",
    "also highlighted are three drgs which are detected in the deep radio map of @xcite , two of which are possible agn based on their mir colors .",
    "studies indicate that the fraction of agn contamination in the @xmath4jy radio population increases at higher redshift @xcite , and thus , the radio detected drgs may indeed contain weak agn .",
    "however , we note that these systems fall within 1@xmath31 of the fir / radio flux correlation of @xcite ( with no systematic offset ) , which only holds for starburst galaxies , and thus significant agn contamination is unlikely .    using a stacking analysis , we calculated an average sfr for the entire drg sample of @xmath28sfr@xmath37 = 130@xmath630 m@xmath7yr@xmath8 .",
    "this is the uncertainty - weighted mean of _ all _ 69 drgs , assuming no agn contamination and a mean redshift of @xmath25 = 2 , with the uncertainty in the mean estimated from a bootstrapping analysis .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the optical sed modeling results of @xcite of 120 m@xmath7yr@xmath8 , and x - ray and submillimeter stacking analyses which estimate @xmath10100 - 200 m@xmath7yr@xmath8 and @xmath10100 m@xmath7yr@xmath8 , respectively @xcite .",
    "a significant source of error in this calculation is the photometric redshift uncertainty , since the rest - frame flux of starburst galaxies changes rapidly with wavelength in the region surrounding the pah features .",
    "this effect was quantified by recalculating sfrs for simulated redshifts within gaussian confidence intervals , and the resulting uncertainties are shown in fig .",
    "the uncertainties are substantial , ranging from a factor of two to almost an order of magnitude .",
    "we calculated the optically normalized star formation rates ( sfr / l@xmath38 ) for the drgs , which provide an indication of their age and/or dust content .",
    "we find @xmath28 sfr / l@xmath39 19yr@xmath8(l@xmath40 , which is in excellent agreement with the submillimeter study of drgs by @xcite , who measure @xmath28 sfr / l@xmath41 20 .",
    "however , the values for the drgs show large scatter , ranging from sfr / l@xmath42 5 to 200 .",
    "monte carlo simulations indicate that the redshift uncertainties can not account for the full range of this scatter and , moreover , the three radio detected galaxies have the highest sfr / l@xmath30 , for a given l@xmath30 ; as their radio flux confirms that they are extreme systems , their high sfr / l@xmath30 values are unlikely to stem solely from redshift uncertainties .",
    "using the 24 sfr estimates presented here , and the number density of drgs in the musyc fields ( known to a factor of two ; quadri et al .",
    ",  in preparation ) , we estimate a star formation rate density ( sfrd ) for the drgs of @xmath100.02 m@xmath7yr@xmath8mpc@xmath8 over the redshift range 1.5 @xmath0 2.5 , and to a depth of @xmath12 = 22.9 mag . at this depth",
    "our sample is 100% complete , and therefore requires no completeness correction .",
    "a number of uncertainties affect this estimate , including those described in the previous sections : errors in the photometric redshifts , the uncertain conversion of an observed 24 flux to a sfr , and the potential contamination from agn . also important",
    "are possible differences in dust properties and the initial mass function from low to high redshift , which are difficult to quantify .",
    "nevertheless , though the uncertainties in the individual star formation rates are high , the average star formation rate of the population is known to better accuracy since the redshift uncertainties , at least , are largely statistical .",
    "the total sfrd , integrated over all galaxies , provides a census of the star formation history of the universe , and the relative contributions of different galaxy populations is indicative of their importance in assembling stellar mass . in a general sense , there is now reasonable agreement between ir and optical sfrd estimates at @xmath9 2 .",
    "@xcite estimate a sfrd ( from x - ray measurements ) of 0.10 m@xmath7yr@xmath8mpc@xmath11 over 1.4 @xmath43 2.6 , for optical and nir selected galaxies , with drgs producing 20% of this total . likewise ,",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath10 0.1 m@xmath7yr@xmath8mpc@xmath11 for submm - selected systems , after extending the submm luminosity function down to @xmath44 = 1 mjy , and applying a correction for agn contamination .",
    "thus , the two techniques converge on a similar value , and assuming the @xmath45 1 mjy population encompasses the bulk of the optical and nir selected galaxies , and vice versa , this can be taken as a total sfrd at @xmath9 2 ( but see both papers for a discussion of uncertainties and assumptions ) .",
    "our completeness limit of @xmath12 = 22.9 mag is roughly equal to the @xcite drg depth over a similar redshift range , and we find the same sfrd for drgs of @xmath10 0.02 m@xmath7yr@xmath8mpc@xmath11 ; thus , the x - ray and mir determined sfrd measurements agree that the drgs produce roughly 20% of the total sfrd of optical and nir selected star forming galaxies .",
    "a consistent picture is seen at longer wavelengths . if we use the 24 flux density of each drg to predict its approximate 850 flux density , we find that our sfrd estimate is dominated by objects with @xmath46 1mjy , and thus again drgs produce @xmath10 20% of the total sfrd as measured at submm wavelengths . in conclusion , drgs , to a depth of @xmath12 = 22.9 mag are important contributors to the total sfrd at @xmath9 2 , and by extension , to the assembly of massive galaxies .",
    "the analysis presented here indicate that drgs constitute a heterogeneous population , with the majority consisting of luminous and dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "we find that @xmath3765% of the e - hdfs sample are such systems and this is in good agreement with similar spitzer studies @xcite , and rest - frame optical sed modeling @xcite .",
    "using the 24 flux we estimate an average sfr for the population ( to @xmath12 = 23.2 ) of 130@xmath630 m@xmath7yr@xmath8 , in line with earlier estimates from optical , submm and x - ray studies . normalizing the sfr to the rest - frame l@xmath30 yields sfr / l@xmath47 19 m@xmath7yr@xmath8(l@xmath48 , but with substantial scatter around this value .",
    "the scatter can not be explained solely by redshift uncertainties , and indicates a real difference in the individual properties drgs .",
    "overall , drgs are important contributors to the sfrd at @xmath9 2 at a level of 0.02 m@xmath7yr@xmath8mpc@xmath11 to our 100% completeness limit of @xmath12 = 22.9 .    research by tw is supported by a veni research fellowship , through the nederlanse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek .",
