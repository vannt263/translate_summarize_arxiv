    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions at the lhc offer interesting potential for the studies of the higgs boson , quartic gauge couplings and the top quark as well as for searches of new physics @xcite .",
    "in particular , the clean and striking experimental signatures of the exclusive processes @xmath2 ( forward regions devoid of any hadronic activity apart from presence of two forward scattered protons ) are well suited for the search of new charged massive particles beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "the two - photon pair production mechanism is simple and often results in simple final states ( as shown in figure[fig : prod - decay ] ) , in contrast to many other cases at the lhc with usual complex    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     a narrow peak centered on @xmath3 236  gev = 2@xmath4118  gev demonstrates possibility of an event - by - event determination of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mass with few gev resolution .",
    "to be sensitive to the fb - level cross - sections , such studies have to be performed at the nominal lhc luminosity .",
    "the large event rates lead then to large backgrounds due to accidental coincidences of dileptonic events in the central detector and two forward protons detected in the vfds , but not coming from the same vertex @xcite .",
    "the effect of multiple interactions per beam collision was simulated by superimposing over dileptonic inclusive events , @xmath7 and @xmath8 production . ]",
    "@xmath9 overlap events on average for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 , and by distributing the extra vertices according to a @xmath13 mm wide gaussian @xcite .",
    "the probability to detect two diffractive accidental protons per beam collision ( one on each side of the interaction point ) is expected to be on average @xmath14 at low and @xmath15 at high luminosity .",
    "the associated background cross - sections reach @xmath16  fb and @xmath17  fb respectively .",
    "+ this background can be reduced using the tracks associated to the dilepton vertex , which are not present in the exclusive events .",
    "one can therefore request no extra track with @xmath18  gev ( where @xmath19 reconstruction efficiency is assumed ) associated to the @xmath20 vertex .",
    "it provides a background reduction of @xmath21 .",
    "further background reduction can be made using precise time - of - flight proton detectors with a few pico - second resolution , and by reconstruction of the event vertex position from the proton timing @xcite .",
