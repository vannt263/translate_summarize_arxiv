    "combinations of mildly nonlinear wave motion in molecular structures with localized excitation modes can lead to localization of wave energy . perhaps the early mathematical example was davydov s soliton theory modeling _",
    "exciton waves _ in protein molecules interacting with localized _ phonons _ , vibrations at co bonds , where a continuum limit gave the integrable one dimensional focusing cubic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation @xcite .",
    "this was further developed by various authors including scott @xcite , and extended to vibrations in other molecular systems such as crystalline acetanilide and in smaller molecules such as benzene @xcite .",
    "approximations that eliminate the fastest internal vibration modes again lead to systems that are discrete counterparts of the 1d focusing cubic nls , or coupled systems of such .    two dimensional molecular structures such as scheibe aggregates @xcite lead to similar mathematical models related to the 2d focusing cubic nls @xcite .",
    "stochastic terms are a natural refinement , modeling effects such as random spatial variations in the medium ( _ fixed pattern noise _ : time independent ) or thermal agitation ( _ white noise _ : temporally uncorrelated ) @xcite .",
    "nonlinear optics has also produced continuum or semi - discrete examples including intense cw lasers and multi - cored optical fibers with random imperfections in the medium or in the strength of the coupling between signals in the different cores or different propagation modes .",
    "however , noise without balancing losses can lead to an unphysical degree of spatial disorder or _ thermal runaway _ , impeding wave propagation in contradiction to experimental observations @xcite .",
    "even worse , the obvious continuum limits give stochastic nls ( snls ) equations which seem to be well - posed only when the noise has adequate spatial correlation @xcite , which is not necessarily consistent with the length scales in the molecular systems .",
    "in other words , noise can destroy the spatial smoothness needed to justify a continuum limit .",
    "more realistic modeling thus requires damping losses , to make possible attainment of thermal equilibrium , solutions with enough spatial smoothness to sustain traveling waves , and perhaps to justify a continuum limit model .",
    "this leads @xcite to the damped stochastic discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dsdnls ) @xmath0 with @xmath1 giving the cubic case typical in physical applications .",
    "this is the main object of this study , but possible continuum limits will also be discussed briefly .",
    "the most obvious is the damped stochastic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dsnls ) @xmath2 derived and studied in @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are noise processes with @xmath5 labeling realizations , and the physical meanings of the variables and parameters will be explained in the next section .",
    "the next section surveys the background for this study : physical origins , mathematical modeling , and previous results , some theoretical , but mostly numerical simulations .",
    "section  [ sect : numerical - methods ] decribes the numerical methods used , and section  [ sect : numerical results ] presents numerical results , primarily for the surrogate case of a one dimensional structure with quintic nonlinearity @xmath6 . then continuum limits are discussed in section  [ sect : continuum ] , with some suggestions as to how to overcome problems with previous approaches , followed by conclusions and a discussion of directions for further work .",
    "we give here some details of a two dimensional example from chemistry and biochemistry : modeling _ scheibe aggregates _ , a class of highly ordered thin films of molecules coupled by dipole interactions predominantly within a plane : an essentially two dimensional wave medium . however much of the modeling is also relevant to a variety of other molecular systems such as the essentially one dimensional protein models discussed above ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "scheibe aggregates are highly regular arrangements of molecules in thin films , sometimes a single molecule thick , or with only weak interaction between neighboring layers of molecules .",
    "these structures have important biological roles such as in photo - chemical reactions , and one laboratory example is the cyanine dye scheibe aggregates first studied by bcher , kuhn , mbius et al @xcite .",
    "they establish an arrangement of the molecules in a single layer `` brick - wall '' lattice , with the dominant dipole interactions being those with six nearest neighboring molecules , arranged in a hexagonal array of approximately dihedral @xmath7 symmetry ( half turns and reflection in two perpendicular axes ) .",
    "the molecules also have internal excitation states , which are coupled to the excitons and are also subject to thermal effects : random external forces due to collisions with molecules from outside the thin film .",
    "such thin films can be modeled as an exciton - phonon system with noise and damping acting on the internal modes as described by bang , christiansen , if , rasmussen and gaididei in @xcite , which adds damping to the purely quantum mechanical modeling of bartnick and tuszyski @xcite : @xmath8 where + @xmath9 is the exciton wave at location @xmath10 , + @xmath11 is the elastic degree of freedom of the molecule at location @xmath10 , + @xmath12 is the dipole - dipole interaction energy , + @xmath13 is the exciton - phonon coupling constant , + @xmath14 is random external forces , the formal time derivative of an independent wiener process ( brownian motion ) at each node , + @xmath15 is the strength of the random external forces , + @xmath16 is the damping coefficient , + @xmath17 is the molecular mass , and + @xmath18 is the einstein frequency of each oscillator .",
    "these equations conserves the energy @xmath19 under the stratonovic interpretation of the stochastic term as discussed below , at least on a fully infinite lattice or with suitable boundary conditions such as periodic .",
    "the form of eq s  , also covers a wide range of other applications such as the one dimensional protein molecule models mentioned above : the indices will often be taken below to simply enumerate a collection of _ nodes _ , with details such as spatial relationships between locations encoded in the coupling terms @xmath12 . for further mathematical flexibility",
    ", the coupling term will henceforth be written as a general power law @xmath20 , though all physical models we know of have the cubic nonlinearity @xmath1 .",
    "the underlying spatial dimension will be denoted by @xmath21 , so @xmath22 in the model above .    without noise and damping ,",
    "the system in , is hamiltonian , giving a second conserved quantity @xmath23      the phonon terms @xmath24 can be eliminated using the variation of parameters formula which gives an integral expression for @xmath24 in terms of @xmath25 @xcite . to eliminate the resulting time integral and initial data transients",

    "if the coupling @xmath12 is homogeneous , in that the quantities @xmath31 have a common value @xmath32 , then the @xmath25 have a common average phase evolution @xmath33 .",
    "this can be removed by adding @xmath34 to each coupling sum , and with some rescalings including @xmath35 , @xmath36 , one gets the damped stochastic discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation eq .  .",
    "even if the @xmath34 are not all equal , one can use their average value @xmath37 as the phase shift , and absorb the differences @xmath38 into the noise coefficients as fixed pattern noise .",
    "the energy @xmath19 is still conserved , and without noise or damping the system still has a conserved hamiltonian , @xmath39    simple examples are uniform nearest neighbor interaction on a line [ 1d ] or square lattice [ 2d ] of spacing @xmath40 with all the non - zero @xmath12 having the same value , @xmath41 .",
    "the coupling term is then a @xmath42 times the standard three point second derivative [ 1d ] or five point discrete laplacian [ 2d ] , and the equation is a discretization of the damped stochastic nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "also , the hamiltonian for the case of no noise or damping is the natural discretization using simple forward difference quotients for the gradient terms of the hamiltonian for nls , @xmath43    it can be useful in places to think of the ode systems in relation to the familiar nls equation , but a more careful consideration of continuum limit approximations is needed , as discussed in section [ sect : continuum ] .      for some purposes ,",
    "the time derivative should be eliminated from the damping term .",
    "also , the rigorous mathematical formulation must be in terms of stochastic integrals and differentials , and in order to conserve the energy @xmath44 , products involving stochastic terms must be interpreted in the stratonovic sense .",

    "the new term adds rapid exponential decay , destroying the manifestly conservative form .",
    "this reflects the fact that the it differential term itself generates rapid exponential growth of individual realizations , related to the fact that the ensemble average of it solutions satisfy the underlying noise - free equation , and so conserves the energy @xmath44 .",
    "this prevents the use of time discretizations which inherently conserve energy @xmath44 ; such conservative discretizations are used here for the stratonovic form .",
    "also , the it form has no continuum limit with spatially uncorrelated noise .",
    "this might reflect the conjectured lack of existence of solutions to such continuum limits , even when the limit formally exists for the stratonovic form .",
    "in the continuum model of 2d nls , self - focusing can lead to the formation of single point singularities , sometimes called _",
    "wave collapse_. the proof of this for the nls is based on a variance argument , which has been extended to various cases of stochastic nls by gaididei and christiansen @xcite , debussche and di menza @xcite , and fannjiang @xcite , though all require noise that is sufficiently correlated in space and uncorrelated in time .",
    "the last mentioned author s results are as follows .    for data of sufficiently rapid decay at infinity",
    ", the pulse width can be measured by its spatial variance @xmath49 in the critical case of 2d cubic ( and more generally , @xmath50 ) , the ensemble average @xmath51 is related to the ensemble average @xmath52 of the hamiltonian by @xmath53 and in turn noise modifies conservation of the hamiltonian to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the power spectral density of the noise distribution .    for spatially uncorrelated noise",
    ", @xmath55 is a positive constant , so @xmath56 : the formulas break down , but strongly suggest that snls has no solutions , at least in sobolev space @xmath57 . for",
    "comparison to the discrete equations , for which no analogues of these formulas are known , note that a discretization of snls with grid spacing @xmath40 effectively has noise of correlation length scale @xmath40 , and such correlation in snls gives @xmath58    without noise , @xmath59 , @xmath60 evolves quadratically , and @xmath61 is sufficient condition for finite time singularity formation , as otherwise , @xmath62 would become negative .",
    "noise changes the evolution to the cubic @xmath63 clearly , with weak enough noise , @xmath64 still leads to a prediction of negative @xmath51 by some positive time @xmath65 , so with positive probability , solutions must cease to exist before that time .",
    "however , sufficiently large noise eliminates this necessity , and hints at global existence , and at dispersion with a cubic rate of variance growth .",
    "such formulas have not yet been extended to account for damping , but as seen below , there are hints of an additional negative term in @xmath66 .      with no noise or damping , numerical simulations of discrete counterparts of the nls equation show phenomena analogous to wave collapse , even in the subcritical case of 1d cubic , where the pde has some degree of self - focusing , but can not develop singularities .",
    "that is , solutions can have the energy concentrate until it is mostly at a single node ( molecule ) , and then stay localized in a solution that seems to oscillate around a stable steady state .",
    "this was first described by davydov  @xcite in models of protein molecules , and further analyzed and simulated by eilbeck , lomdahl and scott  @xcite , who describe the phenomenon as _ self - trapping_. for the discrete systems with noise , no formulas are known for the evolution of ensemble averages considered above , but from eq .   and",

    "this is to be expected , since those discrete systems are effectively discretizations of snls with noise of spatial correlation on length scale comparable to the mesh spacing of the discretization .",
    "the full 2d stochastic nls equation with spatially uncorrelated noise has been simulated by bang , christiansen , if , rasmussen and gaididei in@xcite , and the 1d quintic case of the stochastic nls equation by debussche and di menza in @xcite . in each case",
    "it is observed that spatially uncorrelated noise above a certain threshold level prevents wave collapse .",
    "the former paper indicates that this noise effect is too strong to match physical experiments : noise levels so low as to correspond to temperatures of a few kelvin are needed to reproduce behavior seen in experiments at far higher temperatures .",
    "the likely cause is `` thermal runaway '' due to the absence of a mechanism for `` heat loss '' , such as the damping term .",
    "the latter authors also interpret simulations as showing that with spatially correlated noise ( as is effectively imposed by a fixed spatial discretization ) , collapse can only be delayed , but will always occur .",
    "they also offer a non - rigorous argument for this second conclusion .",
    "however we come to a different conclusion below . in @xcite",
    ", the authors judge that collapse has occurred whenever the maximum amplitude has grown by a factor of three at any one time , but this seems unreliable when noise is present , since then amplitude spikes this high at a single node can occur transiently , rather than as part of ongoing focusing events .",
    "a more reliable criterion for numerical detection of wave collapse and energy localization is that the energy at a single node exceeds some substantial fraction of all energy , persistently for a significant interval of time . in the simulations below",
    ", localization is manifested with a majority of all energy staying at one node until the end of the computer time , and thus persisting for at least as long as the rise time of the localization .    as to damping effects , eq .",
    "indicates that damping has the opposite effect of noise , causing reduction of @xmath68 . combined with the expectation that still holds approximately for discretizations of snls",
    ", this suggests the possible return of wave collapse , in the discrete form of concentration of energy near a single node .",
    "christiansen et al @xcite have done the only simulations known to the current authors of the model with damping of eq .  .",
    "they do this with further approximate by a small system of ode s , first imposing radially symmetry and then using the method of _ collective coordinates_. such modeling has lead to some analytical results on self - focusing in the nls equation , but with the stochastic terms , it still requires study primarily by simulation .",
    "they start with simulations without damping , corroborating the above described observations about inhibition of wave collapse by sufficiently strong noise , leading instead to dispersion of initially concentrated wave energy .",
    "with damping added , they observe that the effect of noise can be reversed , leading to collapse where with noise alone it would not occur , as suggested by eq .  .",
    "again there appears to be a threshold damping level for this to occur with given initial data and noise level .",
    "[ todo1 ]    with this survey done , we are ready to consider new numerical methods and results of simulations based on eq .  .",
    "with noise but no damping , and with homogeneous coupling and periodic boundary conditions , a fourier split - step method could be used , as was done by bang et al @xcite for snls .    instead , an implicit time discretization based on fixed point iterative solution of the trapezoid rule is used , similar to one described and analyzed by chang and xu  @xcite .",
    "it has several virtues :    * it satisfies the needed stratonovic interpretation ( no need for the it correction term ) , * it conserves the exciton energy @xmath44 , and * with no noise or damping , it conserves the hamiltonian @xmath68 .",
    "the main disadvantage is the need for iterative solution ( so that conservation is no longer exact , but still highly accurate ) , and the fact that it is difficult to go beyond simple fixed point iteration due to the existence of coupled nonlinear terms , leading to the time step size restrictions typical of an explicit method rather than the underlying implicit method and a large number of iterations needed when noise effects are strong . since the coupling is strong relative to the other terms ( as in the discretized nls equations that these essentially are ) the system is rather stiff , leading to the need for rather small time steps .    however , arguably the short spatial scales of the noise mean that the time step size limitations of simple iterative solution method are also the natural time scales of the smallest relevant features , so there might be little room for time step increases without inaccurate handling of noise effects .    that is , the stiffness of the ode systems is probably an essential time scale that must be preserved in the modeling , including the fully discrete model used for numerical solution .",
    "writing @xmath69 for the approximations of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for the approximation of @xmath73 , constant on @xmath74 , the scheme used for the cubic case is @xmath75 \\times \\frac{\\psi_n^j + \\psi_n^{j+1}}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the case studied so far of totally uncorrelated noise , the noise components @xmath76 are independent with normal distribution @xmath77 so that @xmath78 .",
    "the scaling with @xmath40 and nearest coupling strength @xmath79 are used for consistency with interpretation as the discretization of the dsnls , eq .  .",
    "more generally , exact conservation of the hamiltonian is achieved by discretizing the nonlinear term @xmath80 as @xmath81 thus for quintic nonlinearity , the form for this term is not the familiar trapezoid approximation , but @xmath82      the nonlinear implicit scheme above is solved using a simple fixed point iteration , eliminating implicit form even for the linear dipole coupling ( discrete laplacian ) terms , and thus avoiding simultaneous linear equation solving , contrary to the original chang - xu algorithm .",
    "the reason is the nonlinearity and stiffness of the damping term and the formally unbounded noise terms , which lead in practice to similar `` explicit scheme '' time step size restriction @xmath83 even with implicit handling of the linear coupling term .",
    "writing @xmath84 for the @xmath85-th iterate , the initial approximation used for the new time step is @xmath86 , and and subsequent iterates are given by solving the uncoupled linear equations @xmath87 \\times \\frac{\\psi_n^j + \\psi_n^{j+1,k+1}}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the fixed point scheme has a worst case convergence rate of @xmath88 with @xmath89 , so @xmath90 for the three point discrete second derivative used in the 1d quintic case , giving a convergence condition @xmath91 .",
    "to minimize computational cost in the sense of minimizing expected iterations per unit time , the optimal choice of @xmath92 balances @xmath93 time steps per unit time and the @xmath94 iterations per time step needed to meet a given error tolerance @xmath95 .",
    "minimization of @xmath96 gives @xmath97 , which is in fact observed to be optimal with spatially uncorrelated noise and no damping , a case where it will be seen below that `` thermal runaway '' puts significant amount of signal in the shortest length scales , realizing the worst case convergence rate . on the other hand , without noise or with damping ,",
    "solutions are smoother and larger values @xmath98 are most efficient , with @xmath99 always necessary for convergence .",
    "for computational efficiency , simulations have been done with a single computational space dimension , using two different approaches to this reduction of dimension .",
    "the main studies are done for the one dimensional quintic case @xmath100 , @xmath6 , with this somewhat unnatural nonlinearity power used for the sake of remaining in the critical case for collapse in nls .",
    "homogeneous nearest neighbor coupling is used , corresponding to discretizing nls with the the standard three point discretization of the second derivative .",
    "nearest neighbor coupling makes sense in the physical models , since dipole interactions are very short range .",
    "it also makes little sense to use higher order spatial discretizations of stochastic nls equations , because the noise eliminates the higher order smoothness needed to make such discretizations more accurate .",
    "this case , without damping , was also studied by debussche and di menza @xcite , as discussed in section  [ subsect : background - localization - discrete ] above .",
    "the second reduction used is imposing radial symmetry on the two dimension cubic nls ( @xmath22 , @xmath1 ) , and then again using standard three point discretization of spatial derivatives .",
    "this allows comparison to the results of bang , christiansen et al @xcite also discussed above .",

    "is illustrated in fig s  [ fig : dsdst1dq_etx_all ] and [ fig : dsdst1dq_etx ] , which show the distribution of energy @xmath27 amongst nodes , for various times @xmath110 .",
    "the first figure shows all 100 nodes , at three times before self - trapping occurs at @xmath111 and two times afterwards .",
