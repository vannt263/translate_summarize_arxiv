    "the discovery of a scalar boson at the lhc experiments atlas @xcite and cms @xcite with properties remarkably close to the one proposed as agent of electroweak symmetry breaking in 1964 @xcite has explained the origin of elementary particle masses ( with maybe neutrinos aside ) within the standard model ( sm ) . despite the extraordinary success of this theory",
    ", there remain some unanswered questions within the sm , such as the origin of dark matter or the explanation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "these and other puzzles motivate the scrutiny of the sm predictions against measurements in the search for new physics . + one way to do this is to take advantage of observables where both sharp predictions and accurate measurements are possible , in such a way that tiny deviations between them can become statistically significant and hint at the new dynamics .",
    "an alternative is to search for forbidden processes in the sm , where an observation must be due to new phenomena .",
    "lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes are practically forbidden in the minimal extension of the sm with right - handed neutrinos , where the large suppression given by the ratio between the neutrino masses and electroweak scale makes them undetectable @xcite .",
    "+ although currently well compatible with the sm , the uncertainties associated to higgs physics still leave room for sizable non - standard decays , such as invisible modes @xcite or lfv decays . in the latter case , which we consider in this letter , direct searches for @xmath0 decays",
    "have been performed by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "the cms result @xcite , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 at @xmath10 cl ) caused a big excitement in the community , although atlas @xcite did not confirm it a few months later , setting the bound @xmath11 at the same confidence level .",
    "implies @xmath12 . ] , which lowers the combined significance of the hint at the two sigma level .",
    "] + the possibility that this branching fraction could be measurable was put forward much early in diverse sm extensions @xcite , typically including several scalar doublets @xcite , and reanalyzed including the limits on @xmath13 decays and other low - energy processes in forthcoming years @xcite .",
    "the cms hint was the object of several devoted studies which could find regions of their parameter space explaining the anomaly @xcite .",
    "however , some other analyses either found difficult to produce such a strong signal in well - motivated extensions of the sm or pinpointed tensions with other precision measurements @xcite .",
    "+ it is well known that the hierarchy problem in the higgs mass arises whenever heavy new particles are introduced without a mechanism devised to cancel or effectively suppress the corresponding radiative corrections .",
    "one such mechanism assumes that the higgs boson is a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken ( larger than in the sm ) electroweak symmetry group , in the so - called little higgs models @xcite .",
    "simplest little higgs ( slh ) model @xcite is a concrete realization of this idea that we employed in our study of lfv semileptonic tau decays recently @xcite .",
    "our main conclusion was that the observation of lfv semileptonic tau decays at belle - ii @xcite would ( using reasonable approximations ) rule out this model , as it predicts decay rates four to five orders of magnitude smaller than current bounds . according to lhc results , @xmath3 decays",
    "are allowed at a rate of about @xmath14 .",
    "however , the severe limits on @xmath2 constrain @xmath15 @xcite and a strong suppression on @xmath16 is also expected from the @xmath17 bounds @xcite . since the slh model does not violate lepton universality ( lu ) , confirmation of the cms hint in @xmath18 decays would therefore falsify the ( s)lh models . on the contrary , if no lfv higgs decays are confirmed at the lhc and recent lu breaking hints are refuted , these models with collective electroweak symmetry breaking will remain to be a promising alternative for the ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of the sm . our aim in this paper is to make the above considerations precise , keeping in mind that current lhc analyses using lh models @xcite do not show noticeable deviations .",
    "+ in the next section we outline the main features of the slh model , referring to our earlier work @xcite for an extended discussion . in section [ results ]",
    "we compute the leading contributions to the @xmath3 decays within this model explaining our expansion in powers of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath19 ) over that of the new particles of the extended model ( @xmath20 ) . we also confront the predictions of the slh model for the considered decays to the current bounds , employing a parameter space of the slh model which is consistent with current data and in section [ conclusions ] we state our conclusions .",
    "we reviewed in some detail the slh model in our previous work @xcite . here",
    "we will only recall its main features for the reader s convenience , but refer to @xcite and references therein for an expanded account .",
    "+ the slh model extends the sm electroweak gauge group @xmath21 to @xmath22 in a minimal way .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath23 sm fermion doublets are enlarged to @xmath24 triplets and five extra weak gauge bosons are added ( three neutral and two of opposite unit charges which , after diagonalization , give rise to heavy copies of the @xmath25 bosons that we call @xmath26 ) . @xmath27",
    "invariant interactions are written so as to reproduce all the sm dynamics when restricted to the sm fields . among the new particles ,",
    "only the heavy quasi - dirac neutrinos @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the family index ) , which allow the lfv transitions , and the @xmath26 bosons play a role in our study . within the slh model , lfv is achieved because of the misalignment between the sm down - type lepton and the new heavy neutrino mass matrices .",
    "+ the starting global symmetry of the model , @xmath30_1\\otimes\\left[su(3)\\otimes u(1)\\right]_2 $ ] , is spontaneously broken down to @xmath31_1\\otimes \\left[su(2)\\otimes u(1)\\right]_2 $ ] by the non - vanishing aligned vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) acquired by the two scalar triplets of the model ( the scalar sector is a non - linear sigma model ) .",
    "these transform as @xmath32 and @xmath33 under @xmath34 , respectively , and include the sm higgs doublets as well as new pseudo - goldstone bosons ( pgbs ) . both vevs , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are of order tev and determine the high - energy scale of the model , @xmath20 , through @xmath37 .",
    "the gauged diagonal subgroup , @xmath22 , breaks down to the @xmath38 electroweak gauge group via these scalar vacuum condensates .",
    "the gauge interactions of the model are fixed by gauge invariance and given in terms of the sm couplings .",
    "+ the spontaneous symmetry breaking produces 5 pgbs for each scalar .",
    "since one @xmath27 is weakly gauged , 5 pgbs give -through the higgs mechanism- masses of @xmath39 to the new gauge bosons , while the 5 orthogonal combinations are pgbs ( including the higgs boson and , particularly , alleviating the hierarchy problem on its mass , @xmath40 , due to the structure of the slh model ) .",
    "since the mass of the new gauge bosons is proportional to the high scale , @xmath20 : @xmath41 , this suppresses their contribution at low energies .",
    "light and the new heavy neutrinos do mix as regulated by the small parameter @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the ratio between both vevs , and heavy neutrino masses are also set by the large scale @xmath20 . in our computation",
    "we will exploit the fact that the ratio @xmath44 is small ( @xmath45 @xcite ) to expand our amplitudes in it and keep only the leading contribution .",
    "lfv higgs decays arise at one - loop level in the slh model and are possible because the  little  heavy neutrinos @xmath28 couple to either charged lepton , @xmath46 , irrespective of its flavor . in the considered",
    "@xmath3 decays only the topologies sketched in fig .",
    "[ feynmandiagrams ] contribute at this order .",
    "since the higgs boson couples not only to a pair of @xmath47 but also to @xmath48 , the first topology gives rise to four different diagrams . in the diagrams built with",
    "the @xmath49 vertex yields two different results , as can easily be shown . ] in the second topology , the loop mediating the lfv transition may as well be placed in the @xmath50 leg , and in the last one the exchange @xmath51 yields an inequivalent contribution . in all",
    ", this makes 12 different diagrams at this order working in the unitary gauge , where only physical degrees of freedom appear and the number of diagrams is reduced .",
    "although each diagram diverges stronger in this gauge than in that of t hooft - feynman , the individual divergences cancel , as they must , to ensure a finite result .",
    "+ the contributions of self - energy type ( second diagram ) are proportional to @xmath52 and will thus be neglected for @xmath53 . along the computation",
    "we have neglected powers of the ratios of lepton masses over gauge boson ( @xmath54 ) and heavy neutrino ( @xmath55 ) masses .",
    "for definiteness we include our results for the @xmath56 decay .",
    "there is an overall dependence on the heaviest final - state lepton mass , which shows that the decay rate @xmath3 vanishes in the limit of massless decay products .",
    "therefore , and in absence of a mechanism of lu violation in the slh model , we will have @xmath57 , which suppresses the latter decay rate by a factor @xmath58 .",
    "given this trivial proportionality , we will only be plotting @xmath59 in figs .",
    "[ plot1]-[plot4 ] .",
    "+ within this setting , there are two different mass scales in the problem : those of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) and those of @xmath39 ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we used @xmath65 to characterize the ratio between two separated scales and @xmath66 for that of two high scales .",
    "since there were only three mass scales in the study of semileptonic lfv tau decays within this model , all mass ratios could be expressed in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( unless there is a very strong hierarchy between the different heavy neutrino flavors ) . in the present study",
    ", there is @xmath62 , as well .",
    "this entails the appearance of four small ratios between a light and a heavy particle mass : @xmath69 ( we recall that @xmath70 as well ) and two involving particles with similar masses : @xmath71 .",
    "+        feynman diagrams for @xmath72 decays in the slh model .",
    "our analytical expressions are simplified in the limit of only two heavy neutrinos that we follow @xcite .",
    "we will however , consider also the case with three heavy neutrinos for completeness after eq .",
    "( [ br ] ) .",
    "let us discuss our choices for defining the parameter space of the model before presenting our expressions",
    ". in the numerical analysis we have stick to the choices argued in our previous work @xcite , in such a way that a considerable portion of the points generated randomly in the ranges fixed _ a priori _ fulfils the constraints coming from @xmath2 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 conversion in nuclei @xcite and also those on @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we recall in the following the _ a priori _ range of variation that we are allowing for the independent model parameters in our parameter space scan :    * we have varied the scale of compositeness between 2 and 10 tevs .",
    "lower values are in tension with electroweak precision observables and larger figures enter the region where a uv completion of the slh model ( that would become strongly coupled ) starts to be expected @xcite . *",
    "the lfv processes are possible in the slh model because of the presence of the heavy neutrinos .",
    "the dependence of the amplitude on their contribution is @xmath75 assuming two families and one mixing angle , this can be written @xmath76 \\ , .\\ ] ] this simplification will be used to write eq.([br ] ) below .",
    "particularly , since the terms with @xmath77 are independent on @xmath68 , they do not contribute in this limit ( see , however , eq .",
    "( [ replacement3ns ] ) ) .",
    "this , by the way , prevents the appearance of a moderately large log , @xmath78 , in the two heavy neutrino scenario . in the numerics",
    ", we will use the limits @xmath79 and @xmath80 and @xmath81 , consistent with current data  @xcite . * finally , the ratio of the two vevs in the model , @xmath82 , is also a free parameter of the slh model .",
    "we will take the range @xmath83 for it , consistent with the known limits for the mixing between a little and a light neutrino encoded in @xmath84 , which should be @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "in these lfv higgs decays there is at least a lepton which can be considered massless and , thus , with fixed helicity .",
    "then , the matrix element for the @xmath56 decays can be written as    @xmath86\\bar{u}(p ' ) p_r u(q , m_\\tau)\\,,\\ ] ]     + where :    @xmath87     + and    @xmath88\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in our computation we kept terms of subleading order ( @xmath89 ) and check for accidental numerical enhancements of these before neglecting them . after checking its irrelevance , we omitted one such a term in @xmath90 and another one in @xmath91 .",
    "the corresponding branching ratio is    @xmath92 ^ 2\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + we have performed a scan of the parameter space limited by the above _ a priori _ restrictions verifying that the constraints from low - energy processes are respected and plotted @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) as a function of one parameter in turn ( @xmath20 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) in the left pannel of figs .",
    "[ plot1]-[plot4 ] .",
    "roughly @xmath98 of the @xmath99 randomly generated points satisfied the low - energy restrictions .",
    "since these branching fractions are very suppressed , we have considered next the case with three heavy neutrinos , @xmath28 , expecting that the increase of degrees of freedom allows to satisfy the low - energy contraints on lfv processes and , at the same time , yield @xmath100 with larger decay rates . in this general case",
    "we have considered the pdg @xcite parametrization for the mixing between charged leptons and heavy neutrinos assuming only a vanishing cp violating phase for simplicity .",
    "therefore    @xmath101    where we have employed the usual notation @xmath102 cos@xmath103 , @xmath104 sin@xmath103 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in this case",
    "the replacement needed in eq .",
    "( [ br ] ) is @xmath107 ^ 2 \\to \\sum_{i=1}^3 v_\\ell^{i\\mu}v_\\ell^{i\\tau}\\left[o\\log\\left(\\frac{\\chi_i}{\\omega }   \\right)+p(\\chi_i)\\right]^2\\,,\\ ] ] where the assumed cp conservation of @xmath108 was used .",
    "we have verified that restricting the maximum values of @xmath109 to reasonable upper limits does not yield additional constraints than requiring the fulfilment of the experimental bounds on low - energy lfv processes .",
    "consequently , we have scanned over @xmath110 ensuring the low - energy restrictions .",
    "constraints in the case with three heavy neutrinos are milder than in the previous case where two heavy neutral leptons were considered @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of that to slightly modify our choices of their parameters aiming to increase the predicted @xmath100 branching ratios .",
    "for the masses of the three heavy neutrinos we have followed the educated guess @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( we recall that @xmath114 depends quadratically on the @xmath115 mass ) , while @xmath20 and tan@xmath116 have been varied in the same way as in the two heavy neutrino scenario . in this way we have obtained the plots depicted on the right pannels of figures [ plot1]-[plot4 ] .",
    "the comparison of the left and right plots of these figures shows that , indeed , allowing for an extra heavy neutrino gives us enough freedom to increase the predicted decay rates by some four orders of magnitude .",
    "however , these still remain well below the cms hint on @xmath0 and the detectability level at lhc .",
    "@xmath117{hscatt1.eps } & \\includegraphics[scale=0.33 , angle=-90]{hscatt1_3.eps }   \\end{array}$ ]    @xmath117{hscatt4.eps } & \\includegraphics[scale=0.33 , angle=-90]{hscatt4_3.eps }   \\end{array}$ ]    @xmath117{hscatt2.eps } & \\includegraphics[scale=0.33 , angle=-90]{hscatt2_3.eps }   \\end{array}$ ]    @xmath117{hscatt3.eps } & \\includegraphics[scale=0.33 , angle=-90]{hscatt3_3.eps }   \\end{array}$ ]    the general trend is that the slh model produces @xmath118 decay widths which are at least six orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath119 hinted by cms ( see also figure [ plot5 ] ) .",
    "a similarly strong suppression of @xmath93 is also found in a recent analysis within the little higgs model with t - parity including constraints from other charged lepton flavor violating processes  @xcite .",
    "finally , in figure [ plot5 ] we show that there is basically no correlation between @xmath93 and @xmath120 ( the most restrictive low - energy search ) in the case with three heavy neutrinos .",
    "there are not sizable correlations between the pairs @xmath93 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , @xmath120 either .",
    "as expected , if the slh model is to satisfy the bounds on @xmath1 set by @xmath2 ( @xmath15 @xcite ) -as it does- , it must fall way too short to explain the cms hint , as a consequence of its lu .",
    "it must be pointed out , however , that we restricted the yukawa interactions in the lepton sector up to operators of dimension 5 .",
    "given our ignorance of the flavor structure of the theory at its cut - off , it could be possible that the contribution of higher - dimensional operators ( see , e.g. harnik _ et .",
    "al . _ in @xcite ) could change the results we presented .",
    "finally , we point out that very mild variations are appreciated in figs .",
    "[ plot1]-[plot4 ] with respect to the independent variables .",
    "decay probabilities are slightly larger for smaller @xmath20 and @xmath95 and for larger @xmath82 and @xmath123 ( max@xmath124 ) . +",
    "flavor violation has shown up in the quark and neutrino sectors .",
    "although extremely suppressed in the sm extended with right - handed neutrinos , it may appear at measurable rates in several well - motivated new physics models .",
    "on the other hand , the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc has brought a new scenario to search for lfv in the decays of this scalar . an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem on the higgs mass",
    "is provided by the lh models . here",
    ", we have considered the slh model ( one of the simplest realizations of these ideas ) against the atlas and cms limits on @xmath125 , of order percent .",
    "given the lu of the slh model , it is not surprising that the model can not simultaneously account for the tiny rate at which the @xmath1 decays must proceed ( @xmath126 ) and also for a measurable signal at lhc .",
    "we have found that a @xmath122 as low as @xmath127 is obtained naturally ( even allowing for three heavy neutrinos , which increases the predicted decay rates with respect to the scenario with two heavy neutral leptons ) , with @xmath93 only enhanced by a factor of order @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the confirmation of the cms hint would disfavor the slh model , as it will do a measurement at belle - ii of semileptonic lfv tau decays @xcite .",
