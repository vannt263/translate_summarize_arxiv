    "we shall discuss the scaling law , called geometrical scaling ( gs ) , which has been introduced in the context of dis @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that gs is exhibited by the @xmath4 spectra at the lhc @xcite@xcite and that an onset of gs can be seen in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies @xcite . at low bjorken @xmath5 gluonic cloud in the proton",
    "is characterized by an intermediate energy scale @xmath6 , called saturation scale @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is defined as the border line between dense and dilute gluonic systems ( for review see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we study the consequences of the very existence of @xmath6 ; the details of saturation phenomenon are here not of primary importance .    here",
    "we shall focus of four different pieces of data which exhibit both emergence and violation of geometrical scaling . in sect .",
    "[ method ] we briefly describe the method used to assess the existence of gs .",
    "secondly , in sect .",
    "[ dis ] we describe our recent analysis  @xcite of combined hera data @xcite where it has been shown that gs in dis works surprisingly well up to relatively large @xmath7 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "next , in sect .",
    "[ pplhc ] , on the example of the cms @xmath1 spectra in central rapidity @xcite , we show that gs is also present in hadronic collisions . for particles produced at non - zero rapidities , one ( larger ) bjorken @xmath8 may be outside of the domain of gs , _ i.e. _ @xmath9 , and violation of gs should appear . in sect .",
    "[ ppna61 ] we present analysis of the pp data from na61/shine experiment at cern @xcite and show that gs is indeed violated once rapidity is increased .",
    "finally in sect .",
    "[ gsids ] we analyze identified particles spectra where the particle mass provides another energy scale which may lead to the violation of gs , or at least to some sort of its modification @xcite .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "geometrical scaling hypothesis means that some observable @xmath10 depending in principle on two independent kinematical variables , like @xmath11 and @xmath12 , depends in fact only on a given combination of them , denoted in the following as @xmath13 : @xmath14 here function @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ gsdef ] ) is a dimensionless universal function of scaling variable @xmath13 : @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the saturation scale . here",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are free parameters which , however , are not of importance in the present analysis , and exponent @xmath20 is a dynamical quantity of the order of @xmath21 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall test the hypothesis whether different pieces of data can be described by formula ( [ gsdef ] ) with _ constant _ @xmath20 , and what is the kinematical range where gs is working satisfactorily .    as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ gsdef ] ) observables @xmath22 for different @xmath23 s should fall on a universal curve , if evaluated in terms of scaling variable @xmath13 .",
    "this means that ratios @xmath24 should be equal to unity independently of @xmath13 . here for some @xmath25 we pick up all @xmath26 which have at least two overlapping points in @xmath12 .    for @xmath27 points of the same @xmath28 but different @xmath11 s correspond in general to different @xmath13 s .",
    "therefore one has to interpolate @xmath29 to @xmath30 such that @xmath31 .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .    by adjusting",
    "@xmath20 one can make @xmath32 for all @xmath33 in a given interval . in order to find an optimal value @xmath34 which minimizes deviations of ratios ( [ rxdef ] ) from unity we form",
    "the chi - square measure@xmath35 where the sum over @xmath36 extends over all points of given @xmath23 that have overlap with @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is a number of such points .",
    "in the case of dis the relevant scaling observable is @xmath39 cross section and variable @xmath11 is simply bjorken @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "[ xlamlog ] we present 3-d plot of @xmath40 which has been found by minimizing ( [ chix1 ] ) .     obtained by minimization of eq .",
    "( [ chix1]).,width=302 ]    qualitatively , gs is given by the independence of @xmath41 on bjorken @xmath11 and by the requirement that the respective value of @xmath42 is small ( for more detailed discussion see refs .",

    "charged particles multiplicity spectra exhibit gs @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath15 is a universal dimensionless function of the scaling variable ( [ taudef ] ) .",
    "therefore the method of ratios can be applied to the multiplicity distributions at different energies ( @xmath52 taking over the role of @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ rxdef ] ) ) as an inverse of ( [ rxdef ] ) ] .",
    "for @xmath54 we take the highest lhc energy of 7  tev .",

    "however , the quality of gs is the worst for the lowest energy @xmath77 . by increasing @xmath63",
    "some points fall outside the gs window because @xmath78 , and finally for @xmath79 no gs is present in na61/shine data .",
    "this is illustrated nicely in fig .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we have proposed that in the case of identified particles another scaling variable should be used in which @xmath80 is replaced by @xmath81 ( @xmath82  scaling ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath83 this choice is purely phenomenological for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , the gluon cloud is in principle not sensitive to the mass of the particle it finally is fragmenting to , so in principle one should take @xmath80 as an argument of the saturation scale . in this case",
    "the proper scaling variable would be @xmath84 however this choice ( @xmath85@xmath80  scaling ) does not really differ numerically from the one given by eq .",
    "( [ taumtdef ] ) .    to this end",
    "let us see how scaling properties of gs are affected by going from scaling variable @xmath86 ( [ taudef ] ) to @xmath87 ( [ taumtdef ] ) and what would be the difference in scaling properties if we had chosen @xmath80 as an argument in the saturation scale leading to scaling variable @xmath88 ( [ taumtpdef ] ) .",
