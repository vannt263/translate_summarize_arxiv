    "i refer e.g. to the following books @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there in addition an abundance of papers and monographs is cited , where the methods are also described in detail .",
    "a common feature of these procedures is that they contain one step in which a one - particle approximation of the n - particle problem is carried through . with the methods of thomas - fermi and of hartree - fock it is all , what is done . with the other methods the described first step",
    "is followed by other ones thereby improving the accuracy of approximation .",
    "especially , by combining analytical and numerical mathematics great progress is achieved .",
    "today problems can be solved which were regarded as unsolvable few decades ago .    nevertheless , the question is obvious , whether there are other approaches to a solution of the @xmath6-particle problem in quantum mechanics than those mentioned above .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present such a new procedure . for this purpose",
    "i need some mathematical tools which , though they are widely known , i have briefly described in appendix a.1 . in particular the reader will find all the notation which is used throughout the text .",

    "the basic idea of the procedure as well as the main results are sketched in section 2.3 .",
    "in what follows only systems of particles of the same kind are considered .",
    "when one starts studying a concrete sytem , its hamiltonian is usually defined using the position - spin representation , i.e. the hamiltonian is an operator in the hilbert space @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote tensor products , and where @xmath10 is the complex vector space of spin functions ( cf .",

    "more concretely , is it possible to find a one - particle hilbert space @xmath84 such that the dummy hamiltonian @xmath63 is defined on @xmath406 and is bounded , and such that in addition the spectrum of @xmath63 contains the discrete eigenvalues of the dummy hamiltonian @xmath66 , which is primarily defined ? _",
    "e.g. ( [ a2.1 ] ) , ( [ a2.4 ] ) , ( [ a2.6 ] ) . ) + _ second , is formula ( [ 3.56 ] ) of any advantage for the spectral problem of @xmath61 ? _ + * 4.2 : * to begin with , let us look for an answer to the first question .",
    "as is already described in subsection 2.1 , any investigation of the hamiltonian @xmath23 of an @xmath6-particle system starts with a more or less informal specification of the external fields acting upon the particles and of their interactions .",
    "customarily this is done using the position - spin representation .",
    "then @xmath23 is of the form ( [ 1.1 ] ) or , what is the same , ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "it is densely defined in a hilbert space @xmath407 .",
    "likewise the corresponding dummy hamiltonian @xmath66 can be immediately written down as is shown for two examples in appendix a2 .",
    "it is defined in a dense linear submanifold of @xmath408 .    in order to verify assumption 3.1",
    "the space @xmath409 has to be properly restricted to a subspace @xmath84 .",
    "such a restriction in turn can be carried through by finding a proper orthonormal system @xmath410 in @xmath411 so that @xmath412 .",
    "having in mind the physical meaning of @xmath84 suggests taking the hartree - fock procedure for @xmath413 to determine @xmath410 .",
    "( for the details cf . appendix a.3 .",
    ") this is because this procedure is based on the ritz variational principle which guarantees optimal approximation .",
    "disregarding the fact that the hartree - fock procedure generally is an infinite task , let us assume that it is completely carried through for the dummy hamiltonian @xmath413 in @xmath414 .",
    "thus one has obtained @xmath410 and an orthonormal system @xmath415 of vectors @xmath416 + by definition , @xmath410 is an onb of @xmath84 , therefore @xmath417 is an onb of @xmath418 .",
    "the corresponding energy levels @xmath419 for @xmath420 approximate the discrete eigenvalues of @xmath413 outside its continuous spectrum . since the hamiltonians considered in this paper are supposed to have a bounded discrete spectrum , the set of the energy levels @xmath421 is also bounded .",
    "then the restriction @xmath63 of @xmath66 to the space @xmath406 is bounded because its spectrum is approximated by the set @xmath422 and its eigenvectors by the set @xmath417 .",
    "as usual @xmath63 can be defined on the whole space @xmath406 using its matrix representation with respect to the onb @xmath417 .",
    "+ in most cases of practical application the complete hartree - fock procedure can not be achieved , because it is infinite .",
    "therefore one has to content oneself with a finite section of this procedure .",
    "but also such a finite procedure can be complicated . +",
    "thus other methods were invented which are equivalent to the hartree - fock procedure or approximate it .",
    "* 4.3 : * let us now come to the second question .",
    "from ( [ 3.56 ] ) one draws immediately a simple consequence . + * proposition 4.1 : * the matrix of the hamiltonian @xmath423 is diagonal if the matrix of the dummy hamiltonian @xmath63 is diagonal . unfortunately this result can not be used to obtain the exact discrete eigenvalues of a realistic n - particle system , because the exact eigenvectors of a dummy hamiltonian @xmath63 containing interaction are not elements of any onb @xmath424 .",
    "but , if one contents with a hartree - fock approximation of the eigenvalues of @xmath63 , proposition 4.1 delivers a hartree - fock - like approximation for the eigenvalues of @xmath61 .",
    "thus , if one wants to obtain better approximations , one has to solve the following _",
    "problem_. since the results of chapter 3 are valid for arbitrary orthonormal bases @xmath425 , one firstly has to choose such an onb and one has to calculate the matrix elements @xmath426 of @xmath427 for the onb @xmath424 . the second part of the problem then is the question , wether the choise of @xmath428 is helpful for a reasonable approximation of @xmath429 and also of @xmath430 . + a heuristic idea",
    "to cope with this problem is the following .",

    "@xmath432 such that the matrix @xmath433 of @xmath63 with respect to @xmath432 , i.e. the matrix defined by the elements @xmath426 is `` as diagonal as possible '' .",
    "this means the elements of @xmath432 should approximate the eigenvectors of @xmath63 optimally .",
    "hence we end up again with the hartree - fock method , an equivalent of it or an approximation .",
    "therefore @xmath434 and @xmath435 with @xmath436 and @xmath417 being defined in section 4.2 and in appendix 3 .    in order to get further insight into the general structure of the matrix @xmath433",
    "i will give some purely heuristic arguments , which are based on physical intuition .",
    "for this purpose let the hartree - fock energy levels @xmath437 be numbered such that @xmath438 if @xmath439 .",
    "then , if @xmath440 is large enough , i.e. if it exceeds a certain value @xmath441 one expects that the particle having state @xmath440 is `` almost '' free , so that the interaction between the two particles having the states @xmath442 and @xmath440 is `` almost '' zero .",
    "thus the two particles with states @xmath442 and @xmath440 are `` almost '' free , if one particle of this pair is `` almost '' free .",
    "this implies , that the vector @xmath443 is `` almost '' an eigenvector of @xmath63 .",

    "then @xmath445 is `` almost '' an eigenvalue of @xmath63 for the eigenvector @xmath446 , so that @xmath426 is `` almost '' equal to @xmath447 .",
    "consequently @xmath426 is `` small '' , i.e. it is `` almost '' zero , if @xmath448 .",
    "now let us suppose that the term `` small '' has been concretized .",
    "then the above considerations can be summarized in the following _",
    "_ there is a natural number @xmath441 such that @xmath449 is small for each pair @xmath295 with @xmath450 , for which a @xmath451 exists or an @xmath452 .",
    "_    this suggests truncating the matrix @xmath433 by substituting zeros for its small elements .",
    "then intuitively one conjectures that the truncated matrix leads to an approximate solution of the spectral problem of @xmath61 which is the goal of this paper .",

    "consequently , @xmath453 is bounded so that @xmath459 is also bounded and has the form ( [ 3.56 ] ) , but with @xmath460 defined by @xmath461 the same way as @xmath462 is determined by @xmath426",
