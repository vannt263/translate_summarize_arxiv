    "a wide class of nonperturbative phenomena in field theory can be understood in terms of quantum tunneling .",
    "a well - known example is the quantum decay of the false vacuum , @xcite which has been of broad scientific interest in cosmology @xcite and other fields @xcite for over two decades . in three dimensions ,",
    "the boundary between the bubble of true vacuum and the surrounding false vacuum is a type of topological defect known as a domain wall .",
    "a variety of topological defects in condensed matter systems have been proposed to nucleate via quantum or thermal fluctuations .",
    "these include vortex - antivortex pairs and vortex rings in superconductors , @xcite superfluids , @xcite and bose - einstein condensates ; @xcite dislocation pairs in wigner crystals @xcite and vortex lattices ; @xcite phase - slip vortex rings in charge density waves ( cdws ) ; @xcite charge ( or flux ) soliton - antisoliton pairs in density waves @xcite ( or josephson junctions @xcite ) ; and soliton - like domain walls surrounding cigar - shaped bubbles of true vacuum in three - dimensional cdws .",
    "@xcite the quantum decay of the metastable false vacuum of a scalar field @xmath1 , accompanied by the creation of solitons and antisolitons in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite ( or soliton domain walls in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite ) , has been studied extensively in quantum field theory .",
    "a cdw is a condensate @xcite in which the electronic charge density in a quasi-1-d metal is modulated , @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 contains the background charge of the condensed electrons , and an excess or deficiency of charge proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "weakly pinned density waves ( dws ) and weakly - coupled josephson junctions ( jjs ) can be approximately described by a phase , @xmath5 , in a sine - gordon ( s - g ) potential .",
    "they are dual in that the roles of charge and flux are interchanged , as well as those of current and voltage .",
    "the current in a density wave is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the number of parallel chains , whereas the voltage across a jj is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "charge ( flux ) solitons in a density wave ( jj ) carry a charge ( flux ) of @xmath11 ( see table i ) .",
    "the width of a josephson vortex is roughly the josephson penetration length , @xmath12 whereas , in a dw , the soliton width is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the phason velocity and @xmath15 is the pinning frequency .",
    "thus , @xmath16 will increase with decreasing impurity concentration ( as @xmath15 decreases ) , and may approach the distance between contacts in extremely pure samples .",
    "this is equivalent to approaching the short junction limit , @xmath17 , in a jj , where the _ v - i _ curves become significantly less rounded .",
    "krive and rozhavsky ( kr ) @xcite point out the existence of a coulomb blockade threshold , due to the electrostatic energy of the charged solitons and antisolitons , for the creation of soliton - antisoliton ( @xmath18 ) pairs in density waves .",
    "a more recent paper @xcite proposes an analogy to time - correlated single electron tunneling to explain the observed lack of dw polarization below threshold , and to interpret key features of dw dynamics , such as coherent oscillations and narrow - band noise , above threshold .",
    "observations of aharonov - bohm ( a - b ) oscillations @xcite in the magneto - conductance of cdws in nbse@xmath0 crystals with columnar defects provide compelling evidence for quantum transport .",
    "additional evidence for quantum behavior is found in _",
    "experiments @xcite that show good agreement with photon - assisted tunneling theory , and the observed zener - like _ i - v _ characteristics .",
    "@xcite this zener - like behavior is expected in the quantum picture when @xmath19 and the _ i - v _ curves are rounded . the linear _",
    "i - v _ curves seen in the extremely pure nbse@xmath0 samples suggest a possible coulomb blockade mechanism , the dual of which is also suggested by the by the linear _ v - i _ curves seen in cuprate jjs in the short junction limit ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "evidence against classical depinning includes bias - independent _ rf _ and microwave responses below threshold in cdws @xcite and wigner crystals , @xcite and the observed small phase displacements of charge @xcite and spin @xcite density waves below threshold .",
    "these experiments strongly suggest that , as the electric field is increased , @xmath18 or dislocation pairs are created long before the classical depinning field is attained .",
    "@xcite moreover , attempts @xcite using a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) to directly observe either displacement of the cdw below threshold or sliding above threshold have been unsuccessful .",
    "the apparent lack of sliding seen in stm experiments , the jerky dynamics revealed by nmr experiments , @xcite and the mode locking observed at high drift velocities @xcite all suggest that the cdw spends most of its time in the pinned state even above threshold .",
    "the quantum interpretation of the threshold field , as a pair - creation threshold due to coulomb blockade , is motivated by coleman s paper @xcite on soliton pair - creation in the massive schwinger model . a pair of @xmath21 and @xmath22 domain walls with charges @xmath23 produce an internal field of magnitude @xmath24 , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath25 is the cross - sectional area . when a field @xmath26 is applied , the difference in electrostatic energies of a state with a pair of separation @xmath27 and of the  vacuum \" is @xmath28 = q_{0 } l [ \\frac{1}{2}e^{\\ast } \\pm e]$ ] , which is positive when @xmath29 .",
    "conservation of energy thus forbids pair production for fields less than a quantum threshold , @xmath30 , which appears to be about two orders of magnitude smaller than the classical depinning field in nbse@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the observed universality relation , @xmath31 , @xcite thus arises quite elegantly in this model .",
    "@xcite    a density wave between two contacts behaves as a capacitor with an enormous dielectric constant ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the initial charging energy is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the displacement charge and @xmath34 .",
    "we define @xmath35 and note that a displacement @xmath1 near the middle creates a non - topological kink - antikink pair with charges @xmath36 , if @xmath37 at the contacts .",
    "the washboard pinning and quadratic charging energies can then be written as : @xcite    @xmath38=\\int_{0}^{l}dx\\,\\{u_{p}\\,[1-\\cos\\phi(x)]+   u_{c}\\,[\\theta-\\phi(x)]^{2}\\}\\ ] ]     + where the first and second terms represent the pinning and electrostatic charging energies , respectively , and where @xmath39 for nbse@xmath0 .",
    "if the system starts out in its ground state , conservation of energy will prevent tunneling when the applied field is below threshold , @xmath40 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "however , when @xmath41 exceeds @xmath42 what was formerly the true vacuum becomes the unstable false vacuum .",
    "a bubble of true vacuum , with soliton domain walls at its surface , then nucleates and expands rapidly ( fig .",
    "1 ) . @xcite after @xmath43 solitons of charge @xmath44 ( and antisolitons of charge @xmath45 ) have reached the contacts , the charging energy becomes    @xmath46     + this series of piecewise parabolas is similar to the charging energy of a single - electron tunnel junction , except that @xmath44 now represents a macroscopic charge .",
    "a single - electron transistor ( set ) @xcite consists of a gate capacitor @xmath47 coupled to an island electrode between two small capacitance tunnel junctions in series .",
    "the gate voltage modulates the _ i - v _ curves between the source and drain electrodes , with a period _ e _ in displacement charge , @xmath48 .",
    "the displacement charges @xmath49 across the two tunnel junctions are related as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a phenomenological offset charge induced during cooling .",
    "@xcite the set is related by charge - flux duality to the dc squid .",
    "the critical voltage across an set is a periodic function of @xmath52 , whereas the critical current across a squid is periodically modulated ( with period @xmath53 ) by the flux @xmath54 .",
    "the model discussed above suggests that it may be possible to demonstrate a macroscopic version of the set , by attaching a gate capacitor to an island electrode near the center of a quasi-1-d crystal with a density wave . the displacement charge induced by the gate electrode",
    "would then periodically modulate the total critical voltage between the source and drain electrodes .",
    "ideally , in the absence of any shunt conductance , the periodicity of the gate displacement charge might be expected to be @xmath55 . however , screening by the normal , uncondensed electrons will tend to reduce the effectiveness of the gate which , unlike the source and drain contacts , can not be driven by a current source . the displacement charges across the two segments of the crystal will be related as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a screening length .",
    "the total charging energy of the two segments , in this idealized model , will then be    @xmath59     + where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the capacitances of the two segments separated by the island electrode .",
    "the analogy to the set suggests that a gate voltage might modulate the _",
    "i - v _ curves between source and drain contacts , with a periodicity @xmath62 .",
    "the gate capacitance @xmath47 , and hence the attainable displacement charge @xmath52 , may have been too small to observe non - monotonic behavior in previous experiments , @xcite in which a gate electrode was fabricated directly on the crystal to form a mosfet - like structure .",
    "the soliton tunneling transistor ( stt ) , discussed in the next section , employs a much larger , 1-@xmath63f , gate capacitor coupled to an nbse@xmath0 crystal , and exhibits non - monotonic behavior .",
    "single crystals of nbse@xmath0 were employed in the experiments reported here . this material forms two independent cdws , at peierls transition temperatures of 145 k and 59 k , @xcite respectively .",
    "the peierls gap opens up over most of the fermi surface ( fs ) below the lower transition , but leaves a small portion of the fs intact , so that a significant concentration ( @xmath64 @xmath65 ) of normal , uncondensed carriers remain down to low temperatures .",
    "the geometry used in our experiment is illustrated in the inset to figure 3 , where the width of the crystal is exaggerated for clarity .",
    "the nbse@xmath0 crystal was placed onto an alumina substrate with a series of evaporated , 25-@xmath63 m wide gold contacts .",
    "the substrate was thermally anchored to a cold - finger in the vacuum shroud of an open cycle helium flow cryostat and the temperature was controlled using a lake shore temperature controller attached to a heater coil wrapped around the cold - finger . a keithley programmable _ dc _ current source injected the current between two contacts , which were bonded to the crystal near the ends using silver paint .",
    "the  source - to - drain \" voltage was measured between two additional gold contacts , as illustrated , and a 1-@xmath63f gate capacitor was attached to the center gold contact using silver paint .",
    "the spacing between contacts along the crystal was 500 @xmath63 m center - to - center , and the gate capacitor was kept inside the cryostat .",
    "we found that substantially smaller gate capacitors ( as well as gate capacitors with longer leads ) were unable to induce a periodic modulation of the _ i - v _ characteristic .",
    "moreover , _",
    "dc i - v _ ( rather than differential _",
    "dv / di _ ) measurements were necessary to avoid inducing a displacement current through the gate capacitor .",
    "a programmable voltage source was coupled to the gate capacitor via a 10-k@xmath66 resistor , which limited the current flowing through the crystal during changes in gate voltage when the gate capacitor either partially charged or discharged .",
    "the cryostat was kept inside an electromagnetically shielded enclosure , and @xmath67 was measured with a nanovoltmeter .",
    "the measurements were primarily carried out at 35 k. previous ",
    "field effect transistor \" experiments @xcite showed the greatest modulation at around 30 k , where the threshold field is near its minimum .",
    "we also observed the largest modulation , using our geometry , at comparable temperatures .",
    "we attained the best temperature stability ( better than @xmath68 k ) when the temperature was set to 35 k , and thus chose this temperature for most of the measurements reported here .",
    "figure 3 shows several plots of cdw current as a function of source - to - drain voltage , @xmath69 , in a nbse@xmath0 crystal at 35 k , for different values of gate voltage @xmath70 .",
    "the gate voltage is seen to modulate the threshold voltage in the _ i - v _ curves of fig .",
    "3 . figure 4 displays plots of source - to - drain voltage @xmath71 for three values of total bias current above threshold .",
    "the plots exhibit roughly periodic behavior , similar to that observed in sets .",
    "however , in our system , the measured periodicity @xmath72 v is consistent with a macroscopic displacement charge @xmath73 , comparable to the charge of the conducting electrons between the contacts .",
    "the behavior shown in fig .",
    "4 is quite extraordinary , and appears to be consistent with the soliton tunneling hypothesis .",
    "the number of parallel cdw chains , @xmath8 , is about @xmath74 .",
    "thus , one might estimate the screening parameter as follows : @xmath75 . assuming that @xmath76 , and taking @xmath77 to be about the distance between contacts ( @xmath78 m ) , yields an effective screening length @xmath79 of about 40 @xmath63 m .",
    "however , an alternative interpretation for the observed periodicity might be that all of the normal electrons between the contacts participate in screening out the displacement charge @xmath44 of the cdw .",
    "thus , the observation that @xmath80 is roughly the number of conducting electrons between contacts may not be a coincidence .",
    "further work is needed to better understand the effects of screening by the normal , uncondensed electrons .",
    "we believe that phase - coherent , josephson - like tunneling of many microscopic degrees of freedom enables quantum transport to dominate at all temperatures below the peierls transition temperature , @xmath81 .",
    "on the one hand , the observation of complete mode locking with an @xmath82 source in high quality crystals @xcite shows that the phase is coherent throughout macroscopic regions within the crystal . on the other hand , magneto - transport experiments on nbse@xmath0 crystals with columnar defects @xcite",
    "demonstrate aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations with a periodicity of @xmath83 , and not @xmath84 as predicted theoretically @xcite , where @xmath85 is the number of coupled chains .",
    "these apparently contradictory results can be reconciled by treating a density wave as a condensate containing many quantum degrees of freedom within a phase - coherent volume .",
    "this suggests writing down a hamiltonian in terms of the phases of individual standing waves created by the dressed electrons , coupled to the @xmath86 phonons , in the cdw condensate :    @xmath87 , \\label{eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath88 , @xmath89 is related to the coupling between nearby chains ( or transverse wavevectors ) , and    @xmath90    + e^{'}_{c } [ \\phi_{n\\sigma}-\\theta]^{2 } \\right\\ } + u^{'}[1-\\cos(\\phi_{n\\uparrow}-\\phi_{n\\downarrow } ) ] .",

    "the effective charge of @xmath99 observed in the ab experiments suggests that the coupling u between the two spin components is strong compared to the other coupling terms , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "we thus take @xmath101 to be nonzero in our calculations , and consider the case where @xmath102 . alternatively ,",
    "if the phases @xmath103 and @xmath104 are taken to be identical ( i. e. , if @xmath105 ) , our model can be treated as one in which pairs of chains are coupled .    in the variational approach",
    ", the energy is minimized to estimate the ground - state wavefunctions and energies for different values of @xmath41 .",
    "because a cdw is highly dissipative , the system will tend to quickly relax to its lowest energy state .",
    "in the variational method , the energy expectation value    @xmath106    is minimized by setting @xmath107 to estimate the ground state energy .",
    "the wavefunctions of the system @xmath108 are approximated as superpositions of sharply peaked gaussians centered at the pinning potential minima .",
    "the state of the system , incorporating the two spin components , is described as a trial function with properties that depend on the parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 ,    @xmath111 \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ \\psi[\\phi_{n\\sigma } ]   & = &   \\prod_{n\\sigma}\\chi(\\phi_{n\\sigma}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + the coefficients @xmath109 asymptotically approach _ zero _ as @xmath112 approaches _ infinity_. we set @xmath113 in eq .",

    "the periodic behavior of the source - to - drain voltage vs. gate voltage of an stt can readily be understood by exploiting the duality with a dc squid .",

    "7 , although rather simplistic , provides at least a preliminary , qualitative interpretation of our experimental results .",
    "we have carried experiments which , combined with our modeling studies , provide further evidence for a quantum mechanism of cdw transport . the use of wave functions , in eq .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) , is based on the approximation that the @xmath137 s are roughly uniform sufficiently far from the kink and antikink .",
    "an extension of the model would employ wave _ functionals _ that incorporated spatial variations of the phases @xmath138 . a soliton domain wall",
    "could then be viewed as a condensate of a microscopic quantum solitons .",
    "the wave functional approach to quantum field theory , together with a non perturbative treatment of the functional schrdinger equation , has previously been discussed in the context of qcd , @xcite scalar 2-d qed , @xcite and ( 1 + 1)-d quantum gravity .",
    "@xcite    further refinements might include the addition of disorder to the s - g pinning potential , which would enable a description of metastability , hysteresis , and related phenomena .",
    "krive and rozhavskii @xcite have studied the effective lagrangian for macroscopic quantum tunneling of a cdw in a random medium , and have found that disorder significantly enhances the tunneling rate . a quantum version of a modified fukuyama - lee - rice ( flr ) model , @xcite which included the electrostatic charging energy due to spatial variations of the phase , would provide a more realistic description of many aspects of the problem .",
    "however , we believe it is also important to incorporate the numerous microscopic degrees of freedom when calculating the effective action relevant for tunneling . we are thus exploring a generalization of the tunneling hamiltonian @xcite to the case of matrix elements between wave functionals of scalar fields representing these degrees of freedom .    the quantum decay of the false vacuum , accompanied by the nucleation of topological defects , is a far - reaching problem , which could impact many areas of physics . for example ,",
    "topological defects , such as flux vortices , play an important role in the cuprates and other type - ii superconductors .",
    "@xcite magnetic relaxation rates that depend weakly on temperature up to 20 k , @xcite or even decrease with temperature , @xcite suggest that abrikosov vortices may tunnel over a wide temperature range .",
    "moreover , the consistently low @xmath139 products of cuprate josephson devices suggest that josephson vortex - antivortex pair creation @xcite may occur when the current is much smaller than theclassical \" critical current @xmath140 . in cosmology",
    ", the existence of many matter fields may facilitate quantum nucleation of a universe even when the total action is large , as suggested by hawking et al .",
