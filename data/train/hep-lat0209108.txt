    "despite the full understanding of the fundamental theory of weak interactions , the non - leptonic decay of hadrons still remains as the least understood of weak processes , the most notable problems being the @xmath1 rule and the value of @xmath2 .",
    "the predicament originates from the difficulty of evaluating the @xmath0 decay amplitudes . in spite of recent progress of computational power ,",
    "the calculation of the decay amplitude by lattice qcd simulations is much more difficult than those of hadron masses .",
    "there are two difficulties in the calculations , one of which is the operator matching of @xmath3-fermion weak operators , and the other is the problems first pointed out by maiani and testa  @xcite .    for the @xmath1 decay process , operator mixings with lower dimensional operators can occur .",
    "since these operators do not contribute to the physical decay amplitude , we have to subtract the effect of these in a non - perturbative manner .",
    "the non - perturbative subtraction is not easy numerically , but explicit methods have been proposed and carried out in actual lattice calculations .",
    "the details are reviewed in ref .",
    "a recent progress is the realization that twisted mass qcd approach may provide a powerful tool for solving the operator mixing  @xcite .",
    "the most serious problem in the evaluation of the decay amplitude was pointed out by maiani and testa  @xcite .",
    "we have to calculate the decay amplitude into a two - pion state with non - zero momenta . however , it is non - trivial to extract it from the corresponding green s function @xmath4 , since the two - pion state with non - zero momenta is an excited state in the two - pion system .",
    "this problem of extraction of the decay amplitude is one of the problems pointed out by maini and testa , which we shall refer to as `` mt-1 '' in this article .    to avoid this problem , in most of lattice calculations ,",
    "the decay amplitudes are calculated either at an un - physical kinematics or through the @xmath5 amplitudes and chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) relating these amplitudes to the physical decay amplitudes .",
    "using such an effective theory , however , is the cause for large uncertainties of the lattice prediction of the decay amplitude .    even if we succeed in overcoming the mt-1 and extract the decay amplitude at the physical kinematics from the green s functions , another problem exists .",
    "since lattice simulations are carried out on a finite euclidean space - time , the decay amplitude on the lattice does not directly give the physical one in the infinite volume minkowski space - time .",
    "this problem of the relation between the lattice and the physical amplitude is another part of the maini ",
    "testa problem , which we shall call as `` mt-2 '' in this article .",

    "they also examined the conditions for the validity of the relation .    in this article",
    "i focus on the maini - testa problems .",
    "recent theoretical and numerical progress for avoiding or solving the mt-1 will be discussed .",
    "we also show a brief derivation of the relation by lellouch and lscher .",

    "the energy @xmath21 satisfies the lscher quantization condition  @xcite .",
    "the state @xmath23 is the zero momentum @xmath13 meson state and @xmath24 .",
    "the crucial point is that @xmath25 in ( [ gkpp_2 ] ) generally , because the interpolating field @xmath26 has no definite energy and it can emit the state @xmath19 with @xmath27 .",
    "thus , @xmath28 contains many exponential terms generally .",
    "the extraction of the decay amplitude from such a multi - exponential function is not trivial . for @xmath29 , for example , the dominant contributions of @xmath28 for the large time region come from the states with @xmath30 , and the effects from these states disturb extraction of the amplitude @xmath31 .",
    "a special case is @xmath32 , for which we can extract the amplitude by a single exponential fitting , because contaminations from lower states are absent .",
    "there are three methods known for avoiding the mt-1 .",
    "these are to calculate the green s functions for the amplitudes of ( 1 ) @xmath33  @xcite , ( 2 ) @xmath5  @xcite , and ( 3 ) @xmath34 at @xmath35 ( spqr kinematics )  @xcite . as we noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : mt-1 ] , the mt-1 does not apply to the zero momentum two - pion . further this is also true in case ( 3 ) , because only one state is dominant for the large time region .",

    "this is not the case for the @xmath1 amplitude . since the correction factor depends on the weak operators due to the lack of unitarity in quenched qcd , the simple relation from @xmath67 to @xmath66",
    "can not be obtained  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the ll - formula given by ( [ ll_f ] ) is relied on the lscher quantization condition which holds for the energy on a finite periodic box in the two - pion center of mass frame .",
    "the formula is not applicable to the spqr kinematics which is in the laboratory frame .",
    "an extension of the ll - formula to the general frame can be obtained easily using the rummukaine - gottlieb quantization condition for the general frame  @xcite .",
    "we note that the formula can not be applied for the @xmath71-periodic boundary condition , because the anti - periodic boundary is imposed in the @xmath178-direction .",
    "extending the formula to this case is not trivial , since the condition on the energy in such a boundary condition is not known .",
    "lin _ et al .",
    "_ derived the ll - formula from a different approach  @xcite .",
    "they found the following simple relation between the two - pion state @xmath210 in the physical decay amplitude and that on the lattice @xmath211 at general energy @xmath191 : @xmath212 .",
    "this gives the extension of the ll - formula to the case of @xmath213 .",
    "they also investigated the validity of the ll - formula , and found that the volume has to be sufficiently large or the two - pion interaction has to be weak enough , so that the boundary condition does not distort the two - pion wave function .",
    "this is also required for the lscher quantization condition .    at present",
    "there are few studies of the two - pion system , and informations are scarce of the two - pion wave functions .",
    "it is extremely important to investigate the two - pion system , before embarking on a numerical application of the ll - formula to the @xmath0 decay amplitude .",
    "in this article we discussed recent theoretical and numerical progresses in the calculation of the @xmath0 decay amplitude . while this calculation has been plagued with a number of difficulties , we discussed that most of them had been shown to be theoretically solvable .",
    "in particular , the mt-1 can be avoided by a judicious choice of kinematics and boundary conditions or can be solved by diagonalizations , in principle .    in our opinion ,",
    "the most desirable way of calculating the decay amplitude is the following .",
    "we extract the decay amplitude from the @xmath0 green s function directly using the spqcdr method or one of new ideas described in previous sections .",
    "we then reconstruct the physical decay amplitude from that on the lattice by the ll - formula or its extensions without using effective theories of qcd .    in this procedure ,",
    "a quantitative study of the two - pion system is necessary to examine the validity of the ll - formula .",
    "also all calculations should be made in full qcd to avoid uncontrollable quenching problems due to the lack of unitarity in the quenched qcd .",
    "the final obstacle to avoid using effective theories in the actual lattice calculations is chiral extrapolation .",
    "practical lattice simulations are carried at @xmath214 .",
    "we have to extrapolate our decay amplitude obtained by the ll - formula to that at the physical mass with some assumption for the mass dependence . here",
    "effective theories such as chpt is used .",
    "this causes large uncertainties in the lattice prediction of the decay amplitude , because there is no reliable effective theory for such a long extrapolation .",
    "a unique solution to this problem is a simulation at or near the physical point .",
