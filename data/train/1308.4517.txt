    "dilute magnetic insulators constitute an emerging class of magnetic semiconductors in which rather than the @xmath8 zener mechanism  @xcite , _ ferromagnetic _ superexchange accounts for the coupling between diluted transition metal ( tm ) spins  @xcite .",
    "due to its compatibility with iii - nitrides that have reached the status of the most important semiconductors next to si , particularly attractive is ga@xmath0mn@xmath1n , in which there are no itinerant holes but nevertheless ferromagnetic spin - spin interactions are observed  @xcite .",
    "recent progress in epitaxy , contamination - free processing , and ( nano)characterization  @xcite allowed the preparation of ga@xmath0mn@xmath1n films with the randomly distributed mn@xmath4 ions up to @xmath9 showing @xmath5 up to about 13  k  @xcite despite the absence of itinerant carriers .",
    "a high degree of crystallinity , a random distribution of the mn ions , and a weak degree of compensation by residual donors were checked in these samples by a range of electron microscopy , synchrotron radiation , ion beam , optical , and magnetic resonance techniques  @xcite .",
    "the above experimental results were successfully described by the present authors within a tight binding approach ( tba ) and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations  @xcite indicating that _ ferromagnetic _ superexchange accounts for ferromagnetism in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1n with randomly distributed localized mn@xmath4 spins . within this model , a change of the mn charge from 3 + to 2 + results in antiferromagnetic superexchange that dominates in intrinsic ii - vi diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) such as cd@xmath0mn@xmath1te  @xcite and , presumably , in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1n containing a sizable concentration of compensating donor defects . here",
    "we discuss briefly the theoretical approach allowing to understand ferromagnetism in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1n .",
    "blinowski , kacman and majewski  @xcite developed a theory of superexchange interactions between substitutional tm ions in zinc - blende semiconductor compounds .",
    "the magnetic ions were described in terms of parmenter s generalization of the anderson hamiltonian for the relevant electronic configuration of the tm , taking into account the jahn - teller distortion , whereas the host band structure was modeled by the @xmath10 tba .",
    "they calculated numerically the energy of exchange interaction between cr@xmath11 ions for zinc chalcogenides ( zns , znse , znte ) and found that the superexchange is _",
    "ferromagnetic_.    we realized that this theory can be adopted for ga@xmath0mn@xmath1n @xcite , where holes introduced by the mn acceptors are tightly bound , so that no insulator - to - metal transition occurs up to at least @xmath9  @xcite . under these conditions , there are no itinerant carriers and the mn ions assume the @xmath12 charge state characterized by the electron configuration identical to cr@xmath11 substitutional cations in cr - doped zinc - blende ii - vi zinc chalcogenides  @xcite . in addition , the lack of mixed valence ( all mn ions are in the same 3 + charge state ) , precludes the presence of double exchange .",
    "in this situation , the superexchange accounts for the spin - spin interactions .",
    "its sign is determined by the anderson - goodenough - kanamori rules .",
    "gan has a wurtzite ( wz ) structure with @xmath13 0.3188 nm and @xmath14 0.5185 nm .",
    "hence , to obtain the zinc - blende ( zb ) analogue with identical density of cation sites , we take the lattice parameter , @xmath15 0.45 nm . here",
    "@xmath16 , whereas for the `` perfect '' wz structure @xmath17 . in the equivalent zb structure , in the fcc cation sublattice ,",
    "we name @xmath18 `` the diameter of hard touching spheres '' , i.e. @xmath19 . in the fcc lattice ,",
    "the distance of the @xmath20th nearest neighbors ( nns ) up to the 16th ones @xcite , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "there are no neighbors at distance @xmath23 and further away at distance @xmath24 .",
    "we mention that fcc and hcp ( corresponding to the wz structure ) have the same number of 1st and 2nd nearest neighbors , i.e. 12 and 6 , respectively , as well as at the same distances , i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the differences start at greater distances , e.g. fcc has 24 3rd nearest neighbors at distance @xmath26 , while hcp has 2 3rd nearest neighbors at a distance @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "however , overall , fcc and hcp have the same atomic packing factor @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , hcp and fcc have almost identical _ bond _ percolation threshold ( @xmath29 ) and _ site _ percolation threshold ( @xmath30 ) for nearest neighbors  @xcite .",
    "hence , wz - gan can be approximated by zb - gan in a first decent approach .",
    "the calculations of the exchange energies @xmath2 are performed for zinc - blende gan , i.e. the cationic sublattice is fcc .",
    "the host band structure is modeled by the @xmath10 tba , employing the established parametrization for gan in the cubic approximation @xcite .",
    "the integrals over the brillouin zone are performed using 2048 @xmath31-points .",
    "this guarantees that @xmath2 are computed with an accuracy of 0.0002 k.    the magnetic ions are described in terms of the parmenter hamiltonian taking into account the jahn - teller distortion @xcite . since the effect of spin - orbit splitting is small in the valence band of gan , the spin - dependent interaction between two ga - substitutional mn spins is described by a scalar heisenberg coupling @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the @xmath35 orbital ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , or @xmath38 ) which is empty at the mn@xmath4 ions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",

    "the magnitudes of @xmath42 are evaluated within the fourth - order perturbation theory in @xmath43 for all possible orbital configurations @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "similarly to the case of cr@xmath11 ions in ii - vi compounds @xcite the main contribution originates from quantum hopping involving occupied @xmath35 orbitals at the one mn@xmath4 ion and the empty orbital at the other mn@xmath4 ion . for the orbital configurations in question , we find that the averaged over the shell interaction is ferromagnetic at all distances .",
