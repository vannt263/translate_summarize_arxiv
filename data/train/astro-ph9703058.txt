    "the utility of deriving galaxy redshifts from photometric data has long been known ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite developed an empirical approach as opposed to the previous model fitting methods . utilizing photographic data",
    ", they were able to estimate a redshift out to @xmath4 with a measured dispersion of @xmath5 .",
    "the uncertainties in that result were dominated by the photometric errors .",
    "simulations indicated that with improved photometry the dispersion within the relationship could be significantly reduced . as a result",
    ", we have embarked on an observational program designed to obtain deep ccd multi - band photometry in existing redshift fields .    in this paper",
    "we present the first results of this survey by extending the previous approach using ccd photometry .",
    "section two outlines the basic reduction steps taken in the preparation of the sample for this work .",
    "section three discusses the actual fitting techniques and investigates the intrinsic dispersion .",
    "we conclude this letter with a discussion of the ramifications of this work and possible future directions .",
    "the photometric data used in this analysis were taken using the pfccd camera with the standard @xmath0filters on the mayall 4 m at kitt peak national observatory on the nights of march 31 @xmath6 april 3 , 1995 , march 18@xmath620 , 1996 , and may 14@xmath616 , 1996 .",
    "this camera uses a @xmath7 ccd ( _ t2 kb _ ) with a @xmath8/pixel scale and a read noise of @xmath9/pixel .",
    "the gain used for these observations was @xmath10 , a value which resulted from a tradeoff between maximizing the available dynamic range and minimizing the effects of the charge depletion problem with the ccd electronics .",
    "these observations were chosen to coincide with the published 14 hour redshift field of the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) .",
    "a complete discussion of the observational program including an analysis of the custom reduction software are beyond the scope of this letter and will be published elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "all three runs were reduced separately using the standard iraf routines .",
    "the images were initially debiased and flat fielded using dome flats .",
    "illumination corrections were created by stacking the image frames in each filter , with high and low rejection to remove objects , and then boxcar smoothing the stacked image .",
    "the individual fields were registered to a common position in each filter , and then stacked using a weighted average .",
    "the weights were determined by measuring the signal to noise for several randomly chosen stars on each frame .",
    "the stacked images for each filter were then registered to a common image to simplify the photometric measurement in matched apertures .",
    "the final images for each of the three runs were then registered and stacked again using the weighted average .",
    "object detection and photometry were performed using a custom pipeline .",
    "the object detection was done separately in each filter using the sextractor package ( @xcite ) .",
    "the separate detections in each filter were then matched using a growing annulus technique in the order of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , then @xmath14 and a master detection list was produced . using this list , photometry was determined in both sextractor s modified kron ( @xcite ) aperture and a @xmath15 diameter aperture matched in each band .",
    "the actual photometry algorithm used involved a modification to sextractor in both the background calculation and pixel assignment within the aperture of interest .",
    "the detections were photometrically calibrated using published standards ( @xcite ) which were measured at similar airmasses to the object frames .",
    "the photometric zeropoint was then adjusted to the ab system ( @xcite ) using published transformations ( @xcite ) : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "astrometric transformations were determined from the _",
    "hst  _ guide star catalog ii ( @xcite ) , after which the redshifts in the canada france redshift survey ( cfrs ) 14 hour field were matched to our photometric sample .",
    "the measured dispersion between the cfrs @xmath20 isophotal magnitudes and our @xmath20 automatic magnitudes was @xmath21 to @xmath22 with no evident systematic deviations from a linear relationship .",
    "in an effort to minimize the dispersion in our relationship , we imposed two conditions on the data used in this analysis .",
    "first , we restricted the photometric sample such that all object magnitudes were below the appropriate magnitude limit at which a typical galaxy had a measured @xmath23 magnitude error of approximately @xmath24 magnitudes .",
    "second , we required that only the most reliable spectroscopic identifications be incorporated into the fitting procedure .",
    "this involved pruning the cfrs catalog such that only non - stellar objects with redshifts having a confidence greater than 95% were retained .",
    "this was accomplished by restricting the redshifts used to the following quality classes : 3,4,8,93,94,98 ( _ cf .  _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the final sample contained 89 redshifts with the following distribution : 40 redshifts in the range ( 0.0 , 0.4 ] and 49 redshifts in the range ( 0.4 , 0.8 ] .",
    "for these two subsets , we fit a second order polynomial in _ u b r i  _ , _ u b r  _ , and _",
    "b r i  _ to the measured photometry and published redshifts . in each region , the degrees of freedom remained a substantial fraction of the original data ( a second order fit in four variables requires 15 parameters ) .",
    "this technique is a simple approach designed to quantify the accuracy of our method for estimating redshifts and is not the optimal parameterization of the topology of the galaxy distribution , which is the subject of ongoing work .",
    "the redshift intervals were not chosen randomly .",
    "this technique has been previously shown to be more sensitive to broad spectroscopic continuum features ( primarily the break in the continuum spectra at around 4000  , which moves between the @xmath11 and @xmath13 bands at @xmath25 , and the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands at @xmath26 ) rather than specific absorption / emission features ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in table [ tableone ] where the standard deviation in the redshift range ( 0.0,0.4 ] is only slightly higher when the @xmath14 band is not included in the fit . on the other hand ,",
    "when the @xmath12 band is excluded from the fit , the standard deviation more than doubles .",
    "this reflects the fact that the @xmath14 band is sampling the same flat region of the spectrum as the @xmath13 band within this redshift range , and is thereby providing predominantly redundant information to the fit . in the second redshift range , the continuum break is moving from the @xmath11 band into the @xmath13 band , which is reflected in the lower significance of the @xmath12 band information .",
    "we also show the expected intrinsic dispersion in this relationship from simulations using all four bands ( _ cf .  _",
    "@xcite ) , which clearly shows that our measured dispersion is completely dominated by the intrinsic scatter within the relationship .",
    "the relative importance of the different bands in the individual redshift intervals reflects the curvature inherent within the distribution of galaxies in the multi - dimensional magnitude space . in a given redshift range , the curvature is accurately parameterized by a second order polynomial . between redshift intervals",
    ", however , the distribution displays a higher order curvature term ( _ cf .  _ the previous discussion concerning the continuum break ) , which requires the use of a piecewise second - order parameterization . as a result , the application of these results requires an iterative approach .",
    "first , a third order global photometric redshift relation is used to determine an approximate redshift . from this initial redshift estimate , the appropriate second - order relationship",
    "can then be used .",
    "if the initial estimate is on the border between two subsets ( @xmath27 $ ] ) , both relationships should be applied and the mean of the two results used .    with the introduction of the four - vector @xmath28",
    ", the second - order photometric - redshift relationships can be summarized in the following manner : @xmath29 where the scalar @xmath30 , vector @xmath31 , and matrix @xmath32 components are listed in table [ tabletwo ] for the two different redshift regimes .",
    "the parameters for the third order fit are listed in table [ tablethree ] .",
    "we have shown that using a simple iterative process , redshifts can be reliably estimated for objects from broadband photometry out to @xmath33 .",
    "a comparison of our measured dispersion with the published intrinsic dispersion from simulations ( @xcite ) indicates that we have approached the inherent scatter within the photometric - redshift relationship .",
    "these simulations provide an absolute lower limit to the intrinsic scatter , as they only assumed an evolved ( 15 gigayear ) sed .",
    "as the additional effects of metallicity , dust , and stellar histories can only increase the scatter within the relationship , we do not include them in our estimation of the minimal intrinsic scatter within the photometric - redshift relation .",
    "thus it is quite remarkable that we measure such a small scatter as compared to the simple , single age , solar metallicity , and dust free galaxies produced in the simulations .",
    "actual galaxies are clearly more complex , spanning a wide range of star formation histories , ages , metallicities , and dust content , all of which would be expected to significantly increase the measured dispersion .",
    "we see that this is not the case , which leads us to two related conclusions .",
    "first , this technique is extremely dependent on the @xmath34   break which is present in nearly all galaxies .",
    "second , metallicity , dust , and age variations have similar effects in this multidimensional space , albeit almost orthogonal to the redshift vector ( @xcite ) .",
    "we plan on improving our understanding of the multidimensional nature of the observed galaxy population through the use of sed modeling .",
    "this will allow us to quantify the importance of the metallicity , dust , and different stellar histories and explore any possible degeneracies .",
    "the photometric - redshift estimation technique can be considered to be the equivalent of a low resolution ( 4 element ) spectrograph . by using more filters that are increasingly narrow",
    ", we increase the spectral resolution of this technique . taken to the extreme , however",
    ", this approach will emulate a spectrograph , losing the observing efficiency that is the primary advantage of this technique . from a comparison between the dispersion from the three band and the four band quadratic fits , it is clear that a marginal gain is achieved by adding a fourth band within a given redshift regime . as a result , we believe that the benefits achieved by adding more bands to this approach is more than offset in the loss of observational efficiency .",
    "the simulations used the standard @xmath0filters in order to be reliably compared to our observations .",
    "we are working to extend this analysis in two principal areas .",
    "first , we are now focusing on improving our understanding of the distribution of galaxies in this multi - dimensional flux space .",
    "this requires the use of a stratified sampling strategy to obtain redshifts throughout the photometric sample .",
    "these additional redshifts are primarily being obtained using the keck telescope within the deep collaboration .",
    "in addition , we are incorporating additional physical parameters ( _ eg .",
    "_ surface brightness and shape parameters ) via _ hst  _ wfpc2 imaging to quantify the different morphological tracts within the cumulative galaxy distribution .",
    "second , we are extending this work to higher redshifts . for redshifts below @xmath35",
    ", we are working to increase the size and stratification of our redshift sample .",
    "this involves increasing our photometry - redshift catalog through the addition of published redshifts and our participation in several spectroscopic surveys . in the redshift region @xmath36",
    ", we are adding near - infrared photometry to our catalog in order to sample the continuum features our technique requires .",
    "until a large quantity of reliable spectra can be obtained within this region ( the arrival of the blue camera on lris will help alleviate this quandary ) , we will use our understanding of the @xmath37 regime and the published high @xmath38 work of others ( @xcite ) as boundary conditions .",
    "we can then use sed models to extrapolate into this region , while maintaining the boundary condition requirements at both redshift ends .",
    "as spectra in this area become available , we will add them into the fitting procedure .",
    "eventually this work will allow for the estimation of not only the redshift , but also the spectral type of an object solely from broadband photometry .",

    "we also would like to thank the referee for useful comments , and barry lasker , gretchen greene , and brian mclean for allowing us access to an early version of the gsc ii .",
