    "in conclusion , we have discussed the coreless vortex states and the corresponding spin textures in rotating two - component becs with and without internal coherent coupling .",
    "the axisymmteric and nonaxisymmetric structure of the spin texture have been discussed by exploring the nl@xmath1 m derived from the gross - pitaevskii energy functional .",
    "the variational function of the spin profile , which is based on the exact solution of the classical nl@xmath1 m , provides a good description of the coreless vortex states .",
    "this variational method also improves greatly the usual analytical approach based on the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite . in the case of su(2 ) symmetry , these two spin textures are equivalent topological excitations and transform to each other by a global rotation of the pseudospin .",
    "we have discussed the effect of the su(2)-symmetry breaking contributions , inequality of the three coupling constants @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath229 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 term ) and the rabi frequency @xmath59 , on the spin textures .",
    "these contributions are interpreted as a longitudinal and transverse magnetic field and a spin - spin interaction in the nl@xmath1 m . for an axisymmetric skyrmion ( a nonaxisymmetric meron - pair ) ,",
    "the @xmath60 and @xmath61 term ( @xmath59 term ) affect the optimized size of the topological excitation , but do not break the radial symmetry of the problem .",
    "inclusion of all those terms makes a topological excitation characterized by an anisotropic distribution of the vorticity and the topological charge density .",
    "one of the open problems is to study vortex states in a ferromagnetic regime .",
    "rich spin textures are expected with the combination of the ferromagnetic feature leading to spin - domain formation and a rotational effect , e.g. , a rotating domain - wall cross (  propellers \" ) @xcite and  serpentine \" vortex sheets @xcite .",
    "the problem of their stability remains to be investigated .",
    "furthermore , it is necessary to study in more detail lattices of spin textures which appear in the rapidly rotating two - component becs , where we can expect a richer phase diagram and structural phase transitions of the vortex phases @xcite .",
    "it is also of interest to extend the pseudospin model to two - component fermion systems in view of the rapid progress in ultracold fermions after the observation of condensation of fermionic pairs @xcite ; rapidly rotating two - component fermions @xcite may exhibit phenomena analogous to what has been discussed in double - layer quantum hall systems .",
