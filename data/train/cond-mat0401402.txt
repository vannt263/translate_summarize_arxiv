    "when an ultracold atomic vapor is placed into an atom waveguide with sufficiently tight transverse confinement , its two - body scattering properties are strongly modified .",
    "this occurs in a regime of low temperatures and densities where transverse oscillator modes are frozen and the dynamics is described by a one - dimensional ( 1d ) hamiltonian with zero - range interactions @xcite , a regime which has already been reached experimentally @xcite .",
    "in addition , a regime with chemical potential @xmath4 less than transverse level spacing @xmath5 but @xmath6 has been achieved @xcite .",
    "we assume herein that both @xmath7 and @xmath8 as in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , _ virtually _ excited transverse modes renormalize the effective 1d coupling constant via a confinement - induced resonance , as first shown for bosons @xcite and recently for spin - polarized fermionic vapors by granger and blume @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of an optically trapped fermi gas is richer than that of a magnetically trapped one , since the spin is not polarized .",
    "a fermi - bose mapping first used to solve the 1d hard - sphere bose gas @xcite was recently shown @xcite to provide an exact duality between effective zero - range 1d fermionic and bosonic interactions and applied to spin - polarized fermi gases @xcite .",
    "it will be shown here that this mapping and fermi - bose duality also hold for spinor fermi gases .",
    "this mapping will be exploited to reduce the degenerate spatially antisymmetric fermionic ground states to that of a spinless bose gas , which , in the 1d , zero - range interaction regime , is the lieb - liniger model which is exactly soluble in the absence of longitudinal trapping @xcite and well approximated by a local equilibrium approach in the trapped case @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that in the presence of longitudinal trapping , this fermionic ground state can be stern - gerlach spatially decomposed by a longitudinal magnetic field gradient into components with various values of total longitudinal spin .",
    "consider first the three - dimensional two - body scattering problem for spin-@xmath9 fermionic atoms .",
    "there are both s - wave scattering states , which are space symmetric and spin antisymmetric with spin eigenfunctions of singlet form @xmath10 , as well as p - wave scattering states which are space antisymmetric and spin symmetric with spin eigenfunctions of triplet form @xmath11 or @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "s - wave scattering can not occur in a spin - polarized fermi gas , but it is usually dominant in a spinor fermi gas since p - wave spatial antisymmetry suppresses short - range interactions . however , both s - wave and p - wave interactions can be greatly enhanced by feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "assume until further notice that the hamiltonian does not depend on spin .",
    "then the spin dependence of wave functions need not be indicated explicitly and they can be written as the sum of spatially even and odd parts @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "when such an atomic vapor is confined in an atom waveguide with tight transverse trapping , the dynamics becomes effectively 1d @xcite .",
    "the effective 1d interactions are determined by 1d scattering lengths @xmath16 for spatially even waves @xmath17 related to 3d s - wave scattering and spatially odd waves @xmath18 related to 3d p - wave scattering ; here @xmath19 is the relative coordinate @xmath20 for 1d scattering .",
    "these determine the @xmath21 behavior just outside the range @xmath22 of the interaction : @xmath23 @xmath16 is a known @xcite function of the 3d s - wave scattering length @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a known @xcite function of the 3d p - wave scattering volume @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 is the transverse oscillator length for the relative motion , @xmath4 is the effective mass , @xmath28 is a riemann zeta function , and @xmath29 is a hurwitz zeta function @xcite .    in the zero - range limit @xmath22 approaches @xmath30 and @xmath31 approaches @xmath32 , and eqs .",
    "( [ contact ] ) reduce to `` contact conditions '' which relate a discontinuity in @xmath33 at contact @xmath34 to @xmath35 , and a discontinuity of @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "although a discontinuity in the derivative is a well - known consequence of the zero - range delta function pseudopotential and plays a crucial role in the solution of the lieb - liniger model @xcite , discontinuities of @xmath38 itself have received little attention , although they have been discussed previously by cheon and shigehara @xcite and are implicit in the recent work of granger and blume @xcite . for an odd wave @xmath15 the discontinuity",
    "@xmath39 is a trivial consequence of antisymmetry together with the fact that a nonzero odd - wave scattering length can not be obtained in the limit @xmath40 unless @xmath41 these discontinuities are rounded off when @xmath42 , since the interior wave function interpolates smoothly between the values at @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "take the hamiltonian to be @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are even- and odd - wave pseudopotentials to be determined .",
    "@xmath51 is nonsingular for @xmath52 , but at the origin there are singular contributions .",
    "the first derivative is @xmath53\\delta(z)$ ] .",
    "the second derivative then has two contributions in addition to @xmath54 , one because in general @xmath55 and the other from the derivative of the delta function : @xmath56\\delta(z)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & [ \\psi(0+)-\\psi(0-)]\\delta^{'}(z)\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath57 term is standard in the theory of zero - range even - wave interactions , the derivative discontinuity in @xmath45 being chosen to cancel a zero - range even - wave interaction proportional to @xmath57 , but the @xmath58 term is new . to cancel it an odd - wave pseudopotential proportional to @xmath58",
    "suggests itself .",
    "however , the discontinuity in @xmath38 leads to unwanted products of delta functions unless regularizing operators are included .",
    "define two linear operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 by @xmath61\\delta(z)\\nonumber\\\\ \\hat{\\partial}_{\\pm}\\psi(z)&=&(1/2)[\\psi^{'}(0+)+\\psi^{'}(0-)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the usual dirac delta function .",
