    "while in the eikonal region we are able to make quantitatively reliable predictions with controllable expansion parameters , the black - hole production cross section can only be estimated with dimensional arguments and more precise information should wait for numerical simulations in @xmath6-dimensional general relativity .",

    "divergences have been subtracted using dimensional regularization , considering non - integer @xmath11 , but the regularization prescription is not important since the eikonalization will consistently eliminate any ultraviolet sensitivity .",

    "these effects are calculable and taken into account .",
    "however , the theoretical estimate of the signal at negative @xmath268 lies outside the range of validity of the eikonal approximation .",
    "nevertheless , this is expected to be negligible and can be safely ignored .",
    "indeed , by dimensional arguments , the differential cross section for @xmath286 is estimated to be @xmath287 , see .",
    "when compared to the signal at small @xmath52 ( @xmath288 ) , this gives a correction @xmath289 \\sim { \\cal o } [ ( m_d^2/s)^{\\frac{(n+2)^2}{n(n+1)}}]$ ] , which is smaller than the terms we have neglected in our calculation , see .",
    "notice that this complication is unavoidable in the presence of identical colliding particles , since the amplitude is symmetric in @xmath52 and @xmath290 ( @xmath291 ) .",
    "recalling our discussion of the corrections to the eikonal amplitude given in sect .",
    "[ seccoreik ] , we notice that semiclassical corrections are indeed small . in the kinematical region of interest , the second term in amounts to less than 1% for @xmath292 and @xmath242 and less than 5% for @xmath293 and @xmath242 , while the first term amounts to about 5% at @xmath294 .",
    "gravitational radiation at @xmath294 and @xmath293 gives corrections of about 7% for @xmath116 and 5% for @xmath195 , see .",
    "quantum gravity can however severely affect our signal .",
    "if the corresponding corrections had the form @xmath295 , then they would amount to 5% ( 6% ) for @xmath292 and @xmath116 ( @xmath195 ) or to 20% ( 9% ) for @xmath293 and @xmath116 ( @xmath195 ) , and they would be under control",
    ". however , it is rather likely that the dynamics taming the ultraviolet behavior of gravity sets in at energies lower than @xmath23 , enhancing these corrections .",
    "this is indeed the case of weakly - coupled strings , where in the previous estimate @xmath25 should be replaced by @xmath51 , giving an enhancement of @xmath296 .",
    "for instance , if the diffractive string production discussed in sect .",
    "[ seccor ] takes place , it will deplete the elastic channel at impact parameters smaller than @xmath297 , which is typically very close to @xmath45 , for values of @xmath23 relevant for the lhc and for weakly - coupled strings . in this case",
    ", string production could be the discovery process at the lhc .    as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig - dely ] , the background increases with @xmath253 faster than the signal , and so the best signal to background ratio is found at the smallest @xmath268 . however , small @xmath298 are not in accord with the eikonal approximation . to stay within the acceptable kinematic range of the eikonal approximation we impose the condition @xmath299 , which is equivalent to @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "we then select a maximum value of @xmath298 in order to reject the background . in our study",
    "we make a simple universal choice @xmath302 , but in practice one could choose the maximum @xmath298 using only the criterion of retaining enough events to be detected .",
    "we want to stress that this universal range of @xmath253 is chosen just for illustration , since its optimal choice depends on @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath23 is below about 2  tev , visible signals certainly can be obtained with a more stringent lower limit on @xmath253 , therefore investigating a region of smaller scattering angles , where the eikonal approximation is even more accurate .",
    "furthermore , with the current computation technology of qcd , the dijet rate in our kinematic configuration is not a precision observable to compare with theory .",
    "this is especially true at large rapidity separation .",
    "however , our gravity signal can swamp the qcd expectation most notably at smaller rapidity separation , where the hard - scattering qcd rate is smaller and more reliably known .",
    "that is partly the reason why we choose for some plots to illustrate the gravity signal in the modest interval @xmath303 .    at very large rapidity separation",
    ", the qcd dijet observable may be dominated by bfkl dynamics  @xcite , in which case a decorrelation of the azimuthal angles of the two jets ensues  @xcite .",
    "such a decorrelation is not expected in the color - singlet gravity signal .",
    "it may even be possible to use this to distinguish qcd from gravity .",
    "similarly , the gravity signal is not expected to fill the central region with soft gluons , and the lack of this central jet activity could be an additional discriminating tool .",
    "after having selected the range of @xmath304 , we now show in fig .",
    "[ fig - mjj ] the cross - section as a function of minimum jet - jet invariant mass cut for @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "we plot results for all @xmath305 , but we recall that the eikonal approximation is valid only for @xmath306 . this plot shows the important feature that the signal cross - section is flatter in @xmath267 than the background .",
    "this enables better signal to background for larger @xmath267 cuts , which is the preferred direction to go for eikonal approximation validity .",
    "therefore , one should make the largest possible @xmath267 cut that still has a countable signal rate for a given luminosity .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig - md ] we plot the total integrated cross - section as a function of @xmath23 for @xmath307 ( left panel ) and @xmath308 ( right panel ) .",
    "we also have required @xmath309 .",
    "the two solid lines correspond to @xmath195 ( upper line ) and @xmath116 ( lower line ) .",
    "they are not far separated in this log plot .",
    "figure  [ fig - md ] demonstrates several universal features .",
    "first , larger @xmath310 corresponds to a larger ratio of gravity signal to expected qcd rate , and to a more reliable applicability of the eikonal approximation .",
    "larger @xmath310 also means less range of @xmath23 probed at the lhc since parton luminosity drops rapidly as @xmath267 approaches the @xmath311 collider limit . in this paper",
    ", we will restrict our considerations to @xmath312 and so elastic scattering with @xmath23 as large as @xmath313 can be tested with more than 10 events in @xmath314 . if we adopted the more conservative constraint @xmath315 , the range of @xmath23 where large and calculable signals are expected reduces to @xmath316 .    before concluding this section on the lhc signatures , we recall that the eikonal jet - jet observable analyzed here is not the only transplanckian non - sm process . black - hole production is also expected to be very large with a parton - parton production cross - section given approximately by @xmath317 .",
    "as discussed earlier , this is just a dimensional - analysis estimate and reflects only the expectation that all collisions with impact parameter @xmath48 get absorbed into a black hole .",
    "the description of the scattering process in terms of black - hole production is expected to be reliable only for black hole masses",
    "@xmath318 well above the @xmath6-dimensional gravity scale @xmath23 . in the left panel of fig .  [ fig - bh ]",
    "we plot the production cross - section as a function of minimum black - hole mass for @xmath278 and @xmath283 .",
    "although the lines are extended down to @xmath319 , the reliable region is only @xmath320 .",
    "the signatures of black holes are spectacular high - multiplicity events with almost no sm background  @xcite .",
    "only a few events at very high invariant mass are needed to identify a signature .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - bh ] shows the cross - section for black - hole production for @xmath321 and @xmath322 . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath314",
    ", a minimum of several events can be achieved for @xmath323 , if we require @xmath321 , or for @xmath324 if @xmath322 .",
    "these values of @xmath23 are nearly identical to what one can reach with the jet - jet observable discussed above . the combined search for black - hole production and small angle jet - jet events will be important for a full experimental characterization of the extra dimensions and for our ability to determine the underlying parameters of the theory .",
    "in addition to tevatron upgrades and lhc , there are many colliders envisioned for the future .",
    "these include variants on the @xmath325 linear collider theme , the muon collider , and the very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) .",
    "observables associated with gravity are very sensitive to collider energies .",
    "the search for phenomena of almost all beyond - the - sm schemes is interested in higher and higher energies , but gravity is especially dependent on this progress .",
    "the reason is that either the rate increases at a high power of the collision energy if @xmath326 , ( , @xmath327 for jet plus graviton signatures ) ; or , well - chosen observables become calculable if @xmath328 , ( , in the case of eikonal gravity jet - jet production ) . such calculability is taken for granted in many other beyond - the - sm frameworks .",
    "either way , the highest energies attainable are important for increased understanding if low - scale gravity is correct .",
    "we would therefore like to briefly discuss transplanckian collisions in the context of two of the highest energy colliders being considered in the not - too - distant future .",
    "the first is the vlhc  @xcite , whose center - of - mass energy for proton - proton collisions is envisaged to be between 50 tev and 200 tev .",
    "obviously the higher energy of this post - lhc machine will be much more probing .",
    "much of the analyses that we have described for the lhc would be applicable for vlhc analyses . by going to higher center - of - mass energies , we can gain in the range of sensitivity to @xmath23 and , more importantly , we can study kinematical regions where quantum - gravity effects are expected to be smaller and the eikonal approximation becomes more trustworthy .",
    "for instance , by analysing dijet final states at the vlhc with invariant masses larger than 150  tev , we can make quantum - gravity corrections ( proportional to @xmath329 ) , for a fixed value of the string scale , about a factor of 200 ( for @xmath116 ) or 6 ( for @xmath195 ) smaller than their expected size in lhc experiments .",
    "the other collider discussed at the highest currently imagined energy is clic  @xcite , which is a two - beam @xmath325 linear collider design .",
    "energies as high as @xmath330 are being considered .",
    "although such high - energy machines will have some spread in luminosity as a function of the center - of - mass energy , one still expects that approximately @xmath331 of the beam luminosity will be within 1% of designed center - of - mass energy . with large gravity - induced cross sections ( @xmath332pb or more ) for all @xmath333 , combined with relatively low background ( @xmath332fb ) and impressive luminosity design goals of @xmath334 , clic",
    "could certainly improve , verify and even discover the gravitational origin of beyond the sm signatures .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath23 that can be studied at clic in the gravitational deflection process ( bhabha scattering ) are uniquely determined by the condition for validity of the eikonal approximation . for comparison ,",
    "the condition equivalent to the one chosen in our lhc analysis is @xmath335 .",
    "therefore , a linear collider with @xmath336  tev could probe a parameter - space region , where theoretical calculations are reliable , which is very similar to the one that can be studied by lhc .",
    "however , the cleaner @xmath325 environment offer several advantages for precision tests and parameter determinations .    in fig .",
    "[ clic - theta ] we give one example of the signal and background distributions in the scattering angle @xmath117 for @xmath337  tev and @xmath330 . here",
    "@xmath117 is the scattering angle of the electron in the bhabha process , and @xmath338 indicates the electron going down the beam pipe undeflected by the collision .",
    "notice that the sm background is completely insignificant as long as we exclude a small region around @xmath339 .",
    "this allows experimental studies of the cross section in a much more forward region than what is possible at the lhc .",
    "the signal angular distribution is characterized by the peak structure encountered before , with minima and maxima described by the equation ( 1 -^2 ) = - .",
    "|_y = b_c .",
    "the first peak is approximatly given by ^(peak ) ( ) ^ , where @xmath340 is a numerical coefficient with value @xmath341 .",
    "the @xmath195 line ( solid line ) in fig .",
    "[ clic - theta ] is again the most telling line , since a careful measurement of the ups and downs of @xmath342 would be hard to reproduce in another framework .",
    "given the good energy and angular resolutions that can be achieved at a linear collider , clic could perform a much more precise study of the peak structure than what is feasible at the lhc .",
    "another advantage of clic is that unlike a @xmath343 collider , the scattering particles are distinguishable .",
    "this means that the calculable limit of @xmath163 ( small angle scattering ) is unambiguously identifiable .",
    "recall that in the @xmath343 collider case , the case of partons glancing off each other at @xmath344 was not distinguishable from partons bouncing backwards at large momentum transfer @xmath345 .",
    "we argued that these non - calculable large momentum transfer contributions are negligible , but clic can test that assertion .",
    "let us conclude by comparing the various signals and experimental strategies for the discovery and the study of higher - dimensional gravitational interactions at the lhc .",
    "the two relevant parameters are the fundamental planck mass @xmath23 and the number of extra spatial dimensions @xmath11 .",
    "we are tacitly assuming that the new dynamics of quantum gravity does not introduce a new mass scale smaller than @xmath23 , or new phenomena in the relevant kinematical region .",
    "the searches for gravity signals at the lhc are classified in terms of three different kinematical regions .",
    "_ cisplanckian region .",
    "_ this is the region in which the center - of - mass energy of the parton collision is smaller than the planck mass , @xmath346 .",
    "the theory can be described by an effective field - theory lagrangian with non - renormalizable interactions , and the seach for new contact interactions is an adequate experimental tool . however ,",
    "the relations between the coefficients of the contact interactions and the fundamental gravity parameters is model dependent . in this region ,",
    "the search for jet plus missing energy events is particularly interesting , because graviton emission can be reliably calculated with a perturbative expansion .",
    "the region  @xcite in which we can trust the effective theory for graviton emission is @xmath347  tev ( for @xmath116 ) or @xmath348  tev ( for @xmath349 ) .",
    "lhc is sensitive to the graviton signal up to @xmath350  tev ( for @xmath116 and an integrated luminosity @xmath351  fb@xmath352 ) or @xmath353  tev ( for @xmath349 and @xmath351  fb@xmath352 ) . in this window",
    ", lhc can perform a quantitative test of high - dimensional gravity in the cisplanckian region .",
    "_ planckian region .",
    "_ this is the intermediate region @xmath354 , where no experimental signals can be predicted without knowledge of the quantum - gravity theory .",
    "signals from graviton emissions or elastic gravitational scattering are also present , but their rates can not be reliably computed .",
    "new and unexpected phenomena will be the key to understand the underlying dynamics .",
    "of course this is the region which will eventually yield the crucial experimental information .",
    "_ transplanckian region .",
    "_ this is the region discussed in this paper , characterized by @xmath355 .",
    "the two experimental signals of interest in the transplanckian region are di - jet events ( from elastic parton scattering ) and black - hole production . unfortunately , in the case of the lhc we are rather limited in energy for both processes",
    ". the actual conditions for calculability we have taken are @xmath356 ( in which the transplanckian region extends up to about 1.8  tev ) or the more optimistic @xmath357 ( in which the transplanckian region extends up to about 3.5  tev ) . in both cases",
    "we are only marginally inside the transplanckian region since a complete separation between the quantum - gravity scale @xmath25 and the classical radius @xmath24 has not been fully reached . therefore quantum - gravity contributions can potentially modify in a significant way both elastic scattering and black - hole formation . in our analysis , we have assumed that such contributions are small .",
    "while the black - hole production cross section can only be estimated by dimensional analysis , the elastic cross section in the small - angle region can be computed as a perturbative expansion over controllable parameters .",
    "the elastic cross section is larger than the one for black - hole production .",
    "the observation of a cross section at finite angle growing with a power of @xmath157 would be a clean signal that the high - energy dynamics of gravity has been detected . given the highly characteristic events from black - hole evaporation , we expect negligible backgrounds for the black - hole events .",
    "as we have shown in this paper , the qcd background for di - jet events can be overcome by studying the distributions in di - jet invariant mass and rapidity separation .",
    "therefore , the di - jet signal from the gravitational deflection of partons is not limited by the background .",
    "its characteristic distributions can be used to test the gravitational nature of the interaction and to determine the parameters of the underlying theory .",
