    "this conjecture is false . for the shape @xmath22 shown in figure [ lambda ] , the inequality @xmath45 holds",

    "we present a proof of stanley s conjecture for @xmath53 .",
    "the author would like to thank prof .",
    "richard stanley for the inspiration and many helpful suggestions .",
    "our aim is to prove the following theorem .",
    "note that for rectangular shapes , conjectures [ conj1 ] and [ conj2 ] are equivalent , because for @xmath54 , the inequality @xmath55 holds .",
    "therefore , proving that @xmath56 has full rank is equivalent to proving that its rows are linearly independent .",
    "suppose for contradiction that there is a nontrivial linear combination of rows of @xmath56 equal to @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 be the coefficient of the row corresponding to a horizontal tableau @xmath33 in this combination .",
    "then for a column of @xmath56 labelled by a vertical tableau @xmath35 , the linear combination @xmath59 equals @xmath57 .",
    "alternatively , this sum can be written as @xmath60 .",
    "call a @xmath57-_filter _ a condition on horizontal tableax such that sum of @xmath58 over all @xmath33 satisfying this condition is @xmath57 .",
    "thus , orthogonality to @xmath35 is a @xmath57-filter .",
    "our aim is to show that being @xmath33 is a @xmath57-filter for every horizontal tableau @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , this is just saying that all @xmath58 are equal to @xmath57 , which contradicts the assumption above .    for @xmath61 ,",
    "a _ subtableau _ of shape @xmath62 of a vertical tableau @xmath35 of shape @xmath63 is a subset of @xmath64 columns of @xmath35 .",
    "a _ partial tableau _ is a collection of @xmath64 columns which is a subtableau of at least one vertical tableau @xmath35 .    in other words ,",
    "a partial tableau is a vertical tableau of shape @xmath62 , filled with numbers from @xmath65 .",
    "we can now generalize the concept of orthogonality as follows . call a horizontal tableau @xmath33 of shape @xmath63 orthogonal to a partial tableau @xmath66 of shape @xmath62 , where @xmath67 , if there exists vertical tableau @xmath35 of shape @xmath63 such that @xmath37 , and @xmath66 is a subtableau of @xmath35 .",
    "an example is presented in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the reason for considering such a generalization is evident from the following theorem .      for a given partial tableau @xmath66 of shape @xmath62 ,",
    "denote @xmath68 consider the sum @xmath69 .",
    "we claim that for each horizontal tableau @xmath33 , @xmath58 enters this sum with the same coefficient . indeed , the coefficient of a particular @xmath58 is the number of tableaux @xmath35 containing @xmath66 and orthogonal to @xmath33 .",
    "such @xmath35 s are in one - to - one correspondance with matchings between two sets of size @xmath70 , as can be seen from the figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the number of such matchings is @xmath71 , which obviously does not depend on particular @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 .",
    "since each @xmath73 is zero by the assumption above , the sum @xmath74 is also @xmath57 , which means that orthogonality to @xmath66 is a @xmath57-filter .",
    "we now continue the proof of theorem [ thm ] .",
    "choose a particular horizontal tableau @xmath75 , for example with one row filled with numbers @xmath76 and the other row filled with the rest of the numbers .",
    "if we show that @xmath77 , then in a similar fashion ( just by relabelling numbers ) we can show that all @xmath58 s are @xmath57 , which would be a contradiction with the assumption that the combination of rows of @xmath56 is nontrivial . for a given horizontal tableau @xmath33 ,",
    "let @xmath78 and @xmath79 be the numbers of elements of @xmath80 in the rows of @xmath33 , so that @xmath81 .",
    "we do not distinguish between the rows of @xmath33 , therefore we can assume that @xmath82 .",
    "observe that @xmath75 is the only horizontal tableau such that @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath84 be the collection of horizontal tableaux @xmath33 with @xmath85 , and call elements of @xmath84 _ horizontal tableaux of type _ @xmath86 . then @xmath75 is the only horizontal tableau of type @xmath51 .      for @xmath88 $ ] ,",
    "consider the set @xmath89 of all possible partial tableaux of shape @xmath62 , filled with numbers from @xmath80 .",
    "consider the sum @xmath90 .",
    "we claim that only @xmath58 s for @xmath33 of type at most @xmath91 appear in this sum .",
    "we also claim that the coefficient of @xmath58 in the sum depends only on the type of @xmath33 .",
    "the first statement is easy to verify .",
    "let @xmath33 be orthogonal to some @xmath92 .",
    "then each of the two rows of @xmath33 contains at least @xmath64 numbers from @xmath80 , which means it can not have type larger than @xmath70 . as for the second statement",
    ", we can calculate exactly the number of different @xmath92 that are orthogonal to a given @xmath33 of type @xmath86 .",
    "indeed , first choose an unordered @xmath64-tuple among the @xmath93 elements of @xmath80 in one row of @xmath33 .",
    "then match them with a ordered @xmath64-tuple taken from the @xmath86 elements of @xmath80 in the other row .",
    "obviously , such a procedure gives all possible @xmath66 , each exactly once .",
    "therefore , the coefficient of @xmath58 which we are looking for is @xmath94 .",
    "we now proceed by induction . for the base case ,",
    "take @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "the only horizontal tableaux in the sum @xmath90 are those of type @xmath96 $ ] . since they all have the same coefficient , and @xmath97 because each @xmath98",
    ", we conclude that @xmath99 } } \\tau_{\\mu } = 0 $ ] .    given",
    "that being a type @xmath86 tableau is a @xmath57-filter for @xmath96 \\leq a \\leq a ' < n$ ] , let us show that being a type @xmath100 tableau is a @xmath57-filter .",
    "indeed , @xmath101 as before . this equality can be written as @xmath102 \\leq a \\leq a'+1 } c_a^{n - a'-1 } \\sum_{\\mu \\in t_a } \\tau_{\\mu } = 0 $ ] , where @xmath103 is the coefficient calculated above . by the induction assumption , we know that for @xmath96 \\leq a \\leq a'$ ] , the sum @xmath104 is @xmath57 . since @xmath105 , we conclude that @xmath106 .",
    "a trivial observation to make is that for @xmath107 this theorem implies that @xmath77 , which leads to the desired contradiction .",
    "therefore , rows of @xmath56 are linearly independent , which proves theorem [ thm ] ."
