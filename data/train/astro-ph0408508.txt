    "recently , strong evidence has been presented that a sub - class of type iin supernovae ( sn ) ( ` n ' stands for narrow h@xmath2 ) includes rare sn  ia events exploding in a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) ( hamuy et al .",
    "2003 ) . to date , the new variety comprises three events : sn  2002ic , sn 1997cy and sn 1999e ( cf .",
    "deng et al .",
    "statistical arguments indicate that the new family constitutes less than one percent of all sn  ia ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) .",
    "all these supernovae remain very luminous after the light curve maximum , which is related to the cs interaction .",
    "a light curve model of sn  1997cy suggests that the cs envelope within @xmath3 cm contains several solar masses ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) .    two options for the origin of the csm have been proposed ( hamuy et al .",
    "2003 ) : mass - loss by a supergiant in a binary scenario of sn  ia ( whelan & iben 1973 ) or the mass - loss by a single supergiant in the sn1.5 scenario ( iben & renzini 1983 ) .",
    "the similarity of sn  2002ic events seems to favour the sn1.5 scenario , with the progenitor mass around @xmath4 ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) .",
    "the possible scenario of a c / o white dwarf ( wd ) merging with the co - core of a supergiant companion ( livio & riess 2003 ) faces a serious problem in explaining the short time lag between the ejection of the common envelope and the explosion ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) .    the study of the cs interaction and modeling of the spectra should elucidate the late evolution and the origin of these interesting events .",
    "an important recent conclusion is that sn  2002ic interacts with an equatorially concentrated csm ( deng et al .",
    "this statement is based upon the interpretation that line profiles in sn  2002ic are too broad compared with the predictions of a spherical model .",
    "also , spectropolarimetric observations of sn  2002ic reveal the presence of polarization which is likely to be related to the csm ( wang et al .",
    "the claimed asymmetry of the csm may have an important implication for the problem of the evolutionary scenario , because the single and binary scenarios are likely to possess different degrees of symmetry .",
    "the aspherical model predicts variations of the emission line profiles of sn  2002ic - like supernovae viewed from different angles .",
    "however , all three known objects ( see deng et al . 2004 , their fig .",
    "1 ) show similar shapes and widths of spectral features .",
    "this fact implies that , despite the detected polarization of the emission from sn  2002ic , the interaction possesses a high degree of sphericity . in view of this",
    ", we investigate a spherical model here .",
    "we attempt to explain the light curve , the ca  ii  line profiles and the quasi - continuum of sn  2002ic - like events on the basis of a circumstellar interaction model .",
    "we rely on the spherical approximation , although we allow for local deviations from sphericity ( e.g. clumpy structure ) .",
    "we start with the simulation of the cs interaction dynamics and the bolometric light curve of sn  2002ic using the thin shell approximation ( section 2 ) .",
    "although the model is the same as before ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) , we include more realistic ejecta abundances , which affects the light curve .",
    "we then analyse the line formation in the inhomogeneous intershock layer and propose a simple treatment of this problem ( section 3 ) . using this approximation",
    "we simulate the ca  ii  line profiles and the quasi - continuum of sn  2002ic with the kinematic parameters of the interaction model .",
    "we demonstrate that the spherical model successfully accounts for the basic observational properties of sn  2002ic and discuss implications .",
    "the interaction of a sn  ia with a dense spherical cs envelope and the light curve formation is calculated using the model applied earlier for the analysis of the cs interaction of sn  2002ic ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) .",
    "we recapitulate the basic assumptions of the model and emphasize some modifications .",
    "the density distribution in a freely expanding sn  ia ejecta ( @xmath5 ) is approximated by the exponential law @xmath6 with @xmath7 determined by the the mass @xmath8 and kinetic energy @xmath9 .",
    "an exponential law better represents the density distribution in sn  ia ejecta than a power law ( dwarkadas & chevalier 1998 ) . in an attempt to provide the maximum expansion velocity of the interaction shell we consider a sn  ia model with the maximum kinetic energy , corresponding to the detonation model det1 of khokhlov et al .",
    "( 1993 ) : @xmath10 erg with the @xmath11ni mass of @xmath12 .",
    "we do not claim that the det1 detonation regime actually occurs in sn  2002ic .",
    "this model strongly underproduces intermediate mass elements ( e.g. ca ) ( khokhlov et al . 1993 ) , which is at odds with the strong ca  ii  lines observed in sn  2002ic ( see below sec .",
    ". parameters of the det1 model are adopted because this case illustrates what happens if all of a chandrasekhar mass c / o wd is burned .",
    "the important point here is that the complete incineration of c and o is not required : if the burning in the outer layers is terminated at the intermediate elements , the released nuclear energy is practically the same as in the case of complete incineration .",
    "the cs density distribution is described by power laws ( @xmath13 ) with different power law indices for each of three suggested radial zones : @xmath14 in the range @xmath15 , @xmath16 for @xmath17 , and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the variation of the power law index is suggested by two observations : ( i ) the luminosity decline after about day 400 ( deng et al .",
    "2004 ) suggests a cs density drop beyond some radius @xmath19 ; ( ii ) the rising early visual luminosity of sn  2002ic ( wood - vasey et al .",
    "2002 ; hamuy et al .",
    "2003 ) suggests a flat ( or rising outwards ) cs density distribution in the inner part ( @xmath15 ) of the cs envelope ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic interaction is calculated in the thin shell approximation , in which the layer between the forward and reverse shocks is replaced by a geometrically thin shell ( chevalier 1982b ) .",
    "the kinetic luminosities of the forward and reverse shock waves are converted into x - ray luminosities using transformation coefficients dependent on cooling rates of the postshock gas and the expansion time ( chugai 1992 ; chevalier & fransson 1994 ) . for the cs density range of interest , the reverse shock is always radiative , which leads to the formation of a cool dense shell ( cds ) composed of the shocked sn ejecta .",
    "the forward shock can be also radiative and contribute to the cds formation .",
    "the x - ray radiation of both shocks absorbed by the cool material ( sn ejecta , cds , and csm ) is identified with the optical bolometric luminosity powered by the cs interaction .",
    "the additional luminosity powered by the radioactive decay @xmath11ni  @xmath11co ",
    "@xmath11fe is calculated using an analytical theory for the sn light curve ( arnett 1980 ) .",
    "the resulting light curve is the sum of the interaction and radioactive luminosities .",
    "an important modification in the present version is the inclusion of a ` realistic ' chemical composition of the sn  ia ejecta instead of the previously assumed solar composition ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) .",
    "the sn  ia composition is now approximated by a mixture of fe and si , where the amount of fe is equal to the ejected @xmath11ni mass .",
    "the new composition results in more efficient cooling in the reverse shock and more efficient absorption of the x - rays in the sn ejecta .",
    "the adopted absorption coefficient for x - rays in the sn material is @xmath20",
    "@xmath21 g@xmath22 , i.e. , 50 times larger than that with a solar composition . owing to the efficient absorption of x - rays in the sn  ia ejecta with the ` realistic ' composition , the rate of emission of optical photons per unit of kinetic luminosity is higher in the present model compared with the earlier version .",
    "our modeling of the bolometric optical light curve is compared with the sn  2002ic data from deng et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , modified here for a hubble constant of @xmath23 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 .",
    "two versions of the light curve computations along with the corresponding shell radius and velocity are presented in fig .",
    "[ f - blc ] . fig .",
    "[ f - blc]a shows the model with @xmath24 , whereas the second model ( panel _ b _ ) corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "both cs density distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - rho ] . the model with @xmath25",
    "provides the largest expansion velocities of the thin shell ( @xmath26 ) and of the sn at the boundary ( @xmath27 ) . from the point of view of the interpretation of the observed broad line profiles ,",
    "this model is preferred .",
    "henceforth , this case is referred to as the standard model .",
    "the flatter cs density distribution of the model compared with a steady - state wind implies that after the main mass loss episode , the mass loss rate gradually decreased while the presupernova evolved towards the explosion .",
    "the total mass of the cs envelope in the standard model is @xmath28 .",
    "this estimate should be considered a lower limit , because we neglect the possible wind at @xmath29 that may comprise a significant mass , despite its lower density . if the wind velocity out to @xmath30 cm is @xmath31 km s@xmath22 , then the age of the strong mass loss is @xmath32 yr and the mass loss rate is @xmath33 yr@xmath22 .",
    "we recalculated the light curve of sn  1997cy for the detonation model with a ` realistic ' composition and found that the mass of the cs envelope in this case is @xmath34 , a factor two lower than our previous estimate for sn  1997cy based upon a model with lower explosion energy and normal composition of the sn ejecta ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) .",
    "most of the difference is related to the efficient conversion of the kinetic luminosity into the bolometric luminosity owing to the efficient absorption of x - rays by the ejecta .",
    "the model of the optical light curve predicts the luminosity and flux of the escaping x - rays , which may be used as an additional test of the model for sn  2002ic - like events . in fig .",
    "[ f - xlc ] , we plot the total luminosity of the escaping x - rays from the forward and reverse shocks , together with the temperatures of both shocks for the standard model . due to the high cs density and rather flat cs density distribution ,",
    "the velocity jump at the inner shock is relatively high ( fig.[f - blc ] ) .",
    "this , combined with the higher molecular weight of the sn  ia matter , results in a high temperature of the reverse shock that is comparable to the temperature of the forward shock after day 250 . in a sn",
    "ii interacting with a wind , the reverse shock is usually markedly slower and cooler than the forward shock ( chevalier 1982b ) .",
    "remarkably , the luminosity of the forward shock is large and provides a substantial contribution to the optical sn luminosity .",
    "this is due to the fact that the forward shock is radiative : it enters the fully radiative regime on day @xmath35 .",
    "the reverse shock is radiative through the time period we have modeled .",
    "the inflection in the forward shock luminosity on day @xmath36 reflects the corresponding inflection in the adopted cs density distribution at @xmath37 cm ( fig .",
    "[ f - rho ] ) .",
    "the forward shock becomes nonradiative soon after that point , at @xmath38 d.    the photon spectrum of the emergent x - ray flux at different epochs between day 30 and day 600 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - xfc ] together with the detection limit of the jem - x monitor of the integral satellite assuming a 3@xmath39 detection level with the integration time of @xmath40 s ( http://astro.estec.esa.nl/integral/ ) .",
    "the plot demonstrates that the detection of x - rays from sn  2002ic is not expected in our model for a reasonable integration time . on the other hand , a sn  2002ic - like event exploding at a distance @xmath41 mpc would be detectable at the favorable epoch of 200400 days by the jem - x monitor with an integration time @xmath42 s. chandra and xmm may be even more efficient in detecting the x - rays from distant sn  2002ic - like events . between days",
    "@xmath43 the predicted flux of sn  2002ic in the @xmath44 kev band is @xmath45 erg s@xmath22 @xmath46 . given the chandra detection limit @xmath47 erg s@xmath22 @xmath46 in the @xmath44 kev band , we conclude that x - rays from sn  2002ic could have been detected at an age @xmath43 days . at later epochs ,",
    "the flux quickly decreases ( fig .",
    "[ f - xfc ] ) and on day 600 it becomes far below the chandra sensitivity .",
    "the above model for the escaping x - ray flux assumes a smooth csm .",
    "clumpiness may modify these results in two ways : a different temperature in the forward shock , and a different escape probability for photons through the clumpy csm .",
    "the late time subaru spectrum on day @xmath48 ( assuming the explosion date jd 2452585 ) consists of broad emission bumps ( we dub them quasi - continuum ) with superimposed emission lines of h@xmath2 , h@xmath49 , ca  ii  3900  , and ca  ii  8600   blended with o  i  8446   ( deng et al .",
    "most of the bolometric luminosity in our dynamical model comes from the shocked ejecta .",
    "we , therefore , believe that , apart from h@xmath2  and h@xmath49  and other narrow lines , most of the optical spectrum on day 234 ( i.e. quasi - continuum and ca  ii  lines ) originates from shocked sn ejecta . this conjecture will be checked below .",
    "we only briefly address the important issue of h@xmath2  line formation .",
    "although the cs origin of the narrow h@xmath2  emission is certain , the nature of the broad h@xmath2  is unclear .",
    "multiple thomson scattering as a mechanism for the broad h@xmath2 , applied earlier to sn  1998s ( chugai 2001 ) , and discussed by wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in connection with sn  2002ic , requires a large optical depth @xmath50 .",
    "this is in conflict with our dynamical model that predicts a thomson optical depth of the undisturbed cs ejecta of @xmath51 on day @xmath52 . in our opinion ,",
    "the broad h@xmath2  comes from the shocked cool dense hydrogen .",
    "there are three possible origins for that line - emitting gas : ( i ) the outer layers of the sn ejecta may contain the remains of the hydrogen envelope of the presupernova ( in the sn  1.5 scenario ) , so the cool shocked ejecta enriched by hydrogen may be partially responsible for the broad h@xmath2  component ; ( ii ) the forward shock becomes radiative in the case of smooth cs hydrogen after about day 150 , so the shocked cs hydrogen cools at that epoch and becomes able to emit broad h@xmath2 ; ( iii ) in the case of a clumpy cs envelope radiative shocks in cs clouds and the shear flow around the shocked clouds may produce the broad velocity spectrum of the line - emitting gas that can be responsible for the intermediate and broad h@xmath2  line . in reality , all three sources of the cool shocked hydrogen may contribute to the broad h@xmath2  component .",
    "however , only in the third option can the observed intermediate h@xmath2component with a width of @xmath53 km s@xmath22 ( hamuy et al .",
    "2003 ) be produced .    henceforth , we concentrate on the study of the ca  ii  emission lines and the quasi - continuum .",
    "momentum and mass conservation imply a very small thickness of the cds , of the order of @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the velocity of the reverse shock and @xmath56 is the ion sound speed in the cool gas . with @xmath57 km s@xmath22 at an age of 230 - 250 d ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , adopting the temperature of the cool gas of @xmath58  k and the ion average atomic weight @xmath59 ( i.e. , @xmath60 km s@xmath22 ) , @xmath61 . for such a thin shell",
    "the velocity dispersion along the line of sight is negligible , so the line radiation transfer in this shell may be treated in the static approximation ( chevalier and fransson 1994 ) .",
    "the expansion effect appears only in the transformation of the shell emission to the observer frame .",
    "however , the picture of a spherical thin cds is an idealization ; in reality , as we will show below , the shell should be strongly distorted .",
    "a straightforward argument against the existence of a geometrically thin spherical shell is based upon the observed profiles of the ca  ii  features .",
    "it is well known that in the optically thin case the line profile from a geometrically thin expanding shell should be boxy .",
    "this might be a sensible approximation for the observed ca  ii  features given some unavoidable perturbation and smearing of the boxy profile .",
    "the problem , however , is that the ca  ii  lines are expected to be optically thick , not thin .    to show that the dense shell is opaque in the ca",
    "ii  lines , we consider the conditions on day 240 . the swept up sn mass in the reverse shock in the standard model is @xmath62 and the shell radius is @xmath63 cm . assuming that the swept up mass resides in the cds and that the ca abundance among fe - peak elements is solar , i.e. , @xmath64 by mass ( a sensible approximation for a rough estimate ) one gets the column density of ca  ii  in the cds of @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is the ionization fraction of ca  ii ) .",
    "the optical depth in the ca  iidoublet lines is then @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the oscillator strength for the ca  ii  doublet and @xmath69 km s@xmath22 is the thermal velocity assuming @xmath70  k. on day 234 , the number density in the cds under pressure equilibrium is @xmath71 @xmath72 .",
    "assuming lte in the cool dense gas we obtain @xmath73 for @xmath74 k. the equation ( [ eq - tauca ] ) shows that the optical depth of the cds in the ca  ii  doublet is very large for the estimated ca  ii  ionization fraction .",
    "it is easy to check that , given the low excitation potential of the ca  ii  term @xmath75d , the ca  ii  triplet should be optically thick too .",
    "optically thick ca  ii  lines from a geometrically thin shell are expected to be double - horned ( m - shaped ) @xmath76 with peaks at the shell velocity ( @xmath77 ) ( gerasimovic 1933 ) .",
    "this type of profile is apparently inconsistent with the smooth , round - topped ( flat - topped ) ca  ii  doublet and triplet profiles observed in sn  2002ic ( see deng et al .",
    "2004 ) . to resolve this controversy",
    ", we follow cid fernandes & terlevich ( 1994 ) in suggesting that the round - topped h@xmath2  line profile observed in sne  ii interacting with a dense cs environment are produced by a thin shell corrugated due to the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability .",
    "it is well known that the decelerated thin shell in the intershock layer is subject to the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability ( chevalier 1982a ; nadyozhin 1985 ) .",
    "rt spikes grow and degrade via shearing and advective flows , thus producing a two - fluid mixture consisting of dense cool gas and hot postshock gas behind the forward shock wave . as a result , a mixing layer with an extent @xmath78 forms between the thin shell and the forward shock as demonstrated by 2d and 3d simulations ( chevalier & blondin 1995 ; blondin & ellison 2001 ) .",
    "the clumpy structure of the csm may cause additional perturbations of the mixing layer and lead to the corrugation of the forward and reverse shocks ( blondin 2001 , his fig .",
    "if both reverse and forward shocks are radiative , the shell instability becomes even more vigorous due to the nonlinear thin shell instability ( blondin & marks 1996 ; hueckstaedt 2003 ) .",
    "the above arguments based upon the profile shape and the interaction hydrodynamics suggest that a realistic model of the intershock line - emitting layer should include the inhomogeneous distribution of the dense shocked gas .    to treat the line formation in the inhomogeneous intershock layer , we reduce it to a spherical ` shell ' of a thickness @xmath79 in the range of radii @xmath80 filled with similar , randomly oriented , dense planar fragments ( fig . [ f - cart ] ) . each fragment is a thin sheet with an area @xmath39 and total surface area @xmath81 . as a result of the deformation and stretching of dense fragments , their cumulative area @xmath82",
    "should , generally , exceed the area of the unperturbed spherical dense shell @xmath83 by a factor @xmath84 . as we will see below , this parameter ( called the ` area ratio ' ) turns out to be crucial for the interpretation of the high luminosity of the ca  ii  features in sn  2002ic .",
    "moreover , the high luminosity of the ca  ii  features requires @xmath85 .",
    "this is the reason why we omit in our simple model ( fig .",
    "[ f - cart ] ) the thin spherical shell that is produced and destroyed continuously in the reverse shock .",
    "we consider two plausible velocity distributions of filaments in the shell @xmath86 : a constant velocity and a linear law @xmath87 .",
    "line photons emitted by randomly distributed dense fragments may escape or be absorbed by another fragment of the shell . to describe the line radiative transfer inside the inhomogeneous shell we apply the local escape probability language adapted for the ` gas ' of opaque macroscopic chunks of dense material .",
    "definitions of the local optical depth and emissivity must be modified accordingly .",
    "the total number of fragments in the shell is @xmath88 and the fragment number density is @xmath89 , where @xmath90 .",
    "the average cross - section of a fragment is @xmath91 with the ratio @xmath92 for plane sheets and @xmath93 for deformed sheets .",
    "for instance , for a cylindrical surface with a radius @xmath94 and a height @xmath95 this ratio is @xmath96 with the accuracy of @xmath97 .",

    "the analog of the sobolev optical depth in our case is the local occultation optical depth , @xmath104 . to take into account the finite optical depth of a fragment this expression should be multiplied by the absorption probability of a fragment @xmath105 . for a shell with constant velocity , the velocity gradient along some direction is @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the angle between the photon wave vector and the radius .",

    "actually , for large @xmath111 one gets @xmath132 so @xmath133 becomes independent of @xmath131 .",
    "remarkably , the line luminosity according to equation ( [ eq - lumir ] ) exceeds the upper limit on the luminosity of a static shell by a factor @xmath134 that , for large area ratio , may be substantially greater than unity . this apparent paradox is related to the velocity gradient that permits the volume emission regime for resonance photons as opposed to the surface emission regime in the static case .",

    "however , we compute the line profiles on the assumption of zero albedo , which , as we checked , does not affect the profile significantly .    in the limit of a small area ratio ( @xmath137 ) the luminosity of the ca  ii  triplet on day 234 for the probable temperature range @xmath138  k for @xmath139 is @xmath140 erg s@xmath22 . on the other hand , using the flux in the 8500   band , @xmath141 erg s@xmath22 cm@xmath22 on day 234 ( deng et al . 2004 ) , we find the luminosity @xmath143 erg s@xmath22 which significantly exceeds the upper limit found for @xmath144 .",
    "this means that either @xmath145 or the emission feature at 8500   is dominated by o  i  8446   as deng at al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest .",
    "below we will see that the contribution of the o  i  8446   line is small so the high luminosity of the ca  ii  triplet is primarily due to the large area ratio .    to show the effect of @xmath111 we consider the transparent case @xmath146 and modestly opaque shell @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",

    "the profile is parabolic with a weak asymmetry due to relativistic effects .",
    "the relativistic effects arising from the lorentz transformation of the frequency , wave vector and intensity are usually ignored in sn spectrum calculations .",
    "however as was demonstrated by jeffery ( 1993 ) these effects become noticeable even for expansion velocities of @xmath151 km s@xmath22 and generally result in the skewing of an emission component towards blue .",
    "although the contribution of the net emission from the unshocked sn ejecta is small for sn2002ic given the domination of the shock luminosity , the sn ejecta can affect the line profile via the scattering of line photon emitted by the cds .",

    "we adopt @xmath233 and a ca abundance 0.03 , which is close to the admissible lower limit ( @xmath234 ) and is consistent with the mass and composition of the fe - poor ca - rich layer produced by the delayed detonation model ( iwamoto et al .",

    "modeling of the spectra of the fragmented cool dense shell formed in the intershock layer provides strong evidence that the quasi - continuum and ca  ii  lines are emitted by different zones .",

    "the fe - poor ejecta are shocked earlier and , therefore , spread throughout the intershock layer , while fe - rich ejecta are shocked later and thus have not yet mixed with the fe - poor material at @xmath245 d. this picture predicts that at a later epoch ( @xmath246 d ) both fe - poor and fe - rich shocked components should be mixed with each other . as a result ,",

    "the high luminosity of the ca  ii  doublet and triplet in sn  2002ic on day 234 indicates that the dense shocked ejecta form a structure with a large area ratio , @xmath247 . a high area ratio ( @xmath248 ) is also preferred by the quasi - continuum model . the area ratio , which is common in the treatment of the physics of mixing fluids ( e.g. , catrakis et al . 2002 ) , has not been used before in the interpretation of optically thick emission lines from an intershock layer .",
    "it was recognized earlier that the interpretation of the x - ray and radio emission of an interacting sn depends on the presence of a mixing layer , while the h@xmath2  emitted by the mixed dense material may reveal the fine structure related to the rt spikes ( chevalier & blondin 1995 ) . here",
    "we add to the list of effects of the mixing layer the crucial role of the large area ratio for the interpretation of the ca  ii  lines and quasi - continuum in sn  2002ic .",
    "the fact that the area ratio in sn  2002ic on day 234 is large , @xmath1 , suggests that we observe an advanced stage of the mixing of dense shocked ejecta in the intershock zone .",

    "we know three events of sne  ia in a dense csm ( sn  1997cy , sn  1999e , sn  2002ic ) and they show similar widths and shapes of spectral features at a similar phase ( see deng et al .",

    "this fact suggests that a bi - polar structure of the sn / csm interface with high aspect ratio is unlikely .    at first glance",
    "the picture of spherical interaction is incompatible with the detection of intrinsic polarization of sn  2002ic radiation at a level of @xmath265 % ( wang et al .",
    "simple estimates show that the thomson scattering in a moderately aspherical cs envelope with @xmath51 is not able to produce such a high polarization .",
    "the issue may be resolved in a model in which the polarization is acquired in the scattering of the sn radiation on the dust in a distant ( @xmath266 cm ) aspherical csm .    the resemblance of the light curves for all three sn  2002ic - like events ( see deng et al .",
    "2004 ) suggests a similar regime of mass - loss from their presupernovae and a common origin of the progenitors .",
    "as mentioned before ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) , the uniformity lends support for the sn1.5 evolutionary scenario suggested by iben & renzini ( 1983 ) .",

    "there is no clear reason for the supergiant to have experienced strong mass loss just before the sn explosion .",
    "the synchronization of the vigorous mass loss and the sn event might be a more natural outcome in the single agb star scenario with the c / o core approaching the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "a general belief is that chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs can not be produced from intermediate - mass single stars because the growth of the c / o core during the thermal pulsation stage is prevented by the removal of the hydrogen envelope ( blcker 1995 , and references therein ) . in this regard ,",
    "it is highly remarkable that at least two supernovae ( sn  2002ic and sn  1997cy ) exploded in dwarf galaxies , as already noted by chugai & yungelson ( 2004 ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies are characterized by low metallicity , which thus might explain why the co core of an asymptotic giant branch star is successful in attaining the chandrasekhar limit before the hydrogen envelope is lost ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) .",
    "an evidence for the low metallicity of the presupernova of sn  2002ic comes from our modelling of the ca  ii  lines and quasi - continuum ( sec .",
    "[ sec - cont ] ) .",
    "the possibility of sn1.5 explosions in metal - poor galaxies was suggested also by zijlstra ( 2004 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether all the host galaxies of sn  2002ic - like supernovae are actually metal deficient .",
    "if the suggested link between sn  2002ic - like events and low metallicity is correct , then their occurrence rate relative to normal sn  ia must increase with the redshift for @xmath270 , when the average cosmic metallicity was lower than solar .",
    "if sn  2002ic - like events stem from sn  1.5 explosions , their low fraction of sn  ia , @xmath271% , can be used to estimate the the fraction of white dwarfs created with a mass similar to the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "if only @xmath272% of all wds can become sn  ia , this suggests that only @xmath273 of white dwarfs in our galaxy were formed with a mass close to the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "since these white dwarfs are likely to have formed in a metal poor environment , they are probably very old ( age @xmath274 yr ) and thus of low luminosity , @xmath275 ( prada moroni & straniero 2003 ) .",
    "the number of known cool white dwarfs is low , @xmath276 ( salim et al .",
    "2004 ) , and will probably remain too low for the nearest future to test the idea whether high mass white dwarfs were produced during early epochs when the metallicity was low .",
    "the possible link between sn  2002ic - like supernovae and hypothetical sn1.5 events , combined with arguments in favour of a high energy sn  ia event in this case , raises the question of whether conditions in a hot chandrasekhar mass c / o wd that just got rid of the remnants of the hydrogen envelope favour a wd explosion with a high kinetic energy of ejecta .",
    "the sn1.5 origin of sn  2002ic suggests that the initial mass at the main sequence is @xmath277 . with the chandrasekhar core and @xmath28 in the dense cs envelope",
    "we expect that about @xmath278 had to be lost at the previous agb stage .",
    "this means that outside the dense cs envelope ( @xmath279 cm ) there should be a dense red supergiant wind with a velocity of the order @xmath280 km s@xmath22 and a mass loss rate of @xmath281 yr@xmath22 . keeping in mind the analogy with sn  1979c",
    ", this wind may be revealed in the infrared ( ir ) as an ir echo ( dwek 1983 ) , and in the radio as a result of cs interaction ( chevalier 1982a , weiler et al .",
    "however , the radio emission from the distant sn  2002ic ( @xmath282 mpc ) may pose a difficult challenge to detect . if the radio luminosity is comparable to that of sn  1979c ( weiler et al .",
    "1986 ) then the expected radio flux from sn  2002ic around 1000 day should be of the order of @xmath283 mjy in the @xmath284 cm band , which is close to the detection limit of vla . a more promising target for the detection of the late time interaction of",
    "sn  2002ic - like supernovae with the presumed agb wind is sn  1999e at a distance of @xmath285 mpc , or any closer sn  2002ic - like event that will be discovered in the future .",
    "note , that at the epoch of the interaction with the dense cs shell ( @xmath286 d ) , the radio emission is severely attenuated by free - free absorption at wavelengths @xmath287 cm . with the parameters used in our models , and adopting temperatures for the shell and wind in accordance with the models of lundqvist & fransson ( 1988 ) , we find that free - free absorption is a likely reason why the observations of berger & soderberg ( 2003 ) and stockdale et al .",
    "( 2003 ) did not detect radio emission from sn  2002ic .",
    "a better understanding of the phenomenon of sn  2002ic - like events requires an accurate energy audit , for which the direct detection of the x - ray emission as well as ir measurements are important .",
    "sn  2002ic - like events at an age of @xmath43 days are excellent targets for chandra , xmm and integral .",
    "we are grateful to lifan wang for sharing his spectrum of sn  2002ic and tanya ryabchikova for the help in retrieving the line list from vald .",
