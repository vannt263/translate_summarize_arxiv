    "one of the main goal of the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions is to study the deconfined matter , known as quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) , which is expected to form at large densities .",
    "it has been suggested that the transition from hadronic to qgp state can be treated by percolation theory @xcite .",
    "the formulation of percolation problem is concerned with elementary geometrical objects placed on a random d - dimensional lattice .",
    "the objects have a well defined connectivity radius @xmath0 , and two objects can communicate if the distance between them is less than @xmath0 .",
    "several objects can form a cluster of communication . at certain density of the objects a infinite cluster appears which spans the entire system .",
    "this is defined by the dimensionless percolation parameter @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "percolation theory has been applied to several areas ranging from clustering in spin system to the formation of galaxies .",
    "figure 1 shows the transition from disconnected to connected system at high densities .    in nuclear collisions",
    "there is indeed , as a function of parton density , a sudden onset of large scale color connection .",
    "there is a critical density at which the elemental objects form one large cluster , loosing their independent existence .",
    "percolation would correspond to the onset of color deconfinement and it may be a prerequisite for any subsequent qgp formation .",
    "the determination of the eos of hot , strongly interacting matter is one of the main challenges of strong interaction physics ( hotqcd collaboration ) @xcite .",
    "recent lqcd calculations for the bulk thermodynamic observables , e.g. pressure , energy density , entropy density and for the sound velocity have been reported @xcite .",
    "a percolation model coupled with hydrodynamics has been utilized to calculate these quantities from the star data at rhic energies in central au+au collisions .",
    "multiparticle production at high energies is currently described in terms of color strings stretched between the projectile and target . hadronizing these strings",
    "produce the observed hadrons .",
    "the strings act as color sources of particles through the creation of @xmath2 pairs from the sea .",
    "the number of strings grows with the energy and with the number of nucleons of participating nuclei .",
    "color strings may be viewed as small discs in the transverse space filled with the color field created by colliding partons .",
    "particles are produced by the schwinger mechanisms @xcite . with growing energy and size of the colliding nuclei the number of strings grow and start to overlap to form clusters @xcite . at a critical density",
    "a macroscopic cluster appears that marks the percolation phase transition .",
    "2d percolation is a non - thermal second order phase transition , but in cspm the schwinger barrier penetration mechanism for particle production and the fluctuations in the associated string tension due to the strong string interactions make it possible to define a temperature . consequently the particle spectrum is `` born '' with a thermal distribution @xcite .",
    "the percolation threshold at which the spanning cluster appear , a `` connected '' system of color sources , identifies the percolation phase transition .    with an increasing number of strings",
    "there is a progression from isolated individual strings to clusters and then to a large cluster which suddenly spans the area . in two dimensional percolation theory",
    "the relevant quantity is the dimensionless percolation density parameter given by @xcite @xmath3 where n is the number of strings formed in the collisions and @xmath4 is the transverse area of the single string and @xmath5 is the transverse nuclear overlap area .",
    "the critical cluster which spans @xmath5 , appears for @xmath6 1.2 @xcite . as @xmath1 increases the fraction of @xmath5 covered by this spanning cluster increases .",
    "the percolation theory governs the geometrical pattern of string clustering .",
    "it requires some dynamics to describe the interaction of several overlapping strings .",
    "it is assumed that a cluster behaves as a single string with a higher color field corresponding to the vectorial sum of the color charge of each individual string . knowing the color charge",
    ", one can calculate the multiplicity @xmath7 and the mean transverse momentum @xmath8 of the particles produced by a cluster of strings .",
    "one finds @xcite    @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mean multiplicity and average transverse momentum squared of particles produced by a single string with a transverse area @xmath13 . in the saturation limit",
    ", all the strings overlap into a single cluster that approximately occupies the whole interaction area , one gets the following universal scaling law    @xmath14    this scaling law shows a reasonable agreement with all the experimental data for all projectiles , targets and energies @xcite . in the limit of high density one obtains @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the color suppression factor .",
    "it follows that @xmath17 a similar scaling is found in the color glass condensate approach ( cgc)@xcite .",
    "the saturation scale @xmath18 in cgc corresponds to @xmath19 in cspm .",
    "the net effect due to @xmath20 is the reduction in hadron multiplicity and increase in the average transverse momentum of particles .",
    "the cspm model calculation for hadron multiplicities and momentum spectra was found to be in excellent agreement with experiment @xcite . within the framework of clustering of color sources , the elliptic flow , @xmath21 , and the dependence of the nuclear modification factor on the azimuthal angle show reasonable agreement with the rhic data @xcite",
    ". the critical density of percolation is related to the effective critical temperature and thus percolation may be the way to achieve deconfinement in the heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "an additional important check of this interacting string approach was provided by the measurement of long range forward backward multiplicity correlations ( lrc ) by the star group at rhic @xcite .",
    "to obtain the value of @xmath1 from data , a parameterization of p - p events at 200 gev is used to compute the @xmath22 distribution @xcite    @xmath23    where a , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are parameters used to fit the data .",
    "this parameterization also can be used for nucleus - nucleus collisions to take into account the interactions of the strings@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 corresponds to the area occupied by the n overlapping strings .",
    "the thermodynamic limit , i.e. letting n and @xmath27 @xmath28 while keeping @xmath1 fixed , is used to evaluate @xmath20 given by eq.(5 ) . for nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "eq.(8 ) becomes    @xmath29    in pp collisions @xmath30 @xmath31 1 due to the low string overlap probability .",
    "the star analysis of charged hadrons had presented the preliminary results for the percolation density parameter , @xmath1 at rhic for several collisions systems as a function of centrality@xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath1 as function of the number of participant nucleons(@xmath32 ) in au+au collisions at @xmath33 200 and 62.4 gev .",
    "these experimental @xmath1 values are used to get the bulk thermodynamic observables .",
    "the strong longitudinal chromo - electric fields produce schwinger - bialas @xcite like radiation with a thermal spectrum , in analogy with the hawking - unruh radiation @xcite .",
    "both the schwinger - bialas and hawking - unruh derivations lead to the same value of the maximum entropy temperature . above the critical value of @xmath1 , the qgp in cspm consists of massless constituents ( gluons ) .",
    "the percolation density parameter @xmath1 determines the cluster size distribution , the temperature t(@xmath1 ) and the transverse momentum in the collision @xcite .",
    "the connection between @xmath1 and the temperature @xmath34 involves the schwinger mechanism ( sm ) for particle production . in cspm the schwinger distribution for massless particles is expressed in terms of @xmath35 @xmath36 with the average value of string tension @xmath37 .",
    "gaussian fluctuations in the string tension around its mean value transforms sm into the thermal distribution @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath37 = @xmath39 . the temperature is given by @xmath40 the string percolation density parameter @xmath1 which characterizes the percolation clusters also determines the temperature of the system . in this way at @xmath41=1.2 the percolation phase transition at @xmath42 models the thermal deconfinement transition .",
    "in the determination of temperature using eq.(13 ) the value of @xmath20 is obtained using the experimental data @xcite .",
    "we will adopt the point of view that the experimentally determined chemical freeze - out temperature is a good measure of the phase transition temperature , @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the single string average transverse momentum @xmath44 is calculated at @xmath41 = 1.2 with the universal chemical freeze - out temperature of 167.7 @xmath45 2.6 mev @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath46 = 207.2 @xmath45 3.3 mev which is close to @xmath47200 mev used previously in the calculation of the percolation transition temperature @xcite . above @xmath41 = 1.2 the size and density of the spanning cluster increases .",
    "we use the measured value of @xmath1 = 2.88 to determine the temperature , before the expansion , @xmath48 = 193.6@xmath453.0 mev of the quark gluon plasma in reasonable agreement with @xmath48 = 221@xmath49 from the enhanced direct photon experiment measured by the phenix collaboration@xcite .",
    "among the most important and fundamental problems in finite - temperature qcd are the calculation of the bulk properties of hot qcd matter and characterization of the nature of the qcd phase transition .",
    "the qgp according to cspm is born in local thermal equilibrium because the temperature is determined at the string level .",
    "we use cspm coupled to hydrodynamics to calculate energy density , pressure , entropy density and sound velocity . as mentioned earlier the strings",
    "interact strongly to form clusters and produce the pressure at the early stages of the collisions , which is evident from the presence of elliptical flow in cspm @xcite .",
    "after the initial temperature @xmath50 the cspm perfect fluid may expand according to bjorken boost invariant 1d hydrodynamics @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the energy density , s the entropy density , @xmath53 the proper time , and @xmath54 the sound velocity . above the critical temperature only massless particles are present in cspm .",
    "the initial energy density @xmath55 above @xmath43 is given by @xcite @xmath56 to evaluate @xmath55 we use the charged pion multiplicity @xmath57 at midrapidity and @xmath27 values from star for 0 - 10% central au - au collisions with @xmath33200 gev @xcite .",
    "the factor 3/2 in eq.(19 ) accounts for the neutral pions .",
    "the dynamics of massless particle production has been studied in qe2 quantum electrodynamics .",
    "qe2 can be scaled from electrodynamics to quantum chromodynamics using the ratio of the coupling constants @xcite .",
    "the production time @xmath58 for a boson ( gluon ) is @xcite @xmath59 in cspm the total transverse energy is proportional to @xmath1 . from the measured value of @xmath1 and @xmath52",
    "it is found that @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath1 for the range @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xmath1 gev/@xmath62 @xcite .",
    "this relationship has been extrapolated to below @xmath63 and above @xmath64 for the energy and entropy density calculations .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath65 as obtained from cspm along with the lqcd calculations @xcite and the cspm pressure @xmath66 .",
    "for an ideal gas of massless constituents , the energy density and pressure are related by @xmath67 . in lqcd",
    "the basic quantity is the interaction measure @xmath68 , which is also known as the trace anomaly . in",
    "cspm @xmath69 reaches zero for t @xmath70 while in case of lqcd it is strongly interacting even for t @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the sound velocity requires the evaluation of s and @xmath72 , which can be expressed in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath20 . with @xmath73 = @xmath20",
    "one obtains :    @xmath74    then @xmath75 becomes : @xmath76 for @xmath77 , an analytic function of @xmath1 for the equation of state of the qgp for t @xmath78 .",
    "figure 4 shows the comparison of @xmath75 from cspm and lqcd .",
    "the lqcd values were obtained using the eos of 2 + 1 flavor qcd at finite temperature with physical strange quark mass and almost physical light quark masses @xcite . at @xmath79=1",
    "the cspm and lqcd agree with the @xmath75 value of the physical hadron gas with resonance mass truncation m @xmath80 2.5 gev @xcite",
    ".    the entropy density @xmath81 is obtained from energy density and speed of sound as shown in fig.5 along with the lqcd results .",
    "cspm is in excellent agreement with the lqcd calculations in the phase transition region for @xmath821.5 .",
    "the percolation analysis of the color sources applied to star data at rhic provides a compelling argument that the qgp is formed in central au - au collisions at @xmath33 200 gev .",
    "it also suggests that the qgp is produced in all soft high energy high multiplicity collisions when the string density exceeds the percolation transition .",
    "the results are also in agreement with lattice qcd in the phase transition region , when the results are plotted with respect to @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the value of @xmath75=0.14 is in agreement with the physical resonance gas value at the critical temperature . thus clustering and percolation can provide a conceptual basis for the qcd phase diagram which is more general than symmetry breaking @xcite .",
