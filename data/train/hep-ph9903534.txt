    "the dynamics of non - equilibrium phase transitions and the ordering process that occurs until the system reaches a broken symmetry equilibrium state play an important role in many different areas .",
    "obviously in the physics of binary fluids and ferromagnets ( domain walls ) superfluids ( vortex formation ) , and liquid crystals ( many possible defects ) to name but a few in condensed matter , but also in cosmology and particle physics . in cosmology defects produced during grand unified theory ( gut ) or the electro - weak ( ew ) phase transition can act as seeds for the formation of large scale structure and the dynamics of phase ordering and formation of ordered regions is at the heart of kibble s mechanism of defect formation@xcite .",
    "current and future measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropies will determine the nature of the cosmological phase transitions that influenced structure formation@xcite . also at even lower energies ,",
    "available with current and forthcoming accelerators ( rhic and lhc ) the phase transitions predicted by the theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) could occur out of equilibrium via the formation of coherent condensates of low energy pions .",
    "these conjectured configurations known as ` disoriented chiral condensates ' are similar to the defects expected in liquid crystals or ferromagnets and their charge distribution could be an experimental telltale of the qcd phase transitions@xcite . whereas the gut phase transition took place",
    "when the universe was about @xmath2 seconds old and the temperature about @xmath3 , and the ew phase transition occured when the universe was @xmath4 seconds old and with a temperature @xmath5 , the qcd phase transition took place at about @xmath6 seconds after the big bang , when the temperature was a mere @xmath7 .",
    "this temperature range will be probed at rhic and lhc within the next very few years .",
    "the basic problem of describing the process of phase ordering and the competition between different broken symmetry states on the way towards reaching equilibrium is common to all of these situations .",
    "the tools , however , are necessarily very different : whereas ferromagnets , binary fluids or alloys etc , can be described via a phenomenological ( stochastic ) description , certainly in quantum systems a microscopic formulation must be provided . in these lectures",
    "we describe a program to include ideas from condensed matter to the realm of quantum field theory , to describe phenomena on a range of time and spatial scales of unprecedented resolution ( time scales @xmath8 seconds , spatial scales @xmath9 meters ) that require a full quantum field theoretical description .",
    "before tackling the problem of describing phase ordering kinetics in quantum systems starting from a microscopic theory , it proves illuminating to understand a large body of theoretical and experimental work in condensed matter systems@xcite-@xcite . although ultimately the tools to study the quantum problem will be different , the main physical features to describe are basically the same : the formation and evolution of correlated regions separated by ` walls ' or other structures . inside these regions",
    "an ordered phase exists which eventually grows to become macroscopic in size . before attempting to describe the manner in which a given system orders after being cooled through a phase transition an understanding of the relevant time scales is required .",
    "two important time scales determine if the transition occurs in or out of equilibrium : the relaxation time of long wavelength fluctuations ( since these are the ones that order ) @xmath10 and the inverse of the cooling rate @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath12 then these wavelengths are in local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) , but if @xmath13 these wavelengths fall out of lte and freeze out , for these the phase transition occurs in a quenched manner . these modes do not have time to adjust locally to the temperature change and for them the transition from a high temperature phase to a low temperature one occur instantaneously .",
    "this description was presented by zurek@xcite analysing the emergence of defect networks after a quenched phase transition . whereas the short wavelength modes are rapidly thermalized ( typically by collisions )",
    "the long - wavelength modes with @xmath14 with @xmath15 the correlation length ( in the disordered phase ) become _ critically slowed down_. as @xmath16 the long wavelength modes relax very slowly , they fall out of lte and any finite cooling rate causes them to undergo a quenched non - equilibrium phase transition .",
    "as the system is quenched from @xmath17 ( ordered phase ) to @xmath18 ( disordered phase ) ordering _ does not _ occur instantaneously .",
    "the length scale of the ordered regions grows in time ( after some initial transients ) as the different broken symmetry phases compete to select the final equilibrium state .",

    "thus , the energy is always diminishing and there is no possibility of increasing the free energy .",
    "thus overbarrier thermal activation can not be described in the absence of thermal noise , which is clear since thermal activation is mediated by large thermal fluctuations .",
    "the fact that this phenomenological description is purely dissipative with an ever diminishing free energy is one of the fundamental differences with the quantum field theory description studied in the next sections .",
    "critical slowing down of long - wavelength fluctuations is built in the tdgl description .",

    "we find numerically that this effective mass vanishes asymptotically , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the physical mechanism here is similar to that in the classical tdgl , but in terms of quantum fluctuations .",
    "the quantum fluctuations with wave vectors inside the spinodally unstable band grow exponentially , these make the @xmath169 self - consistent field to grow non - perturbatively large until when @xmath170 when the self - consistent ( mean ) field begins to be of the same order as @xmath171 ( the tree level mass term ) . at this point",

    "this in turn determines that the low @xmath176 ( long wavelength ) behavior of the mode functions is given by @xmath177    this behavior at long wavelength has a remarkable consequence : at very long time the power spectrum @xmath178 , which is the equivalent of @xmath179 for tdgl ( see eq .",
    "( [ strucfac ] ) ) is dominated by the small @xmath176-region , in particular @xmath180 , with an amplitude that grows quadratically with time .",

    "the pair correlation function can now be calculated using this power spectrum@xcite @xmath183 at long times and distances the integral is dominated by the very long wavelength modes , in particular by the term @xmath184/k$ ] of @xmath185 , hence the integral can be done analytically and we find @xmath186 with @xmath187 a constant .",
    "this is a remarkable result : the correlation falls off as @xmath188 inside domains that grow at the speed of light .",
    "this correlation function is shown in fig . 3 at several different ( large ) times .",
    "this correlation function is of the _ scaling form _ : introducing the dynamical length scale @xmath189 it is clear that@xcite @xmath190    we interpret these ` domains ' as being a non - perturbative condensate of goldstone bosons , with a non - perturbatively large number of them @xmath191 , such that the mean square root fluctuation of the field samples the ( non - perturbative ) equilibrium minima of the potential .",
    "in particular an important conclusion of this analysis is that the long - wavelength modes acquire very large amplitudes , their phases vary slowly as a function of time ( for @xmath192 ) , therefore these fluctuations which began their evolution as being quantum mechanical , now have become _",
    "classical_.      at this point our analysis begs this question . to understand the answer it is convenient to back track the analysis to the beginning",
    "the initial quantum state is given by a the wave - function(al ) ( [ wavefunc ] ) , thus the most probable field configurations found in this ensemble are those whose spatial fourier transform are given by @xmath193 ( restoring @xmath194 would multiply @xmath195 by @xmath196 )",
    ". then typical long - wavelength field configurations that are represented in the quantum ensemble described by this initial wave - function(al ) are of rather small amplitude .",
    "the initial correlations are also rather short ranged on scales @xmath197 .",

    "we note that a particular choice of these phases leads to a realization of a likely configuration in the ensemble that _ breaks translational invariance_. in fact translations can be absorbed by a change in the phases , thus averaging over these random phases restores translational invariance . since the quantum state ( or density matrix )",
    "is translational invariant a particular spatial profile for a field configuration corresponds to a particular representative of the ensemble . combining all of the above results together we can present the following consistent interpretation of the ordering process and the formation of coherent non - perturbative structures during the dynamics of symmetry breaking in the large @xmath0 limit@xcite :    * the early time evolution occurs via the exponential growth of spinodally unstable long wavelength modes .",
    "this unstable growth leads to a rapid growth of fluctuations @xmath204 which in turn increases the self - consistent contribution and tends to cancel the negative mass squared .",
    "the effective mass of the excitations @xmath205 and the asymptotic excitations are goldstone bosons . * at times larger than the spinodal time @xmath206 , the effective mass vanishes and the power spectrum or structure factor @xmath207 displays the features of coarsening : a peak that moves towards longer wavelengths and increases in amplitude , resulting in a long - wavelength condensate at asymptotically long times . * for large time a dynamical correlation length emerges @xmath208 and at long distances the pair correlation function is of the scaling form @xmath209 .",

    "the similarity between these results and those of the more phenomenological tdgl description in condensed matter systems is rather striking .",
    "the features that are determined by the structure of the quantum field theory are@xcite : i ) the scaling variable @xmath210 with equal powers of distance and time is a consequence of the lorentz invariance of the underlying theory , ii ) the fact that the pair correlation function vanishes for @xmath211 is manifestly a consequence of causality .",
    "an analysis of the correlations and defect density during the spinodal time scale has been performed in@xcite and related recent studies had been performed in@xcite .",
    "on large scales @xmath212 the universe appears to be homogeneous and isotropic as revealed by the isotropy and homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background and some of the recent large scale surveys@xcite .",
    "the cosmological principle leads to a simple form of the metric of space time , the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric in terms of a scale factor that determines the hubble flow and the curvature of spatial sections .",
    "observations seem to favor a flat universe for which the space time metric is rather simple : @xmath213 the time and spatial variables @xmath214 in the above metric are called comoving time and spatial distance respectively and have the interpretation of being the time and distance measured by an observer locally at rest with respect to the hubble flow . at this point we must note that _ physical distances _ are given by @xmath215 .",
    "an important concept is that of causal ( particle ) horizons : events that can not be connected by a light signal are causally disconnected . since light travels on null geodesics @xmath216 the maximum _ physical _ distance that can be reached by a light signal at time @xmath217 is given by @xmath218 it will prove convenient to change coordinates to _ conformal time _ by defining a conformal time variable @xmath219 in terms of which the causal horizon is simply given by @xmath220 and physical distances as @xmath221 .",

    "the answer to this question is : gravity is classical , fields are quantum mechanical , but @xmath229 , i.e. it is the expectation value of a _ quantum mechanical operator in a quantum mechanical state_. this quantum mechanical state , either pure or mixed is described by a wave - function(al ) or a density matrix whose time evolution is dictated by the quantum equations of motion : the schrdinger equation for the wave functions or the quantum liouville equation for a density matrix .",

    "the above equations of motion has now an analogous form as those solved in the case of minkowski space - time .",
    "as the temperature falls below the critical the effective squared mass term becomes negative and spinodal instabilities trigger the process of phase ordering .",
    "this results in that the quantum fluctuations quantified by @xmath261 grow exponentially .",
    "these spinodal instabilities make the self - consistent field grow at early times and tends to overcome the negative sign of the squared mass , eventually reaching an asymptotic regime in which the total effective mass @xmath262 vanishes .",
    "again this behavior determines that the fluctuations are sampling the equilibrium broken symmetry minima of the initial potential , i.e. @xmath263 .",
    "although , just as in minkowski space - time the effective mass vanishes asymptotically , the non - equilibrium evolution is rather _",
    "different_. we find numerically@xcite that asymptotically the effective mass term @xmath264 vanishes as @xmath265 .",
    "4 displays @xmath266 as a function of conformal time for the case of @xmath267 with @xmath268@xcite .",
    "we see that at very early time the mass is positive , reflecting the fact that the initial state is in equilibrium at an initial temperature larger than the critical .",
    "as time evolves the temperature is red - shifted and cools and at some point the phase transition occurs , when the mass vanishes and becomes negative .",
    "figure 5 displays @xmath269 vs. @xmath270 in units of @xmath197 for @xmath271 , @xmath272 for an r.d . universe .",
    "clearly at large times the non - equilibrium fluctuations probe the broken symmetry states .",
    "this particular asymptotic behavior of the mass determines that the mode functions @xmath273 grow as @xmath274 for @xmath275 and oscillate in the form @xmath276 for @xmath277 .",

    "we find both analytically and numerically that asymptotically the mode functions are of the _ scaling form _",
    "@xmath278 where @xmath187 is a numerical constant and @xmath279 is a bessel function .",
    "figure 6 displays @xmath280 as a function of the scaling variable @xmath281 revealing the scaling behavior .",
    "it is remarkable that this is exactly the same scaling solution found in the _ classical _ non - linear sigma model in the large @xmath0 limit and that describes the collapse of textures@xcite , and also within the context of tdgl equations in the large @xmath0 limit applied to cosmology@xcite .",
    "the growth of the long - wavelength modes and the oscillatory behavior of the short wavelength modes again results in that the peak of the structure factor @xmath282 moves towards longer wavelengths and the maximum amplitude increases .",
    "this is the equivalent of coarsening and the onset of a condensate .",
    "although quantitatively different from minkowsky space time , the qualitative features are similar .",
    "asymptotically the non - equilibrium dynamics results in the formation of a non - perturbative condensate of long - wavelength goldstone bosons .",
    "we can now compute the pair correlation function @xmath283 from the mode functions ( [ scalingfrw ] ) and find that it is cutoff by causality at @xmath284 .",
    "the correlation function is depicted in fig . 4 for two different ( conformal ) times .",
    "the scaling form of the pair correlation function is @xmath285 where @xmath286 is a hump - shaped function as shown in fig .",
    "7 .    clearly a _ dynamical _ length scale @xmath287 emerges as a consequence of causality , much in the same manner as in minkowsky space time .",
    "the _ physical _ dynamical correlation length is therefore given by @xmath288 , that is the correlated domains grow again at the speed of light and their size is given by the causal horizon .",
    "the interpretation of this phenomenon is that within one causal horizon there is one correlated domain , inside which the mean square root fluctuation of the field is approximately the value of the equilibrium minima of the tree level potential , this is clearly consistent with kibble s original observation@xcite . inside this domain",
    "there is a non - perturbative condensate of goldstone bosons@xcite .",
    "in these lectures we have discussed the multidisciplinary nature of the problem of phase ordering kinetics and non - equilibrium aspects of symmetry breaking .",
    "main ideas from condensed matter were discussed and presented in a simple but hopefully illuminating framework and applied to the rather different realm of phase transitions in quantum field theory as needed to understand cosmology and particle physics .",
    "the large @xmath0 approximation has provided a bridge that allows to cross from one field to another and borrow many of the ideas that had been tested both theoretically and experimentally in condensed matter physics .",
    "there are , however , major differences between the condensed matter and particle physics - cosmology applications that require a very careful treatment of the quantum field theory that can not be replaced by simple arguments .",
    "the large @xmath0 approximation in field theory provides a robust , consistent non - perturbative framework that allows the study of phase ordering kinetics and dynamics of symmetry breaking in a controlled and consistently implementable framework , it is renormalizable , respects all symmetries and can be improved in a well defined manner .",
    "this scheme extracts cleanly the non - perturbative behavior , the quantum to classical transition and allows to quantify in a well defined manner the emergence of classical stochastic behavior arising from non - perturbative physics .",
    "the emergence of scaling and a dynamical correlation length are robust features of the dynamics and the kibble - zurek scenario describes fairly well the general features of the dynamics , albeit the details require careful study , both analytically and numerically .",
    "of course this is just the beginning , we expect a wealth of important phenomena to be revealed beyond the large @xmath1 , such as the approach to equilibrium , the emergence of other time scales associated with a hydrodynamic description of the evolution at late times and a more careful understanding of the reheating process and its influence on cosmological observables .",
    "although within very few years the wealth of observational data will provide a more clear picture of the cosmological fluctuations , it is clear that the program that pursues a fundamental understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms will continue seeking to provide a consistent microscopic description of the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions .",
