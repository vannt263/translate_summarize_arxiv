    "( in specific applications one can frequently show that @xmath174 vanishes . )",
    "it therefore follows that in the background field of instantons , the euclidean dirac equation possesses zero modes .",

    "this is because a chiral transformation that redefines the massless dirac field does not modify the classical action , but owing to the chiral non - invariance of the functional measure , ( [ eqtwo32 ] ) , an anomaly term is induced in the ( effective ) quantum action .",
    "the strength of this induced term can be fixed so that it cancels the @xmath90-term in ( [ eqtwo24 ] ) .",

    "the tunneling leads to baryon decay , but fortunately at an exponentially small rate .",
    "more useful is the fact that instanton tunneling gives semi - classical evidence for the removal of an unwanted chiral @xmath13 goldstone symmetry , which would be present in the standard model if the chiral anomaly did not interfere .",
    "furthermore , the chiral anomaly facilitates the decay of the neutral pion to two photons ; a process forbidden by other apparent chiral symmetries of the standard model , which in fact are modified by the chiral anomaly .",
    "gauge fields in four dimensions must interact with anomaly - free currents .",

    "this current remains conserved in the quantized version because it couples to the gauge field .",

    "but in parallel with 4-dimensional behavior , the model with massive fermions regains a @xmath90 dependence in the particles energy spectrum ; a result that is established perturbatively , because a complete solution is not available .    note that in the schwinger model , the gauge particle (  photon \" ) acquires a mass , even though local gauge invariance is preserved",
    "this happens essentially for topological / anomaly reasons .",
    "such topological mass generation is met again in three dimensions .",
    "scalar electrodynamics with a negative mass squared term in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space - time leads to the higgs mechanism and short range interactions due to the massive photons . in @xmath233 space - time dimensions , the model possesses instantons  scalar and gauge field profiles that solve the imaginary - time equations of motion  labeled by @xmath234 .",
    "these disorder the higgs condensate so that the force between charged particles remains long - range , like in the positive mass squared case .",
    "this is a vivid example of how excitations arising from non - trivial topological issues significantly effect physical content .",
    "gauge theories on three dimensional space - time , _ i.e. _ evolving on a plane , have physical application to planar phenomena , like the quantum hall effect . also the high - temperature limit of 4-dimensional field theories is governed by the corresponding field theory in three euclidean dimensions .    in three ( more generally , odd ) dimensions",
    "there are no chern - pontryagin quantities , no chern - simon currents , no axial vector currents or anomalies ( there is no @xmath235 matrix ) .",
    "these are replaced by odd - dimensional entities that can modify yang - mills dynamics .      using the 3-index levi - civita tensor",
    "one can construct a gauge covariant , covariatly conserved vector , which can be added to the yang - mills equation .",
    "thus ( [ eqone14 ] ) can be modified to    [ eqfour1 ] @xmath236 or equivalently in terms of the dual field strength @xmath237 @xmath238    for dimensional balance @xmath147 carries dimension of mass . indeed in the source - free case ( [ eqfour1 ] )",
    "implies @xmath239 .",

    "otherwise as in the dirac monopole case , the equations of motion are unexceptional .    however , for the quantum theory we need the action , whose variation produces the mass term in ( [ eqfour1 ] ) .",
    "this is just the chern - simons term @xmath138 in ( [ eqtwo22 ] ) , multiplied by @xmath240 and now defined on ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time .",
    "@xmath241 \\label{eqfour3}\\ ] ] everything holds also in the abelian theory ; the last term in ( [ eqfour3 ] ) is then absent .    in this model",
    "the mass is generated by a topological mechanism since @xmath242 possesses the usual attributes for a topological entity : it is diffeomorphisms invariant without a metric tensor ; when the potentials are appropriately parameterized , it is given by a surface term .",
    "( in the abelian case the appropriate parameterization is in terms of clebsch decomposition , @xmath243 ) most importantly , in the non - abelian theory ( [ eqfour3 ] ) changes by @xmath244 with 3-dimensional gauge transformations carrying winding number @xmath77 .",
    "hence for consistency of the non - abelian quantum theory @xmath147 must be quantized as @xmath245 ( in units of @xmath232 and the coupling constant , which have been scaled to unity ) .",
    "all this is a clear field - theoretic analog to the quantum mechanics of the dirac monopole , and just as for the magnetic monopole , a hamiltonian argument for quantizing @xmath147 can be constructed , as an alternative to the above action - based derivation .",
    "the time component of ( [ eqfour1 ] ) relates the electric and magnetic fields to the charge density .",
    "@xmath246 in the abelian case , the first term involves a total derivative and its spatial integral vanishes , leaving a formula that identifies magnetic flux with a total charge . at low energy ,",
    "the mass term dominates the conventional kinetic term in ( [ eqfour1 ] ) , and the flux - charge relation becomes a local field - current identity .",
    "these formulas have made chern - simons - modified gauge theories relevant to issues in condensed matter physics , for example the quantum hall effect . in the abelian case",
    "@xmath147 need not be quantized .",
    "3-dimensional dirac matrices are minimally realized by 2x2 pauli matrices .",
    "this has the consequenced that a mass term is not parity invariant ; also there is no @xmath235 matrix , since the product of the three dirac ( = pauli ) matrices is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "while there are no chiral anomalies , there is the so - called parity anomaly : integrating a single doublet of massless @xmath86 fermions one obtains @xmath248 $ ] , which should preserve parity and gauge invariance .",
    "since there are no anomalies in current divergences , @xmath249 is certainly invariant against infinitesimal gauge transformations .",
    "but for finite gauge transformations ( categorized by @xmath250 one finds that @xmath251 is not invariant : when the gauge transformation belongs to an odd - numbered homotopy class , @xmath251 changes sign . to regain gauge invariance one must either work with an even number of fermion doublets .",
    "if only one doublet ( more generally odd number ) is to be used , one must add to the gauge lagrangian a parity - violating chern - simons term with half the correctly quantized coefficient , to neutralize the gauge non - invariance of @xmath251 .",
    "alternatively @xmath251 can be regularized in gauge invariant manner . but",
    "this requires massive , pauli - villars regulator fields , which produce a parity - violating expression for @xmath251 .",
    "one can not avoid the parity anomaly .",
    "there is a variety of bosonic field models that one may consider : abelian or non - abelian ; with conventional kinetic term or supplemented by the chern - simons topological mass ; or for low energy no kinetic term but only the chern - simons term , as in ( [ eqfour5 ] ) .",
    "abelian charged bose fields in a maxwell theory lead to vortex solitons , based on @xmath252 .",
    "these are just the instantons of the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional bosonic gauge theory discussed previously . with maxwell kinematics",
    "there are no charged vortices , but these appear when the chen - simons mass is added ; see ( [ eqfour4 ] ) .",
    "pure chern - simons kinematics , with no maxwell term can produce completely integrable soliton equations , ( liouville , toda ) when the bose field dynamics is appropriately chosen .",
    "topological effects in field theory are associated with the infinities and regularization that beset quantum field theories .",
    "these give rise to the chiral anomaly , parity anomaly ( and scale symmetry anomalies , not discussed here ) .",
    "yet the anomalies themselves are finite quantities that have topological significance ( atiyah - singer , chern - pontryagin , chern - simons ) .",
    "this paradoxical pairing has not been understood . nor",
    "can we explain why the anomalies interfere in a topological manner with symmetries associated with masslessness .",
    "although the range of topological effects in gauge theory is large , and even larger in non - gauge theories ( sigma models , skyrme models ) the relevance to actual fundamental physics is confined to the @xmath90-angle phenomenon , which is analyzed accurately and abstractly by reference to @xmath253 and to the interplay with fermions through the chiral anomaly .",
    "instantons are relevant only to an approximate , semi - classical discussion . although after much mathematical work , general instanton configurations are well - understood , only the 1-instanton solution enjoys physical significance .",
    "other topological entities that fascinate are either non - existent in fundamental physics or are relevant to condensed matter physics ( vortices , chern - simons effects ) . but here too , we note that the fundamental equation of condensed matter physics  the many body schrdinger equation  carries no evident topological structure .",
    "only the phenomenological equations , which replace the fundamental one , give rise to topological intricacies .",
