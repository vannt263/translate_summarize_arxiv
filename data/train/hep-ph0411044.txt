    "the super - kamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite , kamland @xcite and k2k @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very compelling evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed .",
    "this important result indicates that the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is actually as incomplete as the standard model in describing the neutrino phenomenology .",
    "a very simple but natural extension of the mssm is to include one right - handed neutrino in each of three lepton families , while the lagrangian of electroweak interactions keeps invariant under @xmath3 gauge transformation . in this case",
    ", the lagrangian responsible for lepton masses can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand respectively for the right - handed charged lepton and majorana neutrino singlets , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( with hypercharges @xmath10 ) are the mssm higgs doublets . after spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking ,",
    "one obtains the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath11 and the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath12",
    ". the scale of @xmath13 may be considerably higher than @xmath14 , because right - handed neutrinos are @xmath15 singlets and their mass term is not subject to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "thus the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath16 can be derived from @xmath17 and @xmath13 via the seesaw relation @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "although this elegant relation can qualitatively attribute the smallness of left - handed neutrino masses to the largeness of right - handed neutrino masses , it is unable to make any concrete predictions unless a specific lepton flavor structure is assumed .",
    "hence an appropriate combination of the seesaw mechanism and possible flavor symmetries or texture zeros @xcite is practically needed , in order to quantitatively account for the neutrino mass spectrum and lepton flavor mixing .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to incorporate the seesaw mechanism with the fritzsch - like textures of lepton mass matrices listed in table 1 .",
    "those six patterns of @xmath19 and @xmath16 are actually isomeric @xcite ; i.e. , they have the same phenomenological consequences , although their structures are apparently different from one another .",
    "if @xmath17 and @xmath13 take the same fritzsch - like form as @xmath19 and @xmath16 do , then the seesaw relation @xmath18 will in general be violated .",
    "we shall show that this relation can keep unchanged , provided the condition @xmath20 is satisfied . in this case",
    ", each nonvanishing matrix element of @xmath16 has a simple seesaw relation with its counterparts in @xmath17 and @xmath13 ; i.e. , @xmath21 the textures of @xmath17 , @xmath13 and @xmath16 in table 1 are therefore referred to as the seesaw - invariant textures . because the parameters of @xmath16 can essentially be determined from current neutrino oscillation data @xcite , it is then possible to impose useful constraints on the parameters of @xmath17 and @xmath13 via eq .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to account for the cosmological baryon number asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis @xcite . indeed ,",
    "lepton number violation induced by the third term of @xmath22 allows decays of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath23 ( for @xmath24 ) to happen .",
    "since the decay can occur at both tree and one - loop levels , their interference may result in a @xmath25-violating asymmetry @xmath26 between the @xmath25-conjugated @xmath27 and @xmath28 processes .",
    "if the masses of @xmath23 are hierarchical ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) , the interactions of @xmath30 can be in thermal equilibrium when @xmath31 and @xmath32 decay .",
    "the asymmetries @xmath33 and @xmath34 are therefore erased before @xmath30 decays , and only the asymmetry @xmath35 produced by the out - of - equilibrium decay of @xmath30 survives .",
    "the point of leptogenesis @xcite is that @xmath35 may give rise to a net lepton number asymmetry @xmath36 , which is eventually converted into a net baryon number asymmetry @xmath37 via nonperturbative sphaleron processes @xcite : @xmath38 .",
    "thus this mechanism provides a natural interpretation of the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry , @xmath39 , which is drawn from the recent wmap observational data @xcite .",
    "we shall show that six fritzsch - like textures of lepton mass matrices in table 1 yield the same @xmath35 and @xmath37 , from which useful constraints on the mass scale of three right - handed neutrinos and the majorana phase of cp violation can be obtained .",
    "the third purpose of this paper is to calculate the rare lepton - flavor - violating processes @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we shall focus our attention on a rather conservative case of lepton flavor violation , based on the scenarios where supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector and the breaking is transmitted to the observable sector by a flavor - blind mechanism .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath43 depend strongly upon the phase parameters responsible for leptogenesis and for cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "now let us show that the seesaw relation @xmath18 will hold for each of the six patterns listed in table 1 , if and only if the condition @xmath20 is satisfied .",
    "to be explicit , we take pattern ( a )  namely , the fritzsch texture @xcite , for example . given the fritzsch form of @xmath17 and @xmath13 , the seesaw relation leads straightforwardly to @xmath44 one can see that the second term of eq .",

    "of course , the magnitudes of @xmath187 will change , if different values of the supersymmetric parameters are input .",
    "instead of examining the full parameter space , here we have paid our main attention to the parameter correlation between leptogenesis and lepton - flavor - violating processes .",
    "let us remark that the gravity mediation scenario used in evaluating lepton flavor violation is in potential conflict with the lower bound of @xmath139 obtained from thermal leptogenesis in our ansatz .",
    "this problem , usually referred to as the gravitino problem , exists in many supersymmetric seesaw models ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one possible way out is to fine - tune the model parameters ( i.e. , those of @xmath199 and @xmath13 ) or assume the masses of heavy right - handed neutrinos to be nearly degenerate @xcite within the thermal leptogenesis mechanism . as for our universal fritzsch - like textures of lepton mass matrices , however , we are not left with much room for the fine - tuning of model parameters .",
    "the assumption of a near mass degeneracy for heavy majorana neutrinos seems not to be natural either , although it is not impossible .",
    "we find that there actually exists an interesting solution to the gravitino problem @xcite , which is in no apparent conflict with our phenomenological scenario .",
    "its key point is that the axino and gravitino can be the lightest ( of @xmath158 kev ) and the next lightest ( of @xmath200 gev ) supersymmetric particles , respectively , in a large class of supersymmetric axion models .",
    "thus the reheating temperature is allowed to reach @xmath201 gev or so @xcite , high enough for the thermal leptogenesis mechanism to work .",
    "some more discussions in this connection will be presented elsewhere @xcite , since they are already beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we have incorporated the seesaw mechanism with six fritzsch - like textures of lepton mass matrices . it is found that the seesaw relation holds under a particular condition , and the consequences of those textures on lepton flavor mixing are exactly the same . applying this simple ansatz to thermal leptogenesis",
    ", we have shown that cp violation in the lepton - number - violating decays of heavy right - handed neutrinos depends only upon a single phase parameter and the cosmological baryon number asymmetry can naturally be explained .",
    "the lepton - flavor - violating processes @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 have also been calculated .",
    "an interesting result is that the branching ratios of those rare processes rely strongly upon the phase parameters appearing in leptogenesis and in neutrino oscillations .",
    "we expect that a stringent test of our phenomenological scenario will be available in the near future , when more precise experimental data are accumulated .",
