    "in @xcite we presented explicit computations of classes in the grothendieck ring of varieties , of chern  schwartz  macpherson characteristic classes , and by specialization euler characteristics , for some particular classes of graph hypersurfaces .",
    "the latter are singular projective hypersurfaces associated to the parametric formulation of feynman integrals in scalar quantum field theories and have recently been the object of extensive investigation ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to answer a question posed to us by the referee of @xcite .",
    "we describe the problem here briefly , along with the necessary background .",
    "all this will be discussed in more details in the body of the paper .    for us",
    "a feynman graph @xmath0 will be a finite graph whose set of edges consists of internal edges @xmath1 and external edges @xmath2 .",
    "whenever we focus on invariants that only involve internal edges , we can assume that @xmath0 is just a graph in the ordinary sense .",
    "consider a graph @xmath0 consisting of two components , @xmath3 . to each component",
    "we can associate a corresponding graph hypersurface @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of internal edges of the feynman graph @xmath7 .",
    "the feynman integral @xmath8 , with assigned external momenta @xmath9 for @xmath10 , is computed in the parametric form as an integral over a simplex @xmath11 of an algebraic differential form defined on the hypersurface complement @xmath12 .",
    "the multiplicative property of the feynman rules implies that , for a graph @xmath13 , one correspondingly has @xmath14 , so that it is customary in quantum field theory to pass from the partition function whose asymptotic series involves all graphs to the one that only involves connected graphs .",
    "a further simplification of the combinatorics of graphs that takes place in quantum field theory is obtained by passing to the 1pi effective action , which only involves graphs that are 2-edge - connected ( 1-particle irreducible in the physics terminology ) , _ i.e. _  that can not be disconnected by removal of a single edge .",
    "the connes  kreimer theory @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) shows that the feynman rules define a character of the connes  kreimer hopf algebra @xmath15 of feynman graphs .",
    "namely , the collection of dimensionally regularized feynman integrals @xmath16 of all the 1pi graphs of a given scalar quantum field theory defines a homomorphism of unital commutative algebras @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the field of germs of meromorphic functions at @xmath19 .",
    "the coproduct in the hopf algebra is then used in @xcite to obtain a recursive formula for the birkhoff factorization of loops in the pro - unipotent complex lie group @xmath20 .",
    "this provides the counterterms and the renormalized values of all the feynman integrals in the form of what is known in physics as the bogolyubov recursion , or bphz renormalization procedure .    in particular , any character of the hopf algebra @xmath15",
    "can be thought of as a possible assignment of feynman rules for the given field theory , and the renormalization procedure can be applied to any such character as to the case of the feynman integrals . in turn , the characters need not necessarily take values in the field @xmath18 of convergent laurent series for the bphz renormalization procedure to make sense .",
    "in fact , it was shown in @xcite how the same connes  kreimer recursive formula for the birkhoff factorization of loops continues to work unchanged whenever the target of the hopf algebra character is a rota ",
    "baxter algebra of weight @xmath21 . in the connes ",
    "kreimer case , it is the operator of projection of a laurent series onto its divergent part that is a rota ",
    "baxter operator and the rota ",
    "baxter identity is what is needed to show that , in the birkhoff factorization @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the antipode and @xmath24 the product dual to the coproduct , the two terms @xmath25 are also algebra homomorphisms .",
    "when working in the algebro - geometric world of the graph hypersurfaces @xmath26 , one would like to have ",
    "motivic feynman rules \" , namely an assignment of an euler characteristic @xmath27 ( the class in the grothendieck ring of varieties is a universal euler characteristic ) to the graph hypersurface complements @xmath28 with the property that , in the case of graphs @xmath0 consisting of several disjoint components @xmath29 , one has @xmath30 as in the case of the feynman integrals @xmath31 . here",
    "the graph hypersurface @xmath26 associated to a graph @xmath0 is defined as the hypersurface in @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) given by the vanishing of the polynomial @xmath34 with the sum over spanning forests @xmath35 of @xmath0 , and the product of the edge variables @xmath36 of the edges @xmath37 of @xmath0 that are not in the forest @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath38 is a disjoint union , then clearly @xmath39    one can see that the usual euler characteristic does not satisfy the desired property .",
    "in fact , if @xmath0 is not a forest , one can see that the hypersurface complement @xmath28 is a @xmath40-bundle over the product @xmath41 , hence its euler characteristic vanishes and the multiplicative property can not be satisfied .",
    "the question the referee of @xcite asked us is whether there exists a natural modification @xmath27 of the usual euler characteristic that restores the multiplicative property , thus giving an interesting example of algebro  geometric feynman rules .",
    "the main result of the present paper is to show that indeed such modifications of the euler characteristic exist and they can be obtained from already well known natural enhancements of the euler characteristic in the context of algebraic geometry . in particular , we produce one such invariant obtained using classes in the grothendieck ring of varieties , and one obtained using the chern  schwartz ",
    "macpherson characteristic class of singular algebraic varieties , @xcite @xcite , and we show that both descend from a common invariant that lives in a  grothendieck ring of immersed conical varieties \" .    the first case , where one considers an invariant with values in the usual grothendieck ring , has the advantage that it is _ motivic _ , so it indeed defines ",
    "motivic feynman rules \" as the referee suggested , and also it is in general easier to compute explicitly , while the second case where the invariant is constructed in terms of characteristic classes is more difficult to compute , but it has the advantage that it takes values in a more manageable polynomial ring .",
    "we discuss the meaning of the bphz renormalization procedure in the connes ",
    "kreimer form for some of these invariants , using suitable rota ",
    "baxter operators on polynomial algebras .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we recall briefly in  [ friqft ] the properties of feynman integrals and feynman rules in perturbative scalar quantum field theory , as those serve as a model for our algebro - geometric definition . in  [ fragsec ]",
    "we introduce the notion of algebro - geometric feynman rules , by requiring that the multiplicative invariants associated to graphs depend on the data of the affine hypersurface complement , up to linear changes of coordinates .",
    "we show in  [ univsec ] that there is a universal algebro - geometric feynman rule that takes values in a suitably defined grothendieck ring of immersed conical varieties , @xmath42 .",
    "we show how the values behave under simple operations on graphs , such as bisecting and edge , connecting graphs by a vertex or an edge , etc .",
    "the existence of this universal algebro - geometric feynman rule is based on the multiplicative property of the affine hypersurface complements over disjoint unions of graphs , which does not hold in the projective setting .",
    "we then show in  [ motfrules ] that the universal feynman rule maps to a motivic feynman rule with values in the usual grothendieck ring of varieties , by considering varieties up to isomorphism instead of the more restrictive linear changes of coordinates .",
    "we give an explicit relation between the class of the affine hypersurface complement and the class of the projective hypersurface in the grothendieck ring . as a consequence of the basic properties of algebro - geometric feynman rules , we show in proposition [ sb1pi ] that the stable birational equivalence class of the projective graph hypersurface of a non-1pi graph is equal to @xmath43 .",
    "we also discuss how the parametric formulation of feynman integrals , in the case with nonzero mass and zero external momenta , may fit in the setting of algebro - geometric feynman rules with values in the algebra of periods .",
    "the issue of the divergences of these integrals is further discussed in  [ rensec ] . in  [ charsec ]",
    "we introduce a different algebro - geometric feynman rule , that is obtained by mapping the ring @xmath42 to the polynomial ring @xmath44 $ ] via a morphism defined in terms of the chern  schwartz ",
    "macpherson ( csm ) characteristic classes of singular algebraic varieties .",
    "this morphism @xmath45 $ ] does _ not _ factor through the usual grothendieck ring of varieties @xmath46 , as we show explicitly in example  [ exb3tri ] .",
    "the main theorem showing the multiplicative property of this polynomial invariant over disjoint unions of graphs is stated in theorem [ mainhomo ] , and its proof is reduced in steps to a formula , given in theorem  [ thmjoin ] , for the chern - schwartz - macpherson classes of joins of disjoint subvarieties of projective space . in this same section ,",
    "proposition [ propsc ] lists the main properties of the polynomial invariant , including the fact that it recovers as a special value of the derivative the usual euler characteristic of the projective hypersurface complements , thus effectively correcting for its failure to be a feynman rule . a way to compute the coefficients of the polynomial invariant in terms of integrals of differential forms with logarithmic poles on a resolution",
    "is given in remark  [ anint ] .",
    "the following section ,  [ rensec ] , discusses the bphz renormalization procedure , in the formulation of the connes ",
    "kreimer theory in terms of birkhoff factorization of characters of the hopf algebra of feynman graphs . using the formulation in terms of characters with values in a rota ",
    "baxter algebra of weight @xmath47 , one can show that the bphz procedure can be applied to the various cases of algebro - geometric feynman rules considered here . in ",
    "[ zsec ] we draw some analogies between the partition functions obtained by summing over graphs the algebro - geometric feynman rules and the motivic zeta functions considered in the theory of motivic integration .",
    "finally ,  [ joinpf ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ thmjoin ] .",
    "the main ingredients in the proof are kwieciski s product formula and yokura s riemann  roch theorem for csm classes , together with a blow - up construction .      the feynman rules prescribe that , in perturbative scalar quantum field theory , one assigns to a feynman graph a formal ( usually divergent ) integral @xmath48 where @xmath49 , with @xmath50 the coupling constant of the monomial in the lagrangian of degree equal to the valence of the vertex @xmath51 . here , @xmath33 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the matrix @xmath53 is the incidence matrix of the ( oriented ) graph with entries @xmath54 if the edge @xmath55 is incident to the vertex @xmath51 , outgoing or ingoing , and zero otherwise .",
    "the @xmath56 are the _",
    "feynman propagators_. the latter are quadratic forms , given in euclidean signature by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the momentum variable associated to the edge @xmath55 of the graph , with @xmath59 the euclidean square norm in @xmath60 and @xmath61 the mass parameter .",
    "the integral @xmath16 is a function of the external momenta @xmath62 , where the @xmath63 satisfy the conservation law @xmath64 .",
    "the delta function in the numerator of imposes linear relations at each vertex between the momentum variables , so that momentum conservation is preserved at each vertex .",
    "this reduces the number of independent variables of integration from the number of edges to the number of loops .",
    "the form of the feynman integral immediately implies a multiplicative property .",
    "namely , if the feynman graph is a disjoint union @xmath65 of two components , then the integral satisfies @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the external momenta of the graphs @xmath7 , with @xmath68 .",
    "this follows from the fact that there are no linear relations between the momentum variables assigned to edges in different connected components of the graph , so the integral splits as a product",
    ".    in quantum field theory one usually assembles the feynman integrals of different graphs in a formal series that gives , for fixed external momenta @xmath69 , the green function @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the symmetries of the graph . for a graph with several connected components",
    ", the symmetry factor behaves like @xmath72 where the @xmath73 are the multiplicities ( _ i.e. _  there are @xmath73 connected components of @xmath0 all isomorphic to the same graph @xmath74 ) .",
    "thus , one can simplify the combinatorics of graphs in quantum field theory by considering only connected graphs and the corresponding connected green functions .",
    "one can further reduce the class of graphs that need to be considered , by passing to the 1pi effective action , where only the graphs that are  one - particle - irreducible \" ( 1pi ) are considered .",
    "these are the two  edge  connected graphs , namely those that can not be disconnected by removal of a single edge .",
    "the reason why these suffice is again related to the multiplicative properties of feynman rules .",
    "a connected graph @xmath0 can be described as a tree @xmath35 in which at the vertices one inserts 1pi graphs @xmath75 with number of external edges equal to the valence of the vertex .",
    "the corresponding feynman integral can then be written in the form of a product @xmath76 _ i.e. _  a product of feynman integrals for 1pi graphs and inverses of the propagators @xmath77 for the edges of the tree , with momenta matching the external momenta of the 1pi graphs .",
    "when one takes the dimensional regularization of the feynman integrals , one replaces the formal @xmath78 by laurent series , while maintaining the multiplicative properties over disjoint unions of graphs .",
    "thus , if one defines a polynomial ring @xmath15 generated by the 1pi graphs with the product corresponding to the disjoint union , the dimensionally regularized feynman integral defines a ring homomorphism from @xmath15 to the ring @xmath79 of convergent laurent series . when the polynomial ring @xmath15 on the 1pi graphs is endowed with the connes",
    " kreimer coproduct as in @xcite , and the ring of convergent laurent series is endowed with the rota ",
    "baxter operator @xmath80 of projection onto the polar part , one can implement the bphz renormalization of the feynman integral as in the connes ",
    "kreimer theory @xcite as the birkhoff factorization of the feynman integrals @xmath78 into a product of ring homomorphisms from @xmath15 to @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively defining the counterterms and the renormalized part of the feynman integral .    in the following section",
    "we show how to abstract this setting to define algebro  geometric feynman rules .",
    "we give an abstract definition of feynman rules which encompasses the case of feynman integrals recalled above and that allows for algebro - geometric variants .",
    "[ feyruledef ] a feynman rule is an assignment of an element @xmath83 in a commutative ring @xmath79 for each finite graph @xmath0 , with the property that , for a disjoint union @xmath84 of connected graphs @xmath7 , the function behaves multiplicatively @xmath85 one also requires that , for a connected graph @xmath0 described as a finite tree @xmath35 with vertices replaced by 1pi graphs @xmath75 , the function @xmath83 satisfies @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the graph consisting of a single edge .",
    "thus , a feynman rule determines and is determined by a ring homomorphism @xmath88 , where @xmath15 is the polynomial ring generated ( over @xmath89 ) by the 1pi graphs and by the assignment of the _ inverse propagator _ @xmath90 .",
    "the definition we give here , which will suffice for our purposes , covers the original feynman integrals only in the case where one neglects the external momenta ( or sets them all to zero ) and remains with a nontrivial propagator for external edges given only by the mass @xmath91 .",
    "in fact , in that case , the formula reduces to with @xmath92 for all the external edges of the graphs @xmath75 .",
    "the property is the multiplicative property of the feynman rules .",
    "the dimensionally regularized feynman integral @xmath83 is described then in terms of a ring homomorphism @xmath93 to the ring of convergent laurent series , by identifying a monomial @xmath94 in @xmath15 with the disjoint union graph @xmath95 .",
    "we are especially interested in algebro - geometric feynman rules associated to the parametric representation of feynman integrals . in the parametric representation for a massless theory ,",
    "one reformulates the integral in the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 with @xmath33 , integrated over the simplex @xmath98 , with volume form @xmath99 and with @xmath100 the kirchhoff polynomial @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the circuit matrix of the graph ( depending on a choice of orientation of the edges @xmath55 and of a basis @xmath103 of @xmath104 ) , @xmath105 ( this is equivalent to the definition given in the introduction . ) if @xmath106 , we take @xmath107 .    the function @xmath108 is a homogeneus polynomial in @xmath109 of degree @xmath110 , which also has a definition in terms of the combinatorics of the graph .",
    "notice that one can define parametric representations in the case of massive theories @xmath111 as well and obtain a formulation similar to , @xmath112 where , however , @xmath113 is no longer a homogeneous polynomial in @xmath109 .",
    "our definition of feynman rules in definition [ feyruledef ] is modeled on the massive case , because of the propagators @xmath90 in .",
    "in both the massive and the massless case , at least for sufficiently large spacetime dimension @xmath114 , in the range where @xmath115 , the integral lives naturally on the complement in @xmath116 of the affine hypersurface @xmath117    in the massless case where both @xmath100 and @xmath108 in are homogeneous polynomials , one usually reformulates the feynman integral in terms of projective varieties and considers the complement @xmath28 of the projective hypersurface @xmath118 of which @xmath119 is the affine cone .",
    "although working in the projective setting is very natural ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , the discussion above indicates that , if one wants to accommodate both massless and massive theories , it is more natural to work in the affine setting . moreover , we will see here that working with the affine hypersurfaces is better also from the point of view of having motivic feynman rules .",

    "in particular , an algebro - geometric feynman rule defines a ring homomorphism @xmath129 as in definition [ feyruledef ] , by interpreting a monomial @xmath94 as the disjoint union @xmath95 . in the motivic case",
    "this homomorphism factors through the commutative ring @xmath128 .",

    "it will be then be clear from lemma [ projaff ] that , unlike the case of general feynman rules , the second property @xmath124 in definition [ agfeynrules ] will in fact be a consequence of the multiplicativity @xmath122 over disjoint unions @xmath121 , together with the fact that the hypersurface complement does not distinguish between the case of the disjoint union @xmath121 and the case where the graphs @xmath131 and @xmath132 are joined at a single vertex .",
    "notice , moreover , that there are examples of combinatorially inequivalent connected 1pi graphs that have the same graph hypersurface , so that one can construct feynman rules that are not algebro - geometric or motivic , by assigning different invariants to such graphs , so that the resulting ring homomorphism @xmath133 does not factor through @xmath46 or through the ring @xmath42 described in  [ univsec ] below .",
