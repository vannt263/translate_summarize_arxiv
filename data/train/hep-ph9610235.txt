    "<S> we concentrate on a highly predictive one - parameter no - scale supergravity model @xcite that realizes the light - gravitino scenario advocated previously as an explanation for the cdf event @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the generic experimental signature for this model is @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of observed photons may be n=0 in the case of gravitino pair production , n=1 in the case of gravitino - neutralino production , n=2 in the case of neutralino - neutralino production , and generally n = even ( odd ) if an even ( odd ) number of gravitinos and/or neutralinos are produced . </S>",
    "<S> the system @xmath9 may be ` nothing ' when only gravitinos and/or neutralinos are produced , but it may include visible particles when heavier supersymmetric particles are produced , as in the case of the cdf event , where @xmath10 and n=2 .    in the context of lep , the kinematically most accessible signals correspond to @xmath9=nothing and n=@xmath11 , which result from gravitino - neutralino production ( @xmath12 ) and neutralino - neutralino production ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as of the end of lep161 running , there are no reported excesses in the single - photon cross section . </S>",
    "<S> there exist however interesting acoplanar diphoton events , at least in the opal data sample taken at @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) @xcite and the l3 data sample at @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) @xcite . in view of this situation </S>",
    "<S> , one may presume that single - photon events are not being observed , while diphoton events may be starting to show up . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is in fact one of two mutually exclusive ones ( the other being the converse ) , as we have recently demonstrated in the context of general light - gravitino models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this dichotomy is possible , in spite of the ample kinematical accessibility of the single - photon process ( @xmath17 ) , because the single - photon cross section can be suppressed below the 0.1  pb level by choosing a suitable gravitino mass ( @xmath18 ) , while the diphoton cross section remains unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> further support for this scenario may come from lep runs at higher center - of - mass energies .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start by displaying in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n1n1-updated ] the diphoton cross section as a function of the neutralino mass for various lep center - of - mass energies , where we have made use of the result @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to realize that , besides the neutralino mass ( @xmath20 ) , this cross section also depends on the neutralino composition and the selectron masses ( @xmath21 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these additional variables are not independent parameters in the model , but instead vary continously with @xmath20 : @xmath22 , while the neutralino approaches a pure bino composition at high neutralino masses . </S>",
    "<S> ( the dependence of the diphoton cross section for generic values of the parameters is studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> there have been several upper limits imposed on the diphoton cross section by the various lep collaborations at lep  1.5 @xcite and lep161 energies @xcite . of these the preliminary aleph and opal lep161 upper limits of @xmath23 ( obtained with @xmath24 @xcite ) are most constraining in our model . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n1n1-updated ] shows that @xmath25 is required . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding diphoton limits from lep  1 are not available , and in any event would imply @xmath26 at best , a sensitivity already surpassed at lep161 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the analysis of the three acoplanar diphoton events that have been observed to have characteristics not fit well by the expected @xmath27 background . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , the missing invariant mass @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) is peaked around @xmath31 for the background , whereas it has no particular structure for the diphoton signal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematical information on the three events is listed in table  [ table1 ] , from where we can see that @xmath32 is indeed substantially removed from the @xmath33 peak in all cases . </S>",
    "<S> we should remark that we are fully aware that these events may well be due to the expected background @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find it well motivated to seek alternative explanations for these events . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly relevant in the context of the model of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where the diphoton cross section is at the same level as the expected background . </S>",
    "<S> we should add that both opal and l3 have additional acoplanar diphoton events with @xmath34 , which have been disregarded in the present analysis because of their very likely background origin .    </S>",
    "<S> .the kinematical information on the three acoplanar photon pair events observed by opal at lep  1.5 and l3 at lep161 . also shown </S>",
    "<S> is the missing invariant mass @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> all momenta , masses , and energies in gev , angles in radians . [ cols=\"<,^,^,>,>,>,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ' '' ''    assuming that these diphoton events are the result of the underlying @xmath35 process , one can perform a monte carlo simulation of the unseen momenta ( that of the two gravitinos ) and obtain distributions of neutralino masses that are consistent with the kinematics of the events . </S>",
    "<S> essentially one varies the 3 components of one of the gravitino 3-momenta and obtains the neutralino mass . </S>",
    "<S> momentum conservation determines the other gravitino 3-momentum and energy conservation determines its energy . demanding an essentially massless gravitino gives a constraint , as does the requirement that the second neutralino reconstruct to the same mass as the first neutralino . </S>",
    "<S> altogether one is left with a single free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure has been described in detail in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that energy and momentum conservation in the events restrict the range of possible neutralino masses to : @xmath36 given the above lower limit on the neutralino mass from direct searches ( @xmath25 ) it appears unlikely that the opal and l3b events may be of neutralino origin .    </S>",
    "<S> more information , although of a statistical nature , can be obtained by examining the distributions of neutralino masses that are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> these are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bins - updated ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( the distribution upper and lower limits agree with those in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : opal],[eq : l3a],[eq : l3b ] ) . ) </S>",
    "<S> let us first note the distinct preference for neutralino masses near the upper limit of the allowed mass range . </S>",
    "<S> the figure makes it also apparent that a common source for these events is not inconceivable , and in fact quite natural at around @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as noted above , the lower limit on the neutralino mass seemingly forces us to disregard the opal and l3b events . we should point out that the neutralino mass range allowed in the l3a event is subject to some uncertainty that will broaden the distribution somewhat . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the neutralino masses need not be exactly the same on account of the finite neutralino width or because near threshold one neutralino may be produced off - shell . </S>",
    "<S> also , the experimental momenta used in our calculations have some uncertainties that are not available and have not been accounted for in our simulation . to be conservative </S>",
    "<S> one may speculate that neutralino masses above 60 gev , and as high as 70 gev may be consistent with the data . clearly more data are needed to reach a more definitive conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the rates for these events . </S>",
    "<S> the opal event was observed at @xmath13 in @xmath38 of data . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for @xmath39 is @xmath40 , entailing @xmath41 expected events  not inconsistent with observations except for the direct mass limit . </S>",
    "<S> the l3 events were observed at @xmath15 in @xmath16 of data . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for @xmath42 is @xmath43 , entailing @xmath44 expected events respectively  seemingly preferring the upper end of the allowed neutralino mass range . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the signal cross section is at the same level as the expected standard model background .    for future reference </S>",
    "<S> , we have also calculated the diphoton cross section as a function of the center - of - mass energy , for selected neutralino masses , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : varyroots ] . for instance , </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath45 , the cross section increases from 0.51  pb to 0.61  pb when going from @xmath15 up to @xmath46 , a 20% increase . </S>",
    "<S> kinematically speaking , the photon energies in the diphoton events are restricted to the range @xmath47 , with @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found it useful to display the kinematical information of the diphoton events in the backdrop of these ranges of photonic energies as a function of @xmath49 , for fixed values of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this plot is shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : gammas - updated ] , where the opal and l3 events are indicated . from the plot one can read off the maximum neutralino masses that are consistent with the kinematics , in agreement with eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : opal],[eq : l3a ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the range in the l3b event is more restrictive than this plot would imply ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : l3b ] ) ) because momentum conservation is quite restrictive in this case , whereas fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gammas - updated ] only includes energy conservation . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully future interesting acoplanar diphoton events will fall in this plot forming a coherent pattern . </S>",
    "<S> we should emphasize that the results in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bins - updated ] and [ fig : gammas - updated ] are model - independent consequences of the kinematics of the events , whereas figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n1n1-updated ] and [ fig : varyroots ] are dynamical predictions valid only in our present model .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider the overlap between the region of parameter space apparently preferred by the lep diphoton events ( _ i.e. _ , the l3a event ) with that consistent with an explanation for the cdf @xmath2 event . </S>",
    "<S> this event may be explained as selectron pair production ( @xmath50 ) , in which case @xmath51 appears required @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the event may be explained as chargino pair - production ( @xmath52 ) , in which case @xmath53 appears required @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the parameter space preferred by the diphoton event , when relaxed somewhat to account for the possible uncertainties ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath1 ) appears consistent with both interpretations of the cdf event . </S>",
    "<S> the region of parameter space apparently singled out by lep corresponds to @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the selectron cross section at the tevatron in the selected selectron mass range is @xmath56@xmath57 @xcite , consistent with observations . in the chargino interpretation </S>",
    "<S> there are many additional processes that one has to contend with @xcite , and a detailed experimental analysis of the detection efficiencies needs to be performed . </S>",
    "<S> we can ascertain though that the total diphoton plus @xmath58 signal from such sources is @xmath59@xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this signal however receives a significant contribution from the process @xmath61 , which is not likely to have a high detection efficiency , as earlier studies involving traditional supersymmetric trilepton searches have shown @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first searches for such inclusive signal at cdf have recently been reported @xcite , although no explicit limits have yet been released .    </S>",
    "<S> we look forward to runs at lep  2 with increased statistics and/or larger center - of - mass energies , as they would have to yield many acoplanar diphoton events should this model describe nature . </S>"
