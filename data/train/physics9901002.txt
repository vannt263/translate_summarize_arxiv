    "noise induced jumping between meta - stable states separated by potential barriers is common in physical systems .",
    "the time scale for the barrier penetration depends on the structure of the noise .",

    "the second moment exists and by the central limit theorem the random walker reduces in the continuum limit to a gaussian random walker unless the diffusion takes place on a fractal set like in a quenched random medium @xcite . in this case",
    "the random walk can be sub - diffusive .",
    "another example of a process which can be sub - diffusive is the levy walk where a random walker has a constant speed in between discrete stochastic time points ( a renewal process ) with a power - function tail distribution .",
    "note that since the time process is discrete for a levy walk it can not result from a langevin equation .",
    "anomalous diffusion was first observed in hydrological time - series @xcite .",
    "recently evidence for @xmath0-stable statistics in atmospheric circulation data has been reported @xcite . in a long paleoclimatic time - series an @xmath0-stable noise induced jumping in a double - well potential",
    "was found @xcite . in both cases @xmath0 was found to be around 1.7 .",
    "the latter describes a jumping , in glacial times , between two climatic states governed by the oceanic flow forced by random fluctuations from the atmosphere . understanding the role of extreme events and the time - scales for these climatic shifts is the main motivation for this study .    in this paper",

    "the levy decomposition theorem @xcite states that the @xmath0-stable process can be decomposed in a brownian process and a compound poisson process . the continuous barrier penetration can be estimated by considering the distribution to be truncated so that there are no jumps larger than the half - width of the barrier , @xmath109 . the truncated probability for the noise , @xmath116 , is then defined by @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",

    "so the relative importance of extremal jumping depends both on the height and the width of the barrier . to illustrate the relative importance of two jumping processes a simulation of ( [ le ] ) with an @xmath0-stable noise @xcite with @xmath127 and a potential ( [ potential ] ) with @xmath128 ,",

    "figure 6 shows part of a realization of this process . here",
    "it is seen that the jumping from the deep to the shallow well is governed by the discontinuous part , @xmath129 , while the jumping from the shallow to the deep well is dominated by the continuous part , @xmath130 . for proportioning the continuous and discontinuous processes in a given situation the prefactor and the constant , @xmath126 , in ( [ tt ] ) must be calculated or estimated .",
    "we have seen that the statistics of noise induced jumping between meta - stable states in a potential is different for @xmath0-stable noise from the usual gaussian noise case .",
    "the stationary probability distribution deviates from the gibbs distribution , and the waiting time for jumping depends in some cases more on the width than on the height of the barrier .",
    "this is the case where a single extreme event triggers the jumping .",
    "these observations might be of importance for understanding the triggering mechanisms of climatic changes , where the flow state of the ocean is trapped in a potential minimum , a stable climatic state .",
    "this flow is stochastically forced by the atmospheric flow .",
    "there are some evidence that this stochastic forcing is @xmath0-stable rather than gaussian such that climatic shifts from one state to another could be triggered by single extreme events .",
    "this would perhaps explain why the climate models at present are not capable of reproducing the climatic changes observed in the geological records .",
    "the models are too coarse grained and contains to much diffusive smoothening to allow for extreme events .",
