    "since the distribution of dense peaks collapsing out of an evolving gaussian density field is well constrained @xcite , bright csr sources are expected to be rare",
    ". these will be difficult to find even with well optimized wide - field surveys which exploit large pixels ( @xmath120.1 ) .",
    "however , the number of detectable sources above a given flux level at a fixed epoch is more uncertain .",
    "this requires a detailed understanding of how and when @xmath1  emission is produced , and how it manages to escape its immediate environment @xcite .",
    "even the most optimistic calculations @xcite show that @xmath1detections will be a major observational challenge on 8  10 m telescopes .",
    "the possible discovery of a lensed candidate galaxy at @xmath13 by @xcite demonstrates the power of lensing to extend our observational reach .",
    "however , the total number of sources accessible this way is limited by the small total volume of the universe that is strongly magnified by foreground lenses .    during the dark ages ,",
    "gas accretion onto protogalactic cores must have been well under way .",
    "galactic nuclei at the highest redshifts observed to date ( @xmath14 ) exhibit solar metallicities , and therefore appear to have undergone many cycles of star formation @xcite .",
    "most galaxy cores early in their evolution must have experienced starburst - driven winds .",
    "early protogalactic winds will have carried large amounts of energy , with relatively low dust / metal content , away from the complex circumnuclear environment @xcite .    in order to understand physical processes associated with the first sources",
    ", we will need to resolve the @xmath1  structures .",
    "but , as we now show , detecting emission powered by outflows is a different experimental challenge from that posed by wide - field searches .",
    "the difficulty of detecting @xmath1  during the dark ages is emphasized in recent simulations by the galform consortium @xcite .",
    "the galform simulations assume that all @xmath1  is produced by star formation , and that 10% escapes through the action of galactic winds .",
    "the simulations are adjusted so as to reproduce the lyman - break and submillimetre galaxy number counts at presently observed wavelengths . down to a limiting flux magnitude of @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 , they predict only about ten sources per square arcmin will be observable across the _ entire _ redshift range corresponding to the j band .",
    "the flux limit is equivalent to a star formation rate of a few solar masses per year which is easily high enough to drive large - scale winds @xcite .",
    "the most efficient mechanism for @xmath1  escape is scattering by neutral h entrained in an outflowing wind @xcite . the best observed starburst galaxy m82 reveals uv - scattered bicones along the minor axis @xcite on a scale of 500 pc to 1 kpc .",
    "this corresponds to a spatial scale of 0.1  0.2  at @xmath20 .",
    "thus wide - field searches of rare massive haloes will need to exploit pixels on this scale in order to find csr sources .",
    "the scattering wind may be clumped but , as we discuss below , the individual clumps are likely to fall below the detection limit .",
    "we now examine the likelihood that most of the @xmath1  is distributed in small clumps which are cooling out of dissipating gas , and spread over a larger volume than @xmath1  arising directly from star forming regions .    during the early stages of galaxy formation , collapse is likely to be comparable to star formation as a source of energy for the gas .",
    "cold gas accumulated in the collapse of a small halo @xcite produces an initial burst of star formation .",
    "if the energy released into the nascent interstellar medium by star formation greatly exceeded that released in the collapse , then the bulk of the gas would be unbound from the young galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , the mechanical energy required to limit the initial burst of star formation is comparable to the binding energy of the gas , which is roughly the energy needed to significantly rearrange gas within a galaxy .",
    "thus , if the burst of star formation is self - limiting , its feedback can not fall well short of the binding energy of the gas , _",
    "i.e. , _  the energy released by the collapse .",
    "since radiative cooling times of gas at the virial temperature are much shorter than dynamical times in low mass protogalaxies , feedback can only be stored briefly as thermal energy .",
    "energy rapidly lost to radiation is ineffective as feedback .",
    "only feedback energy that is converted to kinetic ( and later potential ) energy can be effective in limiting star formation on the dynamical timescale .",
    "effective feedback needs to induce rapid large - scale flows , _",
    "i.e.,_winds , so we assume that the primary channel of feedback is through winds .",
    "this argument requires a moderately high efficiency for the conversion of energy released by star formation into wind energy , but that is consistent with observations of starburst winds ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if collapse and the initial burst of star formation make comparable energy inputs to the ism , we can estimate both using the spherical collapse model . to form a disk ,",
    "gas must dissipate at least the vertical component of its velocity dispersion , _",
    "@xmath21 per unit mass . for a dissipative collapse",
    " one producing cold gas  the energy dissipated is several times this , so we use the estimate of @xmath22 per unit mass dissipated by gas in the collapse .",
    "the time taken for a halo to virialize is roughly equal to its turn around time , _",
    "i.e. , _  half of its collapse time , @xmath23 . if the energy dissipated in the collapse is dissipated in half of the virialization time , the dissipation rate @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the gas mass involved in the collapse .",
    "dark energy is insignificant for collapse at @xmath26 , so that the mean density of a halo collapsing at @xmath23 is @xmath27 , giving the virial radius for a halo of mass @xmath28 as @xmath29^{1/3}$ ] . treating the halo as an isothermal sphere ( @xmath30 ) , then gives @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 , where the halo mass @xmath33 and @xmath34 yr [ z = 8 , in @xmath35cdm with @xmath36 .",
    "little @xmath1  can be produced in the collapse unless the gas is heated over @xmath37 k , _",
    "i.e.,_unless @xmath38 , requiring halo masses exceeding @xmath39 .    using the baryon fraction determined by wmap ( @xmath40 ; *",
    "* ) and assuming that all baryons are gaseous in the collapse , the dissipation rate in the gas during a collapse is @xmath41 .",
    "instantaneous dissipation rates will show a significant spread about this value .",
    "the fraction emerging as @xmath1  photons depends on the shock temperature and the fraction of photons that escape .",
    "higher escape fractions are favoured by low optical depth and low abundances ( low dust content ) .",
    "in standard @xmath35cdm , very few @xmath42 m@xmath43 halos collapse before z = 8 @xcite .    while the fraction of @xmath1  photons escaping from starbursts is small , a significant part of the energy carried off by galactic winds is ultimately likely to be dissipated in shocks .",
    "these are another potential source of @xmath1  photons and , from above , the energy in the winds is comparable to that dissipated in the collapse .",
    "the winds effectively carry energy from the dense , dusty environment of a starburst into lower density regions , where the escape probability for @xmath1  photons is greater .",
    "starburst wind speeds are high and not strongly dependent on the properties of the hosting halo .",
    "this means that if starbursts are triggered in halos smaller than @xmath44 , then the terminating shocks of galactic winds may produce @xmath1although the collapse shocks can not .    from above , the mean baryon density in a dissipationless halo collapsing at @xmath45 is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mass of hydrogen .",
    "since dissipation significantly increases the density of the gas , the typical density of gas running into shocks during a dissipative collapse can be somewhat larger than this .",
    "the collapse is fairly chaotic and collapsing gas is likely to encounter several shocks before finally reaching its destination .",
    "provided that the effects of radiation transfer are not too significant , the depth of the emitting region behind a radiative shock is approximately equal to the product of the postshock cooling time and velocity . in a strong shock ,",
    "the gas density is increased by a factor of 4 , the speed is decreased by the same factor and the postshock temperature is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the shock speed and @xmath50 is the mean mass per particle . fig .",
    "1 shows the width of the postshock cooling region for a preshock electron density of @xmath51 , for metal abundances of 0 , 0.1 and 1 solar .",
    "initially , the collapsing gas flow may be coherent on larger scales than the postshock cooling length in fig .  1 .",
    "in that case , cooling shocked regions are sheetlike and emission is brightest at caustics where we see folds in these sheets projected onto the sky .",
    "the cooling gas is subject to thermal and other instabilities that will generally cause it to fragment on about the scale of the cooling length .",
    "( the flow into any further shocks is likely to be considerably more chaotic . ) for haloes in the mass range of interest , the shock speeds in the collapse are , at most , 100  200 @xmath52 . in a pristine gas ,",
    "the inferred size of cooling clumps is roughly 100  pc , or 0.02  at a redshift of @xmath20 .",
    "the small size of the cooling region demands an infrared imager which utilizes small pixels ( @xmath7 ) and adaptive optics correction .",
    "however , we point out that rapid winds from starbursts can produce significantly larger cooling regions .    since gas",
    "is compressed significantly in a dissipative collapse , the time scale for star formation in a clump of collapsed gas can be much shorter than the dynamical time of the collapsing system ( @xmath53 yr ) .",
    "massive stars take only @xmath54 yr to produce supernovae , giving plenty of time for starbursts and their winds to get underway while other gas continues to collapse into the system .",
    "interaction between infalling gas and starburst winds can lead to further shocking of both .",
    "this process is observed in m82 where the outflowing starburst - driven wind impinges directly on infalling gas at a radius of 11  kpc @xcite producing observable @xmath55  and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "we now examine whether wind - powered @xmath1  emission in small clumps can be detected with an 8 m telescope using an adaptive optics imager with small pixels ( 0.02 \" ) .",
    "we assume that the total energy released in @xmath1  at a fixed star formation rate is comparable to what is generated in large - scale shocks driven by the starburst , and that this emission escapes without attenuation .",
    "as discussed in  2.2 , this assumes a high conversion rate of the supernova energy into wind energy ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from surveys of nearby dwarf galaxies",
    "@xcite , we adopt a wind radius of 5  kpc . at @xmath20 ,",
    "the shock occurs at 1radius and is barely resolved .",
    "naively , if the wind energy escapes along bipolar cones , the @xmath1  surface brightness will be increased by the decrease in solid angle compared to a spherical wind .",
    "this factor can be @xmath56 since most winds appear to be highly collimated @xcite .",
    "however , this factor does not apply to a comparison with the expected flux from a csr , since the normal assumption is that the collimated wind material is what renders the central source visible .",
    "an escape fraction of 10% assumed in the galform simulations is the fraction of radiation which escapes along the bicones multiplied by the fraction scattered in the wind .    for wind - induced emission , in our model",
    ", the total power available is @xmath57 but this is now spread over many more pixels .",
    "the surface brightness of the shock induced @xmath1  emission depends critically on how the bipolar shock surfaces are oriented with respect to the observer .",
    "if the bipolar wind lies in the plane of the sky , most of the emission is confined to limb - brightened arcs over an area of @xmath58 pixels depending on the curvature of the shock surface .",
    "if the bipolar wind is directed at the observer , the projected radius of the shocked - induced nebula is half the intrinsic radius ( @xmath59 opening angle ) .",
    "thus , the flux is now dispersed over an area of @xmath60 pixels .",
    "our expectation is that the @xmath1  flux _ per pixel _ will be an order of magnitude fainter in external large - scale shocks ( els ) compared to csr emission in a large pixel survey ( 0.1 \" ) .",
    "we believe that it will be important to reach this flux level if we are to understand the nature and origin of the @xmath1  emission .",
    "we have assumed that essentially all of the @xmath1  emission escapes its environs since it is produced _ in situ_. but in the presence of any diffuse intergalactic hi component at rest with the expanding universe , the shock surface must have a sufficient redshift in order for the @xmath1  emission to escape to the observer .    we have already noted that csr emission is rendered visible through scattering by neutral h in the wind . from the local universe , we know that winds arise from highly inhomogeneous starburst cores and entrain most of their mass from cooler material in the surrounding disk @xcite .",
    "thus the scattering medium is likely to be highly clumped .",
    "however , since the total escaping @xmath1  flux in our model is @xmath61 , these scattering clumps are likely to be an order of magnitude fainter than self - illuminating clumps of shocked gas induced by the same wind .",

    "<S> most direct source detections beyond @xmath0 are likely to arise from wide - field narrowband surveys of @xmath1  emission in the j band . for this to be true , </S>",

    "<S> since the @xmath1  escape fraction is @xmath2% from an emitting region of size @xmath3 kpc , these objects will be difficult to find and hard to detect , requiring @xmath4  100 hours at each telescope pointing on 8  10 m telescopes . for csr sources , </S>",
    "<S> existing large - format ir arrays are close to ideal in terms of their noise characteristics for conducting _ wide - field _ narrowband surveys where pixel sizes are 0.1  or larger .    </S>",

    "<S> the winds effectively carry energy from the dense , dusty environment of a starburst into lower density regions , where the escape probability for @xmath1  photons is greater . </S>",
    "<S> els emission is expected to be considerably more clumpy ( @xmath5 pc ) than csr emission . for els sources </S>",
    "<S> , ir arrays will need @xmath6 orders of magnitude improvement in dark current in order to detect dispersed clumpy emission within the environments of massive haloes . </S>",
    "<S> these sources require an ir camera with small pixels ( @xmath7 ) and adaptive optics correction ( _ e.g. , _  </S>",
