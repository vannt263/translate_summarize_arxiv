    "the recent detection of c@xmath0h@xmath1 in the carbon - rich agb star and the cold , dense interstellar cloud by @xcite with abundance ratios relative to c@xmath0h of 0.010.1 indicates that anions may play a more significant role in interstellar physics and chemistry than heretofore believed .    the possibility that a relatively large fraction of molecular material in interstellar clouds might be in the form of anions",
    "was first suggested by @xcite who pointed out that carbon chain molecules and other radicals have large electron affinities , leading to high radiative attachment rates such as those measured by @xcite with the attendant possibility of anion / neutral fractions on the order of a few percent .",
    "more recently , it has been recognized that pah anions could soak up a significant fraction of the free electrons in interstellar clouds and alter the charge balance to a significant degree @xcite as well as providing significant heating through photodetachment of electrons in diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite has investigated the synthesis of cn@xmath1 by the dissociative attachment of mgcn and mgnc and other mechanisms , while @xcite showed that c@xmath5n@xmath1 could be detectable in interstellar clouds .",
    "the study of large hydrocarbons anions received some attention following the observation by @xcite that absorption bands in several carbon - chain anions coincided with several of the diffuse interstellar bands .",
    "subsequently , the formation of such species in diffuse clouds was studied by @xcite who showed , in particular , that c@xmath6 was unlikely to be a source for any dibs . @xcite",
    "considered the formation of hydrocarbon anions containing more than six carbon atoms in the carbon - rich circumstellar envelope of and showed that appreciable column densities could arise in the outer envelope .",
    "the basic route to the formation of anions is electron radiative attachment : @xmath7 which has been discussed in the context of bare carbon chains by @xcite .",
    "the rate coefficients of relevant processes have not been experimentally determined at low temperatures and in this work we have used phase - state theory assuming @xmath8-wave attachment with radiative stabilisation occurring by vibrational and electronic transitions @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : rates ] contains some relevant attachment rate coefficients .",
    "the calculations of rates for these and other processes will be discussed in a separate paper ( herbst , in preparation ) . for c@xmath9h radicals , we find that radiative attachment occurs at the collisional rate once the number of carbon atoms is larger than five ; for c@xmath10h , the attachment efficiency is only around 1% .",
    "@xcite have shown experimentally that neither carbon - chain anions nor hydrocarbon anions react with h@xmath11 but do so with h atoms .",
    "we have also included loss reactions of anions with c , c@xmath12 , c@xmath11h@xmath13 ( in irc+10216 ) , and photons , with all cation - anion rate coefficients taken to be 10@xmath14 @xmath15 s@xmath16 .",
    "for the photodetachment rates , some of which are shown in table [ tab : rates ] , we have assumed the cross section @xmath17 to depend on photon energy @xmath18 via the relation @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the electron affinity of the neutral molecule .",
    "relevant electron affinities have been obtained from theoretical and experimental results ( herbst , in preparation ) .",
    "the uv radiation field as described by @xcite has been adopted .",
    "we have extended earlier models such as that by @xcite , which included c@xmath23 , @xmath24 = 723 , and by @xcite , which included c@xmath25h@xmath1 , @xmath24 = 723 , down to anions containing four carbon atoms following the determination of the microwave spectrum of c@xmath10h@xmath1 by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the reactions discussed above , we have included in the cse and pdr models radiative association between carbon - chain anions and neutrals leading to carbon chains of up to 23 carbon atoms @xcite , while in the dark cloud models we have included reactions between anions and o atoms , with a rate coefficient of 10@xmath26 @xmath15 s@xmath16 , unless specifically measured ( eichelberger et al .",
    "we model the carbon - rich agb star irc+10216 using the numerical model developed by @xcite and @xcite . they modelled the formation of anions with more than six carbon atoms and showed that the anion radial distribution could extend beyond 10@xmath27 cm and relative to their neutral analogues",
    ", abundance ratios approaching 0.1 ( for c@xmath6 , for example ) could be achieved .",
    "some results of our present calculation in which we have extended our species down to c@xmath10h@xmath1 are shown in table [ tab : cse ] and figure [ fig : cse ] .",
    "our results show that column densities of @xmath28 @xmath29 for c@xmath10h@xmath1 to @xmath30 @xmath29 for c@xmath31h@xmath3 are achievable , with anion - to - neutral column density ratios of 0.008 for c@xmath10h to around 0.30.4 for c@xmath0h , c@xmath4h and c@xmath31h .",
    "note that although the electron attachment efficiency for c@xmath10h is only around 1% that of c@xmath0h and c@xmath4h , c@xmath10h@xmath1 has a relatively large column density since c@xmath10h is more abundant .",
    "both c@xmath10h@xmath1 and c@xmath4h@xmath1 are candidates for detection in irc+10216 . in the region interior to a radial distance of @xmath32 cm ,",
    "the main loss of anions occurs through reaction with h atoms , while mutual neutralisation with c@xmath12 dominates in @xmath33 cm .",
    "elsewhere photodetachment is the major loss route .",
    "@xcite measured a c@xmath0h@xmath1 column density of @xmath34 @xmath29 , approximately 60 times less than is produced in our model .",
    "although the column density is over - produced , it is important to note that the column densities of the large hydrocarbon chains are very sensitive to the initial abundance of acetylene adopted in the model .",
    "this results from the fact that the most efficient method of growth is via the addition of c@xmath11 units .",
    "for example , if the initial abundance of c@xmath11h@xmath11 is reduced by five , the column density of c@xmath0h is reduced by about 45 and that of c@xmath31h by 100 .",
    "the anion column densities are not affected as much , typically reducing by about an order of magnitude , since less acetylene also leads to a reduction in the abundances of h atoms and c@xmath12 in the envelope .",
    "the observed anion - to - neutral ratio is 0.010.1 where the range is due to the range of reported c@xmath0h column densities @xcite , but is in reasonable agreement with the calculated value of 0.3 , given the uncertainties in the rates of anion formation ( by radiative electron attachment ) , and destruction .",
    "finally we note that the anion abundances can be greater than that of free electrons in the region around @xmath35 cm .",
    "this reflects the efficiency of carbon - chain growth and electron attachment .",
    "a similar result is found in dark cloud models when pahs are included @xcite .      here",
    "we adopt parameters applicable to the cold dust cloud tmc-1 ( @xmath36 @xmath37 , t = 10 k , a@xmath38 = 10 mag . ) and perform quasi - time - dependent modeling .",
    "the initial elemental abundances of c , n and o relative to h are @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : tmc1 ] shows the time - dependent evolution of the fractional abundances ( with respect to h@xmath42 ) of c@xmath2h@xmath3 and c@xmath43h@xmath3 and their corresponding neutrals from @xmath44 yr while table  [ tab : tmc1 ] and table  [ tab : tmc2 ] present anion column densities and anion / neutral ratios respectively , at both early - time ( @xmath45 yr ) and steady state ( @xmath46 yr ) .",
    "we adopt n(h@xmath11 ) = 10@xmath47 @xmath29 in calculating the molecular column densities .",
    "steady - state abundances are very low due to the incorporation of carbon into co but much better agreement occurs at earlier times in the evolution .",
    "the column density of c@xmath0h@xmath1 produced in our model at early time ( @xmath45 yr ) , @xmath48 @xmath29 , is very close to that observed by @xcite , @xmath49 @xmath29 .",
    "we calculate the column density of the neutral c@xmath0h at early time to be @xmath50 @xmath29 , which is in good agreement with the observed value of @xmath51 @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the observed anion - to - neutral ratio is 0.025 , which is in very good agreement with the calculated early - time value of 0.052 , given the uncertainties in assorted rate coefficients .      we have used the code developed by the meudon group @xcite with the additional hydrocarbon chemistry described above . for this model",
    "we assume a fixed temperature of 50  k and parameters representative of those in the horsehead nebula ; i.e. , g = 60g@xmath52 , where g@xmath52 is the interstellar uv radiation field , a@xmath53 = 10 mag .",
    "to the cloud center , and a total hydrogen density of @xmath54 @xmath37 .",
    "these models are steady - state , which is achieved rapidly due to the enhanced uv field and fast photodestruction rates .",
    "the pdr models show that the anionic species formed can survive exposure to a high radiation field present in regions such as the horsehead nebula because , given the high electron abundance , the formation path of electron attachment is efficient enough to overcome the rapid photodetechment of the fragile anions .",
    "this high electron abundance at low to intermediate extinction can be inferred from the c@xmath12 abundance in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdr ] , which also shows that significant abundances of the anions arise at low extinction ( a@xmath53 @xmath55 1.53 mag . ) . at low a@xmath53 , @xmath55 0.52 mag .",
    ", the dominant loss of anions is through mutual neutralisation with c@xmath12 ( and to a lesser extent through reactions with atomic hydrogen ) .",
    "thus , since n(c@xmath12 ) = n(e ) in this region , the anion / neutral abundance ratio depends on the ratio of the rate coefficients for electron attachment and mutual neutralisation . for species with more than five carbon atoms , this leads to abundance ratios greater than unity ; for smaller species , the ratio is less than one .",
    "in fact , the abundances of the anions are , in some cases , larger than the neutral species .",
    "relevant results are listed in table  [ tab : pdr ] .",
    "most notably , c@xmath4h@xmath1 and c@xmath31h@xmath1 are more dominant than the neutral species with fractional abundances over an order of magnitude greater than those of c@xmath4h and c@xmath31h .",
    "since the pdr model provides abundances perpendicular to the line - of - sight for a pdr seen edge on , as is the case for the horsehead nebula , it is more appropriate to compare fractional abundances rather than column densities .",
    "the peak abundance of c@xmath10h is consistent with observations of the horsehead region made by @xcite .",
    "although the relative abundance of c@xmath10h@xmath1 ( 3.5% ) to its neutral analog is not as high as c@xmath0h@xmath1 or c@xmath4h@xmath1 , the higher abundance of the neutral species allows a significantly large absolute value of this anion to be formed .",
    "the c@xmath0h@xmath1 anion has a peak abundance of 4.7 times that of the neutral species .",
    "the detection of c@xmath0h in the horsehead nebula was reported by @xcite , who calculated a peak abundance relative to h@xmath11 of @xmath56 , about one order of magnitude greater than calculated .",
    "it is possible that we are missing an important formation mechanism in this environment .",
    "one possibility is that hydrocarbon abundances are boosted by destruction of pah particles , rather than being synthesized from smaller species . in any case , our anion / neutral ratios are independent of the mode of formation of the neutral .",
    "we find that electron attachment to hydrocarbon molecules is very efficient for species containing more than five carbon atoms .",
    "the anions are created so efficiently that they can be abundant even in regions where they are destroyed rapidly by photons , such as cses and pdrs , and in dark clouds , despite the low fractional abundance of electrons . in particular",
    ", we find that anions such as c@xmath0h@xmath1 , c@xmath4h@xmath1 and c@xmath31h@xmath1 can have abundances relative to their neutral analogs ranging from a few percent to greater than unity , while c@xmath10h@xmath1 , although formed relatively inefficiently through electron attachment , can be observable in astronomical objects , given the large column densities of c@xmath10h detected .",
    "in fact , as this paper was being prepared , we became aware of a preprint by cernicharo et al .",
    "in which the detection of c@xmath2h@xmath3 in irc+10216 is reported with a c@xmath10h@xmath1/c@xmath0h@xmath1 column density ratio of 1/7 , compared to our calculated value of 1/17 .",
