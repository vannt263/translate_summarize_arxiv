    ", a split degree two del pezzo surface @xmath16 can be thought of as the blow - up of the plane at seven points in general position or a degree four hypersurface in weighted projective space @xmath17 .",
    "the weighted projective space we are considering has variables @xmath46 where the @xmath47 is given weight two and the other variables are weight one .",
    "this means for our surface is that we can write @xmath16 as the zero set of an equation of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a homogeneous degree four polynomial in three variables with coefficients in @xmath28 .",

    "if @xmath56 is a line in the plane , then by bezout s theorem @xmath56 intersects @xmath51 at four points counting multiplicity and we write @xmath57 .",
    "the line @xmath56 is _ tangent _ to @xmath51 at a point @xmath58 if we can say @xmath59 .",
    "bitangent _ is a line @xmath56 such that @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "when @xmath56 and @xmath51 intersect only at one point @xmath58 we call that point a _ hyperflex_. over a field of characteristic greater than three , the number of hyperflexes is bounded by 12 @xcite .",
    "there are only two quartic curves with exactly 12 hyperflexes , the fermat quartic defined by @xmath62 and the curve defined by @xmath63 @xcite . over @xmath38 ,",
    "the fermat quartic has 28 hyperflexes .",
    "the fifty - six exceptional curves on @xmath16 come from the twenty - eight bitangents to the quartic curve @xmath51 .",
    "each bitangent to @xmath51 lifts to a pair of exceptional curves in @xmath16 that intersect transversely at two points of @xmath51 or , in the case of a hyperflex , are tangent to each other as pictured below .",
    "since the bitangents to @xmath51 are lying in the plane @xmath6 , each bitangent is guaranteed to intersect each of the other 27 bitangents once .",
    "similarly to the case of cubic surfaces , now up to four bitangents can intersect at once ( * ? ? ? * proof of lemma 4.1 ) .",
    "this corresponds to four of the exceptional curves in @xmath16 intersecting at one point .",
    "we call such a point in @xmath16 a _ generalized eckardt point_. as with cubic surfaces , a point on @xmath16 where three exceptional curves meet is called an eckardt point . in order to find a formula for @xmath64 similar to hirschfeld s formula for @xmath65 we need to establish a notation for the points on the bitangent lines to @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath66 be a bitangent to @xmath51 for @xmath67 and let : + @xmath68 = number of points on @xmath66 where exactly 4 bitangents meet , + @xmath69 = number of points on @xmath66 where exactly 3 bitangents meet , + @xmath70 = number of points on @xmath66 where exactly 2 bitangents meet , + @xmath71 = number of points on @xmath66 that are not on any other bitangents , + @xmath72= number of times @xmath66 intersects @xmath51 over @xmath73 .",

    "+ then , @xmath75 and @xmath76    now let @xmath77 since each @xmath66 will lift to two exceptional curves in @xmath16 that intersect only over @xmath28 points of @xmath51 , we get the formula @xmath78 notice that we do not double count the @xmath79 points because those are places where the map @xmath54 is one - to - one .",
    "also notice that in order for @xmath16 to have a chance at fullness , we need @xmath80 .",
    "we can use equations ( [ line ] ) and ( [ int ] ) to turn ( [ pts ] ) into a formula which depends on only @xmath36 , the number of points on the quartic @xmath51 , and the number of generalized and classical eckardt points . to do this we first manipulate ( [ int ] ) to get the equality @xmath81 which leads to @xmath82 then combining @xmath83 from ( [ line ] ) with ( [ f ] ) we get the following formula for @xmath84 , @xmath85 using equations ( [ f ] ) and ( [ g ] ) to eliminate the @xmath86 and @xmath84 in ( [ full ] ) yields the desired formula @xmath87    in order for @xmath16 to be full",
    ", the equation @xmath88 must be satisfied . or we can solve @xmath89    full degree two del pezzo surfaces can only exist over @xmath73 when @xmath37 .    in order to find a lower bound for the size of the field",
    ", we must find the smallest field in which a degree two del pezzo can split .",
    "we discover this bound by looking at how the bitangents of a quartic plane curve intersect .",
    "since each of the bitangents must intersect the 27 others and at most four can intersect simultaneously , each bitangent must contain at least 9 points .",
    "the number of points on a line defined over @xmath28 is @xmath90 , hence @xmath91    the upper bound is found by analyzing equation ( [ full ] ) .",
    "there are at most 126 generalized eckardt points on a degree two del pezzo surface since each bitangent line contains at most @xmath92 of them .",
    "hence , @xmath93 there are also at most 242 eckardt points on a degree 2 del pezzo surface since each bitangent can contain at most 13 eckardt points and not all 28 of them can .",
    "even so , assuming all 28 lines contain 13 eckardt points yields @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we can see that the maximum value for the right hand side of ( [ full ] ) is 253 when @xmath95 . in order to maximize the @xmath36 on the left hand side of ( [ full ] )",
    ", we can assume that the quartic @xmath51 does not have any @xmath28-rational points .",
    "thus we see that in order for a degree two del pezzo surface defined over @xmath28 to have the possibility of being full , we need @xmath96 or @xmath97 . when @xmath98 , the weil bounds tell us that @xmath51 will contain at least 2 and at most 74 rational points , so the case @xmath99 does not apply . in this case",
    "( [ full ] ) becomes @xmath100 .",
    "one solution to this equality is @xmath101 , which we have not yet ruled out as a possibility .",
    "the degree two del pezzo surfaces we experiment with all contain generalized eckardt points . over small finite fields ,",
    "split surfaces always have generalized eckardt points . but",
    "kaplan ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop 76 ) has found two surfaces over @xmath43 that do not contain these points .    over @xmath102 and @xmath103 split degree two del pezzo surfaces",
    "contain generalized eckardt points .    over a field with @xmath36 elements ,",
    "every bitangent to the quartic @xmath51 contains exactly @xmath90 @xmath28-rational points .",
    "when @xmath104 , @xmath105 for each @xmath106 , so @xmath16 contains @xmath107 generalized eckardt points .",
    "when @xmath108 , there are 12 points on each bitangent so @xmath109 for each @xmath67 .",
    "thus @xmath16 contains at least @xmath110 generalized eckardt points .",
    "now suppose by way of contradiction that the size of the ground field is 13 and the del pezzo does not contain any generalized eckardt points .",
    "then , every bitangent to @xmath51 must intersect 2 lines simultaneously at 13 points , @xmath111 for all @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the number of eckardt points on the corresponding del pezzo surface is @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the surface must contain a generalized eckardt point .",
    "one reason we restrict ourselves to surfaces with generalized eckardt points is that over an algebraically closed field , a quartic curve @xmath51 admitting a generalized eckardt point is equivalent to @xmath51 admitting an involution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) .",
    "thus there is nice symmetry between the lines .",
    "kuwata gives explicit equations for the quartic curves which admit a pair of commuting involutions , and these are the surfaces we study @xcite .",
    "let @xmath51 be a quartic plane curve with a pair of commuting involutions . by a change of coordinates , possibly defined over a field extension",
    ", @xmath51 can be defined by an equation of the form @xmath113    kuwata uses the equation above to find a family of quartic curves whose twenty - eight bitangent lines are all defined over the base field which does not need to be algebraically closed .",

    "then we use the equations of the lines to determine the intersection form @xmath121 of each line . with this information",
    ", we are able to find full degree two del pezzo surfaces .",
    "the following section lists the results we were able to find while experimenting with kuwata curves in magma .",
    "another recent result involving degree two del pezzo surfaces with generalized eckardt points is due to salgado , testa , and vrilly - alvarado @xcite .",
    "let @xmath122 be homogeneous polynomials of degrees two and four respectively such that the polynomial @xmath123 has distinct roots .",
    "when the characteristic of the ground field is not two , the surface @xmath16 in the weighted projective space @xmath124 with equation @xmath125 is a smooth del pezzo surface of degree two with an involution given by @xmath126 and contains at least two generalized eckardt points @xmath127 $ ] and @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "in fact , every del pezzo surface of degree two with a point contained in four exceptional curves has an involution and is of the form described above .",
    "in this section we present the results we found using magma and kuwata curves . for each of the finite fields we list the full degree two del pezzo surfaces and how each of the bitangents to the quartic @xmath51 intersects the other bitangents in the form @xmath129 defined above .",
    "our first result on full degree 2 del pezzo surfaces was first found by hirschfeld when he was studying full cubic surfaces@xcite .",

    "this point can be blown - up to create a full degree two del pezzo .    over the field @xmath38 there exists a unique full degree two del pezzo surface up to isomorphism .",
    "it is given by the equation @xmath130 and all of the lines on @xmath0 contain nine generalized eckardt points .",
