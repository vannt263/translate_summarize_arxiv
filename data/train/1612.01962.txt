    "the long exact sequence in homotopy of @xmath223 is short exact at @xmath224 .",

    "however , it follows directly from the gysin sequence of the associated circle bundle , @xmath248 , that @xmath246 is then trivial and thus this case does not occur .",
    "so , we are left with one last case : both @xmath249 and @xmath250 are non - trivial .",

    "since the fixed point set of the @xmath10-action is empty by hypothesis , it follows that @xmath284=0 .",
    "this tells us that @xmath285 and thus @xmath11 has the homology groups of @xmath12 , so by corollary [ wall ] , it follows that @xmath11 is diffeomorphic to @xmath12 .",
