    "to study the statistical property of a complex system composed of many interacting individual components , it is often helpful to map the system into a network of nodes and links ( edges ) .",
    "each node in this network represents one component of the real system and the interaction , if there is any , between two components is denoted by an edge , either directed or undirected , between the two corresponding nodes in the network .",
    "one quantity of interest is the node - degree profile of the formed network : how does @xmath4 , the total number of nodes with a given number @xmath5 of links attached ( the node degree ) , scales with @xmath5 ?",
    "empirical observations revealed that many social and biological networks have the scale - free property @xcite , that is , @xmath6 as @xmath5 becomes large enough .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath7 is typically in the range of @xmath8 ; but there are evidences that some networks have scaling exponents in the range of @xmath0-@xmath1 @xcite while a few other networks have scaling exponents larger than @xmath9 ( for a collection of experimental data , please refer to table ii of @xcite ) .    to explain the scale - free characteristic , one appealing mechanism is to assume that the network ( 1 ) keeps growing and , ( 2 ) during this growth process",
    ", new edges are generated and are attached preferentially to those nodes which have already been attached by a large number of edges @xcite .",
    "based on this mechanism several models have been suggested @xcite , but they predicted the scaling exponent @xmath7 to be greater than @xmath1 , thus failed to explain the behavior of those networks with smaller @xmath7 . in ref .",
    "@xcite this @xmath10preferential attachment  mechanism was questioned partly because of this apparent discrepancy between theory and empirical data . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that if one assumes a network is growing accelerately , it is possible to generate scaling exponent in the range between @xmath11 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is still not clear whether or not this condition is absolutely necessary to explain experimental observations .",
    "an emerging property of almost all the so - far studied scale - free networks is that they can at the same time be classified as small - world networks @xcite .",
    "that is , ( i ) the diameter of the network scales as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the total number of nodes in the system , and ( ii ) the clustering coefficient @xmath14 is independent of @xmath13 and is thus much greater than that of a random network ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the average node - degree of the network ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "it was confirmed that growing networks generated by the mechanism of preferential attachment will typically have diameters scales as @xmath12 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "however , the original barabsi - albert model @xcite predicted a very small clustering coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "the clustering coefficients for other models @xcite were not reported .    to improve our understanding on scale - free networks , in this work",
    "two questions are addressed : will it be possible to generate a scale - free network with scaling exponent @xmath18 based on the preferential attachment mechanism ? will it be possible for a scale - free network generated this way to have relatively constant clustering coefficients ?",
    "we answer these questions confirmatively by studying a revised krapivsky - rodgers - redner model @xcite with monte carlo simulation approach .",
    "the krapivsky - rodgers - redner model @xcite is a generalized version of the original barabsi - albert model on scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "it has the following key elements : ( i ) edges are directed ; ( ii ) new nodes are added into the network and are attached preferentially to existing nodes with larger in - degrees ; ( iii ) creation of edges between @xmath10old  nodes are possible and a newly created edge also prefer to attach to nodes with larger degrees .",
    "this model is general in the sense that it takes into account directional interactions of the real network systems , and that the growth of the network is not solely caused by the inclusion of new nodes but also as a result of the increased interactions among the existing nodes of the system .",
    "it can be corresponded to the real systems including the world - wide web ( www ) , the internet , the food web , the transportation network , the e - mail network , etc .. because of its generality , we re - examine this model in the present work to illustrate the property of growing scale - free network .",
    "we noticed in the original krapivsky - rodgers - redner model @xcite the growth process permits the following two possibilities illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig01 ] : ( 1 ) a directed edge can originate from and end into the same node ( self - connection ) and ( 2 ) there can be more than one edges of the same direction between two nodes ( multiconnection ) .",
    "allowing these two possibilities makes analytical calculations possible and these authors found that in the growing network , both the in - degree and the out - degree distribution follow the power - law @xcite : @xmath19 @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the three adjustable model parameters ) . although the permission of self - connections and multiconnections might be reasonable for some networks ( such as www pages , in which a page can have several links to another page and it can have a link bring the reader from one portion to another portion of the same page ) , it may fail for other kinds of networks ( in a co - authorship network @xcite , it is meaningless for a author to be the co - author of himself / herself ; and in a food web @xcite , there is at most one edge of the same direction between two species ) . because of the preferential attachment mechanism , if a node already has a large number of incoming and outgoing edges , it has a good possibility to form self - connections and by doing so its dominance is further amplified ; allowing multiconnection has similar effects . as a result , edges may concentrate on just few nodes , making the scaling behavior steeper . in the present work , the two kind of edges listed in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig01 ] are discounted . because of the reasoning outlined above , scaling exponents @xmath24 might occur in a growing network without self - connection and multiconnection .",
    "this point will be checked by monte carlo simulation .",
    "the revised krapivsky - rodgers - redner model is studied by mc simulation",
    ". started with a single node , at each step :    ( i ) : :    with probability @xmath21 , a new node is created and a directed    edge from it to an existing target node @xmath25 is setup .",
    "of all the @xmath13 existing nodes , @xmath25 will be    selected with probability @xcite    @xmath26 in the above equation ,    @xmath27 , the in - degree , is the total number of    incoming edges of node @xmath25 ; @xmath22 is a    constant signifying the @xmath10initial attractiveness  of a    node @xcite ; and @xmath28 is the total number of edges in the    system before this new edge is created .",
    "( ii ) : :    with probability @xmath29 , a new edge pointing from one    node @xmath30 to another node @xmath25 is    created , provided that ( 1 ) @xmath31 , ( 2 )    @xmath30 and @xmath25 are not identical , and    ( 3 ) there is no any preexisting directed edge from    @xmath30 to @xmath25 .",
    "the probability that    @xmath30 and @xmath25 will be selected is    governed by the probability    @xmath32[k_{\\rm in}(\\beta)+\\lambda ] \\over     \\sum\\limits_{\\gamma}{\\sum\\limits_{\\delta}}^\\prime [ k_{\\rm out}(\\gamma)+\\mu ]    [ k_{\\rm in}(\\delta)+\\lambda ] } ,    \\label{eq : p_connect}\\ ] ] where @xmath33    denotes the out - degree of node @xmath30 ; @xmath23    is another constant with similar physical meaning as    @xmath22 ; @xmath34    denotes the summation over all the nodes @xmath35 which is    not yet approached by a directed edge from node @xmath36 .    for large system size",
    "@xmath13 it turns out to be quite inefficient and complicated when performing procedure ( ii ) based on a direct application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_connect ] ) .",
    "this is partly because of the fact that , after a new edge has been created between node @xmath30 and @xmath25 , one must update the value of the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_connect ] ) by @xmath37 iterations . to speed up procedure ( ii ) , the selection of two nodes and the connection of an edge between them is finished actually through the following way :    ( 1 ) : :    select a outgoing node @xmath30 with probability    @xmath38/(e+\\mu n)$ ] ; ( 2 ) : :    select an in - coming node @xmath25 with probability    @xmath39/(e+\\lambda n)$ ] ; ( 3 ) : :    if @xmath30 and @xmath25 are identical , or if    there is already a directed edge from @xmath30 to    @xmath25 , repeat steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ; if else , accept    @xmath30 and @xmath25 and update the system .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that by this method the probability for nodes @xmath30 and @xmath25 be chosen is identical to eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_connect ] ) .",
    "the algorithm code is written in c++ language @xcite , with some of its standard containers ( including _ map _ and _ set _ ) being exploited .    to estimate the scaling exponents from the simulated data , we use two methods",
    "one can directly fit the data with eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] .",
    "alternatively , one can define the cumulative degree distribution by @xmath40 and from the cumulative distribution data an estimation of the value of @xmath7 could be obtained .",
    "in the growing network model , there are three adjustable parameters , namely @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig02 ] shows the relations between the average number of nodes and the in - degree and out - degree for both the original and the revised krapivsky - rodgers - redner model .",
    "figure [ fig : fig03 ] shows the corresponding cumulative degree distributions for the two models .",
    "the network is the result of @xmath41 growing steps .    at @xmath42 ( a new node",
    "will be included on average every @xmath43 steps ) , @xmath44 and @xmath45 the original model @xcite predicts @xmath46 and @xmath47 . from the mc data we obtain that @xmath48 and @xmath49 , in close agreement with the analytical values .",
    "at these same parameters , the revised model has @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "thus , excluding of self - connection and multiconnection leads to decreased values for the scaling exponents .",
    "other quantitative differences are :    ( 1 ) : :    in the revised model there is a cut - off in the in - degree distribution :    no node has in - degree @xmath52 . while in the    original model , there are nodes with in - degree as large as    @xmath53 .",
    "( 2 ) : :    in the revised model the out - degree distribution has an exponential    cut - off around @xmath54 ; while in the original model , there    are nodes with out - degree as large as @xmath55 .",
    "( 3 ) : :    the value of @xmath4 is much larger in the revised model    than in the original model for a given @xmath5 ( less than the    cut - off value ) .",
    "this holds both for the in - degree distribution and for    the out - degree distribution .",
    "these observations lead to the following picture : by prohibiting self - connection and multiconnection , edges which originally belong to just few @xmath10suppernodes  are now redistributed to those nodes of small or intermediate in- and out - degrees .",
    "consequently , the number of nodes with small and intermediate node - degrees increases considerably , resulting in a smaller scaling exponent in the power - law decrease of the distribution and a cut - off in the tail of this distribution .    in fig .  [ fig : fig04 ] we demonstrate the simulation result when the probability of node addition is changed to @xmath56 ( a new node will be included on average every @xmath57 steps ) while the other two parameters are kept the same values as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig02 ] . in these parameters , the original model predicts @xmath58 ( theory ) and @xmath59 ( mc ) and @xmath60 ( theory ) and @xmath61 ( mc ) ; while the revised model has an in - degree exponent @xmath62 and an out - degree exponent @xmath63 , both of which are markedly smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the exclusion of self - connection and multi - connection can change the scaling exponent of the scale - free network dramatically when each node has a relatively large average node - degrees .",
    "it can be anticipated that similar behavior will be observed when the initial attractiveness parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , of each node are varied .",
    "it is therefore possible for the present model to explain networks with scaling exponent @xmath18 .",
    "however , could the observation of scaling exponents @xmath24 be an artifact caused by finite - size effects ?",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig05 ] the calculated in - degree scaling exponent is plotted as a function of the total growth steps .",
    "this figure strongly indicates that even for an infinite system the scaling exponents will still be less than @xmath1 .",
    "adamic and huberman @xcite studied the www by mapping each web domain ( rather than each web - page ) as a single node , and they reported an in - degree scaling exponent of @xmath64 .",
    "mossa and co - authors , upon their reinterpretation of the www data of barabsi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , reported an exponent of @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the e - mail network studied in ref .",
    "@xcite has a scaling exponent in the range @xmath66 . and",
    "even smaller scaling exponents are reported in several other networks @xcite . to attain quantitative agreement to these empirical data , one need nevertheless more information to help fixing the values of the adjustable parameters .",
    "a persistent property of the revised network model is that there is a rapid decay in the out - degree distribution ( which occurs at @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig04]b ) .",
    "such a rapid decay was not observed in the original model .",
    "this feature is also absent in the in - degree distribution of both the revised and the original model , although the in - degree distribution of the revised model does have a cut - off for large @xmath5 .",
    "experimentally , it was reported that both the www network @xcite and the e - mail network @xcite show exponential cut - off in the node - degree distribution .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , many real scale - free network at the same time show small - world behavior @xcite : having small diameters and being highly clustered . for the original krapivsky - rodgers - redner model , it has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that the average minimum path scales as @xmath12 .",
    "we anticipate this to be hold also for the revised model . here",
    "we focus on the clustering characteristics of the revised model system , with the parameters setting equal to those of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig02 ] , i.e. , @xmath42 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and a total @xmath68 growing steps .",
    "denote @xmath70 as the _ complete _ set of nodes which are the @xmath10downstream  neighbors of node @xmath30 , namely there exists a directed edge from @xmath30 to each nodes in @xmath70 ; similarly we define @xmath71 as the complete set of nodes which are the @xmath10upstream  neighbors of node @xmath30 .",

    ", such a large value of @xmath2 is surprising .",
    "it suggests the average interaction between the nodes which are in the downstream group of a given node is considerably strong . how to understand this kind of asymmetry , namely @xmath90 ?",
    "we suggest the following possibility : in the network , there are some nodes which are so popular that a large population of the whole nodes will have an edge pointing to them ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig02]a ) .",
    "consequently , these nodes will have great possibility to belong to the downstream group of any particular node , and they will also have great possibility to be pointed to by other members of this group , making @xmath2 to be proportional to unity .",
    "however , the number of nodes decays quickly when the out - degree increases to about @xmath91 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig02]b ) .",
    "therefore , in the network there is no node which are so `` generous '' that it points to a large population of the whole network .",
    "this may make the value of @xmath78 small .",
    "in other words , it might be the existence of an steep cut - off in the out - degree profile that accounts for the difference in the clustering coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath78 .",
    "for a particular node @xmath30 , suppose node @xmath93 .",
    "then @xmath94 is the total number of nodes that are pointed to by both @xmath30 and @xmath25 .",
    "we define @xmath95 the triangle coefficient @xmath92 signifies to what extent , if there is a directed edge from node @xmath30 to node @xmath25 and there is a directed edge from @xmath25 to node @xmath36 , there will also be a directed node from @xmath30 to @xmath36 .",
    "calculation revealed that @xmath96 .",
    "in this work we have used a revised krapivsky - rodgers - redner model to investigate the degree distribution of growing random network and to investigate whether such a kind of growing network could be regarded as a small - world network . after excluding the possibility of self - connection ( fig .  [ fig : fig01]a ) and requiring that there is at most one directed edge from one node to any another node ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig01]b ) , the monte carlo simulation demonstrated that scale - free network with degree distribution coefficient @xmath7 less than @xmath1 can be generated . and",
    "it is also revealed that the average interactions between the nodes which are belong to the downstream group of a particular node is very strong , suggesting the growing network at the same time forms a @xmath10small world  . the strong interaction in the downstream group of a particular node",
    "was suggested to be closely related to the existence of several @xmath10popular  nodes which are pointed to by a large fraction of the total population in the node system .",
    "previous efforts often predicted that the scaling exponent @xmath7 should be larger than @xmath1 , and there is still not many efforts to understand why many scale - free networks are at the same time small - world networks .",
    "it is hoped that the present work will help to improve our understanding of the occur of scale - free networks with @xmath18 and to improve our understanding of the close relationship between scale - free and small - world networks .",
    "the present work suggests that , by excluding the possibility of self - connection and multiconnection , those many edges , which were associated with several nodes of extremely large in- or out - degrees in the original krapivsky - rodgers - redner network , are now redistributed to nodes of small or intermediate degrees .",
    "this may explain why a dramatic decrease in scaling exponents could be observed .",
    "this work was financially supported by the alexander von humboldt foundation .",
    "the author is grateful for the hospitality of professor reinhard lipowsky .",
    "if the node degree distribution looks like a power law with the exponent smaller than @xmath1 , its tail must have a different exponent or have some sort of cut - off , since the average number of edges connected to one node should be finite .",
    "a cut - off in the distribution is observed in the present work ."
