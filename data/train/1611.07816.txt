    "the design of reliable and efficient a posteriori error indicators for guiding local refinement when solving numerically partial differential equations is essential , both for defining a robust and automatic adaptive procedure and for ensuring to find suitable approximations of the desired solution without exceeding the limits of available softwares .",
    "the main idea behind a posteriori error estimation is to build a properly locally refined mesh in order to equidistribute the approximation error .",
    "whereas for standard finite element methods several intuitive ways of refining locally a mesh are clear and broadly analysed , for isogeometric methods  @xcite , the development of efficient and robust strategies to get suitably locally refined meshes constitutes a challenging problem because the tensor product structure of b - splines  @xcite is broken .",
    "different alternatives have been proposed in order to tackle this situation , such as hierarchical splines , t - splines , lr - splines or pht - splines . among them , hierarchical splines based on the construction presented in  @xcite ( see also the previous work  @xcite ) are probably the easiest to define and to implement for their use in the context of isogeometric methods .    regarding a posteriori error estimation using hierachical spline spaces for discretizations in isogeometric methods , up to this moment we can only mention the results from  @xcite , where residual based error indicators has been proposed . in that case , the authors considered an approach following the standard techniques in classical finite elements for deriving element - based a posteriori error estimators using the truncated basis for hierachical splines introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the presented proof for the reliability of such estimators needs to assume some restrictions over the hierachical meshes , with the purpose of controlling the overlap of the truncated basis function supports .    we notice that although truncation is indeed a possible strategy to recover partition of unity , this procedure requires a specific construction that entails complicated basis function supports",
    ", that may be non convex and/or not connected , and their use may produce a non negligible overhead with an adaptive strategy .",
    "thus , in this article , we consider the hierachical basis without truncation recovering the simplicity of basis function supports , that in this case are boxes .",
    "moreover , taking into account the hierachical space defined in  @xcite , we can also recover the partition of unity .",
    "the main goal of this article is to obtain simple residual type a posteriori error estimators for linear second order elliptic problems using discretizations in hierarchical spline spaces .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , where the hierarchical basis can be obtained simply through parent - children relations , the design of estimators associated to basis functions ( instead of elements ) seems to be more suitable or natural for guiding adaptive refinements .",
    "we derive reliable function - based a posteriori error indicators without any restrictions over the hierachical mesh configurations , i.e. , we are able to bound the error in energy norm by our global a posteriori error indicator . in order to prove such upper bound for the error , it is key the use of some poincar type inequalities where the b - splines are weight functions and also that their supports are , obviously , convex sets . in this point",
    "it is important to remark that a posteriori error estimations in the context of classical finite element methods have been widely studied in the available literature , see for example ,  @xcite and  @xcite . on a hand ,",
    "our approach can be considered as a generalization to high order splines of some existent poincar type inequalities ; and on the other hand , in order to do that , we follow closely the lines from  @xcite , where specific poincar type inequalities are proved and the classical barycentric coordinate functions appear as weight functions .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : setting ] we briefly introduce the variational formulation of the elliptic problem that we consider , and in section  [ s : discretization ] we describe precisely the hierachical spline spaces that we use for its galerkin discretization .",
    "next , we state and prove some poincar type inequalities that have b - splines as weight functions in section  [ s : poincare ] , which are used in section  [ s : estimators ] to derive function - based a posteriori error estimators and to prove that such estimators constitute an upper bound for the energy error . in section  [ s : refinement ]",
    "we analyse a reduction property of our estimators after refinement of the hierachical mesh . finally , in section  [ s : aigm ] we propose an adaptive algorithm guided by our estimators and illustrate its behaviour through several numerical tests , showing that the global estimator is efficient and the algorithm experimentally converges with the optimal rate .",
