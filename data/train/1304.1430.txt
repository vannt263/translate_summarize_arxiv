    "object ( 3200 ) phaethon ( formerly 1983 tb ) is dynamically associated with the geminid meteor stream , suggesting that it is the long - sought parent of this stream @xcite . unlike the cometary parents of most streams , however , phaethon has a distinctly asteroidal orbit ( semimajor axis = 1.271 au , eccentricity = 0.890 , inclination = 22.2 ) , with an asteroid - like tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter of @xmath9 = 4.5 .",
    "phaethon is about 5 km in diameter ( v - band geometric albedo = 0.17 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and appears to be dynamically associated not just with the geminids , but also with at least two smaller ( kilometer - scale ) asteroids , namely 2005 ud and 1999 yc . together , these objects constitute the so - called `` phaethon - geminid complex '' ( pgc ) presumably formed by the disruption of a larger parent body .",
    "physical observations show that the pgc members share similar neutral - blue colors that are relatively rare in the main - belt population and suggesting a common composition .",
    "the pgc objects all possess small perihelion distances ( 0.14 au in the case of phaethon ) resulting in high surface temperatures .",
    "physical observations of phaethon when far from perihelion have consistently failed to show evidence for on - going mass loss , either in gas or in scattered continuum from entrained dust @xcite .",
    "neither do the associated bodies 2005 ud and 1999 yc ( references above ) show evidence for on - going mass loss .",
    "however , observations of phaethon at very small solar elongations using the stereo spacecraft revealed anomalous photometric behavior near perihelion in 2009 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , paper i ) .",
    "specifically , phaethon was observed to brighten with increasing phase angle ( near @xmath080 ) when near perihelion , a behavior inconsistent with scattering from any macroscopic solid body and opposite to the phase functions of known solar system objects @xcite .",
    "we interpreted the brightening as caused by an increase in the scattering cross - section following the ejection of dust from phaethon .",
    "the required mass of dust is @xmath02.5@xmath310@xmath10 kg , where @xmath5 is the unmeasured size of the dust grains , expressed in millimeters ( paper i ) .",
    "these observations are potentially important both for showing that phaethon is an active source of matter for the geminid stream , and for illuminating physical processes induced on bodies when close to the sun .    in this paper , we report new stereo observations of phaethon in 2010 and 2012 combined with a re - analysis of measurements from 2009 earlier reported in paper i. the principal question we seek to address is whether the anomalous brightening detected in 2009 is recurrent at subsequent perihelia .",
    "the present observations were made with the heliospheric imagers ( hi ) which are part of the sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ( secchi ) package @xcite onboard the stereo spacecraft .",
    "the hi instruments consist of two wide - angle visible - light imagers , hi-1 and hi-2 , with field centers offset from the solar center by 14.0@xmath11 and 53.7@xmath11 , and fields of view @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . the hi detectors are charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) with 2048@xmath32048 pixels . these are usually binned onboard to 1024@xmath31024 pixels , resulting in a binned pixel angular size of 70  for hi-1 and 4  for hi-2 .",
    "the very large pixels subtend solid angles 10@xmath14 to 10@xmath15 times those of pixels commonly used on night - time telescopes , but this is an advantage for the intended detection of large scale , diffuse structures in the solar corona .",
    "we used the standard hi-1 camera level 1 images in our study .",
    "the data are publicly available via the uk solar system data center ( ukssdc ) web site .",
    "multiple short - exposure images are taken before a 1024@xmath31024 pixel - image is transmitted to earth .",
    "the individual exposure time is 40 seconds , the exposure cadence is 60 seconds and 30 images are combined to make a single image having an exposure time of 20 minutes .",
    "one such image is obtained every 40 minutes .",
    "this strategy is designed to remove cosmic rays , achieve statistical accuracy and avoid saturation of the background corona .",
    "the exposure sequence is chosen so that the drift of the star field through the field of view ( at @xmath16  hr@xmath17 ) is comparable to the binned pixel size . the quantum efficiency of the ccd camera and the absolute transmission efficiencies of the optics are nearly constant across the 6300 to 7300   wavelength range ( eyles et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the short orbit period ( 1.43 yr ) offers frequent opportunities to observe phaethon at perihelion .",
    "the orbit period of stereo a is @xmath0346 days so that three stereo orbits ( 2.84 yr ) are almost exactly equal to twice the orbit period of phaethon ( 2.86 yr ) .",
    "therefore , observations in 2009 ( perihelion june 20 ) and 2012 ( perihelion may 02 ) share similar perspectives viewed from stereo a.    we obtained the celestial coordinates of phaethon from nasa s horizons web - interface and transformed them to pixel coordinates on the hi cameras in the `` azp '' zenithal projection .",
    "the sky - plane trajectories of phaethon are shown in fig .",
    "( [ path ] ) .",
    "as expected , they follow similar paths in 2009 and 2012 .",
    "the angular speed of phaethon in the images is the result of the combined spacecraft parallactic motion and object keplerian motion .",
    "viewed from stereo a , phaethon moved relative to the field center at a speed varying between 0  hr@xmath17 and 175  hr@xmath17 from east to west , and at a roughly constant speed 180  hr@xmath17 ( in 2009 ) and 200  hr@xmath17 ( in 2012 ) from south to north .",
    "phaethon was readily apparent even in a cursory visual examination of the 2009 and 2012 data .",
    "the observing geometry in the intervening orbit in 2010 is completely different from that in 2009 and 2012 .",
    "phaethon was in the field of view of stereo a from november 11 - 19 and from december 15 - 25 ( upper panel in figure [ path2010 ] ) .",
    "it left the hi-1 field of view six days before its perihelion on november 25 and only re - entered the field about twenty days after perihelion in the second time period .",
    "phaethon was not detected in either observing window . during the first time interval , the phase angle was above @xmath18 making an unfavorable condition for detection . during the second time interval ,",
    "the phase angle was a modest 10@xmath11 , but the heliocentric distance had increased to @xmath00.8 au . as a result ,",
    "the nominal predicted magnitude had fallen to v @xmath015 , making phaethon too faint to be detected in stereo data .",
    "phaethon stayed within the field of the stereo b hi-1 camera for almost three months during its 2010 return ( bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ path2010 ] ) but still contrived to leave the field of view six days before perihelion . between mid - august and mid - november , the phase angle varied from @xmath19 to a maximum @xmath20 , while the heliocentric distance decreased from 1.8 to 0.3 au .",
    "the apparent visual magnitude calculated assuming solid body reflection decreased from 18.5 to 12.5 . at its predicted brightest , phaethon should have been marginally within reach of stereo hi-1 camera detection , but in practice the object was not detected .    presumably as a result of these different observational circumstances , the anomalous brightening detected in 2009 and 2012 was not found in 2010 .",
    "activity specifically at perihelion could not be detected because phaethon was outside the fields of both the a and b cameras when at perihelion .",
    "we conclude that differences in the observational geometry prohibited the detection of phaethon and its activity at perihelion in 2010 .      to supplement the near - sun photometry from stereo , we also observed phaethon when far from the sun using the keck 10-m telescope on ut 2012 october 14.5 .",
    "we used the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris , see oke et al .",
    "1995 ) and a broadband r filter ( central wavelength @xmath21 = 6417 , full - width at half maximum , fwhm = 1185 ) in seeing of fwhm = 1.0 .",
    "the lris pixel scale is 0.135pixel@xmath17 .",
    "flat field images were obtained using an illuminated patch on the inside of the keck dome .",
    "the data were photometrically calibrated using solar - colored standard stars from @xcite .",
    "we measured @xmath22 = 17.25@xmath230.05 at heliocentric and geocentric distances 2.184 au and 1.346 au , respectively , and phase angle @xmath24 = 18.1 .",
    "this measurement refers to an unknown rotational phase of phaethon .",
    "with pixel sizes 70 , images of hi-1 are sensitive to the diffuse background coronal emission but under - sample the point - spread function of the telescope , and lead to frequent confusion with background sources as phaethon moves across the sky . in these data ,",
    "the relatively uniformly distributed background corona overwhelms both field stars and phaethon . to suppress the coronal background , we grouped images over timespans from a few hours to a few days . within each group ,",
    "the background corona was relatively constant , and was calculated using the minimum filter technique ( an idl code `` min_filter '' in the solarsoft idl package was used ) and then subtracted from the images in the group .",
    "the coronal filtering leaves rapidly varying background structures visible in the images , but they are muted in intensity compared to those present in the raw data .",
    "sample corona - subtracted images are shown in figures ( [ path ] ) and ( [ path2010 ] ) .    during the 30 minutes required to accumulate a single hi-1 image",
    ", phaethon moved a maximum of 1.8 pixels ( 126 ) relative to the ccd .",
    "we experimented with different photometry apertures in order to examine the effects of trailing and background subtraction .",
    "in particular , we checked that the measured brightness variations are not related to the angular speed of phaethon and therefore to trailing of the images .",
    "very small apertures are sensitive to the trailing , while very large ones achieve poor signal - to - noise ratios owing to uncertainty in the large background signal from the corona . by trial and error",
    ", we chose a photometry box of 5@xmath35 pixels ( 350@xmath3350 ) .",
    "the sky background was obtained from the median count in 56 sky pixels defined by a box 9@xmath39 pixels ( 630@xmath3630 ) wide , surrounding the 5@xmath35 object extraction box .",
    "results obtained using larger photometry apertures were consistent with those eventually used , but with a larger uncertainty due to noise in the coronal background . to facilitate comparison with measurements from paper i and to make sure that no systematic effects were introduced during our analysis",
    ", we elected to completely re - reduce the 2009 data - set , as well as those obtained near perihelion in 2010 and 2012 .",
    "the extracted , raw phaethon photometry from 2009 and 2012 is shown in figure ( [ photo ] ) .",
    "the photometry statistics are given in table ( [ stats ] ) .",
    "to be conservative , we set a photometry threshold at three times the mean of the sky , as shown by the horizontal lines in figure ( [ photo ] ) .",
    "the thresholds lead to windows in which the photometry is useful lasting for 5.5 days ( from june 17.5 to 23 ) in 2009 and 3.8 days ( from april 30.5 to may 4.3 ) in 2012 .",
    "the corresponding phase angles range from @xmath25 to @xmath26 in 2009 , and from @xmath27 to @xmath28 in 2012 . in both years",
    ", phaethon shows an apparent brightness surge by a factor of @xmath03 relative to the pre - surge brightness and lasting for approximately two days .",
    "each surge is characterized by a sudden rise and fall , with no `` plateau '' phase in between .",
    "phaethon s brightness surges are too large and too long - lived ( the photometry aperture crossing time is measured in hours while the brightennings last for days ) to be caused by passing stars . contaminating stars of sufficient brightness would , in any case , be apparent in visual examination of the images but were not seen .",
    "in fact , we discarded images in which bright stars interfered with the object .",
    "furthermore , the background is constant with respect to time except for small excursions of @xmath2310% due to passing stars ( blue circles in figure [ photo ] ) . for these reasons",
    ", we are confident that the brightening in 2009 and 2012 is real and associated with phaethon , not caused by background object contamination or sky subtraction errors .    to photometrically calibrate the measurements of figure ( [ photo ] ) , we chose field stars near the projected path of phaethon across the ccd .",
    "field stars were chosen to be within 20 pixels ( @xmath29 ) of phaethon , with magnitudes @xmath30 10 and of spectral types fgk .",
    "eleven standard stars in 2009 , and fifteen stars in 2012 were available for the phaethon flux calibration ( see table [ stars ] ) .",
    "reference star photometry was obtained in the same manner as for phaethon .",
    "the 6300   to 7300   passband of the stereo camera is close to astronomical r - band .",
    "however , phaethon is nearly neutral and the reference stars were selected to be similar in color to the sun .",
    "our measurements of the brightness ratio are equivalent to v - band measurements save for a small , color - correction offset @xmath310.1 mag . , which is negligible compared to the uncertainties of measurement .",
    "figure ( [ magv ] ) shows the resulting apparent magnitudes of phaethon as a function of time in the time windows of the phaethon visibility .",
    "the times of perihelion ut 2009 june 20 07:12 and ut 2012 may 2 07:12 are indicated by arrows and marked with the letter `` p '' . shown for comparison",
    "are the magnitudes predicted by the jpl horizons program , based on an extrapolation of photometry obtained at small phase angles .",
    "the approximate apparent visual magnitude is calculated for solid body reflection at the given heliocentric and phaethon - stereo distances .",
    "the first observations in each year are brighter than the prediction by about 0.5 magnitude .",
    "this difference is physically insignificant , since the horizons brightness prediction is based on an assumed ( not measured ) phase function extrapolated to large angles .",
    "however , the brightening with time ( and phase angle ) shortly after perihelion in each year is highly significant .",
    "monolithic , macroscopic bodies fade dramatically as a result of phase darkening in this range , opposite to the observed brightening .",
    "to correct for the variations in the heliocentric and phaethon - stereo distances , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively ( both expressed in au ) , we use the inverse - square law , written    @xmath34    here @xmath35 is the apparent magnitude and @xmath36 is the resulting magnitude which would be observed from @xmath32 = @xmath33 = 1 and phase angle @xmath24 . equation ( [ m11a ] ) is plotted against @xmath24 in figure ( [ mag - phase ] ) .",
    "since the individual measurements are very scattered ( figure [ magv ] ) , the plotted curves show the running means of 10% of the data .",
    "also plotted in the figure is @xmath37 from our keck observation on ut 2012 october 14 , and @xmath38 from @xcite .",
    "the latter two measurements are plotted with error bars of @xmath230.2 mag .  to represent uncertainty resulting from their being taken at unknown rotational phase .",
    "the combined ground - based and space - based data show a trend towards fading @xmath36 upto @xmath39 60 .",
    "specifically , phaethon fades by @xmath01 mag . from @xmath24 = 18.1  to @xmath24 = 60 , giving a linear phase coefficient , @xmath00.024 mag .",
    "degree@xmath17 , that is unremarkable when compared with other asteroids . at larger",
    "@xmath24 , phaethon in figure ( [ mag - phase ] ) shows sudden distance - corrected brightening starting at @xmath40 in 2009 and @xmath41 in 2012 .",
    "these phase angles correspond to perihelion in each year , while maximum brightness is reached at @xmath42 in 2009 and @xmath43 in 2012 , about 0.5 day later .",
    "phaethon fades to invisibility at larger phase angles .",
    "as noted in paper i , this brightness variation is unexpected for a solid body viewed in scattered light .",
    "for such an object , the brightness decreases monotonically as the phase angle increases both because a progressively smaller fraction of the surface is illuminated and because the scattering efficiency of the surface decreases as the scattering angle grows .",
    "this is emphasized in figure ( [ mag - phase ] ) , which compares phaethon with the scaled phase function of the moon , taken from @xcite .",
    "the plotted lunar curve is an average of the phase functions at wavelengths 6264   and 7297   in table v of their paper .",
    "we show the difference between @xmath36 and the scaled magnitude of the moon in figure ( [ mag - phase_moon ] ) .",
    "the difference plot shows that phaethon s phase dependence is moon - like before the onset of the anomalous brightening event in each year .",
    "while the apparent brightness of phaethon ( figure [ magv ] ) increased by slightly more than a magnitude near @xmath24 = 80  to 100 , the brightening relative to the phase - darkened nucleus ( figure [ mag - phase ] ) is a much larger @xmath02 magnitudes , corresponding to a factor @xmath06 .",
    "the figure also shows that the apparent , post - peak fading in figure ( [ magv ] ) is consistent with the dimming expected from the phase function , not necessarily to loss of the scattering cross - section .",
    "we first consider and reject several mechanisms that might be implicated in the observed anomalous brightening at perihelion .",
    "the intrinsic brightening is too large ( 2 mag . )  and too long - lived ( 2 days ) to be plausibly attributed to rotational variation of the projected cross - section of the aspherical nucleus of phaethon .",
    "lightcurve observations show a variation @xmath440.4 magnitudes and a rotational period of only @xmath03.6 hrs @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the brightening might be caused by a glint ( a specular reflection from a mirror - like patch on the surface ) can likewise be rejected on the basis of the longevity of the event .",
    "( separately , the likelihood that the surface of a rocky asteroid could be mirror - like in the optical seems remote ) .",
    "as noted in paper i , the brightening of phaethon can not be attributed to comet - like processes driven by the sublimation of near - surface water ice .",
    "this is because surface temperatures on phaethon are far too high for water ice to survive .",
    "the deep interior temperature ( identified with the blackbody temperature of a body moving with phaethon s orbitally - averaged heliocentric distance ) is also too high to permit the survival of buried ice ( paper i ) .",
    "even if it were present , deeply - buried ice would be thermally decoupled from the instantaneous solar insolation ( the conduction timescale across the radius is @xmath4510@xmath14 yr ) , leaving no explanation for why the brightening is correlated with perihelion .",
    "the solar wind kinetic energy flux onto the surface of phaethon is @xmath46 ( w m@xmath47 ) , where @xmath48 is the solar wind mass density , and @xmath49 is the solar wind speed . at the earth s orbit ,",
    "the solar wind number density is about 10@xmath50 m@xmath51 .",
    "scaled by the inverse - square law to perihelion at 0.14 au , the density is about @xmath52=5@xmath310@xmath53 m@xmath51 .",
    "the solar wind speed varies with time and radius , but is of order @xmath54 km / s . substituting @xmath55 , where @xmath56 ( for protons ) , and @xmath57 kg , we obtain @xmath58 0.05 w m@xmath47",
    "this is tiny compared with the solar radiation flux at perihelion , @xmath59 w m@xmath47 .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the solar wind is a negligible source of energy and can not account for the anomalous brightening by impact fluorescence",
    ".    could part or all of the measured excess optical brightness be thermal emission resulting from phaethon s high surface temperatures when at perihelion ?",
    "we obtain a rough lower limit to the temperature by considering the case of an isothermal , spherical blackbody in equilibrium with sunlight , namely @xmath60 . at perihelion ,",
    "@xmath32 = 0.14 , we find @xmath61 = 743 k. a practical upper limit is given by the sub - solar temperature on a non - rotating body ( or a rotating one whose rotation axis points at the sun ) , namely @xmath62 , giving @xmath63 = 1050 k for phaethon at perihelion .",
    "this temperature range is in good agreement with independent estimates ( @xmath0800 @xmath64 1100 k ) from @xcite .",
    "a detailed calculation of the thermal emission from the surface of phaethon depends on many unknowns and is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "instead , we set a strong upper limit to the possible thermally emitted flux density by assuming that the whole surface of phaethon ( not just the sub - solar region ) is at @xmath63 , the maximum possible surface equilibrium temperature . under this assumption , the flux density in the stereo bandpass is calculated from @xmath65 \\label{heat}\\ ] ]    in which @xmath66 is the planck function evaluated at @xmath67 , @xmath68 = 2.5 km is the effective circular radius of phaethon , @xmath69 is the phaethon - to - observer distance , the integration is taken over the filter transmission from @xmath70 = 6300   to @xmath71 = 7300  , and @xmath72 .",
    "for comparison with equation ( [ heat ] ) , we convert the apparent magnitudes , @xmath35 , into flux densities , @xmath73 , using @xmath74 [ erg s@xmath17 cm@xmath47 @xmath17 ] ( drilling and landolt 2000 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure ( [ flux ] ) , where solutions to equation ( [ heat ] ) ( blue ) are compared with the observations ( red ) .",
    "evidently , thermal emission even at the peak sub - solar temperature is orders of magnitude too small to account for the anomalous brightening of phaethon observed in our data .    to see this a different way , we substituted the measured peak flux densities , @xmath77 10@xmath78 erg s@xmath17 cm@xmath47 @xmath17 ( c.f .",
    "figure [ flux ] ) , into the left - hand side of equation ( [ heat ] ) and solved for the temperature .",
    "we find that values @xmath79 1650 k ( 2009 ) and 1700 k ( 2012 ) would be needed for thermal emission to account for the anomalous optical brightening .",
    "this is far hotter even than the sub - solar temperature on the nucleus at perihelion and , therefore , can be discounted as unphysical .",
    "we conclude that the perihelion brightening of phaethon is not due to thermal emission from the surface .",
    "the passband of the stereo camera includes the 6300  and 6363  forbidden lines of oxygen .",
    "these are `` prompt emissions '' , formed when oxygen atoms are produced in the excited @xmath80d state by photodissociation of a parent molecule , for example water ( festou and feldman 1981 ) . as noted earlier , although water ice can not survive , water might be bound within hydrated minerals in phaethon and released by desiccation . in the case of water ,",
    "the photodissociation timescale at perihelion is about half an hour , so that any water molecules released from phaethon would be destroyed within a single pixel of the stereo camera .",
    "we estimate the flux density produced by prompt emission in oxygen , averaged over the passband of the camera , from    @xmath81 } = \\frac{\\alpha q h c } { 4\\pi \\delta^2 \\lambda \\delta \\lambda } \\ ] ]    in which @xmath39 10% is the fraction of water dissociations leaving oxygen in the excited @xmath80d state , @xmath82 is the production rate of water molecules , @xmath83 is planck s constant , @xmath84 is the speed of light , @xmath69 is the phaethon to stereo distance , @xmath85 is the wavelength and @xmath86 is the filter fwhm , expressed in angstroms . setting @xmath87}$ ]",
    "= @xmath88 , we find that a water production rate @xmath89 10@xmath90 s@xmath17 ( 3@xmath310@xmath91 kg s@xmath17 ) would be needed to account for the measured excess flux density of phaethon .",
    "although the required rate of production ( which is similar to that of comet 1p / halley at perihelion ) seems high , we can not rigorously rule out the possibility that some fraction of the excess perihelion emission is caused by prompt emission from oxygen .",
    "however , the observation that the fading of phaethon after peak brightness follows the phase function of a solid object ( figure [ mag - phase ] ) suggests that gas is not the dominant cause of the anomalous brightness .",
    "the remaining alternative is that phaethon has ejected dust particles with a combined cross - section larger than that of the solid nucleus , as earlier concluded in paper i. in this scenario , the rise in brightness in figure ( [ photo ] ) then corresponds to the ejection of dust , while the subsequent decline in brightness is naturally explained as fading owing to the ever - growing phase dimming , perhaps aided by grain sublimation or disintegration . the natural test of this hypothesis would be to search for coma scattered by the ejected dust .",
    "unfortunately , as also noted in paper i , the limited angular resolution and high background surface brightness in the stereo data make the detection of resolved coma impossible .",
    "a temperature - controlled mechanism for the ejection of dust is strongly suggested ; the activity is observed at the highest ( perihelion ) temperatures , and is absent in observations of phaethon taken at substantially larger heliocentric distances and lower temperatures .",
    "the reflection spectrum of phaethon has been interpreted in terms of thermally modified hydrated minerals while the depletion of sodium in some geminids provides independent evidence for thermal alteration .",
    "the perihelion temperatures on phaethon exceed those needed to break - down phyllosilicates @xcite , and are sufficient to induce thermal fracture ( paper i , * ? ? ?",
    "in this sense , thermal disintegration and fracture are plausible sources of the anomalous brightening and phaethon may be accurately labeled a `` rock comet '' ( paper i ) .",
    "an additional requirement is that dust must be cleared from the surface in order for these processes to operate .",
    "a regolith of fine particles built up in previous orbits will inhibit thermal fracture , since small grains are unable to sustain large temperature differences .",
    "likewise , surface materials dehydrated by baking in previous perihelion passages must be cleared away from the surface in order for dehydration cracking to remain a persistent dust source .    in both 2009 and 2012 , the apparent brightness increased by @xmath02 magnitudes relative to the nominal phase curve ( figures [ mag - phase ] and [ mag - phase_moon ] ) , corresponding to a factor of @xmath06 . given that the cross - section of the nucleus of phaethon is @xmath92 = @xmath9320 km@xmath94 , the cross - section of added dust is then @xmath95 = 100 km@xmath94 , in both years .",
    "the mass in spherical particles of mean radius @xmath96 having cross - section , @xmath95 , is    @xmath97    where @xmath48 is the grain density .",
    "with @xmath48 = 3000 kg m@xmath51 , we find @xmath98 4@xmath310@xmath53 @xmath5 kg , where @xmath5 is the grain radius expressed in millimeters .",
    "the mass of the nucleus , represented as a 2.5 km radius sphere of the same density , is a much larger 2@xmath310@xmath6 kg .",
    "the geminid stream mass is 10@xmath99 10@xmath8 kg , while the geminid stream lifetime estimated on dynamical grounds is @xmath1001000 year .",
    "accordingly , to explain the entire mass in the geminid stream through events like those observed here would require a number of similar events per orbit , @xmath101 , given by    @xmath102    where @xmath103 = 1.4 year is the orbital period .",
    "substituting , we obtain @xmath104 4@xmath105 to 40@xmath105 . if the particles are millimeter - sized , @xmath5 = 1 , then the geminids could be supplied in steady - state by 4 @xmath106 40 outbursts like the one observed , each orbit .    however , there is no compelling physical reason to assume that geminid stream production is in steady state .",

    "this radius directly affects estimates of the ejected mass through equation ( [ mass ] ) and so determines the extent to which on - going activity in phaethon contributes to the geminid stream .",
    "2 .   what is the origin of the @xmath00.5 day phase lag between perihelion and the anomalous brightening in both 2009 and 2012 ? is the brightening always lagged relative to perihelion by this amount ? 3 .   how many brightening events occur per orbit and are these events always of the same amplitude ? the nature of the stereo data curtails our ability to detect brightening events outside a limited window of accessibility .",
    "4 .   can evidence for mass loss be detected when phaethon is far from perihelion , despite past , failed attempts ?",
    "thermal fracture and mineral decomposition are likely only at the extreme temperatures found near perihelion .",

    "5 .   can spectra be obtained at perihelion in order to search for the forbidden lines of oxygen ? 6 .",
    "what is the mineralogical composition of phaethon and are hydrated silicates present on its surface ? 7 .   can meteoroids ejected during recent perihelion events be detected and distinguished from older geminids ?",

    "this brightening lies in stark contrast to the monotonic fading expected from phase darkening on a macroscopic body .",
    "the most direct interpretation is that phaethon brightens because of a sudden increase in the scattering cross - section due to the ejection of dust with a mass @xmath98 4@xmath310@xmath4 kg , where @xmath5 is the effective dust radius in millimeters .",
    "a contribution from prompt emission by atomic oxygen can not be excluded .",
    "3 .   thermal fracture and the decomposition of hydrated silicates are two plausible mechanisms of dust production at the @xmath01000 k surface temperatures attained near perihelion .",
