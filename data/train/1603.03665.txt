    "momentum space topology is becoming the important tool for the study of the ground states of condensed matter systems ( for the review see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the momentum space topological invariants protect gapless fermions on the boundaries of topological insulators @xcite .",
    "topological invariants in momentum space protect also the bulk gapless fermions in dirac and weyl semi - metals @xcite .",
    "the large variety of topological defects and textures exist in the fermionic superfluids , and the gapless fermions associated with these objects are described by momentum space topology @xcite .",
    "momentum space topology was also discussed in the context of relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the topological invariants in momentum space have been considered for the lattice regularization of qft with wilson fermions .",
    "appearance of the massless fermions at the intermediate values of bare mass parameter was related to the jump of the introduced momentum space topological invariant .",
    "this invariant may actually be used for the description of a certain class of topological insulators . in @xcite the model with overlap fermions has been considered on the same grounds . in particular , the possible physical meaning of the zeros of the green function has been discussed .",
    "the appearance of zeros of the green function , in turn , has been discussed in the context of condensed matter physics ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    the momentum space topological invariants are expressed in terms of the green functions .",
    "therefore , they are applicable both to the non - interacting and to the interacting systems @xcite .",
    "suppose , that we start from the model without interactions .",
    "when the interactions are turned on , the value of the topological invariant is not changed until the phase transition is encountered .",
    "this means , that the properties of the system described by the given topological invariant are robust to the introduction of interactions .",
    "the more simple non - interacting model may be investigated in order to describe such properties of the complicated interacting system . in the present paper",
    "we apply momentum space topology to the description of the anomalous quantum hall effect ( aqhe ) in topological insulators and weyl semimetals . in @xcite",
    "we considered the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) ( mainly , in the framework of relativistic quantum field theory ) using the approach based on momentum space topology .",
    "here we briefly repeat our proof of the absence of the equilibrium bulk cme with the emphasis in the application to the solid state systems .",
    "actually , momentum space topology with topological invariants expressed through the green functions represents the alternative to the less powerful but more popular technique of berry curvature proposed to describe the qhe in @xcite and developed later in a number of publications ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the technique of berry curvature may be applied to the noninteracting condensed matter systems with green function of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the imaginary frequency while @xmath4 is the hamiltonian .",
    "unfortunately , this formalism does not allow to deal in a similar way with the interacting systems with more complicated dependence of the green function on the imaginary frequency .",
    "besides , in spite of all its advantages , the berry curvature formalism does not allow to describe the response of the system to the external magnetic ( rather than electric ) field . finally , the bulk - boundary correspondence remains out of this formalism .",
    "those three points are improved in the technique that utilizes the topological invariants composed directly of the green functions .",
    "it was proposed first by g.e.volovik ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "following @xcite in the present paper we develop this technique and give the relation between the electromagnetic response of electric current and the topological invariants in momentum space of both @xmath0d and @xmath1d systems . in the present paper we emphasise ,",
    "that those topological invariants are constructed of the wigner transform of the two - point green functions , which allows to apply the proposed methodology to the direct description of bulk - boundary correspondence . as for the berry curvature formalism",
    ", we demonstrate that it follows from our approach as a particular case .",
    "the family of the non - dissipative transport effects related to chiral anomaly has been widely discussed recently both in the context of the high energy physics and in the context of condensed matter theory @xcite . in particular , the possible appearance of such effects in the recently discovered dirac and weyl semimetals has been considered @xcite . besides , the possibility to observe those effects in relativistic heavy - ion collisions was proposed @xcite .",
    "the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) is the generation of electric current in the presence of external magnetic field and chiral chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the quantum hall effect in the @xmath0 d and the @xmath1 d systems is the appearance of electric current in the direction orthogonal to the direction of the applied electric field .",
    "the anomalous quantum hall effect ( aqhe ) is such an effect that takes place due to the internal properties of the system rather than due to the external magnetic field .",
    "recently its possible appearance in weyl semimetals has been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "the aqhe was also discussed in the @xmath1d topological insulators @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we consider aqhe within the lattice regularized quantum field theory and within the tight - binding models of the solid state physics .",
    "the expression of the hall current ( through the topological invariant in momentum space @xmath5 ) in the quasi two dimensional condensed matter systems is well - known @xcite .",
    "we reproduce this result basing on the technique of the derivative expansion applied to the wigner transform of the two - point green function .",
    "next , we apply the same technique to the aqhe in the @xmath1 d lattice models .",
    "the obtained expression relates the aqhe current to the new topological invariant .",
    "the technique of its calculation is developed .",
    "our methodology allows to predict the appearance of the aqhe both in the weyl semi - metals and in certain topological insulators .",
    "we represent here the consideration of the equilibrium cme , which was based on the same technique .",
    "it appears , that the resulting current is also proportional to the topological invariant in momentum space . unlike the case of the naive continuum fermions for the considered lattice models with regular fermionic green function",
    "the value of the mentioned topological invariant does not depend on the chiral chemical potential .",
    "we consider the case , when the lattice dirac fermions are massive .",
    "however , the limit , when the physical dirac mass tends to zero , does not change our conclusion .",
    "this indicates , that the equilibrium bulk cme current is absent for the lattice regularized quantum field theory and in the certain class of solids .",
    "notice , that our conclusions on aqhe and cme are in accordance with the recent consideration of the particular lattice model of weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "the conclusion on the absence of the equilibrium bulk cme is in line with the recent numerical calculations made using the particular lattice models @xcite .",
    "it also does not contradict to the consideration of the effective continuum field theoretic description of weyl / dirac semimetals @xcite and the consideration of dirac semimetals in the framework of the semi - classical approach @xcite .",
    "besides , this conclusion is in accordance with the bloch theorem @xcite .",
    "we incorporate the slowly varying external gauge field directly to the momentum space representation of the lattice model@xcite . in this representation",
    "it appears as a pseudo - differential operator @xmath6 , where @xmath7 determines the functional dependence of the gauge field on coordinates , while @xmath8 is the derivative over momentum .",
    "such an introduction of the gauge field to the lattice model deforms it at small distances ( of the order of the lattice spacing ) . however , the gauge invariance remains intact , and at large distances the theory is indistinguishable from the lattice model with the external gauge field introduced in a conventional way .",
    "therefore , the given way to introduce the electromagnetic field satisfies all requirements to be imposed on the lattice regularization of the qft .",
    "we also consider this appropriate to apply this method to the lattice models of solid state physics if the long range phenomena are to be investigated .",
    "we demonstrate explicitly , that in the particular case of the noninteracting condensed matter system our formalism allows to reproduce the expression for the hall conductivity as an integral over the berry curvature ( the green function of such system has the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the imaginary frequency while @xmath4 is the hamiltonian ) .",

    "<S> using derivative expansion applied to the wigner transform of the two - point green function we analyse the anomalous quantum hall effect ( aqhe ) , and the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding currents are proportional to the momentum space topological invariants . </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce the conventional expression for the hall conductivity in @xmath0 d. in @xmath1 d our analysis allows to explain systematically the aqhe in topological insulators and weyl semimetals . at the same time using this method it may be proved , that the equilibrium cme is absent in the wide class of solids , as well as in the properly regularized relativistic quantum field theory . </S>"
