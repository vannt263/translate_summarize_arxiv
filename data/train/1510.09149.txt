    "the advent of space - based transit surveys such as _ corot _  @xcite and _ _ kepler _ _  @xcite has provided a major breakthrough for exoplanetary science , in terms of both the number of discoveries and the precision of measured exoplanet radii . unfortunately , the second reaction wheel of the _ _ kepler _ _  spacecraft failed in may 2013 affecting the pointing precision of the telescope .",
    "the mission  now called k2  has been resumed in 2014 by adopting a different observing strategy that uses only two reaction wheels and thrusters to control the pointing of the telescope @xcite .",
    "the capability of k2 to detect small transiting planets in short period orbits around relatively bright stars has recently been shown ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    although much interest is focused on finding earth - size planets because they are central to astrobiology",
    ", hot jupiters still remain important targets for investigating migration mechanisms and star - planet tidal interactions .",
    "only 21 hot jupiters ( @xmath4 ) on planetary orbits smaller than 1.3-days are confirmed to date ( august 2016 ; see exoplanet.eu ) .",
    "we report here the discovery of , a short - period giant planet transiting a v=10.8  mag star observed by the k2 mission . we combined the k2 photometry with ground - based follow - up observations to confirm the system and derive its fundamental parameters .",
    "we have also shown that grazing transits can entail a correlation between the relative stellar radius @xmath5 and the orbital inclination @xmath6 means an edge - on observation of the transiting planet in front of the star . ] when estimating the system parameters .",
    "this paper is the collaborative work of two teams dedicated to the detection , analysis and follow - up of k2 targets , namely the kepler exoplanet science team ( kest ) and the esprint team @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the original kepler mission , k2 provides only target pixel files and not `` ready - to - use '' detrended light curves .",
    "the target pixel files contain images with the calibrated flux , the subtracted background , and the removed cosmic rays .",
    "the light curve was automatically extracted by using a software developed by the rhenish institut for environmental research , department of planetary research ( riu - pf ) .",
    "the software detects the target stars in the pixel files , calculates the stellar masks , compensates the translation of the targets on the ccd by shifting the masks , integrates the flux within the stellar masks , and creates a light curve by listing the integrated flux from each pixel file as a function of time ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] , upper panel ) .",
    "flux variations caused by the rotational drift of the spacecraft and the periodic pointing corrections of the thrusters are corrected using a technique similar to those used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the k2 light curves of campaign 2 were independently processed and searched for planetary transits by two teams within our collaboration , namely , the dlr in berlin and the riu - pf in cologne , using two different software packages ( ` dst ` , @xcite ; ` exotrans ` , @xcite ) .",
    "prior to the transit search , the cologne team filtered the light curves using the wavelet based filter ` varlet ` and ` phalet ` @xcite to reduce stellar variabilities and instrument systematics ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] , lower panel ) .",
    "a transit - like signal with a depth of 0.6% occurring every @xmath251.26 days was detected by both teams in the light curve of k2 - 31 ( fig .",
    "[ transit ] ) .",
    "since the transit is v - shaped it was suspected that it might be caused by an eclipsing binary whose light contaminates the mask of the target star .",
    "the candidate was not discarded though , because grazing transiting planets exhibit also v - shaped signals .",
    "since the star is relatively bright and first reconnaissance observations can be carried out quickly , the candidate was included in the list for follow - up observations .",
    "the confirmation of the planetary nature of this candidate came very promptly as described in sect .",
    "[ fu ] .    the unfiltered light curve of k2 - 31 shows also quasi - periodic flux variations with a peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath251% ( fig .",
    "the flux variability is very likely caused by magnetic active regions moving in and out of sight as the star rotates .",
    "the stellar rotation period was inferred to be @xmath26days using the autocorrelation method described in @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations were performed in order to exclude the false positive scenario @xcite and to derive the mass of the planet .",
    "high resolution imaging of k2 - 31 was obtained on 15 april 2015 using the fastcam lucky imaging camera at the 1.5-m carlos sanchez telescope in tenerife .",
    "ten data cubes of 1000 images were taken , each with an exposure time of 50ms .",
    "the data were reduced following @xcite .",
    "the frames were shifted and co - added to produce a final , high snr , high resolution image .",

    "companions with @xmath30mag@xmath31 can be discarded as close as @xmath32 .",
    "the radial velocity ( rv ) follow - up of k2 - 31 started in may 2015 with the fies spectrograph @xcite mounted at the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) of roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma , spain ) .",
    "six high - resolution spectra ( r=67000 ) at an exposure time to 1520 minutes were aquired , which resulted in a snr of 3038 per pixel at 5500  in the extracted spectra .",
    "the rv drift of the instrument was traced by taking long - exposure ( @xmath33@xmath3430sec ) thar spectra right before and after each observation following the observing strategy described by @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures and rv measurements were extracted via multi - order cross - correlation with the rv standard star , observed with the same instrument set - up as the target object .",
    "three additional spectra were collected in june 2015 with the harps spectrograph @xcite mounted at the 3.6-m eso telescope ( la silla , chile ) as part of the eso program 095.c-0718(a ) .",
    "the exposure time was 20  minutes resulting in a snr of 3656 per pixel at 5500  in the extracted spectra .",
    "radial velocities were obtained by multi - order cross - correlation with a numerical mask using the harps pipeline .    the fies and harps",
    "rv measurements are listed in table  [ rv - table ] , along with the error bars , barycentric julian dates in barycentric dynamical time , and the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) bisector spans .",

    "figure  [ rv - curve ] shows the rv measurements  after subtracting the rv offset between the two instruments and the systemic velocity  phase - folded to the orbital period ( upper panel ) , along with the rv residuals ( lower panel ) .",
    "no significant correlation between the ccf bisector spans and the rvs was found indicating that the doppler shifts observed in k2 - 31 are induced by the orbital motion of the planet rather than stellar activity or a blended eclipsing binary .",
